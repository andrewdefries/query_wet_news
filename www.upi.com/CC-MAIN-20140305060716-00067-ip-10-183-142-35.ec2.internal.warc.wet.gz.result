| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 (UPI) -- A government watchdog said the U.S. Treasury Department signed off on big pay increases at bailout firms in 2012, ignoring taxpayers' interests."We expect Treasury to look out for taxpayers who funded the bailout of these companies by holding the line on excessive pay," said Christy Romero, the inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program that was used to bail out the nation's financial industry, as well as select firms, such as General Motors, Chrysler and American Insurance Group Inc."Treasury cannot look out for taxpayers' interests if it continues to rely to a great extent on the pay proposed by companies that have historically pushed back on pay limits."The Washington Post reported Monday the Treasury Department claims it did not break any laws or turn its back on taxpayers as it approved $6.2 million in raises for 18 executives at GM, Ally Financial and AIG in 2012.The department approved a raise of $1 million for one AIG executive. Another, an executive at AIG's Residential Capital that filed for bankruptcy, was allowed a $200,000 raise in what the inspector general's report said was a raise approval process that deferred to the requests made by the companies and ignored pay increases based on merit, the Post said.The report also says that 68 of 69 executives at the three companies took home pay packages of $2 million or more. Combined, the top 16 executives at the companies took home $100 million, The New York Times reported."In 2012, these three TARP companies convinced Treasury to roll back its guidelines by approving multimillion-dollar pay packages, high cash salaries, huge pay raises and removing compensation tied to meeting performance metrics," Romer said.The Treasury Department's acting pay czar, Patricia Geoghegan, said the inspector general's audit includes many inadequacies and faulty conclusions.Huge compensation packages became a sore point after the financial crisis of 2008 and throughout the subsequent bailout of the financial sector. Billions of dollars of taxpayer funds were used to bail out companies that blundered into and, in some ways, created the financial crisis.Symbolic of the compensation controversy, AIG was severely criticized for awarding $168 million in bonus pay in 2009 to employees of the division that sustained huge losses in the market, destabilizing the insurance giant and putting the financial system at risk.Kenneth Feinberg was appointed to serve as the department's so-called pay czar to monitor excessive pay at bailed-out firms. His strategy was to limit cash salaries to $500,000 and force companies to award deferred shares to make up the difference.Feinberg stepped down in 2010. In 2012, the report says, Geoghegan allowed 23 exceptions to Feinberg's guidelines, four times the number of exceptions allowed in 2009.

With the addition of 100,000 borrowers, the total number of borrowers who moved from negative equity to positive equity by September reached 1.4 million year-to-date. An additional 2.3 million borrowers had less than 5 percent equity in their home, referred to as near-negative equity, at the end of the third quarter, according to a new analysis from CoreLogic.
Together, negative equity and near-negative equity mortgages accounted for 26.8 percent of all residential properties with a mortgage nationwide in the third quarter of 2012, down from 27 percent at the end of the second quarter in 2012. Nationally, negative equity decreased from $689 billion at the end of the second quarter in 2012 to $658 billion at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of $31 billion. This decrease was driven in large part by an improvement in house price levels. This dollar amount represents the total value of all homes currently underwater nationally.
Rising home values also pushed the equity Americans have in their homes higher than at it was at the onset of the housing crash five years ago, according to the December HUD Scorecard. Homeowners’ equity reached $7714.3 billion, a 5.2 percent increase over the second quarter and an 18 percent increase over the level of $6526.9 in the third quarter of 20011. In 2007, homeowners’ equity reached $1.02 trillion, but fell to $7050.9 billion in 2008, according to the quarterly Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds report.
Negative equity has been a major cause of foreclosures and short sales. Even three years after the height of the foreclosure flood in 2010, a handful of states that were reasonable then for the majority of the foreclosures are the same states that today are home to an overabundance of underwater homes.
Nevada had the highest percentage of mortgaged properties in negative equity at 56.9 percent, followed by Florida (42.1 percent), Arizona (38.6 percent), Georgia (35.6 percent) and Michigan (32 percent). These top five states combined account for 34 percent of the total amount of negative equity in the U.S.
Of the total $658 billion in aggregate negative equity, first liens without home equity loans accounted for $323 billion aggregate negative equity, while first liens with home equity loans accounted for $334 billion.
Third quarter highlights included:
-- 6.6 million upside-down borrowers hold first liens without home equity loans. The average mortgage balance for this group of borrowers is $214,000. The average underwater amount is $49,000.
-- 4.1 million upside-down borrowers possess both first and second liens. The average mortgage balance for this group of borrowers is $298,000.The average underwater amount is $82,000.
-- Approximately 41 percent of borrowers with first liens without home equity loans had loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of 80 percent or higher and approximately 61 percent of borrowers with first liens and home equity loans had combined LTVs of 80 percent or higher.
-- At the end of the third quarter 2012, 17.1 million borrowers possessed qualifying LTVs between 80 and 125 percent for the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) under the original requirements first introduced in March 2009. The lifting of the 125 percent LTV cap via HARP 2.0 opens the door to another 4.6 million borrowers.

LEXINGTON, Ky., Feb. 8 (UPI) -- U.S. researchers working with international colleagues say they've found a clue to age-related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of blindness.A study by researchers at the University of Kentucky and others, published in the journal Nature, found an enzyme known as DICER1 stops functioning, leading to the onset of the condition, the BBC reported Monday.The disease affects the macula, a part of the eye at the center of the retina responsible for resolving fine detail at the center of the field of vision.As the disease progresses the central vision deteriorates, making reading, driving and recognizing faces difficult.The researchers found the DICER1 enzyme was less active in the retina of people with the more common "dry form" of the disease.DICER1 is necessary for destroying small pieces of genetic material called Alu RNA which can accumulate with toxic affect leading to the deterioration of the retina, the researchers said."This work opens many new doors of research," lead researcher Professor Jayakrishna Ambati, from the University of Kentucky, said.The exact cause of AMD unknown, but risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure and having relatives diagnosed with the condition."This is a very interesting piece of research and provides us with another valuable piece of the AMD jigsaw," Cathy Yelf, spokesperson for the Macular Disease Society, said."It will not change a thing for patients immediately but it may lead to new treatments in the long term."

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Oct. 7 (UPI) -- Clutch pitching by Joaquin Benoit and Jose Valverde Thursday moved the Detroit Tigers deeper into the playoffs with a 3-2 win over the New York Yankees.With each pitch in the late innings creating drama befitting the significance of the occasion, the Tigers won the fifth and deciding contest in the post-season's opening round and will meet the Texas Rangers in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series.Game 1 of that confrontation will be played Saturday in Texas, with the Rangers trying to win their second league title in as many years.Detroit never trailed Thursday, getting first-inning solo homers from Don Kelly and Delmon Young and an RBI single from Victor Martinez in the fifth to take a 3-0 lead.The Tigers fought off New York the rest of the way despite putting themselves in situations where the Yankees could have turned the game around with a single swing of the bat.New York twice left the bases loaded, once in the fourth inning when starter Doug Fister retired Russell Martin and Brett Gardner on pop fly balls to escape the jam. It was in the seventh inning, however, that the Yankees missed a huge chance to take the lead.Benoit came on in relief of Max Scherzer with one out and one on and the Yankees promptly filled the bases on a single by Curtis Granderson and a slow ground ball from Robinson Cano that Benoit misplayed into an infield hit.Benoit then got Alex Rodriguez on a swinging strike three, walked Mark Teixeira to force in New York's second run of the game and finally fanned Nick Swisher to end the inning.Valverde, who had 49 regular-season saves, appeared in the ninth and retired the side in order. With the New York crowd screaming for a rally, Granderson flew out to left, Cano lined out to center while breaking his bat and Rodriguez again struck out swinging.It was the second straight year Rodriguez recorded New York's final out of the season with a strikeout. He did the same thing when the Yankees were eliminated in Game 6 against Texas in last year's ALCS.New York starter Ivan Nova left the game after two innings with a strained forearm.Young was taken out for Detroit in the seventh with what was described as a pulled muscle in his left side.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands, June 11 (UPI) -- The International Criminal Court expressed concern about the safety of staff members detained after trying to meet with Moammar Gadhafi's son in Libya.Four members of the International Criminal Court were detained in the Libyan town of Zintan last week. The ICC team was there trying to meet with Saif al-Islam Gadhafi.ICC President Song Sang-hyun said the court, based in The Hague, Netherlands, was concerned about the welfare of the staff members. He said the court was in contact with authorities in Libya to secure their release but hasn't had contact with the missing members."These four international civil servants have immunity when on an official ICC mission," Song said in a statement. "I call on the Libyan authorities to immediately take all necessary measures to ensure their safety and security and to liberate them."The ICC in June 2011 issued arrest warrants for Saif al-Islam and former Libyan intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi for alleged crimes against humanity, notably murder and persecution, committed allegedly in Libya during the early stages of last year's civil war.The interim administration in Tripoli submitted a challenge to the ICC claiming Saif al-Islam and Senussi should be tried before national courts.

EVERETT, Wash., Dec. 31 (UPI) -- A Washington state couple were jailed on charges they allegedly smoking methamphetamine in the presence of an 11-month-old baby, a county prosecutor said.The unidentified suspects, a 22-year-old woman and her 35-year-old half-brother boyfriend, were arrested Dec. 7 by Marysville police after they allegedly were seen smoking meth in an unheated and out-of-gas parked vehicle, with the woman's baby in her lap, the Everett Daily Herald reported Monday.The baby was clad only in a diaper and appeared to be cold and hungry, said Snonomish County deputy prosecutor Andrew Alsdorf, noting the temperature that night was 38 degrees.The couple, held under $150,000 bail, were charged with one count each of child endangerment with a controlled substance, court papers said. Authorities also seek to keep them away from the woman's three children, the newspaper said.The couple's names were withheld to protect the identity of the children.

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, Sept. 19 (UPI) -- Cambodia is increasing the use of threats, intimidation and murder to suppress political dissent, say a number human rights groups.Activists attending a forum sponsored by the Cambodian Center for Human Rights made the charges Tuesday, The Phnom Penh Post reported.CCHR president Ou Virak alleged that police and courts were being exploited as a way of instilling fear and intimidation into the political dissidents."Rights abuses by government officials are largely ignored, he said.An analysis provided by forum organizers found that since 1990 15 rights activists, politicians and policy reformers had died in suspicious circumstances. Some 1,440 have been charged with a crime.The deaths of environmental activist Chut Wutty and journalist Hang Serei Oudo were handled properly by authorities, said Am Sam Ath, senior investigator for the rights group Licadho.Those incidents are "hugely important," he said, noting that Cambodia is now chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations "and a democratic country where freedom of expression should be wide open to everyone."Phay Siphan, a spokesman for the Council of Ministers, accused the groups of linking separate incidents as a means of attacking the government."They can't represent the freedom of expression as a whole nationwide," he said

| License Photo	Feb. 25 (UPI) -- On one side of the Hill, there's a quiet effort underway in Congress to abolish the Selective Service System, more commonly known as military draft registration.Down the hall, in the Senate, other lawmakers are pushing instead to expand the draft registration now that the Pentagon has opened combat positions up to women.Reps. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Mike Coffman, R-Colo., are spearheading an effort in the House of Representatives to see the registration abolished, calling it a waste of money considering the success of the all-volunteer force."There is no one who wants this except 'chicken hawk' members of Congress," DeFazio said, referring to his colleagues who push for military action without having served themselves, who he accuses of being afraid to look weak on national security by supporting closing the agency.The Selective Service costs $24 million a year, maintaining a database of 17 million potential draftees--all male--in the event the draft were to be reinstated.Conscription was officially ended in 1973, but all young men between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register.Selective Service director Lawrence Romo, while calling the agency an "inexpensive insurance policy," said it's "the true backup for the true emergency."He'll likely find agreement from lawmakers on the other side of the Capitol building, including Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.Levin, who said he supports the expansion of the draft registration to include women, has the support of groups such as the Service Women's Action Network, who consider a women's exemption a sign of lingering inequality in the military.“SWAN advocates for the inclusion of women into Selective Service,” said Anu Bhagwati, executive director of SWAN and a former Marine Corps captain, to NBC News. “Lifting the ban on women officially serving in combat is about giving qualified women the opportunity to serve and making our military stronger, and that would include having women register for Selective Service."In making his announcement to lift the prohibition on women in combat roles, outgoing Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned the Selective Service to prepare for the possible increase in workload, should policymakers begin to include women in the draft registration. The deadline for military departments to provide implementation plans is May 15.
