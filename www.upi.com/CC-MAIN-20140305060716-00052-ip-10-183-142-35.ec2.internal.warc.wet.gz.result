ALBANY, N.Y., March 30 (UPI) -- Officials at the New York State Department of Health expanded a New York City recommendation regarding meningococcal vaccinations for men having sex with men.Earlier this month the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued meningococcal vaccine recommendations in response to an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease in New York City.Meningococcal disease is a severe bacterial infection of the bloodstream. Common symptoms include high fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and a rash, health officials said. Symptoms may occur two to 10 days after exposure, but usually within five days. Since 2010, 22 men residing in New York City and one man who resided outside the city, but spent significant time there, became ill and seven died, officials said The recommendation by the state Department of Health expanded to include men having sex with men residing outside New York City who have traveled to the city and engaged in the risk behaviors described below since Sept. 1, 2012.The following groups were as being at highest risk and advised to obtain a quadravalent meningococcal vaccination:-- Men having sex with men, regardless of HIV status, who regularly have close or intimate sexual contact with men met via an online website, digital "app", or at a bar or party. Previously, meningococcal vaccination was recommended only for those with contact in certain high risk areas in New York City.-- HIV positive individuals who do not have a healthcare provider. Those whose healthcare provider does not currently have the meningococcal vaccine can find vaccinations and/or healthcare services at: www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/resources/resource_directory/. Other individuals can visit www.nysacho.org and use the directory to find contact information for their local health department, which also may have the vaccine.

Tony Stewart fined, put on probation DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., Aug. 7 (UPI) -- Hot-tempered Tony Stewart was fined $10,000 and placed on probation Tuesday by NASCAR after punching a photographer following Sunday's Brickyard 400.Stewart was penalized for "actions detrimental to stock car racing" and is on probation until Dec. 31. In addition to the fine and probation, the 31-year-old Winston Cup driver also will be required to apologize the Indianapolis Star freelance photographer Gary Mook, who downplayed the incident."It is imperative that we protect the integrity of our sport," NASCAR president Mike Helton said. "This type of behavior cannot be tolerated and is in no way indicative of the manner in which our drivers, teams, tracks and sponsors interact with the media. We take pride in our accessibility and interaction with the media and we intend to protect that relationship."Stewart led 43 laps after starting from the pole and was a contender late in the race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But the handling on his Pontiac Grand Prix started to give and his chances to win faded. The native of Rushville, Ind., finished 12th and was visibly upset.As Stewart was heading to the team transporter to exit the speedway, Mook took several pictures, which irritated Stewart. According to witnesses, Stewart took several swings at the photographer, including a few that made contact.76ers trade Mutombo to Nets PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 6 (UPI) -- The Philadelphia 76ers traded 7-2 Dikembe Mutombo to the New Jersey Nets Tuesday for forward Keith Van Horn and center Todd MacCulloch.A four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, Mutombo was acquired by the 76ers at the 2001 trading deadline. He helped carry them to the NBA Finals, where he squared off against Shaquille O'Neal and the Los Angeles Lakers.Mutombo did as well as anyone could against the game's best player, averaging 16.8 points, 12.2 rebounds and 2.2 blocks while matched up against O'Neal as the Sixers lost in five games.The Nets supplanted the Sixers as Eastern Conference champions and also encountered the Lakers in the Finals. MacCulloch was unable to slow O'Neal, who averaged 36.3 points and demoralized every defense thrown at him.The Nets felt they needed another star to complement All-Star point guard Jason Kidd, who can be a free agent at the end of the 2002-03 season. They may have gotten one in Mutombo, although they will pay a pretty penny for him.Last summer, Mutombo, 36, signed a four-year, $68 million contract. He becomes New Jersey's highest-paid player and is signed through the 2004-05 season, an issue in the luxury tax era.Van Horn is entering the third year of a six-year, $73 million extension. MacCulloch just completed the first year of a six-year, $34 million deal.Hewitt rebounds; Chang upsets Haas CINCINNATI, Aug. 7 (UPI) -- After stumbling last week, world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt returned on Tuesday in overpowering form as the Australian top seed whitewashed American qualifier Robby Ginepri, 6-0, 6-0, in the opening round of the $2.95 million hardcourt Tennis Masters Series - Cincinnati.Meanwhile, veteran American Michael Chang converted three break-point opportunities and saved three against his serve to upset Germany's Tommy Haas, the third seed, 6-3, 6-2.Hewitt recorded the double whitewash after losing to Felix Mantilla in three sets last week at the Tennis Masters Series - Canada in his first match since claiming his second career Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in July. The top seed from Australia has won four tournaments this season, including two on hardcourts. Hewitt, 21, made the semifinals here last year, one month before claiming the U.S. Open.A two-time champion here, Chang outdueled Haas for the second time in as many career meetings. The 30-year-old also beat Haas in the quarterfinals of the 1998 San Jose hardcourt event.The seven-time Tennis Masters Series winner recorded his 40th career match win at Cincinnati. Chang took sole possession of second place on the all-time match-wins list at this event, moving past American Jimmy Connors. With 45, only Sweden's Stefan Edberg owns a greater tally.Report: Blackhawks to sign FleuryDENVER, Aug. 7 (UPI) -- The Denver Post reported Tuesday that right wing THeo Fleury, a member of Canada's gold medal-winning team at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, is close to signing with the Chicago Blackhawks. The Blackhawks are in need of a goal scorer after the departure of right wing Tony Amonte, who signed with the Phoenix Coyotes last month.Fleury, 34, would reunite with Blackhawks coach Brian Sutter, who coached Fleury in Calgary in 1997-98 and 1998-99.A three-time 40-goal scorer, Fleury spent the last three seasons with the New York Rangers, but was traded to the San Jose Sharks for a draft choice in the offseason even though he was on the verge of becoming an unrestricted free agent.Fleury has been beset by personal problems the past two years, including a stay at a drug rehabilitation facility for the final two months of the 2000-01 campaign. Last season, he drew the ire of Rangers coaches with frequent outbursts and ill-timed penalties, resulting in a career-high 216 penalty minutes. He played in all 82 games and had 24 goals and 39 assists.Fleury spent his first 11 seasons with Calgary before he was traded to Colorado in February 1999 and signed with the Rangers in July 1999. He has 443 career goals and 612 assists for 1,055 points in 1,030 games.Rangers place OF Hollandsworth on DL ARLINGTON, Texas, Aug. 7 (UPI) -- The Texas Rangers placed outfielder Todd Hollandsworth on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday with a strained left quadriceps muscle. Hollandsworth sustained the injury running to first base in the fifth inning of last Saturday's game against the Boston Red Sox. Acquired from the Colorado Rockies in a four-player deal just before the July 31 non-waiver trading deadline, Hollandsworth had three hits in 10 at-bats with one homer and four RBI in three games with the Rangers. He started two games in center field and one in left. Hollandsworth, 29, hit .295 with 11 homers and 48 RBI in 95 games for the Rockies this season. The 1996 National League Rookie of the Year, Hollandsworth is a career .280 hitter.The Rangers recalled first baseman Travis Hafner from Class AAA Oklahoma to replace Hollandsworth. Hafner batted .338 with 19 homers and 72 RBI in 104 games for Oklahoma. He leads the Pacific Coast League in on-base percentage (.458) and is fourth in hitting.Baseball labor talks stepped upNEW YORK, Aug. 7 (UPI) -- Labor negotiators for Major League Baseball and the players association resumed their stepped-up collective bargaining talks Tuesday after a marathon Monday session opened a "crucial week" with what was described as "some progress."Tuesday's day-long meetings were to be split by a conference call between the union hierarchy and baseball's 30 player representatives. The union will discuss whether they believe setting a strike date is appropriate.Some player reps said a strike date would not be set on Tuesday's conference call, but Aug. 12 has been set aside for a full in-person meeting of the executive board; only five games are scheduled for that day.Long discussions Monday were about the core economic issue of revenue sharing and both sides agreed to a package of non-economic issues that had been introduced by the owners last month. The package was the second resolved since negotiations resumed in earnest the beginning of June.Denver drops veteran receiverGREELEY, Colo., Aug. 7 (UPI) -- Long-time NFL wideout Rob Moore was looking for work Tuesday after he was waived by the Denver Broncos.Moore, in his 13th season out of Syracuse, was signed by the Broncos April 1, 2002, after being waived by the Arizona Cardinals Feb. 27. He has missed the past two NFL seasons because of a torn left ACL (2000) and a torn right hamstring (2001). Despite his recent injury history, he was determined to make a comeback this summer, but missed a schedule practice on Monday after suffering a groin strain on Saturday. He may have seen the handwriting.Moore, 33, has played in 153 games (150 starts) in his 12-year career. He caught 628 passes for 9,368 yards (14.9) and 49 touchdowns. But, he had been listed as Denver's fourth-string wide receiver in training camp.Rocker apologizes for anti-gay remarksDALLAS, Aug. 7 (UPI) -- Texas Rangers pitcher John Rocker had some more explaining to do after making what were described as anti-gay comments to patrons at a popular Dallas restaurant, the Dallas Morning News said Tuesday.Rocker issued a written apology for his actions through the Rangers. He said he was having brunch with his girlfriend Sunday afternoon at Breadwinners Café and Bakery when he was badgered and baited by nearby patrons. He said a group followed him outside and made an obscene gesture. "At that point, I admit I was angry and said some things I probably should not have said," said Rocker. "But I wanted to make it clear their attentions were unwelcome." However, Richard Garcia, who waited on Rocker and his girlfriend, said the ballplayer was not provoked by other patrons.In February 2000, Rocker was suspended for two weeks and fined $500 for making remarks critical of minorities, gays and others in a Sports Illustrated article.Reds get Hamilton back, lose DessensCINCINNATI, Aug. 7 (UPI) -- The Cincinnati Reds, battling for the lead in the National League Central, activated righthander Joey Hamilton from the 15-day disabled list Tuesday. But, they will be without Elmer Dessens for a while.Hamilton won 40 games for the San Diego Padres from 1996-98, but has just 18 victories since. This year, he is 3-6 with a 5.21 ERA in 16 starts for Cincinnati (58-52), which trails first-place St. Louis by two games in the NL Central. The 31-year-old Hamilton had been on the disabled list since July 17 with a strained left hamstring. The same injury also had him on the DL from May 5-22.Dessens was placed on the 15-day DL, retroactive to Aug. 2, with a strained right groin. He is third in the NL with a 2.67 ERA and is 7-5 in 23 starts this year.

| License Photo	DETROIT, Sept. 8 (UPI) -- Incoming Detroit Mayor Ken Cockrel says he had a "productive" meeting Monday with current Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick to discuss the transition of city power. Cockrel, the Detroit City Council president, said the meeting was called to discuss the upcoming transition as Kilpatrick, who resigned last week after pleading guilty to corruption charges, prepares to serve a jail sentence, the Detroit Free Press reported. Emerging from the meeting, Cockrel told reporters, "It was a very good meeting. I thought it was a very productive meeting," adding that it lasted about 90 minutes, 20 of which he spent talking privately with Kilpatrick. Cockrel will officially take office as Detroit's interim mayor Sept. 19, officials said. Sharon McPhail, Kilpatrick's former general counsel, announced she will chair his transition team until Cockrel takes over as mayor, the Free Press said. Kilpatrick pleaded guilty last week to felony perjury charges stemming from an $8.4 million city payout to whistle-blower police officers. The settlement included a secret requirement that the officers keep quiet about incriminating Kilpatrick text messages they possessed.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 (UPI) -- U.S. President Obama leads Republican nominee Mitt Romney by 8 points among likely voters, a poll by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press indicated.The poll, released Wednesday, showed Obama was preferred by 51 percent of likely voters, while 43 percent backed Romney.The poll was conducted Sept. 12-16, so its results do not reflect voter sentiment following Monday's disclosure of controversial comments Romney made in a talk with donors in Florida, in which he said "there are 47 percent who are with [Obama], who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to healthcare, to food, to housing, to you-name-it -- that that's an entitlement -- and the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what."Romney has come in for criticism from conservative Republicans as well as Democrats for the comments but has repeated the argument several times this week.The Pew poll released Wednesday indicated Obama has a larger September lead than the three most recent nominees who went on to win the presidential election in November, Pew said.Obama's favorability rating is 55 percent, up from 50 percent in late July, and his unfavorability rating is 42 percent. Romney's favorability rating in the new poll is 45 percent, up from 37 percent in July, and his unfavorability rating is 50 percent.The Pew poll surveyed 3,019 adults, including 2,424 registered voters. Pew did not report a margin of sampling error but said it would be available on request, and said the survey had a 95 percent level of confidence for different groups participating in the poll.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 (UPI) -- A former U.S. congressional staffer warned monetary assistance for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system may be jeopardized if budget cuts go into effect.Randy Jennings, a defense industry consultant and former congressional aide, said if planned cuts in the U.S. budget take effect, financial aid for Israel's Iron Dome system and other military expenditures will likely be reduced, The Jerusalem Post said."Iron Dome will be cut. ... There will be no sacred cows ... All the programs will be hit," the paper quoted Jennings as saying at a Heritage Foundation panel Tuesday in reference to the sequester, which requires deep cuts in U.S. spending unless Congress acts to block them by the end of the year.Half of the initial $100 billion in reductions are to come from defense spending. Congress is expected to address the issue after the Nov. 6 elections."As sequestration kicks in, the pressures are going to build, I think pretty dramatically, to provide more discretion in terms of how the cuts are applied," said Baker Spring, a national security fellow at The Heritage Foundation who participated in the event.Lt. Col. Merav Davidovits, an Israeli Embassy liaison officer who also appeared on the panel, said Israel is aware of the economic situation in the United States. She stressed the Iron Dome missile defense system not only protects Israel, but also U.S. interests in the region and provides jobs to Americans, the paper said.Israel has received hundreds of millions of dollars for the Iron Dome system in addition to $3 billion in annual military assistance from the United States, the paper said.

HARTFORD, Conn., Oct. 23 (UPI) -- A Connecticut judge Wednesday ordered a new trial for Kennedy relative Michael Skakel, ruling the lawyer who defended him in 2002 was ineffective. Skakel, 52, nephew of Robert Kennedy's wife, Ethel, was sentenced to 20 years to life for killing Martha Moxley, a neighbor in Greenwich, Conn., in 1975 when they were both 15. Hubert Santos, a member of his current legal team, told the Hartford Courant he plans to ask for Skakel's release on bail pending a new trial. "It's been 11 years in the making," Santos said of Judge Thomas Bishop's decision. Bishop, in a 135-page opinion, described Skakel's trial lawyer, Michael "Mickey" Sherman, as "in a myriad of ways ineffective.""The defense of a serious felony prosecution requires attention to detail, an energetic investigation and a coherent plan of defense capably executed," the judge wrote. "Trial counsel's failures in each of these areas of representation were significant and, ultimately, fatal to a constitutionally adequate defense."If Bishop's ruling is upheld on appeal, the state will have the choice of releasing or retrying Skakel. Skakel's trial, more than a quarter century after the crime, would have been sensational without the Kennedy connection. Moxley was killed with a golf club in the wealthy Greenwich neighborhood where her family and the Skakels lived.

CANBERRA, Australia, April 6 (UPI) -- Defense Minister Stephen Smith has warned cadets at the Australian Defense Force Academy that inappropriate conduct "cannot and will not be tolerated."The warning came after allegations of a sex scandal at the academy in Canberra. The academy has called in the Federal Police to investigate claims six male cadets secretly used a Web cam to broadcast live footage of another cadet having consensual sex with an 18-year-old female colleague.The woman, known only as "Kate," told the Ten Television Network she did not know she was being filmed and said she was "physically ill" when investigators told her what had happened.If the allegation is proven, the cadets will be dismissed from the academy and the military, Smith said Wednesday."I can't think of a greater betrayal of trust of a colleague in the workplace than the suggestions that have been made," Smith told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

| License Photo	LONDON, Aug. 17 (UPI) -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says he is certain former U.S. national security consultant Edward Snowden has not been grilled by Russian intelligence.Assange told Britain's Fairfax Media his organization has had someone with the fugitive Snowden every day for nearly two months and there have been no debriefings by Russian security agencies."Since Hong Kong we have had someone physically by his side the entire time," Assange said. "We have had someone with him for 54 days."Snowden's jump from Hong Kong to Moscow, where he received temporary asylum, raised alarm in the United States that he was spilling secrets of the National Security Agency's sophisticated metadata surveillance programs to the Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB.Assange said WikiLeaks jumped into the Snowden situation out of an obligation he said the media in general had to support whistle-blowers by keeping their identities confidential, or publicly supporting them if they are unmasked."There is a moral obligation, and in order to maximize the amount of important information coming to the public, you have to make the source feel comfortable with that," Assange told Fairfax, which is owned by The Age.
