SACRAMENTO, June 21 (UPI) -- The Scottish government announced it teamed with the state government in California to examine bilateral cooperation on renewable energy programs.Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond arrived in California this week for a four-day working visit. Salmond announced he and California Gov. Jerry Brown would set up a joint working entity to examine renewable energy efforts.Salmond said both sides are committed to a low-carbon economy."Therefore it makes sense that we should combine our expertise to push forward innovation," he said.California state regulators embraced a target of getting 33 percent of their energy from renewable resources by 2020, one of the most aggressive targets in the United States. Scotland aims to derive 100 percent of its electricity demand through renewable energy projects by 2020."Reducing carbon emissions is absolutely critical to our well-being in California and Scotland and throughout the entire world," Brown said.

LONDON, Sept. 14 (UPI) -- Two of Europe's largest defense and aerospace groups may merge their businesses, a move that would significantly affect the sector worldwide if completed.British company BAE Systems PLC and EADS NV, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, indicated the discussions were beyond the preliminary stage. They also cautioned that any merger agreement would need approval from a number of governments as well as customary approvals from their respective boards of directors and stockholders."BAE Systems and EADS believe that the potential combination of their two businesses offers the prospect of significant benefits for customers and shareholders of both companies," BAE Systems said in a news release that confirmed industry and stock market speculation that a merger was in the works.These benefits include cost savings, such as from procurement and sourcing efficiencies available to the enlarged group, and substantial new business opportunities."But, it said, "there can be no certainty that the discussions will ultimately lead to a transaction."BAE Systems was founded in 1999 by the merger of Britain's Marconi Electronic Systems and British Aerospace. Its business portfolios cover a wide range of defense, aerospace and security products and services. Among major programs it and its worldwide subsidiaries are involved is the F-35 Lightning II jet fighter, the Eurofighter Typhoon, as well as in the building of Britain's Astute class submarines and the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers.EADS also has a broad business portfolio. Among the group's companies are Airbus, Astrium, Cassidian and Eurocopter.The companies, which have collaborated in the past, are working together on the Typhoon fighter and in various joint ventures of missile company MBDA.The merger plan being hashed out by BAE and EADS envisages an enlarged business group with a unified management structure, identical boards of directors and executive committees. EADS shareholders would own 60 percent of the new group, while BAE shareholders would own the remainder.Each would be listed separately on their respective stock exchanges. Special shares in BAE Systems and EADS would be issued to the governments of France, Germany and Britain "to replace the existing U.K. government share in BAE Systems and the stakeholder concert party arrangements in EADS."Since BAE Systems' dividend payments to shareholders are traditionally higher, EADS would pay its shareholders more than $322 million to better align the parties' payout ratios but any such payout wouldn't affect the companies' dividend payments for 2012.BAE said that under government regulation both companies are required to announce their intention to proceed or abandon the proposed transaction by Oct. 10. However, BAE said it intends to ask for an extension of the deadline if negotiations with EADS are still occurring at that time.

NEW YORK, June 29 (UPI) -- Police say a New York man arrested for burglary was tracked through DNA left on a carton of orange juice he allegedly drank from and left at the crime scene.James Moorer, 20, was arrested and charged with burglary this week for allegedly breaking into a Chelsea apartment on Christmas Day 2009 and making off with a desktop computer, video and still cameras, the New York Post reported Wednesday.Police arrested Moorer, who has a record of prior arrests, after matching his DNA to the national DNA database.Hanna Cheek, the building superintendent, said the burglar broke in by booting in a basement-window air conditioner. While there he found keys to the first floor home of a couple who were gone for the holidays. Cheek said the intruder "wasn't making any effort to be quiet," and called police when she realized there was a burglary in progress.The burglar ran off when police arrived, but returned later to steal electronic devices from the tenant, Andy Wall."They got some of my stuff, but what was upsetting was the idea of them violating my personal space," Wall said. "It was particularly nerve-wracking because they came back a second time. I don't expect to get anything back."Cheek says she has changed all the building's locks.Moorer was being held in lieu of $15,000 bail.

Medina Garrigues appeared to be in control after winning the first set and moving ahead 5-4 in the second. But Zakopalova held twice around her second break of the day to even the match and dominated the final set to advance.Mona Barthel also broke open a tight match en route to a 7-6 (7-1), 6-0 win over Urszula Radwanska. Each player had three breaks in the first set but Barthel pulled away in the tiebreaker and then posted three more breaks in the second set for the victory.Christina McHale ran to a 6-4, 6-1 win over Pauline Parmentier in the day's final match.

Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, from the waist down, ending the rampage that killed 13 people and wounded more than 30. Munley was shot three times after her gun malfunctioned, testimony at a hearing for Hasan indicated.Both had received widespread praise after the November 2009 shooting, attending a State of the Union address as invited guests of President Barack Obama and being honored as National Law Enforcement Officers of the Year by the American Police Hall of Fame."We all hold Fort Hood in our hearts and never thought we would be facing cutbacks," said Munley, who has taken an unpaid leave of absence.Todd left the Fort Hood police force for an overseas contractor job in July, officials at the base said. He could not be reached for comment but in a Facebook post said: "Thanks for coming out, God bless, goodnight.... I wish everyone good luck and quiet shifts. PS please keep me updated on (Hasan's) court-martial."Military police soldiers will replace civilian officers, Fort Hood officials said.Fort Hood turned to hiring more civilian officers in 2003 as military police officers were being sent to Iraq and Afghanistan, the Statesman said."(Now) as more MP soldiers are available at Fort Hood, we return to the use of MPs for law enforcement," Christopher Zimmer, deputy director for the Directorate of Emergency Services at Fort Hood, said in a statement.

PARIS, Dec. 4 (UPI) -- Employees of a French charity are on trial charged with committing adoption fraud by claiming children from Chad were war orphans from Darfur in Sudan.The trial began Monday, Radio France Internationale reported. Six people associated with L'Arche de Zoe have been charged with trying to arrange French adoptions for 103 Chadian children. Two defendants, Eric Breteau, the group's former chairman, and his partner, Emilie Lelouch, are now living in South Africa and have said they have no plans to come to France. Breteau now operates a guest house, while Lelouch is running a circus, RFI said. Philippe Van Winkelberg, who was the group's doctor, logistics organizer Alain Peligat, Agnes Peleran, a journalist, and Christophe Letien, who prosecutors say functioned as Arche de Zoe treasurer and remained in France, are in the courtroom.Members of the group were convicted in Chad and given prison terms and fines. They were sent to France to serve their sentences and received pardons in 2008 from the president of France. The current trial involves violations of French law. Citane Ferrer, who wanted to adopt one of the supposed Darfur orphans, said she and other potential adoptive parents were told the group hoped to save a total of 1,000 children. Members of the group were arrested in 2007 at an airport in eastern Chad. Police said they had 103 children with them, many of them wearing fake bandages covering supposed war injuries.

Sept. 24 (UPI) -- The two men also struck up a heated debate about homosexuality when the "Piers Morgan Tonight" host asked "Wouldn't it be great for the President of Iran to say, you know something, everyone is entitled to be the sexuality they were born to be?"Speaking through an interpreter, Ahmadinejad responded, "Do you really believe that someone is born homosexual?" When Morgan replied that he "absolutely believed so," Ahmadinejad said:I'm sorry. Let me ask you this. Do you believe that anyone is giving birth through homosexuality? Homosexuality ceases procreation. Who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly, and others do not accept your behavior, that they’re denying your freedom?Morgan also asked the president what he would do if one of his three children were born gay, to which Ahmadinejad said: If a group recognizes an ugly behavior or ugly deed as legitimate, you must not expect other countries or other groups to give it the same recognition.Morgan's full interview with the Iranian president airs Monday night at 9pm. Morgan hinted at the tone of their conversation via tweet:Fair to say that President Ahmadinejad and I locked horns over the Holocaust, gay rights, Syria & Israel. Gets very lively. #CNN 9p,/ET.— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) September 24, 2012

Adam "Pac-Man" Bernard Jones (born September 30, 1983) is an American cornerback and return specialist who is currently playing for the Cincinnati Bengals. He was drafted in the first round with the sixth-overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft by the Tennessee Titans. He played college football at West Virginia.
Jones has also played for the Dallas Cowboys. He was suspended from the NFL for the entire 2007 season and for part of the 2008 season for off-the-field conduct.
Jones was born in Atlanta, Georgia and raised by his mother, Deborah Jones, and his grandmother, Christine Jones; his father was murdered when Jones was four years old. As a child growing up in the Sandtown neighborhood of Atlanta, he was coached by longtime Sandtown coach Gary Jones.
