BEIRUT, Lebanon, Jan. 5 (UPI) -- Lebanon is keen to tap into its domestic gas reserves by reviewing Mediterranean pipeline plans possibly with Russia's help, the country's energy minister said.Russian energy company Stroitransgaz is among the 19 foreign companies investigating a natural gas pipeline along the Mediterranean coast, Russia's news agency ITAR-Tass reports.The $360 million, 108-mile natural gas pipeline would run from northern Lebanon to the port city of Tyre. Gebran Bassil, the country's energy minister, said his country could alleviate many of its energy woes with the pipeline. Lebanon, he said, has a $1.5 billion deficit from fuel purchases.Lebanon is at odds with Israel over who controls the giant Leviathan gas field in the Mediterranean Sea. Observers say Beirut may have to go to the United Nations to get a demarcation to its gas claims within its maritime borders.Beirut says Leviathan extends into its territory and holds about 16 trillion cubic of natural gas and 4.3 billion barrels of oil. Shiite resistance movement Hezbollah has warned Israel to keep its hands off of Lebanon's energy resources.Israel has vowed to retaliate for any attacks on its gas fields and the energy infrastructure that's expected to be developed over the next couple of years.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 11 (UPI) -- Canadian computer scientists say a computer can reconstruct lost languages by analyzing the sounds uttered by those who speak their modern successors.Alexandre Bouchard-Cote at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and colleagues report a machine-learning algorithm can suggest the most likely phonetic changes behind a language's evolution as words mutate and sounds shift.As an example of sound shifting, the researchers cite a recent change known as the Canadian Shift, where many Canadians now say "aboot" instead of "about.""It happens in all words with a similar sound," Bouchard-Cote told NewScientist.com.The researchers used the computer algorithm to analyze thousands of word pairings in 637 Austronesian languages, a language family that includes Fijian, Hawaiian and Tongan.The system was able to suggest how ancestor languages might have sounded and also identify which sounds were most likely to change, they said. The technique could help preserve endangered languages if they are phonetically related to more widely spoken tongues, Bouchard-Cote said.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 (UPI) -- With voters concerned about a faltering economy and the war in Iraq, the possibility of a terrorist attack on American soil has not been at the top of the presidential campaign agenda.And until either Barack Obama or John McCain takes the White House, no one knows whether homeland security and concerns about a domestic attack will be a priority or will fall by the wayside in the face of other issues. "We don't know an attack is inevitable, but we know the risk is high," said Matt Bennett, vice president of Third Way, a politically moderate think tank. "And we know if the response is not smooth, we risk tremendous damage to the U.S. in every possible respect, from increased loss of life to lack of faith in leadership of the new president."Bennett is part of a group of policy experts that has spent the last 10 months researching the possible scenarios of a terror attack in the first year of a new presidency. The Homeland Security Presidential Transition Initiative, a joint project of Third Way and the Center for American Progress, plans to publish a security manual that will be distributed to the candidates before Nov. 4. The manual draws from discussions with a range of security experts, including John Podesta, President Bill Clinton's former chief of staff, and Jamie Gorelick, deputy attorney general under Clinton. These experts believe that, once in office, the new American president must quickly devise an extensive preparedness plan: establish a governmental chain of command, communicate with the public and coordinate mobilization efforts.Based on the content of each candidate's Web site, Obama and McCain have preliminarily pinpointed their top post-election homeland security priorities. Both men outline plans that include supporting first responders, improving border security and protecting infrastructure. "The question is: To what extent are the campaigns already planning for the transition and planning their leadership teams?" said P.J. Crowley, senior fellow at liberal think tank Center for American Progress. "On the one hand, it sounds presumptuous, but on the other hand, it's really important."The experts have been working with history as their guide, claiming terrorists are inclined to strike during new leaders' first terms. This happened in 2001 with 9/11, less than eight months after President George W. Bush took office; Clinton was inaugurated a mere month before the bombing of the World Trade Center garage in 1993; George H.W. Bush was only weeks away from his inauguration when the attack on Pan Am flight 103 happened in 1988; and three days after Great Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown took office in 2007, two terrorists loaded a Jeep with propane canisters and drove it into Glasgow International Airport. So, what would be the strategy behind a first-term strike? In its first year, an administration is still in transition and vulnerable to disruptions. The new president is responsible for nominating a slew of candidates for crucial positions, including members of his cabinet, such as the secretary and undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Without these appointments, lines of authority in a conflict would be unclear and the disorganization could hamstring an administration trying to manage a crisis."Really the question is: How can you accelerate this process?" Crowley said. "How can the next president and his administration get its arms around this thing called homeland security as rapidly and effectively as possible?"Crowley and his colleague at the center, Senior Policy Adviser Michael Signer, are adamant that the next president should retool the way security threats in the United States are assessed. In the experts' opinions, the Bush administration has bungled efforts to communicate with the public on homeland security, from recommendations to stock up on duct tape to the confusing color-coded threat system. The Department of Homeland Security's credibility is waning, they say, and people are tired of messages from the government that raise fears but don't equip them in the event of an attack.Signer suggests the next president should strongly encourage families to formulate their own preparedness plans and involve the public in more long-range strategies like the Freedom from Fear mental health initiative. Going beyond the domestic framework, Stewart Verdery, a former assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security, contributed advice on international relations to the bipartisan preparedness project. Verdery's past experience with Homeland Security convinced him that having a good transition plan "would be integral to a good start next year.""Homeland security is 50/50," said Verdery, a partner with consultancy Monument Policy Group. "It's here, but it's also overseas with information sharing, as well as on the law enforcement side."In spite of some experts' eager contribution to the initiative, concerns about a first-term terrorist attack are not shared by everyone in the nation's capital.James Carafano, senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation, agrees the candidates should already be thinking about their leadership teams and that the White House's readiness for an attack is crucial, but he dismisses the idea of "synchronized" attack timing by terrorists."It's not as if the terrorists are sitting there with some diabolical master plan," Carafano said. "They've been trying to get here, and failed, and they're going to keep trying to get here. But there is not a synchronized date."Still, other security experts say the next president should be on alert in the first 100 days of a new administration."I think it's important for people to understand that we don't necessarily believe anything's going to happen," Crowley said. "But it is important for the new president to come in with this sense of urgency that the more prepared you are to deal with this situation, the better."--MEDILL NEWS SERVICE

NEW YORK, Sept. 26 (UPI) -- The foreign ministers of Japan and China met in New York as each side stuck to its claim to a group of East China Sea Islands amid worsening tensions.Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs Koichiro Gemba, who met with his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, described the meeting's atmosphere as "severe," Kyodo News reported.He said he urged China to exercise restraint over the island dispute, which took on a new dimension after Sept. 11 when the Japanese government nationalized the uninhabited islands, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. It was the first ministerial meeting between Gemba and Yang as bilateral relations have plunged to their lowest level in years, Kyodo said. The issue has triggered widespread and violent protests in Chinese cities and Beijing continues to issue harshly worded statements to assert its claim.The islands, under Japanese control for decades, have assumed importance since recent reports indicated the islands and the waters around them are rich in natural resources. Taiwan also claims the islands.Kyodo quoted Japanese officials that the government's purchase of the islands from a Japanese businessman is intended to manage Senkaku as a peaceful and stable site.China, retaliating against Japan's "illegal" moves, has put off this week's events in Beijing to mark the 40th anniversary of the normalization of bilateral relations. There have been a number of warnings from Beijing, including saying the island issue could affect bilateral trade, estimated at about $340 billion annually.China's official Xinhua news agency quoted Yang as telling Gemba that despite China's stern representations and strong opposition, the Japanese side insisted on implementing the so-called "nationalization," which, Xinhua said, is a violation of China's territorial integrity and sovereignty."The Chinese side will by no means tolerate any unilateral actions by the Japanese side on the Diaoyu Islands. China will continue to take firm measures to safeguard its territorial integrity and sovereignty," Yang said.Xinhua reported both sides promised they would maintain consultations on bilateral relations.On Tuesday in New York, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, after his meeting with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, said Japan will maintain communication with China as both countries are responsible for maintaining peace and stability in the region, Kyodo said, quoting a Japanese official.Separately, Xinhua quoted experts that the dispute has taken a toll on bilateral economic and trade ties.The report said Chinese tourists planning to travel to Japan have been bogged down as major Chinese travel agencies have halted Japan business. It said Japan's major automakers have shut down several factories in China in the wake of the violent anti-Japanese protests.Xinhua said experts estimate the automakers' losses to hit at least $250 million and that the month-on-month sales of Japanese auto products in China could be down 50 percent this month.Beijing retailers told Xinhua that Japanese electronic appliance companies have been hit because of Chinese consumers' boycott of Japanese products."China will lose less than Japan if economic and trade wars have to be our choice ultimately," Mei Xinyu at the International Trade and Economic Cooperation Institution under China's Ministry of Commerce told Xinhua.

MADRID, April 14 (UPI) -- Spaniards decried their king for a costly elephant hunt, which became known only after he broke his hip, after he called for frugality due to the fiscal crisis.Juan Carlos I "is showing a lack of ethics and respect for many people in this country that are suffering a lot," Cayo Lara Moya, federal coordinator of the United Left political coalition, told reporters after the monarch had successful hip-replacement surgery Saturday following a fall during an elephant-hunting trip in Botswana, a country in southern Africa.The 74-year-old king, hunting in the Kalahari Desert, tripped on stairs in the chalet where he was staying, said San Jose Hospital in Madrid, where Juan Carlos had his operation.Sanctioned elephant hunting is allowed to cull herd numbers.Juan Carlos' cost of shooting a single elephant was likely $9,000 to $26,000 on top of travel expenses, Spanish Federation of Hunting President Andres Gutierrez Lara told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph.The king is honorary president of the Spanish branch of the World Wildlife Fund for Nature."King Juan Carlos has lost touch with reality. Or at least so it seems," wrote El Pais columnist Antoni Gutierrez-Rubi, who called the trip "totally inadequate, improper and unjustified.""But the key question is," he asked, "What if he had not fallen? Well, we would not know because the royal family does not report the king's private activities."The palace declined to disclose how the trip was funded.It came several weeks after the king publicly expressed worry over Spain's recessionary economy, which has close to 23 percent unemployment and a record 4.75 million unemployed.He called on all Spaniards to tighten their belts to weather the economic crisis."One of the consequences of the crisis, youth unemployment, gives me sleepless nights," the king told a group of students in Barcelona last month."Talk of tightening every belt [except for those] who is not deprived of their safaris in Botswana," political blogger Koldo Aldai wrote on Facebook.News of the accident broke on a day many Spaniards marked the 81st anniversary of the birth of the Second Spanish Republic.Last week Juan Carlos' 13-year-old grandson, Felipe Juan Froilan, accidentally shot himself in the foot with a shotgun he was not licensed to use during target practice at a family estate north of Madrid.He is still recovering in a Madrid clinic, near where his grandfather is hospitalized.Juan Carlos' son-in-law, Duke Inaki Urdangarin of Palma, Majorca, is separately accused of diverting nearly $8 million in public funds for his own benefit through his non-profit institute for work that was never done or dramatically over-budgeted.When asked by a judge during a February hearing how his 3- and 4-year-old children became partners in the institute, Urdangarin said he loved the idea of a family business, Spain Review reported.In 1956 Juan Carlos, then 18, accidentally shot and killed his 14-year-old brother Alfonso while handling a gun while on vacation in Estoril, Portugal.The king has had eight operations since the 1980s, three of them following accidents while practicing sports.Queen Sofia, who disapproves of hunting, is in Greece for the Orthodox Church Easter.

MOSCOW, May 14 (UPI) -- A U.S. diplomat accused by Russia of being an undercover CIA agent has been ordered to leave the country immediately, Russian officials said Tuesday.Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, said Ryan Fogle, the third secretary in the political section at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, was detained Monday night after he allegedly tried to recruit a member of the Russian intelligence services, The Wall Street Journal reported.The Russian Foreign Ministry said Fogle has been declared persona non grata and demanded his immediate departure from Russia."The U.S. intelligence community recently has made repeated attempts to recruit employees of Russia's law-enforcement bodies and special agencies, which have been recorded and monitored by [Russia's] counterespionage forces," the FSB said in a statement.The Wall Street Journal said the CIA and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow have declined comment.The recruitment note allegedly found in Fogle's possession was released by the FSB and published on the website of the Russian TV channel RT. The New York Times said the letter offered $100,000 as a "down payment" for the Russian agent to "discuss your experience, expertise and cooperation."FSB media officials said the letter was among a number of items confiscated from the agent, including two wigs, three pairs of glasses and several stacks of 500-euro notes.The letter said: "This is a down payment from someone who is very impressed with your professionalism and who would greatly appreciate your cooperation in the future. Your security means a lot to us. This is why we chose this way of contacting you."It was signed, "your friends."Russian officials said Fogle had specialized technical equipment, instructions for the Russian citizen being recruited, a large quantity of cash and the means to change the person's appearance.Fogle was taken to the FSB receiving office where he has been questioned and turned over to U.S. Embassy representatives, RIA Novosti said.

| License Photo	June 6 (UPI) -- The Advertising Standards Authority, an independent British media regulator, banned a Pamela Anderson commercial from the air after four viewers reported it featured offensive content. In the ad, which was made for the web hosting service "Crazy Domains," Anderson plays the head of a meeting in a boardroom full of men, the NY Daily News reported. Despite the fact that the former "Baywatch" star is wearing a suit, a coworker named Adam can't help himself from fantasizing about her. The ad then cuts to Adam's fantasy featuring Anderson and another female co-worker wearing gold bikinis and splashing cream on each other. According to a report by the ASA, Dreamscape Networks -- who owns the web hosting service -- "did not believe the ad objectified women, as it was clear the exaggerated fantasy sequence was limited to Adam's imagination…They believed the majority of viewers would find the ad fanciful and humorous."However, the ASA ruled the spot unfit to run in Britain because it was "likely to cause serious offense to some viewers on the basis that it was sexist and degrading to women.""The ASA understood that the ad was intended as a parody of a mundane business meeting and was intended to be humorous and light-hearted," the report states. "Although the fantasy scene, which we considered was sexually suggestive, was limited to Adam's imagination, we considered it gave the impression that he viewed his female colleagues as sexual objects to be lusted after.”

Wiki
Richard Stephen "Richie" Sambora (born July 11, 1959) is an American rock guitarist, producer, musician, singer/songwriter who is the longtime lead guitarist of the popular rock band Bon Jovi. He and frontman Jon Bon Jovi form the primary songwriting unit of the band. He is also a solo artist, having released two solo albums; Stranger in This Town in 1991, and Undiscovered Soul in 1998. Sambora was listed by Time magazine as one of the best guitarists of all time.
Sambora was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, the son of Joan, a secretary, and Adam, a factory foreman. Sambora is of Polish and Italian descent and was raised Catholic. He grew up in Woodbridge, New Jersey and attended Woodbridge High School there, graduating in 1977. He began playing the guitar at the age of 12 following the death of guitar legend Jimi Hendrix in 1970. From his early days Sambora was strongly influenced by blues and 60s rock 'n' roll. His most important influences were Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Winter, Jimmy Page, Joe Perry and George Harrison. He was also influenced by Spanish classical music and began a life long love of the Spanish guitar. Furthermore, he has stated that psychedelic soul singer Janis Joplin crept into his heart very early in the late 60s and early 70s, having a big influence on his musical style. Classical music directly inspired several of his songs, such as The Answer which was originally written on piano.
Sambora played guitar for and auditioned for big-name bands Kiss and Poison (the latter of which was then named Paris). He was also a guitarist for the band Message, and with that band he gave out a record, which was re-released in 1995 under the name "Message", and in 2000 under the name "Lessons". Bon Jovi added Sambora to replace original lead guitarist Dave Sabo. Sambora went to a show and, after being impressed by Bon Jovi, approached him and informed him that he thought they should work together. They immediately hit it off as friends, and Sambora was invited to a rehearsal. By the time Bon Jovi arrived, the band was sounding better than ever and Sambora was hired on the spot.
