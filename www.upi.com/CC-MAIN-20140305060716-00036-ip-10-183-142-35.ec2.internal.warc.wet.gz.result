CHICAGO, March 23 (UPI) -- Real men not only eat quiche, they apparently cook it too.One of the biggest trends in the U.S. housewares industry is the rise of the so-called "gastro-sexual," said Tom Mirabile, vice president of global trend and design for Lifetime Brands."The old saw about 'can she cook' is being applied to men now," Mirabile said during an interview at the International Housewares Association trade show at McCormick Place in Chicago. "Men are using food to impress women. Celebrity chefs have made it cool."Mirabile said there are six main trends that will drive the industry in the near future. Aside from the rise of the gastro-sexual, manufacturers will have to recognize the needs of each succeeding generation now that baby boomers are heading for their golden years, the importance of the kitchen as the "new living room," the twin importance of going green and the wellness craze, and the recognition we must live within our means."Kitchens are arenas now," Mirabile said. "They're not just functional workspace. Generations X and Y are buying basic-to-good (quality items) to stock their kitchens. Boomers are looking for durability and quality."Companies with multiple brands need to make sure each brand speaks to a generation."Consumers are shifting away from a use-it-and-toss-it mindset to actively fighting planned obsolescence."It's a smaller pie. People want more for their money," he said.That shift to durability also is reflected in increased interest in green cleaning products. Kurt Kober of Clorox' Green Works brand said there's been a marked increase in interest in cleaners made from plant-based materials as opposed to harsh chemicals. The next step will be to convince consumers to buy concentrated products that need to be mixed with water to save on packaging materials.IHA spokeswoman Lisa Casey Weiss said a big trend in housewares these days is the rise of money-saving products, whether in-home steamers like those produced by Haan and Rowenta to reduce the necessity of heading for the dry cleaner to more personal care products to eliminate trips to the salon. Products that do double duty are also big.Weiss said she doesn't expect this trend to fade much once the economy rebounds."Face it. We all like to save money," she said.The drive to meet needs we didn't even know we had brings out the creativity in those bringing products to display at the annual trade show, which is not open to the public.Styled & Simple has come out with Fit & Fold, a system that makes it easier to fold fitted sheets neatly. The product consists of four snaps -- labeled top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right -- that go in a sheet's corners. Just match the snaps and press. They remain on the sheet even through washing but are also easily removed and can be reused.Ever go to a barbecue and ask for a medium-well steak but wind up one rare or well-done? Charmed Life Products wants to help avoid that situation with its Grill Charms. Leslie Heywood said the idea stemmed from an incident at her home where her husband made two kinds of grilled jerk chicken -- one really spicy and one mild. By the time the chicken got to the table, however, no one could tell which was which. So Heywood designed steel charms that can be screwed into a piece of meat.Recipes on the computer are old hat. But what about an iPod-like electronic cookbook? Key Ingredient is producing the Demy -- a touch-screen e-cookbook that can be flipped around in any direction. It comes downloaded with a full range of recipes and cooks can add their own. Not only that but Key Ingredient will take all those little pieces of paper filling up the kitchen junk drawer and scan them in.

ROME, June 18 (UPI) -- Italian energy company Eni said it was coordinating with Venezuelan officials on the progress at one of the largest offshore oil fields in the world.Eni Chief Executive Officer Paolo Scaroni hosted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez at Eni's offices in Rome."During the meeting, which was held in an atmosphere of cordiality, they discussed the progress of the Perla super-giant field project, one of the largest gas fields discovered in the world in recent years, and Junin-5 oil field project," Eni said in a statement Monday.Junin-5 is operated jointly by development companies formed by Venezuela's state energy company Petroleos de Venezuela and Eni. Junin is one of the largest oil fields in the world and Eni said the joint venture was working on the construction of a refinery for the field with a 350,000 barrel capacity.Eni last year agreed to provide as much as $1.5 billion to help Venezuela develop its share of the production phase of Junin 5.The company estimates it will drill around 1,500 wells in the area during its 40-year lifespan. No time frame was unveiled for the refinery.The Perla field holds an estimated 17 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

ASHBURN, Va., Dec. 8 (UPI) -- A 27-year-old Virginia woman was jogging when a passing vehicle hit a deer, sending the animal flying into her, witnesses said. Krystine Rivera of Ashburn was running about 6 p.m. Thursday when a 71-year-old driver hit the animal with her sport utility vehicle, the Washington Post reported.The deer was sent flying into Rivera, who was left with minor injuries and covered with the animal's blood.A witness who saw the accident called 911, the Post said. Rivera suffered a cut to her scalp and a bruise to her right knee. She was released Thursday night after treatment at a local hospital. "My whole right side hurts," she told the Post.The driver was also treated and released.The deer died at the scene. Rivera, who almost didn't go on the run after a bad day at work, said she was 5 miles into her 7-mile journey when the incident occurred. She doesn't remember the deer hitting her. "I was running, then I was on the ground and then was listening to the paramedic. I'm surprised I made it out alive," she said.Rivera said she runs on the path frequently and will still use it despite the accident.

GENEVA, Switzerland, April 26 (UPI) -- A guilty war crimes verdict for former Liberian President Charles Taylor means the days of impunity for "tyrants" is over, the U.N. rights commissioner said.A U.N.-backed war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, convicted Taylor of aiding and abetting in the commission of 11 war crimes or crimes against humanity during overlapping wars in Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone.U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, in a statement Thursday, described the verdict as historic."The days when tyrants and mass murderers could, even when they had been deposed, retire to a life of luxury in another land are over," she said. "And so they should be."The court found Taylor knew of rebel atrocities committed in Sierra Leone during the country's 1991-2002 civil war. He was accused of using so-called blood diamonds to purchase weapons to fuel the rebellion.British Foreign Secretary William Hague called for a residual special court to continue working in order to protect witnesses in the trial, oversee the detention of any suspected convicted at The Hague and protect the archives kept by the Special Court for Sierra Leone.Taylor pleaded innocent. Sentencing is scheduled for May 30.An estimated 50,000 people were killed in the 11-year civil war. Taylor is the first sitting or former head of state to face prosecution by a U.N.-backed war crimes tribunal.

PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 18 (UPI) -- A man charged with throwing a woman on the tracks in a Philadelphia subway station appears mentally unstable, police said. A spokeswoman for the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority said William Clark, who is believed to be 25 to 30 years old, was arrested Thursday, KYW-AM, Philadelphia, reported. The attack late Tuesday afternoon was not publicized and police did not release surveillance camera video until after the arrest. SEPTA Police Chief Thomas Nestel said the man depicted in the video was wearing an unusual jacket and investigators feared he might throw it away if he knew he was a target, the Philadelphia Daily News reported."It was so distinct that we tried to keep the description of that jacket in law-enforcement circles because it was our best lead on clearing this," Nestel said during a news conference. "With our partners in the Philadelphia Police Department, we increased the number of officers out on the platform in our stations and there were many people looking for this person."Police said the man asked the woman for a light and when she obliged grabbed her, hit her several times and then dragged her across the platform. He left with her cellphone. The victim, 23, was able to climb back to the platform. She had only minor injuries. She told KYW she was grateful no train pulled in while she was on the tracks. "I started trying to fight him back as much as I could," she said. "After it was over, the first thing that popped in my head was my son."

Jan. 8 (UPI) -- It looks like constant bickering and political inertia won't win you any love from an exhausted American public. According to Public Policy Polling, only nine percent of voters approve of the way Congress is handling the nation's most pressing issues. So PPP decided to test Congress' favorability against a variety of things Americans tend to disapprove of, from icky bugs to terrible Canadian rock bands. Here's what Americans like more than Congress:1. Lice2. Brussel sprouts3. NFL replacement refsUPI/Nell RedmondLicense photo | Permalink4. Colonoscopies5.

May 16 (UPI) -- Police arrested a pizza delivery man from Brooklyn on multiple counts of sale and possession of a controlled substance Wednesday, after he allegedly dealt cocaine to undercover officers 19 times in the last two years. According to prosecutors, 45-year-old Ramon Rodriguez used his job as a Papa John's delivery man to distribute $45,000 worth of cocaine since 2011. Police finally made the arrest when Rodriguez met undercover officers in the parking of Papa John's restaurant in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Rodriguez allegedly left the restaurant with $27,000 worth of cocaine in an insulated pizza delivery bag, a pizza and a box of Papa's Chicken Poppers, according to PIX-11 New York.

Wiki
Jacob Benjamin "Jake" Gyllenhaal (pronounced /ˈdʒɪlənhɑːl/ JILL-ən-hahl; born December 19, 1980) is an American actor. The son of director Stephen Gyllenhaal and screenwriter Naomi Foner, Gyllenhaal began acting at age ten. He has appeared in diverse roles since his first lead role in 1999's October Sky, followed by the 2001 indie cult hit Donnie Darko, in which he played a psychologically troubled teen and onscreen brother to his real-life sister, actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. In the 2004 science-fiction film The Day After Tomorrow he portrayed a student caught in a cataclysmic global cooling event, alongside Dennis Quaid as his father. He then played against type as a frustrated Marine in Jarhead (2005). The same year, he garnered critical acclaim and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination as Jack Twist in the film Brokeback Mountain opposite Heath Ledger.
Gyllenhaal has promoted various political and social causes. He appeared in Rock the Vote advertising, campaigned for the Democratic Party in the 2004 election, promoted environmental causes, and campaigned on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.
Gyllenhaal was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of film director Stephen Gyllenhaal and film producer and screenwriter Naomi Foner (née Achs). Maggie Gyllenhaal, his sister and also an actress, appeared with Jake in the movie Donnie Darko. Gyllenhaal's father was raised in the Swedenborgian religion and is a descendant of the Swedish noble Gyllenhaal family. His last native Swedish ancestor was his great-great-grandfather, Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal. Jake Gyllenhaal's mother is from a Jewish family from New York City, and Gyllenhaal has said that he considers himself "more Jewish than anything else." On his thirteenth birthday, Gyllenhaal performed a "barmitzvah-like act, without the typical trappings", volunteering at a homeless shelter, because his parents wanted to instill in him a sense of gratitude for his privileged lifestyle. His parents insisted that he have summer jobs to support himself, and he thus worked as a lifeguard and as a busboy at a restaurant operated by a family friend.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
