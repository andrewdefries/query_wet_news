LONDON, Nov. 30 (UPI) -- The British government said at the U.N. climate conference in Qatar that it was working on a holistic plan to curb deforestation.The British Department of Energy and Climate Change states that deforestation may be associated with as much as 17 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. At least 1.2 billion people rely on forests, which are decreasing at a rate of 13 million hectares per year, the DECC said.British Energy Secretary Ed Davey, in a statement, said up to $480 million was available through the International Climate Fund to help curb deforestation."I am setting out plans for working with the private sector and rainforest countries so that the timber and foodstuffs we buy do not cause deforestation," he said.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at a climate conference last year in South Africa that forests are disappearing at an alarming rate despite conservation efforts by some countries.Davey said a more comprehensive approach was needed to reduce activities that lead to deforestation, noting the agricultural sector eclipses the timber industry in terms of forest loss."I am pleased that we are joined by other donor countries in setting out priorities on forests for the U.N. climate conference in Doha and beyond, including on ensuring our respective efforts are coordinated and coherent," he said.

MINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 11 (UPI) -- A $24.9 million follow-on order for new U.S. Marine Corps packs has been given to the Eagle Industries business of Minnesota's ATK company.ATK said the follow-on delivery order comes two weeks after the initial contract was announced.Work for the second order will be performed in Eagle Industries' Puerto Rico manufacturing plants and is expected to be complete Jan. 31, 2013.The two contracts together are valued at $75 million."The new USMC pack system provides Marines with a simple and effective load-carriage system that can easily be customized to support their mission, with or without body armor," said ATK Security and Sporting group President Ron Johnson. "We are honored to have been selected as a key supplier of this mission-critical product and proud of our role in supporting the Marines."The new load-bearing equipment system is designed to allow Marines to carry equipment needed in support of combat operations. ATK said its system maximizes the ability to carry combat loads more efficiently, minimizes the burdens of weight and improves overall system compatibility.

| License Photo	CHELSEA, Mich., Nov. 4 (UPI) -- Jeff Daniels has announced he will again serve as host and perform at a concert celebrating unique Michigan music and homegrown musicians. The actor, singer and songwriter is a Michigan native.The 4th annual "Jeff Daniels & Friends" show is to take place Nov. 28 at Ann Arbor's historic Michigan Theater. This year's lineup of Michigan-bred artists includes an unusual blend of folk, blues and jazz musicians, as well as those expert in the art of the spoken word, Klezmer and world roots music, organizers said. Artists include Lansing's Shout Sister, Shout; Kalamazoo's Red Sea Pedestrian; Ann Arbor's Paul Princen; Chelsea's The Ben Daniels Band; and the Scottville Clown Band.Daniels said his annual Michigan concert was modeled after an event presided over by folk legend Arlo Guthrie."Arlo and friends get together every year around Thanksgiving and take over Carnegie Hall in a huge celebration of folk music," Daniels said in a statement. "I wanted to do something similar to celebrate some of the great artists we have in Michigan. ... We had nearly 2,000 people on their feet singing and dancing in the aisles at last year's show and the shows before that. We've started something big and now have our own fun, festive, unusual, high-energy holiday tradition."

| License Photo	NEW YORK, April 23 (UPI) -- A Dutch non-profit called the Mars One Foundation announced in New York it is taking applications for volunteers willing to take a one-way trip to Mars.The foundation announced at a New York news conference it is planning to send the first group of humans to Mars in 2022, with an aim to land in 2023 and establish the first permanent human settlement on the red planet, CNN reported Tuesday.Bas Lansdorp, chief executive officer of Mars One, said "no new inventions are needed to land humans on Mars" and the largest obstacles facing the mission are financial. However, he said money will be saved by making the trip one-way, as new technologies would have to be developed before a return trip could be made possible.Lasdorp said the idea is for the volunteers to live out the rest of their lives on Mars."It's likely that there will be a crematorium," Lansdorp said. "It's up to the people on Mars to decide what to do with their dead."Grant Anderson of the Paragon Space Development Corp., which manufactures life-support systems and is a partner in the Mars One effort, said some technological obstacles still need to be cleared before the mission can proceed."Questions of reliability and robustness have to be answered before we leave Earth," he said.Lansdorp said anyone over the age of 18 can apply for the mission by submitting a video and a $38 application fee."We are very excited about launching the selection program. Round One is where we open the doors to Mars for everyone on Earth. This is an international mission and it is very important for the project that anyone anywhere can ask themselves: Do I want this? Am I ready for this? If the answer is yes then we want to hear from you," Lansdorp said.

PARIS, Oct. 1 (UPI) -- The European Space Agency says satellite data have helped create flood maps that are available quickly via the Internet for help in responding to disasters.Knowing the extent of a flood -- such as the disasters seen recently in Germany and Central Europe -- and understanding how it might develop is essential for teams responding to an emergency, researchers said.Normally such understanding comes from data from ground and airborne sensors along with historical flood maps hurriedly pieced together, but the method can be overwhelmed by extensive floods and bad weather, they said.Now a collaboration between the ESA and a number of European researcher entities has develop a simple, easy-to-use system that could be available to anyone online, a release from the agency's Paris headquarters said.Near-realtime measurements by radar satellites, including ESA's Sentinel-1 satellite, are processed to create location-specific flood maps and deliver them via the Internet to PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones.The system has been dubbed FAAPS, for Fully Automated Aqua Processing Service."FAAPS is an excellent example of the added value of satellite data made accessible to crisis management teams for aiding rescue operations," the ESA's Olivier Becu said.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 (UPI) -- A grand slam homer in the fourth by Michael Morse put Washington in front Friday and the Nationals held on to defeat the New York Mets 6-4.Washington improved baseball's best record by moving 29 games over .500 with 43 games remaining in the regular season.The Nationals have not had a winning record since moving to Washington from Montreal in 2005 and they need only eight more victories to achieve that feat this year.New York took a 2-0 lead in the first on a two-run single by Daniel Murphy, but Washington struck in a big way in the fourth to go in front for good.Consecutive singles by Jayson Werth, Bryce Harper and Ryan Zimmerman loaded the bases with nobody out and Morse then hit a 1-1 offering from Johan Santana over the wall in right for his 12th homer.Harper added a two-run shot in the fifth to give the Nationals a 6-2 cushion.The win went to Ross Detwiler (7-5), who gave up three runs on six hits in six innings. Tyler Clippard put two runners on in the ninth before escaping with his 26th save.Santana (6-9) allowed all six Washington runs on seven hits in five frames.

MINNEAPOLIS, March 25 (UPI) -- Tubby Smith was fired Monday after six seasons as the men's basketball coach of the Minnesota Golden Gophers.Minnesota was beaten 78-64 Sunday by Florida in their second game of the NCAA Tournament, ending the Gophers' season with a 21-13 record. Minnesota's 83-63 upset win over UCLA Friday was the only NCAA Tournament victory in Smith's tenure.The Gophers got off to a fast start this season, going 15-1 and gaining a Top 10 ranking, but faltered in the second half.Last July, Smith signed a contract extension through the 2016-17 season that includes a $2.5 million buyout clause, but that didn't stop Minnesota from making a change."Tubby has had a long and distinguished career and we feel it's time for a fresh set of eyes for our student-athletes and our program in general," Minnesota Athletic Director Norwood Teague said. "We are grateful to Tubby and his entire staff for their hard work and dedication to this university, our students and the entire Minnesota community."Smith, 61, was 124-81 overall and 46-62 in the Big Ten in six seasons leading the Gophers. Minnesota went to the NCAA Tournament three times in that period but was 1-3 in the tournament.Smith previously coached at Tulsa, Georgia and Kentucky, which won the NCAA title in 1998, Smith's first season. In 22 years as a head coach, Smith has a 511-226 record."I want to thank the University of Minnesota and the people of Minnesota for giving me the opportunity to lead the Golden Gopher basketball program for six years," Smith said. "Our staff did things the right way and will leave knowing that the program is in far better shape than when we arrived. The people of the state of Minnesota embraced Donna [his wife] and me from the beginning and we will always be grateful."

SISSONVILLE, W.Va., Dec. 11 (UPI) -- U.S. officials said they have launched an investigation into a gas line explosion in West Virginia that caused a huge fire and melted part of Interstate 77.The National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday a go-ahead team has been assigned to investigate the natural gas transmission pipeline rupture and subsequent fire in Sissonville, about 10 miles from Charleston.Officials evacuated nearby residents because of fears of another explosion, The Charleston Gazette reported.Kanawha County Fire Coordinator C.W. Sigman said a 20-inch transmission line ruptured, causing the massive fire, and several homes were burned. Emergency officials said there had been no fatalities or serious injuries, the Gazette said."In all my years of experience, this is the biggest fire I've ever seen," Sigman said.Robin Fields of Charleston told the Gazette she was worried for her best friend's husband who lives in a trailer near the explosion, which other friends said was destroyed. At least four families live in trailers near the blast, the report said.Emily McComas, a Gazette copy editor, said she was sitting inside her home at Jenna Landing Apartments when lights began flickering before 1 p.m., the report said."That's when I heard something that sounded like a jet was directly overhead. I thought it was a tornado," McComas said.The blast occurred just before 1 p.m. Crews had shut off one side of the gas pipe by 1:30 p.m., the report said. State officials said one lane of the interstate might be reopened.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, March 26 (UPI) -- Three Republican senators threatened to hold up gun control legislation they said infringes on Americans' Second Amendment rights.Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote a three paragraph letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reed saying they will filibuster any new gun restrictions."The Second Amendment to the Constitution protects citizens' right to self-defense. It speaks to history's lesson that government cannot be in all places at all times, and history's warning about the oppression of a government that tries," they wrote.The pledged to "oppose the motion to proceed to any legislation that will serve as a vehicle for any additional gun restrictions," The Hill said Tuesday.The Obama administration had initially hoped to include an assault weapons ban in the gun legislation by Reed dropped it from the bill, acknowledging it doesn't have the support to pass the Senate.The legislation proposes universal background checks and limits the number of bullets that can be held by a single clip of ammunition, among other changes.

MOSCOW, Aug. 13 (UPI) -- Officials in the Russian republic of Dagestan said they plan to form military units of local residents to fight militants in mountainous areas of the region.Russian President Dmitry Medvedev approved forming a "special unit" of at least 800 people to conduct military operations in the North Caucasus republic, RIA Novosti reported Friday.The republic's first deputy prime minister, Rizvan Kurbanov, said in an interview with Kommersant at least two "ethnic" battalions would be sent to the mountains "to maintain order in the areas where the militants were highly active.""We expect the local personnel to be more effective because, unlike the federal troops, they know all the roads in the mountains and can tell the difference between traditional Islam believers and the extremists even by their appearance," Kurbanov said in the interview.Russia previously formed "ethnic" units Chechnya, another North Caucasus republic, RIA Novosti said.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, May 2 -- President Barack Obama will tell Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto that the U.S. is working on implementing a pact between the U.S. and Mexico that would open up nearly 1.5 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to energy exploration, according to informed sources at the State Department.Obama, who travels to Mexico Thursday, for a series of meetings, said at a news conference this week that “a lot of the focus is going to be on economics” as he meets with Peña. Discussing ways to handle security issues in Mexico, especially the drug cartels, will also be on the agenda.The Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement, which was reached in early 2012, could allow both countries to manage any reservoir that overlaps the border as a “unit,” dividing up production. Two months after the pact was signed by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Mexican government ratified it in April 2012. The U.S. has not yet finalized its legislation as it awaits congressional approval of the agreement. “The U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement is important to expanding America’s offshore energy production, “ said Rep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee. “We know what the potential consequences are if America is blocked from developing its shared natural energy resources along the shared border of U.S. and Mexico.” The House committee had a hearing on its version of the legislation, which is currently in the mark-up phase, and the Senate introduced their bill last week. Energy analyst Joseph Dukert, a longtime specialist in North American energy interdependence, said it was “insulting” for the U.S. not to have moved promptly on the agreement, which he called a “win-win deal”.Oil production makes up 35 to 40 percent of the Mexican budget. The country’s state oil monopoly -- Petroleos Mexicanos, commonly known as PEMEX -- is dropping in crude oil production. This February, crude oil exports from Mexico to the U.S., PEMEX’s largest customer, were only 869 thousand barrels per day (bpd) compared to last year when it was more than a million barrels a day. Pemex would benefit tremendously from opening up more oil development in the Gulf and working with the U.S. on oil production and safe exploration and drilling standards. Pemex’s biggest oil field in the Gulf of Mexico, Cantarell, has seen production slide nearly 74 percent since 2006.“Mexico reached out this slight opening out with PEMEX and we just ignored it,” Dukert said. Besides North Korea, Dukert said Mexico is the only major country that has resisted finding a way to let foreign companies participate in some form of production sharing for oil and gas. If the administration agrees to open the maritime boundary in the Gulf, it may help the U.S. work more closely with its neighbor and continue counting on Mexico as a reliable energy trading partner of oil imports. Canada remains the largest crude oil importer to the U.S., second is Saudia Arabia and third is Mexico, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Erik Milito, a group director at the American Petroleum Institute, which represents more than 400 oil and gas companies, said during his testimony at the House committee hearing, the agreement would “provide legal certainty to U.S. companies, which will encourage them to invest in new energy development, creating jobs and spurring economic growth.” Milito said the U.S. is projected to produce 8 million barrels a day by the end of 2014, but should be doing more. API wants the agreement to be approved “as quickly as possible.”Encouraging more deep-water exploration in the Gulf could also help Mexico put its fiscal house in order and stimulate more balanced economic development. Obama will also travel to Costa Rica this week where he will be meeting with Central American presidents to discuss economic and security issues.
