| License Photo	FORT WORTH, Texas, Feb. 1 (UPI) -- AMR Chief Executive Officer Tom Horton said Wednesday that U.S. carrier American Airlines is aiming for 20 percent in cost reductions across the board.In a memo addressed employees, Horton said, "all work groups will have total costs reduced by 20 percent, including management."The memo did not specify how many job cuts that would entail, but The Wall Street Journal said the airline planned to cut 13,000 positions. "While the savings from each work group will be achieved somewhat differently, each will experience the same percentage reduction," Horton wrote.The airline has targeted a savings of $2 billion in operational costs in a plan that includes an investment of "about $2 billion per year in aircraft, so that by 2017 American's mainline jet fleet will be the youngest in North America." The plan also includes $1 billion per year in "revenue improvements ... through network scale, fleet optimization and product improvements."AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2011. The changes, Horton said, are "a necessity, not a choice."

BISMARCK, N.D., Aug. 6 (UPI) -- The oil boom in North Dakota shows no signs of letting up though there's not much pipeline infrastructure to handle the production, an official said.Oil production in North Dakota has increased every year for the past four years. Much of the production is from the lucrative Bakken formation.Lynn Helms, who directs the mineral resources department in North Dakota, told the Platts news service there was no end in sight for the oil boom North Dakota."We're seeing back-to-back 5 percent increases in production," he said. "And we've got 35,000 wells left to drill in this Bakken reserve."He said it would likely take nearly two decades to develop the play completely. There's not enough pipeline infrastructure, however, to transport Bakken crude to refineries."We're going to need rail (for deliveries) for probably a decade," he said.The Association of American Railroads estimates that around 241,000 rail tankers hauled crude oil and petroleum production during the first six months of 2012, a 38 percent increase from the previous year.Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer told The Washington Post in July that he managed to pressure TransCanada to agree to make concessions for Bakken crude through a so-called on ramp to the Keystone XL pipeline, however. Part of the formation lies in his state.

HOUSTON, July 19 (UPI) -- Oil services company Baker Hughes said Friday onshore drilling in shale reserve areas in the United States was more efficient than ever.Baker Hughes said Friday it launched a quarterly assessment of drilling activity in the United States. Its well count index would provide an assessment of oil and natural gas activity onshore in the United States."In the past couple of years, a number of new technologies have been introduced that are purpose-built for drilling and producing from shale," Baker Hughes Chairman Martin Craighead said in a statement. "When we compare well count and rig count data side-by-side, we can see that efficiencies in the U.S. are improving and that drilling rigs in some basins are drilling wells faster."For the second quarter of the year, Baker Hughes counted 8,800 new wells in service in the United States. More than 3,000 of those new wells came from the Permian and Eagle Ford basins spread across southern states.Overall, however, the company said the number of new wells in the first quarter of 2013 was 8.1 percent less than a year ago but a modest increase from the previous quarter.Baker Hughes said it would publish new well counts on the second Friday of January, April, July and October.

FORT WORTH, Texas, Jan. 26 (UPI) -- Former U.S. Naval Academy cadet Diane Zamora is making what could be her last bid for a new trial in the murder of a Texas teenager seven years ago.Zamora, now 27, spends most of her days locked away in protective custody at a state prison for women, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported Wednesday. Zamora was sentenced to life for the 1998 murder of Adrianne Jones near Fort Worth in a case that drew national attention. Her boyfriend, former Air Force Cadet David Graham, also received a life sentence in the case.In the bid for a new trial, Zamora's attorneys accuse prosecutors of withholding key evidence that supports her claim that she did not help Graham kill Jones.Prosecutors argued in the trials that Zamora was jealous and thought Graham had sex with Jones, who was beaten and then shot after being lured to a remote location.Zamora is only allowed out of her cell for one hour per day for exercise. High-profile inmates are segregated sometimes because other prisoners are jealous, a prison official said.Zamora will not be eligible for parole until September 2036, when she will be 58.

With 63 percent of the state's precincts counted, Romney had 66 percent of the vote to 11 percent for U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas and 10 percent for former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who left the race last month.Romney went into the day's primaries in North Carolina, Indiana and West Virginia with 865 of the 1,144 delegates he needs for the GOP nomination, RealClearPolitics.com said. Paul, the only Republican rival still in the contest, had 93.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 (UPI) -- The bruising fight in Congress over President Obama's Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare -- may spill over into the U.S. Supreme Court where a challenge to the act's contraception mandate is finally on the horizon.The odds are good the justices will rule on the challenge late in the new term, which begins on the first Monday in October.The Obama administration, which filed its own petition to the Supreme Court, says contraception insurance coverage is a basic right for women in the United States, where nearly half of all pregnancies are unplanned. Some business owners say providing contraception coverage violates their consciences and religious rights.Churches, their "integrated auxiliaries," and conventions or associations of houses of worship are exempted from having to provide their employees with the contraception coverage. Religious institutions not affiliated with a house of worship, such as hospitals, charities or schools, are not exempt, but under a compromise offered by the administration do not have to pay for contraceptive coverage. Their insurers have to pay for it.The White House has posted a white paper online breaking down the mandate, which begins Jan. 1:-- Churches and other houses of worship are exempt from the requirement to offer insurance that covers contraception.-- "No individual healthcare provider will be forced to prescribe contraception: The president and this administration have previously and continue to express strong support for existing conscience protections. For example, no Catholic doctor is forced to write a prescription for contraception." -- No one will be forced to buy or use contraception. The regulation applies only to what insurance companies cover. "Under this policy, women who want contraception will have access to it through their insurance without paying a co-pay or deductible."-- "Drugs that cause abortion are not covered by this policy: Drugs like RU486 are not covered by this policy, and nothing about this policy changes the president's firm commitment to maintaining strict limitations on federal funding for abortions. No federal tax dollars are used for elective abortions."The latest petition to reach the high court is from the Obama administration asking for review of a lower-court ruling. The appeals court decision allows Oklahoma City-based owners of for-profit businesses, who say they have moral objections, to reject contraception insurance coverage for their women employees and escape the heavy fines levied for not doing so.The justices tend to grant review when the U.S. solicitor general asks for it.Even more important, there is a split among the U.S. appeals courts on the issue, one of several prime criteria for Supreme Court review. More than 40 suits have been filed so far against the mandate across the country by for-profit businesses whose owners say they can't support contraception.The American Civil Liberties Union, which keeps tabs on the fight, points out two of the three major challenges to the contraception mandate have failed so far.The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Cincinnati rejected a request from a company, which filed suit in Michigan, seeking protections from the mandate. Lawyers for the company said they would ask the Supreme Court for review.The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals headquartered in Philadelphia ruled against a Pennsylvania furniture maker, owned by Mennonites, also seeking such protection. The appeals court said the company challenge was unlikely to succeed.But the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Denver ruled for two Oklahoma companies, Hobby Lobby, an arts supply chain, and Mardel, a Christian bookstore chain. Both companies are secular, for-profit entities."A new government healthcare mandate says that our family business must provide what I believe are abortion-causing drugs as part of our health insurance," Hobby Lobby founder David Green said last year in a opinion piece in USA Today. "Being Christians, we don't pay for drugs that might cause abortions. Which means that we don't cover emergency contraception, the morning-after pill or the week-after pill. We believe doing so might end a life after the moment of conception, something that is contrary to our most important beliefs. It goes against the biblical principles on which we have run this company since Day 1. If we refuse to comply, we could face $1.3 million per day in government fines."The Greens are Baptists.The U.S. Supreme Court last December refused to issue the Greens an emergency stay of the mandate, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who oversees the 10th Circuit, saying the stores don't meet the extremely high standards required for an emergency injunction, but "may continue their challenge to the regulations in the lower courts.""Following a final judgment, they may, if necessary, file a petition" for the Supreme Court to hear the case, she said.The full 10th Circuit earlier heard the case and issued its ruling in favor of the owners."Their owners, the [Green family], run both companies as closely held family businesses and operate them according to a set of Christian principles," the opinion from the appeals court said. "They contend regulations implementing the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act force them to violate their sincerely held religious beliefs. In particular, the plaintiffs brought an action challenging a regulation that requires them, beginning July 1, 2013, to provide certain contraceptive services as a part of their employer-sponsored healthcare plan."The July 1 date has since been postponed by the administration to Jan. 1.Among those services "are drugs and devices that the plaintiffs believe to be abortifacients, the use of which is contrary to their faith," the opinion said.So-called morning after pills are actually taken immediately after intercourse to disrupt fertilization or ovulation."We hold that Hobby Lobby and Mardel are entitled to bring claims under [the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act], have established a likelihood of success that their rights under this statute are substantially burdened by the contraceptive-coverage requirement, and have established an irreparable harm," the appeals court said.A five-judge appeals court majority agreed the businesses were likely to win on the merits, though the judges agreed or disagreed with bits and pieces of the opinion.Earlier this month, the administration filed its own petition to the U.S. Supreme Court asking for review of the Hobby Lobby ruling.The administration petition points out Hobby Lobby actually supplied contraception coverage for its employees until the mandate was issued -- then suddenly reversed itself for Obamacare in a corporate version of "oops.""'[T]he Greens believe that human life begins at conception,' that is, 'when sperm fertilizes an egg,' and they therefore oppose certain contraceptives on the ground that they prevent implantation of a fertilized egg," the administration petition said. "After learning about the contraceptive-coverage requirement, Hobby Lobby 're-examined its insurance policies,' discovered that they already covered certain [Food and Drug Administration]-approved contraceptives to which the Greens objected, and proceeded to exclude those contraceptives from the Hobby Lobby plan."In a rundown of what the Affordable Care Act requires, the administration said Congress was responding "to a legislative record showing that 'women have different health needs than men, and these needs often generate additional costs." Women "'of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket healthcare costs than men.'" And "women often find that co-payments and other cost sharing for important preventive services 'are so high that they avoid getting [the services] in the first place.'"In forming guidelines for the federal act, the Department of Health and Human Services went to the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, "a 'semi-private' organization Congress established 'for the explicit purpose of furnishing advice to the government.'" Among other preventive measures, the institute "recommended coverage for the 'full range' of 'contraceptive methods' approved by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as 'sterilization procedures' and 'patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity,'" the administration said."FDA-approved contraceptive methods include oral contraceptive pills, diaphragms, injections and implants, emergency contraceptive drugs and intrauterine devices. ... In making that recommendation, the Institute noted that nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended and that unintended pregnancies have adverse health consequences for both mothers and children."The administration petition asks the justices to consider the following question: "The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 ... provides that the government 'shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion' unless that burden is the least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental interest. ... The question presented is whether RFRA allows a for-profit corporation to deny its employees the health coverage of contraceptives to which the employees are otherwise entitled by federal law, based on the religious objections of the corporation's owners."In language that probably will be echoed if and when the administration argues the case before the Supreme Court, the petition said the divided opinion in the appeals court "warrants review by this [Supreme] Court. The [appeals] court did not cite [and the government is not aware of] any other decision of this [Supreme] Court or a court of appeals that has ever accepted a claim that RFRA enables a for-profit corporate employer to exempt itself from generally applicable employment regulations."The petition adds: "RFRA provides that the federal government 'shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion' unless application of that burden is 'the least restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest,' and [Hobby Lobby and Mardel's] challenge to the contraceptive-coverage requirement fails to satisfy this statutory standard in multiple respects. First, the for-profit corporate respondents are not 'person[s] exercis[ing] religion' within the meaning of RFRA. ... Second, there is no indication that Congress, in enacting RFRA, intended to disregard fundamental tenets of corporate law that distinguish between the rights and responsibilities of a corporation and those of its owners. Third, the particular burden of which [the companies] complain is too attenuated to be 'substantial.' ... Finally, even if [the companies] could surmount those threshold obstacles, their claim would fail because the contraceptive-coverage requirement is the least restrictive means of advancing compelling governmental interests. ..."The court of appeals erred by deeming the ... corporations to be 'persons' engaged in the 'exercise of religion' within the meaning of RFRA."The administration petition then brought out the big guns, arguing: "The court of appeals held that the religious beliefs of the Greens [which the court imputed to the corporations] trump the rights of the corporations' 13,000 full-time employees and their family members to receive the health coverage to which they are entitled by federal law. The [appeals court] majority found it unremarkable that, under its interpretation of RFRA, for-profit corporations could obtain religious exemptions that come 'at the expense of their employees.'"The majority dismissed that concern by declaring that '[a]ccommodations for religion frequently operate by lifting a burden from the accommodated party and placing it elsewhere.'"

LONDON, June 3 (UPI) -- Talks to allow inspectors inside Iran's nuclear facilities have been "going around in circles," the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Monday.Addressing representatives of the 35 nations on the IAEA board, Yukiya Amano said 10 rounds of fruitless negotiations had been held with Tehran since January 2012, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported."To be frank, for some time now we have been going around in circles," he said."We need to achieve concrete results without further delay to restore international confidence in the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear activities," Amano added.Iran has installed 13,555 centrifuges to enrich uranium inside its largest nuclear plant, the latest IAEA report on Iran's nuclear program found.

Morena Baccarin and Morgan Saylor's roles to be downgraded in fourth season of Showtime drama "Homeland."	Posted By DANIELLE HAYNES, UPI.com | Dec. 15, 2013 at 1:34 PM | 0 comments

| License Photo	Dec. 15 (UPI) -- Morena Baccarin, who plays Jessica Brody on "Homeland," and Morgan Saylor, who plays her daughter Dana, won't return as regulars for the fourth season of the Showtime drama.Though their contracts won't be renewed for the next season of the CIA drama, the two actors will have the option to appear as a guest star, much the same way Diego Klattenhoff, who plays Mike, did during the third season.Increased screen time for Saylor's Dana in season three was a point of friction for fans of the drama, while Baccarin, who was nominated for an best supporting actress Emmy for her role, was almost nonexistent in the latest season. Baccarin was in the third trimester of a pregnancy during much of the third season production and gave birth before filming completed."Because Brody was not onscreen and not part of the story in those first couple of episodes, we really wanted to tell the aftermath of the bombing in a more personal way," "Homeland" showrunner Alex Gansa said of the decision to put more focus on Dana during the third season. "The relationship between Dana and her father is very strong. It's stronger than his relationship with Jessica and certainly stronger than his relationship with [son] Chris [Jackson Pace]."
The third season finale of "Homeland" airs Sunday.[TV Line]
