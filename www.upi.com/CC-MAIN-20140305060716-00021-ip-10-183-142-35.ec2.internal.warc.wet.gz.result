WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 (UPI) -- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the construction of two new nuclear reactors, the first to be built in the United States since 1978.The commission voted 4-1 in favor of the construction and operating license Thursday for Atlanta-based utility giant Southern Co.'s Alvin W. Vogtle plant in Waynesboro, Ga., which already has two reactors dating to the 1980s.With the new reactors, units 3 and 4, it will be the largest nuclear facility in the country.NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko voted against the approval."I simply cannot authorize issuance of these licenses without any binding obligation that these plants will have implemented the lessons learned from the Fukushima accident before they operate," Jaczko said in a written statement explaining his dissent.Jaczko was referring to the nuclear power plant disaster in Japan, in which an earthquake and tsunami caused monumental damage to the Fukushima nuclear facility.Likewise critics of nuclear power said the project poses major risks. A coalition of nine groups including Friends of the Earth and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy said this week they plan to file a lawsuit challenging the decision.U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., Chairman of the Subcommittee on Nuclear Safety, commended NRC's approval, defending the safety of the reactors."These new reactors will employ cutting-edge technology that requires fewer components than our current nuclear fleet, thereby increasing safety by providing fewer opportunities for things to go wrong during an emergency," he said in a statement.NRC in December approved the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor design to be used for the project, which was modified to meet the commission's new and additional requirements, including a steel reinforced concrete structure approximately 3 feet thick protecting the steel containment vessel housing the reactor.Southern says Vogtle 3 could begin operating in 2016 and Vogtle 4 in 2017. Together the reactors will generate 2,200 megawatts, enough to power nearly 1.8 million homes."This is a monumental accomplishment for Southern Co., Georgia Power, our partners and the nuclear industry," said Southern Co. Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas A. Fanning."We are committed to bringing these units online to deliver clean, safe and reliable energy to our customers. The project is on track, and our targets related to cost and schedule are achievable."Construction of the two reactors will cost around $14 billion, and Southern Co. is expected to receive an $8.3 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy.Meanwhile, the utility is already charging customers $3.73 a month for their construction, says Scientific American magazine.Construction of the reactors will involve up to 5,000 jobs, Southern says.The last time the NRC granted approval for a new reactor was in 1978, a year before the Three Mile Island nuclear plant accident in Pennsylvania.

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 30 (UPI) -- The pressure inside a champagne bottle can launch a cork at 50 miles per hour as it leaves the bottle, fast enough to shatter glass, U.S. eye experts say. Dr. Monica L. Monica, an ophthalmologist and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said the speed at which a cork can be unleashed is fast enough to permanently damage vision, including rupture of the eye wall, acute glaucoma, retinal detachment, ocular bleeding, dislocation of the lens and damage to the eye's bone structure. These injuries sometimes require urgent eye surgeries, Monica said. "When a champagne cork flies, you really have no time to react and protect your delicate eyes," Monica said in a statement. The American Academy of Ophthalmology advises to:-- Chill sparkling wine and champagne to 45 degrees F or colder before opening. The cork of a warm bottle is more likely to pop unexpectedly.-- Don't shake the bottle. Shaking increases the speed at which the cork leaves the bottle.-- Point the bottle at a 45-degree angle away from yourself and any bystanders and hold down the cork with the palm of your hand while removing the wire hood on the bottle. -- Place a towel over the entire top of the bottle and grasp the cork. -- Twist the bottle while holding the cork at a 45-degree angle to break the seal. Counter the force of the cork using downward pressure as the cork breaks free from the bottle.

With rebel forces taking an increasingly dominant hold in Gadhafi's stronghold of Tripoli, and his forces abandoning him for the opposition, it looks like the nearly 42 years of his rule in Libya have been brought to an end.

SIMRISHAMN, Sweden, July 10 (UPI) -- A Swedish hot dog vender has caused outrage with an advertisement featuring a woman's lips wrapped around a "thick sausage."The kiosk, located at a city-run sports hall in Simrishamn, bears a sign advertising "thick sausage with bread" underneath an image of a woman gripping a sausage with both hands and wrapping her lips around it, the Swedish news agency TT reported Tuesday."This is a sexualized picture. A prime example of an poorly-thought through act and a traditional gender approach with the aim of drawing in customers," gender studies expert Britten Dehlin told the Swedish-language Ystads Allehanda newspaper.Dehlin said the hot dog stand previously bore an advertisement depicting a naked woman wrapped around a sausage. She said the kiosk's advertisements give the wrong impression about gender equality in the city."We want people to come here, we want Simrishamn to have a good reputation and take the lead with our gender equality work. This is not just behind the times, but it's working against equality," she said.Jorgen Andersson, owner of the kiosk, said he does not see anything wrong with the image."I think the picture's fun! The youngsters don't get it -- they only see the sausage," he said.Andersson said the image was previously used by Swedish food retailer Scan.A member of the local council, which leases the space to the kiosk, said he has not seen the advertisement but plans to have it removed.

LUBBOCK, Texas, June 4 (UPI) -- Newly elected West Texas Congressman Randy Neugebauer packed his bags Wednesday for Washington.Neugebauer defeated Mike Conaway in Tuesday's runoff between two Republicans to succeed retiring Rep. Larry Combest. Neugebauer won by a slim 1.2 percent but Conaway said he would not seek a recount."It's very humbling to have come out on top," said Neugebauer, who plans to leave Wednesday or Thursday for his new career in Washington.Combest's retirement, announced a few days after the Republican easily won re-election last November, was a shocker for District 19 where he had served since 1985. The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee said he wanted more time with his family.Gov. Rick Perry called a special election and 17 candidates entered the race. Neugebauer and Conaway received the most votes and went on to the runoff race to determine Combest's successor.Neugebauer, 53, will take over Combest's seats on the agriculture and small business committees and complete Combest's term, which expires at the end of 2004. Neugebauer has not decided if he will run for a full, two-year term next year.

WASHINGTON, April 30 (UPI) -- The U.S. Supreme Court Monday opened the gates for former Illinois Gov. George Ryan to challenge his mail fraud conviction.Ryan, 78, is serving 6 1/2 years for racketeering, conspiracy, tax fraud and lying to the FBI.The Supreme Court, in a short order, told the lower court to hear Ryan's appeal "in light of Wood vs. Milyard."In that ruling last week, the high court said a court cannot deny constitutional review based on issues prosecutors did not raise -- for example, if a defendant had waited too long to appeal.Ryan's second appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago said jury instructions and evidentiary rulings were not allowed under Supreme Court precedent, the Courthouse News Service reported.Those errors allowed the jury to convict him on a denial of honest-services theory without separately finding a bribe or kickback, Ryan's lawyers argued.But the appeals court disagreed, Courthouse News reported. "Jury instructions that misstate the elements of an offense are not themselves a ground of collateral relief; likewise with erroneous evidentiary rulings," Chief Judge Frank Easterbrook said.Ryan was convicted in 2006 of awarding state contracts to friends and donors while he was secretary of state and governor in exchange for money and gifts, Courthouse News said.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, July 19 (UPI) -- Backers of sweeping U.S. immigration reform must get much better at influencing House Republicans or the reform may not come to pass, Sen. John McCain said."Here's the fact: We're not winning, so we've got to wage a campaign," the Arizona Republican told reporters."That doesn't mean a negative campaign. It means a positive campaign," he said."There are many members of the House that don't want to take up any bill at all, as you know," McCain said. "What our job is, we want to convince them to at least pass legislation, so that we can go to conference and work together."McCain -- a member of the bipartisan "Gang of Eight" who wrote and negotiated an immigration-reform bill that passed the Senate 68-32 June 27 -- said supporters, including business, religious, labor and other groups, would use the August congressional recess to campaign in some 100 battleground districts for comprehensive immigration reform.Spiritual leaders, police officers and business owners are expected to make the conservative case for immigration reform at town hall meetings, reported Politico, which interviewed McCain separately.There will also be protests aimed at Republican leaders, Politico said.All aspects of the campaign will seek to convince House Republicans they have no option but to pass broad immigration legislation.President Obama spent part of an Oval Office meeting last week with McCain and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., another key Gang of Eight member, pressing them on the August-break strategy, Politico said.House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said the House will not consider the Senate bill, which he has called "flawed legislation rushed through the Senate."House Republicans have united around a piecemeal approach."House committees will continue their work on a step-by-step, common-sense approach to fixing what has long been a broken system," Boehner said.More than 90 Catholic college presidents sent letters to all Catholic House members, including Boehner, Wednesday urging them to support a comprehensive immigration bill."We hope that as you face intense political pressure from powerful interest groups, you will draw wisdom and moral courage from our shared faith tradition," said the letter, also signed by 60 prominent theologians and two former U.S. ambassadors to the Vatican."Catholic teaching values the human dignity and worth of all immigrants, regardless of legal status," they wrote. "We remind you that no human being made in the image of God is illegal."

PYONGYANG, North Korea, March 8 (UPI) -- North Korea said Friday it will snap its hotline and scrap all non-aggression pacts with South Korea even as its leader Kim Jong Un threatened all-out war.With the North's belligerence growing over the latest ratcheting up of U.N. sanctions over its Feb. 12 underground nuclear test, the country's official Korean Central News Agency quoted the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea as saying: "The DPRK [or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the official name of North Korea] abrogates all agreements on non-aggressions reached between the North and the South."South Korea's Yonhap News Agency described the committee as a propaganda outfit against Seoul."The DPRK will close the Panmunjom liaison channel between the North and the South [the main border crossing point]," the committee said.The report said South Korea also would be informed about the North's decision to immediately cut off the North-South hotline.The North already has said it would scrap the 1953 armistice agreement that ended the 1950-1953 Korean War.Separately, Kim Jong Un, who took over as North Korea's leader after the death of his father in December 2011, said his military was ready to fight an all-out war, China's Xinhua News Agency reported, quoting the KCNA."All the service personnel of the ground, naval, air and anti-air and strategic rocket forces are fully ready to fight a Korean style all-out war," the leader said while inspecting a front-line army unit stationed on two southwestern islands.Kim warned he would "issue an order to start the just great advance for national reunification" if "the enemy makes any slight reckless provocation against the DPRK."The threat to scrap the 1953 armistice agreement came as the United States-South Korea planned their "Key Resolve" military exercise. North Korea has said the exercise is a prelude to an invasion.The tour by Kim, who is also the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, was to the military units responsible for the November 23, 2010 shelling of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island in which four people died and 16 were wounded.He was quoted as saying the artillery attack annihilated South Korean warmongers' efforts to provoke the North, Yonhap reported.Other recent threats from the North have included preemptive nuclear strikes against its "aggressors" and turn them into a "sea of fire."The unanimously approved U.N. Security Resolution 2094 comes in the wake of its January action, tightening its sanctions over the North's earlier two nuclear tests in 2003 and 2006, its missile tests and its long-range rocket firing last December. Resolution 2094 came after Untied States reached a deal with China, which is North Korea's closest ally.

| License Photo	Aug. 2 (UPI) -- Kate Hudson revealed she had a connection to the British royal family during an appearance on Wednesday's "Tonight Show" with Jay Leno. "Prince William and Prince Harry actually stayed at our house in Colorado when they were kids," Hudson told the host. "We were all in L.A. and they were staying with their mom at the time and we get this phone call at the house."The "Bride Wars" star goes on to say that "sure enough, I think it was Prince William calling my dad [Bill Hudson] to ask if he could use the ATVs, the four-wheeler things." Upon hanging up, "My dad goes, 'That's a really well-raised boy.' It was pretty cool."Though the 34-year-old actress has not met the royal family herself, she said she had been keeping up with the news regarding Prince William's and Kate Middleton's newborn son, George."You can't help but follow it," said Hudson, who was in London at the time of the royal birth. "It's on every news channel. That's all you saw."

Wiki
Thaksin Shinawatra (Thai pronunciation: ; born 26 July 1949) is a Thai businessman and politician, who was Prime Minister of Thailand from 2001 to 2006, when he was overthrown in a military coup.
Thaksin founded Advanced Info Service, Thailand's most successful mobile phone operator, and became a billionaire. Thaksin entered politics in 1994 under Phalang Dharma Party, left the party along with many of its MPs in 1996, and founded the populist Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party in 1998. After a historic election victory in 2001, he became prime minister, the country's first to serve a full term. Thaksin introduced a range of policies to alleviate rural poverty; highly popular, they helped reduce poverty by half in four years. He launched the country's first universal healthcare program, the 30-baht scheme, as well as a highly popular drug suppression campaign. Thaksin embarked on a massive program of infrastructure investment, including roads, public transit, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Nevertheless, public sector debt fell from 57% of GDP in January 2001 to 41% in September 2006. Levels of corruption were perceived to have fallen, with Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index improving from 3.2 to 3.8 between 2001 and 2005. The Thai Rak Thai party won an unprecedented landslide in the 2005 general election, which had the highest voter turnout in Thai history.
The Shinawatra government faced allegations of corruption, authoritarianism, treason, conflicts of interest, acting non-diplomatically, and muzzling of the press. Thaksin was accused of tax evasion, lèse majesté (insulting King Bhumibol, and selling assets of Thai companies to international investors. Independent bodies, including Amnesty International, criticized Thaksin's human rights record. Thaksin was also pressed charged for concealing his wealth during his premier.
