MIAMI, Aug. 16 (UPI) -- Oil companies working in the Gulf of Mexico are bracing for Tropical Storm Erin, which the National Hurricane Center said Friday was strengthening.Marathon Oil said it evacuated non-essential workers from a platform about 130 miles off the coast of Louisiana. British energy company BP said four of its oil and natural gas installations in the area were affected as well, Upstream Online reported Thursday.Hurricane Isaac, which struck the southern Gulf Coast area last summer, and Hurricane Sandy, an October storm that battered the East Coast, caused regional spikes in gasoline prices because of their impacts on the energy industry.Mexican energy company Pemex and Shell said they were monitoring the storm as it approaches, Upstream said.The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Erin was about 430 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands. The storm was moving west-northwest at about 16 miles per hour Friday."Some slow strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours," it said.

SINGAPORE, Feb. 6 (UPI) -- Singapore's Interra Resources Ltd. said it started drilling into the Yenangyaung oil field in Myanmar, near sites known to produce oil.Interra said by working through a partnership with the Goldpetrol Joint Operating Co. Inc., it started drilling a development well designated as YNG 3265.The company said in a statement Wednesday the primary objective of the well is to accelerate production from oil reservoirs from adjacent wells, "of which eight have been completed as oil producers in 2012 and 2013."It gave no indication of the reserve potential at the Yenangyaung oil field but the U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude oil production in Myanmar is "minimal" though increasing. Myanmar is a net oil importer.Interra said it would announce the results of the well after drilling operations are completed in about six weeks.Human rights groups have expressed concern about the corporate interest in Myanmar given its human rights record. Sanctions on Myanmar eased when military rule ended in 2010, though rights groups say it was those sanctions that encouraged reform.

Henry Stevens said. "Launching signifies a ship is ready to enter into the final phase of construction, including test and activation of major equipment such as the propulsion plant."JHSVs transport 600 tons for 1,200 nautical miles at an average speed of 35 knots and operate in shallow-draft ports and waters. They also feature a flight deck.Berthing on the ships are for 104 personnel with airline-style seating for as many as 312 people. Austral said a fourth JHSV is under construction at the shipyard.Austal delivered the first of 10 JHSVs to the Navy in December of last year.

READING, England, Dec. 14 (UPI) -- Drivers on the M4 highway on the outskirts of Reading, England, were surprised to spot a sign requesting a divorce "for Xmas."Motorists said the mysterious banner, hand-painted in red and black on a white sheet, was first spotted early Tuesday, the Daily Mail reported."For Xmas Dan Jude wants a divorce," the sign reads.With the names "Dan" and "Jude" on different lines with no comma separating them, the mystery is who, exactly, wants a divorce.Is it "Dan Jude" or is it someone named "Jude" breaking up with "Dan"?Of course, it's also possible a third party is making the announcement for either "Dan Jude" or "Jude."

Reeling Montana Senate candidate back in raceRepublican Mike Taylor is back in the race for a Senate seat from Montana.After suspending his campaign over a smarmy commercial that featured a film clip from his days as a leisure suit-clad hairdresser in the 1970s, Taylor announced Tuesday that he would again actively try to win the Nov. 5 race against incumbent Democrat Max Baucus."What would my forefathers do -- those salt of the earth people who settled the West? Would they just walk away? No way," Taylor said. "After conferring with my wife, my children, my family, the decision was made that I must come back -- not just because I want to be a senator, but because I want to make a statement about decency."Taylor was trailing in the polls when he shelved his campaign Oct. 10 after the ad hit the airwaves. The commercial, which showed a blow-dried Taylor applying a facial to a male customer with dated disco music playing in the background, was seen by many analysts as a not-too-subtle attempt to convince Montana's conservative voters that the married Taylor was gay.Taylor had called for a write-in candidate to take up the Republican flag, however, he said Tuesday that long sessions of prayer had persuaded him to get back into the game under the banner "Countdown to Decency.""I want to save democracy from the smear campaigns," he declared. "I realize that our effort is David vs. Goliath -- the people vs. the muckrakers. They (the Democrats) may have 10 times more money than we do, but Montanans have 10 times more integrity than them."Poll: Gov. Jeb Bush has edgeA new Mason-Dixon poll of 638 probable Florida voters released Tuesday showed Gov. Jeb Bush with a 5 percentage point lead over scrappy lawyer Bill McBride, his Democratic challenger in the race for governor.The poll gives Bush 49 percent of the vote to 44 percent for McBride, with 6 percent undecided. It also said most of the undecided are Republicans. The margin of error was 4 percent. A Mason-Dixon poll taken a month ago showed Bush with a 6 percent margin.Bush's mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, campaigned with the governor at a retirement community in southwest Florida Monday and former President George H.W. Bush was to appear at a Jacksonville rally Tuesday."This still is a very competitive race," said Brad Coker, managing director of Mason-Dixon Polling and Research. Other polls earlier this month have shown the contest as being a little tighter than that. "I think we're in pretty good shape two weeks out, but we've got a lot of work to do," Bush said. McBride's campaign manager Alan Stonecipher had a different view."If anyone's moving, it's us," he said. The two candidates were scheduled to hold their third and final debate Tuesday night.Lautenberg widens leadThe latest poll on the New Jersey Senate race shows Democrat Frank Lautenberg extending his early lead over Republican Douglas Forrester to 8 points. The Newark Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll of 800 likely voters taken from Oct. 13-17 found Lautenberg, a former U.S. senator plucked out of retirement to replace Sen. Bob Torricelli on Oct. 1, leading Forrester, 47 percent to 39 percent.Lautenberg had a 6 percent lead in a survey released Oct. 11.Much of Lautenberg's strength is among women, the poll showed. The Democrat had a 21 percent lead among women -- 53 percent to 32 percent -- and a 9 percent edge with independents. Forrester led among likely men voters 47 percent to 39 percent.Torricelli was behind by 13 points in an Eagleton poll released two days before he withdrew after being cited for ethics questions by a Senate committee.Napolitano leads in pollsArizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano leads Republican Matt Salmon in the race for governor in two statewide polls.A Rocky Mountain Poll of 662 voters conducted this week gave Napolitano a 16-point lead, up from 3 percent last week. A poll by KAET-TV/Channel 8 in Phoenix gave the Democrat an 8-point edge, 46 percent to 38 percent. The polls each had a margin of error of 5.2 points.Pollsters said Napolitano is winning the support of female voters, 2-1.Missouri Senate candidates agree on tax cutsDemocratic and Republican Senate candidates in Missouri faced off in their first and only face-to-face televised debate in St. Louis Monday night with polls showing them locked in a statistical dead heat.Democratic Sen. Jean Carnahan, who took the post two years ago after her husband, Gov. Mel Carnahan, was elected posthumously, argued in favor of a middle-class tax cut.Republican Jim Talent, a former four-term congressman, said he favored new tax cuts to stimulate the economy, even though the federal budget deficit is growing.A new poll by KSDK-TV showed Carnahan with 50 percent, Talent 47 percent with 3 percent undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 4.2 percent.Talent stressed his Washington experience over and over, mentioning his service in the U.S. House 19 times in the hour. The debate was Carnahan's first.The winner of the special election will serve a four-year term.Texans begin absentee votingEarly voting started this week in Texas and both candidates in the hot governors' race have already cast their ballots.In his hometown of Laredo, Democrat Tony Sanchez and his wife, Tani, cast their ballots at Cigarroa High School Monday."We have 15 days to go until the general election, and I feel real good," Sanchez said. "Our field operations are kicking into high gear right now across the state. Everybody is very excited. ... I think we're going to have a massive turnout in this election."Sanchez, who would be the first Hispanic governor of Texas, is hoping to draw a record number of Hispanic voters to the polls in early voting or on Nov. 5.In Austin, Republican Gov. Rick Perry, voted at a senior citizens' home Monday, using the photo opportunity to criticize Sanchez's record of not voting."The key today is just to bring attention to people to go vote. It's a great privilege. It's a right that Texans need to exercise. In fact, I congratulate Mr. Sanchez on voting for the first time in eight years," he said.Sanchez, a millionaire oilman and banker, has apologized for not voting in several recent elections. He is running for public office for the first time, while Perry has been a fixture in Texas politics for nearly 18 years, succeeding George W. Bush as governor.In-person, early voting began this week across Texas and will end on Nov. 1.More than 12.8 million people have registered to vote in the Texas general election, an increase of nearly 450,000 from the 2000 presidential election, according to the secretary of state's office. Of the total, about 19.7 percent have Hispanic surnames, the office says.Vote (absentee) early and often ...Election officials in Colorado are blaming a faulty addressing machine at a private vendor for mailing duplicate absentee ballots to about 200 Denver households. Officials began receiving calls from confused citizens on Friday after the election commission put about 56,000 absentee ballots in the mail.Another 200 voters in north-central Denver will be mailed a corrected ballot. The first ballot left off the candidates in House District 5.Commission Executive Director Robert Mendoza, who took office earlier this month, called the mistakes "unfortunate" but said he's confident the election will run smoothly.The ballots have a computerized bar code and duplicates would be disqualified, an election commission official told Tuesday's Denver Post.In Nebraska, with a smaller than usual turnout likely at the polls Nov. 5, absentee ballots could play a major role in deciding political races.Twelve percent of the ballots counted in the 2000 election were cast early under the state's no-excuse absentee voting, which does not require voters to give any reason why they can't get to the polls on Election Day.Absentee ballots can be cast at county offices or by mail by Nov. 4.Previously voters had to state they had a health problem or were jailed on a misdemeanor to qualify to vote absentee.State Democratic and Republican leaders told WOWT-Channel 6 in Omaha both parties are courting registered voters who missed the primary to make sure they vote this time around.Heston stumps for gun rightsOscar-winning actor Charlton Heston kicked off a 12-state tour in New Hampshire Monday night campaigning for candidates who support the right to bear firearms.He admitted, however, he didn't know the names of any of the local candidates on the ballot, according to the Union Leader of Manchester.The only thing that interested the president of the National Rifle Association were candidates who oppose gun control laws.At an NRA rally in Manchester, Heston, 78, told the audience: "It's not only important that you vote, but who you vote for."Heston, who recently announced he has Alzheimer's disease, ended his remarks by raising an antique rifle over his head and proclaiming, as he has before, "From my cold dead hands."A group of about 30 protested outside, criticizing Heston and the NRA for blocking "common sense measures" to reduce gun violence and for failing to promote gun responsibility.Madame governorGov. Jesse Ventura clearly will be an outspoken maverick until the end of his term in January.The former professional wrestler-turned-politician, who is not running for re-election, Monday told reporters he is considering leaving office a few days early so Minnesota can have its first woman governor, Lt. Gov. Mae Schunk."I just thought it would be fun, the last week, to leave early and make Mae the first female governor of the state," he said.Schunk says she'll pass on the honor. She said the state's first woman governor should be elected by the people. Ventura supports Independent Party candidate Tim Penny in the Nov. 5 election.During Monday night's gubernatorial debate the four candidates were asked to sum up Ventura's single term. Penny said it was "quite a ride." Republican Tim Pawlenty called it "loud," Democrat Roger Moe said it "was a lost opportunity" and Green Party candidate Ken Pentel credited Ventura for breaking "the two party dominance" in Minnesota politics. (Les Kjos in Miami, Phil Magers in Dallas and Dave Haskell in Boston contributed to this report.)

| License Photo	June 25 (UPI) -- "Knock knock." "Who's there?" "George Zimmerman." "George Zimmerman who?" "All right, good, you're on the jury!"That thud you're hearing was this joke, attorney Don West's idea for how to start his opening statement in the defense of George Zimmerman, falling completely flat.When the jury stared back at him, silent, West covered for his ill-timed attempted at humor."Sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying," he explained. "“The young man lost his life. Another is fighting for his. The evidence will show this is a sad case; no monsters here."But West's explanation didn't seem to fly. Criticism poured in, from local media and other lawyers."Just spit-balling here, but let's say you're one of the jurors who has to decide this case," wrote Joe Henderson of the Tampa Tribune. "This may be the most serious thing you'll ever be asked to do.""All we know for sure right now is that Martin died from a bullet fired from Zimmerman's gun, and the defense began its case with a juvenile joke," he wrote. "If I'm on that jury, I'm scribbling "idiot" on my note pad.And Jose Baez, the attorney who represented Casey Anthony in another high-profile Florida murder trial, said West's decision was in extremely poor taste."It showed tremendous insensitivity in starting out with a joke, especially a bad one," Baez said, whereas the prosecution's use of profanity "perks up the jurors" and "grabs their attention."But legal analyst Mark NeJame said West has time to make up for his stumble at the start."Although we're holding on to every word, and we're all talking about knock-knock jokes...rare is it that any case is linear," NeJames said. "There will be good days for the state and good days for the defense."And at the very least, if there was any doubt the trial of Zimmerman, who has been charged with the second-degree murder of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, both legal teams have thoroughly dispelled that notion.

BHUBANESWAR, India, June 1 (UPI) -- A tiger was on the loose in India's Odisha state Saturday, the day after it scaled an 18-foot-high fence to escape from a zoo, officials said.The 6-year-old male tiger, which had been at the Nandankanan Zoo in Bhubaneswar since April 28, got out Friday night after being moved to an enclosure from the tiger safari, J.D. Sharma, the principal chief conservator of forest wildlife, told the Press Trust of India."The tiger escaped from the enclosure after jumping over the 18-feet-high wire fencing," Forest and Environment Minister Bijayshree Routray said. "His pug marks are clearly visible on the walls of the enclosureRoutray said the big cat ran off into a nearby forest."We are sure to locate the tiger soon. It is not a man-eater or has ever attacked a domestic animal while coming to the Nandankan Zoo on its own," he said.Zoo officials closed the tiger safari indefinitely as a result of the escape.

| License Photo	May 15 (UPI) -- Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mark Jeffries made several comments in a 2006 article for Salon that are coming back to haunt him -- in the form of protests and even viral videos advocating for "brand readjustment." Actress Kirstie Alley, who starred in the 2005 Showtime series "Fat Actress," denounced Jeffries comments in an interview with Entertainment Tonight, saying that her children are not allowed to shop there."He said Abercrombie clothes are for people who are cool and look a certain way and are beautiful and are thin' and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah," Alley said. "That would make me never buy anything from Abercrombie.""I’ve got two kids in that bracket," Alley said of her sons William True Stevenson, 20, and Lillie Price Stevenson, 18. "But they will never walk in those doors because of his view of people -- forget women, his view of just people.”Alley also addressed the controversy on her Twitter feed: "I don't care if A&F sells above size 10," she wrote. "The point is their CEO took a stand against the "coolness" of "above size 10 kids" #standdownCEO"In the interview, Jeffries claimed that his company only wanted "good-looking" "cool and popular kids" shopping at Abercrombie and Fitch stores. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely. Those companies that are in trouble are trying to target everybody: young, old, fat, skinny. But then you become totally vanilla. You don’t alienate anybody, but you don’t excite anybody, either.”

John Henry "Doc" Holliday (August 14, 1851 – November 8, 1887) was an American gambler, gunfighter and dentist of the American Old West, who is usually remembered for his friendship with Wyatt Earp and his involvement in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.
"Doc" Holliday was born in Griffin, Georgia, to Henry Burroughs Holliday and Alice Jane Holliday (née McKey). His father served in the Mexican–American War and the Civil War. His family baptized him at the First Presbyterian Church in 1852.
In 1864 his family moved to Valdosta, Georgia. Holliday's mother died of tuberculosis on September 16, 1866, when he was 15 years old. Three months later his father married Rachel Martin. While in Valdosta, he attended the Valdosta Institute, where he received a strong classical secondary education in rhetoric, grammar, mathematics, history, and languages – principally Latin, but also French and some Ancient Greek.
