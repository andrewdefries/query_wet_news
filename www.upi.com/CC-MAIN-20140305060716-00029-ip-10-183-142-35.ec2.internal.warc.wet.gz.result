JOLIET, Ill., Aug. 18 (UPI) -- Machinists at a Caterpillar Inc. plant in Illinois are set to return to work after a strike that lasted for more than three months, company officials say.Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at the plant in Joliet approved the contract Friday, the Chicago Tribune reported. The company more than tripled a ratification bonus to $3,100 before the vote.Union members said the contract -- which freezes pay for those hired before 2005, doubles health-insurance premiums and reduces the benefits of seniority -- passed by a narrow margin. Many of those who voted against it were angry."I can't believe they did this," a tearful Vickey Pogliano said. "I'm shocked. I know there is a lot of people hurting but they didn't see the big picture."About 780 employees struck May 1, although 100 had returned to work, union members said. The company said strikers will be brought back over about two weeks beginning Monday.

ORLANDO, Fla., Aug. 29 (UPI) -- The U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin are assessing possible integration of a cooled tri-mode seeker onto weapon platforms.The collaboration comes under a five-year cooperative research and development agreement from the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate."We will work closely with Lockheed Martin to leverage their mature seeker technology with some of our novel in-house targeting concepts," said Buddy Goldsmith, chief of the U.S. Air Force's Weapon Seeker Sciences Branch and Seeker Phenomenology Evaluation and Research facility.Lockheed Martin and AFRL will assess tri-mode weapon capabilities, emerging targeting concepts and guidance techniques. Data and analysis from the effort will enable AFRL to develop a baseline for integrating seekers onto future Air Force weapon platforms intended to engage stationary and mobile targets in day, night and adverse weather conditions.Lockheed's cooled tri-mode seeker is based on three combat-proven weapon systems: Javelin, Longbow and Hellfire. The first-generation, tri-mode seeker was developed in 2001 for the Common Missile program; later generations were developed for the Small Diameter Bomb II and other weapon systems.The seeker, in its fourth generation, has undergone thousands of hours of laboratory, tower and captive-carry tests and has been proven in dirty battlefield testing and in guided flight.The tri-mode seeker combines a semi-active laser sensor, an imaging infrared sensor and a millimeter wave radar into a single seeker with a common aperture.The cooled I2R sensor provides passive detection and lock-on-before-launch from substantial standoff ranges, significantly increasing warfighter survivability.All three sensor modes run simultaneously and share information in flight, allowing warfighters to defeat moving and stationary targets.

NEW YORK, June 20 (UPI) -- Working on a film set 50 years in the future has actor Tom Cruise thinking about what kinds of technological advances he would like to see in the next few decades."I like the transportation system (created for the film 'Minority Report')," Cruise told a roomful of reporters in New York recently. "A stun gun would be kind of interesting. A sick stick to have around every now and then would be good. The retinal scanning. If you look at where that's going, it's certainly going to help us in terms of preventing crime. I was reading the other day on the Internet that there's this scientist who developed a program that could predict human behavior."I think they're going to test it in airports, but it's basically to spot terrorists and it's all done on computer. I'd like a system in place that would prevent crimes, prevent terrorism, certainly, but when you look at the freedoms you'll have to give up, that is something that I think people should be more aware of, the ramifications of that. "Wires in the eyes. They numbed my eyes. (Director) Steven (Spielberg) was very nervous and wanted to shoot that as quickly as possible. It was wild. It didn't hurt because my eyes were numb, but it was a little uncomfortable afterwards. But I liked how it looked," he explained, confirming the "wires in the eyes" thing was a nod to filmmaker Stanley Kubrick of "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange" fame. In "Minority Report," Cruise plays John Anderton, head of the Justice Department's elite Pre-Crime Unit, which catches and punishes people before they commit crimes, based on the predictions of a trio of psychic beings known as Pre-Cogs. Problems arise when the Pre-Cogs foretell that Anderton will murder a complete stranger in less than 36 hours. Now, with his own unit, led by his rival Danny Witwer (played by Colin Farrell,) tracking his every move, Anderton must dodge the very system he helped create and prove the Pre-Cogs wrong.Asked what initially drew him to the project, the three-time Oscar nominee said simply that he thought it was a great idea for a film, "something that could be exciting to see.""The whole idea of being able to predict a murder in the future and having this prevention team, this pre-crime team go out and stop it before it happened!" he exclaimed. "I just thought that was a great idea. ... I just thought it was a compelling story. It wasn't a conscious thing of me saying, 'I want to try something different.' I always want to try something different."Cruise insisted that he approached working with the legendary director of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Jaws" the same way he would with any filmmaker, stating he never worried about the fact that Spielberg is as famous and powerful a Hollywood titan as he is."No. I never think of that," Cruise remarked. "Ever. When you're working, it's not something you think about. He's a filmmaker. Steven is a storyteller and I'm the actor and it's just that relationship. It's not weird. It's not contentious in any way. It's very much the opposite. He's focused on the story. He's someone who is relaxed and pretty easy. He's concerned about his story. He's not someone who takes anything for granted, either, which is quite wonderful. He's looking for a story and is committed to telling that."Cruise said he read an early version of the screenplay for "Minority Report" when he was filming Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" in England several years ago. He was so intrigued by the tale that he immediately picked up a copy of the Philip K. Dick short story it was based on. As much as he enjoyed Dick's prose, Cruise said he liked the script for the movie better. "I think what Scott Frank did with the screenplay was wonderful," Cruise said. "That short story is not a feature film. It's a short story and it's a wonderful short story, but when you talk about making it into a movie which runs two-plus hours there are different expectations and limitations and also doors opening. So, I feel that the (original) story is still there. It's a launching pad."One of the aspects of the film that most appealed to Cruise was Spielberg's choice to set it 50, not hundreds of years in the future."That makes it a world that's accessible for an audience," Cruise added. Admitting that the movie became a lot more realistic since Sept. 11 of last year, the 39-year-old superstar stated: "Look at what's happening today, right now, as we're doing this interview, in terms of privacy issues and what we're all going to be asked to give up. (The film) made it very immediate for me when I read it and I think it will be for the audience, too."In addition to having a fun summer movie he is proud to promote, Cruise is also enjoying his relationship with gorgeous "Vanilla Sky" co-star Penelope Cruz.Although he remains tight-lipped about specifics, he did manage to gush briefly: "What you see with Penelope is who she is. She's very generous and obviously very beautiful. There's a real sweetness and intelligence. She's funny and just a lovely person to be with."So, what about all those wretched rumors that keep dogging him?"Rumors. I live for the rumors. I live for that. It's ridiculous," he replied, adding that he never read the tabloids and gossip sheets before he was famous. "It's irresponsible if it's not true," he continued. "And they know it's not true. They sit around and make stuff up. But it is what it is. I don't enjoy gossip, even in my private life. It just doesn't interest me and it never has. It is what it is and I don't lose a lot of sleep over it. They'll call and ask, 'Are you getting married?' 'No.' I don't even answer it. Pat Kingsley (his publicist) will say no. Then the paper will say, 'Tom Cruise Is Getting Married,' and in small letters it will say, 'But he denies it.' It's just ridiculous." Asked how he might know about headlines since he claims never to read them, Cruise quipped, "Well, I only know from my previous lawsuits."

PRINCETON, N.J., April 8 (UPI) -- After years of skepticism, Americans are more likely to express concern or worry about global warming, though some still say it's exaggerated, a poll indicates.In a poll released by Gallup, 58 percent of Americans say they worry either a great deal or fair amount, about global warming.This is an increase from 51 percent in 2011 but still below the 62 percent to 72 percent levels seen in earlier years, a Gallup release reported Monday.When asked if they have worries about global warming, 33 percent of respondents said they worry "a great deal," 25 percent worry "a fair amount," 20 percent "only a little" and 23 percent "not at all."Over the last 20 years public concern over global warming has fluctuated between about 50 percent to 72 percent, with an average percentage in that time for "worrying a great deal/fair amount" of just slightly less than 60 percent, Gallup said.Americans are less likely than in the recent past to consider news about global warming exaggerated, with 41 percent in the current poll saying so, down from 48 percent in 2010, which was an all-time high.The poll was conducted by telephone between March 7-10, with a random sample of 1,022 adults and a reported margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

| License Photo	FLORHAM PARK, N.J., Dec. 31 (UPI) -- New York Jets General Manager Mike Tannenbaum won't return for the 2013 season but Coach Rex Ryan will be back, the team's chief executive officer said Monday.Woody Johnson issued a statement that said a search for a replacement for Tannenbaum would begin immediately.Johnson thanked Tannenbaum, 43, for his 15 years of service with the Jets. Tannenbaum had been general manager since 2006."Although he helped us to two consecutive AFC Championship games, we are not where we want to be and a new general manager will be critical to getting this team back on the right track," Johnson said.The Jets finished 2012 with a 6-10 record, which was tied for third with the Buffalo Bills in the AFC East. Buffalo beat the Jets 28-9 in Sunday's regular-season finale.Johnson said Ryan would be back for a fifth season as head coach. The record in 2012 was the first sub-.500 season for Ryan as a head coach. He is 34-30 in four years as the Jets' coach."Rex Ryan will remain the head coach of our football team. I believe that he has the passion, the talent and the drive to successfully lead our team," Johnson said."Like all Jets fans, I am disappointed with this year's results. However, I am confident that this change will best position our team for greater success going forward."

CHAPEL HILL, N.C., Dec. 18 (UPI) -- A clutch offensive rebound by Demarcus Holland and his ensuing layup with three seconds left Wednesday brought Texas an 86-83 win over No. 18 North Carolina.The Tar Heels overcame a 12-point deficit in the second half to tie it with 2:14 to go, but Texas made the key plays down the stretch to win its sixth in a row.Texas had a one-point lead when Holland went to the foul line with seven seconds remaining. He missed both attempts, but dashed down the lane to grab the rebound on his second miss. Holland followed that with a layup that accounted for the final score.Marcus Paige missed a 3-point try for the Tar Heels at the buzzer.Texas (10-1) outrebounded North Carolina 51-37 to help overcome the Tar Heels' constant but often unsuccessful parade to the foul line. North Carolina went 24-of-47 from the charity stripe and the Tar Heels would have finished below 50 percent had Paige not made all eight of his attempts.Isaiah Taylor led Texas with 16 points, Jonathan Holmes had 15 and Holland added 13.Paige paced the Tar Heels (7-3) with 23 points and eight rebounds.

MEMPHIS, July 14 (UPI) -- A Tennessee man was sentenced to life in prison with no parole after he admitted killing an acquaintance and burning his body.The hearing Wednesday ended the legal proceedings involving Dale Mardis, 57, The (Memphis) Commercial Appeal reported. He is already serving a 15-year state sentence for the 2001 killing of Shelby County Code Enforcement Officer Mickey Wright and life for a federal hate crimes charge involving the Wright killing.Mardis, an overweight man who appeared in court in a wheelchair, admitted he killed Henry Ackerman with a hammer during a 1998 argument. Ackerman, who had moved from Memphis to Baltimore, visited Mardis, an acquaintance from gun shows, on a trip back to Tennessee.The bodies of Wright and Ackerman have never been found. Mardis said during a hearing in March he burned Wright's body in a 55-gallon drum on a friend's property in Mississippi."It is a bizarre, epic and tragic story," Tom Henderson, the prosecutor, said after the killing.

| License Photo	Feb. 12 (UPI) -- In keeping with the tone of public statements in the past weeks, excerpts released ahead of the State of the Union show President Obama will focus on job creation in his annual address to Congress.The following are the excerpts from the Tuesday's speech, as prepared for deliver.It is our generation’s task, then, to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth – a rising, thriving middle class.
It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country – the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love.
It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation of ours.
…
A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs – that must be the North Star that guides our efforts. Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?
…
Tonight, I’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat – nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.
