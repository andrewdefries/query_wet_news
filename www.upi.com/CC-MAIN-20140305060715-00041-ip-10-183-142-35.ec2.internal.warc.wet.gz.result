LONDON, Jan. 16 (UPI) -- British supermarket giant Tesco pulled ground beef from sale Tuesday after inspectors reported finding horse meat in burgers sold in Britain and Ireland. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland reported that 37 percent of the burgers it tested showed traces of horse DNA, The Daily Telegraph reported. Some Everyday Value Beef Burgers were as much as 29 percent horsemeat. "The presence of illegal meat in our products is extremely serious," said Tim Smith, a Tesco executive. "Our customers have the right to expect that food they buy is produced to the highest standards."Investigators also found horse DNA in ground beef products sold by Iceland, ALDI, Lidl and Dunnes, officials said.Pig DNA was reportedly discovered in a wide variety of beef products. This raises questions for Jews and Muslims whose dietary rules ban pork. Beef containing horse DNA came from Liffey Meats and Silvercrest food processing plants in Ireland and Dalepak Hambleton in North Yorkshire.

ALBUQUERQUE, Jan. 10 (UPI) -- A very light, fuel-efficient business jet from Eclipse Aerospace has been presented to the U.S. Air Force for undergraduate-level pilot training.The aircraft, a twin-engine plane, could help the Air Force cut fuel used in the Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training Track program by 13 million gallons annually if it were to replace the 20-year-old fleet of business jets now used, the company said."I have met with senior Air Force leaders and they are looking for an efficient and affordable solution to their challenges (of fuel consumption)," said Eclipse Chief Executive Officer Mason Holland.The offering was in response for an Air Force Response for Information notice.The aircraft is reportedly 70 percent more efficient in fuel consumption and 70 percent less expensive to maintain than current aircraft used in the training program."Our submittal was fully responsive to the Air Force's request," Holland said. "It shows that the Eclipse Jet meets and/or exceeds all of the SUPT syllabus requirements."More important, from a budgetary viewpoint, our response demonstrates how the USAF can save over $1 billion of O&M costs over 10 by converting to an Eclipse Jet fleet."

ORANGE, Calif., May 21 (UPI) -- Organizers of the "Undie Run" at California's Chapman University said about 1,000 students donated their clothes to charity and jogged in their skivvies.The run, a non-school-sponsored event that takes place each winter and spring during finals week, featured an increased police presence Wednesday night after the December run resulted in $13,000 in damage to a 71-year-old fountain, the Orange County (Calif.) Register reported Wednesday.Sophomore Adam Whitfield and senior Gabby Bashist, leaders of student group Action in Africa, said clothing shed by students before running in their bras, panties, boxers, briefs and thongs was collected in garbage bags and will be donated to a Ugandan orphanage."The orphanage we're collecting clothes for burned down last summer." Bashist said. "We're collecting clothes for over 250 children who have nothing left."The night culminated in a dance at the school's gym, which was decked out with a giant inflatable pool filled with foam to compensate for the lack of fountain use this year.

NEW YORK, Oct. 31 (UPI) -- Climate change skeptics are playing up recent indications of a slowdown in global warming but heat may be stored below the surface of oceans, a U.S. study said.Scientists reconstructing Pacific Ocean temperatures for the last 10,000 years found its middle depths have warmed 15 times faster in the last 60 years than they did during apparent natural warming cycles in the previous 10,000 years, the Earth Institute at Columbia University reported Thursday.Although many scientists agree much of the heat humans have put into the atmosphere since the 1970s through greenhouse gas emissions probably has been absorbed by the ocean, the new study suggests the oceans may be storing even more of the effects of human emissions than scientists have so far realized, a Columbia release said."We're experimenting by putting all this heat in the ocean without quite knowing how it's going to come back out and affect climate," said study coauthor Braddock Linsley, a climate scientist at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. "It's not so much the magnitude of the change, but the rate of change."The study refutes claims by climate change skeptics that industrial carbon emissions are not causing a century-long rise in Earth's surface temperatures, the researchers said."We may have underestimated the efficiency of the oceans as a storehouse for heat and energy," study lead author Yair Rosenthal, a climate scientist at Rutgers University, said. "It may buy us some time -- how much time, I don't really know. But it's not going to stop climate change."

ALBUQUERQUE, Aug. 16 (UPI) -- An Albuquerque man saved his 6-year-old neighbor by calling police while he chased an alleged kidnapper, police say.The neighbor saw a man attempt to coax the girl into his van Monday afternoon at a playground, KRQE-TV, Albuquerque, reported."The child was being resistant to his enticement and that is what caused him to get out of the car and actually push her into the van," Albuquerque police Officer Robert Gibbs said.The neighbor, whose name was not reported, got in his car and tailed the van while calling 911.Police say the suspected kidnapper, Phil Garcia, noticed he was being followed and tried to get away -- but ended up crashing the van and fleeing without the girl on foot.Garcia was apprehended by police on the mesa. The girl is OK but her mother was very distressed, police said.The neighbor told police he just acted on instinct. Gibbs said the neighbor's action may have saved the girl's life."(Garcia) probably would not have attempted or tired to get away in the desert probably would have tried to go down a normal road taken her somewhere probably sexually assaulted her and could have hurt or actually killed her," Gibbs said.Garcia, who has no criminal record involving sex crimes, has had two DWI convictions, the report said.

PHOENIX, April 2 (UPI) -- A transgendered man said he will appeal after his divorce request was rejected by an Arizona judge, who called his marriage an invalid same-sex marriage.Thomas Beattie, 39, was born a woman and had sexual reassignment surgery to become a man, receiving a new name, Social Security number and passport, but kept his reproductive organs.. He married his wife, Nancy, in Hawaii, and in 2003 achieved notoriety as a "Pregnant Man," becoming pregnant because his wife was unable to have children, KNXV-TV, Phoenix, reported Tuesday.The couple have three children.Last week a Maricopa County judge ruled their marriage could not be dissolved, citing it as a same-sex marriage and not recognized in Arizona."It's a fight for validation," said Beattie's attorney, David Michael Carter. "Hawaii recognized the marriage."

OSLO, Norway, Oct. 11 (UPI) -- The head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says winning the Nobel Peace Prize will "boost morale" among staff members.It was announced Friday that the OPCW was the 2013 recipient of the Noble Peace Prize."I see it as a recognition in fact, of contributions made by our organization to global peace and security over the past sixteen years of its existence," said Ahmet Uzumcu, director-general of the organization, in an interview with Nobelprize.org following the announcement. "Clearly, this award, in fact, is a recognition of all those who worked in the OPCW, as well as all those who represented their countries here in The Hague, a credit to the organization over those years."Uzumcu went on to say that his organization has contributed to the destruction of 80 percent of the world's chemical weapons, but that the conflict in Syria, which has a large stockpile of chemical weapons, presents a challenge to the OPCW. "Syria poses a particular challenge to our organization, where there is a considerable amount of chemical weapons," he said."I think the Nobel Peace Prize, in fact, will give a new impetus and encouragement, I should say, great incentive to our staff who are working in the secretariat, and who are deployed also in Syria for the past two-three weeks, and this will boost their morale in order to fulfill their mission," Uzumcu added.U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement congratulating the OPCW for its achievement."I want to congratulate the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for winning the Nobel Peace Prize," Obama said. "The world will never forget the loss of the more than 1,000 innocent Syrians senselessly killed with chemical weapons on Aug. 21.""Since that horrific attack, the OPCW has taken extraordinary steps and worked with unprecedented speed to address this blatant violation of international norms that shocked the conscience of people around the world," Obama said. "Just a few weeks ago, a united international community came together at the OPCW and the United Nations to establish a clear path toward eliminating Syria's chemical weapons forever."Since the 1990s, the OPCW has, through inspections, destruction and other means, tried to implement a convention to prohibit chemical weapons, their production and their storage, the Nobel Committee said in a release.The convention has 189 signatories to date."The conventions and the work of the OPCW have defined the use of chemical weapons as a taboo under international law," the committee release said. Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have been used, "have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons," the release said. The committee noted some countries still weren't OPCW members while others have missed deadlines for destroying chemical arms, singling out the United States and Russia for missing an April 2012 deadline."Disarmament figures prominently in Alfred Nobel's will," the committee release said. "By means of the present award to the OPCW, the Committee is seeking to contribute to the elimination of chemical weapons."
