NEW DELHI, Oct. 9 (UPI) -- U.S. discount retail giant Walmart said Wednesday it would buy Bharti Enterprises's half of their joint venture in India for an undisclosed sum.The Economic Times reported the deal is subject to approval by regulators. "Upon receipt of required clearances, Walmart would acquire Bharti's stake in Bharti Walmart Pvt. Ltd. ... giving Walmart 100 percent ownership of the Best Price Modern Wholesale cash and carry business," the companies said in a joint statement.The business is currently a 50-50 venture.Bharti has also agreed to purchase compulsory convertible debentures or CCDs worth $100 million held by Walmart in a company called Cedar Support Services.CCDs are debt-like investments that are converted to equity at a contracted time.Walmart's investment in Cedar Support Services is currently under investigation for market violations, the Times reported."Given the circumstances, our decision to operate independently will be beneficial to both parties," Walmart Asia President and Chief Executive Officer Scott Price said in a statement."Through Walmart's investment in India, including our cash and carry business, supply chain infrastructure, direct farm program and supplier development, we want to serve India and its people, and continue to make important social and environmental contributions to the country," Price said.

CHESTER BASIN, Nova Scotia, May 7 (UPI) -- A Canadian 12th-grader suspended for wearing a "Life Is Wasted Without Jesus" T-shirt was pulled from school by his father over a religious tolerance forum.William Swinimer, a student at Forest Heights Community School in Chester Basin, Novas Scotia, was initially suspended for five days for refusing to stop coming to school wearing the T-shirt. He was allowed to return -- T-shirt included -- under a South Shore Regional School Board ruling Friday, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported Monday.However, his father, John Swinimer, said he pulled his son out of the school when he learned all students were scheduled to attend a religious tolerance session Monday to learn how to respectfully express their beliefs."He will not attend this school unless they are having reading, writing and arithmetic -- good old-fashioned academics," John Swinimer said. "When they're having forums, when they're having other extracurricular activity, he will not attend that school."Students at the school said the younger Swinimer would often make students feel uncomfortable by preaching his beliefs."It started with him preaching his religion to kids and then telling them to go to hell. A lot of kids don't want to deal with this anymore," said Katelyn Hiltz, the student council vice president.The students said the T-shirt was the last straw that led to their complaints, but it was not how the issue started."He's told kids they'll burn in hell if they don't confess themselves to Jesus," student Riley Gibb-Smith said.

ARMONK, N.Y., Feb. 1 (UPI) -- U.S. technology giant IBM said in a regulatory filing its top-tier management team will pass on bonuses for 2013 due to disappointing sales results.The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday the company's compensation committee approved the proposal Friday to have the senior management skip bonuses for the year.IBM reported a revenue drop of 4.6 percent in 2013.The bonus package that had been set up for Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty was $4 million and that figure will roll over to 2014, the Journal said.The incentive package for Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge, who retired Dec. 31, was more than $1 million. Senior Vice President and Group Executive of software and systems Steven Mills had an incentive target set at $968,000, the Journal said.

MARANA, Ariz., Feb. 21 (UPI) -- Charles Howell III and Shane Lowry defeated golf's top two players in huge first-round upsets Thursday at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship.Lowry defeated boyhood friend and world No. 1 Rory McIlroy 1-up and Howell ousted the sport's second-ranked player, Tiger Woods, 2-and-1.The shocking setback for McIlroy extended a disappointing start to the year for a player expected to become one of the sport's dominant figures. He missed the cut in his only other appearance of the season.Luke Donald and Louis Oosthuizen, the third and fourth-seeded players in this event behind McIlroy and Woods, both survived close matches Thursday.Donald was a 1-up winner over Marcel Siem and Oosthuizen defeated Richie Ramsay 2-and-1.The opening round began on Wednesday, but was suspended due to a heavy snowfall. The second round will be played Thursday and the third round will get underway.Among Thursday's surprises were a 1-up victory for PGA Tour rookie Russell Henley over former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel, Alexander Noren's 6-and-4 demolition of Dustin Johnson and the 1-up win for Richard Sterne over Jason Dufner.Sergio Garcia, Matt Kuchar, Ian Poulter, Bubba Watson, Steve Stricker, Jim Furyk and defending champion Hunter Mahan all advanced.Lowry chipped in for birdies at both the 11th and 12th holes of his match with McIlroy and then took a 2-up lead at the par-5 13th with an eagle. McIlroy also suffered three bogeys and a double bogey during the match.The Woods-Howell confrontation was all square with four holes to play, but Howell birdied both the 15th and 16th to seize the advantage.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, July 22 (UPI) -- Hot muggy weather blanketed much of the Midwest and East Coast Friday, with temperatures reaching triple digits from Washington to New York.The heat moved east while still affecting a swathe of the central section from Kansas to the Ohio Valley, the National Weather Service said.In Newark, N.J., the mercury hit 108 degrees in early afternoon, the highest temperature ever recorded in the city, The New York Times reported. In Central Park, the nation's oldest weather station, the high was 104, the highest temperature in New York City since 1977.At Dulles International Airport outside Washington and in Baltimore, the high was 105 degrees.Christopher Vaccaro, an NWS spokesman, told the Times one measure of how hot the summer has been so far in much of the United States is that 1,400 temperature records were broken or tied in July across the country.About two dozen deaths have been blamed on the heat wave.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg asked residents to set thermostats at 79 degrees to conserve electricity."Not having electricity would be a lot more uncomfortable," he said on his weekly radio show.Saturday was expected to be uncomfortably hot and humid in the Northeast as well, with temperatures dropping slightly Sunday."The worst part of this heat wave is that lows at night will only drop into the 80s due to the extremely high humidity," senior meteorologist Henry Margusity of Accuweather.com. "This means there will be no time for people to cool off."

| License Photo	TALLAHASSEE, Fla., July 10 (UPI) -- An alligator believed to be the one that attacked a teenage Florida boy has been captured by a trapper, the state's Fish and Wildlife Commission said. Commission spokeswoman Joy Hill said the gator was found very close to where 17-year-old Andrew Hudson was swimming in Little Big Econ State Forest, the Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel reported Wednesday.Hudson required several stitches after an alligator bit him on his head and back Monday afternoon.Hill said it is impossible to know for certain that the 12-foot reptile captured is the one that bit Hudson."But the fact that it was easily attracted to bait that was set very close to where Hudson was bitten, and it showed little fear of the trapper, indicates a high probability that it is the alligator we were targeting," she said.

| License Photo	TOKYO, April 5 (UPI) -- Land occupied by a U.S. military base in Okinawa could be returned to Japan within the next decade under a plan announced Friday by Japan's prime minister.More than 2,500 acres on which U.S. military facilities are located would eventually be given back for Japanese use, The Yomiuri Shimbun reported Saturday.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said 2022 was the earliest year all the property at the U.S. Marine Corps' Futenma Air Station could be returned. The exact date will be determined by the United States' ability to relocate all the equipment and personnel.Some portions of the base will come into Japanese control as early as this year, while other portions are not expected to be returned until 2025, the newspaper said.The U.S. fuel depot and Camp Kuwae in the town of Chatan, as well as the Naha Port facilities are included in the plan.Futenma is located in a densely populated part of the island. Under an earlier agreement, the base was to be returned in 1996.

Sept. 4 (UPI) -- Toyota will recall 369,000 vehicles sold around the world, including 235,000 Lexus and Highlander Hybrid models in the U.S., the Japanese automaker said in a press release Wednesday. The car company said that the two voluntary safety recalls based in the U.S. involve Highlander Hybrid models from 2006 to 2010 and Lexus RX 400h models from 2006 to 2008, along with Lexus IS 350, IS 350C, and GS 350 from 2006 to 2011. Toyota said that the problem with the first two sets of SUV models -- the Highlander Hybrids and the Lexus RX 400h -- overheating transistors could cause the cars to shut down automatically when they're still moving. In the other batch of models, loose bolts could cause the car to stop during operation. A Toyota rep told CNN Money that no one had reported any injuries or accidents related to the vehicles' problems.
