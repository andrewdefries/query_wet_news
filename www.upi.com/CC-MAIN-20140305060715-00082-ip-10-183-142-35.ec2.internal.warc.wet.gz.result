NEW YORK, May 17 (UPI) -- The U.S. index of leading economic indicators fell 0.1 percent in April after six consecutive month of gains, the Conference Board said Thursday.The Leading Economic Index fell to 95.5, following an increase of 0.3 percent in March and a 0.7 percent increase in February.Economists had predicted a 0.1 percent gain.The Leading Economic Index, which takes into account 10 economic components, is essentially a comparison with 2004, the year the Conference Board assigned a level of 100.The declines in April "reflect an economy that's still struggling to gain momentum. Growth is slow, but choppy, and consumers, executives and investors are looking for more progress," said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein.The Conference Board said their Coincident Index, which measures current conditions, rose 0.2 percent in April to 104.3, following increases of 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent in March and February, respectively.

| License Photo	SEATTLE, Jan. 4 (UPI) -- Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was evacuated from the Galapagos Islands after being stricken by kidney stones, the Ecuadorean navy said.The navy said in a release Bezos was flown by helicopter to Baltra Island where he was transferred to a private plane that took him to the United States for emergency surgery, ABC News reported. But an Amazon spokesman later told CNN no surgery was required."He got a good outcome. No surgery was required, and he's feeling well," CNN quoted Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener as saying Saturday.In response to the ABC's inquiry about Bezos' condition Saturday night, a representative for the Seattle-based online shopping site replied in an email, "I sent the inquiry to Jeff and here's what he sent back: 'Galapagos: five stars. Kidney stones: zero stars.'" CNN reported an Ecuadorean navy spokesman, Lt. Pablo Abarca, said Bezos, 49, developed renal colic while on a cruise near Santa Cruz Island and was flown to Baltra Island on New Year's Day.

BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Oct. 12 (UPI) -- Northern Ireland this week responded to a food price crisis by adding $24 million to the amount struggling Ulster farmers will receive from EU subsidies.Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill announced Wednesday at a Northern Ireland Assembly hearing on the plight of farmers facing low prices and adverse weather the government will put more of the EU Single Farm Payment subsidies into their pockets."I have great sympathy with farmers as they struggle with rising production costs and problems stemming from difficult weather conditions," she said. "That is why today I have taken direct action to ensure that farmers will receive more money in their Single Farm Payment in 2013."The Assembly's Agriculture and Rural Development Committee called on O'Neill to address what they called a crisis for the region's farmers, brought on not only by rising production costs and persistent bad weather, but also by "a lack of transparency in the supply chain."Farmers blame Ulster's increasingly concentrated food production industry for unfairly and arbitrarily doling out "farm gate" prices much lower than those found elsewhere in Britain and in the Irish Republic.O'Neill said the government next year would reduce by $24 million the amount of "modulation money" it now deducts from EU farm subsidies. The European Union gives member governments the ability to use the money for rural development programs."Other administrations in Britain will make use of this provision again (in 2013)," she said. "However, given the very real challenges facing our farmers, I have decided not to continue to apply voluntary modulation next year. "This will provide some much needed additional income for farmers in their 2013 SFP payments and will help to stimulate the rural communities in which farmers live and spend their money."The announcement came as warnings about the survival of Northern Ireland's farm sector have become more strident in recent months. Farmers say they're facing prices for meat, dairy, vegetables and other foodstuffs so low they won't cover the costs of production.Agriculture and Rural Development Committee Chairman Paul Frew of the Democratic Unionist Party said the government needs to "acknowledge the crisis.""More must be done to help our farmers receive a fairer price for their products, otherwise one of the most important industries in Northern Ireland could be in danger of collapse," he said."Unfairness" in the supply chain from farmer to supermarket shelf has been targeted by the Ulster Farmers Union for special criticism.Organization President Harry Sinclair told the Northern Ireland publication Farming Life he applauded the government for being "pro-active" in scrapping the voluntary modulation for next year."Whilst farmers will see no immediate boost to their incomes, it is nevertheless a genuine move to assist them," he said.But, he added, he also wants to see similar help "from our food chain partners."In 2012, the food chain has failed, with processors and retailers choosing to ignore farmers' rising costs but this is a short-sighted approach which is also bad news for consumers," Sinclair said.O'Neill said she is "committed to lending my support to address any unfairness in the food supply chain," pointing to the forthcoming British law that will create an adjudicator to oversee the relationship between large supermarket chains and their suppliers."I welcome the forthcoming introduction of the Grocery Adjudicator Bill and have written to (Vincent Cable), the minister of Business, Innovation and Skills in Westminster, emphasizing the need for early introduction of an adjudicator with real power," she said.

NEW DELHI, Feb. 15 (UPI) -- French President Francois Hollande has met with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with a special look at defense relations on the agenda.Underscoring the importance of the visit, Hollande was accompanied by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian along with the chief executive officers of more than 60 leading French firms.A French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the trip was aimed at building on the "strategic Indo-French partnership launched 15 years ago."Hollande said that, after his meeting with Singh, he was certain that India was carefully considering all options for major defense purchases.Hollande added that the Indian government was committed to considering all foreign applications for big-ticket items in the India's Ministry of Defense pipeline and that an element of his visit was to highlight French companies interested in the Indian market.Singh averred, "The discussion on the (contract) is progressing well," Singh said, adding that "some progress has been achieved."The majority of India's international contracts are in the defense sector, which has been dogged by allegations of bribery and corruption. In addressing corruption allegations in a civil nuclear contract for France's bid for participating in the construction of India's Jaitapur nuclear power plant, Hollande promised that France's transactions with India would be fully transparent.In visiting the South Asian economic powerhouse, Hollande is making his first visit to an emerging economy, with diplomatic sources emphasizing that Paris chose India over Brazil, the Russia Federation and South Africa.Singh and Hollande stated that their mutual interest was cooperation in high technology programs, including bilateral research and development and transfer of technology, one of India's highest priorities.Hollande noted that joint venture projects already online included the Indian navy's indigenously built Scorpene submarine and the upgrading of the Indian air force's French-built Mirage 2000 with negotiations progressing. He also said discussions continue to finalize the joint French-Indian Short Range Surface to Air Missile air defense project.Hollande's top defense priority is to secure the Indian air force purchase of 126 Rafale fighters from French arms manufacturer Dassault, a potential deal worth $12 billion. India chose the firm in 2012 but says that the contract won't be signed until midyear.Franco-Indian trade levels remain modest, in 2012 worth $10 billion and France imports more than it sells to India.Singh and Hollande, besides noting the progress on bilateral cooperation on the Scorpene submarine, Mirage 2000 and SRSAM joint ventures, reiterated their ongoing interest in negotiations on the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft program.New Delhi diplomatic sources speaking not for attribution said that given France's inside track in New Delhi, Rafael's closest competitor, the four-nation Eurofighter consortium, had essentially abandoned its bid for India's new fighter tender, as had Germany, previously the leading country for the Indian air force combat fighter contract.

CINCINNATI, March 4 (UPI) -- An elections employee in Ohio was banned from using the Internet at work and lost a day's pay for using an online dating website during work hours.Ken Spruce of Cincinnati, a Hamilton County Board of Elections data clerk, appealed the disciplinary action against him Monday morning, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported.He alleged other employees in the office used the Internet for personal reasons while on the clock without discipline.Spruce, who was caught looking at Match.com several times in February, despite being asked not to use the dating website, called the board's computer policy "outdated" and "insufficient" to the "corporate and business environment of today."However, the board decided to uphold its original ruling barring Spruce from using the Internet while at work and docking him one day's pay.Deputy Board of Elections Director Sally Krisel said employees going to non-work related websites could compromise voter registration security. In the past employees have unwittingly let in viruses, Krisel said.

BERKELEY, Calif., Nov. 7 (UPI) -- A long-abandoned fermentation technique once used to make explosives can be used to produce renewable diesel fuel to replace fossil fuels, U.S. researchers say.Chemists and chemical engineers at the University of California, Berkley, said they've produced diesel fuel from the products of a bacterial fermentation process discovered nearly 100 years ago.Those products can extracted and catalytically altered to make a fuel that burns like diesel, they said.The fermentation process was discovered in 1914, around the start of World War I, and allowed Britain to produce acetone needed to manufacture cordite, used as a military explosive to replace gunpowder.The process employs the bacterium Colostrum acetobutylicum to ferment sugars into acetone, butanol and ethanol. A catalyst then converts the ideally proportioned brew into a mix of long-chain hydrocarbons that resembles the combination of hydrocarbons in diesel fuel.The resulting product was found to burn as well as normal petroleum-based diesel fuel.While the fuel's cost is still higher than that of diesel or gasoline made from fossil fuels, the process would drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation that contribute to global climate change, the researchers said."Diesel could put Clostridium back in business, helping us to reduce global warming," biomolecular engineering Professor Douglas Clark said. "That is one of the main drivers behind this research."

HOUSTON, July 5 (UPI) -- The Texas State Board of Education is considering replacing its student-centered English curriculum with teacher-centered instruction.The Houston Chronicle said the plan to rewrite the English standards is viewed by some as the opening shot in an effort to put a conservative imprint on the state's curriculum."We could see a lot of textbooks that are based on personal and political beliefs of a majority of the state board rather than on facts that students need to learn," Dan Quinn, a spokesman for the Texas Freedom Network -- a group that monitors the state board for influence by the religious right -- told the newspaper.The current curriculum calls on students to use their own attitudes and ethics to interpret texts, while teacher-centered instruction emphasizes the basics of spelling, grammar and punctuation.While it's unlikely that the English curriculum discussion will veer toward any political ideology, the effort could set the stage for the 2008 review of science standards, Quinn said.He said if the science curriculum is rewritten to include religious-based ideas such as intelligent design, the books will follow suit.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 (UPI) -- The Rev. Luis Leon, rector of St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, was tapped Tuesday to give the benediction at President Obama's second inauguration. Leon replaces Louie Giglio, pastor of a megachurch in Atlanta, USA Today reported. Giglio decided not to participate in the inauguration because of controversy over remarks he made several years ago opposing gay marriage. For Leon, it will be his second appearance at a presidential inauguration. He gave the benediction for President George W. Bush in 2005."I don't mind being in the bullpen; relievers are very important," Leon told the CNN Belief Blog.In a departure from tradition, Obama has asked civil rights leader Myrlie Evers-Williams to deliver the invocation even though she is not a member of the clergy. St. John's on Lafayette Square near the White House has been nicknamed "church of the presidents" because every president since James Madison has attended services there, although not all have been members. The parish was organized in 1815 and the building completed in 1816.

April 18 (UPI) -- Three men from the United Arab Emirates were expelled from the Jenadrivah Heritage and Culture Festival in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Sunday over concerns they were too handsome for women to resist. The Telegraph reports, The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vices in Saudi Arabia had the men deported back to Abu Dhabi to prevent women from falling for them.The UAE said religious officials were anxious over the unexpected presence of an unnamed female artist in the pavilion. “Her visit to the UAE stand was a coincidence as it was not included in the program which we had already provided to the festival’s management,” Saeed Al Kaabi the head of the UAE festival delegation said in a statement. It is unclear if the men, who were at the festival as part of UAE's delegation, were deported in relation to the artist's presence. The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vices is Saudi Arabia's religious police and it was established to enforce the country's strict Sharia law.

Richard Joseph "Dick" Durbin (born November 21, 1944) is the senior United States Senator from Illinois and the Senate Majority Whip, the second highest position in the Democratic Party leadership in the Senate.
Born in East St. Louis, Illinois, he graduated from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and Georgetown University Law Center. Working in state legal counsel throughout the 1970s, he made an unsuccessful run for Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in 1978. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, representing the Springfield-based 20th congressional district. In 1996 he won election to the U.S. Senate by an unexpected 15-point margin. He has served as Senate Democratic Whip since 2005, and assumed his current title when the Democratic Party obtained a majority in 2007. As a member of the Democratic leadership, he has a record as one of the most liberal members of Congress.
Durbin was born in East St. Louis, Illinois to an Irish-American father, William Durbin, and a Lithuanian-born mother, Ann Kutkin (Lithuanian: Ona Kutkaitė). He graduated from Assumption High School in East St. Louis in 1962. During his high school years he worked at a meatpacking plant. He earned a B.S. from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in 1966. He was an intern in the office of Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois during his senior year in college. Durbin earned his J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1969 and was admitted to the Illinois bar later that year.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
