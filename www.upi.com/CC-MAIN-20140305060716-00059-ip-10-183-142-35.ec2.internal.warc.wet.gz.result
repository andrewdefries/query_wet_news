CALGARY, Alberta, May 7 (UPI) -- Canadian pipeline company Enbridge has less than four years to update its pump stations after most were cited for violations, a regulator said.Canada's National Energy Board said 117 of the 125 pump stations in the country operated by Enbridge weren't in line with safety regulations.NEB spokeswoman Carole Leger-Kubeczek said the company didn't have the means to close certain valves remotely as required by onshore pipeline regulations, The Globe and Mail reports.The NEB notified Enbridge, however, that it was satisfied with a work plan outlined by Enbridge that calls for phased updates on its pipeline systems through 2016.Enbridge Vice President for Strategy David Bryson said problems were uncovered in 2011. Pump stations had backup battery power, though NEB requires on-site generators as a redundancy measure.He was quoted as saying Enbridge believed it was in compliance because of the battery backups."Obviously the NEB has clarified that for us, which is why we're putting together an action plan to add additional backup power," he said.Enbridge plans to build the Northern Gateway pipeline to the West Coast has come up against opposition from provincial and environmental leaders concerned about the safety of transporting oil sands from Alberta province.

| License Photo	HOUSTON, May 18 (UPI) -- The fifth and final U.S. spacewalk to repair and refurbish the Hubble Space Telescope was completed Monday with all goals of the mission accomplished.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said astronauts John Grunsfeld and Drew Feustel, among other things, installed new protective thermal insulation panels on the telescope's three bay doors and replaced one of the telescope's fine guidance sensors that provide pointing information, as well as determining precise position and motion of stars.The fifth and final planned Hubble repair spacewalk began at 8:20 a.m. EDT and ended at 3:22 p.m.After completing their scheduled tasks, the astronauts cleaned up the space shuttle Atlantis payload bay in which Hubble was tethered and where the work was performed. They then closed the space telescope for what's expected to be the last time.The work performed during the mission was designed to allow the space telescope to continue working to at least 2014, It was to be placed back into orbit Tuesday.NASA said Hubble' science observations are expected to resume approximately three weeks after the shuttle departs.Before ending the 7-hour and 2-minute spacewalk, Grunsfeld said: "This is a really tremendous adventure that we've been on, a very challenging mission. Hubble isn't just a satellite -- it's about humanity's quest for knowledge."

DOVER, Del., June 3 (UPI) -- Jimmie Johnson led for the final 76 laps and bested Kevin Harvick by 2.6 seconds Sunday to win the FedEx 400 at Dover International Speedway.Johnson held the lead for 289 laps overall in winning for the seventh time in his career at Dover, tying Richard Petty and Bobby Allison for most all-time wins at the racetrack.It was Johnson's second victory of the season and the fourth straight for a Hendrick Motorsports driver. The race featured a 12-car crash in the ninth lap -- the biggest so far in the 2012 Sprint Cup season. It was precipitated when Tony Stewart made contact with Landon Cassill. Both drivers spun around, as did Regan Smith, triggering a chain reaction on the backstretch.There were no injuries in the mishap, which delayed the race for 20 minutes.Matt Kenseth finished third, followed by Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Clint Bowyer.Greg Biffle remained the points leader despite an 11th-place finish.

WARSAW, Poland, March 8 (UPI) -- Europe's food scandals are multiplying with the discovery of rotten meat recycled into Polish processed products and seizure of suspect Swedish food as far as China.Analysts said European food industry could face a crisis if scandals continue spreading beyond controversies over unexpected horsemeat content in food.EU food exports serve a global market and earn Europe billions of dollars in revenue.Only this month the Warsaw Voice handed Polish food an award "in appreciation of its exceptional taste and quality."Now Polish food inspectors are investigating the industry after they shut down a factory accused of processing returned meat into new products.Poland reported a surplus of $4.3 billion in its food trade in 2012, higher than in any other sector of its economy.Swedish retail group Ikea faced more trouble across Europe and in China after its minced meat and sausages were found to be contaminated with horsemeat and chocolate cakes sold in China produced high traces of fecal bacteria.Europe exports processed foods worldwide, including countries that don't have adequate food analysis infrastructure. The discovery of food contamination beyond horsemeat means European food industry products will come under closer scrutiny than originally anticipated.Sweden's National Food Agency has traced IKEA meat contamination to Swedish food producer Dafgard AB but information about cakes contaminated with intestinal bacteria remains scarce.Ikea has halted meatball sales at its stores in 24 countries but stores in North America and other locations weren't affected.The Polish meat scandal is unfolding, brought to public attention after undercover journalists for TVN24 television network filmed factory staff allegedly accepting "moldy" returns and reusing them in other meat products.Among the scenes captured on camera was one showing a factory employee sifting through meat past sell-by date that had been returned and giving instructions to reuse it in other products, New Poland Express reported on its website.The website cited an exchange between a factory insider and an undercover journalist."A whole leg of pig was returned. It was wrapped in foil and in the middle there was water and it was white with fungus. It was washed and heated up and used as new," the insider allegedly told the television reporter.Polish health authorities have ordered the recall of meat items produced at the closed factory. Stores in Germany, Ireland, Lithuania and the United Kingdom were cited among recipients.Markets in North America or elsewhere weren't mentioned by Poland's food authorities.The factory issued a statement saying it had taken measures to ensure the food it produced is safe and to "reassure anxious consumers that such behavior has no place in the company," New Poland Express reported.The latest incident comes just over a week after Polish inspectors found horse DNA in meat labeled as beef in three Polish meat-processing plants, the BBC said.The Financial Times said Europe's food industry regulation was being tested by the latest crisis. The crisis has "raised questions about whether European regulators are capable of coping with an industry whose ingredients and subcontractors increasingly cross national borders."Critics say the European food regulation is flawed because it doesn't require factories to name the countries that supply the ingredients. Food labeling mentions only the ingredients of a food item.

Bush's first term, a Gallup Poll found.The split between Obama's approval ratings among Democrats and Republicans in 2012, his fourth year in office, was 76 percentage points, matching the split in George W. Bush's fourth year, a Gallup Poll released Thursday said.Obama had an average 86 percent approval rating in his own party and only 10 percent among Republicans during 2012, while 91 percent of Republicans and only 15 percent of Democrats liked Bush in 2004.Bush averaged an approval gap of 61 points during eight years in office, Gallup said. Obama's average gap so far is 70 points."Both Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush, have made overtures toward bringing Americans together," Gallup analyst Jeffrey Jones said. "The reality is that under both of their presidencies, Americans have been more politically divided than ever before. It is not clear how much of that is due to their governing styles and how much is just a reflection on how Americans approach politics and the presidency these days."President Dwight Eisenhower's approval gap averaged 45 points in the 1950s and President Richard Nixon's gap in the late '60s and early '70s was 44 points. Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton both averaged about 60 points.The president with the smallest approval gap, at 29 points, was Jimmy Carter, mostly because fewer Democrats, 53 percent, approved of his performance.

NEW YORK, June 17 (UPI) -- New York City police have increased their presence in some Staten Island areas still effected by Hurricane Sandy in an effort to curb looting, officials said.Police have focused on the neighborhoods Ocean Breeze, Midland Beach and an area of Oakwood around Cedar Grove Beach, which still have vacant homes, the Staten Island Advance reported Monday."We've revamped it now -- we have 10 cars per night in the hurricane zone, and in certain strategic areas where I think it's a good spot, we have officers fixed in their [marked patrol cars]," four in total, Deputy Inspector Joseph Veneziano said. "And I want them to stay right there to see who's coming and going from the neighborhood."With that I think we have the neighborhood covered pretty well. I mean, nothing is ever foolproof ... . We can always change our plan, put people in different places."The new security measures came in response to a series of break-ins Ocean Breeze and Midland Beach that left some residents setting booby traps. New copper pipes and construction tools have been among items stolen."We figure we have it solved. We have the collars, we have people arrested on what we think was the pattern of burglaries going on," Veneziano said. "But then the very next week we get hit again in the Ocean Breeze area, and this time they weren't taking the copper pipe, they were taking the tools basically from contractors who were working in the area."

DNA matches and facial sketches have helped the police agency identify 252 victims thus far, the online newspaper Japan Today reported.

Wiki
Miranda Leigh Lambert (born November 10, 1983) is an American country music/Texas Country artist who gained fame as a finalist on the 2003 season of Nashville Star, where she finished in third place and later signed to Epic Records. Lambert made her debut with the release of "Me and Charlie Talking", the first single from her 2005 debut album Kerosene. This album, which was certified Platinum in the United States, also produced the singles "Bring Me Down", "Kerosene", and "New Strings". All four singles were Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts.
After Epic's Nashville division closed, Lambert was transferred to Columbia Records Nashville for her second album, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which was released in early 2007. Although the title track failed to make top 40, the next three singles ("Famous in a Small Town", "Gunpowder & Lead", and "More Like Her") were all Top 20 hits, with "Gunpowder & Lead" becoming her first Top 10 country hit in July 2008. Lambert's third album, Revolution, was released in September 2009. Five singles have been released from the album, including Lambert's two Number One hits "The House That Built Me," which spent four weeks at the top of the chart, and "Heart Like Mine". Lambert has also been honored by the Grammy Awards, the Academy of Country Music Awards, and the Country Music Association Awards.
Miranda Leigh Lambert was born November 10, 1983 in Longview, Texas and raised in Lindale, Texas. Her father, Richard Lee "Rick" Lambert, is a retired police officer who in later life became a private investigator in partnership with her mother, Beverly June Lambert (née Hughes). Miranda was taught about guns by her father at an early age and later became an avid deer hunter. Her parents took her to a Garth Brooks concert when she was nine and this started her interest in country music. Her father wrote and performed country music and she soon began singing in talent contests under his tutelage.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
