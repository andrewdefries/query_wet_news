LONDON, Nov. 26 (UPI) -- British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced Monday the next Bank of England governor would be Mark Carney, head of the Bank of Canada.It is the first time Britain has decided to hand the leadership role at the bank to a foreigner, The New York Times reported. The surprise move also comes as the BOE takes over the role of Britain's top regulator for banking, making the move a critical appointment.The current regulating body, the Financial Services Authority, is closing in 2013. Current bank Gov. Mervyn King, meanwhile, is resigning in July."This is a new job. Previously, the focus was mainly on monetary policy. Now it is about financial stability, monetary policy and macro-prudential policy. The key is to get the right mix of policy and making sure there is proper coordination [with the Exchequer]," said said Simon Hayes, an economist at Barclays. The Exchequer is the British equivalent of the U.S. Treasury Department.Many had expected the government to pick BOE Deputy Gov. Paul Tucker to take over King's job. That promotion may have been scrapped after emails between Tucker and Barclays bank Chief Executive Officer Robert Diamond Jr. surfaced showing discussions on the London inter-bank exchange rate or Libor. The emails suggest Tucker may have agreed that the rate should be suppressed, the Times said.Barclays has agreed to pay a $450 million fine to settle charges that it manipulated the Libor, a scandal that has turned into an even wider investigation of other banks that may have attempted to do the same.

SAO PAULO, Dec. 5 (UPI) -- Argentina is on track to buy 14 Brazilian Guarani 6x6 armored vehicles being developed with Italian manufacturer Iveco's help.Details of the defense deal weren't released but confirmation of the planned procurement by the Argentine army comes from Brazilian army Brig. Gen. Philip Linhares Luiz Gomes, head of research in Brazil's land forces.The 6x6 VBTP-MR Guarani armored vehicle is the result of Brazil's collaboration over several years with Italy's Iveco S.p.A.Argentine procurement officials apparently decided on the purchase after trials of the armored vehicle during military exercises.Argentina is the first foreign customer for the Guarani but Brazilian officials have indicated they are keen to expand the market for the APC while deploying an unspecified number of units in various branches of Brazilian armed forces.The six-wheel Guarani Viatura Blindada Transporte de Pessoal, Media de Rodas, or VBTP-MR, is envisaged as a military vehicle family that can replace Brazilian inventories of Engesa EE-11 and EE-9 wheeled vehicles. Both vehicles and related equipment were caught in a time-warp amid Brazil's troubles with keeping its defense program on track after the end of military dictatorship and switch to democratic rule. Engesa went into bankruptcy in 1993.Brazil has invested tens of billions of dollars in regenerating its shipyards and civilian and defense aviation industries. Commercial and defense aviation major Embraer is developing new tactical transport aircraft as part of that overall strategy and plans are afoot to build capacity for commercial and military helicopters.Brazil's previously profitable defense vehicle industry suffered a major setback when demand for its products collapsed with the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988, bringing bankruptcies and ruin to Brazilian companies involved with the business.The second Gulf War in 1990-91 and the shift to U.S.-supplied weapons in the battle zone decisively removed Brazil as a major supplier to the region.Iveco, which has a wide customer base in Latin America, has been a partner to Brazilian companies in commercial transport vehicles.A $3.2 billion contract gave the company a new start in Brazil to develop armored wheeled vehicles that could replace the obsolete EE-11 and EE-9 APCs marketed by Engesa before its bankruptcy.Brazil's aims are two-fold: to modernize the army and lay the foundations for a robust, regenerated heavy vehicle industry.The Iveco contract, signed in December 2009, will enable Brazil to renew its wheeled armored personnel carrier fleet and also facilitate access to new technologies as part of the plan to regenerate the local military vehicle industry.The 6×6 Guarani is designed to replace both EE-11 and EE-9, which are increasingly harder to operate because of shortage of spares and questions about the vehicles' protection levels.Brazil hopes the VBTP-MR can be developed to a level where it can replace both of the outmoded vehicles in Brazilian military service.The defense vehicles are being developed through the Iveco Fiat Oto Melara joint venture.The 20-ton VBTP-MR will likely have amphibious capacity and be powered by a FPT diesel engine coupled to an automatic gearbox.The VBTP-MR will be able to carry a crew of 10 dismounts excluding the driver and will fit into a C-130 Hercules or the planned Brazilian KC-390 transport aircraft, increasingly seen as a rival to the C-130 range.Brazil's recent contracts with foreign suppliers indicate the new APC will come a variety of remote-controlled weapon stations, guns and cannons, including Israeli manufacturer Elbit's ORCWS UT-30BR, and anti-tank missiles.The Guarani also offers Iveco an attractive prospect of developing a new market in addition to its new Puma six-wheel and four-wheel armored personnel carriers.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, July 16 (UPI) -- The United Service Organization confirmed TV star Charlie Sheen has pledged to donate at least $1 million to help support injured troops and their families.CNN said Monday Sheen's donation will be based on 1 percent of the profits from his new sitcom "Anger Management" and will be at least $1 million."It's an honor for me to be able to give back to these men and women of the military who have done so much for all of us," Sheen said in a statement. "They put their lives on the line for us every day, and I'm just happy that my work on 'Anger Management' can bring a little bit of relief to the troops and their families."The donation will go toward the USO's Operation Enduring Care campaign, which supports injured troops and their families, Gena Fitzgerald, vice president of communications for the group, told CNN."His support is greatly appreciated, especially from our wounded warriors and their families," said John Pray Jr., a retired Air Force brigadier general and the USO's executive vice president.

MECHANICSBURG, Ohio, Jan. 31 (UPI) -- The family of an Ohio man being buried atop his motorcycle in a transparent casket said the burial plan was made about 18 years ago.The family of Mechanicsburg resident Billy Standley, who died from lung cancer Sunday at age 82, said the man long ago began making arrangements to be buried in a Plexiglas casket while astride his 1967 Harley Davidson Electra Glide, the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News reported Friday.Roy Standley, one of Billy's four children, said he and brother Pete built the casket with a reinforced bottom for their father and it stayed in his garage for the past five years."If you stopped by his house, he showed you his casket," Roy Standley said. "He was proud of it."Billy Standley purchased three extra burial plots at Fairview Cemetery in Mutual years ago to accommodate his big burial plans, which were to be carried out Friday."He'd done right by us all these years, and at least we could see he goes out the way he wanted to," Pete Standley said.

Johnson wins another Cy Young awardNEW YORK, Nov. 6 (UPI) -- Arizona Diamondbacks lefthander Randy Johnson received all 32 first-place votes from the Baseball Writers Association of America and Tuesday captured the highest honor in pitching for the fourth straight season.The only other pitcher to win the Cy Young award four straight seasons was Atlanta Braves righthander Greg Maddux (1992-95). Maddux also was the last unanimous selection in 1995.Johnson, 39, went 24-5 with a 2.32 ERA in 35 starts, and is the fourth-oldest Cy Young Award winner ever. He had eight complete games, including four shutouts, and struck out 334 batters in 260 innings.One of the hardest throwers in history, Johnson led the league in wins, ERA and strikeouts, held opponents to a .208 batting average, and nearly was unbeatable following an Arizona loss. For good measure, he went 5-0 with a 0.66 ERA in September.The 6-10 southpaw also won the American League Cy Young Award with the Seattle Mariners in 1995. Only Roger Clemens, who won his sixth Cy Young Award last year, has more.Johnson's teammate, Curt Schilling, was the runner-up, receiving 29 second-place votes.Schilling, who turns 36 on Nov. 14, was 23-7 with a 3.23 ERA in 35 starts. He completed just five games and only had one shutout, but posted a remarkable walk-to-strikeout ratio of 33-to-316. The veteran righthander was 11-2 in the division, and held opponents to a .224 batting average.As good as he was, Schilling had a rough finish, giving up 18 runs in his final three appearances, enabling Johnson to pull away.John Smoltz, who made a stunning 18-month transformation from frontline starter to All-Star closer, received one second-place vote and was third overall in the voting.The 35-year-old righthander set an NL record with 55 saves, blowing just four this season. He posted a 3.25 ERA and held opponents to a .206 batting average. He was spectacular in thesecond half, going 2-0 with a 1.42 ERA, and 24 saves in 25 opportunities.Closer Eric Gagne of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Roy Oswalt of the Houston Astros tied for fourth, and Bartolo Colon of the Montreal Expos received one third-place vote.Russian Tatiana Panova rolls in first round PATTAYA, Thailand, Nov. 6 (UPI) -- Top seed Tatiana Panova of Russia, seeking her first career title, cruised Tuesday into the second round of the Volvo Women's Open by routing qualifier and counrtywoman Maria Kirilenko, 6-1, 6-0.The 26-year-old Panova reached the finals at Auckland and Sarasota and advanced to the third round at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.Russian Anastassia Rodionova recorded the first upset in this Tier V hardcourt tournament, defeating German fourth-seed Anca Barna, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.Frenchwoman Stephanie Cohen Aloro ousted Yuliana Fedak 6-1, 7-5, in a matchup of qualifiers and lucky loser Sandra Kleinova of the Czech Republic cruised past Julia Vakulenko of Ukraine, 6-3, 6-3.In the only other matches Tuesday, Japan's Shinobu Asagoe beat Russian Olga Kalyuzhnaya, 6-3, 6-1; and Poland's Magdalena Grzybowska overcame Libuse Prusova of the Czech Republic, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. Red Sox re-sign LHP Alan EmbreeBOSTON, Nov. 6 (UPI) -- The Boston Red Sox made sure Alan Embree never reached the free agent market, signing the lefthander Tuesday to a two-year contract with a club option for a third season."I'm really excited to be here in Boston," said Embree, who was acquired from San Diego on June 23. "Everybody made it real easy for me to come back.

BATON ROUGE, La., Dec. 4 (UPI) -- Louisiana State senior quarterback Zach Mettenberger is injured and will miss the Tigers' upcoming bowl game, head Coach Les Miles said Wednesday.Miles wouldn't disclose the nature of Mettenberger's injury, but ESPN reported he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, as well a sprained medial collateral ligament in the same knee.The injury happened during the Tigers' 31-27 victory last week over Arkansas when he was pinned under a defender."We are very disappointed for Zach," Miles said. "He's been a tremendous leader for our team and he's as competitive a guy as I have ever been around. He's had a great impact on our program."In his final season with LSU, Mettenberger compiled 3,082 passing yards with 22 touchdowns and eight interceptions.

BAGHDAD, Dec. 5 (UPI) -- The Iraqi government has stopped an airliner carrying Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz landing in Iraqi Kurdistan amid Baghdad's deepening rift with Ankara over its support Iraq's independence-minded Kurds.The Kurds, who have a semiautonomous enclave in northern Iraq, are locked in a tense confrontation with Iraqi troops in the region because of long-simmering disputes over land and oil.Ankara's backing for the Kurdistan Regional Government, whose territory contains an estimated 45 billion barrels of oil and 211 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, threatens a showdown with the Turks that could inflame tensions with Syria and Iran in a region already torn by war.The decision Tuesday by the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to refuse Yildiz's aircraft permission to land at Erbil, the Kurdish capital, imposed greater strains on Baghdad's relations with the Turks at a critical juncture.Yildiz was heading to Erbil to attend the closing session of a Kurdistan oil and gas conference intended to accelerate the enclave's drive to establish its own energy industry operating independently of the central government, a move Baghdad clearly found offensive.The Kurdish Regional Government in Erbil has signed exploration deals with oil majors like Exxon Mobil and Chevron of the United States, Total of France, and Gazprom of Russia, along with some 40 smaller foreign companies.Baghdad refuses to recognize the contracts, branding them illegal. The KRG's deals with Exxon and the other majors are likely to end their investment in Iraq's mega oil fields in the south.Other majors, particularly Chinese companies, are eager to take their place in boosting Iraq's oil production but the defections were a bitter humiliation for Baghdad and could set back its ambitious oil strategy.This dispute with Baghdad, over oil rights and revenue-sharing, is only one component of the multilayered rift between Erbil and Baghdad, but the banning of Yildiz's aircraft reflects the growing tensions between the KRG and the federal government as well between Iraq and Turkey.Baghdad was incensed in August after Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu made an unannounced visit to the flashpoint city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds claim is part of their territory along with its oilfields, without informing Baghdad.Kirkuk "is a red line for the Kurds," observed Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis group. "The Kurds will never give up the city."Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants to make his country into the energy hub between east and west, which is why it's dealing directly with the KRG.It's offered to build oil and gas pipelines from landlocked Kurdistan to its Mediterranean export terminals, allowing the Kurds to bypass Baghdad's pipeline network.In recent weeks, Maliki and Erdogan have engaged in a war of words, accusing each other of pushing their countries toward conflict.Erdogan has also given sanctuary to Iraq's fugitive vice president, Tariq al-Hashemi, a minority Sunni who has been sentenced to death in absentia by a Baghdad court on charges of murder and treason against Maliki's Shiite-controlled government. He denies the charges and says he was framed by Maliki, who's widely seen to be accumulating dictatorial powers following the U.S. military withdrawal in December 2011.Baghdad's refusal to relinquish Kirkuk, traditionally a Kurdish city that Saddam Hussein sought to Arabize by forcibly driving out Kurdish inhabitants, has long been a powder keg waiting to explode.Amid the growing tension between Baghdad and Erbil, there are concerns it could explode and touch off a shooting war between Iraq's Shiite majority and the Sunni Kurds, amid the wider sectarian strains.The trigger could come from a standoff between battle-seasoned Kurdish fighters known as peshmerga -- "those who face death" -- and Maliki's mainly Shiite forces in disputed territory in northern Iraq.Kurdish leaders want to expand their semiautonomous enclave across territory stretching from Iraq's eastern border to with Iran to the western frontier with Syria, a predominantly Kurdish region that also contains most of Syria's oil reserves.This has raised suspicions the Iraqi Kurds may be seeking to establish a wider Kurdish state embracing Syria's Kurds, and energy resources, should war-torn Syria fragment.Maliki warned Saturday of the danger of "ethnic conflict" after efforts to ease tension stalled. Baghdad refused to dismantle the newly established Tigris Operations Command that covers disputed territory in Kirkuk, Salaheddin and Diyala provinces in the north.

GREENSBURG, Pa., Feb. 6 (UPI) -- A neighbor testified Wednesday she heard "slamming" from the apartment above where a mentally challenged Pennsylvania woman was allegedly held captive. Floria Headen was on the stand during the third day of Ricky Smyrnes' capital murder trial in Greensburg, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported. Smyrnes, 26, formerly of Irwin and McKeesport, was allegedly the ringleader in the torture and death of Jennifer Daugherty, 30, a mentally challenged Mount Pleasant woman. "I heard something on the floor like somebody was slamming the body onto the floor," Headen told a Westmoreland County jury. Daugherty's body was found stuffed into a trash can under a truck in the parking lot at the Greensburg Salem Middle School in February 2010. Prosecutors allege Smyrnes, who could face the death penalty if convicted, and his five roommates held her prisoner in their Greensburg apartment, tortured her and then killed her. Greensburg Detective Jerry Vernail testified Tuesday Smyrnes went up to investigators after the body was found and asked "What's going on?" Smyrnes and his girlfriend, Angela Marinucci, appeared to have no concern about Daugherty, Vernail said. Two people have already been convicted and sentenced, Melvin Knight, 23, to death and Marinucci, 20, to life in prison. Amber Meidinger, 23, has already testified for the prosecution against Knight and Marinucci and is likely to testify at Smyrnes' trial. Two other defendants have been trying to negotiate plea agreements.

Thomas Edward John Jr. (born May 22, 1943) is a former left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball whose 288 career victories rank as the seventh highest total among left-handers in major league history. He is also known for the revolutionary surgery, now named after him, which was performed on a damaged ligament in his pitching arm.
An outstanding basketball player at Gerstmeyer High School in Terre Haute, where he held the city single game scoring record, John was originally signed by the Cleveland Indians, making his major league debut in 1963. John chose baseball when he realized he had the most talent in it and would not go on to play professional basketball. Of his 26-year major league career, he is best remembered for his seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1970s. He made appearances in the All-Star Game in 1968, 1978, 1979, and 1980. He played in all three Yankees vs. Dodgers World Series of his era (1977, 1978 and 1981), but was on the losing end of all three, having switched over to the Yankees by the time the Dodgers took the Series in 1981. John never played on a major league championship team. John was a soft throwing sinkerball pitcher whose technique resulted in batters hitting numerous ground balls and induced double plays.
In the middle of the 1974 season, John was cruising along with a 13-3 record as the Dodgers were en route to their first National League pennant in eight years, before he permanently damaged the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching arm, leading to a revolutionary surgical operation. This operation, now known as Tommy John surgery, replaced the ligament in the elbow of his pitching arm with a tendon from his right forearm. The surgery was performed by Dr. Frank Jobe on September 25, 1974, and although it seemed unlikely he would ever be able to pitch again, he spent the entire 1975 season in recovery. John would work with team mate and major league pitcher Mike Marshall who was said to know how to help pitchers recover from injuries and taught John a completely different way to pitch where he would not turn his leg and go straight to the plate which eliminated the chance of him hurting his knee and arm, and he returned to the Dodgers in 1976. His 10-10 record that year was considered "miraculous" but John went on to pitch until 1989, winning 164 games after his surgery—one fewer game than all-time great Sandy Koufax won in his entire career. After Phil Niekro's retirement, John spent 1988 and 1989 as the oldest player in the major leagues. In 1989, Tommy John matched Deacon McGuire’s record (since broken) for most seasons played in a Major League Baseball career with 26 seasons played. Today, many pitchers have Tommy John surgery during their careers.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
