RESTON, Va., Dec. 19 (UPI) -- Changing weather patterns are forcing plant and animal species to interact in ways that may be incompatible, a U.S. climate report finds.A report led by U.S. Geological Survey -- "Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity, Ecosystems, and Ecosystem Services" -- says animal and plant species are flowering, laying eggs or migrating in different ways and at different times than in previous years. This pattern, the USGS said, is accelerating."These geographic range and timing changes are causing cascading effects that extend through ecosystems, bringing together species that haven't previously interacted and creating mismatches between animals and their food sources," Nancy Grimm, an ecologist at Arizona State University and a lead author of the report, said in a statement.The report warns that ecological imbalances may lead to sweeping changes in biodiversity. If, for example, insects emerge before migrating birds arrive, bird populations may decline. This could spill over to ecosystems like coastal areas in ways that may impact the human population.Some parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change who met recently in Doha agreed to extend the Kyoto Protocol and move ahead with plans for a new climate treaty after 2020.Several reports released ahead of the climate talks suggested weather may grow more extreme even if world governments met existing emissions goals, however.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Aug. 27 (UPI) -- U.S. healthcare prices grew 1.1 percent in July compared to July 2012, only a tenth above the May rate, the lowest since January 1990, a non-profit group says.The data comes from the monthly Health Sector Economic Indicators briefs released by Altarum Institute's Center for Sustainable Health Spending. The 12-month moving average -- at 1.6 percent -- represents a new low for the data, the Altarum Institute said. National health expenditures grew 4.3 percent in June, and spending growth averaged 4.1 percent for the first half of the year, barely above the record low levels seen annually since 2009. The share of the U.S. economy devoted to healthcare is now averaging 17.4 percent in the post-recession period, and Altarum estimates a reading of 17.5 percent for June 2013. Healthcare employment rose by only 2,500 jobs in July, well below the 24-month average of 22,000, and the lowest increase since July 2003. Ambulatory care settings added jobs, but hospitals lost 13,000 jobs over the past three months. "The benchmark revisions affecting data going all the way back to 1929 leave a lot to digest, but our indicators show near record low price growth, continued restrained national health spending, and new health employment data at long last reflecting the health expenditure slowdown," said Ani Turner, deputy director of the Altarum Institute's Center for Sustainable Health Spending.

NEW YORK, July 14 (UPI) -- Animal control authorities said a American bulldog mix that boarded a Staten Island, N.Y., bus is the long-lost pet of Florida man. The 4-year-old dog was not wearing a collar when it got on the bus early Wednesday morning and made herself comfortable on one of the benches, the New York Daily News said. The bus operator contacted police, who brought the dog to Staten Island's animal shelter. A microchip was embedded under the dog's fur, but didn't have any information on it because it was never registered, the Daily News said.But an animal rescuer contacted the manufacturer of the chip and discovered Michael Kanaskie, of Hollywood, Fla., purchased the device more than two years ago.Kanaskie said he had given up looking for the dog, named Marly, after his former spouse gave her away without his permission. "My birthday is tomorrow," Kanaskie said. "This is the greatest gift for my birthday."

| License Photo	OXFORD, Miss., Sept. 27 (UPI) -- U.S. presidential rivals John McCain and Barack Obama sparred in their debate Friday over former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's view on talks with Iran.Obama, the Democrat, said Kissinger favored talking with Iran without preconditions. McCain, the Republican, challenged the assertion.Kissinger -- who is an adviser to McCain -- said at a CNN seminar in Washington this month that he favored high-level talks, likely at the secretary of state level, but was less specific about the pre-conditions that McCain and Obama were at odds over Friday night.Kissinger's quote, CNN said, was that the United States needed to engage Tehran at a high level."One utility of negotiation is to put before Iran our vision of a Middle East, of a stable Middle East, and our notion on nuclear proliferation at a high enough level so that they have to study it," Kissinger said. "And, therefore, I actually have preferred doing it at the secretary of state level."

NEW YORK, Sept. 26 (UPI) -- A New York nurse practitioner says in a lawsuit an organ transplant group pressured hospital staffers to declare patients brain-dead for faster harvesting.The lawsuit by U.S. Air Force combat veteran and nurse practitioner Patrick McMahon, 50, filed Tuesday in Manhattan Supreme Court, claims the New York Organ Donor Network fired him as a transplant coordinator after four months for protesting the practice of persuading hospital personnel to speed decisions so body parts could be obtained, the New York Post reported Wednesday.McMahon's suit cites four examples of improper organ harvesting, including a 19-year-old man admitted in 2011 to Nassau University Medical Center after a car accident. The man was still trying to breathe and showed signs of brain activity, the suit charges, but was declared brain-dead by doctors after pressure from network officials, including director Michael Goldstein, who allegedly said during a conference call, "This kid is dead, you got that?"The suit also says "coaches" were hired to train network staffers to be more persuasive about organ donation when speaking with grieving families."I have been in Desert Storm, Iraq and Afghanistan in combat. I worked on massive brain injuries, trauma, gunshot wounds, IEDs. I have seen worse cases than this and the victims recover," McMahon said of the car accident victim.

NEW YORK, Feb. 21 (UPI) -- New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's said his administration is removing children from two homeless shelters with poor heating, bad food and other problems.More than 400 children and their families have been transferred out of the Auburn Family Residence in Brooklyn and the Catherine Street shelter in Lower Manhattan, the New York Times reported.The administration will be converting the two facilities into adult family shelters and will be finding other housing for the displaced families, officials said.Inspectors have reported that the two shelters have cockroaches, insufficient heat, spoiled food and other problems, including violence."Until today, no mayor was willing to say no children should be treated this way, and that's a historic breakthrough," said attorney Steven Banks at the Legal Aid Society, which has fought the city over shelter conditions. Auburn has been cited for more than 400 violations.Catherine Street has had at least 150 violations since 2006.The city has set a hearing on family shelters for next week. The transition plan, which includes enhanced security measures and upgrades to both facilities, will cost the city more than $13 million.

PRAIA DA LUZ, Portugal, Feb. 17 (UPI) -- The widow of a suspect in the disappearance of British girl Madeleine McCann said Portuguese police questioned her -- four years after her husband's death.Luisa Rodrigues said she was quizzed about mobile phone records that indicated her husband, Euclides Lopes Monteiro, was at the scene of Gerry and Kate McCanns' hotel room the night their 4-year-old daughter disappeared, Britain's Mirror reported Monday.The report didn't say exactly when the widow was questioned.Monteiro died four years ago in a tractor accident, two years after Madeleine disappeared from her parents' hotel room in Portugal."They said they suspected him because he used to work at the Ocean Club complex where the McCanns were staying and because they had tracked the signal from his mobile phone to the area where Madeleine disappeared the night she vanished," Rodrigues said. "I was speechless. I kept repeating Euclides was innocent but they said it was not for me to say."British cold-case detectives said they're anxious to track down three of Monteiro's known associates who they said carried out burglaries in the area where McCann was allegedly abducted.
