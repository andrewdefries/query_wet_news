LONDON, April 26 (UPI) -- The British government said it was allocating as much as $96 million to back carbon capture and storage technology in developing countries."We recognize that it is important to ensure CCS is deployed in developing as well as developed countries," British Climate Change Minister Greg Barker said in a statement. "The funding that the U.K. has committed today will support the development of new partnerships and capacity building activities in emerging markets."The International Energy Agency said CCS technology could cut carbon dioxide emissions from the industrial sector as much as 4 gigatons by the middle of the century.In a report with the U.N. Industrial Development Organization, the IEA said more than 1,800 large-scale CCS projects are needed in the next 40 years, however.The commitment announced by the British government contributes to the $200 million recommended by a CCS action group."To tackle climate change, it is essential that CCS is deployed on a global scale both in power and industrial sectors," Jeff Chapman, the top executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said in a statement.

LA CORUNA, Spain, Sept. 17 (UPI) -- Spanish authorities say someone who bought a lottery ticket that won a $6.3 million jackpot last year dropped it on the counter immediately after purchase.The ticket was turned in by the man who found it, and officials are now trying to locate the buyer, TheLocal.es reported. The only person to come forward so far was making a false claim, police in Galicia say. Few details have been released about the person being sought because officials want to discourage other cheats. They have said only that he or she was probably a regular at the store in La Coruna in northwestern Spain where the ticket was bought. The ticket, with the numbers 10, 17, 24, 37, 40 and 43, was bought for the drawing on June 30, 2012, and won the 4.7 million euro ($6.3 million) jackpot. If no genuine claimant comes forward within two years, the finder, identified by the newspaper La Voz de Galicia as Manuel Reija Gonzalez, will get the prize.

| License Photo	ST. LOUIS, Oct. 20 (UPI) -- The speed of Ian Kinsler and Elvis Andrus created two ninth-inning runs Thursday that rallied Texas to a 2-1 win over St. Louis and deadlocked the World Series.Josh Hamilton and Michael Young drove in the runs in the ninth with sacrifice flies, turning what appeared likely to be a two-game lead for the Cardinals into an even series heading back to Texas, where the Rangers will host the next three games, beginning Saturday with Game 3.Texas, which avoided what would have been its first two-game losing streak in almost two months, managed only three hits through the first eight innings and was facing Jason Motte in the ninth.Motte had five playoff saves this season in five opportunities and was working in chilled weather that had helped silenced the Texas bats.Kinsler, however, reached on an infield single to open the ninth and stole second while Andrus was at the plate. Kinsler's hand barely reached the second base bag ahead of the throw from catcher Yadier Molina.Andrus then singled to center with Kinsler holding at third and when the throw back to the infield slipped past the cutoff man Andrus dashed to second.St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa, praised for his handling of the St. Louis bullpen in the 3-2 St. Louis win to open the series, then lifted Motte for Arthur Rhodes. Hamilton hit the first pitch from Rhodes to medium deep right field and Kinsler easily scored the tying run.Andrus moved to third on the Hamilton fly ball and scored with ease when Young lifted a fly ball to right off Lance Lynn, who had come in to replace Rhodes.Neftali Feliz worked the bottom of the ninth and shook off a leadoff walk to Molina to strike out Nick Punto and Skip Schumaker before getting Rafael Furcal on a fly ball to end the game.The win went to Mike Adams, who stranded two runners in the eighth during his only inning of work. St. Louis left nine runners on base overall.Until the Texas comeback, Allen Craig had put himself in position to be a hero for the second straight night. Craig, who drove in the game-winning run in the series opener, singled in the only Cardinals' run in Game 2.Thursday's game was played in temperatures that dropped through the 40s -- heading toward the likelihood of overnight frost in the St. Louis area. Temperatures are forecast to be in the 80s in Arlington during the weekend despite the chance of rain.Hamilton and Young, who drove in the runs in the ninth, were a combined 1-for-14 in the first two games of the series. St. Louis star Albert Pujols is 0-for-5 with a run scored.

NEW YORK, Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Human Rights Watch said there's not much competition in selecting countries to the U.N. Human Rights Council, which lessens the body's influence.The United States, Germany and Ireland were elected to serve three-year terms on the Human Rights Council by the General Assembly."We took the decision that we could improve the work of the Human Rights Council by working within it rather than staying on the outside, and today the international community reaffirmed that it agrees with that judgment," said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice.Human Rights Watch, however, said only three of the 18 seats open on the council were competitive."To call the vote in the General Assembly an 'election' gives this process way too much credit," said Peggy Hicks, global advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement. "Until there is real competition for seats in the Human Rights Council, its membership standards will remain more rhetoric than reality."Hicks' organization expressed further frustration that countries like Pakistan and Ivory Coast were given seats on the U.N. council despite their less-than-exemplary records on human rights.

NEW YORK, Jan. 22 (UPI) -- The 15-member U.N. Security Council, voting unanimously, tightened existing sanctions against North Korea for its long-range rocket launch last month.The council members acted quickly after receiving a draft resolution reached by the United States and China in response to North Korea's Dec. 12 rocket launch in violation of existing U.N. sanctions imposed after the Communist country's earlier missile and two nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.The North had claimed the December launch was to place a satellite in orbit, but it was strongly condemned by the United Nations and Western nations who saw it as a coverup to test the North's intercontinental ballistic missile capability.On Tuesday, the Security Council reiterated its "condemnation" of the North's December "missile launch" and "more sharply targeted sanctions on that country, while again demanding an end to its nuclear and ballistic tests," U.N. News said.The tightened sanctions would include new travel bans and asset freezes on numerous individual North Koreans including officials of North Korea's missile launch facility and the satellite control center, and a banking official involved in the construction of the missile. Companies and committees involved in the rocket launch were also included in the asset freeze. The council called on member states to exercise "enhanced vigilance" in preventing the transfer of funds related to North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programs. The resolution directed the U.N. sanctions committee to issue notices when vessel operators refuse to undergo inspection for cargo being imported into North Korea and also specified how nations may dispose of embargoed items when they are confiscated.In condemning the North's Dec. 12 rocket launch, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had said it was undertaken over the objections of the international community and in clear violation of Security Council Resolution 1874 (2009), which demanded the North not conduct any launch using ballistic missile technology.Resolution 1874 was imposed after North Korea refused to heed demands against conducting any further nuclear or missile tests.In Tuesday's resolution, the council also said it reaffirmed its desire for a peaceful, diplomatic solution to the situation and called for the resumption of stalled six-party talks on the North's denuclearization. The six nations in the talks include the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States.Further talks have not been held after North Korea walked away in April 2009 over U.N. criticism of its similar rocket launch.Welcoming the adoption of the new resolution, Ban in a statement said, "Speaking with one voice, the Security Council reiterated its firm stance that (North Korea's) pursuit of nuclear weapons, including means of delivery, is unacceptable." He urged the North to refrain from taking any measures that could exacerbate tensions on the Korean peninsula, including any further launches that use ballistic missile technology or a nuclear test.Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the resolution is a firm, united and appropriate response to "North Korea's reckless act, and that strict enforcement of sanctions is essential to address the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs," Voice of America reported.The support of China for the resolution was crucial as it is a close ally of North Korea and is also one of the five permanent members of the Security Council with veto power.China's U.N. Ambassador Li Baodong welcomed adoption of the resolution and urged the parties to use it to make progress on the political and diplomatic fronts and avoid an escalation of tension on the Korean peninsula."The message is very strong and clear from this resolution. That is, all stakeholders should work together, should talk to each other, and address concerns to consultations and to have early resumption of six-party talks," Li was quoted as saying.

QUITO, Ecuador, Aug. 18 (UPI) -- Ecuador is painting Britain as a neo-colonialist bully after London threatened to storm the country's embassy to seize WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.British officials want to enforce an extradition warrant against Assange, who was given refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London June 19, the International Herald Tribune reported.Assange is wanted in Sweden on sexual assault charges and in the United States for publishing thousands of top-secret documents."We are not a British colony," Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said in response to the threat.Some Latin American countries are still agitated by what they view as British neo-colonialism when British forces invaded the Falkland Islands in 1982 after Argentine forces landed on the islands in a territorial dispute.The threatened raid on the embassy was a likely topic for members of the Union of South American Nations, which was scheduled to meet Sunday in the Ecuadorian city of Guayaquil.The Alianza Bolivariana, a socialist organization active in Ecuador, Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua and Bolivia, issued a statement rejecting the threat ahead of a meeting of the group's officials Saturday.

| License Photo	Jan. 23 (UPI) -- Hillary Clinton obviously feels passionately about her responsibility to American personnel abroad, choking up a little during her testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday morning. But Clinton looked furious when a senator later questioned Clinton's immediate response to the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and accused her of making excuses for not contacting U.S. diplomats. "I realize that's a good excuse," Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, when Clinton said she didn't think it was "appropriate" to interfere with the FBI's process of conducting interviews with diplomatic staff. "No, it's a fact," Clinton responded."With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans," she said. Was it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions about this. But he fact is that people were trying, in real time, to get to the best information.

Wiki
Sean John Combs (born November 4, 1969), also known by his stage name Diddy or P. Diddy, is an American rapper, singer, record producer, actor, and businessman. He has won three Grammy Awards and two MTV Video Music Awards, and his clothing line earned a Council of Fashion Designers of America award. He was originally known as Puff Daddy and then as P. Diddy (Puff and Puffy being often used as a nickname, but never as recording names). In August 2005, he changed his stage name to simply "Diddy", but continues to use the name P. Diddy in the United Kingdom as the result of a lawsuit. He formed and recorded with the group "Diddy - Dirty Money".
Combs was born in Harlem and grew up in Mount Vernon, New York. He worked as a talent director at Uptown Records and then founded Bad Boy Records in 1993. His business interests under the umbrella of Bad Boy Entertainment Worldwide include Bad Boy Records; the clothing lines Sean John & Sean by Sean Combs; a movie production company; and two restaurants. He has taken the roles of recording executive, performer, producer of MTV's Making the Band, writer, arranger, clothing designer, and Broadway actor. In 2011 Forbes estimated his net worth at $475 million, making him the richest figure in hip hop.
Sean Combs was born in a public housing project in Harlem, New York, the son of Janice, a model and teacher, and Melvin Earl Combs. He grew up in Mount Vernon, New York. When Combs was a child, his father, aged 33, an associate of Frank Lucas (the New York drug lord), was shot to death in his car at a Manhattan park after attending a party. Lucas and rival gangster Nicky Barnes both publicly state that they were close to Melvin.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
