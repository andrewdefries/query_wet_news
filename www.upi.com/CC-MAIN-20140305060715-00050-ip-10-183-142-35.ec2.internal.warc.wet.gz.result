TRIPOLI, Libya, Jan. 3 (UPI) -- Amid the political upheaval of the dictator-toppling uprisings across the Arab world over the last two years, North African states are driving to open their energy sectors to foreign investment and boost oil and natural gas production.Global energy giants are seeking to seize economic opportunities that are emerging from the political upheaval of the Arab Spring as new, more accountable governments take their place."It was the big finds in the Eastern Mediterranean that fundamentally changed the industry's view of the region" in 2009-11, the Financial Times observed.The turmoil continues, especially in North Africa, as the Arab Spring turns to the Arab Winter with pro-democracy revolutions struggling to find their feet.But, says Bill Higgs, chief executive officer of exploration firm Mediterranean Oil & Gas, "There are a lot more opportunities than there were before the Arab Spring in places like Egypt, Libya and Tunisia."However, as new governments emerge along the North African littoral, the oil and gas reserves of Algeria, Libya and Egypt are being opened to an unprecedented degree.Even Morocco and Tunisia, bypassed by oilmen over the years, are likely to be part of the hydrocarbons boom sweeping the region.Tunisia and neighboring Libya, both struggling to emerge from dramatic regime changes that are still unfolding, are set to jointly develop a 678,000-acre offshore oil field in the Gulf of Gabes where their maritime borders converge.The block, where exploration will be conducted by the Canadian energy company Sonde, includes the El Bouri field in Libyan waters and Tunisia's Ashtart and Miskar fields.In Egypt, BP is due to initiate deep-water natural gas exploration in the Mediterranean Basin soon. Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley says BP will invest $10 billion over the next five years.Egypt's proven gas reserves are pegged at 77 tcf, the third highest in Africa after Nigeria and Algeria. BP's offshore project is expected to boost that by 20 percent. BP Egypt announced two new strikes in the Nile Delta in August, raising the area's total to five.In Libya, BP is expected to start its much-delayed deep-water drilling for gas in five blocks in the Gulf of Sidra, a major oil-producing region, this year. It suspended the controversial $900 million program during Libya's 2011 civil war that ended with the death of dictator Moammar Gadhafi.The new government, still grappling with serious security problems, has restored much of Libya's energy infrastructure, damaged or shut down during the conflict. It's almost reached the pre-war production level of 1.6 million barrels per day. But BP's Gulf of Sidra operation is seen as a potential game-changer.Libya's gas reserves are estimated at 53 tcf, the 14th largest in the world. Some analysts say these are closer to 70 trillion-100 trillion tcf.Paolo Scaroni, CEO of Italy's Eni, which has operated in Libya since 1959, says his company plans to invest $8 billion there over the next decade.Eni, which produces about one-third of the former Italian colony's output, is the leading foreign oil and gas producer in Africa.Libya has the continent's largest proven oil reserves of 47.1 billion barrels, mainly on land. It has low production costs and it's close to refineries in Europe, its main customer. But energy sector development was seriously impaired during Gadhafi's erratic 42-year rule.If post-war security is restored -- and that's a big if right now -- production could climb.Even after 50 years of production, Libya's still largely unexplored and the new regime seems determined to exploit its untapped reserves.Algeria, with reserves of 12.2 billion barrels of oil and 159 tcf of gas, has avoided much of the Arab Spring turmoil. But the military-backed government has been forced to introduce major reforms to head off trouble and open up the oil and gas sector, the country's economic mainstay.Although Algeria's a major African producer, it's still considered to be relatively under-explored.State oil company Sonatrach says it will boost a planned investment for its 2012-16 from $62.2 billion to $80 billion and will revise hydrocarbon laws to attract more foreign investors.Sonatrach, which has been badly shaken in a political power struggle, is soon to sign agreements with Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil to develop recoverable shale gas reserves estimated at 600 tcf.

OAKLAND, Calif., May 12 (UPI) -- Employees and public financial documents indicate Family Radio, the evangelical network in Oakland, Calif., may soon be out of business. The non-profit has sold its three largest radio stations and took out a $30 million loan to keep operating while awaiting those sales proceeds, the financial reports indicate. The troubles come after the company spent millions on Family Radio's announcement of Judgment Day, which it predicted to be May 21, 2011. Former and current employers told the Contra Costa (Calif.) Times that the company's donations have dropped by 70 percent since Family Radio's Judgment Day prediction proved incorrect. But board member Tom Evans said that although the non-profit is struggling in the current economy, the company is not closing and the financial problems aren't as serious as some allege. "Sufficient funds were in the bank and, thankfully, we didn't spend everything on May 21, 2011," he told the Times. "But it did force us to make quick changes."

NASHVILLE, Jan. 15 (UPI) -- Young people don't remember better than older adults, but their memories seem better because they retrieve them in higher definition, U.S. researchers say. Study leader Philip Ko and Dr. Brandon Ally, both of Vanderbilt University, said the study involved 11 older adults about age 67 and 13 younger adults of approximately 23 years of age. They had them complete a task called visual change detection, which consisted of viewing two, three or four colored dots and memorizing their appearance. These dots disappeared, and then after a few seconds the participants were presented with a single dot appearing in one of the memorized colors or a new color. The accuracy of their response -- behavioral measure -- was considered to reflect how well they memorized the colors. Electroencephalographic -- the recording of electrical activity along the scalp -- was also collected from the participants as they performed the task for a neural measure of their memory capacity.The study found while behavioral measures indicated a lower capacity in older adults than younger adults to memorize items, the neural measure of memory capacity was very similar in both groups. In other words, during the maintenance stage, both groups stored the same number of items.However, older adults store the items at a lower resolution than younger adults, resulting in impaired recollection, Ko said. Unlike older adults, younger adults may be able to use perceptual implicit memory, a different kind of visual memory, to give them a "boost" when they are trying to retrieve the stored information, Ko added. The findings were published the journal Attention, Perception & Psychophysics.

LONDON, Oct. 7 (UPI) -- The London Fire Brigade is asking the public to use some "common sense" after firefighters assisted a man whose penis was stuck in a toaster.The Fire Brigade said the 1,300 emergency calls involving people stuck or trapped since 2010 included a man with his penis stuck in a toaster, an adult stuck in a child's toy car and 79 people who were unable to free themselves from handcuffs donned for amorous purposes, The Mirror Reported Monday."Some of the incidents our firefighters are called out could be prevented with a little common sense," Third Officer Dave Brown said. "I don't know whether it's the 'Fifty Shades' effect, but the number of incidents involving items like handcuffs seems to have gone up."The calls also included nine men with rings stuck on their privates, four people with their hands stuck in blenders and five people with their hands stuck in paper shredders.

DETROIT, Sept. 26 (UPI) -- Pinch-runner Don Kelly scored the go-ahead run in the eighth on a fielder's choice grounder Wednesday, lifting Detroit to a 5-4 victory over Kansas City.The Tigers protected their share of the American League Central lead by overcoming an early three-run deficit.Jeff Francoeur's fourth-inning homer gave the Royals a 4-1 lead, but Alex Avila hit a two-run shot in the bottom half of the inning and Austin Jackson then produced his 16th homer of the year to tie the contest.Kansas City left fielder Alex Gordon preserved the tie in the fifth by reaching over the wall to take a potential home run away from Miguel Cabrera, but the Tigers finally came through with the winning run in the eighth.Delmon Young reached on a one-out, infield single against Kelvin Herrera (4-3) and gave way to Kelly as a pinch runner. Kelly stole second and took third on a single by Andy Dirks.That brought up Jhonny Peralta, who hit a grounder to Mike Moustakas at third. Rather than try to get Kelly at the plate, Moustakas attempted to turn a double play. His throw to second baseman Irving Falu was in time to force Dirks, but Dirks took out Falu with his slide to prevent the double play from being completed.Joaquin Benoit (4-3) worked the eighth to get the win and Jose Valverde turned in a perfect ninth for his 32nd save.

UNITED NATIONS, April 11 (UPI) -- While states may bear the primary responsibility to prosecute international crimes, doing so is a common interest, the U.N. General Assembly heard.The General Assembly held its first-ever debate on the role that international justice systems play in reconciliation. Assembly President Vuk Jeremic said it was up to each state government to prosecute international crimes."It is also our common interest," he said. "The paramount question is how international criminal justice can help reconcile former adversaries in post-conflict, transitioning societies."Rwandan Justice Minister Tharcisse Karugarama testified that most of the planners of the Rwanda genocides in 1994 were still on the loose. Apart from the Special Court for Sierra Leone, he said most court or tribunal systems prosecuting war crimes and other atrocities were hosted outside of the countries where the alleged abuses took place."International criminal justice is in a crisis with regard to fostering national reconciliation in post-conflict situations," he said.The Chadian government has been criticized for failing to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, wanted for war crimes in Darfur, during a recent visit. Kenyan voters recently elected Uhuru Kenyatta, who is accused of committing atrocities in post-election violence in 2007, as president.Bosco Ntaganda, a rebel leader from the Democratic Republic of Congo, recently turned himself in voluntarily to the International Criminal Court, however..

NEW YORK, July 7 (UPI) -- A federal indictment unsealed in New York Wednesday lodged new charges against five men allegedly part of an al-Qaida plot against U.S. and U.K. targets.The U.S. Justice Department said the charges allege the plot against New York's subway system uncovered in September 2009 involving Colorado resident Najibullah Zazi was directed by senior al-Qaida leadership in Pakistan. Federal prosecutors say it also was directly related to Pakistani al-Qaida members' plans to use Western operatives to attack a target in the United Kingdom.The superseding indictment charges Adnan El Shukrijumah, also known as "Hamad;" Adis Medunjanin, also known as "Mohammad;" Abid Naseer; Tariq Ur Rehman, and a fifth defendant known as "Ahmad," "Sohaib" or "Zahid" with several terrorism counts.They face the possibility of life in prison if convicted."These charges underscore the global nature of the terrorist threat we face," David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security, said in a release. "They further reflect the effectiveness of mutual investigations and cooperation with our global partners in disrupting terrorism threats."Authorities allege the plot involving Zazi was organized by Saleh al-Somali, Rashid Rauf and El Shukrijumah, who led al-Qaida's "external operations" program dedicated to terrorist attacks in the United States and other Western countries. Zazi pleaded guilty to his role in the New York subway plot Feb. 22 and a co-conspirator, Zarein Ahmedzay, pleaded guilty April 23.El Shukrijumah, a 34-year-old native of Saudi Arabia who allegedly was a leader in al-Qaida's external operations program, now faces formal charges. He has been wanted by the FBI for several years and remains at large despite a $5 million reward offered for his capture.British authorities conducted searches of Naseer and Rehman's homes where they found surveillance photographs of public areas in Manchester and maps of Manchester's city center posted on a wall, with one location highlighted. The United States intends to seek the extradition of Naseer, who is in custody in the United Kingdom. Rehman is not in custody.The new indictment also alleges Medunjanin tried to crash his car into another car in New York as a last-ditch suicide attack on American soil. Medunjanin is in U.S. custody.

| License Photo	SANFORD, Fla., July 13 (UPI) -- A jury in Florida Saturday night found neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty in the shooting death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin.The verdict came after the Seminole County jury of six women deliberated a total of about 15 hours over two days following a five-week trial, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The panel could have found him guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter."You have no further business with this court," Circuit Judge Debra Nelson told Zimmerman moments after the verdict was read.The Sentinel said Zimmerman, who maintained he shot Trayvon in self-defense during a nighttime encounter while the teen walked through a gated community in Sanford in February 2012 as he walked back to his father's home after a trip to a convenience store, hugged members of his family after the verdict was read at 10 p.m. EDT. George's wife Shellie smiled and cried.Trayvon's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, were not in the courtroom when the verdict was read, the newspaper said.Special prosecutor Angela Corey, after the verdict was delivered, said prosecutors had promised to seek justice for the slain 17-year-old."To the living we owe respect. To the dead, we owe the truth," she said. "We have shown respect to the living and we believe we have brought out the truth on behalf of Trayvon Martin."Law enforcement officers were posted outside the courthouse where about 100 people peacefully chanted "No justice, no peace!" The New York Times reported.The Rev. Al Sharpton called Zimmerman's acquittal "a slap in the face to the American people" but added "it is only the first round in the pursuit of justice.""We intend to ask the Department of Justice to move forward as they did in the Rodney King case and we will closely monitor the civil case against Mr. Zimmerman," the civil rights activist said in a statement. "I will convene an emergency call with preachers tonight to discuss next steps."The Miami Herald reported Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump said "all the evidence was there to convict" Zimmerman, now 29. "This family is heartbroken that the killer of their son is not going to be held accountable," Crump said. "It makes no sense that in 2013 you can follow and shoot an unarmed teenager walking home with nothing other than candy and a drink, and go free."Earlier in the evening, the jurors had asked the judge to clarify her instructions for the charge of manslaughter."May we please have clarification on the instructions regarding manslaughter?" the jurors' written question to Nelson asked. The Sentinel reported that after the attorneys in the case and Nelson discussed the matter the judge read aloud the following statement given the jury:"The court cannot engage in general discussions but may be able to address a specific question regarding clarification of the instructions regarding manslaughter. If you have a specific question please submit."Meanwhile, law enforcement officers interceded when a verbal confrontation erupted in the Seminole County courthouse Saturday afternoon. The Sentinel said a man, who identified himself as Jack Scott, a Zimmerman supporter from Winter Springs, walked up to a group of Martin supporters and shouted "go get your welfare checks" and "go get your crack." Scott and a man from that group got into a verbal altercation, prompting officers to step in, the newspaper said."There was a verbal disagreement between two individuals in the assembly zone and deputies simply pulled them aside individually to ask them to be respectful of one another," Seminole County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Heather Smith said. "They both agreed, they are both still there, and there was never any physical contact between the two individuals."The jury had deliberated all day Saturday after mulling the case for 3 1/2 hours Friday after the defense ended its closing arguments.Dozens of people also had gathered outside the courthouse Friday. Afterward, some of them assembled peacefully at a "free speech zone" near a fountain outside the building.Five miles away, about 30 people met in the predominately black community of Goldsboro to discuss the case.Police have prepared for possible violence, but Friday's crowds were mostly calm, the newspaper said.A leader of the International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement showed up at the courthouse with a megaphone, but complied with deputies' requests to stop using it.

DAMASCUS, Syria, April 9 (UPI) -- The Syria government accused the United Nations of trying to broaden an investigation into an alleged chemical weapons attack in Aleppo province.The United Nations said it would send a mission to Khan al-Assal to investigate after the Syrian government accused rebels of using chemical weapons in the attack last month and rebels countered that government forces were responsible, The Guardian newspaper in Britain reported Tuesday in a blog.Western nations had called for a U.N. investigation into the use of chemical weapons across the country. A Foreign Ministry official said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had asked for "additional investigations which might allow the U.N. mission to spread all over the Syrian territories," Syria's state-run news agency SANA reported.The request, SANA said, "contradicts the Syrian request from the U.N. and indicates to the presence of hidden intentions at the states which have sought to add those investigations as this constitutes a violation of the Syrian sovereignty."Syrian government won't permit such "maneuvers" but still would allow the mission to visit Khan al-Assal as originally outlined.Ban called on the Syrian government to cooperate with the investigation."I appeal to the government of Syria to extend its full cooperation and to allow the mission to proceed," Ban said.The Syrian Network for Human Rights, based in London, called on the United Nations and the International Criminal Court to investigate, charge and prosecute "all those involved within the various security branches who have acts of torture, murder and rape, which are considered crimes against humanity ... ."Meanwhile, a video posted on the Internet showed Free Syrian Army founder Colonel Riad al-Asaad recovering in hospital after an apparent assassination attempt last month, The Guardian said.In the video, he can be seen smiling and making a victory sign. Opposition officials said al-Assad lost a leg in a car bombing in al-Mayadin in eastern Syria.

Barbie Thomas, the competitive body builder who lost both her arms at the age of two, opens up about growing up in a positive home and following her dreams.	Posted By VERONICA LINARES, UPI.com | Sept. 19, 2013 at 11:26 AM | 0 comments

Sept. 19 (UPI) -- Barbie Thomas lost both her arms in an accident involving a power transformer at the age of two."They were like charcoal," she writes in her biography on her website, Fitness Unarmed "They were completely dead and had to be amputated at the shoulders."No one expected her to survive after she climbed off a transformer and burned her arms to the bone, but Thomas is no quitter.Thirty seven years later, she has become a competitive body builder and model. "I was not allowed to be negative and say I can't do something," Thomas said of her childhood, explaining that she was brought up in a positive attitude type of home. "I was always taught to focus on what I can do, not what I can't do. It probably has a lot to do with my personality -- I can't imagine being a negative Nancy all the time."Thomas, 37, -- who lives in Phoenix with her two sons, aged 13 and 17 -- has learned to use her shoulders as her arms. In addition to having a beautifully sculptured body, Thomas has figured out a way to do two-minute performances that incorporate dance, cheerleading and gymnastics for her fitness competition. "She chose the most difficult division of all," said Miles Nuessle, Arizona chairman of the National Physique Committee. "We were thinking, 'How can she do that routine?' but she blew our minds," he said. "She was absolutely beautiful. She was on the floor jumping up and doing splits. I don't know what half the moves were called. She was rolling all over the place and shaking it -- sexy, athletic, fun and emotional. The crowd went nuts."Thomas began competing in 2003, she said that fitness had been a part of her life "forever" and that she was encouraged by a friend to participate in one of the fitness competitions she often read about. "In the first few competitions I felt that when they were calling me to go up, in their hands and their manners, they looked at me like, 'What the heck is she doing here?'" she said. "I put their doubts to rest when they saw my fitness routine."There are certain routines that you use your hands for that I can do -- I can kip-up," she said. "When you are laying on the ground it looks like you are falling backward and then you come up. Most people use their hands to push themselves up."Thomas, who clearly thrives on challenges, admits that the reason she keeps going is to prove to herself that she can do anything she sets her mind into. In the end, she's grateful for her life and concedes that things could be a lot worse. "I realize it inspires many people, and not just those with physical challenges," she said. "Follow your dreams and keep pushing and where there is a will, there is a way. We all have our own stuff to deal with and our own limitations and handicaps. Mine are just more visible. There's always someone else out there who has it worse."
