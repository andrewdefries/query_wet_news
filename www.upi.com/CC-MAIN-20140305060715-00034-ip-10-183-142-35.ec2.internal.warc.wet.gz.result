ASHLAND, Mass., Feb. 9 (UPI) -- An Ashland, Mass., driver was arrested and charged for throwing a handful of pennies at another car, police said.Paul P. Castelli, 42, was angry at a driver who honked at him Tuesday and retaliated by throwing a handful of pennies, MetroWest Daily News, Framingham, Mass., reported.Police said the driver of the car that was showered with pennies honked when Castelli, in a GMC pickup, pulled out of a side street."At the next light, the pickup beeped its horn and the driver leaned out and threw a handful of coins at the car," said police spokesman Lt. Richard Briggs. "The coins went through the open window and the open sunroof."A passenger in the car was hit in the face with a penny and the car was scratched by pennies, a police report of the incident said.The driver of the car wrote down Castelli's license number and called police, who tracked him to his home, where he was arrested.Castelli was charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon -- the coins -- and malicious destruction of property worth more than $250.Castelli pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released without bail. He is due back in court March 12.

WASHINGTON, June 13 -- Graeme McDowell might not be the number one favorite to win this week -- he is actually looking quite good as the number 4 favorite -- but he is definitely the crowd favorite! Playing alone in a practice round Wednesday, McDowell was all business. He was one of the few golfers who played a "real" practice round, taking the time to play several balls from different parts of the course and around the greens. One could tell he was doing his homework.Unlike many players, however, McDowell did not let business get in the way of enjoying his time out there and making fans happy. At one point, he waited to sign an autograph for a young fan who ran inside the ropes. Not only did McDonald not turn his back and continue walking, he encouraged the shy boy to come up for his prize. Way to go Graeme! You're my favorite this week. I don't think that I am alone in wishing you all the luck and your second U.S. Open trophy.

TEHRAN, Nov. 11 (UPI) -- Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency said Monday they agreed to work together to resolve past and present concerns about Iran's nuclear program."It was agreed that Iran and the IAEA will cooperate further with respect to verification activities to be undertaken by the IAEA to resolve all present and past issues," a joint statement read. "It is foreseen that Iran's cooperation will include providing the IAEA with timely information about its nuclear facilities and in regard to the implementation of transparency measures."Inspectors with the IAEA visited with Iranian leaders Monday in Tehran. In past reports, the IAEA said there may be a military dimension to certain aspects of Iran's nuclear program, an allegation the Iranian government denies.Iran insists on its right to enrich uranium, a process its adversaries fear is a path to a nuclear weapon.The joint statement said both sides agreed to "strengthen their cooperation and dialogue aimed at ensuring the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program."The statement Monday followed two days of talks between Iran, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany in Geneva last week. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who last week flew to Geneva to help with the talks, was quoted Monday by the BBC as saying Iran was unable to sign off on a deal "at that particular moment [in Geneva]." He said a deal could be reached in the coming months "that meets everyone's standards."

NEW DELHI, Dec. 28 (UPI) -- The 23-year-old woman who was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi this month died early Saturday at a hospital in Singapore, hospital officials said.The woman -- a student whose name has not been reported -- had been listed in critical condition at the hospital, where she was taken for treatment. She was pronounced dead at 4:45 a.m., The (Singapore) Straits Times reported.The hospital said late Friday there had been signs of organ failure, the newspaper said.Six men raped her Dec. 16 on a bus she and her boyfriend were riding on. They beat her boyfriend and then threw both victims off the bus.The woman had undergone three surgical procedures since the attack.The Indian government, facing mounting public pressure over sexual violence against women, said it will publicly name thousands of convicted sex offenders.Indian Minister of State for Home Affairs R.P.N. Singh said the government will publish sex offenders' names, photographs and addresses, starting in New Delhi where protests have mounted over the gang rape, some of the protests turning violent, The Guardian reported."We are planning to start the process [of identification] in Delhi," Singh said. "Photographs, names and addresses of the rapists will be uploaded on the Delhi police website also."Police chiefs and government officials were to meet with activists and others Friday to go over the implementation of the plan to publish the information, despite concerns of potential vigilante attacks against the convicted offenders."It is true that there is a risk of such attacks but at the moment it is the victim who has to suffer the shame and social ostracism," Ranjana Kumari, director of Delhi's Center for Social Research, told The Guardian. "She can't get married, for example. This will make sure the rapist is shamed. He won't get a job, or somewhere to live and will be cut off from society. This is a powerful deterrent."

March. 19 (UPI) -- Like many young men who read Sports Illustrated, Los Angeles high school student Jake Davidson is completely enamored with its 20-year-old cover model Kate Upton. So enamored in fact, that he made a two-minute YouTube video asking her to prom. "I'm Jewish, 5'9" on a really good day, and I can't dance at all. You're Christian, 5'10", and that Cat Daddy video should have won an Oscar for Best Short Film," Davidson argues as he rubs shaving cream on his face. "You could say this is destiny.""Great moments are born from great opportunity," Davidson muses as a friend in a bathrobe hands him his suit vest. "That's what we have here today: a chance to make a nice guy's senior year the best ever."This isn't the first time enterprising fans have aimed for their dream dates.Minnesota teen Mike Stone invited his favorite porn stars to his senior prom last year, and Mila Kunis escorted one lucky Marine, Sgt. Scott Moore, to his 2011 Marine Corps Ball in North Carolina. There's no word from Upton yet, but Davidson is updating Twitter users with his progress @JakeDavidson23 under the hashtag #promwithjake. @kateupton you are the most beautiful woman in the world! Please do me the great honor of going to prom with me!youtube.com/watch?v=NvxqUE…— jake davidson (@JakeDavidson23) March 17, 2013
[H/T The Daily Dot]UPDATE: Upton acknowledged his unorthodox invitation over Twitter, saying she'd check her schedule. “@jakedavidson23:youtube.com/watch?v=NvxqUE…” you can call me Katie if you want! How could I turn down that video! I'll check my schedule ;)— Kate Upton (@KateUpton) March 19, 2013
And the "Today" show arranged a phone call between the two on Wednesday morning's episode. Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy
