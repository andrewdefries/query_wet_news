TEHRAN, Oct. 8 (UPI) -- An Iranian official said his country was ready to make up for any natural gas shortages in Turkey following a pipeline explosion near the border.Turkish officials last week blamed militants for an attack on the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum natural gas pipeline. BP Azerbaijan, a subsidiary operating in the Shah Deniz natural gas field offshore Azerbaijan, suspended deliveries to Turkey as a result.Majid Boujarzadeh, a spokesman for the National Iranian Gas Co., said Iran was on standby should Turkey require additional supplies."Whenever the flow of gas exports into Turkey faces a problem, Iran will be ready to make up for the reduced imports," he was quoted by the semiofficial Mehr News Agency as saying.The region's Trend news service reported that Ankara said it wouldn't take on more gas from other suppliers because there was no shortage. The news service added that Tehran, however, was eager to work with Ankara on delivering natural gas to European markets.Europe is examining gas supplies from Azerbaijan piped through Turkey. Iran had said it could play a role in potential European transit networks, though Western governments have said Tehran was limited by economic sanction.Iranian Oil Minister spokesman Alireza Nikzad-Rahbar was quoted by Mehr as saying any threat to ban gas deliveries to the eurozone was a "propaganda campaign."

LOS ANGELES, May 4 (UPI) -- Charlie Sheen said he supports the decision to remove his twin sons from the custody of ex-wife Brooke Mueller to that of another ex-wife, Denise Richards.The Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family Services determined Mueller's home was unsafe because she was using drugs again, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday."It just wasn't a stable environment with different nannies coming in and out, and child protective services came in and did their thing, and this is the outcome," a source close to Mueller told the New York Daily News. "Brooke didn't have a say in this."The boys -- Bob and Max -- were placed in temporary custody with Richards, with whom Sheen has two daughters, 9-year-old Sam and 7-year-old Lola, the newspaper said."Charlie supports the actions of the Department of Children and Family Services," his rep told TMZ. "He knows Max and Bob are safe and in a stable, loving environment with Denise and the boys' sisters."This is not the first time Richards has taken care of her ex-husband's children.She watched over them late last year while Mueller was in rehab for substance abuse for the 19th time, the Times said."Brooke knows any time, and Charlie, that any time they need help with the boys, that I'm there," Richards told Radar Online at the Time.Radar reported Mueller is refusing to go to rehab again."Brooke was given many opportunities by social workers to clean up her act," a source, whose name was not reported, told Radar.

| License Photo	NEW LONDON, Conn., Oct. 15 (UPI) -- Eating Oreos is just as addictive as cocaine, at least in rats, and like many humans, rats eat the smooth sweet filling first, U.S. researchers say. Professor Joseph Schroeder and his students Jamie Honohan, Becca Markson, Gabriela Lopez and Katrina Bantis of Connecticut College in New London found rats formed an equally strong association between the pleasurable effects of eating Oreos and a specific environment as they did between cocaine or morphine and a specific environment. They also found that eating cookies activated more neurons in the brain's "pleasure center" than exposure to drugs of abuse. "Our research supports the theory that high-fat/high-sugar foods stimulate the brain in the same way that drugs do," Schroeder said in a statement. "It may explain why some people can't resist these foods despite the fact that they know they are bad for them."To test the addictiveness of Oreos, the researchers measured the association between "drug" and environment.On one side of a maze, they would give hungry rats Oreos and on the other, they would give them a control -- in this case, rice cakes. Then, they would give the rats the option of spending time on either side of the maze and measure how long they would spend on the side where they were typically fed Oreos."Just like humans, rats don't seem to get much pleasure out of eating rice cakes," Schroeder added. The researchers compared the results of the Oreo and rice cake test with results from rats that were given an injection of cocaine or morphine on one side of the maze and a shot of saline on the other.The study showed rats conditioned with Oreos spent as much time on the "drug" side of the maze as the rats conditioned with cocaine or morphine.The researchers measured for neuronal activity on the brain's pleasure center -- or how many cells were turned on in a specific region of the brain in response to the drugs or Oreos, Schroeder said. The Oreos activated significantly more neurons than cocaine or morphine, the study said. "This correlated well with our behavioral results and lends support to the hypothesis that high-fat/ high-sugar foods are addictive," said Schroeder.Schroeder is scheduled to present the findings next month at the Society for Neuroscience conference in San Diego.

BOSTON, Oct. 2 (UPI) -- The Boston Red Sox announced Tuesday pitcher Tim Wakefield has been left off the club's roster for their AL Division Series against the LA Angels.Red Sox manager Terry Francona is hoping the rest will give Wakefield, a starter, a chance to recover from an ailing back and pitch for the team in the ALCS and beyond if Boston goes that far."We want to give him a chance to pitch on our roster in the series," Francona added. "It was putting the team in a very difficult spot, but we needed a chance to talk about it again."Wakefield, a 41-year-old right-handed knuckleballer, finished with a 17-12 record and a 4.76 ERA in 31 starts for the AL East champions. He missed a scheduled start Aug. 31 with a back injury and ended the season 1-2 in his last five starts, allowing 39 hits and 24 earned runs over his 24 2/3 final innings.

WASHINGTON, May 21 (UPI) -- A group of former prosecutors and judges has filed a friend-of-the-court brief with the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of an inmate on death row in Georgia.Troy Davis was sentenced to death in 1991 after he was convicted of shooting an off-duty police officer in Savannah. A federal appeals court, ruling 2-1 in April, denied him a hearing to present evidence of innocence.Those signing the brief, including former U.S. Rep. Bob Barr and former FBI Director William Sessions, say Davis has "new, never reviewed evidence that strongly points to his innocence," The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Wednesday. That includes recantations by seven of the nine prosecution witnesses who identified Davis as the killer of Mark Allen MacPhail. Several of the witnesses now say the real killer was the man who first suggested to police that Davis was the man who shot the 27-year-old officer.The appeals court granted a 30-day stay of execution that expired Saturday.

JOLIET, Ill., Aug. 7 (UPI) -- Drew Peterson, an ex-cop on trial in Illinois for killing his third wife, said life would be easier if she was dead, a former colleague testified Tuesday. Bolingbrook police Lt. James Coughlin said he ran into Peterson, a sergeant in the department at the time, and his divorce lawyers in the Will County Courthouse in February 2004, a few months after Peterson's divorce from Kathleen Savio, the Chicago Tribune reported. Coughlin said another officer remarked the lawyers seemed happy and Peterson responded that they were getting all his money. Coughlin testified Peterson then made a remark he remembered because Savio's body was found a few weeks later in her bathtub. "My life would be easier if she was dead -- or died, I don't recall which word," Coughlin said.Also Tuesday, a police officer who investigated Savio's death said he noticed a scrape on her left buttock but said there was nothing to suggest she had been killed. Robert Deel, who is with the state police, said he decided to wait for the autopsy to determine the cause of death.Matt VanOver, a deputy coroner in Will County, said he noticed some suspicious circumstances. He said the bathtub was surprisingly clean and bottles of shampoo and other items were standing upright that would probably have tipped over if Savio had fallen. "There was no obvious signs of struggle or foul play in the bathtub. I don't know how else she could have drowned," he said. "If a person would have fallen in that bathtub, I'm of the opinion that those bottles around the edge of that bathtub would have gone flying."Savio was face down, which seemed like an unlikely position if she was the victim of an accidental fall, VanOver said. But VanOver acknowledged he did not tell investigators his misgivings at the time, and Savio's death was ruled accidental.Peterson married Stacy Cales immediately after his divorce became final. When she vanished in 2007, the investigation into Savio's death was reopened.Peterson has not been charged in his fourth wife's disappearance.

NEW YORK, Oct. 17 (UPI) -- A New York City man who raped a 74-year-old bird watcher in Central Park has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.David Albert Mitchell, 43, pleaded guilty to rape in the first degree and sexually motivated robbery in the second degree two weeks ago and was sentenced Wednesday to 30 years in prison plus an additional 10 years of supervised release, The New York Times reported."For a plea bargain, this is one of the highest sentences I have ever given pretrial," said Justice Bonnie G. Wittner of State Supreme Court after the sentencing. "My intention was to punish him and make sure he will never hurt any other person again."Prosecutors said Mitchell raped a 74-year-old bird-watcher in a wooded area Central Park on Sept. 12, 2012.The victim, whose name was not released, spoke before Wittner sentenced Mitchell."Make no mistake, this is a sexual terrorist," she said. "There is only one proper punishment for a terrorist. He must be locked away in a horrible prison for the rest of his life.""You, David Albert Mitchell, for the pain you inflicted on me and, by association, on my loving family and friends, may you rot in hell for all eternity," she added.

CAIRO, June 10 (UPI) -- An Egyptian court Monday ordered the release of former President Hosni Mubarak's sons, Alaa and Gamal, in their corruption retrial, but they'll stay in prison.The court ruled the men had been detained in prison longer than the maximum period allowed by law, which is two years, Ahram Online reported.The two men, though, will remain in custody because they face other corruption charges, the news service said.The court also ruled the retrial of Mubarak -- on charges he failed to protect protesters and was complicit in the deaths of unarmed protesters during the 18-day uprising that led to his ouster in 2011 -- will resume July 6. The 84-year-old former leader, who is in failing health and being held in Cairo's Tora Prison Hospital, had previously been convicted and given a life sentence on the charges but was granted a retrial because of procedural problems.The retrial has been put off three times -- most recently postponed for 30 days in May so a presiding judge could have time to read thousands of pages of documents.The reason for Monday's extension was not reported.Mubarak also faces charges of illicit gains and exporting natural gas to Israel at below-market prices.

Wiki
Roger Federer (German pronunciation: ) (born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player who held the ATP number one position for a record 237 consecutive weeks, and 285 weeks overall. As of 10 September 2011, he is ranked World No. 3 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Federer has won a men's record 16 Grand Slam singles titles. He is one of seven male players to capture the career Grand Slam and one of three (with Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal) to do so on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts). He is the only male player in tennis history to have reached the title match of each Grand Slam tournament at least 5 times. Many sports analysts, tennis critics, and former and current players consider Federer to be the greatest tennis player of all time.
Federer has appeared in an unprecedented 23 career Grand Slam finals, of which 10 were consecutive appearances, and appeared in 18 of 19 finals over the four and a half years from the 2005 Wimbledon Championships through the 2010 Australian Open, the lone exception being the 2008 Australian Open. He holds the record of reaching the semifinals or better of 23 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments over five and a half years from the 2004 Wimbledon Championships through the 2010 Australian Open. At the 2011 US Open he reached a record 30th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal.
Federer has won a record five ATP World Tour Finals (shared with Ivan Lendl and Pete Sampras) and 17 ATP Masters Series tournaments (tied second all-time). He also won the Olympic gold medal in doubles with his compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. For the past eight years (2003–2010) he has been in the top two in the year-end rankings.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
