VIENNA, Feb. 5 (UPI) -- The company behind the planned Nabucco West pipeline said it started the pre-qualification process for steel pipe producers.Nabucco Gas Pipeline International GmbH said it called on potential steel suppliers to apply for the pre-qualification phase for the planned construction of the 820-mile, 48-inch Nabucco West pipeline.Nabucco West is part of the Southern Corridor, a planned network of natural gas pipelines meant to break the Russian grip on the regional energy sector. It would draw gas largely from the Shah Deniz offshore gas field in Azerbaijan.Nabucco West would carry Azeri gas from the Turkish border to Hungary."The launch of this pre-qualification process is yet another step toward ensuring that Nabucco is ready to meet the gas delivery schedules of the Shah Deniz consortium," the group said from Vienna.Last week, the consortium said it chose Italian contractor Saipem to start engineering design work for the pipeline.The project is up against the planned Trans-Adriatic Pipeline to secure gas from the BP-led consortium working offshore Azerbaijan. A decision is expected by June.

Today is Thursday, Feb. 13, the 44th day of 2014 with 321 to follow.The moon is waxing. The morning stars are Mars, Saturn and Venus. The evening stars are Jupiter, Mercury, Neptune and Uranus.Those born on this date are under the sign of Aquarius. They include Bess Truman, wife of former U.S. President Harry Truman, in 1885; artist Grant Wood in 1891; writer Georges Simenon in 1903; golf Hall of Fame member Patty Berg in 1918; singer "Tennessee" Ernie Ford and football Coach Eddie Robinson, both in 1919; pilot Chuck Yeager, the first man to fly faster than the speed of sound, in 1923 (age 91); actors Kim Novak in 1933 (age 81), George Segal in 1934 (age 80), Oliver Reed in 1938, Carol Lynley in 1942 (age 72) and Stockard Channing in 1944 (age 70); talk show host Jerry Springer, also in 1944 (age 70); musicians Peter Tork of the Monkees in 1942 (age 72) and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Peter Gabriel (Genesis) in 1950 (age 64); actor David Naughton in 1951 (age 63); Hall of Fame basketball Coach Mike Krzyzewski in 1947 (age 67); and fitness activist Denise Austin in 1957 (age 57).On this date in history:In 1635, the Boston Latin School was founded. (It is the oldest public school in the United States.)In 1668, Portugal was recognized as an independent nation by Spain.In 1861, the first Medal of Honor was awarded. It went to Col. Bernard Irwin, an assistant Army surgeon serving in the first major U.S.-Apache conflict.In 1945, allied firebombing of the German city of Dresden caused a firestorm that destroyed the city and killed as many as 135,000 people.In 1960, France tested its first atomic weapon.In 1974, the Soviet Union expelled dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn.In 1984, Konstantin Chernenko succeeded the late Yuri Andropov as Soviet leader.In 2001, more than 400 people were killed in an earthquake in El Salvador.In 2002, Pakistani police announced the arrest of the prime suspect in the abduction and slaying of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.In 2006, a U.N. report accused the United States of violating prisoners' rights at its military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.In 2009, a Continental airlines turboprop commuter plane crashed into a house near Buffalo, N.Y., killing 50 people, including one person in the house.In 2013, authorities announced that 10 police officers in the Atlanta area had been charged with taking payoffs to protect a drug gang. The U.S. attorney in the city said "the "breadth of corruption is troubling."A thought for the day: U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said, "I hope for an America where we can all contend freely and vigorously, but where we will treasure and guard those standards of civility which alone make this nation safe for both democracy and diversity."

| License Photo	HOUSTON, Nov. 28 (UPI) -- The Houston Astros, coming off a 106-loss season, said Sunday they have dumped Ed Wade as general manager and Tal Smith as team president.Astros Chief Executive Officer George Postolos said the team, which officially changed ownership this month and is bound for the American League, is looking for a breath of fresh air."We are searching for a candidate who has the knowledge, skills and experience to build a winner and a strong commitment to player development in order to sustain success," Postolos said. "Our goal is to consistently compete for a championship, and we know the first step towards that goal is to develop one of the top farm systems in baseball. We will hire the best candidate available to achieve our goal."Dave Gottfried will be the interim general manger for the time being.Since Wade became GM in September 2007, Houston has had just one winning season and concluded the 2011 season with a dismal 56-106 mark. He previously was GM in Philadelphia from 1998 to 2005.Smith had been affiliated with the Astros for 35 years, including the last 17 as team president.

| License Photo	MOSCOW, Aug. 7 (UPI) -- Gay rights will not be not infringed upon at any time during the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, a top Russian government official insisted Wednesday.Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said "there will be no diminishing of rights based on sexual orientation at the Olympics, neither before nor after," RIA Novosti reported.Kozak's statement was prompted by calls by Western activists to boycott the games after President Vladimir Putin signed a law in June banning the display of any "non-traditional sexual orientation" to minors."No one should have any concerns whatsoever," Kozak asserted. "People can get on with their private lives, and spread their respective advantages and attraction among adults. The main thing is that this doesn't touch children."Russian officials have had mixed messages about how gays and lesbians at the Olympics might be affected by the law.The International Olympic Committee told R-Sport this month it had received assurances from "the highest level" of the Russian government that neither competitors or visitors would be impacted.Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko later told R-Sport anyone found to be "propagandizing" gay relationships would be "held accountable."International groups and organizations, including the European Court of Human Rights, have criticized Russia for its treatment of gays and lesbians.

PARIS, June 11 (UPI) -- If we escape this year with merely a double-dip recession, we should count ourselves fortunate. The global economy is faltering everywhere at once, with prospects of further horrors to come.The grim news from Spain's banks Friday along with Moody's warnings of mass downgrades for all the eurozone countries overshadowed the report from Germany's statistical office that the country's exports declined in April. If Europe's powerhouse is slowing, along with the Chinese, U.S., Indian and Brazilian economies, there is little prospect of any recovery in global demand.The future is best described in the memorable words of former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, being full of known unknowns and unknown unknowns.The first of the known unknowns is whether the $125 billion now offered from Europe's rescue funds will succeed in recapitalizing Spain's banks. It probably would, if one believes the banks' balance sheets, which have yet fully to write down the value of their property loans. So far, they have written down about 20 percent, but with a million empty or unfinished buildings depressing the property market the true write-down could be as much as 50 percent. That is why J.P. Morgan reckons the Spanish banks need more than three times the $125 billion now on offer.The second of the known unknowns includes figures to be released in Beijing this week on just how badly the Chinese economy is slowing. The surprise announcement Thursday of a cut in lending rates suggests that Beijing, which knows the data for May already, is worried enough to ignore any threat of inflation and is hoping to spur the economy back to growth. The figure to watch will be consumer spending, since the shift from investment-led to consumer-led growth is the key to the government's strategy. The fear will be that the return of easy money will simply refuel the property bubble.The third and most panic-making known unknown is whether next Sunday's Greek election triggers a Greek departure from the euro. The odds are close to even whether New Democracy wins the most votes and agrees to implement Europe's harsh austerity terms, or whether the upstart Syriza party comes out on top and tries (and fails) to renegotiate the European terms. That would mean no more money for Greece and a probable default, triggering who knows what forms of contagion.The fourth and in reality by far the most serious of the known unknowns is whether the U.S. government can get through this year without triggering the dramatic spending cuts that Congress voted in an attempt to get itself to see sense. If the United States drops off the fiscal cliff in December, the rest of the world goes with it.The unknown unknowns are a lot harder to envisage, let alone to define, because they are less economic questions that political ones, so rational thinking may not be much of a guide.The first turns on the question whether the eurozone can muster the political will to take the bold financial measures required to hold itself together. If it cannot, would that mean the demise of the European Union? This is really a question about Germany, and whether Chancellor Angela Merkel can persuade the Bundestag and the country's constitutional court to approve the guarantees that would be needed.The Germans themselves are divided. A survey in Germany's Focus magazine indicated 45 percent of Germans polled agreeing with Merkel that a failure of the euro would collapse the European Union. But 43 percent said that Europe would survive quite well without the euro.The second unknown unknown is the nature of contagion and the way that panic spreads. Spain is already suffering a slow-motion bank run. Nobody really knows whether the global financial markets would freeze up once Greece leaves the euro and if Spain is next in the firing line does the contagion spread to Italy and France?The third unknown unknown is whether the United States system of governance can reach any kind of compromise on the debt and spending crisis? The bipartisan Simpson-Bowles report offered a reasonable plan but U.S. President Barack Obama lacked the political courage to give it the kind of whole-hearted backing it would need.What we do know is that there are three triggers that could set off a collapse of the euro, and the world-wide 1931-style Depression that could follow. The first would be a Lehman-style bankruptcy of one or more of Europe's top 20 banks. The second would be a forced default on bond payments by a major economy; Spain being most likely, followed by Italy. The third would be a political crisis, a riot that gets out of hand, burns a central bank and topples a government. There is no sign of this as yet but Greece has flirted with such a disaster, which brings us back to the known unknowns with which this column began.

FORT PIERCE, Fla., Nov. 16 (UPI) -- A Florida judge Friday denied Rep. Allen West's request for a recount of the early-voting ballots in St. Lucie County.Circuit Judge Dan Vaughn said he didn't have the authority to issue an injunction ordering the recount of 37,379 early-voting ballots West sought after problems were discovered in the counting of early ballots on Election Night, The Palm Beach Post reported.Vaughn's ruling effectively leaves the decision in the hands of the county's canvassing board, which was scheduled to meet Friday.Unofficial returns show Democrat Patrick Murphy, in Washington for orientation, ahead by 1,907 votes or 0.58 percent, beyond the margin that triggers an automatic recount.West hasn't conceded.Vaughn said West has other legal options, citing a statute that allows a candidate to contest an election within 10 days of the final certification of results, which is scheduled for Tuesday.The canvassing board originally planned a full recount of early votes after some were double-counted and others ignored on Election Night. However, the board later decided to recount only 16,275 ballots from three of the eight days of early voting.That recount resulted in 799 early votes disappearing from the West-Murphy race. West had argued the irregularities that were discovered during the partial recount merited a full recount.If the canvassing board decides to recount the early-voting ballots and West gets enough votes to pull within the 0.5 percentage point margin, a full recount could be triggered in the three counties that make up the 18th Congressional District -- northern Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties.

NEW PALTZ, N.Y., Feb. 7 (UPI) -- A resort hotel in New York's Hudson Valley shut down for a week Friday due to a gastrointestinal illness outbreak suspected to be norovirus, officials say.The Mohonk Mountain House, on the shore of a half-mile-long lake in New Paltz, N.Y., 90 miles north of New York City, closed a week after guests at the National Historic Landmark started complaining of a stomach virus, Marketing Director Nina Smiley told United Press International.The virus also affected staff members."Preliminary information indicates that the illness is consistent with norovirus," state Department of Health spokesman Jeffrey Hammond told UPI in a statement.The department is investigating the outbreak with the local Ulster County Department of Health to verify the source of the illness, he said.The norovirus causes severe stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.It is the most common cause of gastroenteritis, or the "stomach bug," in the United States, infecting 1 in every 15 Americans a year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.It is "not considered serious for the general population," Hammond said.People typically contract it by eating virus-contaminated foods, drinking infected liquids, touching contaminated surfaces or having direct contact with an infected person, the CDC says.Mohonk is undergoing a deep cleaning and sanitization process, Smiley told UPI.Disaster-remediation company BMS Cat Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, "sent their team -- 200 people working around the clock on this," she said.Mohonk's management expects to reopen the 145-year-old castle-like resort Feb. 14, in time for the Valentine's Day weekend, Smiley said.The 259-room hotel, which can accommodate 600 guests, has "never closed before," Smiley said."There are viruses going around and one happened to hit Mohonk," she told UPI, adding, "We're just looking forward to being back to business as usual."

DAK SONG, Vietnam, Jan. 23 (UPI) -- Toy grenades that sickened 37 schoolchildren in Vietnam contain citric acid and sodium bicarbonate, police in Dak Song District said Thursday. Neither chemical is classified as toxic, Tuoi Tre News reported. The toys, manufactured in China, are shaped like grenades. If they are stepped on or hit hard, the two substances combine to produce carbon dioxide, which expands, producing a small explosion. Children who played with them reported a sharp smell and 37, all students at Chu Van An Primary School in Dak Song, developed symptoms that included chest pain and trouble breathing. All were quickly released from a hospital, but the symptoms recurred in some of the children and they had to be hospitalized again. The children reported buying the grenades from a store near their school for 5 cents each. Police have seized the store's entire supply.

Wiki
Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky (Russian: Влади́мир Во́льфович Жирино́вский; born 25 April 1946) is a Russian politician, colonel of the Russian Army, founder and the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), Vice-Chairman of the State Duma, and a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
Zhirinovsky was born in Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, modern-day Kazakhstan. In July 1964, Zhirinovsky moved from Almaty to Moscow, where he began his studies in the Department of Turkish Studies, Institute of Asian and African Studies at Moscow State University (MSU), from which he graduated in 1969. Zhirinovsky then went into military service in Tbilisi during the early 1970s. He would later get a law degree and work at various posts in state committees and unions. He was awarded a Ph.D. in philosophy by MSU in 1998. Although he participated in some underground reformist groups, Zhirinovsky was largely inconsequential in Soviet political developments during the 1980s. While he contemplated a role in politics, a nomination attempt for a seat as a People's Deputy in 1989 was quickly abandoned.
In 1990, Zhirinovsky, along with Vladimir Bogachev, took initiatives which led to the founding of the Liberal Democratic Party, the second registered party in the Soviet Union and therefore the first officially sanctioned opposition party. According to the former CPSU Politburo member Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev, this party was a joint project of Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) leadership and the KGB. Yakovlev wrote in his memoirs that KGB director Vladimir Kryuchkov presented the project of the puppet LDPR party at a meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev and informed him about a selection of the LDPR leader. According to Yakovlev, the name of the party was invented by KGB General Philipp Bobkov. However Bobkov said that he was against the creation of this "Zubatov's pseudo-party under KGB control that directs interests and sentiments of certain social groups".	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
