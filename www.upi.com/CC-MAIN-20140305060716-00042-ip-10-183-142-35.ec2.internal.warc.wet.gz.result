ELANCOURT, France, July 10 (UPI) -- Advanced identification systems to help avoid friendly fire incidents are being provided to the French military by Cassidian.The contract announced – its value was not disclosed – is for 150 of the company's Monopulse Secondary Radar 1000 I interrogators used for short-range IFF.The MSR 1000 I units will be installed on army MISTRAL missile launchers and MARTHA air defense command-and-control stations. They will also be outfitted on air force armored launch vehicles for CROTALE NG missiles.According to Cassidian, the order is part of a French initiative to develop equipment that complies with a new NATO interoperability standard."This contract is of strategic importance for the future," said Bruno Rambaud, head of Cassidian SAS in France. "It makes Cassidian the European reference for short-range and very short-range IFF NG (next generation) interrogators and it is a springboard to other markets as the NATO allies will all eventually migrate to the new IFF standards." The MSR 1000 I identifies aircraft by using sophisticated encryption techniques, mitigating enemy attempts to produce false signals.

CHICAGO, June 12 (UPI) -- Airport metal detectors almost always go off for replacement hips and knees, but miss replacement shoulders and wrists, a new study has found.Researcher Dr. Edward Rodriguez of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston used 129 volunteers with a total of 149 implants to test a borrowed detector set both on normal and sensitive and found all total hips and 90 percent of knee replacements were caught on the normal setting, the Chicago Sun-Times reported Tuesday.None of the screws, wires or nails was caught used in some surgical repairs, while 14 percent of steel plates triggered the alarm, the study published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery said.Chicago residents Charlie Holzner, 80, and his wife Anne Marie, 79, travel often and constantly set off metal detectors with his artificial hip and her artificial knee. Holzner told the newspaper he finds it annoying, but also reassuring."But if I went through and it didn't go off, it would scare me," Charles said. "I have enough metal in my hip to make two or three guns."

BURGOS, Mexico, May 23 (UPI) -- Archaeologists are reporting the discovery of nearly 5,000 cave paintings at 11 different sites in Mexico, likely created by early hunter-gatherers.The red, white, black and yellow images discovered near Burgos in eastern central Mexico depict humans engaged in hunting, fishing and gathering, and animals such as deer, lizards and centipedes.The paintings are as yet undated but archaeologists said they hope to take samples of the pigments to determine their approximate age."The discovery is important because we have documented the presence of pre-Hispanic groups in Burgos, where before it was said there was nothing," Gustavo Ramirez from the Mexican National Institute of Anthropology told Britain's The Independent.Another archaeologist involved in the research said little is known about the ethnic groups who may have lived in the caves."These groups escaped the Spanish rule for almost 200 years because they fled to the Sierra de San Carlos where they had water, plants and animals to feed themselves," Martha Garcia Sanchez said."We have not found any ancient objects linked to the context, and because the paintings are on ravine walls and in the rainy season the sediments are washed away, all we have is gravel," she said.

| License Photo	SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 16 (UPI) -- A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Monday kept same-sex marriage on hold in California at least until early December.The judges issued an order agreeing to an expedited review of the Aug. 4 ruling by U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker overturning Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. The panel scheduled a hearing for the week of Dec.6, at which plaintiffs and defendants in the case are to present arguments on whether supporters of Proposition 8 have legal standing to appeal Walker's ruling, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday.Plaintiffs asked a federal appeals court last week to allow same-sex marriages to proceed in the state beginning Wednesday.Walker last week announced a decision to lift a stay on his injunction blocking enforcement of Prop 8, but said the stay would remain in place until Wednesday. He warned the amendment's sponsors may not have standing, or status, to appeal his ruling because they were not affected by the stay.If higher courts concur with Walker on the standing issue, they would not decide the issue on its merits, the newspaper said. However, the case could still get further hearings on procedural issues.In issuing a preliminary injunction Aug. 4 against the ban Walker said it "both unconstitutionally burdens the exercise of the fundamental right to marry and creates an irrational classification on the basis of sexual orientation."California voters approved the ban in November 2008 by a 52.3 percent majority six months after the California Supreme Court ruled laws against same-sex marriage violated the state Constitution. The state court later upheld Prop 8 as a valid amendment to the state Constitution.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 (UPI) -- The probe into Marine Gen. John Allen's relationship with a Tampa, Fla., socialite will be kept secret, the U.S. Defense Department said, citing privacy issues.The Defense Department Office of the Inspector General denied a Freedom of Information Act request from The Washington Post, which said it sought records of the inquiry into the relationship of Allen and Jill Kelley, who exchanged a myriad of emails and other documents. The Post said the denial was dated Feb. 15 but wasn't delivered to the newspaper until Monday. Pentagon officials said requests made by several other media organizations had also been rejected.In its denial letter to the Post, the inspector general's office said revealing records related to the Allen probe would "constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."The emails surfaced during an FBI investigation into other emails sent by Kelly that revealed former CIA chief David H. Petraeus -- who led the International Security Assistance Force and U.S. forces in Afghanistan -- had an extramarital liaison with his biographer. He resigned as CIA director in November.Allen announced last week he would retire from the military, saying he wanted to spend more time with his ailing wife. In retiring, Allen turned down an offer from President Obama to become NATO's supreme military commander for Europe.The Pentagon inspector general's office cleared Allen of any wrongdoing last month.

ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines, Sept. 18 (UPI) -- Philippine forces began clearing operations Wednesday in Zamboanga City after reclaiming 80 percent of areas from the attacking Muslim rebels, officials said.Lt. Col. Ramon Zagala, spokesman for the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said as much as 80 percent of the areas previously controlled by the rebels were now in government hands, the Philippines News Agency reported."We are currently pushing forward and in the areas we have recaptured, we have already started our clearing operations," he said, adding there had been no major incidents in the past 24 hours.A faction of the Moro National Liberation Front, identified as the Nur Misuari-led faction, attacked the largely Christian southern port city Sept. 9. The military was later called in as the rebels took control of several of the city's villages, leading to a standoff that left dozens, mostly rebels, dead. Authorities said the rebels also took dozens of civilians hostage, using some of them as human shields in gunfights with the military. Many of the hostages were subsequently released.ABS-CBN reported some renewed fighting Wednesday and fires in the conflict zone, including the village of Santa Catalina.The report quoted Zagala as saying the military is implementing a gradual constriction in the conflict areas to root out the rebels and rescue the hostages.In other developments, local police chief Jose Malayo, reportedly abducted by the rebels while conducting negotiations, has since been released along with 23 hostages, other reports said. ABS-CBN said the identities of the 23 were being verified.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (UPI) -- Why is the U.S. defense industry sector having such difficulty with producing so many ambitious programs like the Littoral Combat Ship, the Space-Based Infra Red System, and the Future Image Architecture program on budget and within reasonable time, compared with its triumphs of a generation ago? One major reason is that early triumphant programs were created by an earlier generation.

Wiki
Joseph Rudyard Kipling (30 December 1865 – 18 January 1936) was an English poet, short-story writer, and novelist chiefly remembered for his celebration of British imperialism, tales and poems of British soldiers in India, and his tales for children. Kipling received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907. He was born in Bombay, British India, and was taken by his family to England when he was five years old. Kipling is best known for his works of fiction, including The Jungle Book (1894) (a collection of stories which includes "Rikki-Tikki-Tavi"), Kim (1901) (a tale of adventure), many short stories, including "The Man Who Would Be King" (1888); and his poems, including Mandalay (1890), Gunga Din (1890), and If— (1910). He is regarded as a major "innovator in the art of the short story"; his children's books are enduring classics of children's literature; and his best works are said to exhibit "a versatile and luminous narrative gift".
Kipling was one of the most popular writers in England, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The author Henry James said of him: "Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius (as distinct from fine intelligence) that I have ever known." In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English language writer to receive the prize, and to date he remains its youngest recipient. Among other honours, he was sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, all of which he declined.
Kipling's subsequent reputation has changed according to the political and social climate of the age and the resulting contrasting views about him continued for much of the 20th century. A young George Orwell called him a "prophet of British imperialism". According to critic Douglas Kerr: "He is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes, he is recognised as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced. That, and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts, make him a force to be reckoned with."	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
