HOUSTON, July 26 (UPI) -- International gas sales volumes for the second quarter of 2013 were driven by the launch of the Tamar natural gas field off Israel, Noble Energy said.Noble said it sold a record 120 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2013, a 33 percent increase year-on-year. It attributed much of the increase to the start of sales from the Tamar natural gas field.Tamar went into service during the second quarter. Noble, which has headquarters in Houston, said more than 90 percent of the gross average Israeli production of 676 million cubic feet per day came from the Tamar field.Noble during the second quarter reported additional finds off Israel at the Karish natural gas field, said to hold more than 1.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas."Total discovered gross mean resources in the Levant basin [in the Mediterranean Sea] are now estimated to be approximately 38 trillion cubic feet," the company said in a Thursday statement.Noble Chairman Charles Davidson said his company expects to continue setting production records for the rest of the year.Noble reported a second quarter net profit of $377 million, up 29 percent year-on-year.

BOZEMAN, Mont., Feb. 12 (UPI) -- A new project to find ancient echoes from the birth of the universe -- gravitational shock waves left over from the Big Bang -- may help astronomers determine what happened at the moment of creation."The next new window on the universe in astronomy will surely be gravitational waves," University of Chicago astrophysicist and cosmology expert Michael Turner told United Press International.Studying gravity waves, Turner said, could allow us a glimpse of the universe "when it was only 10 to the minus-32 years old."Presently, astronomers cannot see farther back than about 300,000 years after the Big Bang, since present-day detectors are simply not sensitive enough to pick up the extremely low-frequency waves that still linger from the first nano-seconds after the Big Bang.As a solution, astrophysicists at Princeton University, the Goddard Space Flight Center and Montana State University have proposed to NASA the GREAT project -- for Gravitational Echoes Across Time."The mission proposal is completely new," physicist Neil Cornish told UPI from Bozeman. "The idea extends an existing mission concept -- the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna or LISA -- to much higher sensitivity and into a different frequency range." Missions such as LISA are designed to study another Big Bang relic-- the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB. These lukewarm, low-intensity light waves are "the after-glow of the Big Bang," Cornish said."The CMB originated from the hot charged plasma of the early universe as it cooled and expanded into a hot neutral gas, roughly 300,000 years after the Big Bang," he told UPI.The GREAT mission, he added, targets a much older Big Bang relic -- the Cosmic Gravitational Wave Background or CGB."Neither LIGO nor LISA have the sensitivity required to detect the cosmic gravitational wave background," Turner said. LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, is a ground based project designed to study non-background gravity waves from large scale, recent phenomena such as exploding or collapsing stars. "The cosmic gravitational wave background is thought to have been produced in the first tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang," Cornish told UPI.Measuring the CGB, Cornish explained, might well be the only way to discriminate between the two leading theories of creation -- inflation and string theory.In standard inflation models, the size or amplitude of gravity waves is independent of wave frequency. In string models, however, "the amplitude of the wave goes up and down, depending on the frequency," Cornish said. "By measuring the amplitude of the CGB at different frequencies, we can figure out what caused the waves and thereby what processes governed the creation of the universe."Constructing an apparatus to perform the measurements, however, will be a complex and expensive feat."The GREAT observatory works by using lasers to monitor the distance between a constellation of spacecraft," Cornish said. This distance -- tens of thousands of times larger than the radius of the Earth -- changes when a gravitational wave passes the spacecraft, stretching the fabric of space-time."Imagine a collection of dots on a rubber sheet," Cornish said. "The distance between the dots, like the spacecraft, increases and decreases with every stretch."Unlike the rubber sheet, however, "the gravitational waves we are looking for will change these distances by less than the radius of an atom," Cornish said. "GREAT will use lasers focused by large mirrors to make these precise distance measurements." Turner told UPI: "The payoff is really worth it. GREAT is a very ambitious goal, but we have a lot of clever minds and the rest of the century to make gravity waves the newest window on the universe."(Reported by Mike Martin in Columbia, Mo.)

CALGARY, Alberta, Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Jiri Hudler's third-period goal Tuesday boosted the Detroit Red Wings past Calgary 3-1 for their eighth win in their last eight games.Hudler scored on a backhander at 11:29 to snap a 1-1 tie and even the Wings' road record to 14-14-0.Cory Emmerton scored Detroit's first goal and Drew Miller added an insurance score at 15:58 of the third. Jimmy Howard stopped 28 shots in the victory.Mikka Kiprusoff allowed all three Detroit goals on 25 shots, including a clutch save on a breakaway by Jarome Iginla in the third period Michael Cammalleri accounted for Calgary's lone goal with a power-play score early in the second period that tied the score 1-1. The Flames, who have lost their last three home games, were 1-for-2 on the power play and killed all three of Detroit's power plays.

| License Photo	AMMAN, Jordan, May 3 (UPI) -- King Abdullah II of Jordan has sworn in a new government in a long-running political drama in which the Hashemite kingdom's vaunted intelligence service, a close U.S. ally in the fight against al-Qaida, plays a critical role.Indeed, the Dairat al-Mukhabarat al-Ammah, or General Intelligence Directorate, often seems to be at odds with the monarch's avowed intent to introduce political reforms.That's a policy that has taken on greater urgency for the monarch who has seen four longtime Arab dictators swept from power in the pro-democracy uprisings that erupted across the Middle East in January 2011.The GID has long been a pillar of the monarchy, as intelligence services have been for other Arab regimes, and as such it is widely seen as a powerful arm of the regime that is used to stifle, or crush, dissent.Over the years, heads of the GID have often seemed interchangeable with prime ministers.So one of the main demands of the growing body of protesters, led by the Muslim Brotherhood, seeking sweeping reforms, is the curbing of GID's powers.The International Crisis Group, a Brussels think tank and conflict resolution center, observed in a March analysis of popular protest in Jordan, that "ending -- or at least dramatically reducing -- the political role of unelected bodies, the security services prime among them," would go a long way to dampening the protest movement.Since he ascended the throne in 1999 following the death of his much-revered father, King Hussein, Abdullah has constantly changed prime ministers and shuffled Cabinets to ward off persistent demands for political and economic reform or to bolster support among the Bedouin tribes.They have formed the backbone of the monarchy since it was established by Britain after World War I in what was then known as Transjordan.A week ago, Prime Minister Awn Shawkat al-Khasawneh, a prominent jurist, suddenly resigned only six months after Abdullah had appointed him to replace Marouf al-Bakhit, a former army major general and ex-head of the GID.On Wednesday, the king swore in Khasawneh's successor, Fayez al-Tarawneh, a U.S.-educated leading conservative. He is the 10th prime minister Abdullah has named in his 13-year-old reign, and the fourth in the last 14 months, the period that covers the political convulsions of the so-called Arab Spring.These changes have all been triggered by the growing pressure for change in an Arab state that's squeezed between Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Syria, one of the most volatile regions on the planet.Abdullah has found himself trapped: promising reforms that are blocked by conservative forces, such as the intelligence service and the Old Guard who run the royal court who don't want to see their power and privileges taken away.Khasawneh's surprise resignation -- submitted by letter while abroad -- illustrates the intrigues behind the political maneuvering in Jordan.The royal palace, apparently taken unawares and anxious to deflect criticism of the king, put it about that Khasawneh was less than enthusiastic about reform but insiders say he was frustrated at how his efforts to bring about meaningful political change were being sabotaged by the power elite.Politicians said he had been caught up in a power struggle with the GID, which is accused of widening its already formidable influence into public life.But the key element appears to have been Khasawneh's drive to root out deeply entrenched official corruption, a campaign that led to judicial probes against senior establishment figures."Khasawneh took office widely seen as a reformist and a liberal politician … sharply critical of how the country was being managed," said political analyst Mohammad Abu Rumman of the University of Jordan."He expressed his intention to bring an end to intervention by the intelligence department in public affairs."Several GID chiefs have been implicated in corruption in recent years and two have served jail time. But Abdullah has dismissed others he thought were becoming too involved in politics, the preserve of the royal court.Khasawneh's predecessor, Bakhit had promised to change elections laws, decentralize authority and give political parties more rights.Islamists accused him of stalling on reform and being lenient on corruption. Abdullah accepted his resignation Oct. 17, 2011.Insiders predict Tarawneh's tenure will likely be brief. Meantime, they say, Abdullah's running out of time.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (UPI) -- Calculating the costs associated with U.S. President Obama's second inaugural is proving difficult, with some costs a closely guarded secret, ABC News reported.The total cost of Obama's first inauguration in 2009 was $170 million. Second inaugurals typically are less costly than first inaugurals, and estimated spending so far on Obama's inauguration Monday comes to $13.637 million, but it will probably amount to much more than that, ABC said Saturday.One of the biggest unknowns is how much money has been raised by the Presidential Inaugural Committee, which funds certain parts of the quadrennial event such as the parade and the inaugural balls. The committee collected $53 million in 2009, with donations banned from unions and corporations -- a ban that has been dropped this year.Taxpayers foot the bill for the swearing-in ceremony and the congressional luncheon, with spending on those items controlled by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. This year, they have a budget of $1.237 million, down about $163,000 from four years ago.There's a host of other groups who'll need money for the event too.Local and state government and the National Park Service were reimbursed $22 million in 2009, the Congressional Research Service says. That figure is conservative, as officials from the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland estimated their needs at $75 million.So far, the park service has been allocated $1.2 million for this year's celebration.The cost for security is unknown. The Secret Service and District of Columbia police and fire and emergency services don't report such budgets for security reasons.Another unknown is what the president might say, and how long he might say it, CNN reported.Some second-term inaugural speeches, like that of Ulysses S. Grant, ended on a note of vindication, while Lincoln's mentioned union and charity and the binding of wounds.Beginning his second term, George Washington uttered only 135 words, compared to the 1,428 for his first inauguration. Franklin Roosevelt's fourth address lasted 5 minutes.

| License Photo	BEIJING, July 26 (UPI) -- Beijing police have told cafes, hotels and other businesses in the city to install surveillance technology for WiFi users or face fines and possible closure.The move, the latest by the Chinese government to tighten Internet controls and access, follows the Middle Eastern uprisings in which the Internet and social networks played a pivotal role, The Guardian newspaper in Britain reported Tuesday.Beijing businesses have been ordered to install monitoring software, which costs around $3,100, which will allow the authorities to check the identities of WiFi users and monitor their Internet activity.Businesses that fail to comply face a fine and could have their licenses revoked."This is undoubtedly an invasion of WiFi users' privacy," Jason Chen, a 22-year-old Beijing resident, said."We have already felt the restriction on university campuses, since they have always been monitored. But this time, the control is stretching to cafes and people's feeling of violation is sharper."Some Beijing businesses said they were already losing customers after cutting off WiFi."It is just unbelievable. Customers are not happy either," Leona Zhang, manager of the Contempio bar, said.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands, Jan. 23 (UPI) -- Security camera videotape just before the explosion that killed former Lebanon Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was played Thursday for an international tribunal. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon, sitting in The Hague, Netherlands, must decide if five members of Hezbollah were involved in Hariri's assassination. Four are being tried in absentia, the (Beirut) Daily Star reported. Footage from a security camera at an HSBC bank shows what is alleged to be a Mitsubishi Canter van being driven very slowly along the street in Beirut where Hariri's convoy was about to pass. A minute later, the convoy goes by and then, soon after, the image is obliterated by a dust cloud. Cameras at the bank also captured pedestrians reacting to the enormous explosion and a bright flash of light. Prosecutors say the Mitsubishi van was loaded with 2 tons of explosive. Hariri and 21 other people were killed on Feb. 14, 2005. The trial began last week with opening statements from both sides that concluded Monday. Thursday was the second day of testimony, the Daily Star said. Robyn Fraser, an expert witness, testified that the van appeared to be the same one captured by other cameras at the Phoenicia Hotel. Prosecutors say they have evidence that members of Hezbollah bought a Mitsubishi Canter van. Defense lawyers plan to object that the van seen on the cameras was a Mitsubishi, the Star said.
