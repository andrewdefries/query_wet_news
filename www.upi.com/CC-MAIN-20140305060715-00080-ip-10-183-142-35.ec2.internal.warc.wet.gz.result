NEW DELHI, Aug. 28 (UPI) -- French energy company GDF Suez said it signed a deal with GAIL (India) Ltd. for the shipment of nearly 1 million tons of liquefied natural gas.The companies signed a medium-term agreement for the supply for 12 LNG cargoes from GDF Suez through 2014. The shipments will total 800,000 tons.B C Tripathi, chairman and managing director at GAIL, said the agreement would help offset the country's supply deficit."GAIL will continue to make assiduous efforts to tie-up affordable LNG in its portfolio to meet the rapidly growing energy demand of the Indian market," he said in a statement.GDF Suez said it expects the Indian natural gas market will grow 87 percent from 2012-20.This agreement with GDF Suez is yet another step by GAIL to bridge the demand supply deficit of the Indian market in the medium term," said Tripathi.GAIL operates more than 5,900 miles of pipelines in India capable of handling around 6 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day.High demand and grid failures left half of India without power near the end of July.

LOS ANGELES, June 23 (UPI) -- Paris Jackson may go to a long-term treatment center after she is released from a psychiatric facility in Los Angeles, a source close to her family told People.The 15-year-old daughter of late pop music icon Michael Jackson has been at UCLA Medical Center since June 5 when she cut her wrists with a kitchen knife and ingested numerous Motrin pills."Paris will be staying at least another week, and then she'll be going to a facility for additional care," the source, whose name was not reported, said.Paris' co-guardians, her grandmother Katherine Jackson and biological mother Debbie Rowe, consulted with doctors and decided to move her to an out-of-state, long-term facility, People reported.The decision is based, in part, on the fact that Katherine Jackson fears her granddaughter had "fallen in with the wrong crowd" in Los Angeles.

| License Photo	ATLANTA, June 14 (UPI) -- No cases of the SARS-like virus are reported in the United States, but any case of lower respiratory illness after Arabian Peninsula travel should be reported.A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the continued reporting of new cases indicates there is an ongoing risk for transmission to humans in the Arabian Peninsula area.All reported cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus were directly or indirectly linked to one of four countries: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. Forty cases were reported by Saudi Arabia. The United Kingdom, Italy, France and Tunisia reported cases involving travelers to the Arabian Peninsula and close contacts. The original source or sources, route of transmission to humans and the mode of human-to-human transmission have not been determined, the report said. Eight clusters involving 42 cases reported by France, Italy, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and the United Kingdom were among close contacts or in healthcare settings and provide clear evidence of human-to-human transmission, the report said. Patients who develop severe acute lower respiratory illness within 14 days after traveling from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries should be evaluated according to the guidelines at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/case-def.html, CDC officials said. Those whose respiratory illness remains unexplained and who meet criteria for "patient under investigation" should be reported immediately to CDC via state and local health departments, the report said. The report was published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

BALTIMORE, March 30 (UPI) -- The mascot for this year's Preakness, a drunken centaur, is meant to draw fans to the race, but some say they are horrified. Kegasus, a "party manimal" sporting a nipple ring, body hair and beer gut, was announced by the host Maryland Jockey Club Tuesday. He will be promising a rowdy party at the May 21 Triple Crown race via television, radio, social media and appearances targeting the under-40 crowd."Kegasus speaks directly to our infield fest demographic with his no-nonsense personality and total embodiment of a good time," Jockey Club President Tom Chuckas said.Brian Eden, a marketing executive not involved in the campaign, told The Baltimore Sun: "Their mission is pretty clear here. They're not talking to the ladies with the big flowered hats in the grandstand."The promotion drew immediate fire for promoting binge drinking."If the goal is to let them know they will be able to drink to excess, it does communicate that," said Jason Loviglio, a University of Maryland media professor. Fans will be invited "to pursue sunstroke and alcohol poisoning." Chuckas said the jockey club has "never hidden the fact that we want people to come to the infield and party."

AMITY, Ore., June 14 (UPI) -- An unusual two-faced kitten died Thursday two days after its birth in Amity, Ore., in spite of its owner's regular feedings with an eyedropper. Stephanie Durkee told KGW-TV the kitten's mother had rejected the newborn, refusing to feed it. Durkee, who named the kitten Deucy, said its health deteriorated quickly. The kitten, who had two healthy littermates with normal faces, suffered from a disorder known as diprosopus. Cats with the disorder are also known as Janus Cats after the two-faced Roman god Janus, who also gave his name to the month of January. Durkee's veterinarian told The (Portland) Oregonian most kittens born with two faces die soon after birth, although he has heard of a few surviving to be adults. One lived to be 12 years old.

YUMA, Ariz., Aug. 12 (UPI) -- A legal fight begun by a small Native American tribe over a construction project in Yuma, Ariz., could potentially redefine the concept of sacred land.While current federal law protects tribes' religious or burial sites, a lawsuit introduced by a Quechan Indian leader is seeking to include potential tribal sites to that protected list as well, The New York Times said Sunday.Mike Jackson, whose tribe has about 3,300 members, is attempting to stop the creation of a $4 billion oil refinery by alleging tribal artifacts may exist on its construction site.In his suit, Jackson demands a lengthy and costly archaeological investigation be launched at the site to determine if his claim has merit. The demand comes despite claims by officials at Arizona Clean Fuels, the company behind the refinery, that no tribal artifacts have been found near the site.The Times said if Jackson is successful in his efforts, his case could redefine what is considered sacred tribal land and open the door for additional lawsuits from other U.S. tribes.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 (UPI) -- It's crunch time at the U.S. Supreme Court this week for proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage as the high court, like Oz, retreats behind the curtain to work its magic.The nine justices are scheduled to conference behind closed doors Friday and decide -- or delay deciding -- whether to hear any of the five challenges to the Defense of Marriage Act or California's Proposition 8 case.The odds appear good they will accept at least one of the DOMA cases and the Prop 8 case. All six of the petitions were scheduled to be considered Nov. 20, but were delayed until next Friday, Nov. 30.Some major media outlets are reporting the justices eventually may decide whether same-sex marriages must be allowed. But when it can, the high court avoids making sweeping constitutional rulings and tries to find the narrow path to a decision. Some of the issues may involve "standing" -- whether a person or a group has suffered an injury and therefore has the right to challenge or defend a law.Another factor favoring the acceptance of the cases: Only four votes out of nine are needed to grant a writ of certiorari -- or acceptance of review -- so that a case can be heard. DOMA and Prop 8 all have taken a beating in the lower courts.The Supreme Court's four-member conservative bloc -- five if you include swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy -- might be inclined to grant review to either save DOMA or Prop 8, or write an opinion that gives Congress and the states some guidance on same-sex marriage.The federal Defense of Marriage Act says federal benefits and considerations for married couples apply only to heterosexual unions.The Obama administration is enforcing the 1996 act, but is one of the main challengers in court.The entire law is not under attack. Section 2 says no state is required "to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of another state that treats a relationship between two persons of the same sex as a marriage under its laws." In other words, the law says a same-sex marriage in Maryland, Maine and Washington state, which just approved such unions, would not necessarily have to be recognized in any other state.None of the challenges targets Section 2. Section 3, which is targeted in all the DOMA cases, says, "In determining the meaning of any act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word 'marriage' means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word 'spouse' refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.""Although Section 3 of DOMA does not purport to invalidate same-sex marriages in those states that permit them," the administration told the Supreme Court in a petition brief, "it excludes such marriages from recognition for purposes of more than 1,000 federal statutes and programs whose administration turns in part on individuals' marital status. ... Section 3 of DOMA thus denies to legally married same-sex couples many substantial benefits otherwise available to legally married opposite-sex couples under federal employment, immigration, public health and welfare, tax and other laws."With the administration refusing to defend DOMA, U.S. House Republican leaders took up the banner. A group called the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives, or BLAG, filed its own petition to the U.S. Supreme Court in the Massachusetts case, and has filed friend-of-the-court briefs in other DOMA cases."DOMA does not bar or invalidate any marriages but leaves states free to decide whether they will recognize same-sex marriage," the BLAG petition said. " ... Section 3 of DOMA simply asserts the federal government's right as a separate sovereign to provide its own definition, which 'governs only federal programs and funding.'" Moreover, Congress did its own research before passing DOMA, the BLAG petition said."Before enacting DOMA [in 1996], Congress received and considered advice on its constitutionality and determined that DOMA is constitutional" after consulting a number of political and academic sources. "Congress specifically sought constitutional advice from the executive branch, and the Justice Department under the Clinton administration advised Congress three times that DOMA was constitutional."In addition, the executive branch has a "constitutional duty to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed,'" the BLAG petition said in footnote, citing Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution. The petition said the Justice Department during the Bush administration successfully defended the act several times."This court 'does and should accord a strong presumption of constitutionality to acts of Congress. This is not a mere polite gesture. It is a deference due to deliberate judgment by constitutional majorities of the two Houses of Congress that an act is [constitutional],'" the petition said, citing a 1953 high court precedent.California voters approved Proposition 8, the California Marriage Protection Act, in 2008 with slightly more than 52 percent for, nearly 48 percent against. Prop 8 said in part, "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California."An earlier, similar measure, Proposition 22, was overturned by a ruling from the California Supreme Court. For Prop 8, opponents went to federal court where a federal judge declared it unconstitutional. A three-judge appeals court panel in San Francisco agreed 2-1.The petition to the Supreme Court filed by ProtectMarriage -- its sponsor is a state non-profit, California Renewal -- argues the appeals court misinterpreted Supreme Court precedent. It also argues the state has a compelling interest in limiting marriage to a woman and a man."The unique procreative potential of sexual relationships between men and women implicates vital social interests," the petition said. "On the one hand, procreation is necessary to the survival and perpetuation of society and, indeed, the human race; accordingly, the responsible creation, nurture, and socialization of the next generation is a vital -- indeed existential -- social good."The petition said: "A central purpose of marriage in virtually every society ... is and always has been to regulate sexual relationships between men and women so that the unique procreative capacity of such relationships benefits rather than harms society. In particular, through the institution of marriage, societies seek to increase the likelihood that children will be born and raised in stable and enduring family units by both the mothers and the fathers who brought them into this world."With U.S. Supreme Court evenly divided by the four-member liberal bloc and four-member conservative bloc, the fate of DOMA or Prop 8 might come down to swing vote Kennedy.Kennedy most often votes with the conservative bloc, allowing it to rule the roost at the high court.But proponents of same-sex marriage might take comfort in two older opinions written by Kennedy and often reviewed by United Press International.In 1996's Romer vs. Evans, a number of Colorado municipalities had passed "ordinances banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing, employment, education, public accommodations, health and welfare services, and other transactions and activities."But in a statewide referendum, Colorado voters adopted Amendment 2 to the state Constitution, which banned legislative, executive or judicial action at any level of state or local government designed to protect the status of persons based on their "homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships."The affected communities filed suit and a state judge issued a preliminary injunction declaring Amendment 2 invalid. The judge was sustained by the Colorado Supreme Court.Then the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6-3 majority opinion written by Kennedy, said Amendment 2 violated the U.S. Constitution's equal protection clause."We must conclude that Amendment 2 classifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else," Kennedy wrote. "This Colorado cannot do. A state cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws."Justice Scalia led the dissenters, saying, "Today's opinion has no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely pretends to."In 2003's Lawrence vs. Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a state appellate court and declared the Lone Star State's sodomy law unconstitutional. In a 6-3 opinion, Kennedy said the statute violated the U.S. Constitution's due process -- or fair proceedings -- clause. Kennedy basically told government to get out of the bedroom."Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places," he wrote. "In our tradition the state is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the state should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression and certain intimate conduct."Again, Scalia led the dissenters, saying almost prophetically, "One of the benefits of leaving regulation of this matter to the people rather than to the courts is that the people, unlike judges, need not carry things to their logical conclusion. The people may feel that their disapprobation of homosexual conduct is strong enough to disallow homosexual marriage, but not strong enough to criminalize private homosexual acts -- and may legislate accordingly. The [Supreme] Court majority today pretends that it possesses a similar freedom of action, so that we need not fear judicial imposition of homosexual marriage, as has recently occurred in Canada [in a decision that the Canadian government has chosen not to appeal]. ..."At the end of its opinion -- after having laid waste the foundations of our rational-basis jurisprudence -- the [Supreme] Court [majority] says that the present case 'does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.' ... Do not believe it."

BUFFALO, N.Y., Feb. 6 (UPI) -- An after-school program teacher was charged with bringing a loaded handgun into a Buffalo, N.Y., school Thursday, authorities said.While Dwayne Ferguson of Buffalo was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a weapon, authorities said they didn't believe he had any ill intent, WIVB-TV, Buffalo, reported.The 4:15 p.m. EST incident prompted a lockdown that drew a heavy police response to Harvey Austin Elementary School, a public school serving students from kindergarten to eighth grade on Buffalo's East Side, the Tonawanda News reported. There were about 60 children in the building at the time, WIVB-TV said.Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said a caller to the emergency dispatch center reported seeing a man with a gun inside or on the campus.An initial search by law enforcement officers failed to turn up a weapon but the teacher allegedly was found with the gun during a second round of searching, the newspaper said.City police department spokesman George DeGeorge said while Ferguson has a permit for the gun, it is a felony for non-law enforcement personnel to carry firearms on school grounds in New York state.Authorities said Ferguson is not a Buffalo school system employee but is a regular participant in after-school programming at the school.

FREDERICTON, New Brunswick, Nov. 30 (UPI) -- Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers seized the uniform of a fellow Mountie, who says he should be allowed to smoke medical marijuana while in uniform.Cpl. Ronald Francis, of New Brunswick, told CBC News two officers showed up at his home Thursday and one took his regular working uniform and "anything that identified me as a member of the RCMP: My work shirts, work pants, my jackets, my gloves, my hat, my cap badge.""I worked hard for that uniform," he said. "I bled for that uniform. I cried for that uniform for 21 years ... . They ordered me to give the only thing that I've lived and identified with for 21 years."Francis said his red serge uniform was not seized, because it was at his girlfriend's house, but he was ordered to turn it in to the commissioner at J Division Friday.He said he had been told by officers in the past not to smoke marijuana while in uniform, but he didn't listen to them because he uses the drug to calm down and reduce his symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder."Definitely a member that has been prescribed medicinal marijuana should not be in red serge taking his medication," said RCMP assistant Commissioner Gilles Moreau. "It would not be advisable for that member, it would not portray the right message to the general public, it's definitely not something we would support or condone."
