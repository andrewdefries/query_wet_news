| License Photo	WOBURN, Mass., May 7 (UPI) -- A Massachusetts aerospace company has unveiled its second generation flying car, even though it has yet to deliver any of it first generation vehicles.The firm, Terrafugia, however, has to be taken seriously, said Roadable Times editor John Brown, because "They have a track record of doing what they say," he said.The firm has more than 100 orders for its first flying car -- or, put another way, it's first road-worthy airplane.USA Today reported Tuesday that the first Terrafugia multi-medium vehicle is called the Transition and has a sticker price of $279,000.The Transition has folding wings that, when unfolded, allow the car to take off using a runway, like an airplane. The next generation, however, will have tilt-rotor technology that would allow the car to lift off like a helicopter, the newspaper said.Propellers would give it a nearly vertical lift-off. Those propellers would then rotate, turning the car into a prop-driven airplane.That would be, essentially, three or maybe four vehicles in one. The TF-X, as it is called, would not just be a car and a plane, but a car-plane-helicopter-hovercraft."We felt this was our time to share our vision of the future," said Richard Gersh, vice president of Terrafugia. Gersh says deliveries are not around the corner, but "if you don't start today, it won't happen."

TEL AVIV, Israel, June 28 (UPI) -- As the Middle East descends deeper into conflict, Israel's military is set to deploy its sixth Iron Dome counter-rocket battery, produced by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, and is preparing to take delivery of the first unit of David's Sling, another Rafael anti-missile system.The new Iron Dome battery, intended to shoot down short-range missiles like the Soviet-designed Grads used by Lebanon's Hezbollah and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, has been upgraded and its range extended. That means the system, the only combat-tested weapon in the multilayered anti-missile shield Israel is building, can intercept hostile rockets earlier in their trajectory and minimize damage and casualties.Iron Dome, heavily funded by the United States, became operational in early 2011.The fifth and sixth batteries received by the air force, which has control of all air defenses, are improved versions of a system that currently has a kill rate of around 85 percent of those rockets it engages. The sixth battery is expected to be deployed within two months, and could be delivered as early as July.The Jerusalem Post reported that two further batteries could be deployed by January 2014.Military planners have said they need 20 Iron Dome batteries to cover all of Israel, although the new-model systems, which can cover wider areas than the earlier variants and intercept multiple targets coming from different directions, may mean that fewer batteries will be required.Israel's Defense Ministry, hit by budgetary cuts, has had to turn to Washington for funds to buy the batteries, which cost more than $50 million apiece.The Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency included $220 million in its annual budget in March for Israel to buy more Iron Dome batteries in fiscal 2014. That was the first time the MDA had specifically sought funds for Iron Dome, underlining the U.S. Defense Department's commitment to maintain military aid for Israel, outside the $3.1 billion it gets every year, despite major cuts in U.S. defense spending.The U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee approved a $284 million funding increase June 6 for Israel's anti-missile shield, including an additional $15 million for the Iron Dome program.The United States provided $205 million in 2011 for the Israeli air force to buy the first four Iron Dome batteries.Iron Dome is the bottom tier of the four-level anti-missile shield the Israelis call "Homa," the wall, which will protect the tiny Mediterranean state against the short-range Grads, the longer range Iranian-built Zelzals and Fateh-110s possess by Hezbollah and Iran's strategic Shehab-3 intermediate–range ballistic missiles -- with more advanced Sejjil-2 weapons in the pipeline -- and Syria's Scud-D weapons.David's Sling, being developed by Rafael and the Raytheon Co. of the United States, was unveiled at the Paris Air Show this month. Until then, all that Israelis been seen of it was a brief video of a secret test in the Negev Desert of southern Israel in November 2012.Also known as Magic Wand, David's Sling is designed to intercept medium-range missiles at a range of 100 miles.It's the next layer in the shield above Iron Dome and underwent its first test-flight in February. It's scheduled to become operational in 2014. Each missile costs $1 million.After that comes Arrow-2, developed by state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries. The $1 billion program was heavily financed by the Americans. Two Arrow-2 batteries are known to have been deployed to intercept ballistic missiles at high altitude and long range.A more advanced variant, Arrow-3, is currently being developed by IAI and the Boeing Co. of the United States. It will be more powerful, capable of intercepting missiles at altitudes of 70 miles or more outside Earth's atmosphere earlier in their trajectories than Arrow-2.The primary function of the road-mobile David's Sling system in Israel's current threat environment is to counter the medium-range missiles like the Fateh-100s that Hezbollah now has in considerable numbers north of Israel and which can reach pretty much anywhere inside the Jewish state, including all its cities and major towns.David's Sling will be able to backstop the two Arrow variants against ballistic and cruise missiles that get past them. It can cover all of Israel from a small number of launch sites around the country.

COLUMBIA, S.C., Sept. 18 (UPI) -- A 16-year-old South Carolina girl may hold the record as the state's youngest female to bag an alligator, a state alligator expert said. Cammie Colin, who won one of 1,000 slots in an annual lottery for permission to hunt an alligator, headed out before the sun rose Sunday to hunt her prey in the headwaters of Lake Marion, S. C., The State reported. Hunting alligators at night "takes a person who may just be a little more daring than the average person," said Jay Butfiloski, an alligator expert with the state Department of Natural Resources.Colin's hunt was a team effort, which involved shooting the alligator with a crossbow with a line attached. The animal then pulled the boat, with five team members inside, for over an hour, until it wore out. Then family friend and guide Jay Iadonisi shot the animal in the head to kill it. "My classmates were amazed," Colin said. "They didn't think I was serious about going gator hunting."Colin's family now has a refrigerator full of alligator steaks, and she has a new nickname at school – "Killer."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 (UPI) -- Log-in details of 1.6 million accounts on the websites of NASA, the FBI and the European Space Agency have been hacked and posted online, authorities say.The data was gathered during a series of attacks by the hacktivist group Ghost Shell on those sites and of those of many other government agencies and contractors, the BBC reported Wednesday.The posted data included log-in names, passwords, email addresses and resumes.In a statement posted on the Web, Ghost Shell said the attacks were part of its campaign to promote freedom of information online.It said it had sent messages to those in charge of the security of about 150 servers it considered insecure and targeted with the attacks.A total of 37 separate organizations and businesses including contractors and companies doing business with the U.S Department of Defense were targeted by Ghost Shell.The group, which grew out of the Anonymous hacking collective, has been responsible for a number of attacks in 2012 on businesses, universities and Russian government departments, the BBC said.

FARMINGDALE, N.Y., Aug. 24 (UPI) -- Sergio Garcia, who broke a four-year winless streak on the PGA Tour last week, moved into a share of the lead Friday at the midway point of The Barclays.With a win in the opening event of the tour's four-tournament playoff stretch, Garcia would take over the top spot in the FedEx Cup points chase.He shot a 3-under 68 at the Bethpage State Park Black Course Friday for a two-day total of 8-under 134. That tied him for the lead with Nick Watney, who began last year's playoffs in first place and wound up ninth.Watney shot a 69 that included an eagle at the par-5 fourth hole.Vijay Singh, 49, and Bob Estes, 46, shared third place at 135 while John Senden and Pat Perez were tied at 136.Among those at 137 was Tiger Woods, who played in obvious discomfort throughout the round due to a sore back that he said came from sleeping on a soft mattress at his hotel."It hurt all day," said Woods, who was the points leader at the start of the playoffs and who shot a 69 to tie Rickie Fowler, John Huh and Gary Christian for ninth place.First-round leader Padraig Harrington bogeyed the first three holes Friday, shot a 75 and finished 36 holes at 139 in a tie for 16th place.World No. 1 Rory McIlroy, playing for the first time since he won the PGA Championship by eight shots, was at 142 after shooting a 73. Phil Mickelson was also at 142 following a 74.The playoffs began with 125 players still eligible to win the FedEx Cup and its accompanying prize of $10 million.That number will be reduced to 100 after this tournament and among those who were certain to miss out on the rest of the playoffs was U.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III.Love began the playoffs in 105th place and he missed the cut at this tournament with a 148 total.Among those who gave themselves a chance for a big move up the points list during the opening two rounds was Christian, who was in 111th place going into the playoffs.A finish among the Top 10 this week would guarantee him not only a spot among the 100 players who will compete at next week's Deutsche Bank Championship, but would also ensure him a position in the field of 70 that will play at the BMW Championship.Only the first 30 on the points list will play in the Tour Championship, the final tournament of the playoffs.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 (UPI) -- A higher number of Jewish Republican congressional candidates in 2012 raises the possibility of a greater presence for the bloc on Capitol Hill, insiders said.Right now, only House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia is Jewish, but observers say this could change in the 2012 election cycle, particularly in the Senate where three Jewish Republicans are running in competitive 2012 races, Roll Call reported Monday.Seeking to be the party nominee in competitive Senate races are former Hawaii Gov. Linda Lingle, Adam Hasner in Florida and Josh Mandel in Ohio."We are blessed with many. The harvest is bountiful," said former Sen. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., who is Jewish. "There's a real possibility of [getting two or three Republican Jews elected to] the Senate. It's been a pretty exclusive club."Coleman, who lost a 2008 recount battle in mid-2009 to Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., was one of the last Jewish Republicans in the Senate. Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania left the GOP to become a Democrat. (Specter lost a re-election bid in 2010.)Twenty-four Jewish Democrats are House members and 12 Jewish Democrats are in the Senate, Roll Call said.Jewish Republican donors climbed to prominence and power during the last 10 years, working to build a national network of financial support for candidates, Roll Call said. Last week, nearly every Republican presidential hopeful spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition's presidential forum in Washington.

MIAMI, June 14 (UPI) -- A deck at a Miami-area sports bar collapsed during Thursday's NBA Finals game, pitching dozens of people into Biscayne Bay. Emergency workers said about 100 people were on the deck at Shuckers Waterfront Grill in North Bay Village watching the Miami Heat play the San Antonio Spurs, The Miami Herald reported. The collapse occurred at around 9:45 p.m., just before halftime. Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Capt. Eugene Germain Jr. said at least 15 people were transported to hospitals, including one in serious condition. Fire officials said rescue divers were searching the bay around the restaurant and at least one person might be missing. Germain said the total number of injured was well over 20. The deck was about 5 feet above the water's surface. Crystal Infante, 23, who was at the restaurant with a friend, said the water was shallow enough to stand but it became full of broken wood, tables, chairs and struggling people. "There was just a crack, and then we were in the water," she said. "It was really hard to get out, and you couldn't find anyone."

ALMATY, Kazakhstan, Feb. 27 (UPI) -- Iran and six other nations agreed to gather technical experts in March and return to full talks on Iran's nuclear program in April, a diplomat said Wednesday.Saeed Jalili, Iran's chief negotiator, said participants at the Almaty, Kazakhstan, talks presented "more realistic proposals that come a little closer to Iran's position," The New York Times reported."Their proposals seem more realistic and positive," Jalili said, adding there have been "some changes in their viewpoint." The two days of talks were called to get a clear response from Iran to an offer of gradual relief from sanctions in return for measures that inspire confidence about Iran's intent for its nuclear program, Western diplomats said. The diplomats said the technical meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, would be to detail the proposals before returning to Almaty to listen to Iran's response. The talks have been intermittent since they began in October 2009, with the last meeting eight months ago in Moscow. As a first step, the six powers -- permanent U.N. Security Council members China, Britain, France, Russia and the United States, plus Germany -- want Iran to end uranium enrichment to 20 percent and to export its stockpile of more highly enriched uranium, which can turned into bomb-grade material more quickly, the Times said. The powers also want Iran to shutter its Fordo enrichment facility, which Iran so far has refused to do.In return, the six countries have offered Iran sanctions relief, reportedly including permission to resume trading of gold and precious metals, as well as resuming some international banking activity and petroleum trading, the Times said. The ultimate goal of the talks is to get Iran to comply with Security Council resolutions that it stop enrichment completely until it can satisfy the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nation's nuclear watchdog, that it has no weapons program and no hidden enrichment sites. In return, all sanctions, which have crippled Iran's economy, would be lifted. Iran meanwhile, has created a plan B for nuclear weapons capacity in a second plant, satellite images commissioned by Britain's The Daily Telegraph indicated.The IR-40 40-megawatt thermal nuclear reactor in Arak -- said by the regime of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to produce power and isotopes -- has begun heavy-water production.The images, taken Feb. 9, show signs of activity at the Arak plant, 150 miles southwest of Tehran, including a cloud of steam analysts said indicates heavy-water production.The images also show surface-to-air missile and artillery sites to protect the plant.Western governments and the IAEA have privately had information about the Arak activity for some time, the Telegraph said.Israel has warned it may carry out military strikes to stop Iran from gaining nuclear-weapons capacity. Washington says it won't rule out using force but prefers diplomacy.Russian envoy Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, a staunch opponent to increasing sanctions, said time is running out for the talks. Russia's Interfax news agency reported Ryabkov as saying easing sanctions would be possible only if Iran could offer assurances its nuclear program was exclusively for peaceful purposes, as the Islamic republic has maintained. "There is no certainty that the Iranian nuclear program lacks a military dimension, although there is also no evidence that there is a military dimension," he said. Russian leaders hope the talks would move into a "bargaining" phase."There needs to be a political will to move into that phase," Ryabkov said. "We call on all participants not to lose any more time."
