ABUJA, Nigeria, Feb. 6 (UPI) -- Attacks on Nigerian oil production will be used to drive energy companies from the Niger Delta, a militant group said.The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta took responsibility for an attack on an oil pipeline operated by Italian energy company Eni. MEND, in a statement published by Nigerian news agency Vanguard, said the disruption of around 4,000 barrels of oil per day was a warning of things to come."This relatively insignificant attack is a reminder of our presence in the creeks of the Niger Delta and a sign of things to come," MEND said. "Our silence thus far has been strategic and, at the right time, we will reduce Nigerian oil production to zero and drive off our land thieving oil companies."MEND leader Henry Okah is under arrest in South Africa. The group, in its latest statement, blamed the South African government for interfering in state affairs.MEND added that it recognized Nigeria relies heavily on oil revenue but said the "floundering government of Nigeria is more concerned with enriching themselves than attending to the problems of the Niger Delta and the continuously depreciating standard of living of the ordinary Nigerian."Nigeria is trying to cope with a threat from domestic insurgent group Boko Haram, which seeks an Islamic state in a country divided largely along Christian and Muslim lines.

ERIE, Pa., Jan. 30 (UPI) -- Train releases its fifth album, "For Me, It's You," comfortable that there's an audience waiting to hear it -- especially among U.S. radio listeners."I feel like we've established ourselves as a career band, and we'll continue to do that," says frontman Pat Monahan, who co-founded the band in Erie, Pa., and co-wrote hits such as "Drops of Jupiter" and "Calling All Angels."Nevertheless, Monahan says that he and his bandmates "like writing songs that appeal to radio. I like being part of that world, the pop culture. We've been doing that for awhile, so there's really everything to gain and nothing to lose at this point."Train celebrates the new album's release Tuesday with an appearance on NBC's "Today" show. The group will also appear this week on "The WB Morning Show," "The Late Show With David Letterman," the "CBS Saturday Morning Early Show" and the Pepsi Smash Super Bowl Concert Series, which is being taped Thursday in Detroit as part of the Super Bowl XL festivities and will air Saturday on VH1.

{WOMENSENEWS}--The future of pregnant women in the United States is on the threshold of dramatic change. Aug. 1 marks the day insurance providers and Medicaid will be required to cover preventative care for women.But it doesn't stop there. By 2014, health insurance providers will be required to cover the full fee for reproductive health care--from contraception to post-natal checkups. Imagine, life without a co-pay for annual checkups, birth control visits and post-natal care.Yet, America remains a part of an even more exclusive club. It is one of 23 countries where maternal mortality is steadily on the rise. The U.S. maternal mortality rates are higher--that is, proportionately more U.S. pregnant women or new mothers are dying--than in 49 other countries.Final maternal mortality data for 2010 are not yet available but the numbers suggest a startling reminder that America has the highest maternal mortality rate of any industrialized country. In 2009, 16.1 women died per 100,000 lives births; two years before, 12. 7 women died per 100,000 live births, according to the federal Health and Human Services Administration.Read more at Women's eNewsUnfortunately, observers and so-called experts say the numbers are not that high. They aren't at "epidemic" portions. And if you compare the U.S. to Niger, then yes, the American women don't seem to be at a high risk. But the numbers are increasing and few in the news media are flagging the fact the something is off.Continuing StoryAnd the story doesn't end there. The usual suspects--poverty, pre-existing conditions, obesity, teen pregnancy and lack of prenatal care--are most likely NOT completely responsible for the number of women who leave hospitals in coffins rather than walking out with their newborns in their arms.As the Women's eNews series documents, in New York City African American mothers die eight times as often as white women from pregnancy-related causes. A rare detailed study produced by the New York City and New York State health departments, through chart reviews, was able to itemize the causes of the deaths.President of the New York Academy of Medicine, Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford, stated in a Women's eNews video reviewing this study that nearly half of New York City maternal deaths are avoidable. A similar study, this one focused on California maternal deaths, indicated that African American women are up to four times more likely to die during pregnancy, child birth and shortly thereafter.However, California has not produced a report as granular as the New York study and, as of this writing, Women's eNews has not found any report on the federal or state level that is as detailed.Stand Out StatisticWomen's eNews' research, confirmed by Boufford and other specialists, found that the maternal deaths in New York City were not correlated with poverty, education, obesity, lack of prenatal care or pre-existing conditions. One statistic in the study does stand out though: Of those mothers who died of embolisms, 82 percent were African American, 0 percent were white. Disturbing racial disparities also occurred in the other major causes of maternal death: hemorrhage, infection and pregnancy-induced hypertension. Embolisms are widely considered preventable.The California report indicated that embolism was the most common cause of African American deaths as well and accounted for much of the disparity in that state's birth outcomes.More disturbing still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped publishing U.S. maternal mortality statistics after 2007. This is because 11 states have yet to adopt a standard form for reporting maternal deaths and nine more use a similar, but not the same, form with different questions.This decision to end the regular publication of maternal mortality data in the United States is a stunning example of why Women's eNews will continue to cover this story until the United States can provide pregnant women, including women of color, the medical care and social environment that maximizes the chances that each new mother will live long enough to parent her child.Find out more about how the new health care law may impact the future of pregnant women in Monday's Women's eNews story, "U.S. Health Law May Curb Rising Maternal Deaths."Read more at Women's eNews

Doron Lamb came off the bench to contribute 16.Monta Ellis scored 21 for the Bucks, who are headed for an eight-place finish in the Eastern Conference and a first-round playoff meeting with Miami.

LONDON, April 23 (UPI) -- The British Ministry of Defense has apologized to taxpayers for allowing Prince William to make training flights to a stag party and his girlfriend's house.The stag party for the prince's cousin was held on the Isle of Wight immediately after William received his pilot's wings, The Daily Mail reported. William also did flyovers of three royal houses in military Chinook helicopters and flew to a wedding.The Royal Air Force has backed off its earlier claim that these flights were all legitimate parts of William's training. "It was clear on occasions that those involved failed to appreciate how the media and public would perceive these flights and in retrospect there was a degree of naivety in the planning of these sorties," a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense said.But the spokesman also said the prince's training period with the RAF had been valuable for everyone, giving him "valuable insight into the roles and capabilities of a modern Air Force." If William becomes king, he will be the nominal commander-in-chief of the British military.

| License Photo	TAMPA, Fla., Aug. 24 (UPI) -- Former presidential candidate Ron Paul will be honored at the Republican National Convention with a short tribute film, a campaign strategist said Friday.The presentation on the second night of the convention will feature the libertarian-leaning Paul's colleagues giving "testimony to his principles and dedication to America," said strategist Russ Schriefer.As Mitt Romney prepares to accept the Republican nomination at the convention in Tampa, Fla., next week, there have been concerns the several hundred delegates committed to Paul will complicate the process and offer a picture of a political party not completely unified, CBS News said Friday.CBS said the Paul film will attempt to illustrate Romney's partnership with Paul and his supporters.

JARRETSVILLE, Md., Feb. 4 (UPI) -- A girl, 10, was impaled in the back by a steel reinforcement bar while sledding after a snowfall in Jarretsville, Md., a county fire official said.The unidentified child was hospitalized at a regional pediatric shock trauma unit about noon Monday, Hartford County Fire and EMS spokesman Rich Gardiner said.She was found near her home "lying on her side on a little slope with a pierce of rebar sticking out of her," Jarretsville Fire Company Chief Rudy Walter said, a reference to the term used for steel rods inserted in concrete to reinforce it.A reciprocating saw was used to cut the material away from the girl, "leaving a piece of about 6 inches hanging out of her," Walter added.She underwent surgery to remove the metal, and is expected to recover, the Baltimore Sun reported Tuesday."We do get sledding accidents, but [usually] what happens is the child or an adult ran into a tree ... a building or they ran into another person. We get nothing that they are impaled," Walter said.

BRAK, Libya, Nov. 29 (UPI) -- More than 30 people trying to steal ammunition from a west-central Libya military-airfield weapons depot were killed in an explosion, security officials said.It was not immediately clear what caused the ammunition supply-point blast at the Brak al-Shati air base near the city of Sabha, some 400 miles southeast of Tripoli, the Libya Herald reported.The blast was followed by a fire.The facility stored live ammunition and explosives. Such material can catch fire or degrade and become shock-sensitive over time."An unknown group tried to infringe on the warehouse causing this unfortunate incident," district Brigadier Mohamed al-Dahabyi told China's official Xinhua News Agency.The air base's ammunition compound has been hit by a recent rash of raid-like arms and ammunition thefts, the Herald said.Five days before Thursday's hit, "dozens of gunmen stormed the air base and looted all the ammunition inside the storage, including ammunition for heavy weapons such as rockets and artillery," base commander Col. Ahmed al-Hasnawi told the newspaper.Libya TV blamed the raid on civilians wanting the ammunition for its valuable copper.The privately owned Libyan al-Tadamun news agency said more than 30 people were killed in the blast.

Warren Commission report on JFK shooting now online
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 (UPI) -- The 900-page report by the Warren Commission on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy has been posted online, the Government Printing Office says.
U.S. News
The Issue: The Kennedy assassination -- did the mob do it?
It's been nearly 50 years since bullets were fired at the presidential motorcade as it wended its way through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, killing U.S. President John F. Kennedy and spawning decades of speculation on whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone or was part of -- or victim of -- a conspiracy with tentacles in Havana, Washington and perhaps Moscow.

Future of 'stop-and-frisk' may be dim
WASHINGTON, Aug. 18 (UPI) -- The fate of New York City's "stop and frisk" police program might be something of a morality play for the rest of the United States. How much freedom are U.S. citizens willing to give up in the name of security?

Under the U.S.Supreme Court: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev entitled to a lawyer?
WASHINGTON, April 28 (UPI) -- The FBI and the rest of a crack U.S. interrogation team wanted to question the remaining marathon bombing suspect in his Boston hospital room without his lawyer because of what they fear: undiscovered explosive devices that could still kill and possible accomplices who might decide to carry out more terror.

Wiki
Richard Alexander Ankiel (pronounced /ˈæŋkiːl/; born July 19, 1979) is a Major League Baseball outfielder who is currently with the Washington Nationals. He bats and throws left-handed.
Ankiel was a pitcher with the St. Louis Cardinals from 1999 until 2001, when he lost his ability to throw strikes consistently. After trying to regain his pitching form in the minor leagues, he switched to the outfield in early 2005. For two and a half years, he honed his skills as a hitter and fielder in the Cardinals' minor-league system. He was called up to the Cardinals on August 9, 2007, and made his second major-league "debut"—this time as an outfielder in right field—against the San Diego Padres in St. Louis. As a Cardinal (1999–2009), Ankiel hit 47 home runs as an outfielder and two as a pitcher. After a 2009 season in which he hit .231 with 11 home runs in 122 games, Ankiel became a free agent. Subsequently, he was signed by the Royals and later was traded to the Atlanta Braves. He is the first player since Babe Ruth to have won at least 10 games as a pitcher and also hit at least 50 home runs. Ankiel is also the only player other than Babe Ruth to both start a postseason game as a pitcher and hit a home run in the postseason as a position player.
Rick attended Port St. Lucie High School in Florida, where he went 11–1 with a 0.47 ERA during his senior season, striking out 162 batters in 74.0 innings pitched, and was named the High School Player of the Year by USA Today in 1997. He was also a first-team high-school All-American pitcher.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
