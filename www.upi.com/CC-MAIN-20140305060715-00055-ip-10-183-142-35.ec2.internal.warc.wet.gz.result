WASHINGTON, Nov. 7 (UPI) -- Median home prices for existing single-family homes rose in a vast majority of U.S. cities in the third quarter, the National Association of Realtors said.The median price -- the price midway between the highest and lowest prices -- rose in 120 of 149 metropolitan areas, the NAR said Wednesday."Housing inventories have been gradually trending down from a record set in the summer of 2007," NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said."Earlier this year, broad equilibrium began to develop in most areas between home buyers and sellers, which led to a sustained upturn in home prices.'The national median price in the third quarter for an existing single-family home was $186,100, up 7.6 percent from the third quarter of 2011, when the median price was $173,000, NAR said.Total sales of existing homes rose 3.2 percent to an annual seasonally adjusted rate of 4.68 million, up from 4.54 million in the second quarter and 10.3 percent higher than the third quarter of 2011.

CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 16 (UPI) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is pursuing plans to develop a home-grown defense industry topped by a drone built reportedly with Chinese, Iranian and Russian help.Drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles and associated systems have won over Venezuela's military procurers who see the UAVs as a conveniently cheaper supplement -- if not yet an alternative -- to expensive combat aircraft.Chavez has been hinting at a drone development program since early this year even as he was preoccupied with treatment to cure him of an unspecified cancer and his bid toward re-election.Earlier in October Chavez won 54 percent of the national vote, calling it a "perfect victory."Since defeating opposition leader Henrique Capriles, Chavez has redoubled efforts to inject new life into a fledgling defense industry. The drone project is part of that effort.Chavez announced after a meeting with military and defense officials that Venezuela has made its first drone in partnership with China, Iran and Russia and hopes to start exporting quantities of the craft. "It is one of the three planes that we have manufactured here, and we are continuing to make them ... not just for military use, (as) much of its equipment is for civilian use," Chavez said.The drones were developed in cooperation with "Russia, China, Iran and other allied countries," Chavez said during the address broadcast on radio and television.Chavez has yet to outline the kind of assistance received from China, Iran or Russia but has said said the drone developed locally is intended as a surveillance tool and will not be armed.Technical details of the drone are still sketchy but Gen. Julio Morales, president of the state-run Venezuelan Military Industrial Co., said the drone is about 13 feet long and 10 feet wide and equipped to take photographs and video. The craft has a 60-mile sweep and can fly for about 90 minutes and reach an altitude of 9,000 feet, Morales said.U.S. officials remain skeptical about the Venezuelan drone project and cite examples of previous statements by Chavez that made exaggerated claims about Venezuela's military achievements.Published media reports said the drone was assembled from parts made locally in Venezuela and built by engineers trained in Iran. Details of Venezuelans undergoing training in Iran remain vague, but the two countries have discussed wide ranging technical cooperation since an exchange of visits in 2010.Chavez said Venezuela also aimed to develop its own assault rifle, modelled after the Russian AK103, which offers versatile uses and can be adapted to operate with laser and conventional sights and be used as a grenade launcher.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 26 (UPI) -- A British Columbia woman said she wants the Vancouver Maritime Museum to deep six a display of whale bones with sexually explicit 19th century engravings.Ann Pimentel, a mother and school teacher, said her 2- and 3-year-old children were needlessly exposed to the "whale bone porn" without any warnings that the scrimshaw -- etchings on hard surfaces from the bodies of sea creatures -- would include sexually explicit images, the National Post reported Tuesday.Museum curator Patricia Owen said the pieces, part of the "Tattoo and Scrimshaw: The Art of the Sailor" exhibit, went on display last week and will remain until mid-October.The museum said Pimentel is the only person to have complained about the display, which is raised high off the ground, far above toddler height, and placed under a sign reading, "Hide Your Eyes! These pieces of scrimshaw are not intended for children."

EAST LANSING, Mich., March 25 (UPI) -- U.S. scientists have announced the first-ever discovery of a two-headed bull shark, confirming it was a single shark with two heads, not conjoined twins.Michigan State University researchers studying the specimen found in the uterus of an adult bull shark taken in the Gulf of Mexico April 7, 2011, said it was the first record of the phenomenon known as dicephalia ever seen in bull sharks although it has been seen before in other species of shark."This is certainly one of those interesting and rarely detected phenomena," MSU fisheries and wildlife Professor Michael Wagner said. "It's good that we have this documented as part of the world's natural history, but we'd certainly have to find many more before we could draw any conclusions about what caused this."A fisherman found the two-headed specimen when he cut open the adult shark, Wagner said, and it died shortly thereafter.It would have had little, if any, chance to survive in the wild, he said."You'll see many more cases of two-headed lizards and snakes," Wagner said in a university release Monday. "That's because those organisms are often bred in captivity, and the breeders are more likely to observe the anomalies."An MRI scan revealed two distinct heads, hearts and stomachs with the remainder of the body joining together in the back half of the animal to form a single tail, the researchers said.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 (UPI) -- A U.S. Iraqi police-training program has no performance measures and risks becoming a "bottomless pit," wasting U.S. taxpayer money, a watchdog group said.The State Department program to maintain peace when U.S. troops leave Iraq at the end of the year doesn't have Iraqi government support, the U.S. Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction said Monday.And only about 12 percent of the $887 million projected to be spent from this month through December will be spent on actually helping Iraq's police, the SIGIR report said. The "vast preponderance" will be spent on the security, transportation and medical support of the program's 115 police advisers, SIGIR said."Without specific goals, objectives and performance measures, the [Police Development Program] could become a 'bottomless pit' for U.S. dollars intended for mentoring, advising and training the Iraqi police forces," the report said.The program's price tag has also risen, with the cost of each trainer rising to $6.2 million a year, it said.Iraqi Deputy Interior Minister Adnan al-Assadi told SIGIR he thought Iraq saw little or no benefit from the program, which adds to the $8 billion the U.S. Defense Department has spent since 2003 to train, staff and equip Iraqi police forces before passing on the responsibilities to the State Department this month."I don't need it. I won't ask for it," Assadi was quoted in the report as saying."What tangible benefit will Iraqis see from this police training program?" the minister asked, suggesting Washington "take the program money and the overhead money and use it for something that can benefit the people of the United States, because there will be very little benefit" to Iraq's interior ministry, responsible for policing, national security and immigration matters.William Brownfield, U.S. assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, said the department "generally agrees" with the report's recommendations, but defended the program.The State Department -- which SIGIR said did not fully cooperate with the report -- will seek to cut costs in coming years and hire more Iraqi support employees, Brownfield said.The department has also been impeded by Iraq not having a permanent interior ministry and by delays from an independent organization that was supposed to do a detailed assessment of Iraqi police capabilities.That report will be completed next month, he said.

SEATTLE, April 2 (UPI) -- A Seattle-area man who allegedly beat a Sikh taxi driver has been charged with a federal hate crime, U.S. prosecutors said Tuesday. Jamie Larson, 49, of Federal Way was scheduled to appear before a federal magistrate Tuesday afternoon, SeattlePI.com reported. A U.S. grand jury handed up an indictment last week. Larson, who was originally charged in state court, was arrested at the scene of the attack on Oct. 17, 2012. Witnesses said he made a remark about the victim's turban and then, apparently believing him to be a Muslim, savagely assaulted him. Police said hairs in the victim's beard were ripped from his skin and one of his teeth loosened. Jennie Durkan, U.S. attorney for Western Washington, said Larson could be sentenced to as much as 10 years in prison if he is convicted. "Attacks such as this one, based on prejudice and racial hate, are contrary to who we are and violate the law," Durkan said in a statement. "Protecting the civil rights of all the members of our community is a top priority for our office."

MOSCOW, April 9 (UPI) -- A Russian lawmaker is banned from speaking at the next nine sessions of Parliament for making disparaging remarks while on a trip to the United States.Dmitry Gudkov, a member of the A Just Russia party, is forbidden to speak for nine sessions of the Russian Duma, the lower house of Parliament. He had traveled to the United States to address the ongoing tensions over adoptions of Russian children.While in the United States, Itar-Tass said Gudkov participated in a public event where he called the Duma "an obedient Parliament" that has passed unconstitutional laws at the behest of President Vladimir Putin.Gudkov denied any of the remarks were anti-Russian and implored fellow lawmakers not to pass a ban on U.S. adoptions.Gudkov said his trip found very few instances of Russian children abused by their adoptive U.S. parents -- and noted Russian adoption rates have plummeted, making for more and more children growing up orphans."Aren't you interested in my trip to the U.S.A.?" he asked in a speech before he was censured. "They tell us there is no access to Russian children in U.S. families -- it is absolutely not so! Americans have adopted 60,000 Russian children in two decades, and there have been just 20 tragic cases. Over the same period, adoption by Russians has decreased by 30 percent."The Duma went ahead with the ban, which Putin supports.

Aug. 23 (UPI) -- Beginning November 1, birth certificates in Germany will have three gender options: female, male and "blank."Babies born with characteristics that are neither exclusively male nor exclusively female have long been subject to sex assignment surgery as infants. In many cases, the biological sex chosen by the surgeon does not match the gender identity of the patient once awareness or adolescence is reached.The law allows such infants to choose for themselves later in life whether to identify as male or female and consent to medical treatments appropriate to their choice.The law also allows those assigned a third gender at birth to remain outside the gender binary if they choose, though passports and other documents still require a male or female designation.Earlier this year, Australia became the first country in the world to introduce legal guidelines for gender recognition.There, individuals have "the option to select M (male), F (female) or X (Indeterminate/Intersex/Unspecified)" on all personal documents. Individuals may opt into the third gender category regardless of whether they have undergone surgery or hormone therapy.The Australian legislation also protects "intersex status" alongside other protected statuses including sex and race.Human rights organizations continue to make headway on the issue in Europe, as other countries including Finland attempt to adopt new gender guidelines.The Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics apologized last year for past treatment of intersex individuals, calling for "an end to surgery for psychosocial reasons."The group also halted non-trivial treatment until a child can consent, and the policy is enforced with criminal sanctions.

Brett M. Gardner (born August 24, 1983, Holly Hill, South Carolina) is an American Major League Baseball left fielder for the New York Yankees. Gardner, who is 5' 10", bats and throws left-handed.
In 2001, Gardner attended walk-on tryouts for the baseball team at the College of Charleston. After the tryouts, Coach John Pawlowski told the players that he would contact them if they made the team. Without hearing a word from the coach, Gardner came to the field the next day for the first official practice, wearing his high school uniform. When Pawlowski asked Gardner why he was there, Gardner told him that he knew he was capable of playing at the Division I level. Pawlowski told Gardner that he could practice with the team, but if at any time if Pawlowski saw that Gardner wasn't capable then he would be let go.
Gardner was a three-year starter at the College of Charleston. In 2004, he was chosen to the All-Southern Conference Team. His .447 batting average was third in the nation in 2005, and his 122 hits tied for most in the country. His 85 runs in 2005 is the all-time record at College of Charleston, and his 38 stolen bases led the Southern Conference. He wrapped up his Cougar career as a third-team All-American and a second-time All-Southern Conference player, sporting a .382/.456/.508 career line, mostly from the lead-off spot.
