| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Sept. 3 (UPI) -- The U.S. unemployment rate increased to 9.6 percent and the economy lost 54,000 jobs in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.The figures were in line with economists' expectations but the job-loss figure marked the third consecutive month the economy shed jobs. The United States lost a total of 229,000 jobs in June and July, when the unemployment rate was 9.5 percent, after adjustments of previously announced data.The federal government, still losing census-related jobs, shed 121,000 jobs but the private sector gained 67,000 positions in August. That last figure is seen as a positive.The bureau said the number of unemployed people was about unchanged at 14.9 million. The number of people who have been without work for more than 26 weeks fell by 323,000 to 6.2 million. However, the number of "discouraged workers" -- those who have stopped looking for work because they don't believe there are jobs available -- totaled 1.1 million, a 352,000 increase over a year ago.The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the healthcare sector gained 28,000 jobs in August, a gain nearly offset by a drop of 27,000 manufacturing positions. Construction employment was up 19,000 during the month.Data indicate federal government employment dropped by 121,000, with 114,000 of those being temporary positions for the 2010 U.S. Census.

ATLANTA, May 25 (UPI) -- Fewer than 25 percent of U.S. communities have parks or recreation centers within one-half mile of their boundaries, making fitness difficult, officials say. The report, State Indicator Report on Physical Activity 2010, released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, includes data about physical activity and barriers to physical activity. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, says the report finds 17 percent of the nation's high school students say they get the minimally recommended 1 hour of physical activity daily. "Regular physical activity is essential to overall health and can also help people maintain a healthy weight and reduce their risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases," Frieden says in a statement. "This state indicator report provides a measure for a state's ability to support physical activity and shows where a state has been successful and where more work may be needed."The sedentary lifestyles of U.S. adolescents may be partially because 50 percent of youth reported having access to parks, playgrounds, community centers and sidewalks that make physical activity convenient. Twenty states require or recommend scheduled recess for elementary students, while 37 states mandate elementary, middle and high schools to teach physical education, the report says. The report is at: www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/professionals/reports/index.html.

DENVER, June 29 (UPI) -- A 12-year-old Colorado boy had an encounter with a moth that was a little too close, he said, as the insect crawled into his ear as he slept.Wade Schlote, who lives in the Parker area, said he's used to seeing bugs but not quite at such close range, KUSA-TV, Denver, reported Tuesday."I had a moment of panicking. I was in pain. It was hurting so much I was screaming and crying," he said.When Wade and his mother Kathy were unable to wash the moth out of the boy's ear at home, they headed for the emergency room."[The doctors] said, 'Yeah, right. There's no moth in there.' But when they looked, sure enough, there was a moth," Kathy Schlote said."The doctors tried numbing my ear, thinking it would help with the pain and kill the moth," Wade said. "That didn't work. Then they tried drowning it. That didn't work. Then they tried irrigating it. That didn't work. Finally, the doctor pulled it out with tweezers and when they did it was still alive and started flying around."Experts say the best strategy for an insect invading your ear is to remain calm and go straight to the emergency room to have it removed. Trying to remove it yourself risks puncturing the ear drum, they say.

PARIS, Jan. 13 (UPI) -- European Space Agency researchers say they're working on a high-tech, tight-fitting "skinsuit" to help astronauts overcome back problems in space.Astronauts have been known to get taller by as much as 2.7 inches as their spines lengthen in weightlessness, with many astronauts suffering from backache during their missions as a result, the ESA says.After a mission an astronaut has four times more chance of suffering a slipped disc than usual, the researchers said.That led them to work on developing the "skinsuit," a tailor-made overall with a bi-directional weave specially designed to counteract the lack of gravity by squeezing the body from the shoulders to the feet with a similar force to that felt on Earth from gravity."Getting the suit to fit correctly was challenging," Simon Evetts of the Medical Projects and Technology Unit team at the European Astronaut Center said. "We needed to create a suit that is both tight-fitting but comfortable to wear, while creating the right amount of force in the right places."ESA's Space Medicine Office is working with the Kings College in London and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to test prototypes, and ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen will be the first to wear the suit in space during a mission in 2015, the agency said.

CLEMSON, S.C., Feb. 17 (UPI) -- Kenny Kadji hit a go-ahead 3-pointer in the final minute Sunday and No. 3 Miami-Florida edged Clemson 45-43 to stay unbeaten in Atlantic Coast Conference play.Kadji's shot with 34.7 seconds left came after he had misfired on his first five attempts from 3-point range. The Hurricanes (21-3, 12-0 ACC) managed to connect on only 3-of-19 long-distance tries as a team.They held on for the win when Clemson's Rod Hall missed a lay-in and K.J. McDaniel couldn't put in a tip attempt at the buzzer.Jordan Roper led the Tigers (13-12, 5-8 ACC) with 19 points. Devin Booker had 11 points and 10 rebounds.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Republican U.S. senators told Richard Cordray Tuesday his appointment by President Obama as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was invalid.At Cordray's first Senate hearing as CFPB head, GOP lawmakers said agency rules will face court challenges, causing uncertainty about which rules businesses need to follow, the Los Angeles Times reported."I can't imagine how anybody could maintain under the circumstances that your appointment and your service is valid," said Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb. "And I can't imagine then … how the actions you are taking will be upheld, and I think that's a very, very serious consequence for our nation."Republicans had blocked confirmation votes on any nominee to head the agency, whose powers the GOP lawmakers want restricted, and had prevented the Senate from formally taking a recess for more than three days, in an effort to head off a recess appointment.Republicans asserted Obama's appointment of Cordray was unconstitutional because it came when the Senate technically was still in session. But the president, with backing from the Justice Department, said the Senate's pro forma sessions were meant to stop him from making recess appointments.Senate Republicans had blocked a vote on Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general, in December.Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said there is "no question there's going to be constitutional challenges" to Cordray's appointment."I have been appointed as director," Cordray said. "There may be issues about that … but I now have legal obligations I'm supposed to carry out for this bureau. I'm going to do that."

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, June 24 (UPI) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-1 Monday to narrow the use of affirmative action by state schools, but fell short of striking down such policies altogether.Justice Elena Kagan, who was U.S. solicitor general when the Texas dispute was in the lower courts, took no part in the case. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion.More than three-fourths of freshmen enroll at the University of Texas at Austin under a state law that gives automatic admission to students in the top 10 percent of their high school classes. For the rest, the school considers a number of factors, including race.Two white students denied UT admission under the policy challenged it in federal court. A three-judge appellate panel upheld the admissions policy, and the full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most conservative in the country, refused to rehear the case by a vote of 9-7. The majority said UT's admissions program was "narrowly tailored," as required by the 2003 Supreme Court precedent in Grutter vs. Bollinger, which approved affirmative action at the University of Michigan Law School.But the Supreme Court threw out the appeals court ruling in the Texas case, saying it didn't adhere to Grutter. Kennedy said, "The reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity."Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the sole dissenter."The court rightly declines to cast off the equal protection framework settled in Grutter," she said. "Yet itstops short of reaching the conclusion that framework warrants. Instead, the [Supreme] Court vacates the Court of Appeals' judgment and remands [sends it back] ... to 'assess whether the university has offered sufficient evidence [to] prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.'"As I see it," Ginsburg added, "the court of appeals has already completed that inquiry, and its judgment trained on this court's [precedents] merits our approbation."

| License Photo	MOSCOW, Dec. 27 (UPI) -- A Russian delegation is scheduled to meet with a Russian man who has been held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for more than a decade, an official said.The delegation is set to meet Ravil Mingazov, a former Russian solider, Jan. 17, Russia's human rights commissioner Konstantin Dolgov said.Russian officials have been trying to meet with Mingazov for years, but conditions for the visit to the U.S. military detention facility had not been agreed upon by the United States, RIA Novosti reported Friday."We will use this visit and put the question bluntly so that this special facility will be closed as soon as possible," Dolgov said.Mingazov was first incarcerated in October 2002, but has never been charged with a crime. The prison, which was established in 2002, has long come under fire for holding prisoners without charging them with crimes, RIA Novosti said.Mingazov was accused of being a member of the al-Qaida-affiliated Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. He allegedly received explosives training in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan.

Wiki
Alan Eugene Jackson (born October 17, 1958) is an American country music singer, known for blending honky tonk and mainstream country sounds and penning many of his own hits. He has recorded 14 studio albums and several compilations, all on the Arista Nashville label. More than 50 of his singles have appeared on Billboard's list of the "Top 30 Country Songs". Of Jackson's entries, 26 were number-one hits. He is the recipient and nominee of multiple awards. Jackson is also a member of the Grand Ole Opry, and he was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2001.
Jackson was born to Joseph Eugene Jackson and Ruth Musick in Newnan, Georgia and has four older siblings. Jackson is of English descent. As a youth, Jackson listened primarily to gospel music. Otherwise he was not a major music fan. However, a friend of his introduced him to the music of Gene Watson, John Anderson and Hank Williams Jr. Jackson attended the local Elm Street Elementary and Newnan High School, starting a band after high school. After a time, he and his wife of six years, Denise Jackson, moved from Newnan to Nashville where Jackson hoped to pursue music full-time.
Jackson sang in church as a child. He, his father, mother, and four sisters lived in a small home. At one point, his bed was in the hallway for lack of room. His mother lives in the home to this day. His first job, at 12, was in a shoe store. He wrote his first song in 1983. He worked as a car salesman in his 20s.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG

Matan Vilnai (Hebrew: מתן וילנאי‎, born 20 May 1944) is an Israeli politician and a former Major General in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). He is currently Minister for Home Front Defense and a member of the Knesset for Independence.
Vilnai was born in Jerusalem in 1944. His father was Prof. Zev Vilnay, a pioneer in the sphere of Israeli geography and Land of Israel studies, from whom he inherited a love of nature and hiking. He was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces in 1966, serving in the Paratroopers Brigade and the elite reconnaissance unit Sayeret Matkal. He was deputy commander of the assault force in Operation Thunderbolt, also known as the Entebbe Raid, to free Jewish and Israeli passengers taken hostage by Palestinian and German terrorists after their Air France plane was hijacked to Entebbe, Uganda. Vilanai led the assault team into the airport building, while another team secured the outside. As a major general, Vilnai was the head of the Manpower Directorate, as well as the Deputy Chief of Staff.
Today Vilnai lives in Mevasseret Zion and is a married father of three.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
