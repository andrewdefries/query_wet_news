MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay, Dec. 15 (UPI) -- Latin America's Mercosur trade bloc is planning to fast-track Venezuela's long-delayed accession as a full member as regional leaders push plans to strengthen and expand the organization.Mercosur is in talks with the European Union on a trade agreement that both sides increasingly see as a window of opportunity for increased trade and new revenue streams.The EU has been searching for ways to stimulate its economic performance as it battles to contain the contagion of crisis over its members' debt-ridden economies.Mercosur offers a huge potential market for Europe, covering about 5 million square miles of territory, a population of more than 267 million and a combined gross domestic product of $2.9 trillion.The trade pact's members, increasingly skeptical about immediate business prospects in recession-hit Europe, see an entry into EU's free trade regime as a long-term investment.Venezuela's accession as a full member is also crucial to Mercosur's regional trade expanding to the benefit of full members Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay and associate members Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.Uruguayan President Jose Mujica, the current president of Mercosur, said he would propose amendments to membership rules when Mercosur's council meets Tuesday in Montevideo. Venezuela's accession as a full member has been snagged by delays in ratification by Paraguay's Parliament, the only remaining stumbling block under current rules.The rules require assent from each of the member countries' parliaments before full membership can be confirmed."We talked about the review of legal criteria in such a way that on Dec. 20, when the Mercosur summit convenes in Montevideo, it can open the way for Venezuela's full membership, something on which both Argentina and Brazil and Uruguay are in accord," Mujica said."The only thing I spoke about with the Argentine president is that Mercosur legislation, as currently drafted, does not allow Venezuela's incorporation unless the Paraguayan Senate approves it, even when the Paraguayan government supports Venezuela's full membership," he added.Mujica said Mercosur leaders discussed the possibility of changing the rules to facilitate Venezuela's admission, the last time last week when they assembled in Buenos for the inauguration of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner in her second term in office. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, even though he's being treated for cancer, also attended the ceremonies.Venezuela's membership of Mercosur has been mired in controversy over criticism of radical policies pursued by Chavez. The Brazilian lawmakers' opposition to Venezuela's membership was overruled by former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and his supporters. However, in Paraguay, President Fernando Lugo's government has been unable to secure a convincing majority to push through a pro-Venezuela ratification vote in that country's congress.Mujica's comments triggered new speculation about the current level of "consensus" on Venezuela's membership. He said in published comments that Lugo might still need a little talking to for the membership issue to be resolved.The legislatures in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay approved Venezuela's accession as a full member after it signed a membership agreement in 2006 but Lugo's opponents in Paraguay's congress continue to hold back ratification, partly to embarrass the president and partly because of opposition to Chavez.The Mercosur presidential summit will open in Montevideo next Tuesday when the six-month rotating chair will pass from Uruguay to Argentina.Under current rules any modification to a 1991 treaty of Asuncion, Paraguay, that governs Mercosur requires consensus from the presidents of the four founding members.

| License Photo	LOS ANGELES, Jan. 14 (UPI) -- Zack Snyder's publicist says the Hollywood filmmaker is not developing a new "Star Wars" movie, contrary to online rumors."While he is super flattered because he is a huge fan, Zack is not involved in any way with 'Star Wars.' He is currently in post [production] on his two films, 'Man of Steel' and '300: Battle of Artemisia,'" Snyder's representative said in a statement Monday.The comment was made in response to reports claiming Snyder is developing a standalone "Star Wars" movie inspired by the 1954 classic "Seven Samurai," EW.com reported Monday."Little Miss Sunshine" and "Toy Story 3" scribe Michael Arndt is writing the screenplay for the recently announced "Star Wars: Episode VII," however, no director or cast has been announced yet.

EDMONTON, Alberta, June 10 (UPI) -- A program in Canadian elementary schools designed to rid schools of bullying behavior directed at students who stutter is effective, researchers say. Marilyn Langevin, acting executive director and director of research at the Institute for Stuttering Treatment and Research at the University of Alberta and creator of the Teasing and Bullying Unacceptable Behavior program, said it is taught province-wide to students in grades 3 to 6 to reduce teasing and bullying directed at children with differences. In this study, Langevin and her team surveyed more than 600 students who participated in the program to evaluate its effectiveness at changing attitudes about stuttering.Children who know someone who stutters -- a family member, friend or peer -- generally have more positive attitudes toward them, Langevin said. However, it's a different story for those with little frame of reference with stuttering -- an unpredictable disorder characterized by repetitions or prolonged sounds -- can be accompanied by head jerks, nods and facial grimaces that take some people by surprise, she said."It's the children who don't know someone who stutters that generally have more negative attitudes toward kids who stutter," Langevin said in a statement. "We're very pleased to see this group had the highest change scores since they're the group we wanted to target."The study is scheduled to be published in the July issue of Language, Speech and Hearing Services in Schools.

| License Photo	(UPI) -- Bob Barker spent almost $1 million to transport three elephants form Canada to the Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) in California.The former Price is Right host, an avid animal rights advocate, funded the road trip for Iringa, Thika and Toka, African elephants that had been living at the Toronto Zoo in Ontario, Canada.The Toronto City Council voted to have the elephants transported to a sanctuary after intense lobbying by Barker and other advocates who claimed most zoos provide too small a living space for such large animals.The three pachyderms will join eight other elephants, including three Africans, on the 2,000 acres of land PAWS has in Calaveras County.The ARK 2000 compound is the largest captive wildlife sanctuary in the United States. The park houses elephants, tigers and other large animals who have been relocated from zoos or retired from the circus industry. The compound operates as part of PAWS, founded in 1984 by the late Pat Derby and her life partner, Ed Stewart.Stewart, considered one of the world's leading specialists in housing and care of captive elephants, said he'll work with staffers and veterinarians to introduce the new elephants to the rest of the animals."[The process] may take weeks, months or even longer," he said. "Our job will be to give each elephant the best care and their own time and space in which to adjust.”Barker, 89, waited for the creatures and witnessed them step out of their trailer into the ARK 2000 compound.“It was more than emotional for me, for all of us,” Barker said. “I had tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat. It’s hard to believe they are finally here.”

DAMASCUS, Syria, June 21 (UPI) -- Rebels battling government forces in the Syrian civil war have new weapons capable of changing the dynamic of the conflict, a rebel commander said.Salim Idriss, military commander of the Free Syrian Army, told al-Arabiya opposition forces had new weapons on hand to fight government troops. The new weapons "will change the course of the battle on the ground," he said in an interview published Friday.Al-Arabiya reports the rebel commander said in an earlier interview it would take about six months to bring down the regime of President Bashar Assad if opposition forces were well equipped and trained.The U.S. government last week said it believes more than 100 people in Syria were killed by chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin, launched by pro-government forces.President Obama has said the use of chemical weapons by Syrian government forces was a "red line" that would trigger U.S. reaction.The Sunday Times in London reported 300 U.S. Marines were deployed to Jordan to help with the transfer of military assistance to anti-government forces. The rebel leader did not indicate the origin of the new weapons.British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Monday the government was discussing a range of options in Syria with the U.S. and French governments. His government has not made a decision, however, on whether to send military assistance.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 (UPI) -- The United States is still providing Bahrain with weapons, despite the Middle Eastern country's abuse of pro-democracy protesters, documents indicate.Defense Department documents show the United States has sold ammunition, combat vehicle parts, communications equipment, helicopters and an unidentified missile system to Bahrain.The documents don't clarify whether the arms have been delivered or how much the materials are worth.ProPublica said U.S. officials have said they are selling the arms to the country only for external defense, but many are worried the weapons could be used against civilian protesters. ProPublica cited reports Bahrain used U.S.-made helicopters to fire on protesters. A U.S. team specialized in training foreign militaries was also in Bahrain to help with the use of Blackhawk helicopters, ProPublica reported. ProPublica said the Obama administration has stood by Bahrain's Sunni ruling family during the Shiite protests.

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 23 (UPI) -- An injured 10-week-old puppy was found by employees at a San Francisco recycling plant, officials said.The puppy, which apparently had been thrown out, was discovered Friday at the Recology recycling facility when an employee noticed something moving inside a black plastic bag on a conveyor belt, KGO-TV, San Francisco, reported."Maybe there was some other trash or some other material in it, and I can see the puppy was trying to crawl out the bag," Recology employee Greg Foster said.Foster said he stopped the line immediately and removed a 10-week-old poodle puppy from the bag. The dog was wet and bleeding."It had to be loaded by our forklift driver and also go through what we call the shaker, in which we try to shake the debris like the dirt and little Styrofoam and stuff like that and it came down the line eventually," Foster said.The puppy was given to San Francisco Animal Care and Control where workers have named her Gem."And that's what we're working with Recology trying to track, see if they can track which truck she came in on by reviewing their camera system or see if we know what neighborhood that she came from," city Animal Care and Control Capt. Le-Ellis Brown said.

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, July 9 (UPI) -- Russia's Constitutional Court has ruled that website owners must delete defamatory material if ordered to do so by a court.The ruling follows the introduction of a series of recent legislative measures by the Russian government to control Internet content, the Russian Legal Information Agency reported Tuesday."The owners of any site, including those not registered as media outlets, will now have to delete defamatory information posted on their sites by other users in accordance with a court decision," the Constitutional Court's press service said. "However, the site owners will not be financially liable for other users' comments.The ruling comes in a case filed by a Russian man named Yevgeny Krylov who said he was defamed on an Internet forum in October 2009 after an unidentified person posted his photograph with captions and opinions ti which anonymous users added insulting comments. A lower court in the district where Krylov lives ruled that the information posted on the forum was false and defamatory.
