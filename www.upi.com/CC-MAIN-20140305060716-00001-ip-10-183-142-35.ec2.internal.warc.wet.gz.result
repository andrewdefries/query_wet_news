| License Photo	NEW YORK, Aug. 18 (UPI) -- Members of the New York Mercantile Exchange voted handily Monday in favor of being bought out by CME Group Inc., the exchanges said in a joint statement.Only about 40 of the 816 Nymex members either abstained or voted against the takeover, The Wall Street Journal reported.CME Chairman Terry Duffy said Nymex was greeted with applause from shareholders when he announced the deal "received the required approval," the business newspaper said."In the end, Nymex really had no other place to go," said Lee Stern, a long-time CME shareholder at the meeting.Based on CME's closing share price of $336.64 -- a drop of 5.9 percent -- the deal was valued at $8.26 billion. Nymex finished down 2.6% at $79.95.The deal was a year in the making, with a group of Nymex members dissatisfied with the terms threatening to block it."Obviously, when it came down to it, this was a fear-based transaction," said Jan Marks, one of the dissident Nymex members. "A lot of people caved in to fear. Those who didn't are the lions, not the lambs."

PARIS, June 15 (UPI) -- Accelerated sales of electric automobiles would only make a small dent in alleviating worldwide oil dependency, the IEA said from Paris.Automobile and battery manufacturers are touting electric vehicles as components of the push to advance a clean-energy economy. U.S. President Barack Obama has set a goal of putting more than 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.The International Energy Agency said that if global targets for electric vehicles are met, there would be 20 million of those vehicles on the road by 2020. Despite the ambitious efforts, however, the IEA said that represents only 2 percent of the 1 billion cars expected on the roads that year.The IEA in a May report found that energy consumption in electric motor-driven systems makes up about 19 percent of the global electricity demand, eclipsing the electricity used in lighting.The latest IEA report on so-called myths tied to some clean-energy initiatives comes as British Gas announces an alliance with automobile manufacturer Renault. Thierry Sybord, managing director of Renault, said in a statement that an "electric revolution" is on the horizon for British consumers.Renault and British Gas said industry analysts predict 10 percent of the vehicles on British road will be electric vehicles in 2020.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 (UPI) -- The vice chairman of the Sept. 11 Commission told a Senate panel Monday that the commission's recommendations on border and transportation security "might lead to" a national identity card. Although the commission shied away from directly making the controversial call in its final report, "We did recommend national standards for drivers' licenses," Vice Chairman Lee Hamilton told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee."Over time," he told committee Chairman Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., "that might lead to a national ID card.""Isn't that a fundamental issue that we're going to have to address as a nation?" McCain asked Commission Chairman Tom Kean.Kean replied that the commission had judged biometric screening -- using techniques like fingerprinting or retinal scanning -- to be "a little less intrusive," but acknowledged "A national ID card would be another way to do it."The American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement Tuesday that federal standards for drivers' licenses constituted a "backdoor attempt to create a national ID-card system and a serious threat to privacy, liberty and safety."They said the idea "would provide a new tool for racial, religious or ethnic profiling and would lead to far more illegal discrimination."The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, which represents state DMVs, welcomed the proposal. "We concur with the commission's recommendation that the security of both the issuance process for the state-issued driver's license and the document itself need to be strengthened," said the group's president, Linda Lewis.But the emergence of the license as what the association calls the "identification document of choice throughout North America" has brought with it problems.A number of state governments have faced controversy since Sept. 11, 2001, about the so-called legal-presence requirement, a law that requires applicants for a license to prove their U.S. citizenship or their right to reside in the United States.Advocates say such rules are essential to maintain the integrity of the de facto national ID document, but immigrants' rights advocates counter that trying to exclude undocumented migrants turns "motor vehicles bureaus into immigration agents -- without additional funds or adequate training," in the words of the ACLU.Motor vehicle administrators also have reservations about the legal presence requirement. "Our initials are D-M-V, not I-N-S," said American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators spokesman Jason King -- referring to the acronym of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which was absorbed into the new Department of Homeland Security last year."We are the experts in driver licensing, not immigration."Tuesday, Hamilton said he thought McCain's call for a debate on the issue of a national ID was right on the mark. "The American public is becoming more and more agreeable to intrusiveness in order to protect themselves against terrorist attacks," he said, adding that the idea was nonetheless still controversial.But in its final report last month, the commission, formally known as the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, proposed changes to the nation's identity regime more radical than federal standards for drivers' licenses.The report recommended a seamless biometric border so that everyone entering or leaving the country, whatever their nationality, would have their identity biometrically confirmed.Currently, under the U.S.-VISIT program only one category of travelers -- those foreigners holding visas -- is subjected to such a check, and then only at airports.The Department for Homeland Security, which runs U.S.-VISIT, plans to extend the system to cover foreigners from the 27 visa-waiver nations who arrive without visas and to roll it out gradually at border crossings beginning later this year. But even when U.S.-VISIT is complete at the end of 2005, U.S. citizens will still be able to enter the country without a biometric identity check. The State Department recently announced that, by the end of that year, it will begin issuing U.S. passports with a single biometric identifier -- a digitized photograph that can be checked with facial-recognition software.At Monday's hearing, Sen. George Allen, R-Va., questioned the choice of facial recognition as the biometric, saying it had a failure rate as high as 50 percent.State Department officials point out that the digital photograph is the international standard for passport biometrics, agreed by the International Civil Aviation Organization. But advocates of biometric security for travel documents say that this was simply the path of least resistance -- people are used to submitting their photographs already."The harmonization with other countries is important," acknowledged Allen. "But is it so important to disregard the fingerprint-technology option, which I believe is superior to the State Department's current plan?"A State Department official pointed out that collecting photographs from passport applicants and digitizing them was easy, compared with having to install equipment to do fingerprint scans at the 6,000-plus facilities -- including post offices and court houses -- that currently accept passport applications."First time applicants, or those whose passports expired more than five years ago, have to apply in person," the official said. "Installing fingerprint stations at all those locations would be a serious logistical burden."Privacy advocates also point out that, since the passports and the data encoded on them will be machine readable, using fingerprints as a biometric would effectively be requiring U.S. citizens to hand a permanent digital record of their prints to the government of any foreign country they visited.The commission further advocated that the biometric border be fully integrated with an internal system of checkpoints, controlling access to the nation's critical infrastructure and transport system, as well as federal buildings."That could be a recipe for a system of internal controls that would treat people traveling within the United States in the same way it treats those crossing its borders," cautioned Greg Nojeim, associate director of the ACLU's Washington office.--(Please send comments to nationaldesk@upi.com.)

MADRID, Dec. 20 (UPI) -- People with high levels of the trace elements nickel and selenium may have a reduced risk of developing pancreatic cancer, U.S. and Spanish researchers say.Dr. Niria Malats of the Spanish National Cancer Research Center in Madrid, researchers at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., and colleagues also found high levels of lead, arsenic and cadmium could boost the likelihood of developing the disease.The researchers assessed 12 trace element levels in the toenails of 118 patients with exocrine pancreatic cancer -- the most common form of the disease -- and just under 400 hospital patients without cancer.The study, published in the journal Gut, found patients with the highest levels of arsenic and cadmium in their nails were between two and 3.5 times more likely than those with the lowest levels to have pancreatic cancer, and those with the highest levels of lead were more than six times as likely to have the disease.Those with the highest levels of nickel and selenium were between 33 percent and 95 percent less likely than those with the lowest levels to have the disease."Our results support an increased risk of pancreatic cancer associated with higher levels of cadmium, arsenic, and lead, as well as an inverse association with higher levels of selenium and nickel," the researchers said in a statement.

WASHINGTON, March 16 (UPI) -- The House Government Reform Committee on Wednesday denied immunity for those who will testify about steroids in baseball.That decision will almost certainly mean star witness Jose Canseco will not answer questions during hearings that are officially called, "evaluating Major League Baseball's efforts to eradicate steroid use." In a recently published book, Canseco accused various players of using steroids.Among those called to testify have been Sammy Sosa, Curt Schilling, Frank Thomas, Rafael Palmeiro and Mark McGwire.Commissioner Bud Selig has announced he will testify as well.Because he was not granted immunity, Canseco is expected to invoke his fifth amendment rights and refuse to answer questions."Those could expose him to criminal liability and we're just not going to risk that," said Robert Saunooke, Canseco's lawyer.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 (UPI) -- The National Transportation Safety Board said it is investigating the battery fire on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Boston's Logan International Airport.The fire aboard the Japan Airlines plane Dec. 7 caused speculation the new aircraft, made largely of composite components, has reliability problems. It was traced to a lithium-ion battery that powered the plane's auxiliary power unit. There were no injuries in the incident.The NTSB said in a statement the battery and its wiring, memory modules and charger were taken to the NTSB materials laboratory in Washington for investigation, as were the airplane's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.

| License Photo	DAMASCUS, Syria, Feb. 7 (UPI) -- Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and head of foreign intelligence Mikhail Fradkov arrived in Damascus Tuesday to meet with Syrian President Bashar Assad.Russia "firmly intends to seek the swiftest stabilization of the situation in Syria on the basis of the swiftest implementation of democratic reforms whose time has come," Lavrov said.Syria has been a key Middle Eastern client state of Moscow since 1971. The arrival of the Russian representatives comes three days after Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council measure condemning Assad's crackdown on protesters and calling for him to be replaced by a unity government.U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice called the vetoes "disgusting," saying Russia and China "will have any future blood spill on their hands." U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denounced them as a "travesty." Washington Monday closed its embassy in Damascus, saying the situation had deteriorated to the point where the safety of embassy staff could no longer be guaranteed."There are some in the West who have given evaluations of the vote on Syria in the United Nations Security Council that sound, I would say, indecent and perhaps on the verge of hysterical," Lavrov said. "Those who get angry are rarely right."He said Russia had been willing to come to a consensus with other council members but its proposed amendments were shot down Saturday and the resolution was put to a vote in a "hasty" way that all but invited Russia's veto to make Moscow look bad."We asked [supporters of the anti-Assad resolution] to wait a few days before putting it to a vote," so he and Fradkov could travel to Syria for the Assad meeting, Lavrov said. "But they thought it more important to transfer the blame for what is happening.Syrian forces killed at least 128 people nationwide Monday, mostly in Homs, the opposition Syrian Revolution General Commission said. On Tuesday, 21 people were killed in Homs, CNN reported. Mousa Azzawi of the Syrian Network for Human Rights told CNN, "the situation is very dire," saying Monday was "like a bloodbath."U.N. officials estimate about 6,000 people have died since the uprising began almost a year ago.

Jan. 9 (UPI) -- One of the stranger tidbits to emerge from James Holmes' preliminary hearings were details of the photos the shooter took of himself before he rained terror upon a theater full of moviegoers in an Aurora, Colo., cinema.On the final day of the pre-trial hearings Wednesday, the prosecution against Holmes showed "creepy" self-portraits the alleged shooter took in the hours before he walked into a showing of The Dark Knight Rises on July 20 and opened fire, killing 12 people and wounding 58 others.Prosecutor Karen Pearson told the courtroom the photos were shown to demonstrate Holmes' "depravity of human heart," Yahoo News reported. She said the photos displayed his extreme indifference and deliberation.He "wanted to kill all of them. He knew what he was doing," Pearson said. He "went into the theater without knowing or caring who they are."The half-dozen photos showed Holmes wearing a black cap over his bright orange hair, sometimes wearing black contact lenses on his eyes.One photo showed him sticking out his tongue at the camera, and in other, Holmes posed with a pistol in front of his face. Still another showed Holmes wearing the tactical gear he was wearing when police arrested him after the shooting, holding an AR-15 rifle.
