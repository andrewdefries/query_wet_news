LONDON, Feb. 28 (UPI) -- The British government announced it gave $30 million to support the development of technology used to exploit marine energy.London said companies MeyGen Ltd. and Sea Generation Wales Ltd. won the funding from the Marine Energy Array Demonstrator plan launched last year.The British government said marine energy could meet as much as 20 percent of nationwide energy demand by 2050."These projects will provide valuable insight into how best to harness the power of the sea and take us one vital step closer to realizing the full potential of marine in our future energy mix," British Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Barker said.MeyGen touted its project as the largest tidal energy development of its kind to get government support. Six tidal energy turbines would be installed as part of a demonstration array by 2014.Sea Generation said its nine devices would be able to generate 10 MW of energy through nine tidal turbines. Its array would be fully operational by 2015."This $30 million will give MeyGen and Sea Generation Wales the boost they need to leap to the next level and test their innovative turbines in formations out at sea," Barker said.

June 19 (UPI) -- About five-and-a-half minutes into his interview with MSNBC's "Morning Joe," Russell Brand had had enough of the anchors' flippant questioning and snide digs at his career and personality. "He’s a really big deal. I’m told this," Mika Brzezinski said as she introduced the 38-year-old comedian, who tried to keep his composure as the MSNBC hosts discussed him in the third person and casually asked him if he had a mental illness. "You're talking about me as if I'm not here, as if I'm an extra-terrestrial!" Brand finally said to the anchors, who began to look visibly nervous."You shouldn't say 'he' when a person is present. You should refer to the person by their name. That is basic good manners. Is this what you all do for a living?" he asked.Brand went on to chastise them for their less-than-professional behavior as journalists. "You don't have to be superficial," Brand said. "That's the problem with current affairs. You forget about what's important, you allow the agenda to be decided by superficial information. Watch the awkwardness above.

| License Photo	BALTIMORE, Oct. 24 (UPI) -- A 3-year-old Mississippi child born with HIV and treated with early aggressive therapy of anti-viral drugs remains "cured" of the disease, her doctors say.An infant was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 35 weeks to a woman who had received no prenatal care. Rapid HIV-1 testing in the mother was positive during labor and delivery occurred before anti-retroviral prophylaxis -- preventive medical treatment started immediately after exposure to a pathogen -- was administered. Maternal HIV-1 infection was confirmed. A combination of anti-viral drugs initiated in the infant at 30 hours of age to minimize the likelihood of generating resistant viral variants in the event that the infant had been infected in utero with HIV. The infant remained on anti-virals until 18 months of age, at which point the child was lost to follow-up for a while and, physicians said, stopped treatment. Upon return to care, about 10 months after treatment stopped, the child underwent repeated standard HIV tests, none of which detected virus in the blood. Early findings of the case were presented in March during a scientific meeting in Atlanta. However, the report published in the New England Journal of Medicine adds detail and confirms what researchers say is the first documented case of HIV remission in a child.The child's experience provides compelling evidence that HIV-infected infants can achieve viral remission if anti-retroviral therapy begins within hours or days of infection, the child's doctors said."Our findings suggest that this child's remission is not a mere fluke but the likely result of aggressive and very early therapy that may have prevented the virus from taking a hold in the child's immune cells," said lead author Dr. Deborah Persaud, a virologist and pediatric HIV expert at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center. Persaud teamed up with immunologist Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and pediatrician Dr. Hannah Gay of the University of Mississippi Medical Center, who identified and treated the baby and continues to see the child."We're thrilled that the child remains off medication and has no detectable virus replicating," Gay said. "We've continued to follow the child, obviously, and she continues to do very well. There is no sign of the return of HIV, and we will continue to follow her for the long term."

Bill Brutto said he took the 1-ounce gold bar to a local pawn shop, where it was appraised at approximately $1,200.Brutto said a private donor has agreed to trade the gold bar for its full cash value."I've never seen anything like it before," he said. "It's always been a Christmas tradition so to be a part of it is really cool."Brutto said the total of the year's donations will be announced after all donations have been collected and counted. He said donations are being collected until the end of the year.

| License Photo	BOSTON, June 1 (UPI) -- Boston Celtics center Shaquille O'Neal announced Wednesday he is retiring after 19 years in the NBA.O'Neal disclosed his decision to call it quits in a short video on tout.com. He also put a link to the video in a Twitter message."We did it. Nineteen years, baby," O'Neal said in the video. "I want to thank you very much, and that's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon."The 7-foot-1 O'Neal, 39, won four NBA titles -- three with the Los Angeles Lakers and one with Miami -- was an all-star 15 times and was the league's MVP in 2000.He also played for Orlando, Phoenix, Cleveland and Boston.[View the story "Goodbye Shaq" on Storify]This past season he was plagued by injuries. He was out between Feb. 1 and April 3 with a strained Achilles. Only 5 1/2 minutes into his return, he hurt his right calf and played just 12 minutes in two playoff games in the Eastern Conference semifinal series.O'Neal ranks fifth all-time in points scored (28,596). He averaged 23.7 points, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks in 1,207 career games, making 58.2 percent of his field goals but just 52.7 percent of his free throws."For 19 seasons, Shaquille O'Neal was literally and figuratively an NBA giant," NBA Commissioner David Stern said. "On behalf of the NBA, its teams, and his millions of fans around the world, I want to thank Shaq for everything he has meant to the league and to the sport of basketball, both on and off the court."

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Aug. 3 (UPI) -- Wil Myers singled home Desmond Jennings with the winning run in the 10th inning Saturday, lifting Tampa Bay to a 2-1 interleague win over San Francisco.The score had been tied 1-1 since the third inning when the Rays finally broke through was a run in the 10th against Giants reliever Jean Machi (2-1).Jennings coaxed a walk to lead off the inning and stole second. Ben Zobrist was intentionally walked to get to the slumping Evan Longoria, but he also managed a walk to load the bases.With the Giants outfield playing in, Myers sent a fly ball over the head of left fielder Jeff Francoeur to push Jennings home with the game-winner.Fernando Rodney (4-2) picked up the victory after Rays starter David Price had yielded just one run on five hits over nine innings.Zobrist got the other RBI for second-place Tampa Bay, which stayed one game behind Boston in the American League East.San Francisco's Tim Lincecum threw seven innings of one-run ball but was saddled with a no-decision.Brandon Crawford got the Giants' only RBI.

WASHINGTON, March 20 (UPI) -- As U.S. President Barack Obama arrives in Israel for his first state visit, clearly Iran will dominate the agenda along with discussions over Syria, the Arab Spring and even the Palestinian issue (although Israeli settlements in occupied territories may be missing in action as too politically sensitive).In last week's interview for Israeli television, Obama concluded that Iran was at least a year removed from achieving a useable nuclear weapon. The intent was to dampen any enthusiasm for an attack this year on the part of newly re-elected Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.And Obama's address to the Israeli public (and not the Knesset) will doubtlessly incorporate that argument.Meanwhile, the political process in Washington over competing budgets remains deadlocked. A continuing resolution to keep government functioning through the end of this fiscal year, Sept. 30, 2013, may pass this week. But the divide between Republicans and Democrats over how best to grow the economy and deal with the federal debt appears unbridgeable.Obama has adopted the Dick Cheney economic view that deficits don't count and that the nearly $17 trillion debt isn't an imminent danger. Hence, in the Democratic view, more and not less spending is the key to growth. And more spending will require more taxes presumably on the so-called rich.Republicans say the opposite. Growth comes from creating jobs and, critically, a vibrant, productive and growing economy. Debts and deficits are huge matters especially when interest rates rise, which at some point they must and debt service will bust an already unbalanced budget.Regarding Iran and foreign policy and the domestic economy, what questions might be put to Obama and his administration that haven't been asked and should be?First, with respect to Iran, have we fully examined all the means for retarding or preventing enrichment of uranium to weapons standard short of a military strike?We know that the majority of Iran's centrifuges are obsolete and Tehran is in the process replacement. We also know that the weakest link of any centrifuge is magnetic bearings vital to achieving sufficient centrifugal force required for enrichment. We also know that these bearings frequently burn out especially in old machines. If Iran is getting its magnetic bearings from external sources, can they be halted?Second, the president says all options are on the table including (presumably in the last resort) military action. If all options are on the table, do they include containment? If not, then all options are NOT on the table.Third, based on the United States' most recent uses of military force in Afghanistan and Iraq, is the president prepared to think the "unthinkable?" Obviously, surgical strikes that eliminate or at least delay Iran's nuclear programs substantially would top the options list if force were to be used. And equally obvious would be Iran's responses.But suppose that such attacks that lasted days or a few weeks and targeted Iranian air defenses and naval forces as well as other possible military installations couldn't guarantee success to an acceptable level of confidence? Would the president seek first a resolution from Congress for using force or a declaration of war? Indeed, would the president consider an invasion and occupation of Iran to guarantee that Tehran would never field nuclear weapons? And if an invasion were politically impossible, would the president contemplate using nuclear weapons as the best or only guarantor of ending Iran's weapons ambitions?Responses to these "unthinkable" questions won't arise as none is likely to be asked. However, if we are really serious about preventing Iran from achieving a real nuclear weapons capability, no question should be off the table.Turning to the economy, the two overriding, interrelated requirements are job creation and economic growth. With diametrically opposed philosophies and a political system deadlocked by divided government, one obvious question that hasn't been addressed, must be asked and answered: Mr. President, why have you not embraced an infrastructure bank?U.S. infrastructure, from bridges, roads, power grids to the Internet, is an embarrassment as well as danger to the nation.An infrastructure bank of about $1-2 trillion would be financed by the private sector with bond issues at 3 or 4 percentage points above prime; paid for by user fees or real estate taxes as property values increase; and guaranteed by the government. This bank would create millions of jobs; repair and modernize this infrastructure; and most of all, stimulate and grow the economy. And it can be created through the already existing Export-Import Bank.Whether these questions will arise in the first place is doubtful. Hence, no answers will be forthcoming. But that doesn't mean these questions shouldn't be asked in the first place.--(Harlan Ullman is chairman of the Killowen Group, which advises leaders of government and business, and senior adviser at Washington's Atlantic Council.)--(United Press International's "Outside View" commentaries are written by outside contributors who specialize in a variety of important issues.

TEHRAN, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Iran Sunday launched a domestically made long range high-altitude drone, state media reported.At a ceremony marking Defense Industry Day, the Islamic Republic unveiled what it described as its first stealth bomber drone called Karrar, the Iranian Student's News Agency, ISNA, said.The unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV, is capable of flying at high altitude for long distances at high speed, ISNA said.Press TV said the drone is capable of carrying a military payload of rockets to bomb targets on the ground.Earlier this month, the Fars news agency said Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi described the drone as having bombing and reconnaissance capabilities. In March 2009, Iran started construction of a plant in the northern province of Mazandaran to mass produce various types of UAVs. Hamed Saeedi, managing director of Farnas Aerospace Co. in charge of the project, said plans are under way to produce additional drones and unmanned choppers.

| License Photo	JERUSALEM, Jan. 1 (UPI) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry went to Israel Wednesday on what officials say is part of the shuttle diplomacy to keep the Mideast peace effort advancing.Kerry is making a major push to secure what the Obama administration called a "framework" accord seen as critical to a wide-ranging Middle East peace accord and critics branded as a bid for more time, the New York Times reported.Kerry is expected to make several trips to the region in January and February to secure the framework agreement quickly, U.S. officials said. Kerry has targeted the end of April for completing a comprehensive peace accord. The framework's goal is to achieve enough of a coming together on core issues that the two sides can push toward a formal peace agreement, State Department officials said. The document wouldn't be signed by Israeli and Palestinian leaders and likely would note reservations each side has, American officials said. "Once they have a shared vision of what that will look like, then it will become easier to finalize the details," a senior State Department official told the Times.Among the core issues to be resolved are the borders between Israel and a future Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem as a possible capital for the new Palestinian state as well as Israel, recognition that Israel be identified as a Jewish state and a Palestinian demand that refugees have the right to return to their former homes, the Times said. Critics said the move was an effort to buy time and formally establish the negotiating process that could go past the timeline Kerry set during the summer for completing a peace treaty. "It is clear that Kerry cannot get a comprehensive 'final status agreement' in his nine-month timetable, so now he appears to be looking at a 'framework agreement' instead," said Elliott Abrams, a senior official on President George W. Bush's National Security Council. "I don't think it will work."
