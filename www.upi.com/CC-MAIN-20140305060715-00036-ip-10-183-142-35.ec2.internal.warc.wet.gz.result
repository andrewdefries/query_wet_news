WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UPI) -- Residential construction starts and permits issued both rose sharply in 2012 over 2011, the U.S. Department of Commerce said Thursday.Project starts rose 28.1 percent with construction on an estimated 780,000 housing units begun in the year.Permits issued rose 30.3 percent to an estimated 813,400, Commerce said.For the final month of the year, privately owned housing starts came to 954,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up 12.1 percent from a revised November figure of 851,000.Starts in December were 36.9 percent higher than December 2011.The department said housing permits for private projects rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 903,000 in the month from a revised November level of 900,000, a 0.3 percent gain.Permits issued were also sharply higher than a year earlier, gaining 28.8 percent above the 701,000 permits issued in December 2011.Residential project completions came to an annual rate of 686,000 in December on a seasonally adjusted basis, a 1.6 percent gain over November and a 13.2 percent gain over December 2011, Commerce said in a release issued jointly with the Department of Housing and Urban Development.For the year, private project completions rose 11.4 percent to 651,400, a total that reflects the number of housing units completed.Economists keep an eye on construction starts on their own merits, but also due to the likelihood that new homeowners spend money on items such as lawn mowers, ladders, rugs, curtains, furniture and appliances.

| License Photo	YUMA, Ariz., March 16 (UPI) -- Initial operational testing and evaluation of the U.S. military's semi-active, laser-guided, 2.75-inch rocket was completed by the U.S. Marine Corps.The testing involved firing rockets from AH-1W and UH-1Y helicopters at stationary and moving targets from varying distances and in varying combat scenarios."APKWS has successfully completed more than 80 shots in the past few months," said John Watkins, director of Missile and Munitions Solutions for BAE Systems in Nashua, New Hampshire, where the mid-body guidance section is built."This testing is the culmination of a highly successful development effort among BAE Systems, our partners and suppliers and the U.S. government."These shots demonstrate that APKWS will make a difference in allowing aviators to do their jobs and come home safely."APKWS stands for Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System. The system transforms a standard 2.75-inch unguided rocket into a laser-guided missile that is effective against targets while reducing collateral damage, the company said.It is an "unpack and shoot" weapon that uses standard rocket launchers as well as the existing warheads, fuses and rocket motors that currently exist in inventory.It is being deployed in Afghanistan this month."APKWS is a highly effective and affordable weapon that will allow aviators to complete their missions while minimizing the risk of harm to allies and non-combatants," said U.S. Navy Capt. Brian Corey, program manager, PMA-242. "We are looking forward to bringing APKWS forward to our Marines in combat."BAE Systems has been the prime contractor for the APKWS since 2008. To date, 400 production systems have been added to the Navy's weapons inventory.In addition to the Marine helicopters, the rocket has been successfully fired from U.S. Army helicopters and is being viewed for use on U.S. Air Force and Navy planes and unmanned aerial vehicles.

WASHINGTON, April 23 (UPI) -- The collapse of socialism has enticed commentators to make rash generalizations about causality in human affairs.Joshua Muravchik told an American Enterprise Institute forum on Monday that he structured his new book, "Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism," as a string of biographical portraits "in defiance of the Marxian canon that history is the interplay of forces rather than human individuals."Columnist Charles Krauthammer praised the book's epistemology. "Unlike the way socialism tells history -- which is from the bottom up, the material substructure, the economic structure, to the spiritual superstructure -- he tells it from the top down. He tells it from the story of ideas, and he endorses the theory that men make history and not the other way around."This point of view is true, Krauthammer said.But some people who abhor the idea of a centrally planned economy, state ownership of the means of production, the violence of compelled collectivization and the leadership of a self-appointed revolutionary "vanguard" nevertheless believe that Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels made an important contribution to Western thought.That is the realization that although ideas certainly affect behavior, constraints in the material world shape thought. This was the theme of the life work of my mentor in anthropology, the late Marvin Harris (1927-2001), who was reviled by Marxists in and out of the academy for being a "vulgar" or "mechanical" materialist.Harris' offense was in rejecting the religious element of doctrinaire Marxism -- i.e., Georg Hegel's idea that social formations develop internal contradictions that at once cause their own destruction and form the basis of emerging new institutions.Muravchik addressed the essentially theological nature of the Hegelian dialectic in his talk. He began by reviewing the loopy Utopian fantasies of Robert Owen (1771-1858), the British factory owner who came to the United States in 1825 to establish a commune in Indiana. The irony, Muravchik said, was that socialism proved that it could not work at its inception, with the failure of such communes in the first half of the 19th century. But Marx and Engels raised the ideology behind these fuzzy experiments to a prophetic religion."Marx was one of history's most thoroughgoing misanthropes," Muravchik said. "He not only hated his enemies, but he hated and despised his own followers. ... Above all, he hated the Jews, having been born one himself."Muravchik said his research has shown that Marx's masterpiece, "Das Kapital," "has more or less never been read by anyone ... because the work is essentially unreadable."Engels, Marx's financial benefactor, brought Marx's message to the world -- that socialism would not come about by human devising but by an inexorable historical dynamic. Muravchik said this transformed socialism from Utopianism to the recognition of a "scientific" principle by which the faithful could divine the future. In that way, Marx and Engels "made a religion and called it science."This is all very well, but it will not do to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Ideas do not emerge from thin air.Farm families, for example, have more children than urban families. If natalist ideology is stronger in the country than in town, it because children are useful agricultural workers and city kids are consumers of expensive resources.Epistemology aside, the comments of Muravchik and Krauthammer were incisive. Socialism was an idea that more than any other shaped the bloody history of the 20th century, Muravchik said. Until 1989 it arguably was the most popular idea of all time, apart from Christianity."It took Christianity some 300 years before it could claim to speak for 10 percent of the world's population (and) 1,900 years before it could claim to hold the adherents of a third of mankind. Yet socialism took a mere 150 years ... until by the late 1970s it ruled over more than 60 percent of the world's people," he said.Of course, not everyone ruled over by socialist regimes believed in the system. For some, the longer they were ruled by it, the less they believed it, Muravchik said. "Yet millions did believe in it, and fervently. ... It was the faith of a large part of the intellectual classes even in this least socialist of countries, all the more so in Europe and elsewhere."Moderator Irving Kristol, a founder of the neo-conservative movement, recalled the era -- around 1940 --when all his friends were socialists, including the author's father, Manny Muravchik.Joshua Muravchik said that for decades socialism persisted in spite of the failure of Marxist predictions. Under capitalism, "The workers got richer, not poorer. The middle class got more numerous; it did not disappear." The claim that the proletariat had no homeland was "blown to smithereens" in 1914, when workers and the socialist deputies in the various parliaments flocked to their country's banners.Just as the creed was being eclipsed, Muravchik said, Lenin rescued it by seizing power in Russia, the largest land power. The prophecy seemed to have been confirmed."But against socialism's failures there stood out a counter-model, and that was the successes of America. ... American workers and their own indigenous proletarian leaders examined the idea of socialism and found it wanting."The author, a resident AEI scholar, said the momentum changed in 1978-79 with the accession of Deng Xiaoping in China, who undid collective agriculture and returned to the farming of private plots of land. And Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher "set out to cure the British disease by 'killing socialism' in its democratic form as it was practiced in Europe."From there, over the course of a decade, the whole amazing episode collapsed," Muravchik said, "leaving us to ponder how this idea had been so seductive and so destructive. ... The toll was more than 100 million lives snuffed out and countless others blighted."Krauthammer said socialism's "almost Biblical" concept of perfect equality becomes, step-by-step, "coercion, restrictions, assignment of duties, assignment of wealth, assignment of everything. And you end up inexorably and inevitably with dictatorship and misery."

NEW HAVEN, Conn., Oct. 25 (UPI) -- U.S. astronomers say they've observed a band of stars believed to be the remnant of an ancient star cluster slowly being ingested by our Milky Way galaxy."The Milky Way is constantly gobbling up small galaxies and star clusters," lead study author Ana Bonaca, a Yale graduate student, said."The more powerful gravity of our Milky Way pulls these objects apart and their stars then become part of the Milky Way itself."While previous studies have found evidence of the Milky Way having a cosmic snack of dwarf galaxies, the researchers argue the newly found stellar stream is the remnant of a star cluster rather than of a larger galaxy because the stream is very narrow, a Yale release said Thursday."Our discovery is more of a light snack than a big meal for the Milky Way," co-author Marla Geha, a Yale professor of astronomy, said. "Studying this digestion process in detail is important because it gives us new insight into how all galaxies form and evolve."Named the Triangulum stream, the newly discovered river of stars could also help reconstruct how the Milky Way's mass is distributed, further revealing its dynamic structure, astronomers said.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 (UPI) -- U.S. President Obama will live up to his pledge to end the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy on gay service members, a senior Democrat said Sunday.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin of Michigan told NBC's "Meet the Press" Obama "can" and "will" succeed in ending what he said is the military's "discriminatory policy" on gays in uniform."I think it has to be done in the right way, which is to get a buy-in from the military, which I think is now possible," Levin said. "Other militaries in the West, the British and other Western armies, have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully."Levin's comments came as thousands of gay and lesbian demonstrators filled the streets of Washington Sunday to demand full equality under the law, including the right to openly serve in the armed forces, the Los Angeles Times reported, saying participants in the National Equality March stretched past the White House down Pennsylvania Avenue to the U.S. Capitol.The newspaper said they chanted Obama's "Yes we can" campaign slogan while carrying signs and banners.

WASHINGTON, April 1 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Defense says it opposes giving Purple Hearts to victims of a 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas.A position paper, delivered by the Pentagon to congressional staff members Friday, says giving the award, for injuries sustained in combat, to those injured at Fort Hood could "irrevocably alter the fundamental character of this time-honored decoration."The Defense Department prepared the paper in response to proposed legislation by Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, whose district includes the Fort Hood military base. His bill would award combatant status to both military and civilian casualties of the shooting, ABC News reported Monday.Thirteen people were killed and 32 injured in the November 2009 shootings on the base. Maj. Nidal Hasan, the alleged shooter, awaits a military trial on premeditated murder and attempted murder charges.

PARIS, Jan. 11 (UPI) -- French military action has begun against Islamist militants in Mali, President Francois Hollande said Friday afternoon.He said the intervention would last "as long as necessary," the BBC reported.Hollande said Malian President Dioncounda Traore had agreed to accept the military assistance.Journalists had been unable to confirm reports earlier Friday foreign troops and weapons began arriving in Mali Thursday to reinforce government troops. It was unclear from what country they had come.Hollande said earlier Friday France was willing to help fight Islamist militants in Mali but only with the approval of the United Nations.In a speech, the French president said the Islamists' advance through northern Mali was "blatant aggression that is threatening Mali's very existence," Voice of America reported.He said France's aid would be delivered "strictly within the framework" of a resolution by the U.N. Security Council.On Thursday, the Security Council called for "rapid deployment" of West African forces to aid the Malian government.The council's emergency meeting was called after about 1,200 Islamist forces took control of the town of Konna, less than 16 miles from Mopti, the northernmost city controlled by the Mali government.

| License Photo	Dec. 16 (UPI) --Socialist Michelle Bachelet, Chile's president from 2006 to 2010, is president again after winning the presidential run-off on Sunday.When President Sebastian Pinera called to congratulate her, Bachelet responded "I shall be president for everyone in Chile." She was the first female Chilean president and left office in 2010 with high approval ratings.Bachelet ran on a platform that advocated increased corporate taxes, better access to higher education, and revisions to Chile's constitution which is a holdover from dictator General Augusto Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime. The run-off was held since no candidate in last month's election was able to secure more than 50% of the votes necessary to win under Chilean law. In the run-off, Bachelet captured 62% of the vote over her opponent, Evelyn Matthei. Bachelet will take office in March. [CNN]
