MOSCOW, Jan. 28 (UPI) -- Despite Gazprom sending a $7 billion bill to Ukraine for 2012 gas volumes, an energy analyst in Moscow ruled out another round of crippling disputes.Gazprom in 2006 and 2009 cut natural gas supplies through Ukraine in response to contractual disputes. Those rows left downstream European consumers in the cold as most of the Russian gas bound for their region runs through Ukraine's transit system.Gazprom sent state energy company Naftogaz a $7 billion bill for not living up to the terms of its gas agreements last year.Lev Snykov, a partner at Greenwich Capital in Moscow, however, told Bloomberg News he didn't "think there will be a third gas war."Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is serving a seven-year prison sentence after being convicted on charges she abused her authority when she helped break the 2009 impasse. Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said the deal was "enslaving."Bloomberg states that Ukraine paid $430 per 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas in December under the terms of a take-or-pay deal with Gazprom. That's $30 more than Gazprom charges other European customers.Ukraine last year imported 32.9 billion cubic meters of natural gas. The country has looked to foreign companies interested in its shale natural gas reserves as a way to break the Russian grip on its energy sector.

June 23 (UPI) -- Bruno Mars began his Moonshine Jungle Tour at Washington D.C.'s Verizon Center on Saturday, performing singles from his current album, "Unorthodox Jukebox." The 27-year-old singer told Ryan Seacrest on Friday that his show would be light on visual effects and heavy on sound -- “I want the music to be more rockin’ than the visual effects. I prefer [a show] that’s a bit more raw," Mars said. He mostly held true to that promise on Saturday, when he performed a sultry version of "Gorilla" underneath a solo spotlight (though he couldn't resist a few fire blasts. You an also check out Mars' performance of "Treasure," which includes a little shimmying with his musicians. Mars shared his tour-launch excitement with fans before the show. "FIRST SHOW! Yes im excited. Yes Im all the way turnt up and Yes my lip gloss is poppin," he wrote. "Thank you DC!" Mars tweeted afterward. "Last night was magical for me. WE BACK AT IT!!!"

COLLEGE PARK, Md., Aug. 5 (UPI) -- U.S.-led scientists say they've used math and medicine to demonstrate how the two disciplines, when combined, might lead to a cure for cancer.University of Maryland Associate Professor of mathematics Doron Levy, Stanford Medical School Associate Professor Dr. Peter Lee and Peter Kim of the Ecole Superieure d'Electricite in France said they have created a mathematical model that predicts anti-leukemia immune response in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients using the drug imatinib."By combining novel biological data and mathematical modeling, we found rules for designing adaptive treatments for each specific patient," said Levy, who led the study. "Give me a thousand patients and, with this mathematical model, I can give you a thousand different customized treatment plans."Researchers previously used equations in attempts to understand how leukemia develops and evolves. The new research, said Levy, differs in that it took into account the patient's natural immune response in conjunction with the effects of imatinib."The mathematical model helps us understand the mechanisms that control the disease and show how to use this knowledge to our advantage," Levy said.The research appeared in the June 20 issue of the journal PLoS Computational Biology.

| License Photo	PARIS, June 8 (UPI) -- Maria Sharapova can join some of the most storied names in women's tennis with a French Open win.Sharapova, who will be ranked No. 1 in the world effective Monday, goes against Sara Errani, the tournament's No. 21 seed, in Saturday's singles final.A win over Errani, who she's never played before, would give Sharapova the personal Grand Slam. She has won at Wimbledon (2004), the U.S. Open (2006) and the Australian Open (2008) but Saturday marks her first appearance in the finals at Roland Garros.If she does complete the personal slam, Sharapova, 25, would join Margaret Court, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf and Serena Williams as the only women to accomplish the feat in the Open Era. Maureen Connolly Brinker, Doris Hart, Shirley Fry Irvin and Billy Jean King also won the personal Grand Slam.Sharapova reached the final with a 6-3, 6-3 win Thursday over fourth-ranked Petra Kvitova. She has dropped just one set in her first six matches in the tournament and only twice lost more than three games in a set.Errani, also 25, is far from the big name Sharapova is. She had only reached one Grand Slam quarterfinal before the French Open before she ousted sixth-seeded Samantha Stosur in her semifinal 7-5, 1-6, 6-3.Errani beat 10th-ranked Angelique Kerber in the quarters. Before that she had been 0-28 versus Top 10 players. Now she is 2-28 and, as of Monday, she'll be a Top 10 player herself.Sharapova was never before known as a competitor with great success on clay courts but is 16-1 on them this year. Errani, too, has been strong on clay this year. At one point she'd won 16 consecutive matches on the surface, picking up titles at Acapulco, Barcelona and Budapest.

BRUSSELS, Feb. 19 (UPI) -- Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was looking into allegations that spare arms supplies had been shipped through Finland to Syria.Finnish shipping company Finnlines Oyj last week turned over banned spare tank parts to Helsinki authorities. The shipment originated from St. Petersburg, Russia.Lavrov said from Brussels that Russian arms exporter Rosoboronexport wasn't involved in the shipments."There was no governmental cargo on the ship and so we're trying to make inquiries into this report," he was quoted by Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti as saying.The Russian company said its relationship with the Syrian military was in line with existing contracts. Finnish authorities didn't reveal the origin country involved in the arms shipment.The European Union rejected a push this week to amend an arms embargo in Syria in order to facilitate aid to anti-government forces."The (European) Council agreed to renew the restrictive measures against Syria for a further three months, amending them so as to provide greater non-lethal support and technical assistance for the protection of civilians," a Monday statement read.Russia is one of Syria's top weapons suppliers. Moscow, which holds a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, has objected to draft resolutions on Syria, saying they lack balance.An estimated 70,000 people have died in the Syrian civil war.

EAGAN, Minn., Jan. 15 (UPI) -- A Minnesota lawyer has been suspended indefinitely for billing a divorce client for time they spent having sex.The state Supreme Court invoked the suspension against Thomas P. Lowe, 58, of Eagan, in a ruling last Thursday, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported Tuesday. Lowe will have to wait at least 15 months before getting an opportunity to seek reinstatement.The newspaper said Lowe had known the woman for many years. He became her attorney in her divorce case after she came to him in August 2011.They soon began an affair that lasted for several months, during which Lowe, who was married, periodically billed her for legal services provided at the times they were having sex, the newspaper. Their liaisons were coded as meetings or drafting memos.After their relationship became acrimonious, Lowe told her he was ended it and soon thereafter said he would no longer be her attorney.At that point, the woman tried to kill herself and while in the hospital revealed the affair, the newspaper said.The Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility subsequently filed a case against Lowe and court documents show he eventually admitted the allegations.The newspaper said it was unable to reach Lowe for comment.

LONDON, Feb. 24 (UPI) -- Retired British businessman Christopher Tappin was handed over to U.S. marshals Friday for extradition to the United States to face arms dealing charges.Tappin, who fought extradition for two years, said he had looked to British Prime Minister David Cameron to protect his interests but "he failed to do so," The Daily Telegraph reported."I have no rights," Tappin said at Heathrow police station, where he was handed over to U.S. authorities.Tappin, 65, is accused of conspiring to sell components for Iranian missiles. If convicted in a U.S. court, he could face a possible 35 years in jail. He denies the charges. Cameron Wednesday said the government would conduct a ''proper, sober and thoughtful'' review of its extradition policies, adding that extradition treaties "show respect to each other's judicial processes and make sure that people who are accused of crimes are tried for those crimes."The Home Office was accused of a cover-up because it did not publish evidence behind a controversial review of extradition laws. Conservative lawmaker Dominic Raab said Wednesday the public may think there "was something to hide" and called on the Home Office to release the information it gave to retired Judge Scott Baker for review, the Telegraph said.Baker's review last year determined the treaty wasn't biased and didn't need to be reformed.

Watch:In fact, it appears the awkward moment was simply an accident: Ennis likely didn't see Kate's hand, since the two ladies from chatting amicably afterwards.

Wiki
Charl Adriaan Schwartzel (English pronunciation: /ˈʃɑrl ˈʃwɔrtsəl/; born 31 August 1984) is a South African professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour, European Tour, and the Sunshine Tour. He won the 2011 Masters Tournament. Schwartzel's highest world ranking has been number seven, in May 2011.
Schwartzel was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. He had a dominant junior amateur career in South Africa, and won some amateur events in other countries including the 2002 Indian Amateur and English Open Stroke Play Championships. He played for South Africa in the 2002 Eisenhower Trophy.
Schwartzel turned professional at the age of eighteen and following the path of many other leading South African players, he qualified for the European Tour late that year. He was the second youngest South African golfer to do so after Dale Hayes. He earned enough money to retain his European Tour card in both 2003 and 2004.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG

Wiki
Ross Rebagliati (born July 14, 1971) is a Canadian professional snowboarder.
Rebagliati was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He turned pro in 1991. He was the first ever to win an Olympic gold medal for this sport at the 1998 Winter Olympics. After winning the gold, he was found to have marijuana in his circulatory system and he was automatically disqualified. This decision was eventually overturned, largely on the basis that marijuana was not on the list of banned substances, and Rebagliati was given back the medal.
On August 2, 2006 Rebagliati filed suit against Canadian television broadcaster CTV. The suit was filed in the British Columbia Supreme Court, and charges CTV with misappropriation of personality, breach of privacy and defamation. Rebagliati claims that a character on their TV series Whistler is based on him and has damaged his image. The character in question, Beck MacKaye, is a blond, blue-eyed, Olympic gold medal-winning snowboarder who lives in Whistler. CTV denied his claims, but the suit was ultimately settled out of court.
