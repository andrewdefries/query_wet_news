It seems President Barack Obama, with re-election behind him, is still unable to sell his successes on the economic front.Almost to the day the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was launched, the economy stopped hemorrhaging jobs to the tune of 726,000 job losses a month and began a slow climb forward. Sure, for all the world it looked like the economy was not going anywhere. After all, $830 billion goes only so far and where that took the United States on the jobs front was to a point, roughly speaking, where the economy was adding 100,000 jobs per month, for a net gain of 826,000 jobs -- not a bad day's work. Having sold this stimulus deal with too many rosy promises, it was easy to point out that President Obama failed in his mission. He missed his marks badly, mostly because going from minus 726,000 jobs per month to zero does not sell nearly as well as going from zero into positive territory. It is expected that you start at zero, not at 726,000 jobs per month in the hole. So the only bragging rights that came with a enormous achievement was 100,000 jobs.Similarly, the gross domestic product prior to the stimulus bill was at minus 6.3 percent. The stimulus package brought it to roughly 2 percent. The only credit the president can claim, however, is a lousy 2 percent, not the net gain of 8.3 percentage points.Surprise, surprise, Republicans seized on the 100,000 jobs and the 2 percent GDP as paltry gains for an $830 billion investment, leaving Obama to crow meekly about jobs saved instead of what everyone wanted, which was new jobs created.Bragging about 100,000 jobs per month didn't cut it. About that time, however, governments in Europe were taking notice of monster debts on their ledgers and leaders there spun around. moving from a stimulus-oriented strategy to a fiscal discipline orientation. At that point, they turned their backs on their economic plight and concerned themselves with deficit control.Look where it got them. Within two years, major economic institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, were pointing out that the austerity measures were an abysmal failure. But it was too late. From BusinessLife.com, posted Sept. 9, 2011:"The debate over fiscal policy in the United States, the sovereign debt crisis in some countries of the euro area and the fact that governments have fewer options to boost growth are driving both business and consumer confidence downward. The extent of bank deleveraging, due to the impact of regulatory changes, may also have been underestimated. Earlier improvements in the labor market are now fading, hiring intentions are softening and there are greater risks that high unemployment could become entrenched."Sound familiar. It should.Flash forward to Tuesday and we find Republicans appalled that President Obama, in the face of enormous deficits that nobody likes -- penciled in tens of billions of dollars in economic stimulus for infrastructure improvements in his budget proposal. After all, deficit or not, when presidents leave the office they want to say they left the nation's roads and bridges in at least as good a condition as when they took over. More to the point, the stimulus package ran its course and Republicans, champing at the bit for the spotlight and desperate to draw attention away from the national embarrassment of the George Bush years, refused to invest another dime in the economy. Where will that get us?In international markets Wednesday, the Nikkei 225 index in Japan gained 0.39 percent, while the Shanghai composite index in China surged 2.87 percent. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong jumped 2.16 percent, while the Sensex in India rose 0.23 percent.The S&P/ASX 200 in Australia added 0.37 percent.In midday trading in Europe, the FTSE 100 index in Britain climbed 0.17 percent, while the DAX 30 in Germany rose 0.19 percent. The CAC 40 in France gained 0.24 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.16 percent.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, July 14 (UPI) -- U.S. women may be the big winners when it comes to healthcare reform, not only those who are uninsured, but those with insurance, researchers say. The report by the Commonwealth Fund, a U.S. non-profit group that conducts independent research on health policy, estimated once fully implemented, the Affordable Care Act would cover nearly all women, reducing the uninsured rate among women from 20 percent to 8 percent.Twenty percent of U.S. women -- 18.7 million -- ages 19-64 were uninsured in 2010, up from 15 percent -- 12.8 million -- in 2000, the report found. Twenty-six percent of U.S. women with health insurance ages 19-64 had medical bill problems from 2009 to 2010, 39 percent spent $1,000 or more on out-of-pocket medical costs and 43 percent said they went without recommended care, skipped seeing a doctor when they were sick, or failed to fill prescriptions because of cost, the report found. Fifty-two of U.S. women with insurance said they were confident they would be able to afford the healthcare they need if they became seriously ill. Fifty-one percent of uninsured U.S. women had a problem paying medical bills and 77 percent went without needed healthcare due to cost, the report said. In 2011, an estimated 20.4 million women benefited from provisions already implemented by the Affordable Care Act requiring all private insurance plans to provide preventive services such as screening for cervical, breast, and colon cancer; cholesterol checks; and osteoporosis and chlamydia screening without a co-pay or deductible charge. Beginning in August, private insurance plans will cover an additional set of preventive services tailored specifically for women, including family planning services without cost to them.

| License Photo	SAN DIEGO, June 24 (UPI) -- Injured San Diego Chargers linebacker Steve Foley had drunk "a staggering amount" of alcohol the night he was shot by a police officer, a city attorney says. During a trial in which Foley is suing the city of Coronado, Calif., for unjustly ending his National Football League career, the city's defense attorney said Foley's blood alcohol content of 0.21 percent was nearly three times the legal limit when he was seen getting behind the wheel of a "muscle car" and driving off, the San Diego Union Tribune reported Tuesday. Foley was followed by rookie police officer Aaron Mansker, 23, who was off-duty and out of uniform at the time. Both sides in the case agree that a confrontation between Mansker and Foley in a cul-de-sac resulted in two gunshots to Foley's knee and hip, ending his NFL career. Foley says the shooting wasn't justified, and is suing the city of Coronado for $5.5 million in future earnings."This man had an awful lot to drink -- a staggering amount, a dangerous amount," attorney Norman Watkins said of Foley on the second day of a civil trial in San Diego Superior Court, the Union Tribune reported.

NEW YORK, May 9 (UPI) -- Mike Baxter singled in Marlon Byrd from second with one away in the ninth inning Thursday, giving the New York Mets a 3-2 win over Pittsburgh.Pittsburgh tied the game on an eighth-inning home run by Pedro Alvarez and the Pirates missed a chance to take the lead in the ninth when New York center fielder Juan Lagares made a spectacular catch to rob Andrew McCutchen of an extra base hit that would have brought in a runner from first.New York then struck in the bottom half of the inning against Jason Grilli (0-1) to win the opener of a four-game series.Byrd reached to open the inning on an infield single and moved to second on a sacrifice from Andrew Brown.That brought up Baxter, pinch hitting for Legares, and he drove an 0-1 pitch to center for the game-winning hit.Bobby Parnell (4-0) picked up the victory as the fifth New York pitcher by working the top of the ninth.

WASHINGTON, June 15 (UPI) -- The elderly man accused of killing a guard at the holocaust museum in Washington remained in critical-but-stable condition Monday, prosecutors said.White supremacist James W. von Brunn, 88, was charged with using a rifle to shoot guard Stephen Johns in the chest last Wednesday at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's 14th Street entrance. Von Brunn was struck in the face when two other guards returned fire. The Washington Post said he was being treated at George Washington University Hospital.Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicole Waid and von Brunn's attorney A.J. Kramer declined to comment further on the suspect's condition, the Post said.U.S. Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola said von Brunn did not appear to be healthy enough for an arraignment for at least another week, but set a new hearing on the case for Monday, the newspaper reported.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 (UPI) -- First lady Michelle Obama Thursday announced proposed changes to food labels, including information on added sugars, to help U.S. families eat healthier.The proposed revisions to the Nutrition Facts label support Obama's Let's Move! program in its efforts to help parents make healthier choices for their families, the White House said in a release."Our guiding principle here is very simple: That you as a parent and a consumer should be able to walk into your local grocery store, pick up an item off the shelf, and be able to tell whether it's good for your family," the first lady said. "So this is a big deal, and it's going to make a big difference for families all across this country."Among the proposed changes are required information about the amount of "added sugars" in a food product, as well as updated serving size requirements based on how much Americans actually eat, and a new format that emphasizes certain elements, such as calories, serving sizes and Percent Daily Value."For 20 years consumers have come to rely on the iconic nutrition label to help them make healthier food choices," Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said. "To remain relevant, the FDA's newly proposed Nutrition Facts label incorporates the latest in nutrition science as more has been learned about the connection between what we eat and the development of serious chronic diseases impacting millions of Americans."

Latest Headlines Wiki	Wiki
Mary Shelley (née Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin; 30 August 1797 – 1 February 1851) was a British novelist, short story writer, dramatist, essayist, biographer, and travel writer, best known for her Gothic novel Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus (1818). She also edited and promoted the works of her husband, the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley. Her father was the political philosopher William Godwin, and her mother was the philosopher and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft.
Mary Godwin's mother died when she was eleven days old; afterwards, she and her older half-sister, Fanny Imlay, were raised by her father. When Mary was four, Godwin married his neighbour, Mary Jane Clairmont. Godwin provided his daughter with a rich, if informal, education, encouraging her to adhere to his liberal political theories. In 1814, Mary Godwin began a romantic relationship with one of her father’s political followers, the married Percy Bysshe Shelley. Together with Mary's stepsister, Claire Clairmont, they left for France and travelled through Europe; upon their return to England, Mary was pregnant with Percy's child. Over the next two years, she and Percy faced ostracism, constant debt, and the death of their prematurely born daughter. They married in late 1816 after the suicide of Percy Shelley's first wife, Harriet.
In 1816, the couple famously spent a summer with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Claire Clairmont near Geneva, Switzerland, where Mary conceived the idea for her novel Frankenstein. The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley gave birth to her last and only surviving child, Percy Florence. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm in the Bay of La Spezia. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was dogged by illness, probably caused by the brain tumour that was to kill her at the age of 53.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
