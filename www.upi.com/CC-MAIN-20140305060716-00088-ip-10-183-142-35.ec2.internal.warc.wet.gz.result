LONDON, Oct. 9 (UPI) -- The British government makes no apology for taking a cautious approach to the development of shale natural gas reserves, the British energy secretary said.British Energy Secretary Ed Davey told at a natural gas conference in London that he was in favor of developing shale natural gas reserves."In principle, I'm all in favor of exploiting new resources," he said. "I would welcome as much as anyone a way to boost Britain's indigenous gas supplies and to reduce energy prices to consumers and businesses alike."Cuadrilla Resources announced last year that it voluntarily halted shale gas extraction at a site in northwest England because of small tremors reported near its operations.The British Department of Energy and Climate Change had suggested hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, procedures should include small-scale operations followed by a monitoring stage. Fracking would stop immediately if a seismic event of 0.5-magnitude or greater was recorded.Davey said he makes "no apology" for exercising patience when it comes to shale natural gas reserves."I want to base our approach on the evidence, as we do for all fuel sources, and I know that industry analysts do see shale as a rather different proposition here than in the United States," he said.

Lohan could face jail time for crashLOS ANGELES, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan faces misdemeanor charges and possible jail time for allegedly lying to police about a car accident earlier this year in California. Officials in Santa Monica charged the troubled actress with three misdemeanor charges Thursday for obstructing an investigation, giving false information to an officer and reckless driving, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. Police said they have evidence Lohan lied to them when she told them she wasn't driving a Porsche when it collided with a dump truck in June on Pacific Coast Highway. A judge could sentence the troubled actress to jail time if it is determined she violated probation for her 2011 shoplifting conviction, the Times reported.The charges are the latest in a host of legal troubles the 26-year-old has faced in the last few years. She was arrested Thursday morning for assault after a fight with a woman at a New York City nightclub, police said.Lohan said she did not punch the woman, Tiffany Mitchell, but the alleged victim was spotted meeting with high-profile lawyer Gloria Allred, indicating a possible lawsuit may be on the horizon, TMZ reported.Meanwhile, CBS affiliate, WUSA-TV, Washington, D.C., polled viewers and determined it was time to stop reporting on Lohan's legal troubles, The Hollywood Reporter said.Anchor Fred D'Ambroisi asked Twitter fans if the station should ban all stories from newscasts. The answer was a resounding "yes.""OK. Due to popular demand, we just killed the :20 #LindsayLohan story in @wusa9 @5. The people have spoken!" the station's Twitter account said.'Thriller' enjoys 30 years of successNEW YORK, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- Thirty years ago, Michael Jackson was on his way to becoming the "King of Pop" with the release of the best-selling studio album in U.S. history, "Thriller.""Thirty years ago the greatest album ever made was released and it still stands the test of time," longtime Jackson watcher and author Stacy Brown told ABCNews.com Friday, the day of the album's anniversary."Thriller" was the first album to feature seven Hot 100 top 10s, including "Billie Jean" and "Beat It," which took the No. 1 spot, Billboard reported. The album was at the top of the Billboard 200 for 37 weeks, more than any other album by a single artist.The Recording Industry Association of America lists the album as the best-selling studio album in U.S. history, with 29 million copies sold. "Thriller" is tied with the Eagles' "Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975" for the overall domestic title.Estimates of worldwide sales are as high as 110 million albums sold, Billboard reported."Thriller" earned Jackson seven Grammy awards in 1984, including album and record of the year. Nick Lachey to host NBC singing contestHOLLYWOOD, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- U.S. singer Nick Lachey has been tapped by NBC to host a hybrid singing game show tentatively named "The Winner Is," the network said.Lachey had previously served in the same capacity for NBC on another singing competition show, "Sing-Off" for three seasons from 2009 to 2011, The Hollywood Reporter said Friday.John de Mol, of "The Voice," created the new show and will act as an executive producer alongside "The Voice's" Stijn Bakkers and "Deal of No Deal's" Craig Plestis. "With Nick at the helm on air and an original format from Talpa [Media USA] that includes surprising and competitive twists, viewers are sure to be immersed and entertained," said Paul Telegdy, NBC alternative late-night programming president."The Winner Is" will feature a series of pairs of contestants who will perform before a panel of judges. After, the contestants can cut a deal with the judges and exit the show with a cash prize if they think their performance was sub-par. If they choose to remain in the game, the judge can either eliminate the contestant or move them to the next round and one step closer to the ultimate $1 million prize, The Hollywood Reporter said.Report: Panettiere ran red light, crashedNASHVILLE, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- Actress Hayden Panettiere ran a red light in Tennessee last month, causing an accident with another driver who also broke traffic rules, a police report said.The crash took place Nov. 14 in Nashville, where the actress films her ABC show, "Nashville," TMZ reported. Panettiere ran a red light with her BMW, while at the same time the other driver -- in a Geo Prism -- illegally turned into the actress' lane, the accident report said.Panettiere was driving in the right lane through an intersection when the Prism driver made a left turn into her lane instead of the left lane, the report said. A witness told police the actress had run a red light.No one was seriously injured in the crash, TMZ reported.

CHICAGO, April 12 (UPI) -- A jutting jaw line or a square chin may not be as universally considered sexy as scientists had assumed, U.S. researchers suggest. Lead author Zaneta Thayer, a doctoral student at Northwestern University, and Seth Dobson of Dartmouth College said one of the theories behind universal facial attractiveness is that some facial features are universally preferred because they are reliable signals of mate quality.But that doesn't seem to be the case with the chin, and the research challenges the assumption that the chin, commonly discussed in universal facial attractiveness literature, is consistent in shape across human populations, the researchers said. The current study builds on previous research Thayer and Dobson conducted in 2010. They evaluated competing theories for the adaptive significance of the human chin. Thayer stressed humans are the only primates with a chin, one of the unique characteristics that defines our species."We found that the indigenous Australian population had the most unique chin shape pattern relative to other populations," Thayer said in a statement. "That said, even after removing this population from the analysis, significant differences remained between other populations."The study, published in the journal PLoS One, found significant geographic differences in the chin shapes challenging Darwin's theory -- at least with regard to chin shape -- that sexual selection results in the proliferation of physical characteristics that provide a competitive advantage in the struggle to find mates.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Feb. 8 (UPI) -- A Malaysian airline has designated adults-only "quiet zones" on its planes to keep passengers from being disturbed by loud babies and toddlers.Air Asia X said its five-times-a-week flights from Australia's Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur now have "quiet zones" in seven rows of economy class reserved exclusively for passengers over age 12, the Brisbane (Australia) Courier-Mail reported Friday.Tickets for the quiet zone cost an extra $15 for the 6-hour flights."It is important to emphasize that we are a very family friendly airline and welcome all passengers," an airline spokesman said. "It's a seating innovation introduced to provide greater choice for guests. The quiet zone seating area comprises 63 seats out of a total seating capacity of 377, so it only applies to a small section of the aircraft. There's plenty of room for families with children."

WASHINGTON, July 31 (UPI) -- U.S. Joint Chiefs chairman-nominee Adm. Michael Mullen told his confirmation hearing in Washington Tuesday he is increasingly perturbed about Iran.In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mullen, who would replace Marine Gen. Peter Pace, warned strife in the Arab and Islamic worlds "bear directly on the safety of the United States.""I'm especially concerned about the increasingly hostile role played by Iran," Mullen said. "I support diplomatic efforts to counter Iran's destabilizing behavior and hope their leaders will choose to act responsibly, but I find their support for terrorism and their nuclear ambitions deeply troubling."Saying Iraq "weighs heavily" on his mind, Mullen said he believes the U.S. troop surge is doing what it is supposed to do, giving commanders the forces they need to improve security and the government of Iraq breathing space.

CHICAGO, Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Education officials say bake sales are on the wane as hundreds of U.S. school districts try to limit the amount of junk food consumed by students.As many as 600 school districts nationwide now have policies limiting the amount of fat, sugar and salt in food sold at schools, said Jamie Chriqui, a researcher with the Institute for Health Research and Policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. School officials want the restrictions to "do for junk food what smoking bans and taxes did for tobacco," Chriqui said.The restrictions are taking their toll on bake sales, traditionally used to raise money for myriad school activities, The New York Times reported Monday, noting Kentucky has the strictest regulations.In Piedmont, Calif., the boys water polo team ran through school in their Speedos to promote their bake sale -- once held at school but now held across the street off school grounds."I know obesity is a big problem, and it's good the school cares," said Piedmont senior Sam Cardoza. "At the same time, you shouldn't stop a kid from buying a cookie."

| License Photo	PRINCETON, N.J., Sept. 19 (UPI) -- Among U.S. adults who make less than $24,000 a year in household income, 34 percent say they will vote for Republican nominee Mitt Romney, a survey indicates. An analysis of Gallup Daily tracking data for the three-week period from Aug. 27 to Sept. 16 showed income was correlated with voter support, but it is not a total determinant of vote choice.President Barack Obama, a Democrat, has a substantial voting edge over Romney among low-income Americans -- two-thirds of adults said they would vote for the president, but although Romney does better with those with incomes $180,000 or more, about 40 percent of U.S. adults who make $180,000 a year or more favor Obama. A newly released video clip of Romney at a fundraiser shows him saying Obama's base supporters -- "47 percent" of Americans -- are people who pay no income tax and depend on government services.Older Americans who have low incomes are those who have the highest chance of paying no income tax, but Gallup data for Aug. 27 to Sept. 16 showed among those voters age 65 and older who have $24,000 a year in income or less, Obama was favored by 49 percent and 43 percent supported Romney.Recent Gallup Daily tracking data showed Romney had significant support among those with the lowest incomes, the young, the old, and the older voters who have low incomes -- the groups most likely to pay no taxes. The Gallup Daily tracking survey conducted Aug. 27 to Sept. 16 of 9,839 registered voters has a margin of error of 1 percentage point.

CHICAGO, Jan. 7 (UPI) -- Chicago may not ban gun dealers from selling guns or stop private individuals from giving or selling them, a federal judge ruled, citing the Second Amendment.The city's 2010 blanket ban on gun sales and transfers within city limits "goes too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions and lawful sales of firearms," U.S. District Court Judge Edmond E. Chang said."The stark reality facing the city each year is thousands of shooting victims and hundreds of murders committed with a gun," he said."But on the other side of this case is another feature of government: Certain fundamental rights are protected by the Constitution, put outside government's reach, including the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense under the Second Amendment," the judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois said in a 35-page decision, which can be found at tinyurl.com/UPI-Gun-Ruling.Chang -- appointed by President Obama, who supports stronger gun-safety laws -- said regulation and licensing, or even a law that's less restrictive than a blanket ban, could ease most of the city's gun-violence concerns and still let law-abiding citizens exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.Chang said he would temporarily delay his ruling to let Chicago decide if it will appeal.Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a defendant in the case, "strongly disagrees" with the judge's decision and has instructed city attorneys "to consider all options to better regulate the sale of firearms within the city's borders," city Law Department spokesman Roderick Drew said in a statement."Every year Chicago Police recover more illegal guns than officers in any city in the country, a factor of lax federal laws as well as lax laws in Illinois and surrounding states related to straw purchasing and the transfer of guns," he said.Straw purchasers use their clean criminal backgrounds to buy guns for criminals."We need stronger gun-safety laws, not increased access to firearms within the city," Drew said.City attorneys had argued the gun sale ban made it harder for criminals to get their hands on weapons.The Illinois Association of Firearm Retailers, which was among the plaintiffs that filed the 2010 lawsuit, was quick to predict neighborhood gun stores would open before the end of the year, the Chicago Sun-Times said.Illinois National Rifle Association lobbyist Todd Vandermyde told the Chicago Tribune none of the city's arguments were upheld by the judge."The city is going to have to allow retail gun shops to operate and they are going to have to allow individuals to transfer firearms in normal transactions," he said. "So the question now is: How much more money does Rahm [Emanuel] want to spend fighting it?"

RESOLUTE, Nunavut, Sept. 10 (UPI) -- A helicopter traveling with the Canadian coast guard cutter Amundsen crashed into the Arctic Ocean, killing all three men aboard, officials said.The victims of the 6 p.m. EDT Monday crash were identified as the pilot, Daniel Dube, age 55 or 56; Marc Thibault, 47 or 48, the Amundsen's commanding officer; and Klaus Hochheim, 55, an arctic scientist affiliated with the University of Manitoba.The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported the chopper, a Messerschmitt BO 105S, was reconnoitering the ice in the area when it went down in McClure Strait, about 373 miles of Resolute, Nunavut.A coast guard representative said Tuesday weather conditions in the area of the crash were "clear, with good visibility."Crew from the Amundsen recovered the bodies, and the ship was expected to return to Resolute Wednesday, the CBC said. The ship had recently departed from Resolute."Commandant Thibault and Daniel and Klaus were friends," Louis Fortier, the mission's scientific director, said. "And this is the main message this morning, it's the sadness for those people with whom we've been working with for 10 years now and it's a major loss."Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered the country's condolences to the victims' families and friends."It is a grim reminder of the very real dangers faced on a regular basis by those brave individuals who conduct research and patrol our arctic -- one of the harshest and most challenging climates in the world -- to better understand and protect Canada's North," Harper said in a statement."The courage and dedication of these three brave individuals will be honored and remembered."The Canadian Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.
