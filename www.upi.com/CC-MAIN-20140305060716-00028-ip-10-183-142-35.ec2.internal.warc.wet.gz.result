CALGARY, Alberta, Feb. 14 (UPI) -- Encana Corp. boss Doug Suttles said the Canadian company ended 2013 on a high note despite problems caused by Colorado flooding."We finished 2013 strong and we're well positioned to deliver on our priorities and objectives in 2014," the company's president and chief executive officer said in a statement Thursday.The company said it averaged 53,900 barrels per day of production last year, a 74 percent increase from the previous year. In terms of natural gas, it said last year's average output of 2.7 billion cubic feet per day was in line with its target but expected gas production to decline in 2014.Encana temporarily closed more than 30 percent of its wells in Colorado after more than a foot of rain fell on the state in September, causing floods.The company said it now has six rigs in place in Colorado's Denver-Julesburg basin, up from two reported last year. Encana said drilling of six wells in the Duvernay shale reserve in Canada should be completed by March. The Alberta Geological Survey estimates the area holds more than 440 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and nearly 62 billion barrels of oil.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Oct. 3 (UPI) -- Northern Irish film star Liam Neeson says he is flattered to be offered a flurry of action-hero roles at this stage of his career."Hollywood likes to pigeon-hole you," the 60-year-old actor told reporters at a recent roundtable interview in New York to promote his new thriller, "Taken 2.""After 'Schindler's List,' I was pigeon-holed in a certain way and then with the success of 'Taken,' I was re-pigeon-holed again," he said. "I started receiving quite a number of action scripts where the hero is obviously 30 years of age, but they changed it to late 40s, early 50s. It's quite flattering."Asked if he is surprised to find himself with a "badass" image, the star of "The Grey," "Battleship," "The A-Team," "Clash of the Titans," "Gangs of New York," "Kinsey," "Love Actually," "Rob Roy" and "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" smiled and replied, "Am I a badass?"Told by a journalist he is indeed, Neeson quipped: "But sensitive. I'm hardly the Terminator." "We tried to do stuff that wasn't superhuman. I wanted to show a guy who is 60," he said, referring to Bryan Mills, his "Taken 2" character, an ex-CIA operative trying to protect his family from vengeful enemies who want to abduct them in Istanbul, Turkey. "He gets tired when he runs and all. That stuff's getting harder to do. I think they showed that in the last fight in the film. We're slipping and sliding all over the place and getting dirty and grimy." Pressed to speculate about why the "Taken" films resonate with audiences, Neeson explained: "We all belong to families and we all know how important family is. "The parents in the room, myself included, will do anything for your kids," the single father of two teenage sons said. "So, I think that tapped into something in people. I also think -- it's my own little theory; you can agree with it or not -- but in 2008-09, the world was turned upside-down financially and our so-called leaders, the pillars of our community, were shafting us, let's face it, and huge criminal acts [were committed] with vast amounts of our money, and I think people felt vulnerable and nervous and a little bit scared, and when people are feeling like that, they want entertainment. And the ones who went to see 'Taken' [in 2009] saw a guy who's not going to call a figure of authority to help him. He's going to do something about it himself. I think people got a real guilty pleasure out of it." The first film followed Mills as he rescued his teenage daughter from a human-trafficking ring after she is kidnapped while on vacation with a friend in Paris. The sequel is about what happens when the survivors of one of the villains Mills killed in the original movie try to make him pay for his actions. Co-starring Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen as Mills' daughter and ex-wife, "Taken 2" opens in U.S. theaters Friday. It is rated R.

MINNEAPOLIS, Nov. 20 (UPI) -- Teens soaking Gummi bears with vodka can be added to other creative ways of getting drunk such as vodka-soaked tampon, Minnesota health officials say. The Minnesota Health Department, the Hennepin County Regional Poison Center and the Dakota County attorney's office sent warnings to schools about the booze-soaked Gummi bears in mid-October, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. James Backstrom, Dakota County attorney, said the spiked Gummi bears are gaining traction via the Internet, with instructions and YouTube clips readily available. "The Internet gives things life," Backstrom told the Star Tribune. "Kids are drinking way more than their parents. It's the difference between having dialup and broadband."Minnesota is among the Top 5 states for binge drinking, along with Wisconsin, Iowa and North and South Dakota.

LONGMONT, Colo., April 11 (UPI) -- Police in Colorado said they arrested a woman accused of choking and pushing her boyfriend because he wouldn't stop singing the popular song "Thrift Shop."The Longmont Police Department and the Boulder County Sheriff's Office said officers responded to the couple's apartment Saturday night, the alleged victim's birthday, and Samantha Malson, 23, told them she and Lars Hansen, 26, had been "fighting all evening" because Hansen accused Malson of consuming all the alcohol in the home, The Smoking Gun website reported Thursday.Malson said she left the house for a short time and eventually returned and listened to "Thrift Shop" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. The arrest report said Malson became angry when Hansen sang along to the tune and kept singing when the song was over.Malson said she asked Hansen to stop "25 times" before she "grabbed him around the throat" for "intimidation.""He just annoyed me," she said.Malson was arrested on charges of harassment and domestic violence.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, March 27 (UPI) -- The U.S. Supreme Court resumed its examination of same-sex marriage Wednesday, this time considering the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act.Justice Anthony Kennedy indicated the act, known as DOMA, violated states' rights and four other judges indicated they considered it a gay-rights issue, a tweet by Scotusblog.com said."#scotus 80% likely to strike down #doma," the tweet said "J [Justice] Kennedy suggests it violates states' rights; 4 other Justices see as gay rights."Before getting to the merits of the case, the court spent about an hour discussing whether the matter was properly brought before it, The Washington Post reported. The Obama administration has said that it would not defend the law, and lower courts have ruled DOMA unconstitutional but the administration has said it would enforce the law until the Supreme Court rules.During Wednesday's oral arguments, Justice Antonin Scalia commented on the contradictory positions, saying it was a "new world" when the attorney general could decide a law is unconstitutional but still enforce it, Post said.Kennedy, considered a potential swing vote in the case, called it a "questionable practice."LISTEN: Supreme Court hears arguments on DOMAChief Justice John Roberts criticized the administration's decision, saying he didn't understand why Obama "doesn't have the courage of his convictions" and refuse to apply the statute.Deputy Solicitor General Sri Srinivasan said Obama was trying to show respect for Congress by enforcing the law until the high court could rule on its constitutionality.Arguments focused on one section of the 1996 act that states a range of federal benefits and considerations for married couples apply only to heterosexual unions.Kennedy told the advocate defending the law it did promote "uniformity" in federal law, noting that there were 1,100 references to marriage in the federal code, and that the definition of a married person is "intertwined with daily life." Kennedy questioned whether the federal government may impose its view of marriage, which has "always thought to be" the domain of the state.Nine states and the District of Columbia permit same-sex couples to marry.Paul D. Clement, representing Republican House leaders who are defending the law, said Congress wasn't discriminating but keeping hands off experiments by the states on same-sex marriage.The law does not punish states for allowing such unions, but allows the federal government to decide how it chooses to allocate its benefits, he said.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said federal rules that apply to married couples are so enveloping that in states allowing same-sex marriages, married same-sex couples can't get the federal benefits available to heterosexual couples, which creates "a skim milk marriage."In the underlying case, Edith Schlain Windsor, an 84-year-old New Yorker, married her same-sex partner of 40 years, Thea Spyer, in 2007 in Canada. When Spyer died in 2009 of multiple sclerosis, she left her estate to Windsor.As executor of Spyer's estate, Windsor paid approximately $363,000 in federal estate taxes, but filed a refund claim under a federal statute that says "property that passes from a decedent to a surviving spouse may generally pass free of federal estate taxes." The Internal Revenue Service denied the claim on the ground that Windsor is not a "spouse" within the meaning of DOMA Section 3 and thus not a "surviving spouse" within the meaning of the statute.A federal appeals court ruled in her favor.The justices heard arguments Tuesday on California's Proposition 8, a referendum that stripped same-sex couples of the right to marry. California voters approved Proposition 8, the California Marriage Protection Act, in 2008 with slightly more than 52 percent for, nearly 48 percent against but a federal judge declared Prop 8 unconstitutional and a three-judge appeals court panel in San Francisco agreed.

PARIS, Feb. 8 (UPI) -- The deep freeze blamed for hundreds of deaths in Europe so far showed no signs of loosening its grip Wednesday, officials said.The cold has killed more than 300 people, mostly in Eastern Europe, various media have reported. In Ukraine, at least 135 deaths in the past two weeks are blamed on the weather, and Emergency Situations Minister Viktor Balaga said 112 have involved alcohol abuse. At least another 64 have died in Russia, 53 in Poland, 39 in Romania, 15 in Bulgaria, 11 in the Czech Republic and more reported dead elsewhere across the continent, news media have reported. In Turkey, hundreds of rural roads were closed by heavy snow, Today's Zaman said. The Italian news agency ANSA reported there have been at least 40 deaths in Italy with colder temperatures and more snow in the forecast heading into the weekend.In Rome, schools opened Wednesday for the first time in three days after snow, almost unknown in the city, brought the Italian capital to a halt. The frigid temperatures disrupted air and rail travel in France, Radio 24 said. In Britain, the meteorological office warned rain would almost certainly turn the roads icy and then turn to snow.The cold spell has also brought a shortage of natural gas while power usage has hit a record high in much of Europe.Omar Baddour of the United Nations World Meteorological Organization said the deadly cold spell is not expected to begin to moderate until at least next week, The Sophia (Bulgaria) Echo reported.Baddour told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, the "negative arctic oscillation" that has caused the cold conditions in Europe is forecast to shift into a more neutral pattern within two to three weeks."So, based on this indicator, we might expect -- it's not a deterministic forecast -- [but] we might expect the changing of the current cold wave might start easing slowly from next week to the end of the month," the U.N. official said.
