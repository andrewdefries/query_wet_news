GALESBURG, Mich., July 28 (UPI) -- Environmental advocates in Michigan complain lawmakers aren't pushing for regulatory measures meant for a cleaner oil industry in their state.Line 6B of the Lakehead oil pipeline system burst July 26, 2010, near Marshall, Mich. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it estimated more than 23,000 barrels of so-called heavy oil spill into regional waters.Beth Wallace, a regional outreach coordinator for the National Wildlife Federation's Great Lakes Regional Center, said there was "a long way to go" to restore the Kalamazoo River more than a year after the spill.Line 6B carried oil from tar sands in Canada. While some of the compounds evaporated or naturally degraded, environmental groups note heavy oil from Canada usually sinks, complicating cleanup efforts."Pipelines were not built or regulated for tar sands oil," Wallace was quoted by the Battle Creek Enquirer as saying.Enbridge has worked for most of the year with crews from the Environmental Protection Agency. U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, in March claimed the EPA is made up of "unelected bureaucrats" who are throwing up "roadblocks to domestic energy production."He recently threw his support behind the Keystone XL pipeline, a planned pipeline for heavy Canadian crude.U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., told the Enquirer, however, that he was "concerned" about pipeline safety in his state.

| License Photo	CINCINNATI, Oct. 30 (UPI) -- British-born rocker Peter Frampton says someone keeps stealing the Barack Obama signs off his lawn in the largely Republican Cincinnati suburb of Indian Hill."They are frustrating my attempt to use my First Amendment right to speech and political speech is supposedly the most protected," Frampton, a naturalized U.S. citizen, told the Cincinnati Enquirer. "It bugs me that people are breaking the law because it bugs them so much. ... I put up some more signs, and they are still there today, but I don't hold out much hope. ... The reason I became a citizen is because I wanted to be able to vote and be part of being an American." Frampton said that calling The Enquirer to discuss the sign-snatching problem marked the first time he has ever reached out to the media and asked to be interviewed. He also warned that he has installed video surveillance equipment in his yard to catch whoever is messing with his message."You won't see it, but it's there," he said of the camera system. "The more they steal my signs, the more I have to donate to my candidate to get more signs. There is an anti-productive thing to their cause."

WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 (UPI) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Kadcyla, a new drug for patients with HER2-positive, late-stage or metastatic breast cancer.Dr. Richard Pazdur of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research said HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell growth and found in increased amounts on some types of cancer cells. Kadcyla -- ado-trastuzumab emtansine -- is intended for patients previously treated with trastuzumab, another anti-HER2 therapy, and taxanes, a class of chemotherapy drugs commonly used for the treatment of breast cancer."Kadcyla is trastuzumab connected to a drug called DM1 that interferes with cancer cell growth," Pazdur said in a statement. "Kadcyla delivers the drug to the cancer site to shrink the tumor, slow disease progression and prolong survival."A clinical study of 991 patients were randomly assigned to receive Kadcyla or lapatinib plus capecitabine, another chemotherapy drug.The trial showed patients treated with Kadcyla had a median progression-free survival -- time cancer did not progress -- of 9.6 months compared to 6.4 months in patients treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine. The median overall survival was 30.9 months in the Kadcyla group and 25.1 months in the lapatinib plus capecitabine group, the trial found. The drug will have an estimated monthly cost of $9,800, or about $94,000 for a full course of treatments, Forbes magazine reported.

SASKATOON, Saskatchewan, May 7 (UPI) -- The University of Saskatchewan says it seeks a buyer for its 300 sheep, which must head to a new pasture due to budget cuts, but won't break up the herd.The university, with a strong reputation in agricultural sciences, keeps the sheep year-round on its campus farm, but has cut 40 jobs and will leave 10 positions unfilled to help close a projected budget shortfall of $44.5 million in 2016, the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail reported Tuesday.Mary Buhr, dean of the school's College of Agriculture and Bioresources, said in a statement that sheep will still be purchased for research purposes but the flock has to go in a move aimed at "minimizing the maintenance that comes with a permanent sheep flock residing on the campus farm."The sheep will graduate and enter the world outside academia together, the newspaper noted. The school is looking for a single buyer for the entire flock.

CHICAGO, April 23 (UPI) -- Asdrubal Cabrera rallied Cleveland with a two-run single in the eighth inning Monday and the Indians went on to record a 3-2 win over the Chicago White Sox.Trailing 2-1 in the eighth, the Tribe began a comeback with one out when Drew Stubbs collected an infield single against Matt Thornton (0-1) and stole second base.Michael Brantley then drew a walk and both runners advanced when Thornton threw wildly to first on a pick-off attempt.After Jason Kipnes fanned for the second out, Cabrera delivered in the clutch, lining Thornton's first pitch into center field for a two-run base hit.The rally made a winner of Justin Masterson (4-1), who overcame four walks en route to the victory. The right-hander yielded two runs on four hits while striking out five.Vinnie Pestano tossed a scoreless eighth and Chris Perez notched his third save as the Tribe claimed the opener of a three-game series.Conor Gillaspie went 2-for-3 with a solo homer for the White Sox.

WASHINGTON, July 27 (UPI) -- U.S. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., Sunday defended presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama from recent political attacks.Hagel said during an appearance on CBS's "Face the Nation" that U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the likely GOP nominee, was pushing the ethical envelope by questioning the Illinois senator's motivations for opposing the Iraq war."I think John is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives, when we start to get into, 'You're less patriotic than me' and 'I'm more patriotic.' I admire and respect John McCain; we talk often. John's better than that," Hagel said.Hagel also criticized a new McCain campaign advertisement that makes it appear Obama spends more time at the gym than with wounded U.S. troops stationed overseas.The advertisement also appears to suggest Obama canceled a visit such troops when he was in Germancy once he learned it would not be broadcast."He certainly would have been criticized, if, on a political trip, to go and be accused of using our wounded troops as props for his campaign," Hagel said on the CBS news program. "I think it would have been totally inappropriate of him, on a trip financed by campaign funds, to go into a military hospital. Based on what I know; he did the right thing."

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Sept. 11 (UPI) -- Americans at home and abroad paused Tuesday to commemorate the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.In New York, the sound of bagpipes filled the 9/11 Memorial plaza in preparation for New York's 11th commemoration.The ceremony consisted of the reading of the nearly 3,000 names of those who died in the terrorist attacks on the towers, musical interludes and moments of silence. Govs. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Chris Christie of New Jersey, and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg were among the dignitaries attending, The New York Times said.New York firefighter Gerard Chipura, whose firefighter brother, John, died on Sept. 11, told WNYC-TV, New York, he was worried people would stop commemorating the day after last year's 10th anniversary."It's heart-wrenching," Chipura said, "but you try to live every day the way your loved one would want you to live."On the South Lawn at the White House, President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and White House staff observed a moment of silence.U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama observe a moment of silence to mark the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, on September 11, 2012. UPI/Olier Douliery/PoolLicense photo | PermalinkAt 8:46 a.m., about the time American Airlines Flight 11 struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York 11 years ago, a full Marine color guard emerged from the doors and flanked each side of an aisle that Obama and his wife walked as three bells tolled.At the commemoration ceremony at the Pentagon, Obama said, "Even now, all these years later, it is easy for those of us who lived through that day to close our eyes and to find ourselves back there -- and back here -- back when grief crashed over us like an awful wave."Eleven times the anniversary has been marked and Americans "have paused in remembrance, in reflection, in unity and in purpose," he said."But no matter how many years pass, no matter how many times we come together on this hallowed ground, know this -- that you will never be alone," Obama said.Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said those who would attack the United States "unleashed our greatest strengths -- the spirit and will to fight back."En route back to the White House, the president and first lady stopped at Arlington National Cemetery to visit the graves in Section 60, one of the sections where those killed in Afghanistan and Iraq are buried. They placed a "challenge coin" -- a medallion bearing insignia given out by commanders to motivate troops -- on one of the first graves they passed and spoke for several minutes.Vice President Joe Biden traveled to Shanksville, Pa., where Flight 93 crashed after passengers and crew overwhelmed hijackers and brought the plane down.Biden said it was "important that this memorial be preserved and go on for our children and our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren, and our great-great-grandchildren -- because it is what makes it so exceptional.""I also hope it continues to give you some solace knowing that this nation, all these people gathered here today, who are not family members, all your neighbors, that they've not forgotten," he said. "They've not forgotten the heroism of your husbands, wives, sons, daughters, mothers, fathers. And that what they did for this country is still etched in the minds of not only you, but millions of Americans, forever."Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said "evil descended upon our country" 11 years ago."America will never forget those who perished. America will never stop caring for the loved ones they left behind," he said in a statement."On this most somber day, those who would attack us should know that we are united, one nation under God, in our determination to stop them and to stand tall for peace and freedom at home and across the world."GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan recalled seeing the smoke rising from the Pentagon 11 years ago."For me, this is a day to remember those who perished on that day of terror, including the first responders," Ryan said in a statement. "It is also a day to pay tribute to all those who have worked quietly and tirelessly both on the home front and abroad to prevent a repetition of such terrible events. And it is a day to give honor to those in our military who have sacrificed so much, including their lives, for the same end."Congressional leaders planned to gather at the East Front steps at the Capitol, the same place members gathered on Sept. 11, 2001, to sing "God Bless America," Roll Call said.At the U.S. naval air facility in Atsugi, Japan, a group of Japanese firefighters and American service personnel honored the victims of the attacks, Stars and Stripes said.Firefighters, base emergency medical technicians and security personnel climbed 110 flights of stairs, the same number as in the New York City towers. Each firefighter wore a full uniform, complete with helmet and self-contained breathing apparatus, to create conditions similar to those New York Fire Department personnel would have experienced on Sept. 11, 2001, Stars and Stripes said.A woman who others with her said was honoring Thomas Tong who died in the attacks weeps on the South Pool wall of the 9/11 Memorial during observances held on the eleventh anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center, at the site in New York, September 11, 2012. UPI/Craig Ruttle/PoolLicense photo | PermalinkTom Kean and Lee Hamilton, former co-chairmen of the 9/11 Commission who now lead the Bipartisan Policy Center's Homeland Security Project, commended efforts at all levels of government to strengthen institutions that protect the country.But, Kean and Hamilton said in a statement, several key areas of the commission's report still haven't been implemented, such as an interoperable, broadband network for first responders."As the years pass the danger exists that we will lose focus, divert attention to other concerns," they said. "But the threat of terrorism persists and our enemies continue to devise new ways to harm us. ... We owe it to the American people to keep our attention riveted on ensuring we are taking every step to keep the country secure."

FORT WORTH, Texas, Dec. 23 (UPI) -- A Texas man said he wants to end life support for his pregnant wife, but state law puts the rights of their 18-week-old fetus above the desires of the mother.Marlise Munoz, 33, became brain dead Nov. 26 when she collapsed from a suspected pulmonary embolism, ABC News reported Monday.Her husband, Erick Munoz, a paramedic, found her on the living room floor of their Tarrant County, Texas, home, and performed CPR before an ambulance arrived."They don't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen," Erick Munoz said. "But I'm aware what challenges I might face ahead."Erick Munoz said he and his wife, who was also a paramedic, had decided they didn't want to be kept alive by machines before Marlise Munoz fell ill. He said he wants to end her life support."It's hard to reach the point where you wish your wife's body would stop," he told WFAA-TV, Dallas.Texas law, though, puts the rights of the fetus first."A person may not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient," the law says.Erick Munoz would have to get a judge to grant an injunction or restraining order in order to end the woman's life support, ABC News said.

NAIROBI, Kenya, March 9 (UPI) -- Kenyan Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta Saturday was named the winner of Kenya's presidential election, election officials said.Kenyatta, who is facing charges of crimes against humanity, took 50.07 percent of the vote, narrowly avoiding a round of runoff elections, The Washington Post reported.His main rival, Prime Minister Raila Odinga, took 43.28 percent of the vote.Before the results of the election were announced, officials from Odinga's Orange Democrat Movement party said that if Kenyatta is named the winner, they will file a legal challenge of the results, the BBC reported."The level of the failures in the system makes it very difficult to believe it was a credible result, and if Uhuru is declared president, Raila will go to court," Salim Lone, one of Odinga's aides, told the Daily Nation newspaper."We are going to court," said Millie Odhiambo, an ODM parliament member. "You concede only when there is a credible process. But this was not a credible process."Kenyans voted on Monday in the country's first presidential since 2007, when accusations of vote-rigging led to violent ethnic clashes in which more than 1,100 people died. Kenyatta has been accused by the International Criminal Court of inciting some of the violence.If Kenyatta's win is upheld, tensions could arise between Kenya and the United States and some European countries, The Washington Post said.Officials in Washington and other countries have warned that there could be consequences if Kenya is led by someone indicted by the ICC.

Sept. 26 (UPI) -- Daryl Hannah made a name for herself as the star of major Hollywood films like "Splash," "Wall Street" and "Steel Magnolias," and now she's notorious for her public demonstrations of environmental advocacy. But in a recent interview with People, the 52-year-old opened up about her childhood autism diagnosis and the hardship she experienced as a result of the disorder.“I’ve never been comfortable being the center of attention,” Hannah said, describing the "debilitating shyness" and insecurity she felt about her diagnosis. She also said she refused to do public appearances in those early years, “not because I was above it, but because I was terrified.”Now living in Los Angeles with her boyfriend and an rescue pig, Hannah said she has learned how deal with the disorder. “I’m a grown up now. I’ve learned a couple of things that really would’ve made my life easier if I’d known them 20 years ago," she said. Hannah's interview with People hits stands Friday.
