WASHINGTON, July 17 (UPI) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke affirmed Wednesday that current monetary policies would remain in place "for the foreseeable future."Bernanke rattled equity markets in mid-June by commenting the central bank, depending on economic conditions, could taper off its $85 billion per month quantitative easing program, possibly ending the program in 2014.On Wednesday, in a semiannual presentation before the House Committee on Financial Services, Bernanke said in prepared remarks that unemployment was still too high "and declining only gradually." In addition, "with inflation running below the [Open Market] Committee's longer-run objective, a highly accommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for the foreseeable future."Bernanke said a recovery in the housing market was contributing to the recovery, but conditions in the labor market were still recovering gradually. While pulling back on the message that monetary policy could change soon, Bernanke noted the central bank's Open Market Committee predicted economic gains would accelerate in the next two years."Most participants saw real gross domestic product growth beginning to step up during the second half of the year, eventually reaching a pace between 2.9 percent and 3.6 percent in 2015," he said.The Fed's policy makers also projected the unemployment rate would decline to between 5.8 percent and 6.2 percent by the end of 2015.But for now the quantitative easing program would remain intact, he said. "We are using asset purchases and the resulting expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet primarily to increase the near-term momentum of the economy, with the specific goal of achieving a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability," he said. "We have made some progress toward this goal, and, with inflation subdued, we intend to continue our purchases until a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook has been realized," the Fed's chairman added.

BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 1 (UPI) -- As compromises go, Argentina is buying used French Mirage jets from Spain rather than pour scarce cash into an ambitious but more desirable acquisition of new aircraft.It's money that Argentina cannot spare, with mounting energy bills that eat up its export earnings, high inflation and slow growth. The Latin American country's military doesn't have an immediate need to rearm itself, despite frequent rhetoric aimed at Britain over the Falkland Islands, but the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is under pressure from the military to modernize the inventory somewhat.The 16 Mirage F-1 jets Argentina will buy from Spain have served the Spanish air force for about 22 years. They'll replace Argentine air force's almost obsolete Mirage III fleet.Fernandez was under mounting pressure from her military aides as neighbor Brazil contemplated buying new generation fighter planes. But the acquisition program in that country is on hold, as Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff fights to reverse slowing growth.In Argentina the greater surprise is the deal itself. Last year, Argentina angered Spain after seizing control of Spanish major Repsol's majority stake in national oil company YPF. Madrid's various intercessions with Fernandez got to a point where King Juan Carlos was hauled in as an intermediary, to no avail.Repsol's claims of $10 billion compensation for YPF seizure are still under discussion. Most analysts agree that Argentina will have neither the cash nor the inclination to compensate. But Spain, itself under huge economic strain in the eurozone's continuing crisis, is anxious not to burn bridges with Argentina, however troublesome its government may be.The details of the Mirage deal were not discussed. Officials would only say the purchase was worth about $230 million. That spending is likely to appear as an expenditure in Argentina's budget next year. Exactly how the purchase will be funded and how the payment will be made remains unclear.Argentina has hinted on and off that it wants to decommission its own Mirage III fleet. It's not clear how many are still flying. Argentina is known to have an assortment of more than 25 Mirage III jets, a few bought from Israel and Peru.Analysts said the Mirage deal was of greater benefit to Spain, which would have had difficulty selling off its old jets. For Argentina, the purchase serves another purpose: of assuaging negative Spanish sentiment over Repsol YPF seizure. Spanish diplomats have gone to great lengths to temper Repsol's occasional outbursts on its loss of YPF. Spain doesn't want to let go of Argentina, one of its former colonies in Latin America and a major springboard for peddling influence in Latin America.Argentine officials said the Mirages will be refurbished before they are handed over by Spain. A number of avionics and weaponry features were added to the jets before they were formally decommissioned in June, but analysts say those changes too may need further revisions.Features added to the Mirage-1 jets include airborne refueling capacity, laser-guided autonomous navigation and improved targeting gadgetry.The Mirage family was one of the more successful fighter bombers produced by Dassault Aviation of France, which is struggling to market its new Rafale jet fighter. Brazil is among countries approached by Dassault as a Rafale potential buyer. The new jet is well beyond Argentina's reach at present, both financially and in terms of air force human resources, while Fernandez grapples with severe economic problems and constraints on spending of foreign exchange earned through commodity exports.

LAS VEGAS, Oct. 28 (UPI) -- Illusionist Criss Angel says he will suspend his "Believe" show in Las Vegas for three months in 2014 to have surgery on damaged tendons in a shoulder.He said the pain had been "intense" after tearing two tendons a year ago, the Las Vegas Sun reported Sunday.Doctors had wanted him to undergo surgery at that time, but Angel said he was already committed to filming a series for Spike TV and performing at the Luxor."There is no alternative" now, he said, after tearing the tendons a second time while hanging upside down in a strait jacket in Times Square."It's three times as bad now," Angel added. "I have to go under the knife. There is no other choice. I've already put it off far too long.""Otherwise, it means permanent damage, and I wouldn't be able to ever perform again," he said.Angel said the surgery will be performed in January and he will host a show featuring other magicians in February and March. He expects to be performing again in April.

ISTANBUL, Turkey, Nov. 29 (UPI) -- A Turkish plastic surgeon says he's keeping busy performing mustache implants on men wanting to project virility, wisdom and maturity.Dr. Selahattin Tulunay told CNN he's doing 50 to 60 of the procedures each month, using a technique called follicular unit extraction in which clumps of hair are transplanted from other parts of the body under local anesthetic. Most of his patients are medical tourists from the Middle East between the ages of 30 and 50 who pay about $7,000 each, the U.S. broadcaster reported Thursday."For some men who look young and junior, they think [a mustache] is a must to look senior ... more professional and wise," he said. "They think it is prestigious."Saudi Arabian journalist Andrew Hammond says the mustache has deep roots in Arab culture."Having a mustache was always a big thing, ever since the Ottoman time," he said. "Most Arab leaders have mustaches or some form of facial hair. I think culturally it suggests masculinity, wisdom and experience."Christa Salamandra, an associate professor of anthropology at City University of New York, says the mustache conveys "high social status" in the Arab world where men have even used them as collateral for loans and have had them shaved off as punishment.

ATLANTA, Jan. 16 (UPI) -- Dany Heatley is on the verge of playing again for the Atlanta Thrashers.He moved another step closer Friday when he joined his teammates for a morning skate. He has not played this season.Heatley, 22, resumed skating on Dec. 23, his first on-ice workout since the September car accident that claimed the life of teammate Dan Snyder. He has been recovering from torn ligaments in his right knee suffered in the Sept. 29 accident, when he slammed his Ferrari into a pillar on a winding road in Atlanta's Buckhead section.""This is just another step in the process," said General Manager Don Waddell. "He continues to make great progress and today we just thought we would throw him out there with a few more players on the ice."Snyder was a passenger in Heatley's car and died of massive brain injuries six days later at the age of 25.The Thrashers were preparing for Friday night's home game against Carolina.

| License Photo	AUGUSTA, Ga., April 13 (UPI) -- Angel Cabrera and Brandt Snedeker each fired a round of 3-under-par 69 Saturday, forging a two-way tie for the lead after 54 holes of the 77th Masters.Cabrera, the 2009 Masters champion, will seek his third overall PGA Tour title while Snedeker, who won at Pebble Beach this year, is looking for his eighth tour win.The pair finished at 7-under-par 209, one shot clear of Australia's Adam Scott, who also recorded a 69 Saturday at Augusta National. Second-rounder leader Jason Day ran into trouble down the stretch, bogeying the last two holes to end with an 1-over 73, finishing in a three-way tie for third at minus-5.Joining him there was fellow Aussie Marc Leishman, who carded an even-par 72.With three Australians in the top five, the nation is hoping for one of its own to win the Masters for the first time. Holding sole possession of sixth place one shot further back was Matt Kuchar (69).Tiger Woods, hit with a 2-stroke penalty before his round, registered a 2-under 70 to fall into a seventh-place tie with Tim Clark (67). Had he not been penalized, Woods would have joined Day and Leishman in fifth.Fourteen-year-old Guan Tianlang, the youngest player ever at the Masters, struggled to a 5-over 77 Saturday, finishing in 59th place at 9-over 225.

WASHINGTON, March 20 (UPI) -- The U.S. Senate voted 94-2 Tuesday to strip U.S. President George Bush of the power to bypass the confirmation process for U.S. attorneys.Only two Republicans, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Christopher Bond of Missouri, opposed the measure, The New York Times reported. The overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate suggests that the bill is likely to pass the U.S. House of Representatives by a veto-proof margin.The Justice Department has said it will not oppose the bill, which removes a provision in the USA Patriot Act allowing the president to name U.S. attorneys without confirmation. It would restore the old system, which allowed the attorney general to fill vacancies with interim appointees for up to 120 days.The Patriot Act bypass received little notice until the flap about the dismissal of eight U.S. attorneys. The Justice Department claims that thousands of e-mail messages turned over to Congress late Monday show that the eight were fired for performance reasons, not politics, CNN reported."The department did not remove the U.S. attorneys for improper reasons, such as to prevent or retaliate for a particular prosecution in a public corruption matter," Justice Department spokeswoman Tasia Scolinos said.But House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., said the pile of paper delivered Monday night won't stop his committee from investigating the matter."This investigation has uncovered serious charges of misleading Congress, obstructing justice and abuse of power," he told CNN. "We are prepared to press ahead to get to the bottom of this growing scandal, using subpoenas if necessary."

| License Photo	DENVER, Sept. 19 (UPI) -- Miami Heat forward Chris Andersen's attorney said his client was the victim of a hoax that led authorities to raid his Denver home on a pornography warrant. The perpetrator of the hoax was a Canadian woman Andersen never met, attorney Mark Bryant told ABC News. "What we are led to believe is this person assumed Mr. Andersen's identity via Internet sources and was using that for profit, relationships and gifts," Bryant said.Canadian police said they had mounted an investigation with the Colorado sheriff's office, and charged one woman, but declined to say whether Andersen was a victim.Shelly Lynn Chartier, 29, was arrested in January and charged with the possession and transmitting child pornography, impersonation, extortion and making threats. Lisa Pinto, a spokeswoman for the 18th Judicial District in Colorado, said prosecutors are not planning to charge Andersen. "Of course, he is glad his name is being restored. He knew it from the beginning," Bryant said. In May 2012, detectives raided Andersen's home after receiving a tip. Authorities seized Andersen's computer and sent it to an FBI laboratory.

LONDON, July 26 (UPI) -- Mitt Romney came in for stern criticism for suggesting Thursday London is not ready for the Olympics but said the day "has been marvelous for us."In an interview with NBC, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee suggested London might be "unprepared" for the games, which start Friday. A senior British government source said officials were stunned, The Guardian reported."What a total shocker," the source told the newspaper. "We are speechless."London Mayor Boris Johnson, a Conservative, was far from speechless, calling out Romney by name as he spoke to a crowd estimated at 60,000 as the Olympic torch arrived in Hyde Park."I hear there's a guy called Mitt Romney who wants to know whether we're ready," Johnson said. "He wants to know whether we're ready. Are we ready? Are we ready? Yes, we are."Prime Minister David Cameron responded initially with a joke about the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, which Romney managed: "We are holding an Olympic Games in one of the busiest, most active, bustling cities anywhere in the world. Of course it's easier if you hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere."The joke prompted a rebuke from Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker, whose office said in a statement to BuzzFeed: "While those of us who have had the fortune of visiting London know it is certainly a wonderful city, Prime Minister Cameron's comments likely reflect his lack of familiarity with Salt Lake City."He can stop by any time. We'd love to have him and are happy to send a map so he doesn't run into any trouble locating the middle of nowhere."After spending 45 minutes with the prime minister at No. 10 Downing Street, Romney said he expected the games to be "highly successful."President Barack Obama (L) and Prime Minister David Cameron watch the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship on March 13, 2012 in Dayton, Ohio. UPI/Brian KerseyLicense photo | PermalinkRomney also met Thursday with former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Labor Party leader Ed Miliband in London. The former Massachusetts governor focused on the Olympics, rather than policy issues, in his meeting, The Washington Post reported."The athletes have arrived, the torch is about to come into London ... My experience is that this event will change the hearts of many, many people," Romney said.Romney raised eyebrows among U.K. political analysts when he told reporters he had met with the head of the MI6 intelligence agency.He finished the day with a fundraiser that brought in an estimated $2 million for his campaign, co-hosted by executives of banks being investigated as part of an interest rate-fixing scandal, the Post said."It has been a marvelous day for us," Romney said.Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economyTwo top Romney campaign surrogates -- Virginia Gov. Bobby Jindal and Virginia Bob McDonnell -- told reporters in a conference call they don't think the candidate's missteps in London will be a problem for his campaign."We're not worried about overseas headlines," Jindal said. "We're worried about voters back here at home in America."Romney aides had said prior to his overseas trip U.S. Republicans were irked with Cameron's embrace of President Barack Obama.Cameron, who visited the White House in March, joined the Democratic president on a visit to a college basketball game in Ohio -- a key swing state in November's presidential election -- and was later honored with a White House state dinner.Cameron declined to meet any Republican leaders during the visit, the Romney advisers -- who requested anonymity -- told the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph.Senior advisers to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee expressed similar criticisms to the British newspaper The Guardian in May, calling Cameron's White House visit a "love-in" with Obama.One of the Romney advisers told the Telegraph Romney considered Britain "our oldest friend in the world," although Romney wrote in his memoir "No Apology": "England is just a small island. Its roads and houses are small. With few exceptions, it doesn't make things that people want to buy."The Republican Party presented a united front with Britain's Conservative Party in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was president and Margaret Thatcher was prime minister. Since then, the political picture has become more complex, with the Labor Party in Britain moving to the right. Blair supported President George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq when few other European leaders did.Cameron's party is more in line with Democrats in several areas. He supports legalizing same-sex marriage and has called his administration the "greenest" in the nation's history.

LONDON, July 9 (UPI) -- U.S. surveillance leaker Edward Snowden a month ago predicted Washington would demonize him and charge him with espionage, a newly released interview indicated.Separately, Snowden was honored by a group of former U.S. national security officers with the Sam Adams Award for revealing the extent of U.S. government domestic and international electronic surveillance."I think they are going to say I have committed grave crimes, I have violated the Espionage Act," Snowden told The Guardian in Hong Kong June 6, before he revealed himself as the source of leaks about National Security Agency surveillance."They are going to say I have aided our enemies in making them aware of these systems. But this argument can be made against anyone who reveals information that points out mass surveillance systems," Snowden said right after The Guardian published the first leak about a court order requiring Verizon Communications Inc. to hand over U.S. customers' call records to the NSA.The computer expert faces two charges under the 1917 U.S. Espionage Act -- unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified intelligence to an unauthorized person -- along with charges of theft of government property.Snowden fled to Moscow June 23 and is reported stuck in the vast transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport's international wing.He has been offered asylum by Venezuela but has not said if he would accept the offer, which he requested.Bolivia and Nicaragua have also said they could give refuge to Snowden.He also faces the practical problem of getting to any of these countries.Cuban President Raul Castro Sunday expressed support for the Latin American offers, which The Washington Post said opened the possibility Snowden could fly through Havana as a first leg on his flight to asylum.In the interview Snowden, 30, said he first joined the U.S. Army after the invasion of Iraq out of a belief in "the goodness of what we were doing. I believed in the nobility of our intentions to free oppressed people overseas."Snowden enlisted in the Army in May 2004 as a Special Forces, or Green Berets, recruit but was discharged four months later after breaking both legs in a training accident.He then joined the NSA as a security guard before joining the CIA to work on information technology security.In later jobs in and related to the NSA and CIA, Snowden became increasingly disenchanted as he saw what he said was government propaganda, rather than government truth, increasingly dominate the news, he told the newspaper."We were actually involved in misleading the public -- and misleading all the publics, not just the American public -- in order to create certain mindset in the global consciousness and I was actually a victim of that," he said in the June 6 interview."America is a fundamentally good country. We have good people with good values who want to do the right thing," he added."But the structures of power that exist are working to their own ends to extend their capability at the expense of all publics," he said.Separately, Snowden was honored with the Sam Adams Award by Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence, a group of former national security officers, for revealing the extent of domestic and international U.S. government surveillance, the group said Monday.Snowden did "an amazingly brave act of civil disobedience," former senior NSA executive Thomas A. Drake said in a statement.Drake, who won the Sam Adams Award in 2011, was himself indicted under the Espionage Act in 2010 for exposing through The Baltimore Sun waste and fraud in the NSA's Trailblazer program, intended to develop a capability to analyze Internet and other communications-networks' data.In Drake's case, all 10 original felony charges were dropped in 2011. He agreed to plead guilty to the misdemeanor of "exceeding authorized use of a government computer."Adams, who died in 1988, was a CIA analyst who reported through CBS News the United States purposely underestimated Vietcong and North Vietnamese army troop numbers during the Vietnam War to bolster U.S. claims of "progress" in the war.

Dec. 28 (UPI) -- A Facebook page for Plus Size Modeling features a photo of a Barbie doll with fuller proportions and a triple chin asking followers if toy makers should start making plus size Barbies.The posting asks followers to "like" the image if they think toy companies should make the fuller-figure dolls and to comment if not. Post by Plus Size Modeling.As of midday Saturday, more than 40,000 people had "liked" the image, and more than 5,000 had left comments disagreeing with the idea.Several commenters were outraged over what they said was promoting a morbidly obese lifestyle. "No one is naturally fat for gods sake, that's sending the message to girls that it's ok to look like this and be unhealthy.. How about we stop obsessing about being overweight and teach our children to eat healthy and get out and play," one person said.
Others supported the idea of a more average-looking body shape on the doll."Why not have a realistically proportioned Barbie that promotes healthy diet and exercise?" one commenter asked.
Some commenters supported a plus size Barbie, but still found issue with the image posted on the Facebook page."Sure, but Barbie doesn't need a double chin. You can be 'plus size' w/o the double chin. They could make a 'thick' Barbie," one commenter said.
