CALGARY, Alberta, June 12 (UPI) -- Pipelines were closed and containment measures were deployed in the St. Clair River in Ontario in response to a crude oil release, the Canadian government said.The National Energy Board said it was responding to a release of crude oil near Sarnia, Ontario. The NEB said it wasn't able to determine the volume of the release though absorbent booms were deployed in the river as a precaution.NEB said the spill was situated between two oil terminals in Ontario along a right-of-way for pipelines shared by Plains Midstream Canada, Imperial Oil and Enbridge Pipelines Inc.The NEB said all pipelines associated with the area were closed to prevent an additional release of oil. The agency said an excavation team would be required to determine the source of the leak."There is no immediate safety concern for local residents and precautions are being taken to ensure continued public safety," NEB said Tuesday. "There is no indication that any oil has entered the St. Clair River."NEB said its emergency response personnel were working with the oil companies, first responders and the Ontario Ministry of Environment to address the incident.None of the oil companies involved in the incident published public comments about the release.

WASHINGTON, May 27 (UPI) -- Michael Morse hit the first pitch Mike Adams threw in the bottom of the ninth for a home run Friday, giving the Washington Nationals a 2-1 win over San Diego.The Padres tied it in the top of the ninth on a leadoff homer by Jason Bartlett off Drew Storen, who became the winning pitcher when Morse hit his blast to left-center.Washington halted a five-game losing streak and handed the Padres their sixth setback in seven contests.All three runs came on solo homers. In addition to the two ninth-inning shots, Danny Espinosa hit his seventh of the year in the fifth inning for the Nationals.The starting pitchers produced an excellent duel prior to the late long-ball drama. Washington's John Lannan allowed two hits and struck out five in 7 2/3 innings while San Diego's Clayton Richard surrendered three hits in seven innings.Storen improved to 4-1 and Adams saw his record fall to 2-1 after throwing just one pitch.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 (UPI) -- One of Newton's famous laws -- that every action has an opposite and equal reaction -- is often mirrored in international politics. A key question is how to deal with these opposite reactions.Just when breakthroughs in resolving the most pressing international crises appeared possible if not imminent, the roof fell in.Syria's chemical weapons were being dismantled and destroyed. While the initial nuclear deal signed by Permanent Five Plus One, the European Union and Iran offered at least the promise of curtailing Tehran's ambitions it was a major step forward. Then boom!Ukraine, pressured by Moscow and despite strong majority domestic opposition, turned East, not West, eschewing the opportunity to draw closer to the European Union and the Eastern Partnership.China established a large air defense identification zone over international waters in the East China Sea upping the ante in the long-standing Sino-Japanese rivalry over the sovereignty of the tiny Senkaku/Diaoyu islets. Responding to the severity of the moment, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden was dispatched to Tokyo and Beijing as a mediator to ease the tensions.Meanwhile, Afghan President Hamid Karzai's refusal to sign a Status of Forces Agreement immunizing U.S. and allied troops from Afghan law is an absolute deal breaker if foreign forces are to remain in that country after the 2014 withdrawal date giving rise to the "zero option" in which not a single solider would stay behind.Violence in Iraq continues to spike.Fierce Saudi and Israeli resistance against the Iran nuclear agreement was enflamed by specious rumors about Pakistani nuclear weapons built with Saudi money in case Tehran does develop a bomb. The more preposterous rumor that Israel could transfer nuclear weapons to Saudi hands fortunately hasn't materialized.And Egypt appears to be facing a major insurgency in the Sinai.Drawing lessons from these opposite if not equal reactions is premature. However, a few observations are relevant. From a U.S. and Western perspective, traditional state-versus-state conflicts and tensions cannot be ignored, dismissed or overshadowed by the dangers of failed and failing states and religiously driven acts of terror by non-state actors such as al-Qaida or one of its affiliates, and individuals.Second, institutions such as the United Nations and NATO are impotent in dealing with many crises and in this case, the Sino-Japanese confrontation or convincing Karzai that without foreign support and assistance, Afghanistan won't survive for long as a coherent state.Third, multi-crises exceed the capability of any government, let alone the United States', to deal concurrently and effectively with each of them. U.S. foreign policy seems to be defined by where Secretary of State John Kerry is at any given moment. Riveted on the Iran nuclear deal, the White House dispatched national security adviser Susan Rice to Kabul instead of Kerry, in essence sending in the reserves.Similarly, while Biden is highly credible as well as vice president, one wonders that if Kerry weren't preoccupied elsewhere, which official would have made the trip to China and Japan.Further, even if the U.S. government had the capacity for multi-crises responses -- U.S. President Barack Obama's preoccupation with resurrecting his major legacy and singular legislative triumph, the Affordable Health Act, and helping Democrats win the 2014 congressional elections limits his attention -- what policies or actions could resolve these crises and who will develop them?The national security organization never was and is not designed to handle multi-crises. Compounding these limitations, each of the major departments is already overloaded with responsibilities.Defense faces massive cuts. Scandals from corrupt companies to sexual abuses demand valuable executive time when many senior positions are vacant. Finding a permanent replacement for the job of deputy secretary is still a work in progress. The intelligence community is still reeling from the National Security Agency/Edward Snowden revelations. And the State Department suffers from the same tyranny of time and limited executive attention.There is an organizational answer: delegate authority and responsibility. Two possibilities could accomplish that.First, within each embassy, establish a contingency cell created for these circumstances. The limitation is obvious. Resources would only allow this to done for selected posts and probably relatively few.The other is to realign the staffs of the combatant military regional commanders along the lines of mini-National Security Councils with fuller senior representation from appropriate agencies. The limitations are also clear. No White House wants to defer or delegate responsibility beyond its control and few ambassadors will wish to feel subordinate to a regional boss.But if Newton's law does apply, then the United States must do something to anticipate not merely multi-crises but ones that are both state- and non-state-based. Delegating responsibility, authority and accountability is one of the private sector's best practices.Whether any president has the courage and boldness to apply that knowledge to government and crisis response is another matter.--(Harlan Ullman is chairman of the Killowen Group, which advises leaders of government and business, and senior adviser at Washington's Atlantic Council.)--(United Press International's "Outside View" commentaries are written by outside contributors who specialize in a variety of important issues.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (UPI) -- The United States will send $30 million more in humanitarian aid to victims in the Syrian conflict, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday.That brings the total of U.S. humanitarian assistance to $200 million to help those suffering because of the Assad regime's violence inside Syria and neighboring countries, the U.S. government said in a statement.The statement said the new funds will allow for the immediate purchase of food in local and regional markets for those in need. Food baskets would contain necessities such as rice, beans and cooking oil.In neighboring countries, the statement said, aid would provide food supplies, hot food and food vouchers for families who have fled the violence in Syria.The additional aid would be dispensed through the World Food Program, which is already providing food aid to 1.5 million people in Syria and refugees in neighboring countries. The government's statement said the United States is the largest donor of food aid for those affected by the conflict in Syria through the WFP.The United States "is providing food aid, medical supplies, emergency and basic healthcare, shelter materials, clean water, hygiene education and supplies and other relief supplies -- including blankets and heaters -- to help more than 1 million people inside Syria and the nearly 400,000 refugees in neighboring countries," the statement said.The Syrian Network for Human Rights said it had documented 88 deaths across Syria Saturday, including five children and two women. Forty-five of the deaths were in Damascus and surrounding area. The London group's figures weren't independently verified.Thousands reportedly have been killed during the past year in the civil war.More information on the U.S. government's response to the humanitarian crisis is online at http://www.usaid.gov/crisis/syria.###.

PRINCETON, N.J., Feb. 13 (UPI) -- Alaskans were the happiest with their standard of living in 2013 and West Virginians the least, the Gallup Organization said Thursday. Gallup conducted interviews with at least 500 residents of each state during the year, asking them whether they are satisfied with their standard of living and whether it is going up or down. The index numbers for states are based on the percentage of residents who give positive answers to both questions. Alaska had a score of 53, with North Dakota, Hawaii and the District of Columbia also scoring more than 50. At 22, West Virginia was significantly below the next least satisfied states, Maine at 31 and Rhode Island with 32. Gallup said states with no income tax tend to rank high on satisfaction with the standard of living. Alaskans not only pay no state tax on their earnings but receive payments from oil tax revenues. Satisfaction also tends to be higher in states where employment is on the upswing, Gallup said. That explains North Dakota's high ranking -- and the low one for West Virginia. The standard of living questions are asked during Gallup's Daily Tracking survey. Gallup interviewed 178,068 adults from January through December 2013.

| License Photo	BEIJING, Dec. 17 (UPI) -- China may abolish its decades-old reeducation-through-labor program to safeguard human rights, the state media said.The official Xinhua News Agency reported the standing committee of the National People's Congress, the country's top legislature, next week will consider a motion drawn up by the State Council or Cabinet to get rid of the system called "laojiao," which was instituted in 1957.Laojiao was designed to deal with offenders whose crimes were not severe enough to require a court trial. Instead, the system allows for detention of up to four years without an open trial.Xinhua said the new motion comes following policy decisions made last month relating to rights issues.

Role in information technology
Environmental activism
Albert Arnold "Al" Gore, Jr. (born March 31, 1948) served as the 45th Vice President of the United States from 1993 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. He is currently an author, businessperson, and American environmental activist who starred in the 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, which won an Academy Award in 2007. Gore also wrote the book An Inconvenient Truth: The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About It, which won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in February 2009.
He was involved in American politics for 24 years, serving first in the U.S. House of Representatives (1977–85) and later in the U.S. Senate (1985–93) (representing Tennessee) before becoming vice president. Gore was the Democratic nominee for president in the 2000 presidential election. He won the popular vote by approximately 500,000 votes, but ultimately lost the electoral college to Republican candidate George W. Bush when the legal controversy over the Florida election recount was eventually settled in the U.S. Supreme Court by a 5–4 margin in favor of Bush—the only time in history the Court has determined the outcome of a presidential election.
