BEIJING, Aug. 28 (UPI) -- A new Greenpeace report warns that pollution from new coal-fired plants planned in China's Guangdong province would cause 16,000 premature deaths in the province and adjacent Hong Kong over the next 40 years.The report, issued Tuesday, is based on joint research by Greenpeace and American air pollution expert H. Andrew Gray. It estimates that PM2.5 pollution – dangerous airborne particles measuring 2.5 microns in diameter – from the existing 96 coal-fired plants operating in both Guangdong and Hong Kong caused nearly 3,600 premature deaths as well as 4,000 cases of asthma in children in the Pearl Delta region during 2011.The delta, in Guangdong province, is one of the most densely urbanized regions in the world and one of the main hubs of China's economic growth.Guangdong is China's biggest coal importer. The region has 11 new coal-fired plants under construction, with another 11 planned.Of the predicted 16,000 premature deaths in the next four decades due to pollution from the 22 new facilities, two-thirds would be related to strokes, the report said. The rest would be from lung cancer and heart disease."The cumulative impact of these new power plants on human health is simply shocking," said Zhou Rong, Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner, in a statement. "The Pearl River Delta region should strictly enforce the policy of no more new coal-fired and oil-fired power plants, as announced in 2009.""Simply pushing the construction of power plants to neighboring cities outside the Pearl River Delta Region will not solve this problem. All cities of Guangdong, and Hong Kong, are interdependent in terms of air quality as well as public health," Zhou said.A separate report released in June by the same Greenpeace research team said that about 9,900 people in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region died in 2011 due to pollution from the region's 196 coal-fired power plants and that 70,000 people suffered health problems that year, requiring them to go to the hospital."The only way to eliminate the health impacts associated with coal burning is to set a clear-cut coal reduction target and to jointly develop renewable energy to meet power demands," Zhou said in Tuesday's statement.China, the world's biggest coal consumer, generates about 70 percent of its electricity from coal power and that is expected to double by 2020, indicates research by the China Environmental Forum, an initiative of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars' global sustainability and resilience program.China now has 363 coal plants slated for construction, which will increase the country's coal-fired generating capacity by nearly 75 percent, says a recent World Resources Institute report.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, July 22 (UPI) -- Aerosmith's publicist says the iconic rock band is gearing up to start its "Cocked, Locked and Ready to Rock Tour" in Oakland, Calif.The 18-city U.S. summer tour is to begin Friday, Liz Rosenberg Media said. The group recently completed a string of successful dates in Europe and South America.Aerosmith is scheduled to play their hometown of Boston, along with the J. Geils Band, at a sold-out Fenway Park show Aug. 14."After last summer, we've been looking forward to getting back out there with a vengeance. I can't wait to feel the roar of the American audiences again and give this summer what it needs -- a double dose of Aerosmith!" Steven Tyler said in a statement Thursday.The band's guitarist, Joe Perry, had a motorcycle mishap last week, but added: "Just like the name of the tour, I am 'cocked, locked and ready to rock.' It was a close call. My bike is smashed, but I am OK from head to toe. I want to thank all of the fans for their e-mails and support." "After all the trials and tribulations we've come out into one of the most fun tours in recent memory. We had an amazing time in South America and Europe and now we're ready to bring it home," said band member Tom Hamilton. Sammy Hagar and the Wabos will open 11 of the 16 announced shows.

NEW YORK, Jan. 22 (UPI) -- The New York Police Department said a raid on a suspected drug lab found only a man mixing table salt with baking soda.Police said officers raided a Manhattan co-op Monday on drug manufacturing allegations and discovered a man creating several pounds of a white substance, the New York Post reported Tuesday.Investigators initially suspected the substance to be illegal bath salts, a designer drug, but they soon discovered the 44-year-old man was only mixing table salt with baking soda.Police said the man may have been suffering from a mental illness and was taken to Roosevelt Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. They said he may have believed he was creating bath salts.

MIAMI, Oct. 10 (UPI) -- Rising sea levels are threatening freshwater plants in Florida's Everglades, researchers say, which could spell problems for the plants and animals alike.That's because the freshwater plant communities lining the southern tip of the Florida Peninsula that depend on freshwater flowing south from Lake Okeechobee provide critical habitats to many wildlife species, University of Miami researchers said.As salt water from rising sea levels intrudes it creates large patches of vegetation loss, their study found."Less salt-tolerant plants like the sawgrass, spike rush, and tropical hardwood hammocks are retreating," geography Professor Douglas Fuller said. "At the same time, salt-loving mangroves continue to extend inland."Fuller and co-author Yu Wang, a former master's program student at UM, used satellite imagery from 2001 to 2010 over the southeastern Everglades to identify changes in vegetation patterns, then followed up with field studies to confirm long-term trends of mangrove expansion and sawgrass habitat loss near the shore."I was very surprised at how well the results matched our understanding of long-term trends and field data," Fuller said. "Normally, we don't see such clear patterns."

UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 3 (UPI) -- The United States says it will resist efforts to have control of the Internet transferred to the United Nations.The Internet's technical specifications and domain name system are overseen by several non-profit U.S. organizations that operate separately from government control although they are officially under the remit of the U.S. Department of Commerce.There has been speculation other countries will seek a change in those arrangements this year.In documents filed with the International Telecommunications Union, the U.N. agency responsible for encouraging the development of communications technologies, the Unites States set out its opposition to any changes."The United States is concerned that proposals by some other governments could lead to greater regulatory burdens being placed on the international telecom sector or perhaps even extended to the Internet sector," Terry Kramer, the U.S. ambassador to an upcoming ITU conference set for December in Dubai, said in a statement."The United States also believes that existing multi-stakeholder institutions, incorporating industry and civil society, have functioned effectively and will continue to ensure the health and growth of the Internet and all its benefits," he said.The ITU said any changes to the current setup must have unanimous support and it would block members trying to put any such matter to a vote."We never vote because voting means winners and losers and you can't afford that," ITU Secretary-General Hamadoun Toure told the BBC."Whatever one single country does not accept will not pass."

| License Photo	INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 26 (UPI) -- Following Tuesday’s 118-98 road loss to the Indiana Pacers, Los Angeles Lakers forward Pau Gasol ripped into head coach Mike D'Antoni and called his teammates selfish during a postgame rant.The Lakers are 15 games out of a playoff spot with 25 games left to play and the loss was the team’s 25th in their last 31 games."There's just too many individual actions right now," Gasol told ESPN after the game. "It's really not a good flow and rhythm out there. You get two guys that are just coming in brand new and they're playing a lot of minutes, so, that's going to take some time for the team and the units to kind of understand each other and be on the same page.”The NBA veteran was referencing Kent Bazemore and MarShon Brooks. Both players were acquired from the Golden State Warriors prior to the trade deadline last Thursday and they combined to shoot 12-for-29 against the Pacers."As long as we hustle, then we give ourselves an opportunity. And we got to be unselfish. If we see a teammate open, we have to make sure that guy gets the ball. Otherwise, it's really deflating. It takes a lot of energy away from individuals,” Gasol said. Gasol, 33, was critical of D'Antoni's choice to play a small lineup against the Pacers."If we want to continue to play small, we have to play to that advantage and utilize more quickness," Gasol said. "But if we get outrebounded by 20 rebounds, I don't care who you are and what you do, it's not going to work. You're not going to win."The 13-year player was asked about the possibility of 215-pound Los Angeles forward Wesley Johnson starting against 260-pound Memphis Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph on Wednesday. "Good luck, right?" he said. "You just got to be really active defensively when you're small like that and let's see what happens [Wednesday], if Wes continues to start or if we actually try to match up and utilize our size because we do have guys with size that can do well.”All-Star guard Kobe Bryant has been out since Dec. 17 and it’s possible he won’t play again this year if the team continues to play in this fashion.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 (UPI) -- George W. Bush kicked off his last Christmas season as president of the United States by lighting the national Christmas tree in Washington Thursday."Today we celebrate the 85th anniversary of the National Christmas Tree lighting," Bush said in brief remarks. "In times of calm, and in times of challenge, Americans have gathered for this ceremony. The simple story we remember during the season speaks to every generation."Before the tree lighting, the president, his wife, Laura, and others in the audience heard a musical program featuring singer Jon Secada. The Santa Claus for the day was Stephen Cramer, a member of the U.S. Army Chorus.The president generally has a hectic time during the run-up to Christmas, with thousands of guests attending a series of White House receptions. The Bushes plan to celebrate Christmas at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, with his parents and other members of their extended family, the White House said in a news release.

LANSING, Mich., Nov. 15 (UPI) -- The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals Thursday ruled Michigan's Proposal 2, a ban on affirmative action approved by state voters in 2006, is unconstitutional.The court voted 8-7 to strike down the ban, with the majority finding it violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.Michigan voters approved Proposal 2 -- which was called the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative -- by a vote of 58 percent to 42 percent in 2006.State Attorney General Bill Schuette said he will appeal the ruling, the Detroit Free Press reported.Proposal 2 "embodies the fundamental premise of what America is all about: equal opportunity under the law," Schuette said in a statement."Entrance to our great universities must be based upon merit," the statement said. "We are prepared to take the fight for quality, fairness and the rule of law to the U.S. Supreme Court."Detroit attorney George Washington, who represented the plaintiffs in the court challenge of Proposal 2, called Thursday's ruling "a tremendous victory for students.""It means that thousands of black students and Latino students will have the chance to go to college they never would have had," he said.The U.S. Supreme Court has heard arguments this term on whether to ban the use of affirmative action in admitting students at the University of Texas.

HUNTSVILLE, Texas, Dec. 3 (UPI) -- Jerry Martin, convicted of killing a corrections officer on horseback by plowing a stolen truck into her after an escape, was put to death Tuesday in Texas.The 43-year-old death row inmate was executed just after 6 p.m. at the state prison in Huntsville, KWTX-TV, Waco, reported.Martin had requested no additional appeals be filed on his behalf, clearing the way for his execution, the TV station said.Martin was the 16th person to be executed in Texas in 2013. No other executions are scheduled in the state this year.Martin was serving a 50-year sentence for attempted capital murder when he and a second inmate ran off from a work detail outside a Huntsville-area prison in September 2007.

Feb. 7 (UPI) -- He may look cute, but a kinkajou captured at a home in Wise County, Texas is vicious enough to have earned the nickname "Rat Bastard." According to My FOX 4 in Dallas-Fort Worth, homeowners Ronnie and Donnie Lee found the nocturnal animal squatting above their garage on Sunday. After biting through a local deputy's "puncture-proof "gloves, the ferocious kinkajou was taken to the Wise County animal shelter, where he escaped his cage and terrorized neighboring cats. Wise County Animal Control and North Texas Humane Society are working together to determine the best course of action for the kinkajou's placement, possibly in a local animal sanctuary. According to NBC-DFW, kinkajou's are native to Central and South America, but can sometimes kept as exotic house pets. Paris Hilton's kinkajou, Baby Luv, famously bit her in 2006.
