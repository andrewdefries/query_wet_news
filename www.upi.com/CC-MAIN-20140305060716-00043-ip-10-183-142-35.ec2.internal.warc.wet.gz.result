VIENNA, March 13 (UPI) -- Demand for OPEC crude oil is declining as non-cartel producers in North America continue their growth, the cartel said in its monthly report for March.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, in its March report, said gains from non-OPEC producers were led by the United States."As in the previous year, U.S. oil supply in 2013 is expected to achieve the highest growth among all non-OPEC countries," OPEC said.Adam Sieminski, administrator for the U.S. Energy Information Administration, said trends in the United States meant it was relying less on foreign markets to meet energy demands."Higher U.S. oil production means America will need less imported oil," he said in a statement. "After reaching a record 60 percent of domestic oil demand in 2005, net oil imports next year are forecast to fall to 32 percent of consumption, the lowest level since 1985."OPEC said it expected cartel members would be called on to supply 29.7 million barrels of oil per day in 2013, which is 400,000 bpd less than 2012.Nevertheless, OPEC said the oil boom in the United States, led by shale developments in Texas and North Dakota, is expected to slow in 2013. U.S. oil supply growth is projected by OPEC at 600,000 bpd in 2013, about 40,000 bpd less than last year.

WARSAW, Poland, Nov. 30 (UPI) -- A Polish coffin manufacturer has caused a stir by publishing a calendar featuring nude women posing with the company's products.The company, Lindner coffins, made the calendar as something of a stunt, but the owner, Zbigniew Lindner, insists people shouldn't be offended by images of nude women and coffins, ANI News reported Friday."So much work goes into our coffins [that are] only seen for a few moments at the funeral. We wanted to show a coffin shouldn't be a sacred object -- it's furniture, the last bed you'll ever sleep in," he said.Others, including Catholic Church officials, disagreed and have called for the calendars, which are being sold for charity, to be pulled, the New York Daily News said.In a statement, the Catholic Church in Poland said "human death should be respected and not mixed with sex."

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Nov. 22 (UPI) -- A doctor in Puerto Rico said former lightweight boxing champion Hector "Macho" Camacho had almost no brain activity Thursday after being shot in the face.Dr. Ernesto Torres told reporters the 50-year-old Camacho has been comatose since being shot Tuesday night. The fighter went into cardiac arrest early Wednesday, the Primera Hora newspaper reported from San Juan.Torres said it was up to a neurologist to make an official proclamation of brain death, although he used the term "clinically brain dead" in his media appearance.The doctor said medical staff had spoken to Camacho's mother, Maria Matias, about organ donation.Camacho was shot while sitting in a car with a childhood friend, who was killed in the attack. A bullet entered Camacho's left jaw, severed his brain stem and ended up in his right shoulder, the report said.Police said numerous packets of cocaine were found in the car where the men were shot.

PHILADELPHIA, June 12 (UPI) -- Temple University basketball star Khalif Wyatt has apologized for "very poor judgment" after being charged with engaging in prostitution in Atlantic City.Wyatt, who was also charged with resisting arrest, is to appear Friday in Atlantic City municipal court, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.Wyatt, who was arrested at 1:01 a.m. Sunday, was among 28 people charged as part of a two-day prostitution sting. Undercover female officers posed as prostitutes, Atlantic City police said.Wyatt was arrested after he offered to pay for sex while on the street and fled when he saw a uniformed officer but was caught about 50 yards away, police said.In a statement, Wyatt said: "I apologize to my family, teammates, coaches and Temple University for the embarrassment that I have caused. I was in Atlantic City this past weekend celebrating my 21st birthday with friends and exercised very poor judgment by allowing myself and my friends to be put in a compromising situation. I intend to cooperate with the authorities during their investigation and the legal process."Larry Dougherty, Temple's senior associate athletic director, said in a statement Monday, "We have just become aware of the charges and are still gathering information at this point."Head coach Fran Dunphy did not return a call seeking comment, the Inquirer said.Wyatt, who will be a senior in the coming school year, was named to the all-Atlantic 10 second team after averaging 17.1 points a game last season.He was kept out of the starting lineup three times during the season for disciplinary reasons, the Inquirer said.

| License Photo	CHICAGO, Sept. 30 (UPI) -- McDonald's has issued a statement calling "completely false" media reports the company was considering dropping healthcare coverage for its employees.The reports are "purely speculative and misleading," the statement said.The company and its franchisees "have been a leader in offering a fully insured limited benefit plan to hourly restaurant employees for more than 10 years," the corporate statement said.The Wall Street Journal had reported McDonald's threatened to terminate health benefits for almost 30,000 hourly workers.The newspaper said that trade groups representing restaurants and retailers oppose a requirement in the health-reform law that 80 percent to 85 percent of premiums be spent on benefits, the Chicago-Tribune reported.McDonald's, in a memo to federal officials, said, "it would be economically prohibitive for our carrier to continue offering" the plan unless it got an exemption from the requirement, the Journal report said.McDonald's said in its statement it was not going to drop coverage."Regardless of how the regulations evolve over the next several months, McDonald's is committed to providing competitive pay and benefits, and the strongest employment opportunities possible," it said.The company acknowledged it has spoken with regulators "to better understand the implications of the law and to share our point of view," Steve Russell, senior vice president and chief people officer for McDonald's USA, said in the company's statement."Moving forward, we will continue to have an open dialogue with legislators as well as regulators," he said.

| License Photo	The introduction of U.S. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's budget was deja vu all over again, sort of, but with a twist of balancing the federal budget in 10 years instead of further out.Political observers say his plan won't see the light of day in the Senate, just as the Democratic proposal revealed by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., won't catch any love in the House.The 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee from Wisconsin's budget would cut spending by $5.7 trillion, reduce the top tax rate to 25 percent and balance the budget within 10 years -- contracting federal spending from 22.2 percent of the economy to 19.1 percent by 2023 and making hay on many of the proposals he advanced while on the stump in 2012.The plan is a litany of all the GOP desires: less spending, lower tax rates and a rejection of most of President Obama's health reforms (except for cuts in Medicare spending, which Ryan would use to reduce the deficit).Ryan also took President Obama to task for not submitting a budget on time, again."He has missed his budget deadline four times in five years. His blatant disregard for the law has upended the budget process," Ryan said. "Today, Washington budgets by crisis. This budget restores regular order -- because the people deserve an honest account of our challenges and what's needed to confront them."What remains nearly the same is Ryan's Medicare proposal which would give seniors the option of buying private insurance on an exchange and receiving "premium support" payments -- which opponents have derided as a voucher system. The option would apply to people age 54 and younger, who would see the proposed changes start when they retire in 2024. The Ryan budget wouldn't make changes to Social Security but would require the president and Congress to develop plans to ensure it remains solvent. "By living beyond our means, we're stealing from the next generation. By promising a higher standard of living today, the federal government is guaranteeing a lower standard of living tomorrow," Ryan said in explanation. "Unless we change course, we will have a debt crisis." Ryan's budget would cut $5.7 trillion in spending over the next decade when using one calculation, The Hill said. When using a calculation he devised, which doesn't include savings from a reduction in war and disaster spending, Ryan's budget would reduce spending by $4.6 trillion.The budget would also cut both the top corporate rate of 35 percent and individual tax rate of 39.6 percent to 25 percent as part of an overhaul of the tax code.To the dismay of fiscal conservatives, the Ryan plan includes the $600 billion in new tax revenue raised under the January "fiscal cliff" deal -- he counts the money as budgetary savings. Ryan also counts hundreds of billion in additional revenue being raised based on economic growth projections by Congressional Budget Office."The law is the law. It is not going to change," he said of keeping the tax revenue, adding he wouldn't relitigate the issue.As he did last year, Ryan's budget keeps Obama's spending cuts to Medicare under the Affordable Care Act, even though he ripped Obama while campaigning. Instead of plowing the money back into heathcare, however, Ryan's plan would use the money to reduce the deficit.He also, again, called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which detractors call "Obamacare."While Ryan's budget aims to reduce the deficit, "the math just doesn't add up," the White House said in response, saying both parties are going to have to compromise."Deficit reduction that asks nothing from the wealthiest Americans has serious consequences for the middle class," White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. "By choosing to give the wealthiest Americans a new tax cut, this budget as written will either fail to achieve any meaningful deficit reduction, raise taxes on middle class families by more than $2,000 -- or both."The details on spending and revenue are spare as Ryan defers to the appropriate committees of jurisdiction.Murray's plan, revealed soon after Ryan offered his proposal, is the first budget from Senate Democrats in four years. It includes nearly $1 trillion in new taxes but would not balance the budget.The blueprint unveiled by the Senate Budget Committee chairwoman also would end the sequester -- something Ryan's plan keeps in place -- and would replace those spending cuts with an even mix of tax increases and spending cuts.The budget would dedicate $100 billion to economic stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending and job training, two items Obama called for during his State of the Union.Once the sequester cuts aren't factored in, Murray's budget seems to reduce deficits by about $800 billion by using the CBO's baseline, The Hill said.As Ryan did with his budget, Murray would let appropriators specify the cuts, The Hill said."Our budget reflects the pro-growth, pro-middle-class agenda that the American people went to the polls in support of last election," Murray said. "I am hopeful that the House of Representatives will join us at the bargaining table and we can work together toward the responsible and bipartisan budget deal the American people expect and deserve. "Murray's budget also includes language concerning reconciliation instructions on tax reform, a move that could allow the budget -- which can't be filibustered -- to be the vehicle for a tax reform bill, The Hill said. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., has opposed including the instructions in the budget, saying his tax reform efforts would be constrained.In his document's preface, Ryan acknowledges his blueprint isn't for everyone."We understand that not everyone shares our view. And we respect that difference of opinion. Last year, the American people chose divided government," he said. "So this year, we have to make it work. We offer this budget in recognition of that need -- and in a spirit of good will."

DOHA, Qatar, Dec. 8 (UPI) -- The Kyoto Protocol agreement, aimed at combating global warming, was extended to 2020 Saturday by delegates to a U.N. forum in Qatar.Passage of the agreement by delegates representing nearly 200 countries came after the talks were extended by a day, the BBC reported. Failure to approve the extension would have been considered a major setback in the worldwide effort to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases that cause global warming. The pact, which had been scheduled to expire Dec. 31, only covers developed nations, which produce less than 15 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, the BBC said.Voice of America reported earlier the delegates had been divided over key differences over how to attack the issue of climate change and how to pay for it. Developing nations want the wealthier countries to commit to increasing aid to them to $100 billion annually by 2020. Some countries also were balking at a proposal to raise the target for carbon emission cuts from 34 percent to 42 percent under the extension.The Daily Telegraph of London reported Jeremy Nicholson, director of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said with its economy still struggling Britain could "ill afford" the billions of dollars year tougher emission rules would add to industrial costs."Ultimately it is the taxpayer or consumer who ends up footing the bill and if you end up putting too much of that cost on industry Britain becomes uncompetitive," he said.Benny Peiser, of Lord Lawson's think tank the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said the cost to industry would be passed on to consumers. "The more renewables you build, like wind, the more you need subsidies so it pushes energy bills up. If business has to pay higher bills the costs of products goes up."

March. 14 (UPI) -- Japanese wrestler Skull Reaper A-ji won an Oita city council seat by 2,828 votes last month, but his fellow lawmakers have banned him from meetings for refusing to remove the Mexican "lucha libre" mask that covers his face. Skull Reaper A-ji said he won't take off the mask because it makes him easier to relate to, the Telegraph reported Wednesday. "If I take my mask off, I'm an entirely different person," he said. "I will not take it off."According to The Daily Mail, Skull Reaper A-ji's colleagues said his mask would "offend the decency of the Assembly."Super Reaper A-ji's not the only Japanese politician to don a mask. The Great Sasuke's fellow lawmakers allowed him to wear his mask when he represented Iwate Prefecture in 2003.(Twitter/@skullaji)
