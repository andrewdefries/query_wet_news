BRUSSELS, April 10 (UPI) -- The European Commission said Thursday the economies of Italy and France were struggling with excessive debt and high labor costs.A report released Thursday says the rising labor costs in Italy are hurting the country's competitiveness, as they are rising faster in Italy than in the rest of the eurozone. In addition, banks in Italy have been hampered by high rates of toxic loans, the report says.The New York Times said the report points out Italy's gross domestic product has dropped by 7 percent in the past five years.In France, labor costs are also reducing the country's competitiveness, the report says. International trade has been on the decline in France since 1997."The reduced number of exporting firms, their relatively small size, as well as factors relating to the business environment are also impediments for export performance," the report says."Decisive policy action by member states and at EU level is helping to rebalance the European economy," said Olli Rehn, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, in a statement."It will take some time yet to complete the unwinding of the imbalances that were able to grow unchecked in the decade up to the crisis, and which continue to take a toll on our economies," Rehn said.

Asked to describe John Rawls, his old friend and fellow philosopher, Rogers Albritton said, "My principle sense of Jack is of a man who has an incredibly fine moral sense in his dealings with other human beings. He is not just the author of a great book; he is a very admirable man. He is the best of us."John Rawls's "A Theory of Justice" published in 1971 has been described as a watershed moment in modern political philosophy, restoring it as an important area for philosophical concern. It is also one of the most comprehensive and influential works of modern liberalism. More than 200,000 copies have been sold worldwide, and more than 5,000 books or articles have discussed it. This is especially noteworthy because "A Theory of Justice" is such a serious, theoretical, and dense work. In his books and articles, Rawls keeps famously private about his life except to lavish credit on others for their help and ideas. He refuses most interviews, has only accepted honorary degrees from universities with which he has personal ties (Oxford, Princeton, Harvard), and has long since removed himself from "Who's Who." Rawls's adult life has been almost exclusively devoted to thinking, teaching, and writing about the problems of social justice, cooperation and individual rights.John Bordley Rawls was born in 1921, the second of five sons in a well-to-do and well-respected Baltimore family. He went to Kent prep school in Connecticut and took both his undergraduate and doctoral philosophy degrees from Princeton University, entering as a freshman in 1939.After college and before graduate school, Rawls joined the Army. He served with the 32nd Infantry Division during World War II in New Guinea, and the Philippines in some of the bloodiest fighting of the war and was with the occupation army in Japan.After teaching at Oxford, Cornell and MIT, Rawls settled at Harvard, where he is now James Bryant Conant University Professor Emeritus, living in Lexington, Mass. He has spent time as a visiting scholar at Oxford, Stanford's Institute for advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, the University of Michigan and the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He has received numerous awards for his work, the most recent being the National Humanities Award presented by President Clinton and the Rolf Schock Prize in Philosophy from the Royal Swedish Academy -- both in 1999. Rawls holds civil and political rights at the center of his philosophy. He takes our freedom to choose our own ends to be the distinctive feature of human nature. His opus on justice revived what was a neglected liberal tradition of the rights based social contract. In this work he rejects utilitarianism, which advocates the maximization of the aggregate well-being of a society, as not sufficiently respecting the rights of individuals. In the spirit of Kant, whom he admires greatly, Rawls insists that people ought to be treated as ends, not as means. Rawls also criticizes libertarianism, which advocates that an individual's rights ought never be infringed upon, by arguing that taking rights seriously implies taking social equality seriously. He feels that it is not enough to avoid having civil and political rights infringed, one must have the meaningful use of these rights in a society.Famously, Rawls developed the idea of the "original position," a thought experiment in which people are placed behind what he calls the "veil of ignorance." They are denied all knowledge about everything that makes them who they are: wealth, age, talents, race, religion, skill, sex and any conception of the good life. Rawls believes that what people in this position would choose for their society could be considered the principles of justice. He argues that in this position people would choose a low-risk strategy in which liberties and the highest minimum levels of wealth, opportunity and power are promoted even at the expense of lowering average levels of one or another. Rawls's related idea, the "difference principle," is perhaps his most controversial and often challenged argument. Here he argues that social and economic differences are acceptable only if these differences benefit the least advantaged in society.Throughout Rawls's career he has dedicated himself to writing articles and giving lectures, elaborating his theory of justice and responding to the numerous criticisms raised by others. He is famous not only for illuminating the misunderstandings of his critics but also for being willing to rethink his arguments and incorporate changes.In 1993 he published his second book, "Political Liberalism," which is his most comprehensive response to more than 30 years of critics. When the paperback edition came out in 1996, it contained an important second introduction and included a "Reply to Hagerman," making it, in effect, a second edition of this work. Despite suffering from several strokes, the first in 1995, which affected his ability to work, Rawls completed his "Law of Peoples" in 1998 -- perhaps his most emotionally explicit work. This was published together with "The Idea of Public Reason Revisited" in 1999. Most recently, in 2001, after decades of work, he has published "Justice as Fairness: A Restatement," about which he speaks in our interview. In this short volume, edited by Erin Kelly, he attempts to reformulate and put in compact form his lifelong work on justice. His "Collected Papers," edited by Samuel Freedman, was published in 1999, and his "Lectured on the History of Moral Philosophy," edited by Barbara Herman appeared in 2000. A story still repeated about Rawls among philosophy students in Emerson Hall at Harvard University seems particularly telling. Once, when attending a dissertation defense, Rawls noticed that the sun was shining in the eyes of the candidate. He rose and positioned himself, standing uncomfortably, between the candidate and the sunlight for the rest of the session. Shining through Rawls's work, ideas and life, despite his inclination towards privacy, is the image of a man who cares intensely about justice, social welfare and individual happiness.--(Prepared by The Harvard Review of Philosophy and edited by S. Phineas Upham.)

INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 13 (UPI) -- Indianapolis police said an officer interrupted a newlywed couple having apparent sexual intercourse in the parking lot of a motel.The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said an officer patrolling a Westside area spotted activity in a car parked at the edge of a motel lot just prior to 1 a.m. Wednesday, the Indianapolis Star reported."I observed two people in the car," Officer Brady Ball wrote in his report of the incident. "I observed a woman straddling a man. She was on top of the man and moving up and down on him with both people in the driver's seat."The officer said he turned his spotlight on the couple and saw they were both exposed below the waist when they quickly changed positions."I told them each to put on and pull up their pants," the officer wrote.The report said the man, 20, and woman, 28, said they were newlyweds having a spontaneous sexual romp in the parking lot.The officer "issued them both a summons for indecent exposure, engaging in sexual intercourse in public and appearing in a state of nudity in public," the report said. "They were instructed to either leave the property or get a room. The couple left the property."

{WOMENSENEWS}--As a "white male feminist" (and businessman) -- I know this description of myself sounds strange, but I'm going to try to make a point -- I've been asking myself what would happen if progressives, especially women, used their combined political and economic muscle to bring corporate political donors to heel.What if women lead the charge to make campaign finance reform the next great civil rights fight?Two Supreme Court decisions (Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission and, later, American Tradition Partnership v. State of Montana) and an appellate court decision (SpeechNow v. Federal Election Commission) have fundamentally transformed our political system and our democracy to a degree we've just been able to grasp from the results of this year's elections, when an unprecedented $6 billion was spent on the federal elections: presidential, Senate and House combined. Never has our electoral process been more captive to vast sums of money from a handful of large corporations and wealthy individuals.And for all the scorn rightfully heaped on Citizens United, it's actually the SpeechNow case that's been the most destructive.SpeechNow allows not-for-profit organizations to accept unlimited contributions from individuals for independent expenditures, which birthed (i) "super PACs," which can accept unlimited contributions but must disclose donors and (ii) especially pernicious, tax-exempt -- or 501copyright -- organizations (often referred to as non-disclosing groups or dark money groups), which are not required to disclose the sources of their funding -- especially pernicious. Under the current Supreme Court and Congress, the prospect of putting reasonable curbs on the political contributions of the extremely wealthy seems quixotic at best.Read more at Women's eNewsHowever, I'm convinced that curbing the political spending of corporations -- their disclosed contributions and, especially, their masked contributions through intermediaries and their anonymous contributions through tax-exempt organizations -- needs to turn into a civil rights fight for this time, of the sort in which we engaged in the '60s and '70s. Only this will allow us to see a future where the nation's large corporations are no longer unfairly influencing our federal elections and, in the process, often helping to steal our civil liberties.Attack on RightsNone of the large corporations currently dominating federal elections is, as far as I know, opposed to civil liberties. However, these companies -- of which American Electric Power, Aetna, Prudential Financial, Dow Chemical, Merck, General Electric and the oil companies rank among the nation's most significant political contributors –consistently fund (usually anonymously through an intermediary such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or through one of the new tax-exempt organizations) federal candidates who enable attacks on reproductive rights for women; resist equal rights for gays and lesbians and fair immigration reform; advance regressive tax policies; and/or seek to limit the influence of unions.Remember it was Congressman (and vice president "wannabe") Paul Ryan who believes that the women's health exception in abortion laws is a "loophole big enough to drive a Mack Truck through," and it was Congressman Todd Akin who dismissed the significance of rape as he opposed contraception and abortion. And it's Ryan and Akin and their ilk who've been receiving massive amounts of corporate campaign contributions.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, arguably the largest and most prominent of the so-called intermediaries, earlier this year indicated that it planned to spend as much as $100 million on the 2012 elections. An analysis of campaign spending data from the Center for Responsive Politics by Public Citizen's Chamber Watch and the Main Street Alliance shows that in 29 of 35 Senate and House races where the Chamber contributed money, it was the biggest or second biggest "dark money spender" in the race.There is no "freedom to spend anonymously" in the Constitution; so once we know which companies are dominating political giving, and to whom they're donating, we should take action. Product boycotts, as we used them widely in the 1960s, spring to mind.Representing AmericaCivil rights organizations have so far mainly hung back from campaign finance reform, believing, understandably, that each organization's primary concern is its respective community of interest.However, we are entitled to a government that represents all of America -- women, not just largely white males; people of color; the working class, not just management; and small business owners, not just large corporations -- rather than one that is controlled by the wealthiest individuals and the largest companies. Otherwise, our civil liberties will be recast by those who are little more than prejudicially elected puppets of those who've become the oligarchs of America.If we cannot stop unrestrained spending through legislative action, which seems unlikely, then we need to at least ensure that strong disclosure laws are in place to guarantee transparency and begin the process of re-establishing our electoral rights.We especially have the right to know if we are supporting hate and discrimination when we go buy a light bulb or a gallon of gasoline or a chicken sandwich, and we always have the right to protest and boycott.In the recent elections it was women -- white, African American, Latina and Asian (and pension-recipients and small business owners) -- who essentially reelected President Barack Obama and elected four new pro-choice senators and 20 new female pro-choice representatives.Leading New ChargeNow it should be women (and the progressive "male feminists" who respect and love them) who lead this new charge. A charge which says no more purchasing from anti-women and anti-civil liberties companies, no more turning a blind eye to the harmful social agendas of extremist candidates, no more anti-Planned Parenthood efforts, no more deportation of Mexican mothers whose children were born here, no more "knocking off" Big Bird and no more same-sex-marriage resistance.And while they're at it, women should say to the managers of the nation's pension plans -- public (e.g., CalPERS) and private (e.g., GE) alike -- that it's past time to use their massive shareholdings to force public disclosure of all corporate political contributions and lobbying expenses.They should also press the Securities and Exchange Commission to compel public companies to disclose their direct and indirect political contributions, since they might affect shareholders' decisions to invest.I end with a plea that all civil rights, civil liberties and labor organizations start demanding -- through marches and boycotts -- an end to corporate political contributions that work against a fair and inclusive society. In order to restore balance to our democracy we have no choice -- in terms of our civil rights -- but to march again against hostile companies, refuse again to buy the products of these companies and decline again to invest in them.Read more at Women's eNews

WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 (UPI) -- Even before the "Arab Spring" outbreak, North Africa and the Middle East led the world in religious hostility and restriction of religion, a new report says.The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, a demographic social science survey organization, said that as of mid-2010, before the outbreak of revolutions in the Mideast, the share of countries it regarded as having high or very high restrictions on religion rose from 31 percent at the end of 2009 to 37 percent in mid-2010."The Middle East-North Africa had by far the world's highest levels of social hostilities involving religion," a Pew Forum statement, released Thursday, said.Three-quarters of the world's population now lives in countries with what the Forum considers high restrictions on religion, it said, up from 70 percent a year earlier.It added that the United States moved from its "low" category on religious restrictions to "moderate" due to incidents on the state and local level involving government limits put on wearing certain religious symbols, zoning permits controlling establishment of houses of worship and a spike in religion-related terrorist attacks.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- A Republican U.S. congressman said Sunday that movement on immigration reform is unlikely this winter until a new budget is passed.Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said on ABC's "This Week" that the budget was the top priority issue on Capitol Hill and immigration reform was on the back burner for now."Not until we get a budget done," Cole said. "Literally I think the most important thing right now is to make sure we don't have a government shutdown, to make sure that we deal with the debt ceiling."Cole said a shutdown was unlikely at this point, but he acknowledged a spending plan will require a long process."Around here, we can't walk and chew gum," said Cole. "Let's just chew gum for a little while. And right now, chewing gum is getting a budget deal and making sure that we don't default when the debt ceiling comes around."
