Energi said several wells have been drilled in the area have indicated the presence of oil and natural gas."(The) initial work program will involve evaluation of technical data and the acquisition of new geophysical data," the company said.Jordan relies heavily on imports for its oil and natural gas reserves.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, June 28 (UPI) -- "30 Rock" star Alec Baldwin is to return to Broadway next spring in Lyle Kessler's play "Orphans," producers announced.Directed by Daniel Sullivan, and produced by Frederick Zollo and Robert Cole, this production will mark the first Broadway staging of the play. "I have dreamed, for a long time, of doing this play with this director. It's an honor to work with Dan Sullivan in Lyle Kessler's 'Orphans,'" Baldwin said in a statement Wednesday."In the play, two orphaned brothers are living in a decrepit North Philadelphia row house. Treat, the eldest, supports his damaged younger sibling by petty thievery, and makes the house a virtual prison for the seemingly simple-minded Phillip," a synopsis said. "One night, he kidnaps a rich older man; Harold turns out to have his own motives and becomes the father figure the boys have always yearned for." Baldwin is to play the role of Harold. The roles of Treat and Phillips are yet to be cast. The show will play at a Shubert Theatre to be announced, the producers said. Baldwin's New York stage credits include "Entertaining Mr. Sloane," "Loot," "Prelude to a Kiss," "A Street Car Named Desire," "Macbeth" and "The Twentieth Century." He also appeared in the films "Beetlejuice," "Working Girl," "Miami Blues," "The Hunt for Red October," "Glengarry Glen Ross," "Malice," "The Juror," "The Edge," "Ghosts of Mississippi," "State and Main," "The Cat in the Hat," "The Cooler," "The Aviator," "The Departed" and "It's Complicated."

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 (UPI) -- More than 43,000 people were injured and 41 died last year due to furniture or televisions not anchored in the wall and tipping over, officials say. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission urged parents of young children to anchor and stabilize their televisions, furniture and appliances to prevent tip-over related incidents. The vast majority of the deaths occurred in children ages 9 and younger, but adults and the elderly have also been injured and killed. Often the accidents occur when a child reaches for a toy, TV or game remote, or other desired item and use dressers and tables as climbing devices, but pull the bottom drawer of tall cabinet and press down and the whole piece of furniture can tip over if it is not anchored to the wall, officials said. "We know that low-cost anchoring devices are effective in preventing tip-over incidents," Inez Tenenbaum, head of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said in a statement. "I urge parents to anchor their TVs, furniture and appliances and protect their children. It takes just a few minutes to do and it can save lives."Tenenbaum recommends the following safety measures:-- Anchor furniture to the wall or the floor.-- Place TVs on sturdy, low bases, or anchor the furniture and the TV on top the base, and push the TV as far back on the furniture as possible.-- Keep remote controls, toys, and other items that might attract children off of TV stands or furniture.-- Keep TV and/or cable cords out of reach of children.-- Make sure freestanding kitchen ranges and stoves are installed with anti-tip brackets.-- Supervise children in rooms where these safety tips have not been followed.

ORLANDO, Fla., Aug. 7 (UPI) -- The University of Central Florida was dubbed the least rigorous college in the United States by the Newsweek & The Daily Beast College Rankings 2012.Newsweek said the school was chosen as the least rigorous based on the percent of applicants admitted, median SAT and ACT stores, the student-to-faculty ratio, and a manageability workload score determined by the Web site College Prowler. The magazine said it used the same methods to dub Columbia University as the most rigorous in the nation.The rankings took debt, total cost, financial aid, and future earnings into account to name the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the most affordable school in the United States, with the average $55,270 cost per-year being eventually offset by graduates making a $69,700 median starter salary and a mid-career median salary of $115,000.Connecticut's Sacred Heart University was dubbed the least affordable school, with students paying an average $50,500 and only making a median salary of $69,500 by the middle of their careers.Missouri's Washington University in St. Louis was named the most stressful U.S. college, based on categories including undergraduate enrollment, total cost per year, percentage of students receiving financial aid, the average amount of financial aid, percentage of applicants admitted and a crime ranking.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 (UPI) -- U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan apologized Monday for singling out white mothers who live in the suburbs in a discussion about the Common Core initiative.In a meeting Friday with state education chiefs, Duncan said he found it "fascinating" that opponents of the Common Core initiative include "white suburban moms who -- all of a sudden -- [discovered that] their child isn't as bright as they thought they were, and their school isn't quite as good as they thought they were," CNN reported.Duncan issued a statement Monday saying he used "clumsy phrasing" in the discussion."We have a tendency in our fast-moving world to focus on controversial-sounding soundbites, instead of the complex policy debates that underlie them," he said. "Unfortunately, I recently played into that dynamic. A few days ago, in a discussion with state education chiefs, I used some clumsy phrasing that I regret -- particularly because it distracted from an important conversation about how to better prepare all of America's students for success."Duncan said he singled out one group of parents when his "aim was to say that we need to communicate better to all groups -- especially those that haven't been well reached in this conversation.""I want to encourage a difficult conversation and challenge the underlying assumption that when we talk about the need to improve our nation's schools, we are talking only about poor minority students in inner cities," he said. "This is simply not true. Research demonstrates that as a country, every demographic group has room for improvement."
