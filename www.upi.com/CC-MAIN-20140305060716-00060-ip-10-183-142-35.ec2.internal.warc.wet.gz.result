BAGHDAD, Nov. 9 (UPI) -- Iraq's strategic effort to become the world's leading oil producer has taken some bad knocks, with the defection of Exxon Mobil and other majors to independence-minded Kurdistan, and Wednesday's expulsion of Turkey's state oil outfit from an exploration deal.But Russia seems more than ready to step in and fill the gap in foreign investment that Baghdad needs to rebuild and expand its oil and gas industry on which the country's future depends.China, eager to add Iraq's oil to its ever-widening network of resource acquisitions in Africa and the Middle East, is also knocking on Baghdad's door to take over production deals awarded largely to Western majors in 2009-10.Russia signed a landmark $4.2 billion arms deal with Baghdad in October during a visit to Moscow by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.Russian President Vladimir Putin, driving to restore Moscow's influence in a region where the Soviet Union once held immense sway, pressed Maliki to allow greater Russian energy investment in Iraq.Moscow media report Baghdad is considered inviting Russia's Lukoil and Gazprom Neft to take over Exxon Mobil's majority stake in the giant West Qurna 1 field in the south.The U.S. company effectively relinquished its stake there when it signed up with the semiautonomous Kurds in October 2011 in a direct challenge to Baghdad's authority.The Oil Ministry disclosed Wednesday that Exxon has informed the central government it wants to quit the $50 billion West Qurna 1 project in the south and sell its majority stake."Exxon's desire to pull out ... reflects the oil majors' growing disenchantment with southern Iraq and their contrasting enthusiasm for Kurdistan which has signed a flurry of landmark deals with Western energy giants," the Financial Times observed.Lukoil, Russia's second largest oil producer, is developing West Qurna 2 with Iraq's state-run North Oil Co. Lukoil has a 75 percent share.Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russian natural gas giant Gaprom, recently signed two exploration contracts with the Kurdish Regional Government. Gazprom reportedly told the Oil Ministry it had suspended work with the Kurds but it hasn't confirmed that and may be hedging its bets.On Wednesday, Iraq signed an oil exploration deal with Lukoil and Japan's Inpex covering 2,100 square miles in the southern provinces of Muthana and Dhi Qar. The two agreed to invest $100 million.So far, the Western exodus from southern Iraq, where two-thirds of the country's oil reserves of 143.1 billion barrels and natural gas holdings of 126 trillion cubic feet are located, has largely benefited Asian oil companies.Industry sources estimate that by 2020 Chinese companies will account for 2 million barrels a day of Iraq's production, pegged at 3.1 million bpd in September.Fatih Birol, chief economist of the International Energy Agency, said recently that "a new trade axis is being formed between Baghdad and Beijing."The IEA predicts Iraqi production could hit 8.3 million bpd by 2035.This relationship is part of a shift that is tipping the balance of power in the energy world" away from the United States to China, the Financial Times said.When Exxon defied Baghdad and signed an exploration deal with the Kurds in October 2011, it triggered an exodus of oil majors from southern Iraq to the more liberal regime, and potentially more lucrative contracts, in Erbil, Kurdistan's capital.These included Total of France and Chevron of the United States.Royal Dutch Shell dallied with the Kurds for a while but eventually backed off breaking with Baghdad. It continues to operate in the south along with BP and other majors.However, the disenchantment among the majors who signed fixed-fee, 20-year production agreements with Baghdad underlines how their patience is running thin over inept governance, suffocating bureaucracy and infrastructure delays.These developments have heightened a long-simmering dispute between Kurdistan and Baghdad over control of oil exploration and production. This rift has immense political ramifications because the Kurds have long sought independence.Oil exports from their own enclave would give them the economic basis for statehood that could signal the break-up of the federal state that emerged after the 2003 U.S. invasion.It would also encourage other Iraqi regions unhappy with Baghdad's domination to seek more autonomy.The most prominent is the Shiite-dominated south where most of Iraq's oil reserves lie -- right next to Iran.

| License Photo	South Korea's Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is doubling fines on people convicted of cruelty to animals.The National Assembly last week approved tougher laws that carry a possible one year jail term and a maximum fine of $9,400 (10 million won) for animal abusers. The new law, which had been sought by animal-rights advocates, is effective Jan. 1."We take it as a significant step that animal abusers may soon be punishable by imprisonment," the Korean Society for Animal Freedom told The Korea Herald.The law was enacted following several high-profile animal abuse cases where a dog meat festival in suburban Seoul was canceled last weekend because of pressure from animal-rights activists. In one incident an animal-rights group offered a $940 (1 million won) reward for the arrest of a man who was videotaped beating a dog to death with a piece of wood.In another case, two security guards at a Seoul apartment building were caught beating a cat to death. The cat had survived being pushed from the 13th floor of the building, the newspaper reported.The new law also requires dog owners to register their animals beginning in 2013, to cut the number of lost and abandoned pets.The National Assembly said the tougher stance "represents the people's increasing concerns over ill-treatment of animals."The San Francisco Animal Control and Welfare Commission is drawing fire from some quarters for a proposal requiring "the humane acquisition of pets." The effect of the proposed new law would be to ban nearly all pet sales within city limits -- dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, amphibians and even aquarium goldfish. It's intended to take the profit away from puppy mills and other inhumane animal production operations.San Francisco residents, who would still be able to legally purchase a pet from small breeders, would be encouraged to adopt animals from shelters."Large-scale, commercial breeding operations add millions of animals to the system. These animals are sold for profit, leading to many documented humane issues such as: overcrowded living conditions, lack of socialization, overbreeding, in-breeding, poor veterinary care, and poor quality of food and shelter," a copy of the commission's talking points obtained by National Review Online said.Critics say the law won't work because pets will be readily able available in nearby cities and online."Pet sales will be banned in San Francisco, but in all the cities around it they won't. And you still can get pets from the Internet," John Chan, manager of Pet Central, told the Chicago Sun-Times.Others say the initiative would put a few San Francisco pet stores out of business but would not have any effect nationwide.The Los Angeles Times didn't waste an opportunity to razz the city by the bay, which has recently banned most fast-food Happy Meals and will vote in November on a measure to ban male circumcision."The ban wouldn't affect animals sold for food, so city residents could still buy a live crab to boil in a pot of water for dinner, just not to keep in an aquarium. Live tilapia to grill, no problem, but a splendidly colored Siamese fighting fish for a fishbowl?" the Times asked in an editorial. "This is a foolish proposal, and the Board of Supervisors should ignore it."The Times said San Francisco would do better by mandating spaying and neutering of most dogs and cats to reduce the number of unwanted animals."But San Francisco should reduce animal cruelty by getting rid of the cruelty, not the animals," the Times said.In June, the Los Angeles City Council asked the Department of Animal Services to come up with an ordinance banning sale of factory-bred animals in pet stores as well as commercial breeding of dogs, cats, chickens and rabbits.A pet store in New York's trendy West Village says it won't sell puppies to intoxicated customers. Le Petit Puppy on St. Christopher Street is surrounded by bars and many would-be customers stumble into the store to pick up a pet on impulse. A pedigreed puppy at the shop can cost $1,200 to $3,000."When they come in drunk, we try to impress the responsibility of it (pet ownership)," sales assistant Andrea Crocitto told the New York Daily News. "We get really attracted to the dogs, and we want them to go to a good home, but people feel a connection and say they can't live without that dog."CitiPups, another pet store on the same fashionable street, also won't sell an animal to a drunk customer, the Daily News said.Store staff usually tell the inebriated customer to come back after sobering up.Odds and EndsHigh-tech electronics for dogs and cats have gone beyond the ID microchip. The latest gadget for roaming pets is from Spotlight GPS Pet Locator, a free iPhone app that notifies pet owners when an animal leaves the yard with an e-mail message or a phone alert, and then tracks it.A history of the pet's roaming for a week is available on the Spotlight Web site. The rechargeable device on a pet collar allows one to track a pet's location turn-by-turn in real time and has a bright, switchable LED to make it easier to find the pet in the dark.The cellphone app also is available for Blackberry devices.

June 17 (UPI) -- Nigella Lawson's husband, art dealer and advertising mogul Charles Saatchi, said in a statement today that pictures of him with his hands around the neck of his celebrity chef wife only showed a "playful tiff," and not the "utterly shocking" abuse witnesses described.His statement is the first since photographs were published of the 70-year-old gripping his hand around a tearful Lawson's neck on the terrace of a London restaurant. Public outcry was swift on social media and police were reportedly looking into the encounter.Saatchi released a statement to The Evening Standard, where he was formerly a columnist."About a week ago, we were sitting outside a restaurant having an intense debate about the children, and I held Nigella’s neck repeatedly while attempting to emphasise my point.There was no grip, it was a playful tiff. The pictures are horrific but give a far more drastic and violent impression of what took place. Nigella’s tears were because we both hate arguing, not because she had been hurt."A spokesperson confirmed that Lawson had left the family's home with her children, and has not made any immediate plan to return."We had made up by the time we were home," Saatchi claimed, adding the move was simply due to media attention. "The paparazzi were congregated outside our house after the story broke yesterday morning, so I told Nigella to take the kids off till the dust settled."The couple were wed in September 2003. Lawson was previously married to journalist John Diamond, who died of throat cancer in 2001. Famous for her best-selling cookbooks and BBC TV series, Lawson also stars as a judge on the ABC reality show "The Taste." She has been on tour promoting her latest book, "Nigellissima."

Kim Sang-ki in his New Year's message told his forces: "This year, North Korea may again attempt to test our combat preparedness and willingness to respond."Our aim is clear. We must create battle-ready troops getting fully prepared to fight and win if the enemy provokes us again" while ordering the army to reform its bureaucratic practices and hold "realistic maneuvers to nurture highly disciplined field commanders and soldiers," Yonhap news agency reported Monday.GALLERY: Yeonpyeong Island, South Korea after the shellingEchoing Chief of Staff Gen. Kim's calls for vigilance and preparedness, air force Chief of Staff Gen. Park Jong-heon said, "North Korea's artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island demonstrated that the North could make a provocation in an unpredictable manner at an unpredictable moment."By ensuring the round-the-clock air surveillance and early warning system, we should hone our ability to resolutely retaliate if North Korea provokes us again."

SPRINGFIELD, Ill., March 19 (UPI) -- The Illinois Senate has approved a bill lessening penalties for teens who use computers or cell phones to share nude photos, the sponsor says.Under the measure, students under 18 caught "sexting" would be given juvenile court supervision instead of facing criminal charges, the Chicago Tribune reported Friday. Sen. Ira Silverstein, a Chicago Democrat who sponsored the bill, said its purpose is to educate not punish."Sometimes these kids don't understand what they're doing, make a mistake and it follows them for life," Silverstein said. "So we don't want that in their record."A similar bill passed the Illinois House last week, so legislation calling for lesser penalties is likely to land on the governor's desk.In December, an honor student at Plainfield East High School sent a nude photo of himself to a classmate, who then forwarded it to several friends, prompting a police investigation.

HOLMEL, N.J., Dec. 4 (UPI) -- Marley's Mellow Mood drink sickened several New Jersey middle school students, the school's cafeteria operator said.The beverage, which packaging says is not intended for children, contains ingredients such as valerian root intended to promote relaxation and relieve stress, the product's website says. The Asbury Park (N.J.) Press said Chartwells School Dining Services, the private company that operates the Satz Middle School cafeteria in Holmel, N.J., removed the product and suspended a manager pending an internal investigation into why the product, which Chartwells said is not on the approved list of beverages to be sold, was made available."We sincerely regret that this product was sold and that students had an adverse reaction to it," the statement said. "Chartwells takes great pride and care in partnering with our school communities to provide the best school dining experience possible and we take this situation very seriously."The drink, which features a likeness of the late Jamaican reggae singer-songwriter and musician Bob Marley, who died of cancer in 1981, was created in partnership with his family, the product's website said.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 (UPI) -- The U.S. Senate Wednesday approved a House-passed bill to restore cuts in pensions for younger military retirees that had been part of a bipartisan budget deal.The final vote was 95-3.The budget agreement -- reached by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash. -- sliced the annual cost-of-living adjustment for working-age military retirees under age 62 and with at least 20 years of service by 1 percentage point below the rate of inflation.The bill headed to the White House restores pension levels only for those already in the military. Cost of living increases for new service members will still be held at below the rate of inflation when they retire.Senate Democrats had insisted the cost of restoring full pension raises not be offset with cuts in other spending but the final bill offsets the cost by extending spending cuts in other areas already approved by Congress, Roll Call reported.Ryan said Congress was avoiding difficult budget choices with the vote to restore the pension increases, Roll Call reported.

KADUNA, Nigeria, Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Nearly 3,000 people have died and thousands wounded in at least 30 pipeline accidents in Nigeria in the last 15 years, says a petroleum industry official.Bafred Enjugu, acting managing director of a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp., revealed the numbers during a workshop for company workers, Channel Television reported Wednesday.An October 1998 pipeline fire killed more than 1,000 people in Delta State in the southeastern region of Nigeria, Enjugu said. Since then pipeline disasters have occurred in areas around the port city of Lagos as well as several other states, he said.Nigeria loses billions of dollars each year from environmental and safety violations caused by human negligence, said Dr. Yahaya Ibrahim, a lecturer from the Department of Environmental Science at Kaduna Polytechnic.He called on NNPC management to develop more technical ways of dealing with oil spills at its facilities.Ibrahim added that weak laws and corruption had prevented Nigeria from enforcing international safety standards.Enjugu said the company had recorded few oil spills and other accidents this year because of an increased focus on safety and health.
