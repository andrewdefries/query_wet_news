| License Photo	The prediction of a doubling in the number of motor vehicles on Earth by 2035 would seem to warrant a prescription for birth control.The more than 7 billion people now on the planet get around in fewer than 1 billion motor vehicles and the global population is not expected to double in 23 years.It's that emerging nations -- the world outside North America, Europe, Australia and Japan -- want to live what used to be called a Western lifestyle. Consumerism is now the global lifestyle.The change has been under way for generations. The question is whether it can be expanded in a sustainable manner.A 670-page report on global energy trends by the International Energy Agency points out China, the world's largest auto market and most populous country, went from having four cars per 1,000 people in 2000 to 40 per 1,000 in 2010, MSNBC reported. China has about 60 million vehicles now, but in 23 years the prediction is it will have 400 million -- 310 motor vehicles per 1,000 people -- still less than half the 660 vehicles per 1,000 population currently on U.S. roads, but there are a lot more Chinese (1.3 billion) than Americans and Europeans.In 2025, the report forecasts China will have more cars and trucks than the United States or the European Union. The number of motor vehicles in India is predicted to leap from 14 million passenger cars in 2011 to about 160 million by 2035. Needless to say world demand for oil will skyrocket -- and so could global pollution and climate change -- unless a substantial number of those new vehicles are powered by electricity and alternative fuels.Unfortunately, IEA foresees only 4 percent of those millions of new cars being plug-in and all-electric vehicles and just 3 percent powered by compressed natural gas. About 20 percent will be gas-electric hybrids and the other nearly three-quarters will have gasoline or diesel-burning internal combustion engines.IEA also predicted by 2035 nearly 90 percent of all the oil produced in the Middle East would go to Asia, with China, India and the Mideast accounting for 60 percent of the expected growth in global energy demand.China is expected to build 10 million miles of new paved lanes by 2035 to add to its 28 million miles of paved roads.The agency said because of new technologies the United States will become a net exporter of energy around 2030 and will be close to energy self-sufficiency five years later thanks to advanced oil recovery techniques, shale natural gas and bio-fuel production augmented by increased use of renewables like solar and wind power."No country is an energy 'island,' and the interactions between different fuels, markets and prices are intensifying," the report's executive summary concludes. The report predicts U.S corporate average fuel economy standards which are set to reach 54.5 mpg in 2025 will top 60 mpg by 2035.Mazda teams up with Toyota on a subcompactJapan's Mazda Motor Corp. is joining forces with giant Toyota to build a Toyota-branded subcompact car at a new plant in Mexico.The unnamed subcompact, based on the Mazda2, would be mostly for the North American market, The Detroit News said. The new car would compete with the Honda Fit, Ford Fiesta, Hyundai Accent and Chevrolet Sonic and account for about 25 percent of the annual capacity of the plant's production of 140,000 vehicles a year. Mazda3 Axela compacts and Mazda2 Demio subcompacts would also roll off the assembly line.Toyota's current subcompact entry, the Yaris, is made in Japan, making it subject to currency fluctuations from the strong yen.The Wall Street Journal said Toyota will invest in production equipment and provide some development funds to boost capacity at the plant, which will start producing vehicles in mid-2015.The world's largest automaker has 14 North American assembly and components facilities and makes Camry sedans in Georgetown, Ky., and at a Subaru plant in Indiana."Through the agreement, TMC [Toyota Motor Corp.] aims to strengthen its North American vehicle lineup while Mazda aims to increase production efficiency and contribute to its profitability," the companies said in a statement.Obama thanks UAW Two days after his re-election victory, President Obama called UAW President Bob King to personally thank the autoworkers union for its support."The president expressed how deeply he appreciates the UAW and our membership and expressed 'that we could not have done without the UAW and its membership,'" said King's note to union members obtained by The Ann Arbor (Mich.) News.UAW support was viewed as key in getting white, blue-collar workers to turn out for the president in Ohio where the 2008-09 auto industry bailout saved thousands of good-paying jobs.Republican challenger Mitt Romney had been highly critical of the $85 billion General Motors Co. and $12.5 billion Chrysler Group auto bailouts.Exit polls conducted by CNN on Election Day indicated 59 percent of Ohio voters expressed approval of the federal bailout of the auto companies and that Obama won the majority of those voters.Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury -- which still owns 500 million shares in GM -- lowered its forecast of losses on the bailout to $24.3 billion, down $750 million from its August forecast, The Detroit News reported."As we've said before, we believe the company's made real progress, but we don't think that the market has given the company as much credit as it might," a Treasury statement said of GM.Chrysler finished repaying all of its government-backed loans last year and its bailout cost about $1.3 billion, the News said.GM offers discounts to military vetsGeneral Motors has expanded discounts to new vehicles purchased by recent military veterans. Previously, the company offered a military discount only to active duty service members, reservists, retired service members and their spouses. Newly discharged service members that leave the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and National Guard within a year will qualify for vehicle discounts that range to as much as $3,770 on a Chevrolet Silverado 1500 pickup, the Detroit Free Press said."We wanted to accommodate the large numbers of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan and the impending draw down of service members from all branches, GM's marketing manager for vehicle purchase programs said in a statement.

BALTIMORE, July 14 (UPI) -- Dozens of sets of triplets gathered in Baltimore with their parents for the annual triplet convention.The event, where sets of triplets gather to share stories and bond, kicked off Saturday in downtown Baltimore, The Baltimore Sun reported.Most of those who attend the event are teenagers, but some are infants and some are college-age, the report said."These are the only people who can actually relate to you," said Ahmad Jones, 17, of Silver Spring, Md., who attended the convention with his brothers Malik and Khalil"We don't get to be with other triplets every day, so when it's here, it's special," said Laurel Samosa, 18. Laurel and her sisters Elizabeth and Adrianna all wore the same blue dress on Saturday.Along with a group photo, the triplets attended workshops, such as "1+1=3," which focused on issues that come from having three kids in the same grade at school, and "Cheaper by the Dozen," on buying in bulk.

LONDON, Oct. 7 (UPI) -- The London Fire Brigade is asking the public to use some "common sense" after firefighters assisted a man whose penis was stuck in a toaster.The Fire Brigade said the 1,300 emergency calls involving people stuck or trapped since 2010 included a man with his penis stuck in a toaster, an adult stuck in a child's toy car and 79 people who were unable to free themselves from handcuffs donned for amorous purposes, The Mirror Reported Monday."Some of the incidents our firefighters are called out could be prevented with a little common sense," Third Officer Dave Brown said. "I don't know whether it's the 'Fifty Shades' effect, but the number of incidents involving items like handcuffs seems to have gone up."The calls also included nine men with rings stuck on their privates, four people with their hands stuck in blenders and five people with their hands stuck in paper shredders.

ATLANTA, Oct. 16 (UPI) -- Matt Ryan and Michael Turner keyed a fourth-quarter rally Sunday and Atlanta claimed three interceptions in defeating Carolina 31-17.The Falcons trailed by three points entering the final period, but then scored on three straight possessions to even their record at 3-3. Carolina has lost four times in its first five games despite the often flashy quarterbacking of rookie Cam Newton.Newton, the first NFL quarterback in history to throw five touchdown passes and run for five scores in his first five games, added another rushing TD Sunday and threw for 237 yards.He was intercepted three times; however, two of them came during the fourth quarter.Atlanta tied the game at 17-17 on Matt Bryant's 24-yard field goal just 48 seconds into the final quarter. The Falcons then took over after a punt and Ryan led them 60 yards in 10 plays before he scored on a 1-yard run that gave Atlanta the lead for good.On the second play after the ensuing kickoff, Newton's short pass was intercepted by Corey Peters at the Panthers' 39-yard line. Atlanta then marched to the clinching touchdown, which was scored by Turner on a 2-yard run. Turner also had a 1-yard touchdown blast in the first period.Turner gained 139 yards on 27 carries while Ryan completed 14-of-22 passes for 163 yards. Newton, the first player taken in this year's draft, was good on 21-of-35 throws. He added 50 rushing yards on six carries.

| License Photo	LINZ, Austria, Oct. 8 (UPI) -- Sofia Arvidsson posted a three-set upset in Monday's opening-day play at the Generali Ladies Linz tennis tournament in Austria.Arvidsson defeated fourth-seeded Lucie Safarova 3-6, 6-2, 7-5. Safarova hampered her own game with 12 double faults, which led to her winning just more than 50 percent (51-of-101) of the points on serve.Arvidsson took advantage and ended up with seven breaks, including three each in the second and third sets.Kiki Bertens advanced with a 7-6 (7-3), 1-6, 6-1 decision over Mona Barthel. Barthel had 11 double faults and was good on just 38 percent of her first serves. Bertens won 62 percent of the points on serve because she took all 12 of the points in her three third-set serving games.Lucie Hradecka got past Silvia Soler-Espinosa 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) by winning half the points when receiving serve. That allowed her to pile up five breaks and move to the second round despite losing all three break points she faced.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 (UPI) -- Reclusive Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar was never on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists, an agency spokesman said.The Express Tribune, owned by The New York Times, reported that the FBI removed Omar's name from its list of most-wanted terrorism suspects. Since the report initially surfaced, The Express Tribune removed the story from its Web site.Omar, the Afghan Taliban's key leader since the 1990s, is listed on a separate terrorism database maintained by the U.S. State Department, which put a $10 million bounty in his head.The FBI's list concerns terrorists allegedly linked to attacks inside the United States or those targeting U.S. national interests. An FBI spokesman was quoted by India's Economic Times as saying that factor, and the State Department listing, meant there was "no question of him being removed from our list."Pakistan's Dawn newspaper notes the original story in The Express Tribune used unidentified officials and wasn't backed by reliable sources. The original story, Dawn reported, alleged Washington pulled Omar's name off the list to build stronger ties with the Taliban.Washington has maintained that reaching out to moderates in the Taliban was a part of a long-term peace plan for Afghanistan.Afghan President Hamid Karzai this week reversed course, the BBC reports, by saying he supported a Taliban office in Qatar that would serve as a base for future peace talks.

| License Photo	NEW YORK, Dec. 27 (UPI) -- Log Cabin Republicans took out an ad in Thursday's New York Times saying former Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., should not be nominated as secretary of defense.The group, which represents gay Republicans, cited anti-gay comments Hagel made 14 years ago regarding James Hormel, who was under consideration for a diplomatic post at the time.Hormel, who is openly gay, was nominated by then-President Bill Clinton to be U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg.The ad cites part of a quote from a 1998 Omaha World Herald interview in which Hagel said: "Ambassadorial posts are sensitive. They are representing America. They are representing our lifestyles, our values, our standards. And I think it is an inhibiting factor to be -- openly aggressively gay like Mr. Hormel -- to do a better job.""Chuck Hagel: Wrong on gay rights. Wrong on Iran. Wrong on Israel." the ad says.There has been speculation President Barack Obama plans to nominate Hagel to succeed outgoing Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta.Hagel has come under attack from conservative groups who note his comments as senator regarding a "Jewish lobby" attempting to intimidate U.S. lawmakers on policy toward Israel, as well as from Sen. Joe Lieberman, Ind-Conn., who said he would have "serious questions" about Hagel's position on national security issues, the Washington newspaper The Hill said Thursday.Hagel issued a public apology this month for his comments about Hormel, the newspaper reported.Hormel told The Washington Post last week Hagel's public apology "had the air of being a defensive move on his part" -- something given "only in service of his attempt to get the nomination."

SPRINGFIELD, Mo., Feb. 23 (UPI) -- About 10,000 people turned out Saturday night in Springfield, Mo., for a vigil honoring slain 10-year-old Hailey Owens, a city official said.City spokeswoman Cora Scott estimated the size of the crowd, which marched with candles to remember the youngster, who was allegedly kidnapped and then murdered last week."There are no words to describe our community's broken heart," Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Seifried told the crowd gathered at a footbridge. "There are no words to describe our frustration. The unthinkable has happened in our community."A suspect was arrested last week in the case, but participants in Saturday's vigil agreed not to discuss the arrest or even bring up suspect Craig Wood's name. "Tonight is about Hailey, not the crime," marcher Angel Boeddeker told the Springfield (Mo.) News-Leader.Wood remained in jail without bond this weekend on kidnapping and murder charges.

TOKYO, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- A cooperative is suspending fishing in the waters near Japan's stricken Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant, officials said Thursday. The announcement by the Soma Futaba fisheries cooperative followed the Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s admission that highly contaminated water if leaking into the ocean from the plant, Kyodo News Service reported. The plant was crippled in 2011 by the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami. TEPCO said late Wednesday that radiation levels in groundwater are so high the most likely explanation is that radioactive water from the plant's cooling system is leaking from the reactors into basements and mixing with water from local aquifers,The Japan Times reported. Tests have detected 10 trillion becquerels of radioactive strontium and 20 trillion becquerels of cesium-137 from the groundwater. That's 100 times the levels of radiation allowed in water flowing from the plant before the earthquake, The Mainichi Shimbun reported. The Soma Futaba announcement followed an earlier one from another cooperative that it will not resume fishing.
