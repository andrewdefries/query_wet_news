VILNIUS, Lithuania, Oct. 5 (UPI) -- The Lithuanian government announced plans to file a $1.9 billion lawsuit against Russian gas company Gazprom on charges it was over billed.European countries rely heavily on Russian natural gas. The European Commission last month launched an antitrust investigation against Gazprom's operations in the upstream natural gas sector in Central and Eastern Europe.Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius told Cabinet members the EC decision was of "crucial importance" to the relationship with Gazprom."We have had several talks with the Gazprom management, including the talks that took place in this building, regarding this fact," he said. "We presented clear arguments and tried to convince them to adjust prices prior to any arbitral actions, however, to no avail."Kubilius said the action against Gazprom would be brought to the Stockholm Arbitration Tribunal. He said Gazprom violated the terms of a natural gas pricing agreement, causing prices to escalate considerably since 2004.Gazprom had no immediate reaction to the Lithuanian case. The company said it considered the EC antitrust investigation to be a reflection of a weak European economy.The Russian company, in a statement, said it "scrupulously" meets the letter of the law in all countries where it conducts business.

| License Photo	SEATTLE, June 19 (UPI) -- Seattle-based coffee chain Starbucks said it will label the calories of items on menu boards at U.S. stores next week, ahead of federal regulations."Menu labeling is yet another step to extend our commitment to wellness, ensuring our customers and partners -- employees -- have the information they need to make informed decisions and understand all the ways that they can customize their Starbucks beverages to be within their desired calorie range," Mary Wagner, senior vice president of Global Research & Development at Starbucks, said in a statement.Starbucks will post calorie counts to accompany each beverage listed on the menu boards, as well as on tags to accompany food in the bakery case. Each beverage is listed as a standard recipe, though each is fully customizable, such as ordering without whip, choosing a different milk or sugar-free syrup option, Wagner said. Menu board labeling and pastry case calorie labeling will complement nutritional information already provided to customers via printed brochures, a nutrition tab on Starbucks.com and via the Starbucks Mobile App for iPhone.In addition to the nutritional information on the Starbucks website, a page provides a list of favorite foods with 350 calories or less at http://www.starbucks.com/menu/nutrition/35-under-350.Ashley Barrient, a clinical dietitian and bariatric specialist at Loyola University Medical Center near Chicago said Starbucks, said: "So often in Loyola's medical weight loss clinic, I witness patients' reactions of disbelief and shock as we review together online the high caloric content of a food item they chose at a restaurant that they thought was healthy."

VATICAN CITY, July 13 (UPI) -- Pope Francis sent his official blessing to an Italian nursery school after exchanging letters with one of its young students.The pope responded to a letter sent to him by a 3-year-old girl from Osio Sopra, who asked him for his blessings upon her family and the nursery school she attends.Alice Maria Rocca wrote the letter with the help of her grandmother and was pleasantly surprised this week when she received a response from Francis that included the requested good words.Alice Maria and the pontiff actually had a bit of a prior relationship, Italy's ANSA news agency said Friday.She had been among a cadre of children who made a pilgrimage to the Vatican -- and was personally greeted by Francis -- in June for the 50th anniversary of the death of Pope John XXIII.

WASHINGTON, April 9 (UPI) -- Just over half of Americans say they believe that capitalism is a better economic system than socialism, a U.S. poll indicates.The Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey found that 53 percent of Americans say capitalism is better, while 20 percent said they believe that socialism is the better system. Twenty-seven percent of respondents said they are not sure which is better.The poll found that adults under 30 are evenly divided on which system is better, while adults over 40 strongly favor capitalism.Republicans, by an 11-to-1 margin, said they favor capitalism. Among Democrats, 39 percent said capitalism is better, while 30 percent said they prefer socialism. The poll's sample size and margin of error were not reported."It is interesting to compare the new results to an earlier survey in which 70 percent of Americans prefer a free-market economy," Rasmussen said in its analysis. "The fact that a 'free-market economy' attracts substantially more support than 'capitalism' may suggest some skepticism about whether capitalism in the United States today relies on free markets."

WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 (UPI) -- Among U.S. President Barack Obama's biggest financial backers are lawyers who specialize in representing whistle-blowers, fundraising disclosures show.The small but powerful group of lawyers have flourished in the wake of financial reforms implemented by the Obama administration. The New York Times reported Monday the government has paid out nearly $1.6 billion in whistle-blower cases from fines levied against offending businesses.In some instances, the law firms representing the whistle-blowers claim up to 40 percent of the award for themselves.The lawyers involved in those cases have raised $3 million for the president's re-election effort, writing checks to Obama's campaign directly, along with a "super PAC" supporting him, the Democratic National Committee and congressional Democrats.Obama's opponent, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a former private equity firm manager, has pledged to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act placing greater regulations on Wall Street. Romney also supports capping the amount of awards for whistle-blowers, pointing to a recent award of $104 million, saying what was once an effort to keep businesses honest has turned into an attempt to win the lottery, the Times reported.

| License Photo	LONDON, Nov. 29 (UPI) -- Reaction around the world was swift, and mostly negative, to the posting of confidential U.S. diplomatic cables by the whistle-blower Web site WikiLeaks.U.S. officials denounced the publication of the leaked documents Sunday, with one senator calling WikiLeaks' action "despicable" and a threat to global security. On Monday, Britain's Foreign Office condemned any release of classified documents, CNN reported. "They can damage national security, are not in the national interest and, as the U.S. (has) said, may put lives at risk," the office said in a statement. The release includes 251,288 cables sent by U.S. diplomats between the end of 1966 and February 2010, WikiLeaks said in a statement announcing the release. WikiLeaks said 8,017 of the cables originated from the secretary of state's office and more than 15,600 are classified as secret, CNN reportedA spokesman for Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari -- who was mentioned in leaked documents with Saudi King Abdallah -- called the leaks "no more than an attempt to create misperceptions between two important and brotherly Muslim countries." Afghan President Hamid Karzai downplayed the significance of the revelations. "The things that have been said about President Karzai are not new. They've been alleged in the media in the past and we are not surprised," a Karzai spokesman said.Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan took a wait-and-see attitude, CNN said."Let's see first what WikiLeaks has at this stage," Erdogan said Monday. "Then we can find out how serious or not serious these are. Because the seriousness of WikiLeaks is suspicious." The New York Times and four European newspapers that received the documents began publishing excerpts Sunday. WikiLeaks has said the documents will be released in stages "over the next few months" to allow readers to digest them.

| License Photo	Aug. 8 (UPI) -- Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh-Jennings have never lost a beach volleyball match in Olympics competition, which is all the more remarkable since they're just one victory away from their third consecutive gold medal. Misty's husband, Matt Treanor, plays baseball for the Los Angeles Dodgers, and so he hasn't been able to come watch his wife and her longtime partner dominate the competition on the sand. So after nearly every match, Misty has looked straight into NBC's cameras and given a shout-out to Matt and his team.Now Matt has made a sweetly supportive video of his own.Your browser does not support iframes.(Here's Misty's "Go Dodgers!")

Wiki
Brendan Joseph Hansen (born August 15, 1981 in Havertown, Pennsylvania) is an American swimmer who specializes in the breaststroke. He is a four-time Olympic medalist and multiple record holder. He attended Haverford Senior High School in Haverford, PA.
Brendan Hansen grew up in Havertown, PA, a suburb about 10 minutes away from Philadelphia. He swam at many different clubs, some including Karakung Swim Club and Lower Merion Aquatic Club. His main strokes are breaststroke and freestyle. Despite setting the world record in the 100 and 200 meter breaststroke at the 2004 U.S. Olympic trials, he did not manage to win a gold medal in either event at the 2004 Summer Olympics, as he settled for silver in the 100 and bronze in the 200. He would win a gold in those games for his role in the world-record setting 4 x 100 medley relay. His split on the relay turned out to be one of the fastest in history.
At the 2005 World Aquatics Championships, Hansen won gold in the same three events that he participated in at the 2004 Olympics.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG

Wiki
Shonda Rhimes (born January 13, 1970) is an American screenwriter, director and producer. She is best known as the creator, head writer, and executive producer of television series Grey's Anatomy and its spin-off Private Practice. In May 2007, she was named one of Time magazine's 100 Time 100 people who help shape the world.
Growing up with her mother (professor), father (university administrator) and five siblings in Park Forest South, Illinois (now University Park), Shonda Rhimes exhibited an early affinity toward storytelling. Rhimes has said that her time spent as a candy striper while in high school sparked an interest in hospital environments.
Rhimes attended Marian Catholic High School, Dartmouth College and earned a bachelor's degree. At Dartmouth she divided her time between fiction and directing and performing in plays. As a Dartmouth alumna, Rhimes often peppers the scripts with references to the college. After college, she relocated to San Francisco with an older sibling and took a job in advertising to pay the bills. But her desire to create overtook her need for financial stability, and she headed for Los Angeles to attend USC to study screenwriting. There, she quickly rose to the top of her class and earned the prestigious Gary Rosenberg Writing Fellowship Award. She earned a master of fine arts from the University of Southern California's School of Cinema-Television.	FULL ARTICLE AT WIKIPEDIA.ORG
