BLOOMINGTON, Ill., Jan. 15 (UPI) -- Only 20 percent of U.S. entrepreneurs indicated they believed the economy would return to pre-recession levels, a recent survey indicated.Compared with government workers and private company workers, entrepreneurs indicated the least amount of confidence in the economic recovery, the survey sponsored by COUNTRY Financial found.In comparison with entrepreneurs, 34 percent of government workers and 30 percent of workers in private firms indicated they believed the pre-recession economy would return.Among entrepreneurs, 56 percent indicated they were confident they could meet their financial goals in the post-recession economy. However, that still came up short next to government workers, 67 percent of whom indicated they were confident of hitting their financial goals, and private company workers, 66 percent of whom expressed their confidence.The survey that included 3,000 respondents was compiled by Rasmussen Reports LLC. The results, it can be said with 95 percent confidence, includes a margin of error of plus and minus 2 percentage points.

LOS ANGELES, July 13 (UPI) -- Syfy's "Sharknado" may have taken social media by storm this week but Nielsen ratings indicate television viewers didn't find the film as much of a sensation."Sharknado," a science-fiction movie about sharks being hurled on land by tornadoes, premiered Thursday night and drew an average of 1.4 million viewers, Nielsen said.That's a decent rating, the Los Angeles Times said Friday, but far from what Syfy's "Swamp Shark" drew in two years ago, with 2.2. million viewers."Swamp Shark," and other similarly themed Syfy films received nowhere near as much social media attention as "Sharknado," though."There are certain things that social media loves," said Sree Sreenivasan, chief digital officer at Columbia University.But "just because someone's writing about you doesn't mean they'll buy your product," he added."Sharknado" drew 387,000 mentions on social media Thursday night -- mostly on Twitter, USA Today reported. Due to popular demand, Syfy said it's scheduling a repeat of the made-for-TV movie Thursday at 7 p.m. EDT.

ANN ARBOR, Mich., Dec. 23 (UPI) -- Smartphones, sometimes seen as a distraction, could be the opposite by helping users stay attentive to achieve goals, a U.S. researcher says.They could act as mentors in mindfulness, University of Michigan engineering Professor Jasprit Singh says."In our culture today, we often don't have scarcity of food or gadgets or knowledge. The scarcity has shifted to mindfulness," Singh said. "We may know we should do something, but we are not always able to do it."Singh challenged students in one of his courses to design mobile apps to help users set and meet wellness milestones, with "wellness" defined as encompassing creativity and learning in addition to physical and mental health.Some examples of student-designed apps were Balance, targeted at senior citizens with easy and routine access to short exercise videos that could improve coordination and prevent falls; WeeAddition, to guide women through pregnancy; and College Granny, aimed at helping students balance studying and socializing."The goal of this course was to bring harmony between what we know and what we do," Singh said in a university release Friday.While humans forget and under stress fail to take intended steps, smartphones don't operate that way, he said."And there are a billion of them in use today worldwide," he said. "They could deliver reminder technologies, or they could observe, teach, anticipate or help users perform best practices on a regular basis.""Technology," Singh said, "can be a great behavior changer."

| License Photo	JERUSALEM, July 2 (UPI) -- Israeli officials are trying to learn why a man plowed a bulldozer into several vehicles in Jerusalem Wednesday, killing three before police killed him.Police are calling the incident a terrorist attack, although officials said they believed Husam Taysir Dwayat, 30, acted alone, The Jerusalem Post reported.Sixty-six others people were injured, officials said. The bulldozer flattened about six cars, and overturned and severely damaged several other vehicles, including a bus.Dwayat -- a Palestinian living in east Jerusalem -- drove down a busy thoroughfare in west Jerusalem, ramming into vehicles before heading toward a market, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN."We believe he acted on his own and tried to kill as many people as possible," Rosenfeld said. The rampage lasted 4-5 minutes before an off-duty police officer shot Dwayat, who cried "Allah Akhbar" (God is great) before he died, the Post said.Police said three terrorist groups claimed responsibility for the attack, including the al-Aksa Martyrs Brigade, affiliated with the Fatah movement in Palestine; the Galilee Freedom Battalion, suspected of being affiliated with Hezbollah; and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a fringe terror group.

| License Photo	WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 (UPI) -- Pentagon and Obama administration officials Wednesday warned automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, are not the way to go to cut the national debt.Deputy Defense Secretary Ash Carter told the House Armed Services Committee $55 billion in defense cuts faced by the Pentagon in fiscal year 2013 if sequestration is not reversed would lead to "an unready, hollow military force."Democrats and Republicans remain deeply divided over how to avoid sequestration, automatic across-the-board deficit-reduction crafted by Congress in the Budget Control Act last August to temporarily resolve a national debt ceiling standoff. House Republicans say the issue could be resolved if Democrats agreed to cut domestic programs.During one exchange, Jeffrey Zients, acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, tangled with Republican committee members over who would be at fault if $110 billion in mandatory spending cuts in defense and domestic programs take effect Jan. 2."The intent of the sequester was to use the threat of mutually disagreeable cuts to both defense and non-defense programs to force Congress to enact a compromise deficit reduction plan," Zients said. "If allowed to occur, sequestration would be destructive to domestic investments, national security and core government operations."The Congressional Budget Office estimates defense spending would be cut about 10 percent and non-defense funding by nearly 8 percent if the sequester is not undone."The root cause of the problem here is the Republican refusal to acknowledge that the top 2 percent have to pay their share," Zients said. He said sequestration "by design is bad policy," and Congress should pass a balanced deficit reduction to avoid it.Republican Ohio Rep. Michael Turner responded by commending Zients "on your broken record of partisanship with respect to your fiction of the fact that this administration has a budget or a plan."Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, R-Calif., said not planning for sequestration would "make a terrible situation worse." "This impasse and lack of a clear way forward has created a chaotic and uncertain budget environment for industry and defense planners," he said.

| License Photo	It's been nearly 50 years since bullets were fired at the presidential motorcade as it wended its way through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, killing U.S. President John F. Kennedy and spawning decades of speculation on whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone or was part of -- or victim of -- a conspiracy with tentacles in Havana, Washington and perhaps Moscow.Did the CIA do it? Was it the mob? The Kremlin? How about a consortium of businessmen?What if Oswald thought he was a double agent working for the CIA who planned to infiltrate Cuba and work for the overthrow of Fidel Castro?Lamar Waldron makes the case Oswald was tangled up in CIA-Mafia machinations against the Castro regime in "The Hidden History of the JFK Assassination."Waldron said it actually was New Orleans mob godfather Carlos Marcello who masterminded the Kennedy assassination -- something Robert Kennedy believed -- but much of the evidence was either destroyed or is still classified because of the CIA's anti-Castro activities.The first investigation into the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination by the Warren Commission, headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, concluded 10 months later in its 889-page report Oswald acted alone, firing three shots at Kennedy from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. The House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978 concluded Kennedy was killed as the result of a conspiracy but ruled out the Soviet Union, Cuba, anti-Castro Cubans and organized crime -- but not individual mobsters -- as complicit.Waldron said Marcello, in a fit of rage during a rant about Kennedy and his brother, Robert, blurted out in the prison yard at the Federal Correctional Institution in Texarkana, Texas, that he had Kennedy killed and wished he could have done it himself. The remark was made in front of two other inmates, one of them Jack Van Laningham, who became his cellmate and eventually wore a wire for the FBI, getting Marcello's alleged confession on tape.Waldron said Marcello, who was incarcerated at Texarkana for his role in the BriLab insurance bribery scheme, hated the Kennedy brothers because of their war on organized crime and their efforts to have him expelled from the United States for good. He was particularly incensed about his deportation to Guatemala -- based on fake documents saying that's where he was born -- and his struggle to slip back into the United States, which took him on a trek through the jungle.Waldron, who reviewed declassified FBI and CIA files and interviewed many of the parties involved, said Marcello's alleged confession is backed by corroborating evidence not available to Laningham or his FBI handlers at the time.Similar confessions came late in life from Marcello's alleged co-conspirators Johnny Rosselli, an underboss for Chicago mobster Sam Giancana, and Santo Trafficante, who controlled the Tampa, Fla., mob and had run casinos in Havana during the heyday of the Batista regime.What makes Waldron so sure Marcello's statements weren't just boasting?"Most mobsters ... haven't ruled unchallenged an empire the size of General Motors for three decades. ... Carlos Marcello ruled Louisiana, Texas and parts of Mississippi. One way Marcello kept that empire so long was by avoiding the limelight, publicity. ... It's a totally different kind of godfather than John Gotti [the New York mobster who headed the Gambino crime family and was known as the 'Dapper Don']," Waldron said, adding because the New Orleans mob was the oldest Mafia organization in the United States, Marcello did not have to go to the national commission to clear hits on government officials.Marcello, he said, actually planned two other attempts on Kennedy in the days preceding Dallas -- one in Chicago and one in Tampa. Like Dallas, two men -- one an ex-Marine and the other a Fair Play for Cuba member -- were positioned to be blamed for the shootings once Kennedy was dead.Waldron said both the Warren Commission and the House select committee investigations were hampered by CIA reluctance to turn over files concerning U.S. efforts to overthrow Castro. Hundreds of thousands of pages related to those plots remain secret despite legislation requiring all files related to the Kennedy assassination be released and Waldron has started a petition on whitehouse.gov (http://wh.gov/lZurV) seeking their declassification.Waldron said it is unlikely Marcello would have left the assassination to Oswald because the former Marine was not an experienced killer. Waldron said Marcello imported two hit men from Europe to handle the shooting."He [Marcello] liked to use war orphans for hits," Waldron said, "because if you killed them afterward, there was no one to ask questions."As for evidence the fatal bullets came from the Texas School Book Depository, "the angle is in huge dispute. It varies by 20 degrees," Waldron said.The Warren Commission said the bullet that injured Connolly, the so-called magic bullet, went in the back of Kennedy's neck and exited just below his Adam's apple. But Waldron said that's false. The bullet actually went in 6 inches below the top of Kennedy's collar -- something Waldron said the late Sen. Arlen Specter, then an investigator for the Warren Commission, changed to make the trajectory line up. Additionally, an exit wound generally is larger than an entrance wound and the hole beneath Kennedy's Adam's apple was smaller than the back wound.Waldron said Kennedy aides riding in the chase car were convinced at least one shot came from the grassy knoll but were pressured to change their stories for national security reasons.History Professor Randy Roberts of Purdue University, who has written about the assassination's effect on American culture, argues conspiracy theories "always sound good" but they don't hold up."It sounds really persuasive but then when you read the documents, they don't really say what you think they say," Roberts said.Roberts, who will appear on the History channel's "Lee Harvey Oswald: 48 Hours to Live" Friday, said the ballistics evidence "is pretty convincing" and he doesn't think Oswald's calling himself "a patsy" means much, considering he was seen carrying a package that investigators said was likely the Mannlicher Carcano rifle (Waldron said the package was too small to be the rifle and never made it to the book depository in any event) used to shoot the president and injure Connolly."If Oswald was a patsy, why did he shoot a policeman and try to shoot more policemen [as he was cornered at a movie theater]?" Roberts asked. "Why did he leave his ring with his wife ... on his way out? ... There's so much logical evidence."Waldron said the evidence implicating Oswald in officer J.D. Tippit's killing is questionable and there are indications Oswald already was inside the movie theater at the time. As for resisting arrest, Waldron said at that point Oswald probably had figured out things weren't going down the way he had been led to believe they would.Best-selling author Robert Tanenbaum, a former New York City prosecutor who served as chief assistant counsel to the House select committee, said he doesn't think the assassination has yet been adequately investigated. He quit the panel when he became convinced members weren't that interested in what really happened."I don't believe Oswald could have been convicted based on the shoddy evidence they had, particularly with all the other evidence," he said, citing, for example, the statements of Dr. Charles Crenshaw, a young doctor who treated Kennedy when he was brought to Parkland Hospital.Crenshaw said one of the bullets entered Kennedy's throat from the front right while a second bullet entered his head from the side "consistent with [a shot fired from the] grassy knoll," Tanenbaum said. But Crenshaw was never even questioned by the Warren Commission and his testimony was ignored by the House committee."I believe without question there were shots that came from the side, the grassy knoll," he said.Roberts doesn't buy it though, especially since there are so many conspiracy theories."If there was a conspiracy, only one of [the theories] can be right. They can't all be," he said.Misconceptions about the assassination still affect U.S. foreign policy. Waldron said the reason the United States never normalized relations with Cuba is because high-ranking officials still are convinced Castro was behind the assassination based on trumped up evidence periodically trotted out by the CIA."[Secretary of State] John Kerry is only the latest government official to say there was a conspiracy, but he pointed a finger at Fidel Castro," he said. "The mob planted a lot of phony evidence pointing to Castro. [Former President Lyndon] Johnson believed Castro killed Kennedy. [Former CIA Director John] McCone believed Castro killed Kennedy. People like [former Secretary of State Alexander] Haig -- they didn't know all of the evidence implicating Fidel was debunked in 1963 and 1964. ... It can all be traced back to the mob."

TEHRAN, July 17 (UPI) -- Iran's foreign minister said Wednesday talks regarding Iran's nuclear program will continue, and a new negotiating team will be formed.Speaking to the Iranian Students News Agency, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said stalled talks with international mediators from six countries – Germany and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the United States, Russia, France, China and Britain -- have gone on for years and will continue. He added Iran will form a new negotiating team after the installation of its new president, Hassan Rouhani.The mediators have made it clear they are willing to resume talks, Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency reported.Tuesday, Baroness Catherine Ashton, European Union High representative for Foreign and Security Policy, said the six countries await the new negotiators from Iran. Western media speculated the continuation of the talks was dependent on the outcome of the election, Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency noted.
