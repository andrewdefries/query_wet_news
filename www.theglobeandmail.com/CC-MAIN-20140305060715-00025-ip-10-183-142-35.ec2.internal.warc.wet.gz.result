Like many Canadians, I’m deeply troubled by the epidemic of prescription painkiller addiction and the rising number of accidental and deliberate deaths attributed to OxyContin. As a doctor who has treated chronic pain, I have insight into how we got here and what we can do about it.
Recently, the news media have been examining the marketing campaign behind OxyContin, focusing on the relationship between Canadian doctors and Purdue Pharma, the drug’s manufacturer. I am among those
mentioned in this coverage.
