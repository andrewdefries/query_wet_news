Quebecor Media Inc. has won a court battle against rival Bell TV over 10-year-old allegations that the latter failed to protect its satellite television signal against piracy in Quebec.The Quebec Superior Court has ordered Bell TV to pay more than $1-million in damages and costs to Quebecor Media units Vidéotron Ltd. and TVA Group Inc. after ruling that Bell TV failed 10 years ago to put in place measures to prevent aspects of the illegal decoding of its satellite signals despite its knowledge of the activities and its ability to put a stop to them.

At the end of our second day in Ireland, my mother and I peeled off sodden socks, slacks and underwear, wrung them out in the bathroom sink, and pitched them in the garbage. Oil stains splattered Mum's white duffle coat and the cuffs of her corduroys. Blue dye from my jacket dripped down the cream cables of my Irish knit sweater. A gritty film of salt licked our faces, our hair and our clothes and creased the corners of our lips. On our third day in Ireland, my salty sneakers stiffened and curled at the toes.
Frannie, my 84-year-old mother, wanted to travel to Ireland. Some of our Irish ancestors left county Sligo for Quebec City in 1825 and some stayed behind in a little stone shack. Frannie wanted to go to Ireland to see that shack. She wanted to go to Ireland for adventure, and she wanted to go with me.
We landed at Shannon Airport, rented a beat-up Toyota, and drove to Glanleam Gardens Guest House, where Meta, the manager asked us if we planned to climb Skellig Michael, a rock face off the coast of County Kerry. She said it was weather-dependent, and she would have to call Seanie.
At half-10 the next morning, we crouched on Sean Murphy's 12-metre fishing boat and crossed from Valentia Bay to Skellig Michael. The boat sailed with four Germans, two Frenchman, two Celts, two Brits, one Scot and two Irish Canadians.
Waves curled over the bow of Seanie's boat and slapped us in the face. My mother hugged her slicker tight to her body and tucked herself into a ball. I pulled the hood of my oilskin over my eyebrows and turned so that the water hit my back. For 45 minutes, Seanie skippered the Seaquest toward two specks of land, 12 kilometres out to sea. For 45 minutes, water splashed down our necks and up our sleeves.
The Seaquest bucked angry swells at Blind Man's Cove and shimmied closer to the only landing spot on the island. Seanie gripped the iron ladder screwed to the 217-metre rock face, and one by one Seanie's mate, Tommy, danced us up three iron rungs to a small plateau of moss and shale. "Back at half-two," he said.
My mother and I followed the two Frenchmen up 600 stone stairs carved by sixth-century monks. "If you get to the top," they told us
en français, "you will receive the monk's blessing." We climbed. Wind whipped around the ragged grey rock and spit seawater at dozens of gannets gathered on stone shelves. "What do you think they meant

The Harper government is blaming privacy fears for a controversial decision to scrap a mandatory long-form census questionnaire - but the country's privacy watchdog has heard almost nothing from Canadians on the topic.
In fact, according to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, only three complaints were laid about any aspect of the census in the last decade: two in 2006 and one in 2001.

"The number of complaints coming to us about the census has dropped in recent years," Privacy Commissioner spokeswoman Anne-Marie Hayden said.
The last time Canadians registered beefs on the census that were measured in the double digits was in 1996 - 14 years ago. And back then, the Privacy Commissioner's office only received 16 complaints. In 1991, the watchdog heard 33 complaints.
The Conservative government has decided it will no longer be mandatory for one-fifth of Canadian households to fill out a so-called long-form census questionnaire.
Opposition parties are marshalling efforts to recall a Commons committee this summer that could probe the decision, one they warn w
