TV crime shows teach us that motive is often the most important piece in solving a mystery. In politics, too, motive is huge.When they hear about a new political proposal, voters rarely start by studying details. Instead, they ponder motive. If they feel good about the motive, they usually go along with a new idea. If they don’t, the details will often be irrelevant.
