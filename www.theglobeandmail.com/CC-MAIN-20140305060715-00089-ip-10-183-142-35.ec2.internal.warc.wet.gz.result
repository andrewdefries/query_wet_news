Title Who Owns the Future?
Author Jaron Lanier
Genre society
Publisher Simon & Schuster
Pages 416
Price $28
I’ll give Lanier one thing: This is the most derangedly ambitious economic proposal I’ve encountered in years. We could use more blue-sky thinking like this, because our debates about the economy have become sclerotic. My hat is off.Unfortunately, the flaws in Lanier’s concept are so numerous I can’t even begin to list them. To pick just one, consider the question of price. If our information gets too expensive, nobody can afford to view anything; too low, and we get no value from it. To avoid this dilemma, Lanier suggests a regulator could “set a principle for tweaking policies” to establish a middle range. He similarly notes that a “central bank of the ‘net” would be needed for the issuing of credit. These would pose a crazily enormous risk of regulatory capture: I can already hear the lobbyists licking their chops.Worse, he never really convinces you that his original conceit is correct – that our personal information is being horribly undervalued. I’d like to believe him; the idea is very pleasing. But he offers no evidence or numbers or models to suggest how much we’d actually make off it. His book is full of or

When Hank Doornekamp's Model 15 White fuel tanker truck was built in 1919, the number of vehicles on the still mainly dirt roads of North America had grown from less than 5,000 at the turn of the century to more than nine million, virtually all of them powered by gasoline.
In the motoring age's early days, the affluent few who could afford cars purchased gasoline from fuel company depots and then in cans or from hand-operated pumps installed by entrepreneurial general store owners.

Dedicated "gas stations" began to appear by about 1910 as oil companies started to create distinct brand identities for their products. Tankers like the White, with its capacity of about 600 or so gallons (2,300 litres) and side compartments to hold motor oil and other products, would have spent their days making deliveries to these newfangled city stations, with their increasingly imaginative, Greek temple, Chinese Pagoda and Swiss chalet themed eye-catching architecture. Or perhaps running rural routes to those mom and pop operations, their limited capacity and speed easily meeting the public consumption needs of the day.
The modern tankers we share highway space with today have the capacity to haul 30,000 litres or more to meet the volume demands of the 20 million vehicles now on Canada's highways and approximately 250 million on U.S. roads, which now consume some 400 million U.S. gallons (1.514-billion litres) of fuel a day - more than a gallon (four litres) for each and every one of us.
While growing up in Oshawa, Doornekamp lived near a White Rose gas station, which obviously struck a chord, as he not only collects White Rose service station memorabilia but his tanker is dressed in the livery of Canadian Oil Companies Ltd. The firm was the Canadian subsidiary of U.S.-based ENARCO (the National Refining Company of Cleveland) whose newly created automotive brands included Black Beauty axle grease and White Rose gasoline.
Born in Holland, Doornekamp came to Canada in the early 1950s with f

Liberal senator Lavigne faces fraud charge

The RCMP laid charges of fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of justice yesterday against Senator Raymond Lavigne, a Chrétien-era patronage appointee who is suspended from the Liberal caucus but continues to receive his salary.
In a statement, the RCMP alleged that Mr. Lavigne misappropriated Senate funds and instructed one of his employees "to carry out tasks unrelated to Senate duties."
"The charges were in connection with Lavigne's alleged use of Senate resources for personal gain," the statement said.
Mr. Lavigne made headlines last year after a Senate committee alleged that he misused nearly $24,000 in Senate funds and sent a staff member to cut down trees with a chainsaw at his Quebec cottage in the Gatineau Hills.
The Senate passed its report into Mr. Lavigne's activities on to the RCMP, which laid the charges yesterday.
A spokeswoman for the Mounties said the charges carry maximum penalties of 14 years in jail.
The obstruction of justice charge stems from Mr. Lavigne's conduct when the Senate started investigating his activities in 2006.
"It is alleged that he asked his employees to make false statements before and after the Senate started its investigation," RCMP Sergeant Monique Beauchamp said.
Mr. Lavigne has recently been on medical leave, but senators asked to hire a doctor to check whether he actually underwent hemorrhoid surgery.
Mr. Lavigne condemned his peers for questioning his right to sick pay.
"Do you think this is a reasonable way to treat a senator. Next time it could be you," Mr. Lavigne said in a letter to senators.
As a result of yesterday's criminal charges, Mr. Lavigne is now on a paid leave of absence from the Senate.
A Liberal spokesman said Mr. Lavigne, who was removed from the Liberal caucus last year, "will remain suspended until the conclusion of the judicial process."
Former prime minister Jean Chrétien named Mr. Lavigne to the Senate in 2002 to make way for former Quebec provincial minister Liza Frulla to enter the House of Commons.
"An energetic and dedicated MP, he has been an effective and persuasive voice for his constituents within caucus and in public," said the press release announcing Mr. Lavigne's appointment five years ago.
Mr. Lavigne, 62, is a former furniture salesman who owned two stores on Montreal Island.
He was first elected to the House in 1993.
According to government sources, the special Senate subcommittee that investigated Mr. Lavigne also alleged last year that he hired a driver on his office budget for purpose

There is no commute, the dress code is casual, and getting lunch is just a matter of walking to the kitchen.
On the flipside, working from home can be isolating, and many people don't have the discipline to be productive with their time.
But as the ranks of the self-employed continue to swell, working from home is gaining a lot of traction for the lifestyle as much as the cost savings.
When Bryan McCaw started WineAlign.com, a service I've done consulting work with and that helps people make better wine-buying decisions at Ontario liquor stores, he was initially embarrassed because he had spent so many years working out of corporate offices. Mr. McCaw, however, had little c

Facebook will begin mixing paid advertising content with users’ updates from friends and family in early 2012, marking a commercial invasion of the social activity that the network has generally held to be sacrosanct.
Normally relegated to the ad column on the right side of the page, advertisers will soon be able to pay their way into the main Facebook news feed, a move that will help companies reach more potential customers and Facebook to generate more revenues ahead of its IPO. However, it might alienate users who have come to rely on the free service to protect their socializing from ads.
