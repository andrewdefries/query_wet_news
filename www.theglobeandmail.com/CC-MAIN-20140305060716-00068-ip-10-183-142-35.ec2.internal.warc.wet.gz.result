The elegant French woman with the smooth manners of a veteran cabinet minister doesn’t conform to common stereotypes of a tough law enforcer. But International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde is pushing for firmer financial regulation around the world.At a news conference in Washington on the eve of the World Economic Forum, the chummy annual gathering of the world’s business elites, Ms. Lagarde decried the “waning commitment” to tighter financial regulations. Finishing the post-2008 effort to fix the world’s banks should be one of three economic priorities in 2013, she said.
