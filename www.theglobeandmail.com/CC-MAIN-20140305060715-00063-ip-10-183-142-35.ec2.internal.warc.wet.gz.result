As the lunar calendar ushered in the Year of the Rabbit, a cartoon video briefly ricocheted around the Chinese Internet. In the opening scene, a small village of rabbits is living happily when a truck selling Three Tiger baby milk pulls up and drops off bottles for all the little bunnies.
But the milk is poisonous - it makes the baby rabbits' heads explode - and soon one mother rabbit is running down to complain at the cave of the tigers (the outgoing lunar year) that rule over them. When she gets inside, the red banner hanging on the cave wall is familiar to anyone who lives in China. "Build a harmonious forest," it reads, in a clear reference to President Hu Jintao's oft-stated goal of establishing a "harmonious society."
