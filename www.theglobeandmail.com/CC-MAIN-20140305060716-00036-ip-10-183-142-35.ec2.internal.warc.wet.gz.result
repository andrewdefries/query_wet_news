Via Rail train plot brings counterterrorism, civil liberties to top of House’s agenda

Public Safety Minister Vic Toews rises in the House of Commons. (ADRIAN WYLD/THE CANADIAN PRESS)
News of a terror plot to attack a Via Rail train, just one week after the Boston Marathon bombings, has pushed public security to the front burner just as the Harper government seeks Parliament’s authority to curb civil liberties in the name of keeping Canadians safe.The House of Commons was several hours into a debate Monday over a government-sponsored counterterrorism bill that would give authorities extra powers of arrest and detention when the RMCP announced they had foiled an al-Qaeda-backed plan to attack a Toronto-area passenger train.

Anybody can carve out a glorious path through victory. But try doing it in the throes of a gutting defeat, when a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is snatched away in a match against your arch-rival on one of your sport’s hallowed grounds, in no small measure because of an incompetent, intimidated official.
