In the early days of the campaign, Barrett received less media coverage than the new boys, David Anderson and Derril Warren. The thirty-three-year old Warren, especially, attracted a media following, with his youthful sincerity and a belief in some quarters that he was the logical choice to inherit W.A.C. Bennett’s legacy as leader of BC’s substantial free enterprise forces. That didn’t bother Barrett much. It was universal political wisdom that the more the non-NDP vote was split, the better it was for the New Democrats. Barrett concentrated on not being a target. By car and a small rented plane, accompanied only by the tireless Harvey Beech, a railway switcher from Coquitlam who was one of his closest friends, Barrett travelled to the far reaches of the province, lapping up the beautiful summer weather. No group was too small to hear his message.

If Maxime Boutin wasn’t familiar to the McMaster Marauders before Friday night’s Vanier Cup game at Rogers Centre they certainly are aware of him now.Not even a starter for the Quebec champions two weeks ago, injuries thrust the Quebec City native into a starting role for the Laval Rouge et Or – and you could say he has ran with it.
