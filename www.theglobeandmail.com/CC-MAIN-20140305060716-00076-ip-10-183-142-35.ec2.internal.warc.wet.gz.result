In the late 1800s, a group of independent oil producers in Pennsylvania came up with a radical idea to foil their nemesis, John D. Rockefeller. The Standard Oil baron had tied up the railroads, stopping his fledgling rivals from getting their oil to market. So, the landlocked independents teamed up to build the world’s first long-distance oil pipeline.

TORONTO, Nov. 6, 2012 /CNW/ - Wajax Corporation ("Wajax" or the
"Corporation") today announced its 2012 third quarter results.
Third Quarter Highlights
Consolidated third quarter revenue of $356.4 million decreased $5.5
million, or 2%, compared to last year as a result of a $22.4 million
reduction in sales in the Power Systems segment largely due to reduced
activity in the western Canada oil and gas sector. Equipment sales
rose 9% on higher revenue in all key product sectors, with particular
strength noted in the construction sector. Industrial Components
revenue increased 1%.
Net earnings for the quarter were $16.2 million, or $0.97 per share,
compared to $17.9 million, or $1.08 per share recorded in 2011. Equipment segment net earnings increased 5% on the higher volumes.
Power Systems segment net earnings declined $3.7 million on the lower
revenue and Industrial Components segment net earnings declined by $0.7
million as an increase in selling and administrative costs more than
outweighed the positive effect of the slightly higher sales.
Consolidated backlog of $202.4 million at September 30, 2012 decreased
17% compared to June 30, 2012, mainly as a result of lower customer
orders in the mining and oil and gas sectors in the Equipment and
Industrial Components segments. Power Systems backlog increased 8% for
the same period.
The Corporation announced that, effective November 2, 2012, Wajax
Equipment became the exclusive Canadian distributor of Bell articulated
dump trucks. These trucks, manufactured by Bell Equipment Limited, are
one of the world&apos;s leading truck lines for construction, quarry and
medium duty resource applications and are sold in 80 countries. Wajax
estimates the annual size of the Canadian market to be at least 500
units, or $225 million. Wajax also estimates the existing Canadian
installed base of trucks manufactured by Bell to be approximately 300
units, which is expected to yield an immediate parts and service
opportunity. The geographic scope and capability of Wajax Equipment&apos;s
Canada-wide distribution network were central factors in securing
distribution rights to this world-class product line.
Effective September 4, 2012, Katie Hunter was appointed Senior Vice
President, Human Resources of Wajax Corporation. Ms. Hunter has held
the position of Vice President, Human Resources at various companies in
the manufacturing, mining and health care sectors and brings extensive
experience in human resource management.
The Corporation declared monthly dividends of $0.27 per share ($3.24
annualized) for the months of November and December, 2012 and January
and February, 2013.
Commenting on the third quarter results and the outlook for the
remainder of 2012, Mark Foote, President and CEO, stated:
"Overall results for the quarter met our expectations. We were very
pleased with the performance of the Equipment division which continued
to grow earnings year-over-year in spite of the loss of the LeTourneau
product support business. We enjoyed higher equipment sales on stronger
construction and material handling markets. Softer economic conditions,
particularly related to the western Canadian oil and gas sector,
negatively impacted profitability in Power Systems and Industrial
Components. Overall backlog declined primarily as a result of a
reduction in customer orders in the mining and oil and gas sectors and
the delivery of the last two LeTourneau mining loaders. While the
number of outstanding quotes for mining equipment continues to be
significant, customers have been delaying their purchasing decisions in
the face of lower commodity prices.
Looking forward we expect softness in the oil and gas and mining sectors
to continue into 2013. This, combined with initial signs of some
slowing in other areas of the Canadian economy leads us to a more
cautious view of near term results. However, we continue to expect that
full year earnings will be modestly higher compared to 2011.
We believe the addition of the Bell truck line will play an important
role in the continued growth of our Equipment division. We remain
confident in our strategy and will continue to invest in our mining
equipment inventory program and our other strategic initiatives to
ensure we are well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities as
customer purchasing decisions accelerate."
Wajax is a leading Canadian distributor and service support provider of
mobile equipment, power systems and industrial components. Reflecting
a diversified exposure to the Canadian economy, its three distinct core
businesses operate through a network of 118 branches across Canada. Its
customer base spans natural resources, construction, transportation,
manufacturing, industrial processing and utilities.

2012 at 2:00 p.m. ET. To access the Webcast, enter www.wajax.com and click on the link for the Webcast on the Investor Relations page.

level and volatility of prices for, commodities, financial market
conditions, including interest rates, the future financial performance
of the Corporation, our costs, market competition, our ability to
attract and retain skilled staff, our ability to procure quality
products and inventory and our ongoing relations with suppliers,
employees and customers. The foregoing list of assumptions is not
exhaustive. Factors that may cause actual results to vary materially
include, but are not limited to, a deterioration in general business
and economic conditions, volatility in the supply and demand for, and
the level of prices for, commodities, fluctuations in financial market
conditions, including interest rates, the level of demand for, and
prices of, the products and services we offer, market acceptance of the
products we offer, termination of distribution or original equipment
manufacturer agreements, unanticipated operational difficulties
(including failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate in
accordance with specifications or expectations, cost escalation,
unavailability of quality products or inventory, supply disruptions,
job action and unanticipated events related to health, safety and
environmental matters), our ability to attract and retain skilled staff
and our ability to maintain our relationships with suppliers, employees
and customers. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. The
forward-looking statements contained in this news release are expressly
qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. The
Corporation does not undertake any obligation to publicly update such
forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent
events or otherwise unless so required by applicable securities laws. Further information concerning the risks and uncertainties associated
with these forward looking statements and the Corporation&apos;s business
may be found in our Annual Information Form for the year ended December
31, 2011, filed on SEDAR.
Management&apos;s Discussion and Analysis - Q3 2012
The following management&apos;s discussion and analysis ("MD&A") discusses
the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Wajax
Corporation ("Wajax" or the "Corporation") for the quarter ended
September 30, 2012. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the
information contained in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements and accompanying notes for the quarter ended September 30,
2012, the annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements and
accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the
associated MD&A. Information contained in this MD&A is based on
information available to management as of November 6, 2012.
Unless otherwise indicated, all financial information within this MD&A
is in millions of dollars, except share and per share data.
Additional information, including Wajax&apos;s Annual Report and Annual
Information Form, are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Responsibility of Management and the Board of Directors
Management is responsible for the information disclosed in this MD&A and
the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and
accompanying notes, and has in place appropriate information systems,
procedures and controls to ensure that information used internally by
management and disclosed externally is materially complete and
reliable. Wajax&apos;s Board of Directors has approved this MD&A and the
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes. In addition, Wajax&apos;s Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board of
Directors, provides an oversight role with respect to all public
financial disclosures made by Wajax, and has reviewed this MD&A and the
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying
notes.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
As at September 30, 2012, Wajax&apos;s management, under the supervision of
its CEO and CFO, had designed disclosure controls and procedures
("DC&P") to provide reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed by Wajax in annual filings, interim filings or other
reports filed or submitted under securities legislation is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the securities legislation. DC&P are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Wajax in annual filings,
interim filings or other reports filed or submitted under securities
legislation is accumulated and communicated to Wajax&apos;s management,
including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.
As at September 30, 2012, Wajax&apos;s management, under the supervision of
its CEO and CFO, had designed internal control over financial reporting
("ICFR") to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards ("IFRS"). In completing the design, management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework. With regard to general controls over information technology,
management also used the set of practices of Control Objectives for
Information and related Technology ("COBIT") created by the IT
Governance Institute.
There was no change in Wajax&apos;s ICFR that occurred during the three
months ended September 30, 2012 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, Wajax&apos;s ICFR.
Wajax Corporation Overview
Wajax&apos;s core distribution businesses are engaged in the sale and
after-sale parts and service support of mobile equipment, power systems
and industrial components through a network of 118 branches across
Canada. Wajax is a multi-line distributor and represents a number of
leading worldwide manufacturers in its core businesses. Its customer
base is diversified, spanning natural resources, construction,
transportation, manufacturing, industrial processing and utilities.
Wajax&apos;s strategy is to continue to grow earnings in all segments through
continuous improvement of operating margins and revenue growth while
maintaining a strong balance sheet. Revenue growth will be achieved
through market share gains, the addition of new or complementary
product lines and aftermarket support services and expansion into new
Canadian geographic territories, either organically or through
acquisitions.
In 2012, the Corporation established an objective of declaring annual
dividends equal to at least 75% of earnings subject to the
Corporation&apos;s financial condition, economic outlook and capital
requirements for growth including acquisitions. The Corporation&apos;s
intention is to continue paying dividends on a monthly basis.

that the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS
requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates may change, having either a negative or positive effect
on net earnings as further information becomes available, and as the
economic environment changes.

Revenue
Revenue in the third quarter of 2012 decreased 2%, or $5.5 million, to
$356.4 million, from $361.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Segment revenue increased 9% in Equipment, decreased 23% in Power
Systems and increased 1% in Industrial Components compared to the same
quarter last year.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, revenue increased 10%, or
$101.2 million, over the same period last year. Excluding revenue from
the former operations of Harper Power Products Inc. ("Harper") acquired
on May 2, 2011, revenue increased 9%, or $84.3 million.
Gross profit
Gross profit in the third quarter of 2012 decreased $3.6 million due to
the decrease in volumes and a lower gross profit margin percentage
compared to the third quarter last year. The gross profit margin
percentage for the quarter of 19.9% declined from 20.6% in the third
quarter of 2011 due mainly to lower equipment margins compared to last
year.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, gross profit increased
$15.1 million due mainly to higher volumes compared to the same period
last year. The gross profit margin percentage decreased to 20.7% in
2012 from 21.3% in 2011 due mainly to a negative sales mix variance
resulting from a higher proportion of equipment sales and lower
equipment margins in Power Systems compared to the same period last
year.
Selling and administrative expenses
Selling and administrative expenses decreased $0.6 million in the third
quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter last year. Decreases
resulting from lower annual incentive accruals were offset in part by
higher personnel and sales related costs. Selling and administrative
expenses as a percentage of revenue remained the same at 13.5% in the
third quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter of 2011.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, selling and administrative
expenses increased $10.1 million compared to the same period last year
due primarily to increased personnel and sales related costs, $3.7
million related to the former Harper operation and a $0.7 million
increase in share-based mid-term incentive accruals. These increases
were partially offset by lower annual incentive accruals and reduced
bad debt expense. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage
of revenue decreased to 14.0% in 2012 from 14.5% in 2011.
Finance costs
Quarterly finance costs of $1.2 million decreased $0.2 million compared
to the same quarter last year. For the nine months ended September 30,
2012, finance costs of $3.1 million decreased $0.4 million compared to
the same period in 2011.
The cost of higher funded debt levels outstanding during the quarter and
for the nine months ending September 30, 2012 were more than offset by
the Corporation&apos;s lower cost of borrowing compared to the same periods
last year. Funded net debt includes bank debt, bank indebtedness and
obligations under finance leases, net of cash.
Income tax expense
The effective income tax rate of 26.0% for the quarter decreased from
27.2% the previous year due primarily to the impact of reduced
statutory income tax rates.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the effective income tax
rate of 26.5% decreased from 27.3% in the previous year as a result of
the impact of reduced statutory income tax rates and lower expenses not
deductible for tax purposes.
Net earnings
Quarterly net earnings decreased $1.7 million to $16.2 million, or $0.97
per share, from $17.9 million, or $1.08 per share, in the same quarter
of 2011. The negative impact of reduced volumes and a lower gross
profit margin percentage more than offset decreased selling and
administrative expenses and lower finance costs compared to the same
quarter last year.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, net earnings increased
$4.5 million to $51.7 million, or $3.10 per share, from $47.2 million,
or $2.84 per share, in the same period in 2011. The positive impact of
higher volumes and lower finance costs more than compensated for the
lower gross profit margin percentage and increased selling and
administrative expenses compared to the same period last year.
Comprehensive income
Total comprehensive income of $16.0 million in the third quarter of 2012
included net earnings of $16.2 million less an other comprehensive loss
of $0.2 million. The other comprehensive loss of $0.2 million resulted
primarily from losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow
hedges outstanding at the end of the quarter.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, total comprehensive income
of $51.7 million included net earnings of $51.7 million and a nominal
other comprehensive loss.
Funded net debt
Funded net debt of $139.3 million at September 30, 2012 increased $20.0
million compared to June 30, 2012. Increases in operating assets and
liabilities ("operating working capital") of $23.2 million resulted in
negative cash flows from operating activities for the quarter of $4.2
million. Other uses of cash included dividends paid of $13.6 million,
investing activities of $1.5 million and finance lease payments of $0.3
million. Wajax&apos;s quarter-end funded net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.58:1
at September 30, 2012 increased from the June 30, 2012 ratio of 0.50:1.
Funded net debt of $139.3 million at September 30, 2012 increased $75.6
million compared to December 31, 2011. Increases in operating working
capital of $89.0 million resulted in negative cash flows from operating
activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2012 of $30.3
million. Other uses of cash included dividends paid of $37.0 million,
investing activities of $5.4 million and finance lease payments of $1.7
million. Wajax&apos;s period-end funded net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.58:1
at September 30, 2012 increased from the December 31, 2011 ratio of
0.28:1.

November 30, 2012, December 31, 2012, January 31, 2013 and February 28,
2013, respectively.
Backlog
Consolidated backlog at September 30, 2012 of $202.4 million decreased
$41.6 million or 17% compared to June 30, 2012 due to reductions in the
Equipment and Industrial Components segments, partially offset by
increases in the Power Systems segment. Consolidated backlog decreased
$61.4 million compared to September 30, 2011 on reductions in all
segments. Backlog includes the total retail value of customer purchase
orders for future delivery or commissioning. See the Results of
Operations section for further backlog detail by segment.

Revenue in the third quarter of 2012 increased $16.3 million, or 9%, to
$194.2 million from $177.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Segment earnings for the quarter increased $0.6 million to $13.3
million compared to the third quarter of 2011. The following factors
contributed to the Equipment segment&apos;s third quarter results:
Equipment revenue for the third quarter increased $16.0 million compared
to the same quarter last year. Specific quarter-over-quarter variances
included the following:
Construction equipment revenue increased $10.2 million mainly as a
result of market demand which drove increases in sales of Hitachi
excavators, primarily in western Canada. Higher Wirtgen road building
equipment sales in Ontario and increased JCB construction equipment
volumes also contributed to the increase.
Material handling equipment revenue increased $3.4 million on higher
volumes in all regions.
Crane and utility equipment revenue increased $1.1 million attributable
to higher new equipment sales to utility customers in Ontario and
eastern Canada, offset partially by lower crane sales in western
Canada.
Mining equipment sales increased $1.1 million. The delivery of two
LeTourneau loaders in eastern Canada was somewhat offset by fewer
Hitachi mining equipment deliveries in western Canada.
Forestry equipment revenues increased $0.2 million.
Parts and service volumes for the third quarter increased $0.3 million
compared to the same quarter last year. Excluding the LeTourneau
product line, which was discontinued in the second quarter of this
year, parts and service volumes for the third quarter increased $4.9
million, or 9%. Higher mining, construction and forestry sector sales,
primarily in western Canada, were offset by lower materials handling
and crane & utilities sector volumes in all regions.
Segment earnings for the third quarter increased $0.6 million to $13.3
million compared to the same quarter last year. The positive impact of
higher volumes outweighed the negative impact of a lower gross profit
margin resulting from a higher proportion of equipment sales and a $0.6
million increase in selling and administrative expenses. Selling and
administrative expenses increased compared to the same quarter last
year on higher personnel and sales related expenses.
Backlog of $95.4 million at September 30, 2012 decreased $38.5 million
compared to June 30, 2012. Mining equipment backlog declined on a
reduction of customer orders and the delivery of the last two
LeTourneau loaders. In addition, construction and forestry sector
related backlog is lower as manufacturers&apos; inventory levels currently
allow for timelier product shipments. Backlog decreased $50.5 million
compared to September 30, 2011 due mainly to reduced mining equipment
backlog.
Effective November 2, 2012, the Equipment segment became the exclusive
Canadian distributor of Bell articulated dump trucks. These trucks,
manufactured by Bell Equipment Limited, are one of the world&apos;s leading
truck lines for construction, quarry and medium duty resource
applications and are sold in 80 countries. Wajax estimates the annual
size of the Canadian market to be at least 500 units, or $225 million.
Wajax also estimates the existing Canadian installed base of trucks
manufactured by Bell to be approximately 300 units, which is expected
to yield an immediate parts and service opportunity. The geographic
scope and capability of Equipment&apos;s Canada-wide distribution network
were central factors in securing distribution rights to this
world-class product line.
On October 17, 2011, Wajax announced it had reached an agreement with
LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. ("LeTourneau") providing for the dealer
agreement relating to Wajax&apos;s distribution of LeTourneau mining
equipment and parts products in Canada to be discontinued effective
April 27, 2012. Wajax Equipment delivered all the remaining equipment
orders in backlog during the quarter. LeTourneau revenue for the nine
months ended September 30, 2012 included equipment sales of $25.6
million and parts and service volumes of $13.0 million and contributed
approximately $8 million to the Equipment segments earnings.

Revenue in the third quarter of 2012 decreased $22.4 million, or 23%, to
$75.6 million compared to $98.0 million in the same quarter of 2011. Segment earnings decreased $3.7 million to $6.0 million in the third
quarter compared to the same quarter in the previous year. The
following factors impacted quarterly revenue and earnings compared to
last year:
Equipment revenue decreased $16.7 million. The majority of the decrease
was due to lower equipment volumes to off-highway oil and gas customers
as a result of reduced industry activity in western Canada. In
addition, lower volumes from an OEM customer in Ontario more than
offset increased power generation equipment sales.
Parts and service volumes decreased $5.7 million compared to last year
mainly as a result of lower sales to off-highway customers resulting
from reduced activity in western Canada&apos;s oil and gas sector. Increased power generation parts and service volumes essentially offset
reduced sales to on-highway customers.
Segment earnings in the third quarter of 2012 decreased $3.7 million
compared to the same quarter last year as the impact of lower volumes
and reduced equipment margins was mitigated somewhat by a $1.1 million
decrease in selling and administrative expenses. Selling and
administrative expenses decreased due mainly to lower annual incentive
accruals.
Backlog of $65.5 million as of September 30, 2012 increased $4.6 million
compared to June 30, 2012 as a large power generation order received in
the Ontario region during the quarter offset the impact of a decline in
oil and gas sector related backlog. Backlog decreased $5.0 million
compared to September 30, 2011 due to lower oil and gas sector related
backlog.

Revenue of $87.5 million in the third quarter of 2012 increased $0.8
million from $86.7 million in the third quarter of 2011. Segment
earnings decreased $0.7 million to $5.5 million in the third quarter
compared to the same quarter in the previous year. The following
factors contributed to the segment&apos;s third quarter results:
Bearings and power transmission parts sales increased $1.8 million, or
4%, compared to the same quarter last year led by higher mining sector
volumes in Ontario and western Canada, improved transportation sector
sales in eastern Canada and increased oil and gas and construction
sector sales in western Canada. These increases were offset by a
decline in revenue from industrial sector customers in eastern Canada
and Ontario.
Fluid power and process equipment products and service revenue in the
third quarter of 2012 decreased $1.0 million, or 2%. Lower mining
sector sales in western Canada and Ontario and lower oil and gas sector
volumes more than offset higher sales to agriculture and metal
processing sector customers.
Segment earnings in the third quarter of 2012 decreased $0.7 million
compared to the same quarter last year due mainly to a $0.8 million
increase in selling and administration expenses. The increase in
selling and administrative expenses resulted primarily from higher
personnel and sales related costs and computer system upgrade expenses.
Backlog of $41.5 million as of September 30, 2012 decreased $7.7 million
compared to June 30, 2012. During the quarter, $3.7 million of orders
were removed from backlog due primarily to the indefinite delay of an
order for the supply of hydraulic systems and related parts into the
oil and gas sector. Backlog decreased $5.7 million compared to
September 30, 2011.
On October 22, 2012, Industrial Components acquired all of the issued
and outstanding shares of ACE Hydraulic Limited, a hydraulic cylinder
repair business located in Bathurst, New Brunswick with revenues of
approximately $2.0 million. The consideration for the business was $1.7
million, subject to post-closing adjustments. The acquisition
represents an important step towards the segment&apos;s strategy of
expanding its engineering, service and repair capabilities across
Canada.

Cash Flow, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash Flows Used In Operating Activities
Net cash flows used in operating activities amounted to $4.2 million in
the third quarter of 2012, compared to $26.7 million generated in the
same quarter of the previous year. The $30.9 million decrease was due
mainly to an increased use of operating assets and liabilities
("operating working capital") of $24.3 million, higher rental equipment
additions of $4.5 million and lower cash flows from operating
activities before changes in operating working capital of $1.8 million.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, net cash flows used in
operating activities amounted to $30.3 million, compared to $12.5
million generated for the same period in the previous year. The $42.8
million decrease was due primarily to an increased use of operating
working capital of $42.1 million, higher rental equipment additions of
$6.3 million and other liabilities of $2.6 million. This was partially
offset by higher cash flows from operating activities before changes in
operating working capital of $7.8 million.
Changes in operating working capital for the three and nine months of
2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 include the following

Significant components of the changes in operating working capital for
the quarter ended September 30, 2012 are as follows:
Trade and other receivables decreased $11.4 million resulting from lower
sales activity in the Power Systems segment&apos;s western Canada operation
and in the Industrial Components segment.
Inventories increased $5.3 million due mainly to higher mining equipment
inventory in the Equipment segment.
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $31.6 million
reflecting reductions in the Equipment segment&apos;s non-interest bearing
inventory supplier financing and customer deposits related to mining
equipment sales. Lower inventory related trade payables, in the
Industrial Components and Power Systems segments, also contributed to
the decrease.
Significant components of the changes in operating working capital for
the nine months ended September 30, 2012 are as follows:
Trade and other receivables increased $10.2 million. A significant
increase in the Equipment segment related to mining equipment
deliveries was partially offset by reductions in the Power Systems
segment on lower sales activity.
Inventories increased $47.9 million due mainly to a $26.8 million
increase in mining equipment in the Equipment segment. Also
contributing to the increase were higher levels of construction
equipment in the Equipment segment, project related engines in Power
Systems segment&apos;s eastern Canada operation and increased stock levels
in the Industrial Components segment&apos;s western Canada operation.
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $31.4 million
reflecting reductions in the Equipment segment. This was attributable
to decreased customer deposits related to mining equipment sales and
lower non-interest bearing inventory supplier financing partially
offset by increases in inventory trade payables. Lower inventory
related trade payables in the Power Systems segment and a reduction in
annual incentive accruals also contributed to the decrease.
On the consolidated statement of financial position at September 30,
2012, Wajax had employed $214.2 million in current assets net of
current liabilities, exclusive of funded net debt, compared to $165.0
million at December 31, 2011. The $49.2 million increase was due
primarily to the $89.0 million increase in operating working capital as
detailed above, offset partially by an increase of $39.9 million in
income taxes payable due in January 2013. The $39.9 million increase in
income taxes payable includes approximately $23 million of tax on
partnership income generated in 2011 and tax on income to be included
in 2012 taxable income. See Liquidity and Capital Resources section
for further detail.
Investing Activities
During the third quarter of 2012, Wajax invested $1.4 million in
property, plant and equipment additions, net of disposals, compared to
$0.8 million in the third quarter of 2011. Investing activities in the
third quarter of 2011 also included $1.7 million of cash paid on
post-closing adjustments related to the acquisition of Harper.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, Wajax invested $5.2
million in property, plant and equipment additions, net of disposals,
compared to $2.7 million in the same period of 2011. The increase of
$2.5 million includes $1.9 million of shop equipment related to the
Power Systems segment&apos;s new leased facility in Drummondville, Quebec. Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 also
included $23.3 million of cash paid on the acquisition of Harper.
Financing Activities
The Corporation generated $15.1 million of cash from financing
activities in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $18.3 million of
cash used in financing activities in the same quarter of 2011.
Financing activities in the quarter included bank debt borrowings of
$29.0 million, offset partially by dividends paid to shareholders
totaling $13.6 million, or $0.81 per share and finance lease payments
of $0.3 million.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the Corporation generated
$24.0 million of cash from financing activities compared to $31.3
million of cash used in financing activities in the same period of
2011. Financing activities for the nine months ended included bank debt
borrowing of $63.0 million, offset partially by dividends paid to
shareholders totaling $37.0 million, or $2.22 per share, finance lease
payments of $1.7 million and debt facility amendment costs of $0.2
million.
Funded net debt of $139.3 million at September 30, 2012 increased $20.0
million compared to June 30, 2012. Increases in operating working
capital of $23.2 million resulted in negative cash flows from operating
activities for the quarter of $4.2 million. Other uses of cash
included dividends paid of $13.6 million, investing activities of $1.5
million and finance lease payments of $0.3 million. Wajax&apos;s
quarter-end funded net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.58:1 at September 30,
2012 increased from the June 30, 2012 ratio of 0.50:1.
Funded net debt of $139.3 million at September 30, 2012 increased $75.6
million compared to December 31, 2011. Increases in operating working
capital of $89.0 million resulted in negative cash flows from operating
activities for the nine months ending September 30, 2012 of $30.3
million. Other uses of cash included dividends paid of $37.0 million,
investing activities of $5.4 million and finance lease payments of $1.7
million. Wajax&apos;s period-end funded net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.58:1
at September 30, 2012 increased from the December 31, 2011 ratio of
0.28:1.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At September 30, 2012, Wajax had borrowed $123.0 million and issued $6.2
million of letters of credit for a total utilization of $129.2 million
of its $225 million bank credit facility and had no utilization of its
$15 million equipment financing facility. Borrowing capacity under the
bank credit facility is dependent on the level of inventories on-hand
and outstanding trade accounts receivables. At September 30, 2012
borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility was equal to $225.0
million.
Since its conversion back to a corporation on January 1, 2011, Wajax has
not made any significant income tax payments and will not be required
to make any such payments until 2013. This is due to income tax
payments being deferred as a result of its partnership structure. In
January 2013, Wajax will be required to make an income tax payment of
approximately $44 million. This includes approximately $23 million of
tax on partnership income generated in 2011 and the balance
representing tax on income to be included in 2012 taxable income as a
result of a change in tax legislation that has effectively removed the
partnership income deferral benefit. The Corporation will also commence
making monthly income tax installments in January 2013.
A key strategy of the Equipment segment is to grow its mining business
through expansion into eastern Canada and the introduction of the new
Hitachi mining truck. To ensure mining equipment is available to
execute its strategy, Wajax has ordered certain mining equipment (large
excavators and trucks) that do not currently have committed purchase
orders. As such, since the beginning of the year Wajax has increased
its investment in Hitachi mining equipment inventory by $26.8 million
to $31.9 million as at September 30, 2012 of which $16.4 million is
available to fill future customer purchases. Depending on the level of
economic activity in the Canadian mining sector, Wajax may continue to
finance a portion of this and other mining equipment scheduled for
delivery in late 2012 and 2013 for a period of time during 2013.
Wajax&apos;s $225 million bank credit facility along with the $15 million
demand inventory equipment financing facility should be sufficient to
meet Wajax&apos;s short-term normal course working capital and maintenance
capital requirements, including the income tax payment in January 2013
and additional mining equipment inventory. However, Wajax may be
required to access the equity or debt markets in order to fund
acquisitions and growth related working capital and capital
expenditures.
Financial Instruments
Wajax uses derivative financial instruments in the management of its
foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Wajax&apos;s policy is not to
utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes. Significant derivative financial instruments outstanding at
the end of the quarter were as follows:
As at September 30, 2012, Wajax had no interest rate swaps outstanding. (As at September 30, 2011, Wajax was party to interest rate swaps that
effectively fixed the interest rate on $80 million of debt until
December 31, 2011).
Wajax enters into short-term currency forward contracts to fix the
exchange rate on the cost of certain inbound inventory and to hedge
certain foreign currency-denominated sales to (receivables from)
customers as part of its normal course of business. As at September
30, 2012, Wajax had contracts outstanding to buy U.S.$25.8 million and
to sell U.S.$4.1 million (December 31, 2011 - to buy U.S.$36.0 million
and €0.2 million and to sell U.S.$1.0 million, September 30, 2011 - to
buy U.S.$29.8 million). The U.S. dollar contracts expire between
October 2012 and April 2014, with a weighted average U.S./Canadian
dollar rate of 1.0038.
Wajax measures derivative instruments not accounted for as hedging
items, at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value being
recorded in earnings. Derivatives designated as effective hedges are
measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value being
recorded in other comprehensive income until the related hedged item is
recorded and affects income. The fair value of derivative instruments
is estimated based upon market conditions using appropriate valuation
models. The carrying values reported in the balance sheet for
financial instruments are not significantly different from their fair
values.
Wajax is exposed to the risk of non-performance by counterparties to
short-term currency forward contracts. These counterparties are large
financial institutions with a "Stable" outlook and high short-term and
long-term credit ratings from Standard and Poor&apos;s. To date, no such
counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to Wajax. Management does not believe there is a significant risk of
non-performance by these counterparties and will continue to monitor
the credit risk of these counterparties.
Currency Risk
There have been no material changes to currency risk since December 31,
2011.
Contractual Obligations
There have been no material changes to the Corporation&apos;s contractual
obligations since December 31, 2011.
Off Balance Sheet Financing
Off balance sheet financing arrangements include operating lease
contracts entered into for facilities with various landlords, a portion
of the long-term lift truck rental fleet in Equipment with a non-bank
lender, and office equipment with various non-bank lenders. There have
been no material changes to the Corporation&apos;s total obligations for all
operating leases since December 31, 2011, see the Contractual
Obligations section.
Although Wajax&apos;s consolidated contractual annual lease commitments
decline year-by-year, it is anticipated that existing leases will
either be renewed or replaced, resulting in lease commitments being
sustained at current levels. In the alternative, Wajax may incur
capital expenditures to acquire equivalent capacity.
The Equipment segment had $91.2 million (2011 - $26.1 million) of
consigned inventory on-hand from a major manufacturer at September 30,
2012. In the normal course of business, Wajax receives inventory on
consignment from this manufacturer which is generally sold to customers
or purchased by Wajax. This consigned inventory is not included in
Wajax&apos;s inventory as the manufacturer retains title to the goods.
In the event the inventory consignment program was terminated, Wajax
would utilize interest free financing, if any, made available by the
manufacturer and/or utilize capacity under its credit facilities. Although management currently believes Wajax has adequate debt
capacity, Wajax would have to access the equity or debt markets, or
temporarily reduce dividends to accommodate any shortfalls in Wajax&apos;s
credit facilities. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.

Productive Capacity and Productive Capacity Management
There have been no material changes to the Corporation&apos;s productive
capacity and productive capacity management since December 31, 2011.
Financing Strategies
Wajax&apos;s $225 million bank credit facility along with the $15 million
demand inventory equipment financing facility should be sufficient to
meet Wajax&apos;s short-term normal course working capital and maintenance
capital requirements, including the income tax payment in January 2013
and additional mining equipment inventory. However, Wajax may be
required to access the equity or debt markets in order to fund
acquisitions and growth related working capital and capital
expenditures. See Liquidity and Capital Resources section for
additional detail.
Wajax&apos;s short-term normal course requirements for current assets net of
current liabilities, exclusive of funded net debt, ("working capital")
can swing widely quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of large
inventory purchases and/or sales and changes in market activity. In
general, as Wajax experiences growth, there is a need for additional
working capital as was the case in 2011 and currently in 2012. Conversely, as Wajax experiences economic slowdowns working capital
reduces reflecting the lower activity levels as was the case in 2009. Fluctuations in working capital are generally funded by, or used to
repay, the bank credit facility.
Borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility is dependent on the
level of Wajax&apos;s inventories on-hand and outstanding trade accounts
receivables. At September 30, 2012, total borrowing capacity under the
bank credit facility was equal to $225 million of which $129.2 million
was utilized at September 30, 2012.
The bank credit facility contains covenants that could restrict the
ability of Wajax to make dividend payments, if (i) the leverage ratio
(Debt to EBITDA) is greater than 3.0 at the time of declaration of the
dividend, and (ii) an event of default exists or would exist as a
result of a dividend payment.
Share Capital
The shares of Wajax issued are included in shareholders&apos; equity on the
balance sheet as follows:

Wajax has five share-based compensation plans; the Wajax Share Ownership
Plan ("SOP"), the Deferred Share Program ("DSP"), the Directors&apos;
Deferred Share Unit Plan ("DDSUP"), the Mid-Term Incentive Plan for
Senior Executives ("MTIP") and the Deferred Share Unit Plan ("DSUP"). SOP, DSP and DDSUP rights are issued to the participants and are
settled by issuing Wajax Corporation shares. The cash-settled MTIP and
DSUP consist of annual grants that vest over three years and are
subject to time and performance vesting criteria. A portion of the
MTIP and the full amount of the DSUP grants are determined by the price
of the Corporation&apos;s shares. Compensation expense for the SOP, DSP and
DDSUP is determined based upon the fair value of the rights at the date
of grant and charged to earnings on a straight line basis over the
vesting period, with an offsetting adjustment to contributed surplus. Compensation expense for the DSUP and the share-based portion of the
MTIP varies with the price of the Corporation&apos;s shares and is
recognized over the vesting period. Wajax recorded compensation cost
of $0.6 million for the quarter (2011 - $1.2 million) and $3.7 million
for the nine months ended (2011 - $3.6 million) in respect of these
plans.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. The Corporation bases its estimates on
historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable in the circumstances.
The areas where significant judgements and assumptions are used to
determine the amounts recognized in the financial statements include
the provision for doubtful accounts, inventory obsolescence, asset
impairment, classification of leases, impairment of intangible assets,
warranty provision and the measurement of employee defined benefit
obligations. In preparing the financial statements for the quarter
ended September 30, 2012, the significant judgments made by management
in applying the Corporation&apos;s accounting policies and the key sources
of estimation uncertainty are the same as those applied in the recently
reported audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2011 which can be found on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Accounting ChangesStandards and interpretations not yet effective
In its MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2011 the Corporation
described numerous new accounting standards which have been published
but which have not yet been adopted by the Corporation. There have
been no updates to these standards except as follows:
During the first quarter of 2012, the Corporation assessed the impact of
adopting IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and does not believe that it will have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements because of the types of financial
instruments that it holds.
As of January 1, 2013, the Corporation will be required to adopt
amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which contain new disclosure requirements for financial assets and
financial liabilities that are offset in the statement of financial
position. The Corporation is currently assessing the impact of the
amendments to this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
As of January 1, 2014, the Corporation will be required to adopt
amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, which clarifies the conditions for offsetting financial assets and
financial liabilities. As the amendments only require changes in the
presentation of items in the statement of financial position, the
Corporation does not expect the amendments to IAS 32 to have a material
impact on the financial statements.
Risk Management and Uncertainties
As with most businesses, Wajax is subject to a number of marketplace and
industry related risks and uncertainties which could have a material
impact on operating results and Wajax&apos;s ability to pay cash dividends
to shareholders. Wajax attempts to minimize many of these risks through
diversification of core businesses and through the geographic diversity
of its operations. In addition, Wajax has adopted an annual enterprise
risk management assessment which is prepared by the Corporation&apos;s
senior management and overseen by the Board of Directors and Committees
of the Board. The enterprise risk management framework sets out
principles and tools for identifying, evaluating, prioritizing and
managing risk effectively and consistently across Wajax. There are
however, a number of risks that deserve particular comment which are
discussed in detail in the MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2011
which can be found on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. There have been no material changes to the business of Wajax that
require an update to the discussion of the applicable risks discussed
in the MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Outlook
Overall results for the quarter met management&apos;s expectations. The
Equipment segment continued to grow earnings year-over-year in spite of
the loss of the LeTourneau product support business. The Equipment
segment enjoyed higher equipment sales on stronger construction and
material handling markets. Softer economic conditions, particularly
related to the western Canadian oil and gas sector, negatively impacted
profitability in the Power Systems and Industrial Components segments. Overall backlog declined primarily as a result of a reduction in
customer orders in the mining and oil and gas sectors and the delivery
of the last two LeTourneau mining loaders. While the number of
outstanding quotes for mining equipment continues to be significant,
customers have been delaying their purchasing decisions in the face of
lower commodity prices.
Looking forward Wajax expects softness in the oil and gas and mining
sectors to continue into 2013. This, combined with initial signs of
some slowing in other areas of the Canadian economy leads management to
a more cautious view of near term results. However, management
continues to expect that full year earnings will be modestly higher
compared to 2011.
Wajax believes the addition of the Bell truck line will play an
important role in the continued growth of its Equipment segment. Management remains confident in its strategy and will continue to
invest in its mining equipment inventory program and other strategic
initiatives to ensure Wajax is well positioned to capitalize on market
opportunities as customer purchasing decisions accelerate.
Additional information, including Wajax&apos;s Annual Report and Annual
Information Form, are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

address of the Corporation&apos;s registered office is 3280 Wharton Way,
Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The Corporation&apos;s core distribution
businesses are engaged in the sale and after-sale parts and service
support of equipment, power systems and industrial components, through

multi-line distributor and represents a number of leading worldwide
manufacturers across its core businesses. Its customer base is
diversified, spanning natural resources, construction, transportation,
manufacturing, industrial processing and utilities.
2.BASIS OF PREPARATIONStatement of compliance
These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting and do not include all of the disclosures required for full
consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, these condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the audited consolidated financial statements of Wajax Corporation for
the year ended December 31, 2011. The significant accounting policies
follow those disclosed in the most recently reported audited
consolidated financial statements.
Basis of measurement
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under
the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments
and liabilities for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements that
have been measured at fair value. The employee benefit liability is
recognized as the net total of the pension plan assets, plus
unrecognized past service cost and unrecognized actuarial losses, less
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and the present value of the
defined benefit obligation.
Functional and presentation currency
These condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in
Canadian dollars, which is the Corporation&apos;s functional currency. All
financial information presented in Canadian dollars has been rounded to
the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated and except share and per
share data.
3.RENTAL EQUIPMENT
The Corporation acquired rental equipment with a cost of $7,926 during
the quarter (2011 - $3,472) and $21,493 year to date (2011 - $15,181).
Rental equipment with a carrying amount of $596 during the quarter
(2011 - $230) and $1,246 year to date (2011 - $2,296) ceased to be
rented and was classified as held for sale in the normal course of
business and transferred to inventories.
4.PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
The Corporation acquired property, plant and equipment with a cost of
$1,469 during the quarter (2011 - $811) and $5,648 year to date (2011 -
$2,775). Assets with a carrying amount of $91 during the quarter (2011
- $30) and $624 year to date (2011 - $71) were disposed of, resulting
in gains on disposal of $17 during the quarter (2011 - loss of $2) and
losses on disposal of $129 year to date (2011 - gain of $14).
5.BANK DEBT
On May 24, 2012, the Corporation amended its bank credit facility to
increase the limit of the revolving term portion of the facility by
$50,000 on substantially the same terms and conditions as the existing
facility. The fully secured facility, due August 12, 2016, is now
comprised of a $30,000 non-revolving term portion and a $195,000
revolving term portion. The $225 cost of amending the facility has
been capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining term of the
facility.

Income tax expense
$
18,693
$

The calculation of current tax is based on a combined federal and
provincial statutory income tax rate of 26.2% (2011 - 27.7%). The tax
rate for the current year is 1.5% lower than 2011 due to the effect of
the reduced statutory tax rates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when
the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities have been measured using an expected average combined
statutory income tax rate of 26.1% based on the tax rates in years when
the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The reconciliation of effective income tax is as follows:

A potential multibillion-dollar class action against the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce for allegedly misleading investors about its exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages in 2007 could have succeeded at trial, but must be scrapped because of a time limit, an Ontario judge has ruled.In a 163-page decision that describes CIBC as “scrambling” to understand the unfolding financial crisis in 2007, Mr. Justice George Strathy of the Ontario Superior Court ruled that several of the plaintiffs’ allegations that the bank misrepresented its risks to its investors had a “reasonable possibility of success” at a trial.
