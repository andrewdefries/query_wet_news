The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus
Directed by Terry Gilliam
Written by Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown
Starring Christopher Plummer, Heath Ledger, Lily Cole
Classification: PG
The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus takes us deep into the imagination of Terry Gilliam, which once was a splendid place to visit. And might prove so again. But not here, because this film is less a coherent exercise of imagination than a haphazard lecture on its importance, a lecture that eventually dwindles into self-indulgence. Given his talent and his many moviemaking travails, it's easy to feel sorry for Gilliam, but a lot harder to see him feeling sorry for himself.
Also in our film package

Sherlock Holmes

Tellingly, we start with a relic from the past ambling through the chaos of the present. A team of horses pulls a medicine show wagon, a travelling stage, along the busy streets of modern London. Most everyone ignores it, save for a few drunken revellers spilling out of a pub. In the wagon is the immortal Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), attended by his teenage daughter Valentina (Lily Cole), an assistant called Anton (Andrew Garfield), and, since the whole enterprise is already surpassingly weird, Percy the requisite dwarf (Verne Troyer). Requisite too is the looking glass at stage centre. Paying customers passing through it enter the teeming mind of Parnassus himself, and then, duly impressed, get spit back to their humdrum world.
Of course, this realm of the fantastic is an obvious correlative of Gilliam's cinematic imaginarium, which houses such wonders as
Brazil and
Time Bandits . But this time, tricked out with CG effects, it's more wonky than wonderful, and mainly forgettable. Even what's remembered, like that singing chorus of transvestite cops, is better forgotten. Meant to be a blissful escape, the place too often feels like a tedious trap, and on the whole we're glad to be expelled back to London.
There, Dr. P continues his centuries-old spat with Nick the gravel-voiced devil (who else but Tom Waits)

The Weekly Challenge is a column that tackles self-improvement seven days at a time. If you’re the type of person who follows health and food trends, you already know that going gluten-free is the Atkins craze for a new decade of dieters, with “wheat” occupying the same dirty-word status once held by carbs. About six per cent of the population suffers from celiac disease or gluten intolerance, but it’s more than just medical necessity that has spurred a multibillion-dollar industry in gluten-free eating in North America.

Could I go to a celeb-packed TIFF party as a teetotaller?
Kim Kardashian and Miley Cyrus shared their tales of wheatless weight loss earlier this year. The medical community is still at odds over the validity of this diet for people who do not need it. Detractors say that gluten promotes heart and immune system health, and point out that slapping a “gluten-free” label on a box of high-calorie cookies doesn’t make them healthy.But given that Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight and Find Your Path Back to Health has spent more than 25 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, it would appear that the train has left the station (with Kim Kardashian as conductor – help us). Food bigotry and faking it I began Operation: G-Free by contemplating my own wheat-related issues. I don’t have celiac, but the far more common “gluten sensitivity” is hard to diagnose, with symptoms such as headaches, bloating and fatigue. (Check, check and check). I admit I have not been all that sensitive to food sensitivity issues in the past, a gentle way of saying I have been known to judge people based on the persnicketiness of their diets.I guess this makes me a food bigot, and ignorant: My biggest trepidation about going gluten-free over Thanksgiving weekend was missing out on mashed potatoes. I must have mentioned this to three people before a friend finally pointed out that potatoes don’t contain gluten. “But what about butter and cream and salt?” I challenged. No gluten there either.A lot of the food I consumed over my gluten-free week was delicious, and a lot of it (I’m looking at you, gluten-free crackers) was subpar. The least successful meals were what I refer to as “faking-it food,” similar to when a vegetarian tries to make shepherd’s pie using veggie ground round.
