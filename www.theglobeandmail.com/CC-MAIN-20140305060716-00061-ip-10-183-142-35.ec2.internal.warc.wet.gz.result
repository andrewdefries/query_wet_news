Oh, that Culture War. Yes, the war that some of you think isn't happening. Because Canadians are too polite, or something.
Hello? Yesterday readers of this great newspaper woke up to learn this: "Tory culture warriors target CBC 'vested interests'" The gist is this: There's a new Conservative Party fundraising plea. Because they need your pennies, pronto. It costs money to put the PM's hair in the fridge every night. But seriously, folks, the purported reason is something like this - the CBC is a $1-billion Liberal propaganda machine, paid for with taxpayers' money. It must be stopped. Or something.

Why aren't Canada's lefties ready to rumble?
Morning buzz
Tory culture warriors target CBC 'vested interests'
Now that's what I call funny. Attacking the CBC is kinda redundant. First, the CBC keeps shooting itself in the foot. Second, CBC has bent and twisted so much to accommodate conservative views that, with the shot-up foot and all, it is staggering around, bleeding, disoriented and struggling to figure out the way forward.
Sure, this anti-CBC blast from the Conservative's money-gathering machine seems well-timed. Simultaneously, a Conservative MP wants the Commons Heritage committee to investigate CBC's relationship with EKOS pollster Frank Graves. Because Graves told the Liberals to stand fast and pit "cosmopolitan versus parochialism, secularism versus moralism, Obama versus Palin, tolerance versus racism and homophobia...." And because Graves appears on CBC NN regularly to talk polling results. He is, in fact, the CBC's own pollster, paid to poll Canadians for the broadcaster.
Piffle. The real reason for the anti-CBC assault is to demonize the messenger while an unpopular message is getting out. You think it's a coincidence that CBC is being attacked while the minority Conservative government is promoting a policy best summarized by this headline, "Ottawa refuses to fund abortion in G8 plan."? You really think that?
Ask yourself what, as the government and Conservative Party figure it, might be the main vehicle for opposition to this plan? That would be the CBC. So, you know, let's attack the darn CBC before it gets started on this. Before somebody on the CBC points out that it might be the height of hypocrisy for a Canadian government to decline to provide in developing countries what Canadians accept as a given.
In this context, attacking the CBC might seem cunning to somebody raising money for the Conservatives, but in reality it is ludicrous. As I write this, CBC NN is on in my office and Suhana Meharchand is cackling with unbounded glee about the premiere of the movie
Iron Man 2. She just said, "Wow!" And then along comes Jelena Adzic, and she and Suhana go all girly and OMG about footage of the star-studded premiere of
Iron Man 2. Adzic has just announced breathlessly that a block of Hollywood Boulevard was closed to traffic for the premiere. Much cackling and near delirium has ensued. I'm not sure what Liberal bias is afoot here.
Fact is, CBC News has contor

Do I really need four winter tires, or can I just get two on the front of my front-wheel drive van?– PBIf you've got winter tires on your van's front wheels and all seasons on the back, your front tires will stick while your back tires will slide – and your car could spin right off the road.“The rear tires won't be able to grip as well as the front tires,” says Denise Koeth, managing editor of Tire Review, a tire industry magazine. “When braking or turning, the rear tires could break loose, losing traction and causing the van to fishtail.”

Sherry Mantyka witnessed too many students entering university without an understanding of multiplication, addition or basic algorithm. They passed high-school math, and had strong enough admission grades to earn a place in university. Yet, something was missing in their math skills."It’s so tragic when students are coming out of high-school with such a big handicap ahead of them and there is no need for it," Dr. Mantyka said.
