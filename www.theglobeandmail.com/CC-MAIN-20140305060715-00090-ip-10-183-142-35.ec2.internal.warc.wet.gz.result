A few weeks back,
Globe and Mail writer Ian Brown wrote an article about the inevitability of staring at good-looking women. Spring brings temperate weather and temperate weather leads to less layering and more revealing clothing and more revealing clothing leads to fellows feeling their temperatures rise. Think of it as the male gaze as sponsored by global warming.

Why men can't - and shouldn't - stop staring at women
Whenever someone has an interesting idea, I like to play a little game called “in a car.” I just take the idea and put “in a car” at the end of it and, hey presto, you’ve got an insightful essay that entertains while it enlightens.
To be fair, I was already considering writing a “think piece” about how men can’t resist staring at women from cars, but the furor that ensued after Brown’s story was published convinced me this was an automotive issue that required immediate examination. Plus, for for a few weeks last month and this month, everywhere I drive there are women walking around who aren’t wearing parkas. It’s distracting.
There is no way to know precisely, but it’s fair to say that there are probably millions of car accidents caused by drivers whose attentions are diverted by the world’s oldest distraction. It happens so often that insurance companies should have a specific category for it, something like the “forlorn hope” or the “pathetic leer.” I’ve often wondered if, when a driver rear-ends the car in front of him while eye-loving a passerby, he feels remorse. Does he think, “I’m so stupid” or does he think, “I’m only human.”
That’s the cornerstone of the activity. That it is impossible not to stare at a person you find attractive and the car provides the perfect vehicle for said pursuit.
Face it. Men have been eyeing women from cars since the

PVH Corp. Reports 2013 First Quarter Results
16:02 EDT Wednesday, June 12, 2013
NEW YORK (Business Wire) -- PVH Corp. [NYSE: PVH] reported 2013 first quarter results.
Non-GAAP Amounts:
The discussions of historical results in this release that refer to
non-GAAP amounts exclude the items which are described in this release
under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions.” Reconciliations of GAAP to
non-GAAP amounts are presented later in this release and identify and
quantify all excluded items.
Overview of First Quarter Results:
Earnings per share was $1.91 on a non-GAAP basis, which significantly
exceeded the Company's guidance, as compared to the prior year's first
quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.33.
GAAP loss per share was $(0.25) as compared to the prior year's first
quarter GAAP earnings per share of $1.30, due to significant costs
incurred in connection with the Company's acquisition during the
quarter of its former licensee, The Warnaco Group, Inc. (“Warnaco”),
and with the related integration and restructuring, a significant
portion of which was non-cash.
Revenue on a non-GAAP basis of $1.940 billion exceeded guidance by $40
million and increased 36% as compared to the prior year's first
quarter (which was in accordance with GAAP). The increase was
principally driven by the addition of approximately $487 million of
revenue related to the newly acquired Warnaco businesses, net of a
reduction in licensing revenue attributable to Warnaco from the prior
year, and an increase of $41 million related to the Tommy Hilfiger
business, partially offset by the loss of $28 million attributable to
the Izod women's and Timberland wholesale sportswear businesses, which
the Company exited in 2012. On a GAAP basis, revenue of $1.910 billion
was $30 million lower than non-GAAP revenue due to sales returns for
certain Warnaco wholesale customers in Asia in connection with an
initiative to reduce excess inventory levels.
Segment Presentation
The acquisition of Warnaco has significantly impacted the way the
Company manages and analyzes its operating results. Beginning with the
first quarter, the Company changed how it discusses its business
segments and results. The Company aggregates its segments into three
main businesses: (i) Calvin Klein, which now consists of the Calvin
Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments; (ii) Tommy
Hilfiger, which consists of the Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy
Hilfiger International segments; and (iii) Heritage Brands, which now
consists of the Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail
segments, whose operations are in North America and now include the
swimwear and women's intimate apparel wholesale businesses acquired with
Warnaco. Refer to Appendix A later in this release for a further
discussion and the adjusted 2012 quarterly and annual revenue and
earnings before interest and taxes by segment.
First Quarter Business Review:
Due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2012, first quarter 2013 comparable store
sales are more appropriately compared with the thirteen week period
ended May 6, 2012. All comparable store sales discussed in this release
are presented on this shifted basis.
Calvin Klein
Revenue on a non-GAAP basis in the Calvin Klein business increased to
$638 million from $262 million in the prior year's first quarter. $361
million of the increase in revenue was due to the Warnaco acquisition
and is net of the reduction in licensing revenue attributable to Warnaco
for the prior year. Comparable store sales within the Company's Calvin
Klein North America retail business increased 4% despite unseasonably
cold weather in March and April. With respect to the Warnaco Calvin
Klein jeans and underwear businesses, revenue exceeded the Company's
estimate as a result of strong business in China and Brazil, due in part
to wholesale shipments planned in the second quarter being accelerated
into the first quarter, partially offset by continued weakness in Korea.
The European business was on plan with a mid-single digit sales decline
due to weakness in jeans, particularly in Spain and Italy where the
European business is primarily concentrated and where the Company is
currently restructuring the distribution mix. Comparable store sales
within the Calvin Klein International segment decreased 5%.
Royalty revenue in the first quarter decreased $22 million from the
prior year amount, principally due to the loss of royalties from Warnaco
subsequent to the acquisition date and the expiration of a long-term
contractual agreement related to royalties in the North American women's
sportswear business. Excluding the expiration of this contract and loss
of Warnaco royalties, royalty revenue increased 4% due to strength in
handbags and accessories, women's coats, outerwear and suits.
GAAP revenue in the current year's first quarter was $608 million, or
$30 million lower than non-GAAP revenue, due to the sales returns
mentioned above.
Earnings before interest and taxes for the Calvin Klein business
increased to $106 million on a non-GAAP basis, as compared to $58
million in the prior year's first quarter (which was in accordance with
GAAP), due largely to earnings related to the Calvin Klein businesses
acquired from Warnaco and a strong increase in the Company's North
America retail business due to the revenue increase mentioned above,
combined with improved gross margins.
On a GAAP basis, earnings before interest and taxes for the Calvin Klein
business decreased to a loss of $(36) million, as compared to earnings
of $58 million in the prior year's first quarter. This decrease was due
principally to the significant acquisition and integration costs
incurred during the first quarter, a significant portion of which was
non-cash, partially offset by the net earnings from the acquired
businesses noted above.
Tommy Hilfiger
Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger business increased 5% to $811 million from
$770 million in the prior year's first quarter. Within the Tommy
Hilfiger North America business, revenue increased 14%, principally
driven by a 5% retail comparable store sales increase, retail square
footage expansion and strong North America wholesale revenue growth. The
increase in the North America wholesale business was due, in part, to
the acceleration into the first quarter of wholesale shipments that were
initially planned for the second quarter. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger
International business was flat as compared to the prior year's first
quarter. Revenue growth in Europe was driven by a 4% retail comparable
store sales increase despite unseasonably cool weather, but was offset
by the negative impact of a weaker Yen and continued weakness in the
Company's Japanese business, where it continues to strategically
reposition the brand.
Earnings before interest and taxes for the Tommy Hilfiger business
increased 15% to $118 million from $103 million on a non-GAAP basis and
$102 million on a GAAP basis in the prior year's first quarter. The
North America business drove the increase as a result of the net revenue
growth discussed above and an improvement in gross margin resulting from
an increase in average unit retail selling prices and stronger sell
throughs.
Heritage Brands
Total revenue for the Heritage Brands business increased 24% to $491
million as compared to $395 million in the prior year's first quarter,
due principally to the addition of $126 million of revenue related to
Warnaco's Speedo swimwear and Warner's and Olga women's intimate apparel
businesses. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $28
million, or 7%, resulting from the 2012 exit from the Izod women's and
Timberland wholesale sportswear businesses. Excluding the impact of
exited businesses, revenue for the pre-existing Heritage Brands business
decreased 1%, principally driven by a 7% comparable store sales decline
due principally to the soft performance of the Company's Bass retail
business and unseasonably cool weather in the Northeast and Midwest,
partially offset by a strong increase in the Izod men's wholesale
sportswear business due, in part, to the timing of shipments.
Earnings before interest and taxes for the Heritage Brands business was
$39 million on a non-GAAP basis, as compared to the prior year's first
quarter of $18 million (which was in accordance with GAAP). The increase
was due principally to (i) the addition of earnings related to the
acquired Warnaco Heritage Brands businesses; and (ii) operating margin
expansion in the pre-existing wholesale business primarily driven by
strong gross margin improvement in the Izod men's, Van Heusen and Arrow
wholesale sportswear businesses, combined with exiting the lower-margin
Izod women's and Timberland wholesale sportswear businesses. Partially
offsetting these increases was a decline in the Bass retail business,
driven by the comparable store sales decline mentioned above, combined
with higher promotional selling across the Heritage Brands Retail
business, which pressured gross margins.
On a GAAP basis, earnings before interest and taxes for the Heritage
Brands business was $22 million, as compared to $18 million in the prior
year's first quarter. This increase was due principally to the revenue
and operating margin increases noted above, partially offset by Warnaco
acquisition and integration costs, a significant portion of which was
non-cash.
First Quarter Consolidated Earnings:
Earnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis increased 51% to
$241 million from $159 million in the prior year's first quarter due in
large part to the positive impact of the acquired Warnaco businesses.
The increase in earnings before interest and taxes on a non-GAAP basis
was driven by the net effect of (i) an increase of $48 million in the
Calvin Klein business; (ii) an increase of $15 million in the Tommy
Hilfiger business; (iii) an increase of $21 million in the Heritage
Brands business; and (iv) an increase of $3 million in corporate
expenses due principally to the addition of Warnaco corporate expenses,
net of synergies realized from the acquisition.
The Company posted earnings before interest and taxes on a GAAP basis of
$7 million, as compared to $156 million in the prior year's first
quarter. The decline in earnings was due principally to $235 million of
acquisition, integration, restructuring and debt modification and
extinguishment charges related to the Warnaco acquisition, partially
offset by the net effect of the changes discussed above. Acquisition,
integration, restructuring and debt modification and extinguishment
charges totaling $133 million were non-cash, the majority of which
relate to short-lived valuation adjustments and amortization.
Net interest expense increased to $45 million on a non-GAAP basis, as
compared to $29 million in the prior year's first quarter (which was in
accordance with GAAP), due to the debt incurred in connection with the
Warnaco acquisition, which increased the Company's total indebtedness
above the pre-acquisition level. GAAP net interest expense was $46
million.
The effective tax rate was 20.6% on a non-GAAP basis as compared to
24.8% on a non-GAAP basis in the prior year's first quarter. The
non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2013 was lower than
plan, which resulted in a favorable impact of $14 million, or $0.17 per
share, due to the timing of certain discrete tax items. Such discrete
items were also the reason for the decrease in the first quarter
non-GAAP tax rate as compared to the prior year's first quarter. On a
GAAP basis, the impact of the Warnaco acquisition on pre-tax income,
combined with certain discrete items recorded during the quarter,
resulted in the GAAP effective tax rate increasing to 48.9%, as compared
to 24.7% in the prior year's first quarter.
2013 Guidance:
Please see the section entitled “Full Year and Second Quarter
Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts” at the end of this release
for further detail and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts
discussed in this section.
Full Year Guidance
Despite the strong tone of business that led to the Company's
outperformance in the first quarter, the Company believes it is
premature to adjust its full year earnings guidance, given the short
amount of time that has passed since closing the Warnaco acquisition and
the complexity of the integration.
The Company continues to project that revenue in 2013 will be
approximately $8.2 billion.
Revenue for the Calvin Klein business in 2013 on a non-GAAP basis is
projected to increase to approximately $2.75 billion as compared to the
2012 amount of $1.15 billion, principally due to the Warnaco jeans and
underwear businesses. Revenue for the Tommy Hilfiger business in 2013 is
expected to be approximately $3.40 billion as compared to the 2012
amount of $3.22 billion. Revenue for the Heritage Brands business in
2013 is projected to increase to approximately $2.05 billion as compared
to the 2012 amount of $1.68 billion due principally to the addition of
revenue related to the newly acquired Speedo swimwear and Warner's and
Olga women's intimate apparel businesses.
The Company continues to project that non-GAAP earnings per share will
be approximately $7.00, as compared to the $6.58 in 2012.
The Company currently projects that 2013 interest expense will be
approximately $200 million and that the 2013 full year tax rate will be
approximately 25.5% to 26.5%. The Company currently plans to make term
loan payments of approximately $400 million during the remainder of
2013, the majority of which are expected to be voluntary.
The Company's 2013 earnings per share estimate excludes approximately
$450 million of pre-tax costs associated with the Warnaco acquisition
and the related integration, restructuring and debt modification and
extinguishment, of which approximately $225 million are expected to be
non-cash charges, the majority of which are expected to relate to
short-lived valuation adjustments and amortization. (Please see section
entitled “Non-GAAP Exclusions” for details on these pre-tax costs.)
Second Quarter Guidance
Revenue in the second quarter of 2013 is expected to be approximately
$1.9 billion.
Revenue for the Calvin Klein business in the second quarter of 2013 is
projected to increase to approximately $625 million as compared to the
2012 amount of $251 million principally due to the Warnaco jeans and
underwear businesses. Revenue for the Tommy Hilfiger business in the
second quarter of 2013 is expected to be approximately $775 million as
compared to the 2012 amount of $722 million. Revenue for the Heritage
Brands business in the second quarter of 2013 is projected to increase
to approximately $500 million as compared to the 2012 amount of $363
million due principally to the addition of revenue related to the newly
acquired Speedo swimwear and Warner's and Olga women's intimate apparel
businesses.
On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share for the second quarter is
currently projected to be approximately $1.35 as compared to $1.28 in
the prior year's second quarter.
The Company currently projects that second quarter 2013 interest expense
will be approximately $50 million and that the 2013 second quarter tax
rate will be approximately 30.0% to 31.0%.
The Company's second quarter 2013 earnings per share estimate excludes
approximately $125 million of pre-tax costs associated with the
integration and related restructuring of Warnaco, of which approximately
$75 million are expected to be non-cash charges, the majority of which
relate to short-lived valuation adjustments and amortization. (Please
see section entitled “Non-GAAP Exclusions” for details on these pre-tax
costs.)
CEO Comments:
Commenting on these results, Emanuel Chirico, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, noted, “We are very pleased with our first quarter
performance, which included our newly acquired Warnaco businesses and
significantly exceeded our guidance. Our results demonstrated the
strength of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses, which both
continue to exhibit strong global growth, despite the macro-environment
and unseasonably cold weather that negatively impacted sales of spring
product in North America and Europe. We were also pleased to see the
strong operating improvements in our pre-existing Heritage Brands
wholesale business, primarily in the sportswear division, and believe
the Speedo, Warner's and Olga brands are proving to
be strategic complements to our pre-existing Heritage Brands portfolio.”
Mr. Chirico continued, “During the first quarter, we began to make the
necessary investments to rebuild Warnaco's Calvin Klein jeanswear and
underwear businesses, which will allow us to capitalize on their
long-term growth opportunities. We are committed to successfully
executing on our previously announced initiatives, which include our
focus on upgrading the quality and product design of Calvin Klein
jeanswear, investing in marketing and merchandising, reducing excess
inventory levels, and restructuring the sales distribution mix for these
businesses in Europe and North America. Additionally, significant steps
are being taken to enhance the existing operating infrastructure and
fill key positions across the organization. The impact of these
initiatives will result in a more pronounced increase in expenses in the
second half of the year. Taking into account all of these initiatives
and that we are only four months into our acquisition, we believe it is
prudent to hold our full year non-GAAP earnings guidance at $7.00.”
Mr. Chirico concluded, “2013 will be a year of transition for PVH. We
are actively implementing our integration plans to build upon the
foundation of PVH around the world and pave the way for the continued
success of our businesses. We are optimistic that the expansion of our
brands globally and the sound execution of our business strategies will
continue to drive long-term growth and stockholder value.”
Non-GAAP Exclusions:
The discussions in this release that refer to non-GAAP amounts exclude
the following:
A revenue reduction of $30 million in the first quarter of 2013 due to
sales returns for certain Warnaco wholesale customers in Asia in
connection with an initiative to reduce excess inventory levels.
Pre-tax costs of approximately $450 million expected to be incurred in
2013 in connection with the acquisition, integration and related
restructuring of Warnaco, including costs associated with the
Company's debt modification and extinguishment and the sales returns
mentioned above, of which $235 million was incurred in the first
quarter and approximately $125 million is expected to be incurred in
the second quarter. Approximately $225 million of the acquisition,
integration and related restructuring charges expected to be incurred
in 2013 are non-cash charges, the majority of which are short-lived
valuation adjustments and amortization.
Pre-tax interest expense of $1 million incurred prior to the Warnaco
acquisition closing date related to the $700 million of senior notes
issued to fund the acquisition.
Pre-tax costs of $21 million incurred in 2012 principally in
connection with the integration of Tommy Hilfiger, and the related
restructuring, of which $3 million was incurred in the first quarter,
$5 million was incurred in the second quarter, $7 million was incurred
in the third quarter and $6 million was incurred in the fourth quarter.
Pre-tax costs of $43 million incurred in 2012 in connection with the
acquisition of Warnaco, of which $6 million was incurred in the third
quarter and $36 million was incurred in the fourth quarter.
A pre-tax expense of $28 million recorded in the fourth quarter of
2012 related to recognized actuarial losses on retirement plans.
Pre-tax interest expense of $4 million recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2012 related to $700 million of new senior notes, which were issued
during the fourth quarter to fund a portion of the purchase price for
Warnaco.
A tax benefit of $14 million in 2012 related to the recognition of
previously unrecognized net operating loss assets and tax credits, of
which $5 million was recorded in the third quarter and $9 million was
recorded in the fourth quarter.
Estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax costs, which
are based on the Company's assessment of deductibility. In making this
assessment, the Company evaluated each item that it has recorded as an
acquisition, integration, restructuring or debt modification and
extinguishment cost or actuarial loss on retirement plans immediately
recognized in earnings to determine if such cost is tax deductible,
and if so, in what jurisdiction the deduction would occur. All items
above were identified as either primarily tax deductible, with the tax
benefit taken at the statutory income tax rate of the local
jurisdiction, or as non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed
no tax benefit.
Please see Tables 1 through 8 and the sections entitled “Full Year and
Second Quarter Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts” and
“Appendix A” later in this release for reconciliations of GAAP to
non-GAAP amounts.

limitation, statements relating to the Company's acquisition of The
Warnaco Group, Inc. (“Warnaco”), are made pursuant to the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be
predicted with accuracy, and some of which might not be anticipated,
including, without limitation, the following: (i) the Company's plans,
strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions are subject to
change at any time at the discretion of the Company; (ii) in connection
with the acquisition of Warnaco, the Company borrowed significant
amounts, may be considered to be highly leveraged, and will have to use
a significant portion of its cash flows to service such indebtedness, as
a result of which the Company might not have sufficient funds to operate
its businesses in the manner it intends or has operated in the past;
(iii) the levels of sales of the Company's apparel, footwear and related
products, both to its wholesale customers and in its retail stores, the
levels of sales of the Company's licensees at wholesale and retail, and
the extent of discounts and promotional pricing in which the Company and
its licensees and other business partners are required to engage, all of
which can be affected by weather conditions, changes in the economy,
fuel prices, reductions in travel, fashion trends, consolidations,
repositionings and bankruptcies in the retail industries, repositionings
of brands by the Company's licensors and other factors; (iv) the
Company's plans and results of operations will be affected by the
Company's ability to manage its growth and inventory, including the
Company's ability to realize benefits from Warnaco; (v) the Company's
operations and results could be affected by quota restrictions and the
imposition of safeguard controls (which, among other things, could limit
the Company's ability to produce products in cost-effective countries
that have the labor and technical expertise needed), the availability
and cost of raw materials, the Company's ability to adjust timely to
changes in trade regulations and the migration and development of
manufacturers (which can affect where the Company's products can best be
produced), changes in available factory and shipping capacity, wage and
shipping cost escalation, and civil conflict, war or terrorist acts, the
threat of any of the foregoing, or political and labor instability in
any of the countries where the Company's or its licensees' or other
business partners' products are sold, produced or are planned to be sold
or produced; (vi) disease epidemics and health related concerns, which
could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw
materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected
areas, as well as reduced consumer traffic and purchasing, as consumers
become ill or limit or cease shopping in order to avoid exposure;
(vii) acquisitions and issues arising with acquisitions and proposed
transactions, including, without limitation, the ability to integrate an
acquired entity, such as Warnaco, into the Company with no substantial
adverse effect on the acquired entity's or the Company's existing
operations, employee relationships, vendor relationships, customer
relationships or financial performance; (viii) the failure of the
Company's licensees to market successfully licensed products or to
preserve the value of the Company's brands, or their misuse of the
Company's brands; and (ix) other risks and uncertainties indicated from
time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”).
This press release includes, and the conference call/webcast will
include, certain non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC
rules. A reconciliation of these measures is included in the financial
information later in this release, as well as in the Company's Current

forward-looking statement, including, without limitation, any estimate
regarding revenue or earnings, whether as a result of the receipt of new
information, future events or otherwise.

PVH CORP. Non-GAAP Measures (In
thousands, except per share data)
The Company believes presenting its results excluding (i) the costs
incurred in 2013 in connection with its acquisition and integration of
The Warnaco Group, Inc. (“Warnaco”) and the related restructuring; (ii)
the revenue and gross margin reduction due to sales returns for certain
Warnaco wholesale customers in Asia in connection with an initiative to
reduce excess inventory levels; (iii) the costs incurred in 2013 in
connection with the Company's debt modification and extinguishment; (iv)
the interest expense incurred prior to the Warnaco acquisition closing
date related to the $700 million of senior notes issued to fund the
acquisition; (v) the costs incurred in 2012 in connection with its
integration of Tommy Hilfiger and the related restructuring; and (vi)
the tax effects associated with these costs, which are on a non-GAAP
basis for each year, provides useful additional information to
investors. The Company excludes such amounts that it deems non-recurring
or non-operational and believes that this (i) facilitates comparing
current results against past and future results by eliminating amounts
that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting
management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based
on the ongoing operations of the Company and (ii) assists investors in
evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's operations and underlying
business trends in a manner that is consistent with management's
evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors
often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of
assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these
amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its
business with investment institutions, the Company's Board of Directors
and others. The Company's results excluding the costs above are also the
basis for certain incentive compensation calculations.
The following table presents the Company's non-GAAP measures that are
discussed in this release. Please see Tables 1 through 8 for
reconciliations of the GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts.

The estimated tax effects of the Company's acquisition,
integration, restructuring and debt modification and
extinguishment costs are based on the Company's assessment of
deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated
each item that it has recorded as an acquisition, integration,
restructuring and debt modification and extinguishment cost to
determine if such item is tax deductible, and if so, in what
jurisdiction the deduction would occur. All of the Company's
acquisition, integration, restructuring and debt modification and
extinguishment costs were identified as either primarily tax
deductible, with the tax benefit taken at the statutory income tax
rate of the local jurisdiction, or as non-deductible, in which
case the Company assumed no tax benefit.

PVH CORP. Full Year and Second Quarter
Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts
The Company is presenting its (1) 2013 estimated results excluding (a)
costs expected to be incurred in connection with its acquisition and
integration of Warnaco and the related restructuring; (b) the impact of
sales returns for certain Warnaco wholesale customers in Asia in
connection with an initiative to reduce excess inventory levels; (c) the
costs incurred in connection with the Company's debt modification and
extinguishment; (d) the interest expense incurred prior to the Warnaco
acquisition closing date related to the $700 million of senior notes
issued to fund the acquisition; (e) the actuarial loss expected to be
incurred on retirement plans; and (f) the estimated tax effects
associated with these costs, and (2) 2012 results excluding (a) costs
incurred in connection with its integration of Tommy Hilfiger and the
related restructuring; (b) costs incurred in connection with its
acquisition of Warnaco; (c) the interest expense incurred in connection
with the issuance of $700 million of senior notes related to its
acquisition of Warnaco; (d) the recognized actuarial loss on retirement
plans; (e) the tax effects associated with these costs; and (f) the tax
benefit resulting from the recognition of previously unrecognized net
operating loss assets and tax credits. Both the 2013 estimated results
and 2012 results are on a non-GAAP basis. The Company believes
presenting these results on a non-GAAP basis provides useful additional
information to investors. The Company excludes such amounts that it
deems non-recurring or non-operational and believes that this (i)
facilitates comparing current results against past and future results by
eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods,
thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to
make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company and (ii)
assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's
operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent
with management's evaluation of business performance. The Company has
provided the reconciliations set forth below to present its estimates on
a GAAP basis and excluding these amounts. The Company uses its results
excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to
discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company's Board
of Directors and others. The amounts referred to in clauses (1) and
(2)(a) through (2)(e) above are also excluded from earnings per share
calculations for purposes of incentive compensation awards. The
estimated tax effects associated with the above costs are based on the
Company's assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the
Company evaluated each item that it has recorded or expects to record as
an acquisition, integration, restructuring, debt modification or debt
extinguishment cost or actuarial loss on retirement plans to determine
if such cost is tax deductible, and if so, in what jurisdiction the
deduction would occur. All items above were identified as either
primarily tax deductible, with the tax benefit taken at the statutory
income tax rate of the local jurisdiction, or as non-deductible, in
which case the Company assumed no tax benefit.

The GAAP net income per common share amounts presented in the above

are not, and should not be construed to be, guidance for the Company's
2013 fiscal year. The Company's net income per common share, as well as
the amounts excluded in providing non-GAAP earnings guidance, would be
expected to change as a result of acquisition, restructuring, divestment
or similar transactions or activities, adjustments related to the
valuation of the purchase price for the Warnaco acquisition, the timing
and strategy of restructuring and integration initiatives or other
one-time events, if any, that the Company engages in or suffers during
the period or any market or other changes affecting the Company's
expected actuarial loss on retirement plans. Other than the Company's
acquisition of Warnaco, which closed on February 13, 2013, and the
related restructuring, the Company has no current understanding or
agreement regarding any such transaction or definitive plans regarding
any such activity.

PVH CORP. Appendix A
Change in Segment Presentation:
The acquisition of Warnaco has significantly impacted the way the
Company and its chief operating decision maker manage, analyze and
discuss its operating results. As such, the Company has changed its
reportable segments. The Company continues to aggregate its reportable
segments into three main businesses: Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and
Heritage Brands. However, the reportable segments comprising these
businesses are now as follows: (i) Calvin Klein consists of the
Company's Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International
reportable segments; (ii) Tommy Hilfiger consists of the Company's Tommy

In order to assist in understanding the Company's historical results for
2012 in the new segment format, the Company is furnishing the below
schedules, which present the Company's revenue and earnings before
interest and taxes by segment for 2012 for the second, third and fourth
quarter and full year. Revenue and earnings before interest and taxes by

format, are presented earlier in this release. While data for all
segments is presented below, there were no changes to the aggregate
results for any business. The only adjustments made to previously
presented prior year data relate to bifurcating the aggregate Calvin

When you're as gregarious and generous as Salah Bachir, Cineplex Media president, noted philanthropist and unstinting patron of the arts, where you live is bound to be as big as your heart. Take his Paris, Ont. country house, which was built in 1842 for the then-mayor of the town and boasts 21 rooms filled to the rafters with both contemporary art and Old World antiques.

The NHL memorandum of understanding has been signed, revenue sharing is in place and the mall in Glendale, Arizona, is saved! Four months of no hockey is a small price to pay for such a noble goal, Mr. Commissioner.Ahem. The NHL season gets underway Saturday with a Hockey Night In Canada tripleheader and coverage on NBC as well (one of a record 14 regular-season hits on the main network). It’s Ottawa vs. Winnipeg in the afternoon, Toronto vs. Montreal as the main event and Vancouver vs. Anaheim as the dessert.
