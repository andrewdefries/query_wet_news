What are we looking for?If January maintains its reputation as the trendsetter for the rest of the year, this could be a nasty one. Coming off a year that was both relatively stable and generally rewarding for stock investors, uncertainty has crept back into all corners of the market. Some emerging market economies are trying to stop currency runs, the loonie is in a tailspin, the Canadian economic outlook is darkening and the implications of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s slow withdrawal of monetary accommodation remains unclear.

Thrown out of the game for his hit in Mikael Granlund, Nazem Kadri watched helplessly as the Toronto Maple Leafs went through overtime and lost to the Minnesota Wild in a shootout.He figured that was punishment enough.Instead, the NHL suspended Kadri for the next three games for his other transgression, an elbow to the head of Wild goaltender Niklas Backstrom, putting the Leafs at a severe disadvantage without their top three centres.

Brace yourself: Based on what we know right now, the Wii, Xbox 360, and, to a lesser degree, PlayStation 3, are all set to have somewhat sterile years in terms of exclusive software.
All three hardware makers are in the process of readying new consoles, and it seems they’ve shifted their internal studios’ attention away from current-generation games and toward next-generation projects.
