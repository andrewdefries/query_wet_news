The family of Hassan Rasouli, a father of two hospitalized and on life support for the past three years, won a landmark victory at the Supreme Court of Canada denying doctors the power to unilaterally remove the breathing machine and feeding tubes keeping him alive.Two doctors at Toronto’s Sunnybrook Hospital contended that physicians would be forced to act against their obligation to do no harm if they maintained a biologically alive man in a state of living death.

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford is being called homophobic after he took exception to the flying of the rainbow flag at city hall during the Olympics, saying the games are about “being patriotic to your country” and not about “sexual preference.”Toronto’s controversial mayor caused a commotion Friday, demanding the flag come down less than an hour after it was raised on the ceremonial flag pole at city hall – a show of support being made by several Canadian cities for the LGBTQ community in light of Russia’s anti-gay laws.

Losing a job can be a traumatic experience. When my first contract role ended while working in Jerusalem in my early twenties, I quickly created new business cards, called myself a freelancer and started knocking on the doors of editors I met in the area. One asked where I currently worked and when I explained I was freelance, he retorted, “So, you’re unemployed.” The description stung.

How does it feel to be in the crosshairs of an escalating investigation into illegal insider trading? For a little-known group of firms that specialize in providing expertise, it is proving a distinctly uncomfortable experience.
A continuing probe by U.S. authorities is casting a harsh spotlight on the activities of “expert networks,” prompting their clients – mostly investment firms – to question their practices and in select cases, stop using their services.
To supporters, expert networks are the telephone utilities of the financial world, connecting investors seeking information with thousands of well-informed sources. In short order, they can arrange a private call with experts on anything from smart-phone sales to drug development to banking law.
To critics, however, the fast-growing field has long been a source of unease. Such networks provide a way for unscrupulous players to make a grab for confidential information, they say.
That’s exactly what troubles U.S. authorities. Last month they arrested an employee of an expert network firm, Primary Global Research, and charged him with conspiring to reveal non-public information, including earnings figures that hadn’t been disclosed. None of the allegations have been proved in court.
Federal authorities also raided three hedge funds and sought documents from other money managers, in some cases seeking details of their relationships with expert networks.
The chill on the industry was immediate. Several investors ended their relationship with Primary Global; one hedge fund, Balyasny Asset Management, said it stopped using expert networks altogether; still other funds wrote to their investors to assure them they weren’t connected with such firms.
With the probe still under way, further charges appear likely. The fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department are involved – raising the possibility of criminal, not civil charges – means “this is a very serious matter,” says one former regulator. “These aren’t borderline cases, this is hard-core stuff.”
Michael Mayhew, the founder of Integrity Research Associates LLC, which tracks expert networks, says that it’s important not to tar the entire industry just because there may have been a few bad actors. “This kind of research is really, really important because otherwise you’re relying on the honesty and transparency of managers of publicly traded companies,” he says.
Expert networks have flourished in the past decade as Wall Street firms cut back on their research operations and regulators pushed companies toward fuller disclosure of market-moving information. The field consists of roughly 40 firms which pull in about half-a-billion dollars (U.S.) in annual revenue, Mr. Mayhew says.
Investment firms pay the top expert networks up to $120,000 a year to access their sources for a given industry. The networks feature a dizzying array of experts, including doctors, lawyers, consultants, scientists, and scores of current and former executives. Gerson Lehrman Group, the largest such firm, has over 200,000 experts in its network. In exchange for sharing their expertise, they receive hourly fees.
These firms know there’s a potential for abuse. To control it, expert networks make their consultants pledge not to reveal anything confidential. Most also prohibit current employees from speaking about their own companies.
Yet despite considerable efforts to stamp out potential conflicts, some companies and executives remain wary. Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics, said an experience several years ago was enough to sour him on the industry. After joining a network, Mr. Whalen recalls being contacted by a young hedge fund trader who asked for non-public information about a particular bank, which he refused to provide. Since then, Mr. Whalen says he has turned down dozens of offers to sign up with expert networks.
