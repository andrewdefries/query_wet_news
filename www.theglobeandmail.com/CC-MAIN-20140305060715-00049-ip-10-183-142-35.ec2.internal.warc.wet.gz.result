Sometimes, I like the stocks I write about so much, I buy them for myself.This is the case with Western Digital Corp. and Seagate Technology, two makers of computer disk drives I recommended a year ago. They seemed absurdly cheap then, with price-to-earnings ratios in the low single digits.Since then, they have returned nearly 50 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. And they’re still cheap, particularly for the tech sector.
