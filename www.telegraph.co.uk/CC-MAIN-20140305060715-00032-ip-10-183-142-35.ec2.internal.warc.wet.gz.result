My dark night in the Land of the Rising Sun
It’s every expat’s nightmare – falling seriously ill in a foreign land. Yet, as Jeremy Hill explains, his spell in a Tokyo hospital made him glad to live there Jeremy Hill with his children Justin and Jemma, enjoying the cherry blossom in a Tokyo park shortly after his discharge from hospital Photo: Jeremy Hill	9:55AM BST 04 Oct 2013

"Your face looks funny. I’m going to call an ambulance," said my partner, Yukiko, as I lay on the sofa watching the latest Batman DVD one cold winter’s night in Tokyo, feeling very sorry for myself with a heavy head cold. "That’s strange,” I thought, "my face has been funny for the last 50 years and no one’s ever sent me to hospital before." But then again, the Japanese tend to go to hospital for minor ailments just as we would visit our GP in England. Perhaps this was just another of those cultural quirks that had been enriching my life in Japan for the previous three years. Soon afterwards, however, I was in an ambulance. Although my Japanese is not fluent I could understand them calling ahead to find an emergency bed for the foreigner with the funny face. Then it all got very fuzzy. When I came to, I was surrounded by nurses who were asking me to smile at them and squeeze their hands. "So there is a heaven," I thought. Then the doctors asked me to raise my arms in a banzai-type salute. My right arm made it but there was no movement in my left. It gradually dawned on me that I was in intensive care having suffered a serious stroke, and it was only the quick thinking and action by Yukiko and the medical experts that meant I regained consciousness as quickly as I did. I spent a month in the Toho University Hospital in central Tokyo, going through all manner of clinical tests and scans. The nurses struggling to lift me had also recommended a strict diet to reduce my weight to the Asian BMI standards. They didn’t understand that I wasn’t too heavy, I was just too short. They were also keen to add to their very limited English medical vocabulary for bodily functions, so I quickly taught them the words "pee" and "pooh" – possibly laying the foundations for my current post-retirement job as an English language coach.

Expat guide to Japan: health care
11 May 2011
As a foreigner, I was given the option of having bread with my nutritious Japanese meals of grilled fish, miso soup and broccoli; with hindsight, after a month of receiving a slab of white toast and catering-pack marmalade with every meal, I wished I’d chosen the bowl of rice. But being right-handed, using chopsticks to eat was a definite advantage while I still couldn’t move my left arm. Within a week I started daily physiotherapy or "rehabili". My rehab doctor was, like me, a music fan, so while he took me through my exercises we’d talk about our shared interest in British classic rock. I began to look forward to these sessions – instead of "one, two, three, and four" as I lurched along the parallel bars, it would be "Bowie, Clapton, Queen and Floyd". After a month I could walk with a stick and move small objects with my left hand, and was transferred to the Hatsudai rehabilitation hospital. There I did three to four hours’ intensive physical and occupational therapy every day with some "concentration" or "attentiveness" exercises and tests. It was a combination of Playschool and bootcamp. The physical trainers tried to give me instructions in simple English (stretch, relax, push, pull, up, down) but the occupational therapy was more of a challenge. Word association and mental maths may be standard brain training for stroke recovery, but in Japanese it really got my damaged grey cells active again. A key feature of the rehabilitation was to return to a normal life-style, so patients had their own rooms, dressed in everyday clothes and ate meals in a dining room with fellow patients. Conversations with my table mates, Nagai-san and Honda-san, again stretched my listening skills as they had both suffered speech impairment with their strokes, but with pictures and a lot of laughs we got on very well and still keep in touch. In the clear spring air from the dining room, we had a fantastic view of a snow-capped Mount Fuji rising from the distant horizon over the urban landscape – a real inspiration to reach for the heights. We were also encouraged to set some personal goals to facilitate recovery. Pre-stroke, a friend of mine had bought me a ticket to see Eric Clapton play at the Budokan arena and I was determined to go – so after protracted negotiations with the head of the hospital I got permission, with Yukiko pushing me in a wheelchair, though only after she'd had a few driving lessons. At the end of the concert, as Eric left the stage, I managed to raise my left arm completely – a slow-arm greeting for "Slowhand”. My next goal was to be able to run again. I got fitter with a lot of balance and co-ordination exercises, and was pleased to have my daily walk outside the hospital building increase from 10 to 30 minutes. I finally persuaded the staff who accompanied me to allow me to break into a jog on occasions – a wonderful sense of freedom. In the end they used to draw lots as to who didn’t have to go jogging with the crazy gaijin (foreigner). With regular assessments I looked forward to being discharged to achieve my third objective – to go to Narita airport unaided to meet my teenaged son and daughter who, not having given up faith in their old man, were going ahead with their planned Easter holiday visit to Japan. The fact that I made it was a physical and emotional breakthrough, even though navigating the crowds in the local park for a picnic lunch under the cherry blossoms remained a challenge. But it was a chance to reflect on how lucky I had been to have received such excellent medical care at the hands of the Japanese health service, following that dark night four months previously. Jeremy Hill, 56, who is originally from Northampton, England, spent 35 years working as a British diplomat. He was posted to Japan twice in his career and stayed there after he retired. He now works as an English language teacher and corporate trainer. Expat Life

Godfrey, CDA, U.S. Embassy - Tripoli, Dept of State. REASON: 1.4 (b)
1.(C) Summary: An unsuccessful year-long bid by U.S. firm Bechtel to build a commercial port in the Libyan city of Sirte has shed light on how decisions about large foreign investment projects in Libya are made. Bechtel's bid went through several evolutions, including signing a memorandum of understanding with the Prime Minister and a resolution by Libya's Cabinet-equivalent to give the company the contract. In the end, the contract evaporated after apparent late-innings intervention by senior regime figures. Despite a year's worth of effort, $1 million worth of expenses, numerous high-level visits, and formal decisions by the GOL to bless the contract, the company's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, underscoring the fact that Libya's much-trumpeted bidding process is less than transparent, and that the GOL's formal structures do not have the final word on major foreign investment projects. The fact that an operator with Bechtel's savvy and deep pockets was ultimately unable to secure its contract serves as a cautionary tale for the many U.S. and western companies seeking to enter Libya's booming market. End summary. PROMISING BEGINNINGS ... 2. (C) U.S. engineering and consulting giant Bechtel has just declared as dead a year-long attempt to secure a $1 billion cost-plus contract to build a commercial port in the Libyan city of Sirte. Bechtel began its pursuit of the Sirte port contract in July 2007, when senior Bechtel representative Charles Redman (strictly protect), former U.S. Ambassador to Germany, arrived in Tripoli for discussions at the invitation of the Qadhafi Development Foundation (QDF), a quasi-governmental entity headed by Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, son of Muammar al-Qadhafi. During the initial visit, QDF representatives encouraged Bechtel to bid on several small infrastructure projects so the company could "prove itself". Redman made it clear that Bechtel wanted, but did not need, business in Libya and had a record that spoke for itself. Eventually, QDF representatives invited Bechtel to execute two projects: a new commercial port facility at Sirte and management of an industrial city adjacent to the Ras Lanuf oil facility. The QDF proposed that Bechtel partner with the Libyan Economic and Social Development Fund (ESDF) to execute the Sirte Port project. 3.(C) This initial burst of positive energy dissipated over the next six months. Bechtel slowly made progress on a contract for the Sirte port project, but its relationship with General People's Committee (GPC) for Transportation, its primary interlocutor on the deal (apart from the QDF), became increasingly difficult. This primarily manifested itself in a lack of responsiveness on facilitation of visas for Bechtel representatives, prompting Bechtel to seek support from other quarters of the Government of Libya (GOL) to facilitate travel by its negotiators and technical staff. In November 2007, then Deputy Foreign Minister Muhammed Siala remarked publicly during a visit to Washington that Bechtel would not secure the Sirte port contract if Secretary Rice failed to visit Libya by year's end. LEAD TO HIGH-PROFILE COMMITMENTS 4.(C) After months of go-slow negotiations, Bechtel experienced an apparent breakthrough in February, when Redman received an urgent call from Minister of Transportation Elmabruk, who asked that the company's team be in Sirte on February 25 to "sign the contract". Although the company was still in the midst of conducting a laborious due diligence review of the contract (key provisions of which had not been finalized), they were convinced to rush a delegation to Sirte in time for a signing event. At that event, Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi and Bechtel signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) committing the two sides to finalizing the contract as soon as possible. In addition, the General People's Committee (Cabinet-equivalent) issued Decision #158 on March 3, which was effectively an announcement of contract terms that granted permission to the GPC for Transportation to sign a contract with Bechtel. Following these public steps by the GOL, Bechtel reported that the GPC for Transportation appeared to be working in earnest to finalize an English-language version of the contract. RADIO SILENCE BROKEN BY BAD NEWS FROM SAIF AL-ISLAM'S INTERMEDIARY TRIPOLI 00000595 002 OF 002 5.(C) With expectations running high that a final deal was imminent, Bechtel pressed on with negotiations and a fully-vetted contract was presented to the Transportation Minister in early May. From that point on, all communication with the QDF, GPC for Transportation and Libyan Ports Authority (another key player in the deal) went dead. Sensing that something was amiss, Bechtel representatives continued to inquire about that status of the contract, but received no response. On July 14, Abdulhakim el-Ghami, described as "an intermediary for a person very close to Saif al-Islam", called Redman to inform him that the port project had been canceled. (Note: Redman told us el-Ghami, who is based in Munich, appears to be a key conduit for Saif al-Islam's dealings with foreign companies. End note.) Bechtel received no explanation as to why the contract was cancelled, but el-Ghami encouraged the company to "seriously consider" undertaking a different, unspecified infrastructure development project. 6.(C) Comment: Bechtel's experience throws into stark relief the fact that economic and commercial decisions ostensibly finalized by even the most senior levels of the GOL can be overturned by influential elements operating outside the formal government structure. Libyan officials have made much of recent measures designed to ensure transparency and predictability in bids for commercial contracts; however, the reality is that contracts of any size, particularly those involving foreign companies, are subject to intense maneuvering by regime insiders jockeying to ensure that they company they happen to champion wins the prize. Bechtel's story also reinforces post's understanding of Saif al-Islam's key as a principal gatekeeper for large foreign investment projects in Libya, a process he manages through the QDF and the National Engineering Services and Supply Company (NESSCO - further details will be reported septel). The silver lining in this tale of woe is that Bechtel's power division has been awarded a project management job for construction of a new power plant outside Sirte; however, the sorry denouement of the company's efforts to secure the Sirte port contract have dampened its for seeking any new major projects in Libya in the near future and should serve as a cautionary tale for other U.S. companies considering major investment projects here. .

Iraq withdrawal: background to the war The Iraq war sharply divided opinion over whether ousting Saddam Hussein's brutal regime justified the enormous human and financial cost. Link to this video
10:00AM BST 30 Apr 2009
British forces invaded Iraq in March 2003 under a cloud of political controversy about the legality of military action and amid intense public opposition to the conflict.After an initial honeymoon period when many Iraqis welcomed them as liberators, British troops found themselves mired in a vicious Iran-backed Shiite insurgency.But after more than six years in the country - longer than the duration of the Second World War - they are now returning home leaving southern Iraq a more peaceful and optimistic place.The security situation in the city of Basra is greatly improved, although rebuilding shattered homes and ensuring everyone has access to clean water and electricity will take much longer.Historians will debate the political and military rights and wrongs of the Iraq war for many decades to come.

British campaign in Iraq comes to official end
30 Apr 2009
Nick Clegg, the Libderal Democrat leader, has suggested it was Britain's "most disastrous foreign policy blunder" since the Suez crisis more than 50 years ago.The Falklands War had a significantly higher UK death toll, but the drawn-out battle in Iraq against an often invisible enemy put a huge strain on the troops.A total of 179 British personnel - 178 servicemen and women and one civilian Ministry of Defence worker - died serving in the Iraq campaign.Among the worst losses of life were the murder of six Red Caps by an angry mob in June 2003 and the deaths of 10 personnel when an RAF Hercules was shot down near Baghdad in January 2005.Both incidents led to embarrassing questions for ministers about how well British servicemen and women were equipped before being sent off to war.There was further controversy about a number of prisoner abuse scandals involving British troops - isolated incidents, as the military stressed, but very damaging.A public inquiry later this year will examine the case of Baha Mousa, a 26-year-old hotel receptionist in Basra who was beaten to death in September 2003 while in the custody of British soldiers.But it should not be forgotten that Britain's forces also demonstrated great stoicism and heroism while serving in Iraq.This was exemplified by Private Johnson Beharry, who became the first person to be awarded the Victoria Cross in more than two decades for his extraordinary bravery during two fierce ambushes in the southern city of Al Amarah in May and June 2004.British generals acknowledge the campaign has been extremely difficult but say they are leaving Basra a much better place.Major General Andy Salmon, until last month the UK's top commander in Iraq, said in a recent interview: "I can put my hand on my heart and say we've finished this right."Nonetheless the UK - which also occupied Iraq during both World Wars - leaves behind a mixed legacy.People in Basra are grateful to be free from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein's rule but some blame the foreign troops for the troubles that have beset their country since 2003.A recent survey found that only 36 per cent of Iraqis believed the presence of British forces had been positive and 42% felt it was negative.Now the UK pullout brings Iraq a step closer to taking control of its own destiny.

Ammonia leaks from International Space Station
The International Space Station suffered a small leak of ammonia used to cool its power system on Thursday, but there was no danger to the crew, NASA said.

Comments
The US space agency said crew had spotted small white flakes floating away from an area outside the craft before reporting the incident to Mission Control in Houston.
NASA said in a bulletin on its website that while the rate of ammonia leaking from the station's truss structure had increased, the "station continues to operate normally otherwise and the crew is in no danger."
"Ammonia is used to cool the station's power channels that provide electricity to station systems," NASA said, revealing that the leak was coming from the same general area it did in a previous episode last year.
"This ammonia loop is the same one that spacewalkers attempted to troubleshoot a leak on during a spacewalk on Nov 1, 2012," the statement said.
"It is not yet known whether this increased ammonia flow is from the same leak, which at the time, was not visible."

The ISS is currently crewed by six staff, under the command of Canadian Chris Hadfield.
Twitter: Chris Hadfield - Station's power relies on ammonia coolant. A few hours ago, we determined that the ammonia was leaking out of the Station and into space.
Twitter: Chris Hadfield - It is a serious situation, but between crew and experts on the ground, it appears to have been stabilized. Tomorrow we find out for certain.
