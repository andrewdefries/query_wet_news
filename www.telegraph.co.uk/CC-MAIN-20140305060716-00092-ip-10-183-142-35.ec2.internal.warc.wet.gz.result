No constitutional bar to royal remarriage
12:00AM BST 17 Aug 2001
Comments
SIR - Boris Johnson writes that Mrs Parker Bowles "doesn't have to be Princess of Wales, any more than she has, eventually, to be Queen of Tonga". While a member of the Commonwealth, the Kingdom of Tonga has its own head of state.
King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV and Queen Halaevalu Mata'aho are well and still very much loved and respected by their people.

Serena Davies takes a look at some rockers who've crossed the great divide into classical music
Elvis Costello
Going through a classical phase in the early ‘90s, Elvis Costello fell in love with the Brodsky Quartet, self-proclaimed mavericks who favour Issey Miyake outfits over the stiffer black-tie garb with which we normally associate classical musicians. Determined to work with the Brodskys, Costello, a self-taught musician, learnt how to read and write music. The result was The Juliet Letters, a set of “chamber pop” songs inspired by the letters written by an eccentric academic who had taken it upon himself to reply to those addressed to Juliet — of Romeo and Juliet — and sent to Verona. The cycle met with considerable success, it became Costello’s highest-selling commercial record at the time. Paul McCartney Related Articles
Mozart, Beethoven and Jenkins
27 Apr 2004
In the most prestigious of pop/ classical crossovers, Paul McCartney was invited in 1991 by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra to compose an oratorio celebrating its 150th anniversary. Carl Davis conducted, soloists included Kiri Te Kanawa, and it premièred at Liverpool’s Anglican Cathedral to a five-minute standing ovation. Another self-taught musician, Macca had to get Davis to help with the orchestration, and the result, Liverpool Oratorio, a 90-minute meditation on the life of a Liverpudlian named Shanty, was not to everyone’s taste. Classical music pundits greeted it with derision. Steve Hackett
Ex-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett turned to Evelyn Glennie, the world’s only superstar percussionist, to give him classical credibility for a composition they performed together at 2002’s percussion and drumming festival at the Royal Festival Hall. The City in the Sea was described by one reviewer as “improvised belligerence and mournful doodling”, and involved wailing sounds and an organ impression coming from Hackett’s guitar, while Glennie played various homemade instruments, a drum kit and an air raid siren. His other classical offering is the more melodic A Midsummer Night’s Dream, a 1997 recording of instrumental music in the English pastoral tradition. A coherent if un-ambitious piece of writing, it yet suggests the gulf between pop and classical is bridgeable. Tony Banks
Solo success has persistently eluded Tony Banks, sometime Genesis keyboardist, and Seven looks unlikely to rock that boat. It was released in February on Naxos, a label usually considered a model of good, classical taste, and consists of seven suites, performed by the London Philharmonic. Banks, like McCartney, discovered he did not actually know how to write for an orchestra, so he had to get someone else to orchestrate, which lays his work open to instant criticism from the purists and accounts for something of its bland arrangement. Seven is at best serviceable film music. Jaz Coleman
Killing Joke lead singer Jaz Coleman is a workaholic polymath responsible for a positive ecstasy of classical/pop hybrid called Riders on the Storm: The Doors Concerto, an arrangement of Doors music for symphony orchestra recorded in 2000 with violinist Nigel Kennedy performing (on his violin) as the voice of Jim Morrison. Reasonably effective, it came as Coleman’s solo follow-up to a similar treatment he’d given songs by the Who and the Stones. Despite one reviewer’s describing Coleman as “our new Mahler”, it is likely that history will reflect on his frequent collaborations with Sarah Brightman before recording such an effusive judgement on his classical prowess in general, although there’s hope yet for a man who bought his first record, Russian Orchestral Masterpieces, at the age of six.

GCSEs to match toughest exams
GCSEs will go back to basics with tough new subject content, the reintroduction of end-of-course exams and the abolition of coursework as part of a Coalition plan to inject “desperately-needed rigour” into the education system. GCSEs will be subjected to major reforms after David Cameron insisted that tests had been undermined by "grade inflation". Photo: ALAMY	By Graeme Paton, Education Editor
10:00PM BST 10 Jun 2013
Comments
A sweeping overhaul of qualifications taken by 16-year-olds will be unveiled on Tuesday in a move designed to make exams comparable with the toughest tests sat elsewhere in the world. In a series of changes, ministers will announce that pupils will study whole Shakespeare plays in English instead of short extracts, at least one 19th century novel, a selection of Romantic poetry and seminal world literature. Maths courses will feature more advanced algebra and statistics, biology syllabuses will place a greater emphasis on evolution and genetics and pupils will be set challenging mechanics problems in physics. Foreign languages will also involve more questions focused on advanced grammatical rules and translation and pupils will be expected to write longer essay-style answers in history exams, it is revealed. The proposals will be outlined in a number of GCSE subject specification documents drawn up by the Department for Education with input from leading academics. Related Articles

MPs warn of repeat of GCSE English grading fiasco
11 Jun 2013
Government sources said the syllabuses – taught in England from September 2015 – would be similar to O-level courses sat by pupils in Singapore.
At the same time, Ofqual, the exams watchdog, will also publish a separate consultation paper outlining major changes to the structure of GCSEs, which are sat by almost 600,000 children a year.
It follows claims made by David Cameron on Monday that “grade inflation” had “robbed our qualifications of rigour and respect”. Under the last Government, the number of exams awarded an elite A* doubled from 3.6 to 7.5 per cent while A grades increased from 14 to 22.6 per cent, despite British pupils dropping down international league tables. In a speech, the Prime Minister said the education establishment had become “increasingly comfortable with failure”, adding: “That is why – despite fierce opposition – we are pushing change through, injecting desperately-needed rigour into the system, into what children learn and how they’re tested.” The Ofqual consultation will recommend:
• Assessing pupils entirely through an end-of-course exam taken after two years – abolishing the “modular” system in which courses are broken down into bite-sized chunks; • Axing current "tiered" papers aimed at low and high-ability pupils, with all children sitting the same exam, possibly with the exception of maths and science;
• Making GCSEs entirely free of coursework other than in science where practical assessments will be retained;
• Scrapping the existing A* to G grading system in favour of a numerical marking scale from 1 to 8, with 8 being the top score. Government sources insisted the change to grades was made to avoid straight comparisons with existing GCSEs and not to enable examiners to add grades 9 and 10 when large numbers of pupils reach the top mark in the future. It is also understood that the qualifications are likely to retain the GCSE title and not be dubbed “I-levels” in line with a leaked report last week. They may be renamed GCSEs (England) to differentiate them from separate exams taken in Wales and Northern Ireland. Ministers are also planning to ask 1,000 pupils a year to sit a new “sample test” in English and maths – without school-level results being published in league tables. Results would then be compared to GCSE scores to check that grades in the latter were not being subject to inflation. The changes will be announced as a major report by a cross-party group of MPs – published today – revealed that the GCSE grading fiasco of last summer was largely down to changes made by the last Labour government. The Education Select Committee warned that the shift towards more coursework and a modular system created instability in the system, adding that concerns raised by exam boards “were not acted upon” at the time.
A senior DfE source said: “We are reversing the devaluation of the exam system that Labour and the unions encouraged. “GCSEs will again be exams at the end of two years instead of being broken up into low quality modules. Coursework, corrupted by cheating, will be limited. “Exams will test higher level skills – such as more essay writing, problem-solving and mathematical modelling – that universities and businesses desperately need.”

Real wage growth needs more productive workers
Britain's poor productivity must be tackled if 2014 is to become the year that pay rises catch up with price increases, according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD).

Britain's poor productivity must be tackled if 2014 is to become the year that pay rises catch up with price increases, according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD).
Mark Beatson, chief economist at the human resources organisation, said that while what he termed the country’s “enigma” of strong job creation despite muted economic performance has now been solved with recent strong economic growth, a new challenge faces industry in the form of low productivity.
“This time last year we were talking about the UK’s 'jobs enigma’. Since then, labour market performance has continued to exceed expectations, turning the UK labour market into a 'jobs machine’.
“Employment growth looks set to continue at an impressive rate over the year to come. However, the downside is that UK productivity has yet to improve and remains below its pre-recession level.”
Employment growth looks set to continue through 2014, with even upwards-revised Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts of increases in employment and falls in unemployment looking conservative, Mr Beatson said.

Unless productivity increases, this recovery could end very badly
19 Dec 2013
However, with employment now having exceeded expectations for two consecutive years, he warns that 2014 needs to be a “year of productivity” if we are to see wages rising faster than prices.
“A lot of attention is being given to falling real wages and the UK’s 'cost of living crisis’, for understandable reasons. But not enough attention is given to the main reason why this has happened – that productivity has fallen since 2008,” he said.
“Skills shortages in certain sectors may inflate wages for some, but if we are to create any realistic prospect of wages rising in real terms across the board, we need to improve productivity. Central to this is business and government acting together to improve the way people are managed, with more emphasis on working smarter and creating value.
“This involves tackling the crisis of trust in many organisations, as well as developing better ways of valuing and making active use of the skills and talents of our workforce.”
Mr Beatson added: “While 2012 and 2013 were years when employment exceeded expectations, if both UK competitiveness and real wages are to increase then 2014 needs to be a year in which productivity exceeds expectations.”

Equitable Life compensation payments to begin
Investors who lost money with Equitable Life are to start receiving compensation next month, the Government has announced. The Equitable Life compensation scheme will aim to contact all eligible policyholders before June 2012 By Richard Evans
1:54PM BST 16 May 2011
Follow Comments
Older policyholders, those receiving with-profits annuities and the estates of victims who have died will be given priority. Of these groups, only the annuitants will be compensated in full – payments to the other investors will amount to less than a quarter of the amount lost. In all, Equitable Life victims will receive about £1.5bn. Mark Hoban, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said the compensation scheme had been designed to reflect "the principles of fairness, transparency and simplicity". The scheme will aim to contact all eligible policyholders before June 2012, regardless of whether they will receive a payment. Policyholders will be sent a statement explaining the value of any payment and details on when they can expect to receive it. The compensation, which is tax-free, will not be means-tested and will not affect eligibility for tax credits, but could be taken into account when other state benefits are calculated. Anyone reckoned to be eligible for compensation of less than £10 will not receive a payment. Related Articles

Equitable Life: Government finally says 'sorry' to policyholders
16 Jan 2009
The Treasury said payments could be brought forward on the grounds of hardship "regardless of circumstances". Mr Hoban added: "Having spent a great deal of time in dialogue with interested parties, the Government is now approaching the final stages of preparation before the [compensation] scheme begins to make payments to policyholders. "The Government's ambition is for these payments to begin before the end of June."
National Savings & Investments (NS&I), the Government's savings arm, is to administer the scheme. Policyholders do not need to take action at this stage, the Treasury said. The Equitable Members' Action Group expressed "outrage" at what it called "payment delays". "A million victims will be in the dark for yet another year," it said.

High cost of fuel forcing drivers to cut trips Most motorists are suffering because of soaring fuel prices, says a new report. But those living in the countryside are worst-hit of all.
Has the price of fuel made you think twice about using your car? Photo: CHRISTOPHER PLEDGER	By David Williams

Comments
Almost half of Britain's motorists have been forced to cut back on car journeys because of soaring fuel prices, a new report reveals.
Rural motorists are worst-hit, with almost one third of those living in the countryside saying they will have to cut down further on trips to family members if motoring costs increase again.
Other findings in the RAC Report on Motoring 2011 are that rural motorists are nearly twice as reliant on their cars when it comes to visiting family and friends compared with drivers in urban locations. This is backed by findings showing that for 30 per cent of rural drivers, the nearest bus stop or train station is too far away to be convenient, compared with just three per cent of urban dwellers facing the same problem.
The report says that the financial impact is set to worsen, leaving people who rely on their car feeling "isolated as they can no longer afford their social lives or carry out family commitments". Rising fuel prices are particularly alarming for the 60 per cent of rural motorists who rely on their cars to transport children to school and social activities, and the 39 per cent of urban motorists who do so.
"This year's Report on Motoring shows the tough choices being made by many motorists, with rural drivers hit the hardest as they have little alternative but to use their cars," said Adrian Tink, RAC motoring strategist. "People's ability to live their lives and do the most basic of tasks, such as visit family and take their children to after-school activities, is being threatened – and it looks like it's only going to get worse."

Added Mr Tink: "UK drivers want action from the Government. They already pay the highest duty and tax on fuel in Europe. At the very least, we are calling for fuel duty to be frozen and scheduled inflationary rises to be scrapped. In addition the Government should look again at the fair fuel stabiliser so that increased revenue from high oil prices can be passed back to drivers."
The report shows that nearly one in 10 motorists has already had to give up driving children to school or social activities, with 24 per cent expecting they will have to. Three per cent have given up trips involving family commitments, with 27 per cent fearing they will have to, while seven per cent have stopped driving to work and cut down on social trips and four per cent have cut car trips for food and "essentials".
The RAC Report says rural motorists now feel "backed into a corner", with 64 per cent saying it would be very difficult to adjust their lifestyles to being without a car compared with 36 per cent of urban motorists. Yet 65 per cent of drivers say they will have to "severely reduce" their car usage.

Poll shows more support for abandoning gay marriage plans rather than plain packaging
The Government has come under further pressure to drop its gay marriage plans after a new poll showed more people wanted them scrapped than the scheme to ensure cigarettes are sold in plain packaging, which was recently kicked into the long grass. Gay marriage is set to become law after clearing the House of Lords. Photo: ALAMY	6:47AM BST 08 May 2013
Ministers have recently cooled on the proposals to force tobacco firms to sell their products in such packets and the plans are unlikely to feature in this week's Queen’s Speech. However, the Government has indicated it will continue with its same sex marriage legislation. The ComRes poll, for the Coalition For Marriage (C4M), the campaign group set up to oppose the proposals, involved asking 2,000 adults which of the two policies they would prefer to see abandoned. Just over a third (34 per cent) opted for gay marriage, compared with 28 per cent, who wanted plain packaging plans scrapped. The remainder opted for “neither” or said they did not know. Among those who voted Conservative at the last general election, 46 per cent wanted same sex marriage legislation dropped, compared with 22 per cent who would rather see the tobacco plans abandoned.

Lord Carey tells Cameron: stop treating grassroots like 'dinosaurs'
09 May 2013
Colin Hart, campaign director for C4M, said: “This poll yet again shows how out of touch David Cameron is with his own party and the public at large. “The Prime Minister still remains determined to force through this undemocratic and unpopular legislation, which has never been voted upon by the electorate and which contributed to the disastrous local election results. “Poll after poll has found that this issue could cost the Conservatives more than a million votes and the next general election.”
The plain packaging proposals were first outlined by Andrew Lansley, the former Health Secretary, last year. Health campaigners argue it would discourage young people from taking up smoking. The Government’s consultation on plain packaging closed in August, but it is yet to publish a report on it. It is now understood the policy has been kicked into the long grass, although a Department of Health spokesman insisted that the Government maintained an “open mind” on the issue. Politics

Leaflets sent to 25,000 homes in rape inquiry
By John Steele
12:00AM BST 27 Oct 2000
A LEAFLET inviting women to consider whether someone they know is a serial rapist has been distributed to 25,000 homes by police hunting a man suspected of 14 attacks over the last decade.
Avon and Somerset police has distributed the leaflets as part of Operation Eagle to catch the man who has attacked 13 women in Bath and another in the Kingswood area of Bristol.
Nicknamed the "Batman Rapist" after he left a Batman baseball cap at the scene of one attack, he has raped five women, tried to rape another and to abduct seven more since 1991.
He targets lone women who have returned to their cars. He often threatens them with a knife and forces his way into their vehicles. The victims have been driven to secluded areas where they have been raped.
Police, investigating 14 attacks over the last nine years, say that one of his characteristic acts is to force the woman to wear tights, which he rips during the assault.

They said yesterday: "This is a dangerous and violent man who has attacked all types of women, of all ages. He frequently asks for money, but his motive is clearly rape and he rarely actually steals."
The man is thought to know Bath well because he takes his victims along a number of back roads. He tends to strike during dark winter nights and the latest appeal has been timed to coincide with the end of British Summer Time. Avon and Somerset police said the leaflet-drop was the biggest in the history of British criminal investigation. They want women to complete a checklist of questions about a friend, acquaintance, neighbour or relative.
To fit the profile, they must be able to tick the boxes suggesting he is:
a white male; of slim or medium build; aged between 30 and 50; knows the Bath area well, and has some connection with Bristol, particularly the Kingswood area, and can drive a car. The leaflet also suggests that women must be able to tick yes to two of these three descriptions: he has a tights fetish and he could get his sexual partner to wear tights which he may rip during intercourse; he sometimes wears a baseball cap; he has aroused suspicion with absences from home during the evening and early hours of the morning. The man last struck in May this year, after a 15-month gap. He tried to drag a 26-year-old woman from her car in Bath while her seven-year-old daughter slept in the back. Det Insp Paul James, who leads the 20-strong team of detectives, said: "This man must not have the chance to strike again. Women in Bath must be able to walk the streets in the knowledge that he has been caught." UK News

Worldwide: Harassed women fight back in groper's paradise
By Philip Delves Broughton in Rabat
12:01AM BST 17 Aug 2002
Morocco's street-side predators, like Kentucky's Colonel Sanders, are mostly leg and thigh men. A woman in a tight T-shirt will attract double takes and murmurs, but a short skirt and flash of leg will prompt pursuit, indecent proposals and often a furtive squeeze. You would have thought that an ambitious country, keen to attract tourists, would be doing something about its reputation as a groper's paradise. But no. On the basis of two hours in Rabat's Old City and conversations with Moroccan women and tourists, Moroccan men remain as persistent as ever, wolf-whistling, bottom-pinching and goatishly profferring themselves to passing women. They will often just sidle up and start whispering dirty nothings in their target's ear until she runs away. It is a fact of life mentioned in every guide book and an embarrassment for a country so desperate to be taken seriously in the world. The bottom-squeezers are to Morocco what football hooligans have been to Britain. For Moroccan women it is just as much of a problem as it is for tourists passing through Agadir in their holiday crop tops. Laws exist to punish men for sexual harassment, but they are tilted heavily against the victim, who must provide photographs or at least two witnesses to the incident. The high burden of proof dissuades many women from complaining.

Policemen often stand by laughing while their friends bay like coyotes at a woman walking by. They see it perhaps as part of the great pageant of street life which, if you are a randy young Moroccan man, of course it is. The reasons for Morocco's failure to stop it are the same as those hindering the country from development on other fronts. It has yet to find a way to reconcile its desire for modernity with Islamic tradition, which as interpreted by Morocco's vocal fundamentalists sees improving rights for women as an affront to men. Lamia Bouzbouz, a journalist for Liberation, a newspaper representing the majority party in the current government, has been among those pleading for change. "Sexual harassment has become a fun little game for many men, a practice so common in our daily life that it has become banal," she wrote recently. "I decided to write this because I have been a victim so often myself," she said from her office in Casablanca. "The level of proof a woman needs is insulting, and it becomes even more serious when the abuse turns physical." But she does not predict any change for at least 10 years. Unlike women in many other Islamic countries, Morocco's are well organised. There are dozens of women's groups. They are learning how to put pressure on the government and the king. In next month's legislative elections, the king has ruled, 10 per cent of those elected must be women. Mohammed VI, 34, is proving more considerate to women than his father, King Hassan II. His marriage last month was remarkable in that his wife appeared in public, a break from the tradition under which wives stay firmly in the shadows. He also seems determined to heed calls for changes to the Moudawana, a body of marriage and property law drafted in 1957 after Moroccan independence, which mixes local tradition and Islamic Sharia law. It is hugely disadvantageous to women and empowering for men. It dictates that all women need permission from a male guardian to marry. It limits their ability to leave their husbands, gives them almost no property rights or access to their children if their husband decides to divorce, and turns them essentially into marital slaves. A government committee was appointed in 1999 to examine changes to the Moudawana, including granting the first wife the right of veto over her husband taking more wives, raising the legal age of marriage from 15 to 18 and making judges the final arbiters in divorces. But street protests by fundamentalists rocked the government back, forcing the king to put together his own committee, which has yet to report. Morocco

Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai to step down as president in 2014
Afghan President Hamid Karzai says his country will have a new leader in 2014, and thanks the US for helping to overthrow the Taliban. 10:09AM GMT 12 Jan 2013
"In a year and few months from today, I'll be a retired president," Karzai said during a speech at Georgetown University in Washington DC. He outlined a bright future for his country over the next ten years, pointing to improvements in education, infrastructure and security. He thanked the United States for its role in Afghanistan since overthrowing the Taliban in 2001. "Definitely Afghanistan will remember that it was the US assistance that brought so much to Afghanistan," Karzai said. "We will forget the less pleasant aspects of our relationship. We will move forward in the gratitude of the help that the United States has provided to Afghanistan and also our other neighbours."

US election: Democrats in a sweat about Ohio By some accounts, this incredibly close US election race is getting even tighter at the very closing stages, and despite Obama's swing state leads, it could go either way. US Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney holds a rally in Columbus, Ohio Photo: EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images	By Alex Spillius
12:59PM GMT 06 Nov 2012
Follow Follow our US Election coverage as Mitt Romney and Barack Obama fight it out to become President. A Democrat in Washington close to the Obama camp reveals that the campaign's own polls in Ohio are even tighter than the public polls, which give the president an average lead of 2.8 per cent. "They are very nervous, we are all very nervous," he says. "On a scale of 1 to 10 of certainty of winning, I am at six and a half, and no better." Who will win the US presidential election?

Obama and Romney tie in first vote count
06 Nov 2012
Stephanie Cutter, Obama's deputy campaign manager, admits that Pennsylvania has "tightened", which is what politicos tend to say when they are getting worried about a race. According to the Daily Mail Online, Romney's in-house pollster Neil Newhouse finds the Republican is leading by a point in Ohio, two in Iowa, three in New Hampshire and is level in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. If those numbers are accurate, Romney would almost stroll into the White House. Even allowing for an element of spin, there could be a decisive late shift to Romney, driven by enthusiasm among Republicans and disillusion among Democrats. Obama's aides know very well how polls can fail to reflect the views of late-deciding voters. In 2008 polls in New Hampshire showed the ingenue senator cruising to victory over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary, only for the former First Lady to win by two points as last minute voters moved her way. Such an aberration across five, six or more states today seems less likely; Newhouse's numbers moreover contrast with all the final polls in the swing states, which a majority of which put the president narrowly ahead. At this stage, or at any stage of the race really, there are polls and there are hunches. "Any pollster who says 'this is how it's going to turn out' is crazy," says Andrew Smith, who conducts the University of New Hampshire's polling. His last poll, issued yesterday, has Obama up by three points in the state. But, he says, that slender lead could be overwhelmed by superior Romney turnout today. With the race so close, the get-out-the-vote operations of each campaign will be critical. The Obama machine is the more sophisticated, but Romney's is the most advanced the Republican Party has ever seen and could even out the difference. The Republicans have an advantage in that the groups less likely to turn out tend to be young people, those on lower incomes, who tend to vote Democrat. "If we see a two per cent improvement in Republican turnout and a two per cent drop in Democrat turnout it would be decisive. That's why everybody is thinking the same way, that it will come down to turn out."
Mr Smith thinks the most likely outcome is a narrow Romney victory, followed by a narrow Obama victory and a comfortable Romney win. "The key decision for voters is not who they are going to vote for, but whether or not they will vote at all," he says. That calculation, he thinks, will fall the challenger's way. US Election

Age: 24
Position: Striker Rooney is the one player England cannot do without on the high veld next summer. The distractions of being a new father should not count. His displays this season for Manchester United have been inspirational and his goals should prove the decisive factor if Fabio Capello's team are to reach the World Cup final at Johannesburg's Soccer City on July 11. Before Theo Walcott came on the scene, Rooney became the youngest player to play for England when he earned his first cap in a friendly against Australia on Feb 12, 2003, aged 17. Related Articles

Zinc Leaf Trail Watering Can, £20
We like the faded metal-look of this classic watering can, which has a delicate leaf pattern winding along its body. The can could also be used as an unusual planter or vase.

Porthcurno, near Land's End, Cornwall
Set beneath the clifftop Minack Theatre, this is arguably the county's most beautiful bay: a funnel of sand caught between lichen-encrusted granite cliffs. Easily accessible, it has fine white sand and is popular with families. It's best at low tide when you can walk to other beaches in the bay (one of which is nudist) and sit on sandbars beneath the ancient cliff fort of Treryn Dinas, surrounded by Grecian-blue water. Stay at Boskenna farmhouse b&b at St Buryan (01736 810705; www.luxury-cornwall.co.uk). Eat at The Coffee Shop at the Minack Theatre, above the beach (www.minack.com): you have to pay £4 admission to the site, but this includes access to the gardens. Comments on this gallery
