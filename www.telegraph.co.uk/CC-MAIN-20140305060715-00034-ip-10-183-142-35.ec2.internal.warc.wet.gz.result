Michael, review
Markus Schleinzer's debut film about the routine of a paedophile, Michael, makes for heart-stopping, mind-frazzling cinema. 4
Michael Fuith as Michael By Robbie Collin

Follow Comments
18 cert, 96 min
Dir: Markus Schleinzer. Starring Michael Fuith, David Rauchenberger When the door to Michael’s basement first swings open, the inky blackness beyond it is as unfathomable as it is impenetrable. Michael (Michael Fuith) is a paedophile. He is 35 years old, with a moderately successful career in insurance and a ten-year-old boy imprisoned in his cellar. In his directorial debut, the Austrian filmmaker Markus Schleinzer shows us Michael and his prisoner Wolfgang (David Rauchenberger) going about their daily routine: food is fried and eaten, plates are washed, television is watched until bedtime. What we don’t see – or rather what Schleinzer doesn’t show us – are almost any explicit details of abuse or rape. But our minds’ eyes fill in the blanks, and by the sheer power of association, the routine itself becomes terrifying. Schleinzer could hardly have chosen a more difficult subject, but he treats it with an unnerving simplicity, shorn of sensationalism or obvious moral cues. Comparisons with the work of Michael Haneke are inevitable but deserved, and the similarities are surely no accident: Schleinzer has often worked as Haneke’s casting director.

Individual scenes stick in the mind like stains: Michael talking to a second young boy at a go-karting centre, Michael happily singing a Boney M song in the car after being promoted, Michael bringing buckets of snow down to the cellar so he can throw snowballs at Wolfgang. The ending delivers the gut-wrenching catharsis we crave, but with an acid afterburn. This is heart-stopping, mind-frazzling cinema; hard to recommend but even harder not to. Film Reviews

Deep in the forest, I wait expectantly for my prey – the secretive wild boar
Left to themselves, the population of wild boar - now well established in Sussex, Dorset and Gloucestershire - would treble annually. Tusk, tusk: Simon Barr and Clive Aslet look in vain for a boar from their eyrie in a Sussex wood Photo: Andrew Hasson	By Clive Aslet
7:30AM GMT 27 Dec 2011
Comments
Ssssh! We are sitting in a wooden cabin on stilts, somewhere in Sussex. Nothing stirs. The last time the animal we are looking for was spotted in significant numbers was in in the Middle Ages, rootling through the deep-pile oak leaf carpet of the forest floor, just before it was hunted to extinction. But three populations of wild boar have now become established in Britain, following their escape from farms which breed them for their excellent meat. While the ferocious creatures of lore have a tendency to burst from the undergrowth, the sounders – or boar families – of Sussex and Dorset live mostly peaceful, retired lives, keeping out of sight of poachers. However, this month visitors to the Forest of Dean have been enjoying close encounters with the boar. They pet them, give them food, and presumably imagine that the creatures have the happy-go-lucky attitude of Pumbaa, the warthog in The Lion King. But as Simon Barr, owner of the hide, observes, “like any wild animal, they can be unpredictable”. Get between a sow and its young, and you won’t find it singing Hakuna Matata.
In this health-and-safety-conscious age, no landowner wants to risk a lawsuit, should a visitor find him or herself on the business end of a well-honed tusk. An adult boar, weighing 200kg, can be the size of a family sofa. When they charge, you know about it.
Sows produce eight or nine piglets per litter, and are capable of breeding twice a year. Left to themselves, numbers of wild boar would treble annually. This year has been a successful breeding season due to abundant acorns, beechmast and sweet chestnut. Consequently, the Forestry Commission, owners of the Forest of Dean, have decided that a family of boar popular with visitors known as the Beechenhurst Six will have to take its chances in a cull with 1,000 others.

For Simon, the problem is more about conserving a healthy population. His patch is an 800-acre block of woodland, to which he buys the shooting rights. On it, he sustainably manages 300 or so wild boar by carefully selecting targets. They are likely to be young males: “Wild boars live in matriarchal groups, headed by a lead sow. She shows the group where to live and feed. Take out the sow and there will be a mass dispersal, causing damage to the farmland outside the wood.”
Unlike grey squirrels, which ring-bark growing trees, wild boars are the forester’s friend. Blessed with bony snouts, they root through the ground looking for invertebrates and bluebell bulbs, rotavating the earth and facilitating natural regeneration. Many farmers, however, argue that the wild boar is a pest.
Wild boar may or may not be regarded as native to the countryside – they were reintroduced when several escaped from farms during the Great Storm of 1987. But, like other wildlife, they should be properly managed and humanely treated. As Zac Goldsmith MP suggested last month, this ought to mean a closed season; if a sow is shot during spring or summer, her piglets will be left to starve. In Eastern Europe, wild boar is a prime quarry species, and enthusiasts pay big money for the sport of shooting it. As with venison, they have a system by which the meat is tagged as soon as it is shot, so it can be traced through the supply chain, thereby reducing poaching.
For us right now, the problem is not so much avoiding an onslaught of wild boar as seeing one specimen. These beasts operate to a Proustian schedule. They get up when the rest of the world is going to bed. There is a reason that Simon has installed comfortable office chairs in his hide, despite their less than rustic appearance; he is often here all night.
From our eyrie above the Sussex wood, we see a glorious cock pheasant. On terra firma, Simon finds a wallow; a large, pig-shaped mud bath in a stream. We stomp around a grove of trees, observing one last fallen apple, which will probably be gone by morning.
But I do eventually find a boar. This happens in Simon’s partly 16th-century cottage, shared with Selena, whom he married last month (Guess what was served at the wedding feast…). To judge from its expression, it’s just as well the taxidermist got to it first.

The financial benefits of living with your partner
Even if you just live together, it's worth buying as a couple whenever you can.

Darren Whitlock, 31, and his wife, Emma, have saved money by pooling their finances. They have taken out a joint account with Santander, which gives them cashback on all of the bills they pay. They also share a mobile phone contract and car insurance policies. Mr Whitlock, from Potter’s Bar in Hertfordshire, said that previously Emma paid the bills and he paid the mortgage, but the cashback from the joint account was adding up to £200 or £300 a year. “We already have a mortgage together so our finances are joined as it is,” he said. Living together can have financial, as well as emotional, benefits, new figures have shown. However, joint finances can be a double-edged sword. Exclusive research from Aviva shows that over half of households are missing out on the savings they could gain from opening joint accounts, having joint insurance policies and using products such as family railcards. The research shows that the average household could save over £350 a year by amalgamating some financial products, but that many people are not taking advantage of this. Cohabiting couples, the fastest-growing family type in Britain, are the least likely to merge their finances. Related Articles

Some of the biggest savings for couples include joint home insurance policies. The typical saving that can be made by a couple on these products is £84 – 10pc of the average spend. Buying a family railcard can also save an average of £99 a year. “At a time when many families are feeling the squeeze, reviewing finances and consolidating spending to make the most of multi-person discounts could be a simple and effective way to save money,” said Heather Smith, director of marketing at Aviva. “In most cases changing your policies or applying for joint contracts is much easier than you think and savings can be substantial.”
However, multi-car insurance is not always cheapest, so ensure that you shop around with both single and multi car policies, rather than assuming the discount will be the best bet. Other places where couples can potentially save include mobile phone contracts and breakdown cover. Families who use a joint paid-for bank account can often get cover for everyone’s mobile phones, for example, as well as family travel insurance more cheaply than joint policies. However, it is important to check that the cover you are getting matches your needs, and that you are not excluded from claiming due to your age, or any medical conditions you might have. Before you share your finances, it is important to understand the risks that merging your money can bring. One of the most important assets you have is your credit record, which will be checked every time you apply for a mortgage, a loan, or even a mobile phone contract. The credit record shows all the financial products that you own as well as your track record on paying them off. Based on this record, financial companies will decide whether to give you a loan or mortgage, and also whether to give you a good rate or not. Once you merge your finances, however, creditors can see that you have a financial relationship with another person. In the eyes of the banks and building societies, your creditworthiness is then affected by the other person’s financial decision. So if your partner is late paying off his credit card, you can suffer too. Your credit report, which you can see for £2 if you apply by post to Experian, Equifax or Call Credit (three major credit rating agencies), or for free with noddle.co.uk in return for viewing some advertisements, will show any financial connections you are deemed to have with other people. There is an Association box in your credit report where you can view this, but you will not be able to view their credit information to see whether it is good or bad. If you split up with your partner, or fear that their credit record is spoiling yours, you can apply for a financial disassociation. You will need to do this with all three agencies. Experian’s is available at tinyurl.com/cqt3f99, while Callcredit’s form needs to be posted but is online at tinyurl.com/d5ydhqs. Equifax requires you to have a credit report number in order to access these details at equifax.co.uk. You should also be aware when taking out what looks like a “joint” credit card that there is no such thing. Often, a credit card company will offer you a second card for a partner when you take out the first. This can be useful if you are racking up Air Miles or cashback on your spending. However, you need to be aware that the person who applied for the cards is solely responsible for the debt on both of them. If you do split up, untangle your finances as quickly as possible. Close any joint accounts, and credit cards with second cardholders on them. If you are renting, notify the landlord and make sure the name of the person who is moving out is removed from the tenancy agreement. Finally, if you have a new partner and believe that they have had debt problems in the past, make sure you keep your finances completely separate. That means no joint names on bills, loans or credit cards. It takes up to six years for their financial issues to be removed from their credit record, so make sure that yours isn’t affected. • Want to know more?

The last survivor of the Lisbon Maru
Seventy years ago, a cargo ship sank with thousands of Allied PoWs trapped in the hold by the Japanese
'What can I remember? Well, if you had been to hell, you’d know what it was like. It was hell,' says Dennis Morley, 92 Photo: JAY WILLIAMS	By Malcolm Moore
7:00AM BST 30 Sep 2012

The first torpedo came at 7 in the morning, when the Lisbon Maru, with her cargo of nearly 2,000 British and Canadian prisoners, was off the Chinese coast near Shanghai.
The rusting Japanese freighter was taking the men, captured after the surrender of Hong Kong at the end of 1941, to slave in Japan’s dockyards and ports, its coal mines and factories. But it never reached its destination.
With no flags or markings to warn that it was carrying prisoners below decks, and with nearly 800 Japanese soldiers visible on board, it appeared a perfect target to an American submarine.
Tomorrow marks the 70th anniversary of what turned out to be one of the most callous incidents in a particularly callous arena of the Second World War. As the crippled vessel slowly began to sink, a Japanese decision to batten down the hatches on the prisoners below, then to shoot mercilessly at those who managed to escape and swim for it, led to the deaths of nearly 1,000 men.
“What can I remember? Well, if you had been to hell, you’d know what it was like. It was hell,” said Dennis Morley, 92, who was a private in the Royal Scots at the time.

Mr Morley may well be the last survivor of the tragedy. Tony Banham, a Hong Kong-based historian who has written an account of the sinking, said: “One by one, the others I was in touch with have all gone quiet. [But] there could still be others. I am in touch with other prisoners of war who are older [than Dennis].”
The anniversary will go unmarked in China, Japan and in the UK, and it comes as tensions in the sea that separates Asia’s two great powers are rising once again – not least because of the bitter memories of other wartime atrocities inflicted on China and its people by Japan’s army. The sailing of the Lisbon Maru was ill-fated from the start. After nearly a year in PoW camps in Hong Kong, three quarters of the men on board were sick when they boarded, with dysentery, diphtheria or beriberi.
The ship’s three vast and gloomy cargo holds were filled with two-tier wooden platforms covered in thin rush matting. Each man was allotted 18 inches of space.
The bulk of the prisoners were from three regiments, the Royal Scots, Middlesex Regiment and Royal Artillery.
“My lot was right on the bottom of the number two hold,” said Mr Morley. “And being on the bottom, we were inundated by faeces falling from the people above.”
The Lisbon Maru was a hulking freight ship that displaced some 7,000 tons. She was 22 years old by the time she set sail from Hong Kong, and had recently been used both to transport metal and then troops.
When she was spotted by the USS Grouper six miles off the Zhoushan archipelago, the American submarine commander could have had no inkling of her cargo.
Mr Banham’s recorded what happened after the Grouper opened fire in his book, The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru.
“On the morning of October 1st, about 7am, most people were awake and awaiting the first meal of the day. Suddenly a loud noise, like air escaping from a tyre, was heard and one could not tell whether it was inboard or outboard. We later realised it was a torpedo that had missed,” said Alf Hunt, who was also a prisoner.
It was the fourth torpedo, a one-and-a-half ton, 20ft missile, that hit the stern. Immediately, the Japanese ordered all prisoners down into the holds as the ship slowly began to sink.
“We firmly believed the Japs would not let us drown. They could not be so heartless that they would let 1,800 helpless men die,” said James Miller of the Royal Scots.
But in fact the Japanese command battened down the hatches on the three holds and then stretched tarpaulin and set up a machine-gun post to shoot any escapees.
As the ship went down, 10 Japanese vessels in the area came to its aid, ferrying off the 778 Japanese soldiers. But the British prisoners were left behind, frantically trying to pump water out of their holds.
“After a while there was a moment when the panic sunk in,” remembered Mr Morley. “But that did not last long. Eventually some bright fellow who had a knife managed to cut the canvas and get the hatch open. The first lot that got out were shot by the Japs on the bridge, but eventually they managed to get over and kill them.
“Then there was a panic on the ladder, but one officer, I think his name was Cuthbertson, took control and got everyone to go up the ladder one by one and eventually we all got up. Once we were clear, Cuthbertson went back down to check there was no one left behind.”
In all, 1,750 prisoners made it off the ship and into the water. Many of them started swimming for the Japanese rescue flotilla, but were greeted with more rifle fire.
Not only did Japanese soldiers strafe the water, but some men who climbed up on to Japanese boats were shot in the head and dumped back into the sea.
Mr Morley, however, was eventually picked up by a Japanese craft, given some “green tea and a cigarette”, and taken to Shanghai.
For around 300 of his fellow prisoners, rescue came in the form of Chinese fishermen, who risked Japanese fire to sail out from the nearby islands and pick them up.
“My father was 13 at the time and he helped to rescue the people coming onshore,” said Liang Yingji, 45. “Most of the people who were involved have passed away now, although my father is still alive. The fishermen saved 338 of the prisoners in total. They risked their lives to do it.”
Afterwards, however, the fishermen did not report the rescue to the government, shying away from any praise. One of the British prisoners gave his mouth organ to a fisherman in gratitude, but the islanders were so poor that it was traded for a bag of rice.
A museum on Dongji island, where the fishermen took the prisoners and cared for them in the local temple, was opened in 2009, with a replica of the ship and clippings from the reports in the British press. Beer barrels that floated up from the wreck, which lies in around 100ft of water, are on display, as are the mess tins and cutlery that some of the prisoners had with them.
No one has yet made a proper dive to examine the wreck, however. Steve Chan, who runs a dive shop in Wanchai, Hong Kong, said he had “touched” the boat, but been unable to see it properly because of poor visibility.
The survivors spent only a day on the island before a Japanese ship landed and recaptured them. They were taken to Shanghai, where a roll call showed that 846 men had perished.
Three soldiers managed to hide in a cave on the island, and then made their way to Chongqing, then the capital of non-occupied China.
From there they were eventually shipped to Japan, where another 246 died before the winter was out. Mr Morley spent the remainder of the war in forced labour, first in the maritime city of Kobe and then at a small port called Fusiki – a tough existence, but one in which it was necessary for him and fellow prisoners at least to be fed, in order that they could work productively.
For that, he is thankful: when the war ended and Americans finally arrived, he and fellow forced labourers glimpsed how their lives in Japan might have been even worse as they were driven to the ships waiting to carry them homeward.
“We saw the PoW camps where they were all skeletons,” he said.
He recalls with pleasure their gradual progress towards Britain. “They shipped us first to the Philippines and then to Canada,” he said. “We went on board the USS Admiral Hughes to Vancouver. We crossed Canada and at every place we stopped we got a hero’s welcome, including a Native Indian war dance in the Rockies.”
In September 1946, the Japanese interpreter on board the Lisbon Maru, Niimori Genichiro, was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The captain, Kyoda Shigeru, who had at first resisted orders to batten down the hatches, was tried before a different tribunal that year and given seven years in prison.
Lieutenant Wada Hideo, who outranked Kyoda as a military officer, and who overruled him and ordered the hatches shut, died before he could face justice.
When Dennis Morley returned to the UK, he was transferred by the Army to work in its medical corps. He then moved to a civilian hospital as an orderly.
He had two wives, his first died very young, at 30, but bore him a daughter. When he married his second wife, he inherited two boys and a girl. Mr Morley now lives in Stroud, Gloucestershire. He has made a few trips back to Hong Kong – and went on a “peace and reconciliation” trip to Japan in 2007.
“I’m glad I did that because I have wiped everything off now and I am at peace,” he said. “I do not have any bad dreams. I am a happy man.”

Bodysgallen Hall, Llandudno, Conwy Climb the hotel’s tower and you’ll be rewarded with a panorama that includes Snowdonia, Anglesey and the Great Orme. This fine mansion, which dates from the 17th century, may not be right by the sea, but Llandudno’s beaches are minutes away and the National Trust-owned property has great character, with antique-filled bedrooms and 16 postcard-pretty cottages scattered around the estate’s 200 acres of wooded parkland. There’s also a spa, including huge indoor pool, a formal dining room and relaxed dining at Bistro 1620. Read the full review here
