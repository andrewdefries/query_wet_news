Government is fixing the roof by taking tiles from other houses
'it hardly seems like we are fixing the roof while the sun shines. The Government is cutting its borrowing by getting households to borrow more'

A good day for George Osborne. In his Autumn Statement the Chancellor lowered the government borrowing forecasts for the first time in three years on the back of faster growth. The problem is that the better outlook is being bought with unbalanced growth. The government may be fixing its roof, but could also be building a less, rather than a more resilient, economy. Forget all the announced policies today, which were generally small and net off against each other. Osborne banked the gains from stronger growth, cutting the deficit by a cumulative £73bn over the next five years. That was the right strategy. Borrowing is better but it is hardly good. The deficit is expected to be £96bn next year. Today’s changes just undo the damage of the last 12 months of disappointing numbers. Osborne deserves credit for trying to deal with the longer-term issues. With continued austerity and a fair wind – and another Conservative government, Osborne would add – the deficit should be eliminated by 2019. Planning to raise the retirement age was also necessary, if not welcome for the under-40s affected. Cutting National Insurance contributions for under 21 year-olds was also sensible. Related Articles

The issue is that the growth is coming from consumers spending money they don’t have. Stronger consumption explains much of the better growth outlook. In turn, that is because households are saving less and re-leveraging. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects household debt to rise to 160pc of income by 2018 and house prices to get close to their bubble time peak by 2018, in real times. This all stacks up, given the reliance on monetary policy to get the economy moving. But it hardly seems like we are fixing the roof while the sun shines. More like fixing the government’s roof by taking tiles from others' houses. The Government is cutting its borrowing by getting households to borrow more. A resurgent housing market is boosting stamp duty. VAT is rising as retail spending grows. Without households dipped into their saving over the past 12 months, there would be a lot less money flowing into the government’s coffers. For the government to borrow less, someone else has to take some of the responsibility for getting the economy growing. But it feels like this is an option we tried before the crisis with, to put it mildly, less than stellar results. It isn’t all bad. It would be churlish not to welcome lower government borrowing, a recovering economy and falling unemployment. Growth is better than stagnation even if it comes from households initially. Indeed, returning confidence may kick-start some more spending by businesses and a return to rising productivity. The government has not been totally idle either. It has cut corporation tax substantially, for instance. Today is a day to be pleased today with the improving deficit outlook and measures to deal with the poor longer-term debt trajectory. But tomorrow will be time to look for measures to move away from this unbalanced growth over the next year. In fairness, the Bank of England started trying to dial things down a notch by cancelling part of the Funding for Lending Scheme that was spraying cheap funding at any bank that would take it. That is likely to be the first in a series of measures from the financial policymakers. The Help-to-Buy scheme should be scrapped, the government should be doing much more to boost housebuilding. The £1bn offered in today’s statement is not enough. More broadly UK infrastructure spending is woefully short of what is required. The to-do list is long. Lets not wait too long before getting cracking. Rob Wood is UK economist at Berenberg Bank and former economist at the Bank of England

Tricks that save up to £500 on a holiday
It is a game of brinkmanship as tour operators and agents aim to sell all their holidays at the best price. Our tips give you the upper hand Dream holiday: cut hundreds of pounds off the cost of your trip by researching the market thoroughly and then haggling for a better deal By Nicole Blackmore

January is the busiest time of the year for holiday bookings thanks to the gloomy weather and post-Christmas slump. Tour operators and travel agents feverishly compete for your business with promises of discounts and special deals. But it is a game of brinkmanship. Companies want to extract the maximum from customers but also don’t want to be left with unsold holidays. Which package deals are best?
Package holidays remain the most popular type of booking, according to Abta, the travel trade association, with 46pc of holidaymakers – 16.5million people – buying that way. They are bought either directly, from tour operators such as Thomson and Thomas Cook, or through a travel agent. The holiday – with flights, transfers, accommodation and sometimes food included – are Atol protected. This means that if your travel company fails, you will be entitled to a refund if you are yet to travel, and hotel costs and flights home if you are already abroad. Related Articles

Thorough research is essential when booking. Prices for the same holiday can vary, even when offered by brands owned by the same company. Sometimes this is because services and extras, perhaps unwanted, are added on. Our research found that the cheapest deal on a week’s all-inclusive holiday for a family of four in Ibiza in late July with First Choice was £3,855. But the same break – same hotel and same flights – cost £3,388 via Thomson, a saving of £467. Both are owned by Tui Travel. First Choice markets the resort as one of its upmarket “Holiday Villages”. The more expensive holiday offers a sea view. Once you have an online price, use it to your advantage. Haggling is still alive and well in the holiday industry so contact rival providers or travel agents to see if they can beat it. Agents also offer holidays they have put together, made up of flights, accommodation and extras such as car hire, provided by different companies. These are not traditional package holidays, but agents often refer to them as such. New rules introduced last year mean these holidays are Atol protected if the flight and either the hotel or car hire are booked within one day of each another. But flights only, booked through a travel agent or direct with airlines, are not protected under Atol. Is it cheaper to book your own?
Travel agents and tour operators claim their buying power brings down the cost. For the particular holiday you want, only research will tell you which is cheaper. DIY holidays are a good option if you want to travel for an extended or unusual period but holidaymakers are left with little protection if the airline or hotel goes bust. How should you pay?
Paying with a credit card can offer additional protection in the event that your travel company goes bust. You should be able to get your money back for payments of up to £30,000. However, credit card issuers will not help you get home if you are abroad when the company goes out of business. But buying with a credit card often comes at a cost, with firms commonly charging a fee of 2pc, sometimes 3pc. First Choice and Thomson cap the charge at £95. Some companies, such as travel agent Trailfinders and tour operator Toucan, charge nothing. If you have a Visa debit card, which does not usually incur a booking fee, ask your bank whether you are covered under “chargeback”, a voluntary policy. Also check whether your travel insurance covers you for losses if your holiday provider goes bust. The insurance traps to avoid
Carefully check terms and conditions. Many travel insurance policies do not cover losses if a holiday company goes bust, which leaves DIY holidaymakers exposed. Cancellation cover can also vary significantly between insurers. Some policies will cover only losses caused by cancellation due to personal illness. Richard Young, 66, of Gosport, Hampshire, booked a trip to Italy and took out insurance with Staysure. He was travelling with his choir, the Portsmouth Choral Union, which was giving a number of performances. Mr Young was due to fly on May 24 from Heathrow to Bologna with British Airways. However, BA cancelled a number of scheduled flights following an incident at the airport. Mr Young, who is a retired serviceman, was unable to book a later flight and was forced to abandon his trip. BA refunded the cost of the flight, £211, but denied any liability for additional losses. Mr Young contacted Staysure and lodged a claim for his accommodation and pre-booked excursion costs, which totalled £584. Staysure rejected the claim, saying the policy did not cover losses due to flight cancellation. “Staysure said it would have covered the cancellation if I was poorly and couldn’t travel, but not a cancellation that was out of my control,” Mr Young said. “Is it appropriate that a policy should make such an exclusion? I did not miss the trip because of my own stupidity or sloth. Should I be left to bear the financial burden of BA’s decision? ”
Staysure said it was important for customers to check when they took out a travel insurance policy what expenses would and wouldn’t be covered. However, a spokesman said there might have been an error in Mr Young’s case and promised to review his claim. Richard Young and his wife Celia When is the best time to book?
If you must travel during school holidays, grab summer holiday deals in January or before. If you don’t book early, consider leaving it to the last minute instead. Tour operators and travel agents often slash their prices a month or so before departure. You will have less choice, but the chances of grabbing a bargain are high. One trick for the most dedicated bargain hunters is to watch out for trading updates from the big tour operators. Thomas Cook, for example, will disclose its sales performance on February 11. Disappointment could mean a sale of last-minute holidays. Save money on flights by booking in advance and flying midweek. Analysis of pricing data suggests it is cheapest to fly on a Tuesday, as long as you book 59 days in advance, according to Moneysavingexpert.com. There are a number of websites that help you identify the cheapest flights – comparison website momondo.co.uk has a tool called Flight Insight that lets you interrogate specific data for 150 popular routes, while Kayak.co.uk has a tool that predicts whether the cost of the flight you want is likely to go up or down over the next seven days. Cheaper spending when you're there...
CARDS Banks and building societies charge up to 3pc for foreign transactions. So apply now for a specialist overseas credit card that offers a good exchange rate with no withdrawal fees. The best card is Halifax Clarity. It has no foreign exchange fee anywhere in the world, so you get the best rate possible. It also doesn’t charge a fee for withdrawing cash from ATMs, but you will be charged interest on withdrawals. If you don’t want to take out a credit card or don’t have a good enough credit rating to qualify for the best deals, consider a prepaid card. They are a good way to control your budget and can be replaced and re-credited if lost or stolen. You pay the exchange rate offered on the day you load the card, not at the time of purchase, so there are no surprises. FairFX and CaxtonFX are good options. CASH
Few travel money firms make a direct charge but the exchange rates, through which they take their cut, vary considerably. Retailers are muscling in. Debenhams, Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda are all offering impressive rates this week. However, to get the best deals buyers should always order online and then collect. Even airport bureaus can be competitive if you order ahead. The rates at the window, however, are priced for desperate travellers with no other option. Compare rates at travelmoneymax.com.
