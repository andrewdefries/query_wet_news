Prince William's flying tutor killed in high-speed motorcycle crash
Prince William's flying tutor was killed in a high-speed motorcycle crash as he tried to overtake a truck which failed to indicate it was turning right, an inquest heard today.

3:14PM GMT 22 Jan 2013
Follow James Hassell, 36, was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident on the A417 near Faringdon, Oxfordshire, on March 10 last year.
The inquest, at Oxford Coroner's Court, heard the "very distinguished helicopter pilot and instructor" was also a keen motorcyclist who enjoyed going for long motorbike rides around the countryside at weekends with his friend and colleague Matthew Coverley.
Mr Coverley told the hearing he and Mr Hassell, known as Jim, had just left the village of Faringdon and were travelling down the narrow country lane when he noticed a green truck travelling about 300 metres in front of them at around 9.35am on the Saturday.
He said Mr Hassell was around 6-10m in front of him, with his own motorbike staggered to the left of his bike.
As they approached the vehicle he said they both accelerated to between 70-80mph in order to overtake it but the truck then began to turn right into a farm entrance without indicating, slowing down or appearing to notice them.

Mr Coverley said: "I didn't see any indication on the truck, neither prior to or as it turned.
"Jim steered towards the left of the carriageway to attempt to avoid the truck.
"The truck was travelling in a continual motion, as if it has not seen Jim.
"In my mind it was all in slow motion.
"I saw Jim's body hit the truck. I continued to break hard, stopping at the side of the road."
Mr Coverley said he was sure that the driver of the truck had not used his indicator.
"Both Jim and I are experienced riders and we always look for indications and we would not even attempt to overtake if we thought the truck was turning," he said.
But giving his own evidence, the truck's driver, Polish national Marek Kucala, told the inquest that he had seen one of the motorcycles and had indicated that he was turning.
He said: "I indicated much earlier, before the entrance to Manor Farm as I knew where I was about to turn.
"The first time I checked my mirrors I didn't see anyone.
"When I moved to the centre of the road I checked the mirrors for the second time and I noticed the motorcycle."
Speaking through an interpreter, he said that as he saw the motorcycle was trying to overtake him he then tried to swerve back to the left side of the road to let him pass.
"It's really difficult to describe as all of it happened in a fraction of a second," he added.
Mr Hassell, who was based at RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset and lived in Middle Wallop, Hampshire, gave the Duke of Cambridge helicopter flight training five years ago. Prince William

Norway convicts two men over al-Qaeda plot on Danish newspaper Two men were found guilty on Monday of involvement in an al-Qaeda plot to attack a Danish newspaper that caricatured the Prophet Muhammad, the first convictions under Norway's anti-terror laws. Shawan Sadek Saeed Bujak during his sentencing Photo: AFP PHOTO / Stian Lysberg Solum 3:03PM GMT 30 Jan 2012
A third defendant was acquitted of terror charges but convicted of helping the others acquire explosives.Investigators say the plot was linked to the same al-Qaeda planners behind thwarted attacks against the New York subway system and a shopping mall Manchester in 2009.The Oslo district court sentenced alleged ringleader Mikael Davud, to seven years in prison and co-defendant Shawan Sadek Saeed Bujak to three and a half years.Judge Oddmund Svarteberg said the court found that Davud, a Chinese Muslim, "planned the attack together with al-Qaeda". Bujak was deeply involved in the preparations, but it couldn't be proved that he was aware of Davud's contacts with al-Qaeda, the judge said.The third defendant, David Jakobsen, who assisted police in the investigation, was convicted on an explosives charge and sentenced to four months in prison – time he's already served in pretrial detention.

It wasn't immediately clear if any of the defendants would appeal.The case was Norway's most high-profile terror investigation until last July, when a right-wing extremist killed 77 people in a bomb and shooting massacre.The three men, who were arrested in July 2010, made some admissions but pleaded innocent to terror conspiracy charges and rejected any links to al-Qaeda.During the trial Davud denied he was taking orders from al-Qaeda, saying he was planning a solo raid against the Chinese Embassy in Oslo. He said he wanted revenge for Beijing's oppression of Uighurs, a Muslim minority in western China.Davud, who moved to Norway in 1999 and later became a Norwegian citizen, also said his co-defendants helped him acquire bomb-making ingredients but didn't know he was planning an attack.Prosecutors said the Norwegian cell first wanted to attack Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, whose 12 cartoons of Muhammad sparked furious protests in Muslim countries in 2006, and then changed plans to seek to murder one of the cartoonists instead.Bujak, an Iraqi Kurd, said the paper and the cartoonist were indeed the targets, but described the plans as "just talk".Prosecutors had to prove the defendants worked together in a conspiracy, because a single individual plotting an attack is not covered under Norway's anti-terror laws."There is no doubt that Davud took the initiative to prepare the terror act and that he was the ring leader," the judge said as he delivered the verdict.He said Davud planned to carry out the attack himself by placing a bomb outside Jyllands-Posten's offices in Aarhus, in western Denmark.The men had been under surveillance for more than a year when authorities moved to arrest them. Norwegian investigators, who worked with their US counterparts, said the defendants were building a bomb in a basement laboratory in Oslo.Jakobsen, an Uzbek national who changed his name after moving to Norway, provided some of the chemicals for the bomb, but claims he did not know they were meant for explosives. Jakobsen contacted police and served as an informant, but still faced charges for his involvement before that.An Associated Press investigation in 2010 showed that authorities learned early on about the alleged cell by intercepting emails from an al-Qaeda operative in Pakistan and – thanks to those early warnings – were able to secretly replace a key bomb-making ingredient with a harmless liquid when Jakobsen ordered it at an Oslo pharmacy.The judge said it had been proven that Davud had contacts with al-Qaida in Pakistan, and that his notebook contained references to Saleh al-Somali, al-Qaeda's chief of external operations, who officials believe helped organise the New York, Manchester and Norway plots. He was killed in a CIA drone strike in Pakistan in 2009.During the trial, prosecutors presented testimony obtained in the US in April from three American al-Qaida recruits turned government witnesses.Source: AP Al-Qaeda

Australia falls back in love with beautiful game
Seven years into the often troubled life of Australia’s A-League, football is finally putting down roots in the world’s most overcrowded sporting market. Australia falls back in love with beautiful game Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Simon Briggs, in Melbourne

How do we know? Because the locals aren’t calling it “soccer” any more. A jaundiced British observer might be tempted to scoff at average attendances of 13,000. Or the fact that this season’s three marquee overseas signings are – in descending order of renown – Alessandro del Piero, Emile Heskey and Shinji Ono. But we could also learn something from football in Australia. Especially from the way it combines the passionate, inventive chanting of European or South American crowds with a family-friendly wholesomeness. In what feels like a throwback to the flat-cap era in Britain, small children and pensioners can attend matches without being subjected to ear-splitting profanities. Twas not ever thus. The precursor to the A-League was something called the National Soccer League, which was full of ethnically polarised clubs. When Sydney Croatia played Sydney Olympic (the latter named for its strong Greek influence), there was always some sort of trouble. Scuffles, lit flares and racial abuse grew increasingly commonplace, until, in 2004, the whole enterprise collapsed under its own tensions. Adelaide United, the team from Australia’s gentlest and sleepiest city, is the only survivor from those civil wars. Related Articles

After the fall, the resurrection. In 2005, Australia’s then prime minister John Howard persuaded Frank Lowy, billionaire founder of the Westfield shopping centre chain, to help launch a new competition. “One of the original slogans was ‘Old soccer, new football,’” says Tom Smithies, a British journalist who now works as football editor at the (unrelated) Sydney Daily Telegraph. “It was a brave move, because football in Australia always meant Aussie rules in Melbourne. The word could even be used to refer to rugby league in Sydney. And here was this outsider sport saying it wanted to be taken seriously, even though it had no great tradition or pedigree. But it’s only recently that ‘football’ has started to catch on.”
The A-League has been through a few dark times since 2005, if not as dark as before. Crowd figures enjoyed an early surge, then slumped, and are gradually inching back up to the levels they reached in 2007-08. The failed bid for the 2022 World Cup, which fared even worse than England’s tilt at 2018, drained the energy, morale and cash reserves of the national federation. But the sport has felt increasingly buoyant since the 2011 Grand Final. Watched by a capacity crowd of 56,000, the match ended with a flourish that even Sergio Aguero might admire when Erik Paartalu headed an equaliser for the Brisbane Roar with the last touch of extra-time. The Roar, who play an attractive pass-and-move game despite the steamy temperatures of their native Queensland, went on to win on penalties. It might sound unlikely to British fans, but Heskey – the scorer of seven goals in 15 games for the Newcastle Jets this season – has supplied an extra sheen of his own. He has also been the subject of “Heskey Cam”, an unexpected innovation from Sky’s antipodean cousin Fox Sports, which excitedly proclaims that it will follow “every goal, every shot, every run”. Footballing purists see such enthusiasm as Australian sport’s answer to the cultural cringe. For those who live within Europe’s teeming football culture, it is hard to understand the fervent support for washed-up overseas stars such as Del Piero, whose salary of £1.25 million would hardly pay David Beckham’s grocery bill. And it is true that the quality of the matches equates roughly to the second half of the Championship. They are played in summer, to avoid clashing with other footballing codes, so the temperature is always high and the ground painfully hard on the hamstrings. But the A-League’s success proves again that football – as we Brits understand the word – is as contagious as the norovirus. Transplanted into a hostile environment, it cannot help but thrive. At least, as long as it manages to avoid those troublesome secondary infections of violence and racism. For all its image as a tough frontier nation, Australia is an increasingly rule-bound society, and it sees the A-League as a respectable family sport. In recent years, it is rugby league and Aussie Rules that have been more likely to feature punch-ups, and whose athletes have got up to no good off the field. Soccer is dead in Australia; long live football. Football
