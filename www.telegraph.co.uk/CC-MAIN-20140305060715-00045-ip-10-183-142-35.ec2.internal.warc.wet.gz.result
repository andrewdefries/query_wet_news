Hay Festival 2013: Duchess of Cornwall plays chess at Telegraph tent
On the opening day of the Hay Festival the Duchess of Cornwall plays chess with Hay primary pupils at the Telegraph tent
Video by Alastair Good
6:25PM BST 23 May 2013
Comments
The Telegraph's chess-themed tent at the Hay Festival had a special visit this afternoon from the Duchess of Cornwall. It's Schools Day at Hay and Her Royal Highness took part in a boys versus girls match with the giant chess pieces on the front porch of the Telegraph tent.
The Duchess, who is a strong supporter of children’s literacy projects, joined a team of four girls (in year 5) from Hay Primary School, and was very anxious to ensure the children did not get wet in the rain. She joined in the fun, after being invited to move the first white pawn. The match was eventually declared a draw by the match referee, Telegraph chess correspondent Malcolm Pein.

SABMiller beer sales disappoint in Europe but not in Britain
Brewer reports “unfavourable” performance in Europe although UK was a notable exception British drinkers’ thirst for imported beers such as Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Pilsner Urquell saw lager sales rise in the country By Nathalie Thomas

Beer volumes at SABMiller, the world’s second largest brewer, disappointed in the third quarter, although British drinkers’ thirst for imported beers such as Peroni Nastro Azzurro saw lager sales rise by 9pc in the UK. SAB, whose brands include Grolsch and Miller Genuine Draft, said lager volumes across the group increased by 1pc in the three months to December, disappointing analysts who had been anticipating closer to 2pc growth. The brewer reported an “unfavourable” performance in Europe, where lager volumes slumped 5pc during the period, although the UK was a notable exception. A growing interest in craft and imported beers in Britain helped SAB to report strong volume growth of 9pc in the UK, which the company said, was led by the success of Peroni Nastro Azzurro. Although SAB is listed in the UK, the brewer is heavily skewed towards the emerging markets. In Latin America, its lager volumes were up 2pc in the third quarter, while volumes in Africa increased by 6pc. Related Articles

SAB also saw particularly stellar volume growth in China, where other drinks companies have been reporting problems as a result of a government crackdown on entertainment and spending by bureaucrats. Volumes increased 13pc in the Dragon economy. Alan Clark, chief executive of SABMiller, said: "Growth in the third quarter was driven by our emerging market businesses where we are successfully targeting new consumers through affordability and premiumisation initiatives across our brand portfolios. “The combination of pricing and volume growth, particularly in Africa, Latin America and China, supported net producer revenue growth of four percent. This was in spite of continued weakness in consumer sentiment, which particularly impacted our European and North American businesses.”
SABMiller shares fell 1pc in early trading on Tuesday.

Buy-to-let borrowers face 2pc rate hike on 'trackers'
West Bromwich Building Society is increasing rates for 6,700 buy-to-let tracker borrowers in December. West Brom BTL customers face huge repayment hikes. Photo: Alamy	By Nicole Blackmore

Thousands of buy-to-let borrowers are facing huge increases to their mortgage repayments after West Bromwich Building Society announced it is hiking its rates for buy-to-let tracker mortgage customers by 2pc. The building society has confirmed that 6,700 borrowers will see their rate rise 2pc in December, which will significantly increase monthly repayments for these property investors. The change will affect landlords with multiple properties who took out a mortgage through West Brom's now defunct specialist lending arm West Bromwich Mortgage Company. These borrowers have deals that track the Bank of England's base rate, currently 0.5pc, plus a margin. This margin varies for the different borrowers, but all will see their overall rate rise by 2pc. West Brom is not the only lender to hike rates for customers with a tracker mortgage. In May, the Bank of Ireland increased rates for 13,500 tracker customers from base rate plus 1.75 per cent to base rate plus 4.49 per cent for buy-to-let deals and base rate plus 2.49 per cent for residential customers.

Growing anger at landlord lenders
11 Aug 2013
In October, BoI residential borrowers will suffer a further increase to base plus 3.99 per cent. Many BoI borrowers are furious about the decision and more than 300 are planning a class action against the bank, which blames the rise on higher capital requirements. Borrowers say the increase is based on an unfair contract term which does not comply with the city watchdog's requirements for lenders to treat customers fairly. In a small concession, BoI reversed the hike for 1,000 flexible account customers and 200 more who had switched to a tracker mortgage. The financial ombudsman said it has received more than 300 complaints from BoI customers about the rate changes so far and it is carrying out an inquiry. Virgin Money has also altered its buy-to-let offering, increasing the rate borrowers revert to after their fixed or tracker period ends. Previously buy-to-let borrowers reverted to the lender’s standard variable rate of 4.79pc, but from today new borrowers will revert to a new buy-to-let variable rate which is currently 4.99pc. These moves have further stoked fears that tracker rates could rise across the board, even if the Bank of England's base rate remains at 0.5pc. George Spencer, chief executive officer of property and technology company Rentify, said: “Landlords with West Bromwich Building Society will be reeling from the news that their mortgage rate is set to jump by two percentage points, even though there has been no movement in interest rates for more than four years. This will significantly impact landlords' profit margins. “Landlords with the West Brom would be wise to seek independent mortgage advice now and find out whether they can get a cheaper deal elsewhere, rather than wait until the rate hike in December."
There has been a significant increase in the availability of cheap buy-to-let mortgages recently, especially for borrowers with a decent deposit. This has helped boost the popularity of buy-to-let lending which was up 23pc between April and June, according to figures from the Bank of England. The Bank said this rate of growth is the highest since 2007. Lending to landlords, which in the three months to the end of June totalled £5bn, was up 29pc from £3.9bn a year earlier. Buy-to-let remains a controversial investment vehicle however and many are warning a bubble is forming in the housing market. Earlier this month Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, downplayed these fears. He told MPs he has seen no hard evidence that a bubble is materialising. But West Bromwich’s move to hike its rates may be an effort to limit its exposure to the buy-to-let market. It said its decision in a “reflection of market conditions”. A West Brom spokesman said: “The West Brom has advised a number of buy-to-let borrowers who have tracker mortgage accounts with West Bromwich Mortgage Company that their rates of interest will be increasing by 2pc from 1 December. All borrowers affected are landlords of multiple property portfolios. “These changes, which are permitted under the terms and conditions of the accounts, are a reflection of market conditions and the need for us to carry out our business prudently, efficiently and competitively.”

Vladimir Putin creates 'forbidden zone' around Sochi Olympic resort
Vladimir Putin has signed a decree imposing a "forbidden zone" and banning public gatherings around the city of Sochi ahead of the Winter Olympics in January and February. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree establishing strict controls on who can enter and move around the Sochi Winter Olympics site next year Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Roland Oliphant, Moscow
2:18PM BST 23 Aug 2013
Comments
The decree establishes strict controls on who can enter and move around the Black Sea resort, with vehicle searches and specially equipped checkpoints, as part of a ring of steel the Russian authorities hope will prevent the attacks threatened by insurgents waging an independence struggle in the nearby North Caucasus republics. The decree, published in the government's official newspaper Rossisskaya Gazeta on Friday, follows calls from the country's most wanted Islamist terrorist for his followers to hit the Games. Doku Umarov, the self-proclaimed Emir of the Caucasus Emirate, released a video in July in which he cancelled a ceasefire against Russian civilians and called for "maximum force" to be used to halt the Sochi Olympics. Umarov, a veteran of both Chechen wars who has managed to elude Russian attempts to capture or kill him for over a decade, is believed to have been behind suicide bombings on the Moscow Metro in 2010 and Domodedovo airport in 2011. While Sochi itself is a relatively quiet resort town, critics have questioned the decision to hold the Olympics in an area so close to the turbulent North Caucasus republics, where suicide bombings and shootouts between rebels and Russian security forces continue on a near daily basis.

The "forbidden zone" - closed to anyone for whom it is not "absolutely necessary" - creates an arc around the coastal resort from Russia's border with the breakaway republic of Abkhazia in the South and extending up into the densely wooded mountains behind Sochi where the downhill sports, including skiing and bob-sleigh, will take place. Any demonstrations, pickets or public meetings "not connected with the Olympic games" will be banned in the city between January 7 and March 21. No vehicles without local registration except emergency services and those with special dispensation will be allowed to enter the city limits or move around within it, and sales of weapons and other restricted items will be banned for the same period.

Sale Sharks 6 Montpellier 27: match report
Read a full match report of the Heineken Cup game between Sale and Montpellier at Salford City Stadium on Friday Jan 11, 2013 Too little too late: Sale's Danny Cipriani fails to stop Montpellier's Johnnie Beattie from scoring Photo: GETTY	By Paul Bolton

Comments
Sale regard the Heineken Cup as an unwanted distraction from their battle against relegation from the Premiership, so they will not be concerned by this predictable fourth straight European defeat.
Sale’s decision to include only six front-line players and to blood some of their youngsters in an under-­powered starting XV was an indication of where this competition ranks on their list of priorities.
“With the two French sides we have played against dominating we have to look at what is important for us and the Aviva is our lifeblood, our bread and butter, and we have got to concentrate on that,” Steve Diamond, Sale’s director of rugby, said.
The youngsters were lively in attack and demonstrated some of the spirit that Sale will require if they are to escape the drop by denying ­Montpellier the bonus-point try until the 78th minute.
Among the rookies was No 8 Josh Beaumont, whose father Bill, the former England captain and now Rugby Football Union chairman, was in a 6,000 crowd to watch his debut.

Beaumont, who also plays for his father’s old club Fylde, had a torrid time at the back of a scrum that went backwards for most of the evening but was praised by Diamond for his commitment.
“The young centre Mark Jennings did really well and Josh Beaumont did well at No 8 for his first game at this level,” Diamond said.
Johnnie Beattie, the former Scotland No 8, enjoyed himself at the back of Montpellier’s dominant scrum as he drove over for a first-half try. He was also twice held up over the line before the bonus point was secured with a late penalty try when Sale kicked the ball out of a scrum.
Montpellier were also dangerous in attack and crafted two lovely tries with wing Yohann Artru crossing for their opening try after a flowing move and full-back Pierre Berard rounding off a superb break from centre S­antiago Fernández early in the ­second half.
Danny Cipriani kept Sale in touch for a time with two penalties and some astute tactical kicking. “If he sticks to the kicking game for us he will be great,” Diamond said.
µ Ulster, the 2012 runners-up, reached the quarter-finals for a third straight season with a 23-6 win over Glasgow at Ravenhill. Nick Williams, Jared Payne and Darren Cave scored Ulster’s tries.

Britain's best seaside destinations
Brighton
Brighton manages to be both hip and quaint in a very British seaside kind of way; it’s also a shopping mecca. Drakes, a boutique hotel with roll-top baths and sea views, is the smartest place to stay (drakesof brighton.com). Hotel du Vin is where to go if you want to quaff, and breakfast, like a king and queen (hotelduvin.com). Tribeca is a lovely boutique for those who like understated elegance (tribeca-brighton.co.uk), as is I Gigi, which has homewares, too, plus a café (igigigeneralstore.com). Nola stocks edgy labels (nolaboutique.co.uk), while Lavender Room has quirky fashion and pretty gifts (lavender-room.co.uk). Splurge on vintage finds at Wolf & Gypsy Vintage (wolfandgypsyvintage.co.uk), next door at Hope & Harlequin (31 Sydney Street) and, for jewellery and bags, Penelope’s Portmanteau (penelopesportmanteau.com; also in Eastbourne). Powder Beauty is a dinky nail spa that does top-notch treatments (powderbeauty.co.uk). The high-class vegetarian restaurant Terre à Terre will also please carnivores (terreaterre.co.uk), or pop into Riddle & Finns for oysters and champagne (riddleandfinns.co.uk). Down the road in Hastings Judges Bakery sells award-winning cakes and breads – try the macaroons (judgesbakery.com). Duke of York’s Picturehouse is Britain’s oldest cinema and home to the Brighton Film Festival (picturehouses.co.uk).
