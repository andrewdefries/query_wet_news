The saddle saga: bats in Borneo
Our columnists learn how to shoot a blowpipe in Indonesian Borneo as they travel from London to Sydney by bicycle.

“Hello Mister,” shouted a young man from his zooming moped - just one of the hoards of vehicles rampaging through the streets of Pontianak, Indonesian Borneo. We’d become trapped in the oil town after failing to secure flights to other parts of the island and were making do with Togu, the equatorial monument, and $10 cups of civet coffee that are not as bad as the method of harvest would suggest. I’d been standing at the side of the dusty street for 10 minutes waiting to cross. Doing so here is a balancing act between your patience and suicidal tendencies. I was more patient than I thought. Eventually a man on a moped stopped. Julio offered to take me to Togu on the back of his scooter. Instead of taking me there, however, we went back to his family home for tea and pictures. We met more locals when a group of school children found us and asked if we’d help with their English homework. Of course we were happy to and spent a morning playing the roles of customers to their waiters and receptionists. They bought us t-shirts as a thank you. On one occasion I nipped out of the scorching sun into a mall to enjoy its air conditioning. As I wondered around I began to feel eyes upon me. I turned to see a group of kids, 30 or more, following me. I felt like the Pied Piper. When a few began to ask me for money I quickly exited, back into the heat and hustle. Related Articles

The saddle saga
26 Apr 2012
The busy streets of Pontianak were at odds with an Iban tribal longhouse we visited on our way to Brunei. The trip was arranged with Borneo Adventures’ guide, Juay. He was an exceptional guide and knowledgeable, not only about the Iban tribe, but the other tribes of Borneo; the Bidayuh and Orangulu. Our longhouse, deep in the forest, was built next to the Lemanak River and only reachable via a boat ride through it‘s shallow waters. Stairs lead up to a dimly lit communal area that stretched almost the length of a football field. Here we were welcomed with a shot of sweet rice wine called tuak. Leading off to the left were family rooms and to the right a raised platform, where we'd be sleeping that exited out to gardens of cocoa, pepper and rice. The Ngemahili Longhouse had 32 families living under the corrugated iron roof. Although the experience is meant for tourists, our hosts's way of life is no act. During the day the woman sat weaving baskets, chatting and watching over the children, while the men gathered food in the surrounding forest, harvested their crops or fished in the tranquil waters of the river. After a tuak-fuelled evening we accompanied Juay into the jungle in the cool of the morning where we found the male members of the tribe searching for food. One man had found some bats hiding in some bamboo - they were destined for the pot. We were taught how to shoot a blowpipe. We did hit the target but I doubt we’ll be hunting for our food any time soon. We’ll stick to the peanut butter sandwiches. Leaving the longhouse we made our way into the kingdom of Brunei and its small capital of Bandar Seri Begawan. There we met and were taken to dinner by Faten. She worked for the Brunei tourist agency and had some suggestions for us. Unfortunately, diving and golf were out of bounds with our budget. Our time in Borneo over, we headed back to Kuala Lumpur, where possible fame and fortune awaited us in the form of TV, radio and newspaper interviews about our trip so far. As it stands, we expect to reach Sydney in less than two months now. Matt McDonald and Andy Madeley are cycling from London to Sydney to raise money for War Child.
