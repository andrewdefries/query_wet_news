Democracy is being sacrificed in Europe
Lack of democratic accountability risks an eventual, and possibly extreme, populist backlash. Far from unifying Europe, the euro threatens eventual Balkanisation. Slavish adherence to the demands of monetary union has dislodged two elected prime ministers – George Papandreou, above, (gone) and Silvio Berlusconi (going) Photo: AFP/Getty	By Telegraph View

Slavish adherence to the demands of monetary union has succeeded in the past week in dislodging two democratically elected prime ministers – George Papandreou (already gone) and Silvio Berlusconi (not yet gone, but going). Elections in Spain will shortly sweep away Jose Zapatero, too. At least in that case, it will be via the ballot box, but the effect is much the same. In its struggle to stay alive, the single currency is exacting a heavy toll among Europe’s political leaders. Not that anyone will be shedding a tear for them. Like Zapatero, both Berlusconi and Papandreou would eventually have been removed by their electors if events hadn’t speeded up the process. What is more, many of the reforms that the largely technocratic governments replacing them are obliged to bulldoze through should have been implemented long ago: indeed, if they had been enacted during the good times, Europe wouldn’t be in quite the same mess as it is today. None the less, the virtual suspension of the democratic process that euro membership seems increasingly to demand should be viewed with alarm. Legitimacy, it appears, is expendable; the single currency is not. From the start, the march to European unification has always implied an erosion of sovereignty. But we seem to be reaching the point where the diktats of a small policy elite vastly outweigh the decisions of national parliaments. A particularly unhealthy development is the emergence of the “Frankfurt Group”, a shadowy collection of senior policymakers, to drive through the measures thought necessary to save the euro. Its reported make-up – Angela Merkel, Christine Lagarde, Nicolas Sarkozy, Mario Draghi, José Manuel Barroso, Jean-Claude Juncker, Herman van Rompuy and Olli Rehn, with external powerhouses such as Barack Obama occasionally allowed in by invitation – gives no reason for confidence. Nothing any of them has done to date has succeeded in stemming the crisis. On the contrary, their actions have often made matters worse. If the definition of madness is to do the same thing repeatedly and expect different outcomes, this collection of latter-day Napoleons would quickly be confined to the asylum. A policy agenda that has consistently failed is scarcely more likely to succeed if pursued more decisively and oppressively through a European equivalent of the Chinese Politburo. Few outsiders would dispute that Silvio Berlusconi has been a malign influence on Italy. But the fact that so many Italians chose to vote for him is not the root cause of the problem. Rather, it is that there is a divergence of at least 30 per cent in competitiveness between Europe’s south and north, which makes it virtually impossible for Italy to live with German fiscal and monetary policies. Rome’s curse is not so much bad government, as being in the wrong currency. The present policy prescription offers no way out, only grinding austerity and rising joblessness. Related Articles

The constraints of the single currency seem to be condemning much of Europe to virtual depression. Lack of democratic accountability, moreover, risks an eventual, and possibly extreme, populist backlash. Far from unifying Europe, the euro threatens eventual Balkanisation. Looking on in horror, Britain might seem to be well out of it. Yet everything that happens in Europe affects the UK directly. Thus far, for all his rhetoric, David Cameron appears to have been marginalised in these great debates, content to sit on the sidelines in the hope that the crisis will somehow be resolved. Yet whatever their end product – deeper union agreed by all 27 EU members, as Germany wants; the emergence of a separate “super-bloc” within the euro, as France wants; or the disintegration of the single currency itself – the discussions are of overwhelming importance to this country. With everything in flux, the Prime Minister has the opportunity that Britain has long craved to renegotiate our membership of the EU on better terms – yet at the moment, this country is being progressively frozen out of the key decision-making. We, and the other non-euro members, must act swiftly to safeguard our interests against increasingly undemocratic and economically unsound policy-making. As Europe slides inexorably into self-induced recession, time is running out. Telegraph View

Shady Characters by Keith Houston, review
Funny little symbols seem to have found a new lease of life in the internet age

The interrobang: a combination of the question mark and exclamation mark By Jon Day
7:00AM GMT 03 Nov 2013
Comments
The rise of the computer, and the hand-wringing that has accompanied the decline of handwriting, has made typographers of us all. What used to be a niche interest has gone mainstream. Writers have become interested not just in what words mean but in how they look on the page or screen. In 2010, Simon Garfield’s Just My Type, a book about the secret history of fonts, was a somewhat unlikely success. Now Keith Houston has written a book about what he calls typography’s “shady characters”: 10 more or less familiar punctuation marks, many of which we use unthinkingly every day. Though his selection feels slightly arbitrary, the stories he uncovers along the way are fascinating. Shady Characters takes in ancient Greek editors, medieval scribal practice, the invention of the printing press, the standardisation of punctuation brought about by the rise of the novel, the pernicious influence of the typewriter and the dawn of the “post-metal” (which is to say, digital) typographic age. Many of Houston’s shady characters are implicated in the triumph of technology over design. The pilcrow, ¶, which originated as the letter C (for capitulum), and was used in medieval manuscripts to mark space for a section break, has become largely invisible. It was doomed by the invention of the printing press, Houston argues, when the addition of extra characters by hand became too time-consuming to be worthwhile. Now it haunts word-processing software only on the “show/hide formatting” button, which “turns otherwise invisible spaces and line breaks into dots and yet more pilcrows, lending the average computerised document a dignified medieval appearance”. Other glyphs have become more rather than less familiar over time. One of the most engaging chapters in Shady Characters tells the story of the @ sign, or arobose (also known as the “elephant’s trunk”, “the snail”, “the monkey’s tail” and “the sleeping dog”). Originally a commercial mark signifying “at the rate of”, the symbol became ubiquitous after an engineer named Roy Tomlinson used it to differentiate between users and their locations in the new email system he’d invented for Arpanet, an early progenitor of the internet. Like the arobose, the octothorpe (#) rose to prominence due to its association with a new technology, when a Bell Labs employee decided to place it on the handsets of redesigned telephone keypads. Later it migrated to Twitter, where it’s used to tag trending topics. Related Articles

Houston is also interested in more obscure characters, the “cult punctuation marks” that are usually discussed only by typophiles. The manicule, or “bishop’s fist” – a playful little hand inserted into manuscripts to signal interesting or contentious content – was originally a reader’s mark. It survived the printing revolution but has since been largely overshadowed by more sober symbols. The “interrobang” is a combination of question and exclamation marks, which was invented by advertising executive Martin Speckter in 1962 to express a rhetorical combination of excitement and disbelief. It garnered some fame (perhaps because its inventor was an adman), and was included on a Remington typewriter and commended by typographers, or so the advertising bumf claimed, “for its ability to express the incredibility of modern life”. Despite this, it never really caught on. Houston goes on to discuss the history of the hyphen, the dash and the inverted comma, and concludes with an account of the various “sarcasm marks” that have been proposed over the years to flag irony. Online, “irony accounts for eight per cent of” conversation, Houston writes, and more and more we reach for emoticons to signal the fact that we’re not being quite straight with one another when we type. This is a self-defeating move. As the critic I A Richards pointed out: “If the quality of irony in a statement is such that it must be telegraphed to the reader, is it still ironic?” And what happens if an irony mark itself is used ironically? Unlike Eric Gill’s seminal Essay on Typography, Houston’s is not a polemical book. It’s written in a jaunty tone, laced with geeky relish. He’s not particularly interested in passing judgment, or in offering guidance on proper usage. The closest he comes to prescriptivism is in lamenting the dominance of the “hyphen minus”, the diminutive catch-all mark included on typewriter keyboards, which eroded the subtle differences between the various distinct dashes that preceded it. “In print and online, the well-set dash is an endangered species,” he writes. Other than that he’s generally tolerant of creative reappropriations of his beloved characters, something that makes Shady Characters quite refreshing. You can’t imagine Gill having much time for smileys ;) Shady Characters: Ampersands, Interrobangs and other Typographical Curiosities by Keith Houston 352pp, Particular, Telegraph Price £14.99 (PLUS £1.35 p&p) 0844 871 1515 (RRP £16.99, ebook £9.99) Follow @TelegraphBooks

Cleopatra, Northern Ballet, at Sadler's Wells, Seven magazine review
Northern Ballet’s production is a flat-pack affair that's unfit for a queen. Rating: * * What a carry on: clichés abound in "Cleopatra"
By Louise Levene
3:56PM BST 27 May 2011
Comments
Cleopatra’s career, with its blend of sexual conquest and world domination, used to be a mainstay of ballet, opera and epic cinema, but the Carry On team made it all but impossible to present the story with a straight face. The Cleo clichés are certainly out in force in David Nixon’s production for Northern Ballet, which had its London premiere at Sadler’s Wells. Carpet delivery? Check. Priceless-pearl-as-Alka-Seltzer? Check. Flexed feet and wrists? O lord, yes. Murderous reptile? You bet your sweet asp. The sets are commendably thrifty – a major consideration for a cash-strapped touring company. The same pillars and stairways do duty for both Egypt and Rome, but Nina Dunn’s projections offer a mimsy, pallid palette and the set has an insubstantial, flat-pack look, incompatible with imperial grandeur. The cut-price staging left money to splurge on an uninspired, all-purpose score by Les Miserables maestro Claude-Michel Schönberg, with an orchestration boasting more brass than a Maltese marching band – there were moments when I felt I was sitting in the trombonist’s lap. Nixon and his co-scenarist, Patricia Doyle, have crammed in as much plot as possible with the result that characters are underwritten and offer little for the performers to get their teeth into.

Martha Leebolt powers through the title role with impressive stamina, but her wardrobe of sporty playsuits make it hard to suggest majesty or mystique. The skimpy outfits leave her limbs free for the countless acrobatic duets with brothers, lovers and Wadjet, the snake god who lurks on the fringes looking uncannily like one of the old Doctor Who lizard people. Nixon’s best writing is found in these encounters between Cleopatra and her venomous nemesis (Kenneth Tindall). Wadjet is a symbol, not a love object, which forces Nixon to rein in the queasily literal couplings that blight his love duets. The remaining choreography is disappointing. The danse infernale unleashed by Caesar’s assassination that closed the first act had a sort of earthy vigour, but the other ensembles offered little in the way of “infinite variety”. The miniskirted Romans combined heavy footwork with the inevitable “hail Caesar” port de bras. Orgies come as standard in any balletic depiction of the ancient world and Nixon obliges with a ghastly ambisexual love-in between Anthony and sundry Egyptian rentfolk. Northern Ballet’s women are reduced to skipping about the place in primitive-pleated chiffon in a feeble job-creation scheme. (Bring on the dancing girls – on second thoughts: don’t.) Nixon is a peculiarly uneven choreographer and this is not his finest hour. Everyone admired the brio and originality of his backstage Midsummer Night’s Dream and the Regency wit and restraint of his Nutcracker (touring again this autumn) but other works have been marred by over-plotting (The Three Musketeers), poor taste (the Nazi Hamlet) or bizarre stagings (the terrible intergalactic Sleeping Beauty). His undeniable flair for box-office-friendly narrative dance may have kept the wolf from Northern Ballet’s door but pieces like Cleopatra make you want to tie a lamb to the letterbox.

What happened to the playground craze?
With the relaunch of the Tamagotchi, Josie Gurney-Read looks at what made a playground craze great: obviously, it was the time it took to be banned by teachers The first Tamagotchi, a small plastic toy on a keychain with a screen displaying basic graphics, was released in Japan in 1996 Photo: AP	By Josie Gurney-Read

They’re back – the digital pets that bleep irritatingly when death is imminent. Pixelated dogs, cats, dinosaurs and nondescript blobs that you would put your life temporarily on hold for when they demanded feeding and cleaning. It was a sad day when, skating at Funky Monkeys, my beloved Dino, who I had nurtured for all of a week, sprouted wings and disappeared from the screen. I could have cried, particularly as it wasn’t even my Tamagotchi; mine had, like so many others, made its way to a box in a staffroom, to be collected at the end of the half-term. >> IN PICTURES: Top 12 playground crazes I was, in fact, playing mother to the bleeping pet for my sister; a role filled by many actual mothers and fathers up and down the country when the school ban came into force. I blame Dino’s demise on the fact that my own mother refused to help out. No amount of protestation, highlighting the pet’s potential death could change her mind; it probably firmed up her decision to ignore me. Related Articles

Tamagotchi toy to be relaunched
25 Nov 2013
What followed was a heart breaking period of grief – mid-skate – as I mourned the demise of poor Dino. Ten minutes later, I pressed reset and moved on. Playground crazes, like Tamagotchi pets, never lasted long; but for the few short weeks that they went unnoticed by teachers, they had the ability to transform the playground experience. Marbles, scoubidous, football stickers, Tamagotchis and Pokémon; all have enjoyed at least one period on the playground, and in fact, most have enjoyed more than this. As with most trends, playground crazes move in cycles. This Boxing Day the Tamagotchi was relaunched by Bandai, having enjoyed its heyday in the UK in 1997, after its release in Japan in 1996. In total, the “game” sold more than 80 million units worldwide; no wonder Bandai wanted to give it another shot. But the Tamagotchi isn’t the only trend that has reappeared. The Yo-yo also seems to make a timely comeback every six years or so, having first come to real prominence on the playground in the 1960s. Now incorporating ball bearings and transaxles, the Yomega X-Brain – for beginners – includes what is described as a 4-way independent clutch axle that automatically returns the yo-yo when it slows to a certain speed. Along with the Duncan Pro-Yo, the X-Brain’s ability to ‘sleep’ allowed the user to perform complex tricks – although, as with most crazes, simply owning one was enough on the playground. While the objects involved in trends may evolve, it is the feelings they inspire on the playground that remain constant. Maybe I’m being sentimentally nostalgic, but let’s take Pokémon; you could purchase a starter pack and get a Shiny, and you could top up your deck with booster packs that could be secretly purchased from a newsagent. However, any child with a little nous could quickly start by blagging a few ‘spares’; eventually working their way up to the top via a series of smart and sometimes underhanded trades. Own a shiny, whether Pokémon or football sticker, and you would suddenly become the don of the playing field; everyone wanted to stand next to the guy or girl who had in their hand the hardest playground currency available – something to trade. 'Got, need, got, got, I've got five of him, got, no way; I can't believe you've got him'. This playground notoriety was fickle, but worth it for the hour it lasted. Like other crazes, football stickers – first created in 1961 by Panini – and Nintendo’s Pokémon cards were, for a short time, all that mattered in a school day. In fact, surveys of the late eighties and early nineties showed that over 90 per cent of nine to eleven-year-old boys purchased these stickers. Pokémon reported over 200 million cards sold in the UK alone, within the first 8 months of being launched in 1999. Going further back, during the 50s and 60s, marbles took centre stage on the playground. Rules generally changed depending who played – do crazes ever have fixed rules? – and value depended on the marble in question. The game, I am told, could be made a lot easier by bringing large ball bearings onto the scene, but the size would be taken into account when working out winnings. Do crazes exist in today’s schools? Certainly nothing has caught my attention; however, my almost complete separation from any child makes this assumption harder to establish. Moshi Monsters, I am told, were something of a ‘thing’ a few years back – along with the reappearance of scoubidous – before they too were banished to the blacklist of illegal items. It’s a shame. There was always a certain sense of camaraderie involved in the joint pursuit to trade or play ‘illegally’. Maybe that’s what gave many of the crazes their edge and appeal. However, despite the protestations and confiscations, each generation has a craze to remember; from Dinky Toys and slap bracelets, to pogs, tech decks and the somewhat lethal clackers – that required a skilled up-and-down hand motion to get the plastic balls to knock together. What’s certain is that the mark of a good craze was never about its longevity, it was the time it took to be banned in the playground. I doubt these new Tamagotchis even made it past the school gates last week; they might be a nightmare for teachers, but what unfulfilled potential. Check out the top 12 playground crazes in pictures

Terry Smith: 'We don't own bank shares and never will' Terry Smith, the founder of Fundsmith, has told investors that his fund will "never" own shares in banks, which might be "bust" but for bail-outs from the authorities.

Reporting a 12.5pc return on the Fundsmith Equity fund over the past year in his annual letter to investors, Mr Smith said central banks' quantitative easing had propped up the share prices of banks and other cyclical companies. He said the pledge by the head of the European Central Bank to do "whatever it takes" to save the euro was "likely to buoy the share prices of financial stocks, cyclical companies, those who might otherwise be bust, or at least in difficulty, and indeed a whole series of assets which we will never own in our fund". "We do not own any banks stocks and will never do so," he added. Mr Smith, who also heads Tullett Prebon, the broker, said the main contributors to the fund's outperformance in 2012 – its benchmark, the MSCI World index rose by 11.4pc – were Intercontinental Hotels, L'Oreal, drinks company Diageo, households goods maker Reckitt Benckiser and Kone, which makes lifts. The main detractors from the fund's performance were Procter & Gamble, McDonald's, Imperial Tobacco, medical suppliers Becton Dickinson, and "a consumer company which we are in the course of buying a position in and so would prefer not to name at this point".

Portfolio turnover in the fund in 2012 was just 0.48pc. Our only outright sale during the year was of SGS, the Swiss testing company. "We remain convinced that it and the sector are good quality businesses, but the shares had reached the point at which they were one of the most highly rated," Mr Smith said in his letter. Outright purchases for the year were Choice Hotels, Domino's Pizza, McDonald's, Visa and the unnamed consumer company. The fund finished the year with 28 holdings, up from 24 holdings at the end of 2011 – "towards the top end of our range". The average company in the portfolio was founded in 1902, against 1894 this time last year. Fundsmith Equity remains the best performing fund in the IMA Global Sector since inception to the end of December 2012. Mr Smith said he was "rather surprised" that the fund managed to outperform the market in 2012, as central banks' loose monetary policy tended to encourage investors to buy shares indiscriminately. Funds that have taken large positions in banks have generally outperformed due to the rally in shares prices in the sector since last summer. "All that liquidity has to go somewhere and indeed the supply of liquidity by central banks' purchases of bonds helps to push investors towards the purchase of riskier assets, as does the regime of record low interest rates."

I'm 35. Am I too old to be a bridesmaid?
Vicki and Octavia, our mother and daughter agony aunts, answer your questions 7:00AM GMT 20 Nov 2011
Comments
Send your 50-word dilemma to dearvickiandoctavia@telegraph.co.uk My younger brother has just announced his engagement to his long-term girlfriend and I could not be more delighted. Now my future sister-in-law has asked me to be one of her bridesmaids (making it clear I won’t have to do any administrative drudgery). But at 35 I wonder if I am too old for this role, especially as I’m single?
VICKI Traditionally, the bride’s ‘maids’ were her unmarried sisters, cousins and friends. In my lifetime, fashions in bridal attendants changed from flocks of children seething round the bride’s feet (à la Princess Diana) to the full American monty with rows of identically dressed bridesmaids and ‘groomsmen’ (as seen in Friends). She’s asked you; that’s sweet. Why not just go and support her? It’s not a huge role: a walk-on part, no lines to speak and a bit of bouquet-catching. As to being single – don’t you know how many people find partners at weddings?
OCTAVIA I can’t work out a cut-off point. Jennifer Garner was a maid of honour at 34, but you can probably break most rules with Ben Affleck on your arm. In the film Bridesmaids, three of the five ladies in pink were over 35 – but it’s fiction. P-Middy, well, let’s not even try and compete there. I’d say this: 2011 is the first year that it was reported that the average age for women to marry tipped 30. In 1981 it was 23. We do things older now. Go for it – show the world what a trendsetter you are

July 16, 2012: "The President and First Lady were attending the game between the US Men's Olympic basketball team and Brazil in Washington, DC. During the first half, the jumbotron flashed couples on their 'Kiss Cam', where they are then induced by the crowd to kiss each other. But neither the President or First Lady saw themselves when they were flashed on 'Kiss Cam', and some in the audience booed when they didn't kiss. At halftime, as we walked to the locker room to visit the US team, daughters Malia and Sasha asked their parents why they hadn't kissed during their 'Kiss Cam' moment. Both the President and First Lady said they hadn't even realised what had happened and didn't know why people were booing. So in the second half, when they appeared again on the 'Kiss Cam', the President leaned over to kiss the First Lady amongst audience cheers as Malia and the Vice President watched overhead on the jumbotron."Picture: Official White House Photo by Pete Souza

Nurse groped anaesthetised plastic surgery patients
A male nurse who groped patients as they recovered from breast enlargement surgery has been struck off the nursing register.

11:57AM BST 01 Oct 2012
Follow Gavin Nicholson sexually assaulted three women while they were at their most vulnerable and recovering from the affects of general anaesthetic, the Nursing and Midwifery Council Heard.
He preyed on them while they were receiving treatment at the private Spire Washington Hospital in Tyne and Wear.
Nicholson was convicted after trial at Newcastle Crown Court of three counts of sexual assault and the matter was subsequently referred to the NMC.
Having found that his fitness to practise was impaired by way of his convictions, the panel ordered that he be struck off the nursing register.
Panel chair Jennifer Laing said: "The panel had no information before it that Mr Nicholson has taken any steps to address his behaviour, or that he has accepted accountability for his actions.

"Without this information the panel concluded that there remains a real risk of repetition."
She added: "The panel considered that this order was necessary to mark the importance of maintaining public confidence in the profession, and to send to the public and the profession a clear message about the standard of behaviour required of a registered nurse.
"Further the criminal behaviour is so serious that it would not be appropriate to allow Mr Nicholson to remain on the register."
Clare Hennessy for the NMC told the hearing that Nicholson's actions came to light in September 2008 after a patient called the hospital to complain that the nurse had touched her pubic area on two different occasions.
The police were notified and during their investigations discovered that other patients had also had similar experiences with the retired RAF policeman.
"First of all the registrant persistently touched the breast of a patient in the recovery room and secondly he touched the pubic area twice of another patient," said Ms Hennessy.
"These offences were a gross breach of trust. Each victim was at their most vulnerable, powerless to protect herself against the registrant's indecent actions.
"They should have been at their safest as they recovered from their general anaesthetic, but they were not."
The women were assaulted as they were in the recovery room immediately after having surgery but Nicholson claimed they were merely suffering 'hallucinations' brought on by the effects of the anaesthetic.
One woman said she had been groped by Nicholson as he helped her put a sports bra on the day after her operation.
On July 19 last year, Nicholson of West Avenue, Harraton, Washington, was jailed for eight years for one count of sexual assault by penetration.
He was also sentenced to two concurrent five year terms of imprisonment for two counts of sexual assault and ordered to sign on to the sex offenders register for life.
Ms Hennessy added: "It is obvious that a woman who has been expecting to receive a high level of care from a nurse, who is then subject to a sexual assault is obviously going to be effected deeply, and no doubt, for a long time, if not forever."
Nicholson has 28 days to challenge the decision and an 18 month interim suspension order has been imposed to cover any appeal period. Crime

Angela Merkel: 'time to celebrate' election victory Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat Party secures a third term in office, after achieving their most resounding victory in 23 years. 9:35AM BST 23 Sep 2013
Merkel's conservatives won 41.5 per cent of the vote, finishing only five seats short of an absolute majority in the lower house. Depending on which parties end up in parliament, Merkel could find herself leading a "grand coalition" government with the left-leaning Social Democrats. During a speech made to supporters Ms Merkel said: "Together we will do everything to make sure these are successful years "it is too early to say exactly how we will proceed ... But toady we can celebrate, because we have done very well!"

Wikileaks: No 10 urged commander to play down Afghanistan failures
A senior adviser to Gordon Brown put pressure on the commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan to play down the “bleak and deteriorating” situation to reduce criticism of his government, leaked documents disclose.

Mr Brown, the prime minister at the time, visited the country and met Gen Stanley McChrystal, the US military commander, who described the growing threat posed by the insurgency and warned that the Afghan authorities faced a crisis of confidence. A cable states that a security adviser to Mr Brown told Gen McChrystal — with Mr Brown present — that his “bleak assessment” could result in negative press coverage. Gen McChrystal, who was later forced to resign, refused to back down. The cable, passed to The Daily Telegraph by the WikiLeaks website, states: “COMISAF [Gen McChrystal] replied that while he was sensitive to that impression, he would maintain his intellectual honesty – and that what might be perceived by some as a bleak assessment, might be considered by others to be 'realistic’.”
At the time, Mr Brown was under scrutiny over equipment shortages and the number of British soldiers being killed. He was being urged by Army chiefs to “get more boots on the ground”. The cable states: “COMISAF stressed that while the situation in Afghanistan was “serious and deteriorating”, the mission could still be accomplished with proper resources and a focus on ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces] expansion and partnering.

“Threats to security emanated from a resilient and growing insurgency, a crisis in confidence toward the government and its abilities and overall questions about Nato commitments. “COMISAF said that without additional resources, current efforts would be “fixed” – but with more resources, enough terrain could be controlled to deny the Taleban strategic traction.” The meeting was held at Camp Leatherneck in Helmand in August 2009. Mr Brown said that the British public needed to see more evidence of progress. “He repeated that the UK domestic audience needed to be able to judge successes 'month-to-month, not year-to-year’.”
Just over a month later Mr Brown attended a similar meeting in London with David Miliband, then foreign secretary, Gen McChrystal and Adml Mullen, US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Simon McDonald, then head of foreign and defence policy, asked the Americans to show “sympathy for the pressure” that Mr Brown was under. Mr Brown “repeatedly and forcefully” underscored the need for Afghan forces to play a much greater role. According to the cable, Mr Brown said his challenge was “persuading the British people that there was a way forward and not a stalemate”. It continues: “Given the lack of trained Afghan security forces and the casualties that UK forces are suffering, it is difficult to make that case presently. He repeated that there is a need for a much larger number of Afghan forces and they must become much more effective.”

USA face Belgium
10:03AM BST 21 Jul 2003
Comments
Chanda Rubin and Meghann Shaughnessy showed America's strength in depth as the USA completed a 5-0 whitewash against Italy in Washington DC. The win set up a Federation Cup semi-final clash with Belgium as the USA reached the last four for the first time in three years. Victory was sealed for the Americans when Rubin beat Francesca Schiavone 5-7, 6-4, 6-0 in the third rubber to give the home team an unassailable 3-0 lead. And the rout was completed when Shaughnessy won her dead rubber with Rita Grande 6-3, 7-5 and Lisa Raymond and Alexandra Stevenson, who replaced Rubin, won the doubles in straight sets against Antonella Serra Zanetti and Tathiana Garbin. With the Williams sisters missing through injury, US captain Billie Jean King was delighted with the performance of her stand-in players. King said: "We're so fortunate to have this many great women players. It's a fantastic accomplishment by all of them." In Charleroi, Kim Clijsters was at her ruthless best as Belgium clinched their place in the last four with a 5-0 whitewash over outgoing champions Slovakia. The world number two was an emphatic 6-0, 6-1 winner over Janette Husarova, to move Belgium into an 3-0 lead in the best-of-five tie against last year's surprise winners. Like Clijsters, Justine Henin-Hardenne repeated her feat of Saturday by winning her singles match, this time a comfortable 6-2, 6-1 win over Eva Fislova. Els Callens and Caroline Maes then completed the match with a 6-4, 7-5 triumph in the doubles against Jarmila Gajdosova and Lubomira Kurhajcova. In the bottom half of the draw, France and Russia will lock horns after both were impressive winners in the last eight. France beat their hosts Spain 4-1, with Amelie Mauresmo building on a 3-0 overnight lead with victory over Magui Serna 7-5, 6-2 in the final singles match. Spain restored some pride when Anabel Medina Garrigues and Virginia Ruano Pascual defeated Nathalie Dechy and Emilie Loit 6-4, 6-4, in the dead rubber doubles match. Russia, leading 2-0 after the first day's play in Portoroz, completed a 5-0 triumph over Slovenia in fine style. Elena Bovina beat Katarina Srebotnik in the first singles of the day 7-6 (7/4), 6-2, before Vera Zvonareva saw off Maja Matevzic 6-1, 6-2. Elena Dementieva and Anastasia Myskina completed the whitewash by winning 6-2, 6-3 against Katarina Srebotnik and Tina Pisnik in the doubles. Sport

World Cup 2010: Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi buoyed by Argentina's success Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona on Sunday looked back with satisfaction at their opening World Cup win over Nigeria. Dream team: Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona share a moment of affection after their 1-0 win over Nigeria Photo: REUTERS	By Telegraph staff and agencies
7:10PM BST 13 Jun 2010
A 1-0 success thanks to Gabriel Heinze's header means Argentina look well-poised to advance from Group B where South Korea also beat a feeble-looking Greece and the three points were a tonic after Maradona's men had struggled to qualify. "We are right in there in the mix," Maradona insisted while praising Messi for an enterprising showing which on another day would have seen a much larger winning margin. "I want to see Leo hug the ball. We enjoy ourselves when he does that. Football would not be beautiful were it not for seeing Messi do wonderful things," said Maradona. Messi praised team-mates Juan Veron, Angel Di Maria and Javier Mascherano for doing the deeper work which allowed him to put the Nigerians under pressure. "They let me play," said the Barcelona star, who was in the thick of most of Argentina's attacking moves as he partnered Gonzalo Higuain and Carlos Tévez in a three-pronged attack. Related Articles

Despite their laboured path to the finals Argentina are now utterly focused on the job of landing their third crown after 1978 and 1986, says Messi, who finally looks ready to transfer his Barcelona form to the international arena. "I had more contact with the ball. We created many chances on goal and didn't have the luck to convert. But we played really well and we are going to carry on in that vein. The important thing was to start with a win." Argentina are blessed with a wealth of attacking talent so it was somewhat ironic that a defender netted their goal. Nonetheless, says Messi, eager to show the side are definitely not a one-man band, "we have loads of very good players in the squad – any of them can win a match for us, myself included." He admitted that "we had a few awkward moments in the qualifiers – not just me but all of us". "But against Nigeria we created so many chances. I think Argentina have been creating more chances than anyone so far, though we didn't finish them off. Yet we are happy with the way things are going and will take it from there." A small cloud on the immediate horizon with South Korea to come on Thursday, is the fitness of veteran midfielder Veron, who went off midway through the second half. Medical staff diagnosed a calf muscle strain but he is expected to recover in time to face the South Koreans. If not, then the man who replaced him, Maxi Rodriguez, could make the starting eleven at Soccer City. Argentina

Daniel Biddle, 7/7Bomb victim, has high hopes for 2012 Paralympics
It was the morning of July 7 2005, only hours after London had won the right to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012, and the euphoria was subsiding. Daniel Biddle woke late, with a headache, at his east London home, and headed in to work.
Hitting the weights: Daniel Biddle, who lost his legs in the Edgware Road tube bomb on 7/7, is aiming for a place at 2012 Paralympic in London Photo: GRAHAM BOOL	By Gareth A Davies 10:34PM BST 15 Oct 2008
Comments
He missed trains, his breakfast, and through a curious series of incidents, broke the routine of his regular journey to work as a project manager for a construction company. His misfortune was to find himself sitting on the Tube train, next to the suicide bomber who blew himself up along with seven other people at Edgware Road station at 9.17am. In total, 52 commuters lost their lives in the rush-hour attack and over 700 were injured. Biddle, now 29, lost both legs, his left eye and later, in hospital, his spleen as his powerful body absorbed the blast and was blown out through the Tube carriage and into the tunnel wall. On Wednesday, if catharsis is possible from such a horrific moment, the horrendous injuries which followed, and what must be painfully difficult memories, his life came full circle when he tried out at a Paralympic Talent Day at Mile End Stadium with 70 other hopefuls all aiming to be fast-tracked into the Great Britain team for 2012. It is hard to keep a dry eye as Biddle relates, emotionless, his story of travelling to a meeting in Wembley that morning from east London. "I was late leaving home, my bus was delayed at Liverpool Street. I let the first tube go because it was packed. I was texting a colleague when I got on the next train, and I've got big fingers and I'm useless at texting, and looked up and realised I had missed my usual station. As we pulled into Edgware Road, I looked around me. A youngish-looking Asian guy was sitting on a seat next to me. Then bang – I couldn't work out why I was outside the train. "As the dust settled, there were body parts all around me. I knew then it was a bomb. A flap of skin on my head was hanging down over my face, my arms were on fire. I tried to move the train door off my legs, but I realised they had gone. "If there is a hell, then that was it. I was absolutely terrified – it wasn't the dying, it was dying alone. I didn't want my girlfriend Lisa, now my wife, and my family to have to identify me in that state. Three men got me out, saved my life, and we are still friends."
He was in a coma for six weeks, in hospital for 51 weeks. "A year was a benchmark for me. I wanted to get out of there before a year. It was a turning point."
Biddle was 6ft 4in tall, a semi-professional footballer who played in goal for Hatfield Peverel in the Essex Premier League, before the terrorist bomb blew off his legs. He is still a big man, with powerful upper-body strength. Biddle tried out yesterday in the Paralympic sports of shot putt, power lifting, and in archery, which, as he is right-handed and still has the vision of his right eye, is still potentially a sport he could excel at. The sports centre is a stone's throw from the Olympic Park. "You know, I watched the Paralympic Games from Beijing, on TV every night in September, and thought about competing in 2012. My manor, east London. I don't think I will ever accept what possessed that person to do that thing, but I have accepted who I am now. "You've got to focus on what you can do, not what you can't do. You get to a point where you get your life back, and this is now what my life is. "I've finished my exams, I've gone back to work, I drive, I go to the gym, I use a sports chair. I'm the same person, still a loud-mouthed cockney," he joked. Then he got serious. "I just hope the selectors for the Paralympic Games saw something in me today, and I hope I'm good enough to get into the team."
Daniel Biddle Paralympic gold medallist, perhaps? "Oh, I do like the sound of that," he replied. When the celebration parade travels through London today, we might just say a silent prayer for the events of the anniversary, one day later. Paralympic Sport

Juzcar, Spain
The town of Juzcar, in Spain's Malaga province, is equally eye-catching. In 2011, all its buildings were painted blue in a stunt to promote the Smurfs movie. An estimated 80,000 tourists visited in the following six months and residents voted to retain the town's cheery makeover. Picture: GETTY

My post-natal depression: I wanted to throw my baby on the floor
After it was revealed that Miriam Carey, the woman who was shot dead last week outside the US Senate, had post-natal depression, a fellow sufferer Gill Tones explains how the illness takes control. Image 1 of 2	A fifth of the women identified in the Chicago study as having depression also had bi-polar disorder Photo: Alamy	Image 1 of 2	Dental hygenist Miriam Carey was shot dead by police after police placed Capitol Hill in Washington. It was later revealed she was suffering from post-natal depression. Photo: ENTERPRISE NEWS	By Gill Tones
11:15AM BST 07 Oct 2013
There’s a woman sitting in a high-backed chair in a hospital room at about four in the morning. It’s all very quiet, apart from the constant gentle buzz of some machine or other. She’s wondering why she is having thoughts about flinging her new born baby from her arms down onto the hard, cold floor. Why there’s no strength inside her that she can draw on to push these thoughts away. Above all, whether, as these thoughts are so persistent, she actually wants to do it. She’s terrified out of her wits. Yes, that was me. This happened in January earlier this year and I have been back to my ‘normal’ self for a good few months now. If my story says anything, it’s that a person suffering with peri and post-natal depression can sometimes be cured in a relatively short period of time, with the correct treatment. I don't know any personal details about Miriam Carey, the 34 year-old American woman killed last week, in a flurry of police bullets outside the US Senate after driving towards Congress and becoming ensnared at a security checkpoint. But I, and the world over, now know from her mother that she was suffering from post-partum depression after giving birth to her daughter, Erica, last August. Anybody can be suddenly thrust into this twilight world of terror and remain stuck there day after long day without help. I feel very lucky that I asked for help, or I might still be there today. Things might have turned out very differently for me and my family. Related Articles

New £10 test to identify post-natal depression risk
02 Jul 2013
On top of my post-natal illness I was suffering from what seems to be quite a common occurrence in women who are either pregnant or who have recently given birth – obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Contrary to the general understanding of OCD, there was no hand washing involved; rather, it was the constant bombardment of horrifying thoughts, the weariness of trying to fight them off or ignore them, and just the feeling that something was very wrong. I tried very hard to be the ‘normal’ me but I became reclusive, a prisoner of panic, shaking, crying on occasion; this was before I had even given birth. It came like a slap in the face at seven months pregnant and remained until I sought help about 10 weeks later. It became clear that this wasn’t just a case of the ‘baby blues’. I was fearful of spending any time with my baby and my older son because I didn’t trust myself not to hurt them. Looking back, it was the love that I had for them that perpetuated this fear, but at the time I couldn’t feel that emotion, or any emotion. I certainly felt like a bad mum. When my husband returned to work after his three weeks of paternity leave, my mum came to stay. It was as if I wanted to be policed. And constantly, in my mind, I was asking ‘What if I…?’ ‘Am I capable of…?’ I lost the feeling of self that we take for granted and without that, I didn’t know who I was or what I might end up doing. I blurted it all out to my midwife and, although I felt like a complete freak, there was also a little relief. From that day, I realised that I wasn’t actually ashamed of myself; I was ill. A wonderful male nurse at our local GP surgery took one look at me and prescribed beta-blockers to quickly counteract the panic symptoms and an antidepressant which took a few weeks to begin to work but which was successful. Counselling was also arranged, as the nurse suggested that both were of huge importance. I ended up seeing a cognitive behavioural therapist for about two months. My therapist told me that everything I said was confidential, unless she thought that I was a danger to myself or others. ‘Well,’ I thought, ’no doubt they’ll take the children away when I say what thoughts are running through my head.’ But I did speak my mind and, lo and behold! What I thought was a unique problem with me was actually a blueprint for post-natal illness. Not only that, but I vaguely remember the figure of 20 per cent being bandied about. I’m no medical expert but that seems like an awful lot of women suffering the same scary thoughts; a chemical imbalance probably brought on by hormones during pregnancy. Very common, actually. I cried with relief and the children remained where they were – with a recovering me. Over a seemingly long time, I grew well again. I could eat and drink again. At some point, I began to feel like my old self but I can’t give you the date because when life begins again and you almost take your ‘normal’ self for granted. Obviously, until you lose it. We MUST be so pleased when we have a healthy child, mustn’t we? Society says so. But what society so often doesn’t realise is that we can’t always feel what we are supposed to – sometimes, we can’t feel anything. My story ultimately is a happy one. I know what it feels like to lose yourself and live in dread. But I also know what it is to come out of that dark place. Now I am training to become a counsellor in this field so I can help other women, or their partners, who find themselves in a similar situation. If you are like the woman holding the baby, seek help. Don’t be ashamed. There is no point in trying to correct a chemical imbalance by yourself – how would you start? You are normal, you are worthy, you maybe just need a little help. Mother Tongue
