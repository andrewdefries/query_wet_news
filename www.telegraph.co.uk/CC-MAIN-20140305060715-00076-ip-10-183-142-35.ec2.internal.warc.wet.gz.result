'Now I am awake'
Will Cohu reviews Forever Today by Deborah Wearing
Will Cohu
12:01AM GMT 30 Jan 2005
Comments
It is 20 years since the conductor Clive Wearing woke up from a fevered sleep with the most severe case of amnesia ever documented. A freak dose of herpes simplex – the innocuous virus that causes cold sores – had wreaked havoc with the temporal lobes of his brain. Clive could remember how to read music, he could remember things that had happened years before, but he had no consciousness of what had just happened. Life became an agonising, ceaseless reawakening, which he documented in his diaries: 7:46am I WAKE FOR THE FIRST TIME7:47am THIS ILLNESS HAS BEEN LIKE DEATH TILL NOW ALL SENSES WORK 8:07am I AM AWAKE 8:31am NOW I AM AWAKE 9:06am NOW I AM AWAKE 11:37am NOW I AM PERFECTLY COMPLETELY AWAKE (1st TIME) Deborah Wearing stuck with her husband through 10 years of this. It must have been awful to witness such confusion engulfing someone she loved but, despite his condition, Clive was still Clive – "living evidence that you could lose almost everything you ever knew about yourself and still be yourself" – and he loved her above all else. This was a mixed blessing, for she could not free herself from him, and his infantile dependence dominated her life. It sounds as if he had always been somewhat dependent. Clive, who was nearly 20 years older than Deborah, was talented but scatty and perverse in his career choices. She met him when she sang in one of the choirs he conducted; their relationship was emotionally profound but financially precarious and geared towards Clive's choices. After he became sick, Deborah abandoned her own life, immersing herself in neuropsychology and founding a charity for amnesia sufferers. Clive was the subject of films and conferences, and Deborah was in the undesirable position of having a career made on the back of her husband's illness. Inevitably, she cracked. Leaving Clive in hospital, she obtained a divorce and fled to America. She tried acting, creative writing and performance poetry and had a couple of unsatisfactory affairs with damaged Vietnam veterans masquerading as sensitive sorts. It's a section of the book that makes uncomfortable reading; Deborah, who writes beautifully about her husband, is uncomfortable when exploring herself; it's as if she can't get the perspective right – is she comic or tragic? – and her images have an over-compensatory tenderness. In one disastrous moment of empathy, she compares herself to Jackie Kennedy with her husband's brains all over her, holding "that most private of all her husband's parts wetting her white cotton glove until someone took it from her at the hospital". In the end, the constant in her life was Clive, who still loved her, and called her back to him with heart-breaking sincerity. She returned to England, took a job and renewed her marriage vows. "Perhaps it is only when the rest of life comes apart that the strength of love becomes visible," she concludes. But how was she able to resign herself to this curtailed life? Towards the end of this remarkable, bemusing story, there is a disquieting passage. In a couple of paragraphs, Deborah describes how, one miserable day, she asked a Christian friend to pray for her and felt the Holy Spirit come down the telephone wire "like a force and like honey". Thereafter, it all became simple. "I wasn't alone," she writes. Faith gave her power and she began to see "deep changes in Clive" as she prayed for him. Her religious experience casts a retrospective shadow on her narrative, which seems to have been leading to her conversion. Even Clive's constant awakening is the intimation of a greater resurrection. Once introduced, religion takes control of a story like this and reduces human experience to metaphor. Her prayers may well have helped Clive but, equally, his partial recovery, to the point where he is able to recognise his problems and compensate, is testament to the human potential for painful, ingenious self-creation. And it is testament to her extraordinary strength and fidelity to the man. There is also a sense of the divine at work that is not always benign. For in a peculiar way, Deborah Wearing did get what she wanted. She describes how her early days with Clive were soured by her jealousy of his previous marriage and old girlfriends. She wanted him to have known no one before her, and her wish was granted. Deborah did become Clive's first, last and only love, and it was unbearable. Books

Stop buying our bond funds, M&G tells investors Fund manager's unprecedented move follows fears that the corporate bond market is in the midst of a liquidity crisis.

Investors are being warned off Britain's biggest and most successful corporate bond funds amid fears that liquidity in the sector could dry up, causing a drag on performance and locking investors into poorly performing funds.
Last week, M & G, the pioneer of bond funds and manager of the top-performing £6.2bn Corporate Bond fund and £5.1bn Strategic Corporate Bond fund, held a telephone conference call with influential financial advisers urging them not to put any more of their clients' money its way.
M & G is also understood to have turned down £1bn worth of business for institutional corporate bond funds. The move to stem inflows into the funds came just days after the Financial Services Authority wrote to corporate bond fund managers asking for a review of liquidity in the sector and whether the situation could result in investors being denied access to their money. "Liquidity risk" is the danger that when you need to sell a bond, you won't be able to.
The warning will sound alarm bells for tens of thousands of risk-averse savers who have piled into bond funds since January amid the economic turmoil. They have poured more than £4bn into corporate bond funds, which have outsold all other types of fund in five of the past six months.

The FSA letter read: "We wish to understand better the ability of funds to meet potential redemption demands. We understand that the liquidity of many of the instruments in which such funds invest may be sufficiently low to make large trades difficult without material trading costs. "Concerns have been raised with us that market liquidity has the potential to be impacted further as a result of the implementation of future global regulations. The market for these funds has been strong in recent years, and we wish to understand the extent to which a reversal of this trend could create risks for investors."
Chris Bowie, fixed-interest manager at Ignis, admitted that it was a "very challenging time" for bond managers. Mr Bowie, who told Telegraph readers last month that investors should not be buying bonds right now, said: "Prior to the banking crisis I could have turned over my portfolio in three months – now it takes much longer," he said. "Instead of being able to push through £150m in a day you have to stagger it, £3m here, £4m there. You have to manage positions much more slowly."
The reduced liquidity is caused in part by investment banks having significantly less capital to allocate to corporate bond trades. Owing to regulation and reduced cash flow, investment banks have just a quarter of the cash they had 12 months ago for trades, making it harder for managers to sell bonds in the market.
Add to this a significantly reduced number of new bond issues and you can see why liquidity has become an issue.
"If we have a eurozone banking crisis and there is a rush for redemptions, we could see a similar liquidity crisis to the one experienced by the commercial property market in 2008," said Mr Bowie. "Investors simply won't be able to access their cash."
Artemis bond manager James Foster agreed. "If there is a rush for the door, caused either by a rise in interest rates or by problems in the eurozone, you would potentially be faced with a redemption freeze, as there would be no bond buyer on the other side," he said.
Five years ago, tens of thousands of investors were stuck in commercial property funds because liquidity dried up – managers couldn't sell holdings and investors were forced to wait up to six months to get their money out. Hefty exit fees were also applied.
Ian Spreadbury, who runs the £3bn Fidelity Moneybuilder Income fund, the fourth largest corporate bond fund in Britain, said he held a "liquidity bucket" in his portfolio, made up of cash and gilts. "In a situation when there were substantial outflows, if you were fully invested in corporate bonds you would struggle to pay investors," he said.
Financial advisers are warning their clients off investing new money in the sector, while those already in the funds are advised not to panic but to keep an eye on the situation.
"At the moment, trading desks are telling us that demand for quality credit is still outstripping supply and liquidity in sterling terms is challenging," said Brian Dennehy of FundExpert.co.uk. "This liquidity squeeze is continuing to drive down the yield on quality credit, forcing prices up, and looks set to continue for a while yet."
Gary Potter, a fund of funds manager at Thames River Capital, said: "Corporate debt total return is not compelling by any means versus other asset classes. It is harder to manage these bond funds compared with when they were small and performance can be compromised – the bigger the oil tanker, the harder it is to turn around."
M & G moved to play down its decision. Richard Woolnough, who runs the two funds, rejected liquidity concerns, claiming that the group simply wanted to discourage inflows so that he could continue to "effectively execute" his ideas. "We are looking to the future and to do the best by our existing investors," he said. Featured Isa / Investment platforms »
