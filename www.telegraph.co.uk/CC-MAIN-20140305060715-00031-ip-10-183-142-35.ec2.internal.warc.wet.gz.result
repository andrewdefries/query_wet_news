Les Misérables, review
On second viewing Robbie Collin is still convinced Anne Hathaway's performance in Tom Hooper's Les Miserables will be an Oscar-winner.

Dir: Tom Hooper; Starring: Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter. 12A cert, 158 min.
When I first saw the new film version of Les Misérables a month ago I was sufficiently awestruck to give it five stars, but was curious this week as to whether I would be quite so bowled over on a second, cooler-headed viewing. Now I am slightly concerned that another month will ever pass in which I will be able to stop myself rewatching it.
Tom Hooper’s thunderclap revamp of the long-running stage show, based in turn on Victor Hugo’s doorstop of a novel, is cinema as battering ram: it slams into your gut 24 times a second until all you can do is roll over and roar along.
A still from Les Miserables
Hooper, hot off The King’s Speech, has made an enormous musical of enormous songs, sung by some of the most enormous-looking faces to have ever appeared on a cinema screen. During a close-up of Hugh Jackman at the prologue’s climax, I could have comfortably curled up inside one of the actor’s nostrils. Then Jackman whinnies his climactic high C and the camera spirals up into the clouds, borne on the wings of Claude-Michel Schönberg’s rollicking score. Well, sorry, but if this stuff doesn’t get you going, your heart must be pumping cold porridge.

Hathaway: Les Mis is 'dream job'
06 Dec 2012
France, 1815: Louis XVIII is restored to power and the Revolution is a distant memory. Jackman is Jean Valjean, a chain gang slave who skips parole to reinvent himself as mayor of Montreuil. He is thereby caught up in the tragic story of Fantine (Anne Hathaway), a seamstress who falls on hard times, and her angelic daughter Cosette (Isabelle Allen). Meanwhile, the iron-willed lawman Javert (Russell Crowe) vows to bring Valjean to justice. History surges towards the Paris Uprising of 1832, and the ever-swelling cast of characters – Amanda Seyfried as the adult Cosette, Eddie Redmayne as Marius, her sweetheart on the barricades, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as a pair of villainous publicans – hang on, and sing on, for dear life.
Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean
Hooper’s masterstroke was to make his cast sing live on set, rather than lip-sync to prerecorded studio tracks. This is not quite the innovation it has been sold as (live singing in musicals was standard practice in Hollywood until the mid-1930s), but in a film where almost all of the dialogue is set to music, it gives those words a raw, dramatic vitality, and the odd bum note is a price worth paying.
The payoff is never greater than in Hathaway’s half-sung, half-sobbed performance of I Dreamed A Dream, which Hooper captures in a single, mesmeric four and a half-minute take. The nod to Maria Falconetti’s brimming eyes and bottomless pathos in The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) is howlingly immodest, and yet Hathaway lives up to it. I’ll say it again: this will be the clip they show before she wins her Oscar.
Anne Hathaway as Fantine
While Hathaway has been rightly singled out, the entire cast is a joy: even Crowe, who generally lands within spitting distance of the note he is aiming at. Samantha Barks as Éponine and young Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche are two welcome imports from the West End production, and Bertie Carvel is a hoot as a seamy boulevardier. And then there is Redmayne, who swoops on screen in a flash of lips and cheekbones and breaks every heart in the cinema. During One Day More, when he sings “My place is here, I fight with you,” the line runs you through like a Rada-polished bayonet.
Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried
Why does this work? Modern cinemagoers have no more common ground with Marius’s rather glamorised plight than they do with, say, Iron Man or the Incredible Hulk, and yet I found myself sobbing along with the rest of the auditorium.
This reaction has been pooh-poohed by some American critics, who made the mistake of trying to engage with the film as drama. Les Misérables is a blockbuster, and the special effects are emotional: explosions of grief; fireballs of romance; million-buck conflagrations of heartbreak. Accordingly, you should see it in its opening week, on a gigantic screen, with a fanatical crowd. There is a strong possibility I may be among them. Crying, probably.

Coroner criticises supermarket cheap alcohol after fatal '£10' binge
A coroner has criticised supermarkets for selling alcohol cheaper than bottled water after a man in Norfolk died after consuming as little as £10 worth of drink.
A substantial number of deaths are now linked to alcohol abuse Photo: Abbie Trayler-Smith	By Alastair Jamieson
10:20AM GMT 21 Jan 2010
Follow William Armstrong, the Greater Norfolk coroner, made his comments at hearing into the death of Roger Prosser, 64, who was found to have a blood-alcohol level more than six time the drink-drive limit when he collapsed and died. Tests showed he had a level of almost 500 milligrams of alcohol im his blood; the legal limit for drivers is 80. Mr Armstrong said: "The huge amount that he drank could have been purchased at a supermarket for around £10. It is alarming that alcohol can be purchased at supermarkets at a price less than bottled water. "One of the witnesses said told me that wine and cider were Mr Prosser's poison – sadly that proved to be literally as well as metaphorically true." Earlier this week, the Government unveiled new measures to cut down on irresponsible drinking in England and Wales, including a ban on all-you-can-drink promotions and a move to force bars and pubs to offer smaller glasses of wine.

The Conservatives have also promised to review the "open all hours" policy introduced by the Government. However, moves in Scotland to set a minimum price for alcohol in supermarkets – which offer lager for as little as 25p a can and wine for £2.50 a bottle – have faltered. Mr Armstrong first attacked low-price drink offers last July after he dealt with three inquests into alcohol-related deaths. He said then: "The cost of alcohol is a factor – because it is so cheap it is not a costly business to get drunk. It has become an entrenched part of our culture not just among the young but older people as well. "In my role I deal with death and disaster every day but I am still surprised and shocked by the extent of excessive alcohol consumption going on and the effect it is having – it is a major public health problem."This week's hearing in Norwich into the death of Mr Prosser, who lived in Loddon, Norfolk, was told that he had been a heavy drinker for more than 30 years. Mr Armstrong said:"A substantial number of deaths are now linked to alcohol abuse – and there is a relationship between the cost of alcohol and the damage that abuse causes. Doing something about this should be a priority." Retail and Consumer

Cold weather has killed 37 people in Ukraine so far this month as temperatures reached minus 23 Celsius in parts of the former Soviet republic. Night temperatures are expected to drop to -28C in northern, central and eastern Ukraine this week. The cold snap followed heavy snowfall which left some areas covered with as much as 53 cm (21 inches) of snow. Cars were blocked for 18 kilometres (11 miles) overnight on Saturday on the main road between the capital Kiev and Lviv, officials said. Picture: REUTERS/Marian Striltsiv

Wind farms are a 'blot' on 'God's creation', says bishop
Winds farms have become a “blot” on the face of “God’s creation” and are threatening to destroy a landscape where saints once trod, a bishop warns today. Where saints once trod: Lindisfarne in Northumberland By John Bingham, Religious affairs Editor
6:00AM BST 25 Sep 2013
Follow The Bishop of Newcastle, the Right Reverend Martin Wharton, whose diocese in Northumberland includes some of the most dramatic countryside in England, is calling for a moratorium on allowing any more wind farms in the county. In a strongly worded article published today, he warns that, far from fending off global warning, the rapid spread of giant wind turbines in the area is beginning to have a “massive environmental impact”. While acknowledging the need to find new, more sustainable sources of energy, he says there are now “critical questions” over whether wind farms will even reduce carbon emissions. Bishop Wharton is the first leading figure in the Church to breaks ranks with an unofficial consensus strongly favouring wind energy and believing that climate change must be combated at any almost cost. Last year the Diocese of Exeter was forced to withdraw plans to erect turbines on its land in Devon after parishioners protested and there was similar opposition over plans by other dioceses.

In 2010 the Church Commissioners announced that they were actively exploring options to expand wind and solar power generation on its large land holdings. Just last week an Anglican pressure group called for the Church to shun any investments involving fossil fuels in the same way as it does the arms industry or pornography. But Bishop Wharton, who has a reputation as one of the most down to Earth figures in the Church hierarchy, said it was now time to recognise the “harm” wind energy is inflicting on the landscape. Writing jointly for his diocesan magazine “Link” and the Newcastle Journal, he says that it has now become impossible to ignore the increasing numbers of turbines on hilltops. “It is a basic Christian truth that we all have a duty and a responsibility to care for and exercise wise stewardship over God’s creation, which has been entrusted to us,” he writes. “The danger is that in parts of Northumberland our landscape is becoming marred and disfigured and turned into one industrial site after another.” In a reference to the Northumbrian saints such as Bede, Cuthbert and Hilda, he continues: “We are blessed to live in an area of outstanding natural beauty. “We enjoy a wonderful physical and spiritual heritage in this land of the Northern Saints. “Is now not the time to say ‘enough’” to any further blots on our landscape?” He adds: “Whilst we all recognise the need for a greater reliance on sources of renewable energy, there are critical questions to be asked not only about the efficiency of wind turbines in general but also about the massive environmental impact that the significant growth and cumulative effect that wind farms are having in Northumberland. “There is no evidence that I have seen that suggests that wind farms will ever provide the reliable, controllable energy that is required by our society, however many there might be. "Furthermore some studies have even suggested that far from reducing CO2 emissions, wind farms actually increase them.” Religion

Australia banking on David Pocock returning to lift fortunes against England at Twickenham on Saturday
The good news for Australia and, after this pasting at the Stade de France, they could certainly use some, is that coach Robbie Deans should have a full complement of players to choose from when he picks the side to face England at Twickenham on Saturday.

David Pocock, Ben Alexander and Sitaleki Timani were absent from the pack while Digby Ioane was missing from the backs, all suffering from the lingering effects of a tough Four Nations. On this evidence, Deans will have little hesitation in bringing them all in to face Stuart Lancaster’s side. The word is that Pocock may not be 100 per cent fit until the final match against Wales but, even at 75 per cent, he seems certain to start on the flank against England, so poor was this Australian performance. The Wallabies were a shadow of the side who blitzed France 59-16 two years ago on a night when they humiliated the French pack. The home side had not forgotten that night, indeed the coach Philippe Saint-Andre used it as motivation during the preparations, and the forwards, in particular, were determined to reclaim their machismo. This time it was Australia, with an average 8lb per man advantage in the front row, who were shunted around like schoolboys on ice by a pack that included two new caps in prop Yannick Forestier and lock Joceline Suta and a back row missing two of their all-time greats, Thierry Dusautoir and Imanol Harinordoquy. “Our set-piece was part of the challenge and the effectiveness of the French around the contact meant we had no momentum, so when we tried to play to width in the second half, it was ineffective,” Deans said. “In terms of the scrum, the French grew in confidence, just like their game.”

Two of France’s three tries came from their pack’s ability to torment the Wallabies in the tight. No 8 Louis Picamoles got the first after rolling off the side of a wheel and ghosting through a gap the size of the Tasman Sea, while the last of them was a humiliating penalty try. The other was a wonderful piece of back play from Frederic Michalak, who kicked 15 points, and Wesley Fofana. “England will look to bring the same sort of pressure and try to shut us down,” admitted Deans, whose job prospects may come under renewed pressure if there is a similar outcome at Twickenham. Saint-Andre knew how the victory was forged. “We produced a great defence, moving up quickly and were very aggressive at the ruck,” he said. “That was the key to the match.” It was their biggest win over Australia since they walloped them 34-6 in 1976 when a try, remember, was worth only four points, and their first against the Wallabies since 2005. “I’ve told my players to enjoy the win because it’s not often you beat Australia, especially by 30 points,” added Saint-Andre.
