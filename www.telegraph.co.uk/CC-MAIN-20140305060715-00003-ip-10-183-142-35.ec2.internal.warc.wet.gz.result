Gary McKinnon: British hacker to be extradited
Gary McKinnon, the British hacker who infiltrated American military websites searching for proof of alien life, has lost his High Court appeal against extradition to the US. Link to this video
10:05AM BST 31 Jul 2009
In a 41-page ruling, the judges said extradition was "a lawful and proportionate response to his offending". His mother, Janis Sharp, said outside court: "We are heartbroken. If the law says it's fair to destroy someone's life in this way then it's a bad law." Whether or not Mr McKinnon can appeal further will be decided at a later date. Lord Justice Burnton said it was a matter that should be dealt with "as expeditiously as possible", probably in September. Lawyers for Mr McKinnon, 43, who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, had challenged decisions by successive Home Secretaries which permitted the extradition to go ahead. Related Articles

Home Office is the real villain in McKinnon case
31 Jul 2009
Keir Starmer QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), refused to sanction a trial in this country which would effectively block the extradition. Mr McKinnon's legal team had also fought to overturn that decision. However, judges at the High Court in London refused to accept his challenge against extradition. Mr McKinnon, from Wood Green, north London, and his supporters fear his medical condition, coupled with the stress of extradition and tough American prison conditions, could result in psychosis and suicide. He is also convinced he will not get a fair trial in the United States. "There is no way I would get a jury of my peers in America," he said on BBC Radio 5 Live. "I would be tried in Virginia, and a lot of people in Virginia work for defence contractors. I'm accused of damaging defence computers." Mr McKinnon's mother had said she feared she might never see her son again. "If you are talking about a 60-year sentence, if he did 30 years I would never see him again because I'd be dead," she said. She said Asperger's sufferers "don't understand many social rules, they don't understand the consequences of their actions". Ms Sharp added: "Gary wouldn't be thinking of the consequences, he was thinking there's suppressed information here about UFO technology - he was obsessed with it." Mr McKinnon had been prepared to plead guilty to computer hacking offences to avoid extradition. But former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith decided last October to order his removal following a request from the US prosecuting authorities. The current Home Secretary Alan Johnson insisted he had no power to demand the trial take place in the UK. The US authorities claim Mr McKinnon was responsible for the "biggest military hack of all time", involving 97 government computers belonging to organisations including the US Navy and Nasa. Mr McKinnon has admitted breaking into the system in 2001-2 during a period of heightened security in the wake of the September 11 2001 attacks. But he claims he was looking for evidence of extraterrestrial life. The US government alleges his conduct was intentional and calculated to influence and affect it by "intimidation and coercion". It says the cost of repair totalled more than 700,000 US dollars (£436,000). The campaigners who sought to block his extradition said he acted through "naïvety" as a result of Asperger's – a form of autism which leads to obsessive behaviour – and should not be considered a criminal. At a recent hearing, Edward Fitzgerald QC accused the Government of reaching a "flawed" decision in the light of the uncontradicted medical evidence of the severe mental suffering that extradition would cause. The QC described Mr McKinnon as "an eccentric person who has passionate views about UFOs". Extradition was "unnecessary, avoidable and disproportionate" as Mr McKinnon could be prosecuted in the UK. Mr Starmer refused to order a UK trial, saying the bulk of the evidence was located in the US and Mr McKinnon's actions were directed against the US military infrastructure. He also argued there was a large number of witnesses in the US, along with the real evidence – apart from Mr McKinnon's computer. Gathering the evidence for prosecution in the UK would be an immense task, and certain material from the US might be considered "sensitive" by the US authorities. Previously Mr McKinnon's case against extradition has been rejected on other grounds by a district judge, the High Court and then, in July last year, the House of Lords. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg also refused to intervene. He was caught as he tried to download a grainy black and white photograph which he believed was an alien spacecraft from a Nasa computer housed in the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas. He was easily traced by the authorities because he used his own email address. He has always said he had no malicious intent but was looking for classified documents on UFOs which he believed the US authorities had suppressed. He has signed a statement accepting his hacking constituted an offence under the UK's Computer Misuse Act 1990. A large campaign involving family, politicians and celebrities fought a long battle against extradition. The case has also once more brought into focus the perceived inequality of laws which enable the US to extradite UK citizens with comparative ease, while it is much harder for the UK authorities to secure the removal of wanted American citizens to these shores.
