Can Lloyds shareholders bank on a dividend?
Antonio Horta-Osorio has bounced back from his lay-off caused by medical reasons and announced decent pre-tax profits of £288m at Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds Banking Group boss Antonio Horta-Osorio poses for the waiting media as he arrives back at their head office in the City of London in January, after taking a leave of absence from work Photo: PA	By Damian Reece

Comments
Given all the commotion surrounding the company recently, it's a decent set of results. Having accelerated write-offs previously, Horta-Osorio is keeping the pace up with asset sales to shrink its balance sheet.
Cost cutting and more conservative funding means Lloyds' voyage back to the land of the living continues - including ownership of the Halifax, the one treasure to be salvaged from its sea of troubles. But what's next? Customers are borrowing less, not more. Funding costs are rising. Growth, as a result, will be hard come by even if the bank regains financial stability. The answer has to be the reinstatement of a dividend - before the end of this year.
Roy Hodgson nets a great job
Celebrations in the world of business at the appointment of Roy Hodgson as the new England manager - it makes apparent boardroom excess look the paragon of restrained virtue.
True, the FA can't possibly waste so much money again on a manager as they did with Fabio Capello. But handing a 64 year-old a four-year contract is a generosity unknown in boardrooms, where leaders are on rolling one-year deals.
Will there be any performance-related element of Hodgson's pay? I doubt it, luckily for him. Clawback if we fail to win anything? Come on, this is the football business, not real business. It's a result for Hodgson with no risk attached. Nice work if you can get it.

Half of Britons will get cancer during their life by 2020
Half of all people in Britain will contract cancer at some point in their life by the 2020s but four in ten of them will survive, according to a new report by McMillan Cancer Support.
The number of people in Britain who develop cancer during their life has increased by more than a third in the past two decades By Nick Collins, Science Correspondent
6:00AM BST 07 Jun 2013

Increasing life expectancy is leading to a growth in cancer cases because more people survive to an old age, but medical advances mean that a smaller proportion of cases are deadly. The number of people in Britain who develop cancer during their life has increased by more than a third in the past two decades, and the number who get cancer but die from another cause has doubled over the same period. The figures suggest that the expanding number of cases and survivors will place a growing burden on the NHS and other cancer support services in the coming years, the charity said. Health data reveals that 32 per cent of people who died in 1992 had been diagnosed with cancer at some point in their life, but this rose to 44 per cent by 2010. Estimates published in the British Journal of Cancer suggest that by 2020, the figure could increase as high as 47 per cent. Related Articles

NHS 'must change' to help soaring number of cancer survivors
29 Mar 2013
The proportion of people who develop cancer but die from other causes has also increased, from 21 per cent in 1992 to 35 per cent in 2010. The number of survivors doubled during this period from 45,000 to 90,000. Further improvements in early diagnosis, care and treatment for the disease are expected to boost the proportion who survive to 38 per cent by 2020, according to the charity. Experts said the growing survival rate is "encouraging" but warned that many patients who beat cancer never return to full health and suffer sideeffects such as fatigue, pain and immobility due to the heavy toll of the disease and treatment. More services will be needed to help sufferers stay healthy at home and avoid the need for them to seek hospital treatment, the charity said. Ciarán Devane, Chief Executive of Macmillan, said: “This poses a Herculean challenge for the NHS and for society. “The NHS will not be able to cope with the huge increase in demand for cancer services without a fundamental shift towards proper aftercare, without more care delivered in the community, and without engaging cancer patients in their own health." Claire Knight, of Cancer Research UK, said: “These figures remind us that while our life expectancy is increasing, this also means more of us will be diagnosed with cancer. "The good news is that thanks to research, cancer survival rates have doubled over the last 40 years. But it’s crucial that we continue finding new ways to prevent, detect and treat cancer sooner, so that more people survive in future.”

NHS staff 'overworked' survey finds
One in three NHS staff say they are not enough people in their department to get their work done, according to the annual health service survey. One in three NHS staff say they are not enough people in their department to get their work done Photo: ALAMY	By Rebecca Smith, Medical Editor

And almost half of NHS staff said they do not have time to complete their tasks, it was warned. Staff cuts and a lack of cover when people are on leave or sick is to blame, a union said. The 2011 NHS Staff Survey, of more than 135,000 health service workers in England, found some were struggling with heavy workloads. Do you think NHS staff are overworked?
The official NHS staff survey comes after the Royal College of Nursing warned that one in three nurses working on older people's wards are too busy to help patients with eating or going to the lavatory. Related Articles
Nurses 'too busy' to help elderly patients with basic care
20 Mar 2012
Overall the NHS survey found that two thirds of staff were happy with the quality of care they provided to patients. However when hospital staff were asked if a friend or relative needed treatment in their organisation, they would be happy with the standards of care, the proportion answering 'yes' varied from just one in three at Croydon Health Services NHS Trust to 96 per cent at Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology NHS Foundation Trust. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: “This survey shows that NHS staff remain committed to providing the highest quality of care to their patients. “The number of staff happy with the standard of care remains stable, with some foundation trusts performing to a very high standard. “Too many trusts continue to have less favourable levels of recommendation to family and friends. “The NHS should use this as a basis for seeing improvement in the services we deliver for patients in the future.”
Christina McAnea, Unison head of health, said: “The staff survey reflects some of the pressures felt by staff, but our own survey painted a much bleaker picture. “Unison’s survey showed that 85% experienced an increase in workload and 83% suffered an increase in stress over the past year. “The increase in workload is not a coincidence, it is down to cuts in staffing and to a lack of cover for staff on sick or on leave. “And it is not just staff who suffer - the increase in workload and stress is felt by patients and by workers’ families.”
The NHS survey also found that a fifth of staff said they cannot do their job to a standard they are personally pleased with and half would not recommend their trust as a good place to work. Almost nine out of ten staff who deal with patients said they were satisfied with the quality of care they provided. Health News

How July 7 bombers slipped through the net The missed opportunities that allowed two of the July 7 bombers to slip through the fingers of the security services were highlighted by the trial of Mohammed Shakil, Sadeer Saleem and Waheed Ali. 1:32PM BST 28 Apr 2009
It was confirmed that ringleader Mohammed Siddique Khan and right-hand man Shezhad Tanweer were watched by the authorities meeting terrorist Omar Khyam on four occasions in early 2004.
They were twice tracked returning to Leeds, photographed at a service station and a McDonald's restaurant and filmed walking with Khyam down a street in south-east London.
Khyam, from Crawley, West Sussex was jailed for life in May 2007 for leading a plot to use fertiliser bombs on a shopping centre or nightclub following Britain's biggest ever terror trial at the Old Bailey.
It was during surveillance on him that MI5 officers came across Tanweer and Khan, who had attended a terror training camp with Khyam in Pakistan two years before 7/7.
But they were dismissed as "peripheral figures" and their activities never fully investigated.

Just 16 months later the terror cell led by Khan slaughtered 52 people on London's transport network.
The jury at Kingston Crown Court were given a detailed schedule logging the times and activities when Khan, Tanweer and defendant Waheed Ali travelled south to meet Khyam.
The court heard a Honda Civic containing the trio met Khyam and his brother in their Suzuki vehicle in Crawley.
The group chatted briefly before the two vehicles drove around for around an hour, stopping at a retail park, before the Honda headed back north.
Pictures of Khan, Tanweer and Ali were taken at Toddington service station on the M1 as the car was followed back to the Leeds area in the early hours of the morning, stopping at addresses linked to all three.
Khyam's vehicle and home had been secretly bugged and conversations he had with Khan and his group were recorded, transcripts of which were read to the court.
During the February 21 meeting, Khyam tells Khan during a discussion on fighting abroad that travelling to Pakistan was a "one way ticket".
He advised Khan on how to evade authorities, what kit would be needed and how to carry out scams in this country to raise funds.
He said: "You may as well rip the country apart economically as well", adding how "all the brothers are running scams" such as fraudulent bank loans and trade accounts.
On February 28 a surveillance team watched two cars arrive at a McDonald's just off the A23 in Tushmore near Crawley.
Surveillance photos showed Tanweer, Ali and Khan meeting Khyam and his brother in the car park.
The vehicles were later followed travelling to Slough, Berkshire, and Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, before the Honda was followed again back to West Yorkshire.
On March 23, Khyam was watched meeting the Leeds group for the fourth time.
Covert video footage captured them strolling past a kebab shop on their way to an Islamic bookshop in London's East End.
Despite their links to Khyam, neither Khan nor Tanweer were classified as priority targets by the Security Service.
Security and police sources have stressed that at the time they believed Khan and his associates were involved only in minor fraud.
In the wake of the bombings, the Government insisted there had been no warning of the attack.
The bombers were said to have been "clean skins" who had never made any significant impression on the intelligence radar before.
Once the operation to catch Khyam's terrorist cell had wound up, it was MI5's responsibility to assess the threat posed by those on the fringes and decide what level of resources to devote to investigating them.
But the service decided Khan and Tanweer were "peripheral" figures. They were listed among the dozens of "desirable" rather than core "essential" targets and, as a result, were able to slip the net.

Outrage over Air New Zealand cougar advert An advertisement for an airline that portrays single middle-aged women as "meat hungry cougars" who prowl bars in search of young men has provoked outrage. The term "Cougar" has been coined for sexually aggressive older women on the hunt for younger men By Bonnie Malkin 2:40PM GMT 18 Jan 2010
The risque Air New Zealand campaign, shows a so-called cougar "starving itself on sparse vegetation during the day then hunting large slabs of meat at night" by stalking a young man at a bar.
Despite the man's attempts to ward off the woman's advances, the cougar has "not tasted fresh meat for days" and drags her prey to an inner-city flat often forcing them to listen to "Enya or the Eurythmics".
According to a voiceover on the spoof documentary, the women, aged in their 30s, 40s and 50s, routinely prey on men in their 20s, many who "pretend to be gay" to avoid them.
The promotion encourages women aged over 35 to send in photographs of themselves out on the town with their "cougar mates".
The term "Cougar" has been coined for sexually aggressive older women on the hunt for younger men, with actress Courteney Cox recently starring in TV comedy "Cougar Town".
But rape prevention charities and women's rights groups have branded the online campaign offensive and sexist.
New Zealand's Rape Prevention Education said it was appalling, disgusting and degrading.
"We have also had complaints from male survivors who have been raped by women and they are very distressed that their situation is being laughed at and made out to be humorous," said director Kim McGregor.
A spokesman for Air New Zealand said the campaign was supposed to be "light-hearted" but some older women had "taken a bit of offence to it". New Zealand

Coming to a cinema very near you is the latest blockbuster, or World Cup football match. So near is it, in fact, that it is in your house. Invite friends and family over, lay on a bit of a spread, put your feet up; live like a film star. "It is a wonderful facility," says Mike Spenser-Morris, whose sumptuous mansion near Newmarket has a dedicated cinema with a spangled ceiling and magenta lighting. The house, called the Courtyard, also has almost everything else you could wish for – an Italianate façade, eight bedrooms, six bathrooms, six reception rooms, an indoor pool and plenty of "fun" rooms. It was built to suit all the desires of Mike and his wife Judy back in 2002 and so, as many are increasingly doing, they added a home cinema. The room contains a 50in plasma screen and a 112in cinema screen for big occasions. "It is completely dedicated to the screen, has no windows and has very high-spec equipment. Going to the cinema is enjoyable anyway but doing it at home is an even better experience because of the comfort and the closeness of the screen," Mike says. They have large four-seater sofas banked up in three tiers so that everyone is comfy and gets a good view. "The high-definition screen and sheer size of the screen means that it's like being at the big sporting events – the rugby, the tennis, the horse racing – when we are watching it."
There is a touch of Hollywood in the room, too, with the star-studded ceiling and a scantily clad mannequin bearing a little blackboard on which Mike writes "now showing…" The excitement and atmosphere of a night out at the movies is not lost in domesticity. Mike and Judy are selling to move to Bury St Edmunds, where they own part of the ruined abbey. Strutt & Parker (020 7629 7282) is selling at £3.95m. "Home cinemas first appeared about 10 or 12 years ago. Now they are more common and sometimes quite modest houses have them. They bring family and friends together," says Mark Jamieson of Strutt & Parker. "In the hierarchy of rich man's toys they still come after the pool and the tennis court, and there are buyers, with old money, who they may not appeal to."

That little bit of star dust is irresistible to some though. Adam and Helen Beckford moved into their self built three-bedroom house four years ago. It is in the Langdon Hills on a prize patch of Green Belt in Essex. "It was always my dream to have a home cinema," Adam says. "We couldn't build a big house because it is on Green Belt land but we could build outbuildings. So I put a cinema in an outbuilding with a bar and bifold doors along one side to the Jacuzzi, terrace, barbecue and pizza oven."
The cinema has two sofas and seats about 10 altogether. "We have the family over for films, I have the boys over for a bit of a party to watch the football and my wife and I watch horror movies together," Adam says. There is a 50in plasma screen and a 7ft cinema screen which drops down, a Mitsubishi projector and a Denon amplifier. "You don't have to spend a lot. The equipment costs around £2,000 or £5,000 for a really good set-up."
The couple are selling through John D Wood (01245 344222) for £750,000 because they now have a baby and want a bigger house. They will build again and this time he plans to dig out a basement for the home cinema because "it is used more than the lounge". Popcorn anyone? Convert your garage
The Garage Conversion Company has recently started making home cinemas. Convert a single garage for £8,500 to £10,000, or a double for £15,000 to £20,000 with sound insulation, lighting, electrics (not including swanky furniture or super comfy armchairs). It supplies three levels of home cinema package at £3,500, £6,500 and £10,000 on top. Contact www.nationalhomecinema.co.uk

800 feet tall deep sea waves discovered in Pacific Ocean
Waves more than 800 feet tall have been found to form and break underwater in parts of the deep ocean. Researchers found the waves form at the boundary between two layers of water with different densities in a deep ocean trench known as the Samoan Passage in the South Pacific Ocean Photo: WaveChasers APL	By Richard Gray, Science Correspondent

They would be the ultimate in big wave surfing. Scientists have discovered waves that rise up to be taller than some sky scrapers. However, rather than being found on sun kissed beaches in exotic locations around the world, these waves are three miles beneath the surface of the ocean. Researchers found the waves, which are also known as internal waves, form at the boundary between two layers of water with different densities in a deep ocean trench in the South Pacific Ocean. The waves rise up due to ridges on the ocean floor of a narrow channel to the north west of Samoa that forces cold, saltier water to rise up into the warmer water above. Related Articles

These form 800 foot waves that rear up and then plunge hundreds of feet down into the dense water on the other side of the sill. However, each wave takes around an hour to break. So while it might never be possible for surfers to ride these enormous waves, the scientists say these waves play an important role for mixing nutrients in the ocean. Professor Matthew Alford, an oceanographer at the University of Washington who led an expedition to the channel, known as the Samoan Passage, said: “Oceanographers used to talk about the so-called ‘dark mixing’ problem, where they knew that there should be a certain amount of turbulence in the deep ocean, and yet every time they made a measurement they observed a tenth of that. “We found there are loads and loads of turbulence in the Samoan Passage, and detailed measurements show it’s due to breaking waves.” The findings are published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The layers of water form because dense cold water in Antarctica sinks into the deep Pacific Ocean and is forced through a 25 mile gap north east of Samoa. Around six million cubic metres of water pass through the gap every second – around the same as 35 Amazon Rivers. Dr Alford and his team lowered specially designed "wave chaser" instruments three miles to the seabed and took measurements over thirty hour periods of the turbulence at the boundary between the cold dense water and warmer water above. They found that as the dense bottom layer of water flows over two consecutive ridges in the Samoan Passage, it causes them to form lee waves, like air rising over a mountain. These become unstable and break, causing the dense cold water to mix with the upper layers. Professor Alford said this helps to explain why dense cold water does not permanently pool at the bottom of the ocean. The waves may also play a role in stimulating global currents. They believe waves like this form at other locations in the Samoan Passage and elsewhere in the ocean. At their most powerful, some internal waves can sweep submarines off course or cause them to sruface. “In addition to the primary sill, other locations along the multiple interconnected channels through the Samoan Passage also have an effect on the mixing of the dense water. "In fact, quite different hydraulic responses and turbulence levels are observed at seafloor features separated laterally by a few kilometres, suggesting that abyssal mixing depends sensitively on bathymetric details on small scales. “Climate models are really sensitive not only to how much turbulence there is in the deep ocean, but to where it is. “The primary importance of understanding deep-ocean turbulence is to get the climate models right on long timescales,” Alford said. Professor Alford, who is a surfer himself, added that these deep sea waves would make for a dull surfing experience. He said: “It would be really boring. The waves can take an hour to break, and I think most surfers are not going to wait that long for one wave.” Science News

Middlesex paceman Steven Finn discovers fizz after slow start with four-wicket haul against Derbyshire at Lord’s

Two men who both made their first-class debuts in the same match for Middlesex as 16-year olds dominated the opening day’s play. For the home side, Steven Finn took four wickets for 36, warming to his task after tea, while for Derbyshire, Billy Godleman, a former team mate of Finn’s, made one of the slowest ever fifties at the ground. England director of cricket Andy Flower and national selector Geoff Miller were both there to see Finn and would have been pleased with his efforts after tea. Before that, he lacked rhythm and failed to find that probing fuller length pitches this time of year demand. He had the same problem in the recent Tests against New Zealand, troubling batsmen far less frequently than someone of his pace and height should. His first wicket on Wednesday required a good catch from Toby Roland-Jones, after Wes Durston played a controlled paddle hook down to fine leg. It looked a safe shot but Roland-Jones judged its flight well and moved in to catch it inches above the outfield. England’s fastest bowler discovered some fizz after tea. Then, with the sun on his back, he whipped out Dan Redfern, Chesney Hughes and Jonathan Clare in the space of 22 balls. Redfern was caught down the leg-side, a fortuitous dismissal for the bowler, but Hughes and Clare were undone by Finn’s pace, which should have been a handful for a team newly promoted to division one such as Derbyshire. Watching both men was a trying business at times: Finn because he bowled quick but was slow to find the penetration expected of a Test bowler, and Godleman because you could hardly detect a pulse in a knock that was barely ticking over.

Defensive innings as slow as this can play their part in Test and four-day matches, but rarely in the first innings of a match and hardly ever when the pitch is so benign or one of the boundaries is but 50 yards from the stumps. Actually, Godleman seemed to refuse to acknowledge the very existence of boundaries, scoring just one four, from a fine off-drive off Tim Murtagh in the opening 10 overs, in a half-century that came off 244 balls. On an April pitch, when edges abound, that takes some doing, suggesting that when he did make contact it was near the middle of the bat but not on the sweet spot. Such excessive caution is difficult to fathom though Godleman, who had a full-time contract with Middlesex at 17, is on his third club at the age of 24 after a brief stint at Essex. Perhaps being that peripatetic would probably render most batsmen strokeless. If his stoic defence did not go unappreciated by his colleagues, his running between the wickets did, after mix-ups with Wayne Madsen and Tony Palladino led to both men being run out, Palladino before he had even faced a ball. If there was any survivor’s guilt it only revealed itself after his second victim when, five balls later, he was lbw to Tim Murtagh for 55, his first error in almost six hours batting. Cricket

Celtic penalty hero Kris Commons pays tribute to younger brother Spencer after Champions League glory
Midfielder Kris Commons has dedicated the winning goal he scored for Celtic against Spartak Moscow on Wednesday to younger brother Spencer, whose promising footballing career was curtailed due to injury.

Commons’ successful penalty eight minutes from time took the Glasgow giants into the last 16 of the Champions League but, for the 29 year-old, it was a moment of glory to be shared with the sibling two years his junior. While he was waiting to go for a scan on the thigh injury inflicted by Spartak Moscow’s Kim Kallstrom (which earned the Swede a red card), Commons spoke to the media at Celtic’s Lennontown training complex, he reflected on the fact that Spencer, an electrician, had started work eight hours earlier. He may be living the dream but the former Stoke City, Nottingham Forest and Derby County man isn’t living it only for himself. “My family is pretty poor and I come from a relatively rough area,” said the Mansfield-born midfielder. “I was playing for average little teams when I was a young kid. “When Spencer sees me on television, he can’t believe he’s watching me in the Champions League! And when I’m scoring to get Celtic into the last 16, it just seems surreal for me because I feel like I don’t really belong there. Related Articles

“When you’re mid-table in the Championship, you just think you’re a decent player, like most players in the Championship. “Spencer is a sparky. He played football and was in the same Notts County side as Kelvin Wilson but he broke his ankle – and dislocated it at the same time – so that was him finished. “I owe him a lot. People used to say to me, ‘Your kid’s better than you’ so when I play now I feel that I am doing it for both of us. “He was only 16 when he [suffered the injury]. He was breaking into the first team at the time with Kelvin and the big man always said he was a top player, never pulled out of a tackle – and that was probably his downfall: he didn’t pull out of that one and got his ankle snapped. “That was him finished, done. He went from being a young kid breaking into the first team at Notts County to fixing light fittings. “He wasn’t at the game last night. He came up for the Barcelona game and travelled to Spain for the away leg but he was up at five in the morning working at the Co-op. “He doesn’t even play five-a-side now. He has very limited movement and it still causes him problems now. It was a nasty bit of work on his ankle.”
Scotland star Commons displayed nerves of steel to take the decisive spot-kick at Parkhead but confessed yesterday that he believed that qualification had already been achieved when he stepped up to convert the award. The significance of what he was about to do eluded him at the time, although there was a sense of relief yesterday that his shot, which struck the underside of the crossbar, had subsequently bounced on the right side of the line. “I had no idea that Barcelona were drawing,” he said. “We got the impression they were winning. All the crowd were cheering and we were looking around at each other thinking, ‘They must have scored’. “They were chanting Xavi or Messi or something so we thought they’d gone 1-0 up and might go on to get two or three and we would just have to hold out for a draw. “When I put the ball down I wasn’t thinking, ‘This is to take us into the last 16,’ I was thinking, ‘Just put your foot through it, you’ve done it a million times in training, straight down the middle, nice and high away from his feet, we’ll win 2-1 – and, hopefully, Barcelona will do us a favour.’
“I suppose it’s the sort of stuff you dream about as a boy. It’s one thing to do it on a park or in training and another thing to do it in a game when there is something at stake. That’s completely different but I just thought it was a normal penalty. “It was only when I was in the treatment room that someone said, ‘We’re through: Barcelona drew 0-0’. Oh my God! I’ll take my mobile phone out on the pitch next time!”
Former Forest team-mate Wilson, the most improved Celtic player this season, took time to find his feet at the club but he has emerged as an automatic first choice for mentor Neil Lennon. After missing the opening qualifying round against HJK Helsinki the 27 year-old has been an ever-present during the club’s European adventure. Having managed to prevent Lionel Messi from scoring at the Nou Camp, he would now love to be given the opportunity to similarly snuff out Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford when the draw for the round of 16 is made on Dec 20. “Now we’re [through] we’re not thinking that that’s our achievement,” he said. “We’ve beaten Barcelona, the best team in the world, to get there so we’re confident we can beat anyone here. “I would like to draw a Premier League team and Manchester United are their only group winners so that would be nice. “That’s not just because some people thought I was crazy coming here in the first place but because United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and I’ve never had the chance to play against them. “I don’t think anyone expected us to beat Barcelona or to beat Spartak home and away – but we did. We don’t go shouting it from the top of the rooftops but we’ve always been confident. We’ve quietly gone about our business and proved everyone wrong.”
Celtic’s success will, inevitably, lead to richer clubs being linked with moves for the likes of Gary Hooper, Victor Wanyama and, of course, Lennon himself. “Will people down south start to look at our manager now? Maybe so,” said Wilson. “Obviously, he’s done a great job here because we’re the first Scottish club to win 10 points in the Champions League so he’s doing something right. “I imagine there will be interest in our players as well but no one will want to leave – why would you want to leave now? “We’re in the last 16 and not many players get to compete in the Champions League, never mind reach this stage. We’re all cup-tied for the competition anyway so I don’t think anyone will go – I hope not, anyway.”
Hoops in the money Celtic have made nearly €30 million in guaranteed revenue from Uefa for their participation in the Champions League this season: Play-off participation €2.1m Group stage participation €5.3m Match fees €3.3m Projected market pool €11m Performance bonuses €3.5m Last 16 qualification bonus €3.5m Total to date €28.7m Celtic’s victory over Spartak Moscow – and qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League – has provided Scottish football its best coefficient points return since 2007/08. That was the last time Celtic reached the knockout stages of European football’s most lucrative competition. Celtic’s progress will not give the Scots another Champions League place but it does keep the status quo. Celtic

Buyers snap up first Apple iPad computers
The hype ended and Apple's latest gadget went on sale in America today as stores opened their doors to long queues of tech-savvy customers desperate to be among the first to own the new iPad. Link to this video
By Philip Sherwell and Tom Leonard in New York and Rebecca Lefort 2:29PM BST 03 Apr 2010
Comments
The touch-screen tablet computer went on sale in the US after months of increasingly frenzied build-up.
Apple began accepting pre-orders for the device on March 12 and there are thought to be at least 250,000 reservations for purchase, pick-up or delivery today.
Some buyers were so desperate to get their hands on the iPad and start testing its applications - or apps - that they waited in sleeping bags outside stores overnight.
At the shop in New York's Soho district Luis Martinez, a 30-year-old artist, was first in line after spending 12 hours on the pavement outside.
After a three-minute countdown by whooping staff he was ushered into the shop at the stroke of 9am.

"I've just got to get this product, man," he said. "I need it real bad. I can't wait to try out all the apps and functions."
Lines snaked around the building and private security guards were deployed to ensure that no one tried to jump the queue.
The buyers included visitors from Europe where the device is not yet on sale.
"The event, the people, the queues, the atmosphere - it's all incredibly exciting," said Pierre Leens, a 25-year-old Belgian.
A few minutes later, Mr Martinez left the store clutching his treasured new possession. "It feels like I'm a kid again and I just got the most perfect Christmas present," he said, smiling broadly.
In the background, Apple employees maintained a constant barrage of cheers and slapped hands with other customers leaving the store in a carefully orchestrated show of commercial hoopla. In New Jersey, Dan Roberts, 45, and his 15-year-old son Connor, arrived at the Bridgewater Commons store at 5.15am. He admitted his wife "thinks we're nuts".
Apple chief Steve Jobs has promised customers a "magical" device, selling for $499 to $829 (£330 to £545). Some analysts believe it will threaten the traditional laptop in the portable computer market but others have questioned the iPad's wider appeal.
On the one hand the company says the device, which will be available in Britain in late April, will revolutionise the way people browse the internet, read books and newspapers.
But critics point out it will not suit users need their computers for heavier duty chores. Nor, unlike the iPhone, does it make telephone calls or take pictures.
Its design, with a 9.7-inch touch-screen tablet, does however resemble an oversized iPhone and it runs on the same simplified operating system.
Although the device received a mixed reception when it was unveiled earlier this year, sales are now expected to exceed three million by the end of the year.
One of the key selling points has been the specially designed applications, or Apps, that will be available for the iPad.
Apple has also redesigned its iTunes Store to allow customers to purchase electronic books that can be read on the iPad.
Among the iPad applications are an offering from Netflix to stream movies and one from Walt Disney's ABC network that features television shows.
There are also games from developers such as Electronic Arts.
Many analysts expect the iPad to provide stiff competition for Nintendo's DS and Sony's PSP devices.
Early reviews from the few to have got their hands on an iPad have generally been extremely favourable.
The Wall Street Journal said it could "change portable computing profoundly" and "challenge the primacy of the laptop".
Stephen Fry, an Apple enthusiast, reviewed it for Time magazine, concluding that "for me, my iPad is like a gun lobbyist's rifle: the only way you will take it from me is to prise it from my cold, dead hands".
Apple have still to say precisely when the iPad goes on sale in Britain, and how much it will cost. Apple

Young travellers' spending soars
The world may have been mired in recession for five years but nobody appears to have told younger travellers who are keener than ever to get out there and explore.
Young travellers last year spent on average £2,500 on trips abroad – 40 per cent more than they did in 2007 Photo: ALAMY	By Adrian Bridge
11:58AM BST 20 Sep 2013
Comments
According to extensive research released today, young travellers last year (2012) spent on average £2,500 on trips abroad – 40 per cent more than they did in 2007. And in a further significant development, in addition to simply having a good time and “finding themselves”, more and more young travellers today are using their trips to gain useful work experiences, learn languages and to have deeper interactions with different cultures. “The truth is that when the going gets tough, the young keep on travelling,” said Laura Daly, of the World Youth Student and Educational Travel confederation (WYSE), the body responsible for compiling the research. “They are exploring further afield and travelling more frequently. They are also spending a lot more than they used to: rather than simply being seen as a leisure activity, travel is now increasingly viewed as a way of having experiences that help to enhance a CV - and to explore new cultures.”
More than 34,000 people from 137 countries were involved in the WYSE survey – New Horizons III – the results of which were presented at a conference in Sydney. It is by far the most extensive survey of its kind ever undertaken. The age of those questioned ranged from 18 to 35 and respondents were divided almost equally between travellers from the West and those from emerging countries such as China and Latin America.

Among the key findings were: Young travellers last year spent £138 billion - some 20 per cent of the total £692 billion spent on tourism worldwide. The increase in spending by young travellers of 9 per cent a year since 2007 is far more than the 3 per cent increase recorded by all age groups. The average duration of time spent abroad by young travellers has risen from 52 days in 2007 to 58 days in 2012. Young travellers on average made six short trips abroad and five longer ones (of more than seven days) in the past five years: an average of at least two a year. Younger travellers spend less on average on accommodation and more proportionally in destinations themselves. More and more younger travellers want to share their experinces with friends and families through social media such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
With such a huge sample of people questioned, the survey threw light on a number of differences in the way people travel from different parts of the world - and how they describe themselves. From the West, fewer young travellers fell into the traditional “backpacker” category, with a growing number seeking to engage in activities such as volunteering work and learning languages during longer periods abroad – seeing themselves more as “cultural” or “creative” travellers. There has been a marked increase in people well into their thirties who still see themselves as young travellers - many falling into the “flashpacker” category, people who are working, have more to spend (an average of £625 a week) and who travel with a number of digital appliances. Travellers from emerging countries had no problems being termed “tourists”, but many saw travel as a means of pursuing careers and actively sought work in the countries they visited. While travellers from the West have been heading to more distant locations such as China and Latin America – and within countries visited heading for more remote rural areas – the favoured destination for those from emerging countries is the United States. The survey did, however, show that some things don’t change. When it came to financing trips abroad, the “bank of mum and dad” is still crucial with some 44 per cent of trips being made by under 20-year-olds receiving parental financial support. When it comes to young travellers themselves, moreover, while fewer may these days say they are looking to “find themselves”, it’s not all about hard work and CV-enhancing activities, with “visiting cafes and restaurants” still being listed as one of the favoured activities while abroad. One thing that hasn’t changed is the fact that travel really can fuel the desire to travel more. “One of the main benefits young people get from travel is the thirst to discover even more,” said Ms Daly.

"I was in grade four and the schools had closed for the holidays, Mary (centre of photo) recalls. "I had just returned home from the river when I found a bunch of people at our homestead." She discovered there were plans for her to marry a stranger. Determined to avoid the marriage, Mary ran away, making her way through the villages and seeking refuge in a stranger’s home, who took her to the World Vision offices where she received support to help her continue her education. She now attends a boarding school that offers a safe haven for girls who have been rescued from early marriage.Picture: Lucy Murunga, World Vision
