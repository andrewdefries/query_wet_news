A garden is a lovesome thing
Dinah Hall 12:01AM GMT 30 Jan 2005

Dinah Hall selects children's books
Toddlers to 6
Those of us who grew up on Ladybird alphabet books – B for Baby (invariably throttling a P for Puppy) – might find the new generation of primers a little alarming. Alphabet Poem by Michael Rosen and Hervé Tullet (Milet, £10.99) resembles a Dadaist manifesto for toddlers, delivering "dogs drawing dad" and "kittens kick ketchup" against a delicious frenzy of illustrations that could have been committed by Kurt Schwitters on ecstasy. If your child grows up to be normal after this you should demand your money back. There's an ironic homage to Ladybird in the bold clarity of Find a Face by François and Jean Robert with Jane Gittings (Chronicle, £10.99), which sees faces in everything from the underside of a boot to a rusty old cheese-grater. Tempting though it is to give this to the youngest baby, you probably need to be at least three years old to make the connection between human features and a television aerial outlet. Now I may be reading too much in to this but I think I may have spotted the first lesbian dénouement in a children's picture book. The Princess and the Pea by Kerry Lee Spencer (Lothian, £8.99) clearly aims to debunk the whole princess myth. It takes the story beyond the Bird's Eye moment to post-marital disillusionment at which point the princess is whisked off by a pea-girl (oh, did I mention that the prince is a pea and the real princess a huge warty potato or possibly a giant jerusalem artichoke?) to a "nice market garden over the hill". This is either a work of insanity or genius but either way is perfect for 5- to 7-year-olds who torture Barbie dolls.

Sky Atlantic: will BSkyB's gamble pay off?
Sky's new channel is full of first-class programming. But will new subscribers be prepared to pay for it?

In one sense, Sky Atlantic is no gamble at all. Its roster of programmes, the lion's share made by the US cable network HBO, is impressive. These new shows include Boardwalk Empire, which recently won the Golden Globe for Best Television Drama, and the fifth series of Mad Men, itself a serial award-winner. Even the repeats will be unmissable: as part of its exclusive deal with HBO, Sky Atlantic has the rights to air old episodes of all HBO series - including all-time greats such as The Wire, The Sopranos and Six Feet Under - on a near constant loop. Its proposition to viewers is clear: if you want to watch the best and boldest US drama you will have to shell out for a Sky subscription and tune in to Sky Atlantic. Although it has not disclosed how much it has paid for all these glossy, gong-winning series, Sky is taking advantage of a clear gap in the market. Its competitors in the UK simply cannot match its spending power. The BBC can no longer justify spending large chunks of the licence fee on expense imports, regardless of their excellence. Channel 4 is suffering because of the advertising downturn. And ITV has never been that interested in high-end US drama series for the simple reason that, despite the rave reviews and ardent fans they attract, they never win millions of viewers. Even at the height of its powers on Channel 4, The Sopranos was watched by fewer people than repeats of Top Gear. So BSkyB's gamble is not whether Sky Atlantic will be any good. It will. But rather whether non-subscribers will be lured in by series such as Boardwalk Empire and sign on the dotted line. This worked for premium sport, especially football, and films. But this is where the argument for Sky Atlantic starts to wobble. Football and the latest Hollywood blockbusters are enjoyed by millions of people from all walks of life. Whereas the best US TV dramas are only watched by a relative minority. Even when The Wire, perhaps HBO's most critically lauded series, aired on BBC Two each episode was only watched by 600,000 viewers. Some fans of US drama will sign up for Sky to watch the best American drama first; but how many?
Sky Atlantic is great news for existing Sky subscribers. But for those who have so far declined to pay £20 a month for a Sky package (plus £80 for the box and set-up) there are two cheaper and potentially attractive alternatives if you're keen to watch Boardwalk Empire: wait for the DVD or watch it at a friend's house. - Sky Atlantic launches on Tuesday 1 February at 8.00pm Related Articles

Good time to have your assets in euros
The strength of the euro over the last year would give anyone with an account in the currency good reason to celebrate. By Alison Steed	ECB headquarters, Frankfurt, marks the launch of the euro in 2002 12:00AM BST 05 Jun 2008
Comments
The strength of the euro over the last year would have given anyone holding their assets in one of the world's newest currencies an uplift of nearly 15 per cent, according to Cater Allen Private Bank.
The euro was launched six years ago and has now been adopted by 15 countries with a combined population of 320 million people. Thanks to its strengthening position over the past year anyone paid in sterling or dollars would have seen a significant benefit from taking the risk of switching to a euro-denominated account.
Funds offer to mark start of tax year
Entrance fee cheaper than you might think The change in the purchasing power of the euro has been bad news for holidaymakers in the eurozone, but good news for those able to hold their accounts in euros, and the changes in rates have been rapid.
Although currency volatility means that there is significant risk in holding money in other currencies, many economic commentators believe that the euro is likely to strengthen further against sterling. This is due to market speculation that there are likely to be further interest rate cuts in the UK, while the European Central Bank (ECB) looks less likely to make cuts, due to inflation worries.
Sally Watts, marketing director at Cater Allen, said: "Our multi-currency accounts are suitable not just for those working abroad, but for those who want the flexibility of holding their account in a specific currency."
The currency benefit you would have seen in the last 12 months is a 14.9 per cent uplift against sterling by holding your account in euros, said Ms Watts, but you are able to switch between currencies in any of the currency accounts offered by the private banks. Cater Allen allows customers to hold currency accounts in euros, dollars or sterling - with a minimum balance of £5,000, €10,000 or $10,000. Having this facility means that you can switch between currencies at will to help make your money work harder.
But of course, there is more to currency products than just accounts. For example, some people will benefit from having a mortgage that is available in more than one currency too, as it can reduce the amount of interest that you have to pay overall.
With interest rates much lower in some areas of the world, such as Japan, some homeowners with properties in the UK have saved thousands of pounds in interest payments by switching to a home loan in dollars, euros or Japanese yen.
A multi-currency mortgage could save you money, but only if currency markets move in your favour. And this is a big 'if'. The reverse could also happen and such deals could end up costing significantly more than a standard fixed or discounted rate. These products can be complex, so make sure you understand exactly what you are doing before you sign on the dotted line.
Most companies offering this facility - including Savills Private Finance, HSBC Private Bank, Investec Bank, Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander, Citigroup and Ecu Mortgages - will lend only to those with mortgages of £250,000 plus.
The main advantage of having your mortgage lodged in a different currency is that if the exchange rate works in your favour, the amount you owe decreases. But rates can also be lower.
Take an example. If your mortgage is £100,000 and you wanted to convert it to dollars, which were - to make the maths easier - $1.80 to the pound, your debt would be $180,000.
If the dollar weakened to, say $2 to £1, you could convert the debt back into sterling and save £10,000, as the mortgage would now be £90,000. Appealing, but it could as easily work the other way.
Melanie Bien of Savills Private Finance, said: "If your home is worth £800,000 and you take out a £500,000 mortgage at an exchange rate of €1.50 to the pound, the loan will be worth €750,000. This would give you £300,000 worth of equity in your home. But if the euro strengthened to €1.40 to the pound your debt would be £535,700 - and your equity would shrink to £264,300."
If the equation works in your favour, you could save yourself thousands of pounds, which many people may think is worth the risk. Although it is not a strategy that should be undertaken by anyone who is stretching themselves to finance a property.
HSBC Private Bank is just one of the private banks that offers these mortgages. In some cases, clients will have assets and income in different currencies, and may 'hedge' their currency exposure across their entire financial position.
Andrew Morris, head of International Business at HSBC Private Bank (UK), said: "Other clients are seeking to reduce the capital value of their borrowing in sterling terms by switching between currencies which they hope will weaken against sterling and also to reduce the interest expense by switching between currencies that have lower borrowing costs - the risks of the opposite occurring are very real and so this strategy is only suitable for financially sophisticated and risk aware clients."
Since the bank will not offer specific advice on currency options, you should ensure you have a good adviser.
Mr Morris said: "Some of these clients, often those with personal or in-house family office expertise, make their own decisions but most appoint a professional currency manager who will make the decisions for them; we work closely with a small number of such managers.
"Typically the bank would initially lend a lower proportion of the value of the property to allow for the fluctuating value of the loan. There will always be a sterling equivalent of currency borrowing, at which the bank has the right to convert the loan to sterling to prevent the loan amount increasing beyond a predetermined proportion of the property value. This is agreed with the client at the outset."

Sports data firm Opta to be sold to Perform
Sports media business Perform is in advanced talks to buy Opta Sports Data, the London-based supplier of sports statistics to broadcasters and bookies.
Originally known as Sportingstatz, Opta was founded in 1996 by Toby Russell, collecting information such as which football players achieved the most passes in a given match or which parts of the pitch the most goals were scored from.

Opta's venture-capital backers, Albion Capital, are understood to have put the company up for sale for around £40m. A deal is expected within the next couple of months.
Originally known as Sportingstatz, Opta was founded in 1996 by Toby Russell, collecting information such as which football players achieved the most passes in a given match or which parts of the pitch the most goals were scored from. It counts BSkyB, American newspaper USA Today, and the National Basketball Association among its clients.
Opta turned over just over £10.8m in the 12 months to July 2012, the last full-year available, and had just tipped into the black with a pre-tax profit of £345,000.
Venture capital firm Close Ventures took a stake in the company in 2008, but shortly afterwards, Close in turn was acquired by Albion.

Sam Hamadeh, chief executive of PrivCo, a company that investigates privately held businesses, said Opta's days with Albion were numbered as soon as that deal was done. "Albion has been actively making new investments, but its job for the portfolio it inherited is to seek an exit at a fair price as quickly as possible," he told The Daily Telegraph. "That's standard for a venture-capital assuming a former venture-capital firm's legacy portfolio. The inherited start-ups are treated a bit like stepchildren. "Albion's task then was to quickly dress up Opta for sale, primarily by cutting expenses and forcing it to break even."
A deal with Perform would mark the latest in a string of deals for the listed media business. In 2011, the company acquired online football portal Goal.com, from a consortium including Bessemer Venture Partners. Last year it acquired Runningball, another sports data company, for €120m.
Mr Russell also operates news website Sports.com, and website and app design company, Coreware. He could not be reached for comment. Albion and Perform both declined to comment. Media

Britain at War Readers' Memories
Britain at War: 'Hey, sonny. Get me the hell out of this tree!'
My evacuation (with my cousin) to Butcome near Bristol was on my 6th birthday – September 4th 1939. It was a life changing experience. I was from a working class family in Wandsworth and found myself in Woodlands, the country residence of Mr and Mrs Lyne, which was fully staffed - with uniformed maids, a cook and a gardener.
5:42PM GMT 27 Nov 2008
When I left London with my new coat and toy telephone, my mother had told me I was going on holiday. I spent the duration of the war in my new home and I do not remember having an unhappy moment. Eventually all the staff were called up and we were left to fend for ourselves still living “below stairs”. Mrs Lyne was a keen theatregoer and she played an important part in the re-opening of the Bristol Old Vic after the war. We had many well known visitors to stay to escape from London for a while including Leslie Mitchell of British Movietone News, Fay Compton, Pamela Brown and Sir Compton Mackenzie. Sir Compton gave me a signed copy of one of the few children’s books he had written – “The Battle of the Dining Room Chairs”. When she was entertaining her illustrious guests, Mrs Lyne would often call for “the Evacuee” and I would be asked to recite a poem, usually Wordsworth to encouraging applause. I was considered a major part of her war effort and in her own way I believe she was fond of me. Woodlands was situated near a small aerodrome, now Bristol International Airport. One winter day, when I was 7 or 8, I was riding my bicycle along a country lane near the aerodrome wearing my thick coat and woolly balaclava. I heard a shout from the top of a tree in front of me, “hey sonny, get me the hell out of this tree!” A Canadian pilot had tried to land his damaged aircraft and had been forced to bail out, landing in the tree.

He had suffered frost bite and had shards of Perspex in his face. I remember being most affronted that he thought I was a boy rather than being concerned about his unfortunate predicament. The local farmer cut him down from that tree. I felt like a local hero. The Wills tobacco family lived locally. Lady Wills was a great friend of Mrs Lyne and she ran the Red Cross for the area. One year at the Summer Fete I was lucky enough to win a fabulous doll’s house in the raffle. I was absolutely thrilled as I had never had anything like that before. Much to my dismay, Mrs Lyne insisted that I give it back and allow it to be re-raffled to raise more money for the Red Cross. I still have the letter from Lady Wills, thanking me for my generosity. I like to think that she understood the feelings of a disappointed 7 year old girl! My mother stayed in London through the war and we wrote to each other regularly. I still have all of those letters, which is a wonderful record of the war through a child’s eyes. I returned to London in 1945 and stayed in touch with Mr and Mrs Lyne. Mr Lyne was made Lord Mayor of Bristol in 1951. I spent many a summer holiday in Butcombe and still visit now. Mrs Margaret J Rossiter Horsmonden Kent

We heard about the decoding and the German messages and how it must always remain a huge secret, even after the war.
Working the Radar system
A few evenings later we four strangers met at various buildings where high ranking RAF officers and others criticised. Remarks like “the skirt is too long, the hat is hideous, is the material hard-wearing?” were fired on all sides. My father hated killing our hens
Margaret and I used to go upstairs and put our pillows over our heads till the massacre was over. Advertisement

Pentecostals outnumber Methodists in UK
By Jonathan Petre, Religion Correspondent
12:01AM GMT 19 Dec 2006
Pentecostals now outnumber Methodists at church services in England, according to a survey. The century-old branch of Christianity is in third place behind the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church in terms of attendance for the first time. The research will alarm leaders of the 200-year-old Methodist Church, which will next year celebrate the tercentenary of the birth of Charles Wesley, a prolific hymn writer, and the brother of John, the founders of Methodism. Dr David Voas, a senior researcher at Manchester University's School of Social Sciences, said: "Methodism is dying in Britain. "By contrast, immigration from Africa and elsewhere has lead to growth in Pentecostal churches, where the worship style is more flamboyant."

Churches halt decline, new research shows
19 Dec 2010
Evidence for the shift comes from the English Church Census, conducted by the independent charity Christian Research, and substantially sponsored by the Economic and Social Research Council. According to the census, Sunday attendance at Methodist churches has fallen from 289,400 in 2005 to about 278,700 in 2006. The number of Pentecostals in church on an average Sunday has risen above 288,000. "Black churchgoers in inner London, where they outnumber white attendees, are an important source of growth in the context of the national decline in church attendance," said Dr Voas. "So it is significant that 40 per cent of Pentecostals, but only four per cent of Methodists, are black." The Methodist Church closed 264 churches between 1998 and 2005, more than any other denomination. During the same period, attendance declined by a quarter. By contrast, Pentecostal numbers grew by a third, and new churches have opened. Dr Voas said: "It seems inevitable that the Methodist Church will be reabsorbed into the Church of England. The Pentecostals have appeared out of nowhere in the last couple of decades, but it remains to be seen whether they can make significant inroads into the white population." The Rev Jonathan Kerry, the co-ordinating Secretary for Worship and Learning for the Methodist Church in Great Britain, said: "It's always good news to hear of growth amongst Christians, regardless of denomination — we are not in competition." He added: "Methodism was born out of revival movements in the 18th century. However, like many historic denominations, the Methodist Church now struggles to respond to new movements of God's spirit without feeling that it is betraying the past." • The Church of England drew the biggest congregations for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day services last year — 2.8 million worshippers — since the Millennium, according to figures released yesterday.

Gordon Brown: risk of British failure in Afghanistan is real
The British mission in Afghanistan could end in failure, Gordon Brown will warn in a speech following the death of seven soldiers in six days.

Comments
In an address intended to shore up public support for the operation, the Prime Minister will accept for the first time that international efforts to stabilise Afghanistan, which began eight years ago, may not succeed. Describing the Afghan mission as a “conflict of necessity not choice,” Mr Brown will insist despite growing doubts over the continued deployment of British troops, “we cannot, must not and will not walk away”. However, following the deaths of seven soldiers in six days, he will also raise the prospect of defeat. “We entered together eight years ago,” he will say. “We must persist together; in our different ways we must all contribute; in the end we will succeed or fail together.”
Mr Brown will make his personal appeal amid doubts about how long the public and politicians will support the deployment of British troops. An opinion poll yesterday indicated that the majority of British voters now believed that victory in Afghanistan was no longer possible. In a YouGov poll for Channel Four News, 57 per cent of respondents said the mission could not succeed, up from 36 per cent two years ago. Nearly three quarters wanted to see troops home within a year. Related Articles

05 Nov 2009
The controversy surrounding the conflict grew yesterday as: Nato commander gave warning that “the clock is running against us”. Gen Egon Ramms, who oversees the Nato mission in Afghanistan, said public opinion would not tolerate a military stalemate. Another British serviceman was killed in Afghanistan on Thursday, two days after five soldiers were shot dead by an Afghan police officer they were training. The British death toll is now 230. The wife of Staff Sgt Olaf Schmid, a bomb disposal expert killed at the weekend, paid tribute to her husband as his body was flown home. Christina Schmid praised him as a “protector, not a destroyer” of lives. Families of servicemen killed in Afghanistan called for troops to be withdrawn, warning that the conflict was turning into “our Vietnam”. The Daily Telegraph has learnt that there is growing frustration in Whitehall at Barack Obama’s deliberations over sending another 40,000 soldiers to Afghanistan. His military advisers said in September that a troop surge was necessary but he had yet to make an announcement. British sources said the President’s indecision was undermining the mission. Adding to concerns about Western efforts to secure Afghanistan, the United Nations announced yesterday that it was pulling 600 staff out of the country temporarily because their safety could not be guaranteed. Eight years after the fall of the Taliban regime in Kabul, Afghanistan remains desperately poor and beset by drug trafficking and insurgency. President Hamid Karzai was returned to power this week after an election process widely seen as corrupt. Mr Brown will still insist on Friday that the presence of 9,000 British troops in Afghanistan remains essential for defending Britain from terrorists. He will say that despite the Western mission and Pakistan’s operations against the Taliban, al-Qaeda continues to plot attacks from the region. Despite growing doubts about the quality and reliability of the Afghan security forces being trained by Nato, Mr Brown will insist that “mentoring” must continue. Only when Afghan forces can secure the country themselves will Nato be able to withdraw, he will say. Despite his acknowledgement that the conflict may end in failure, Mr Brown’s aides insisted that he still believed the campaign was “winnable”. On Thursday night, Downing Street tacitly accepted that efforts to “sell” the mission to voters must be stepped up. “The Prime Minister has always wanted to show leadership on Afghanistan,” said a spokesman for Mr Brown. “There is always more that can be done.”
Baroness Royall, the Leader of the Lords, was more blunt in her assessment, admitting that the Government is not convincing voters of the need to keep troops in Afghanistan. “Support for the conflict is being lost,” she said in a recent debate. “We have to use all the tools at our disposal to try to ensure better understanding and more support for our troops.”
Douglas Henderson, a former defence minister, said the public must be shown a convincing strategy. “There is a feeling we are in a kind of stalemate,” he said. “People have supported what has been done in Afghanistan but they are wanting an explanation of where we go next.”
British commanders were also concerned that recent casualties could sway opinion. Lt Gen Sir Nick Parker, who will take over shortly as Britain’s senior commander in Afghanistan, said: “I hope we don’t make strategic decisions on the basis of this low-level, terrible action. If you start extracting conclusions from something at that level it could be very damaging.”

The fate of the Falklands is in the islanders' hands
With the world watching, the people of the tiny British Overseas Territory go to the polls to make history By Neil Tweedie
8:01PM GMT 08 Mar 2013
Comments
Lunchtime in Port Stanley, and the road-sweeping truck is proceeding slowly down Ross Road, the main thoroughfare of the Falkland Islands. There is no litter for it to suck up, none at all in this neat corner of suburban Britain transplanted to the far side of the world, but the driver sticks to his task assiduously, until the sweeper disappears round the bend taking it towards Government House and the old Royal Marine barracks at Moody Brook. There is a lot of traffic for the time of day. No fewer than four four-wheel drives pass within a few minutes. When they have gone, the silence returns, broken only by the lapping of water and the faintest breath of wind. The Falklands oscillate between complete backwater and centre of international attention. The parish-pump politics of this craggy imperial remnant can transmute overnight into the subject of fraught debate at the United Nations. So it has been with the two-day referendum that will take place on Sunday and Monday, during which some 1,700 eligible voters will be asked to answer yes or no to the question: “Do you wish the Falklands Islands to retain their current political status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom?”
The result is a foregone conclusion, but there will be plenty of people in Argentina and elsewhere looking for the slightest crack in the islanders’ loyalty to the mother country. Lots of journalists are paying attention, too. In addition to the British media contingent, some 50 are expected to fly in from Chile on Saturday, including television crews from Japan, Russia and Latin America. With them will be a contingent of electoral observers from Mexico, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay who have agreed to join a Canadian-organised monitoring process. Related Articles

Settling the issue
25 Feb 2013
Juan Manuel Henao, the American deputy head of the Referendum International Observation Mission, says: “It is a conscious decision to secure observers from the (Latin American) countries. The Falkland Islands are a Latin American issue and it is important for these observers to vouch for the process and draw their conclusion about what has gone on here.”
The Falkland Islands Government sees the observers as essential in ensuring the legitimacy of a process that began with a conversation between two members of the islands’ elected assembly during a cigarette break, and which has now become an international issue, affecting relations between Britain and America, and arousing the wrath of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Argentina’s combustible president. “A colleague, Gavin Shaw, and I were having a chat,” explains Dick Sawle, one of the assembly members behind the referendum. “It was a couple of years ago and we raised it with colleagues, and I suppose we weren’t that convinced. Then, when the Argentine pressure on the Falklands increased under Kirchner, we revisited the idea. And the more we thought about it, the more we thought it was a good idea.”
But why vote on a question that few, if any, islanders are going to answer in the negative? “It gets us out of the old bipartite 'possession’ debate between Argentina and Britain,” says John Fowler, a journalist on the islands’ newspaper, Penguin News. “Who owns the Falklands? Well, we, the Falkland Islanders, own the Falklands, actually. We have a historical and mutually loyal relationship with Britain, but we are not part of the United Kingdom.” Those behind the vote, costing £75,000, believe it will undercut Argentina’s stated position, that the islands’ inhabitants enjoy no separate political identity. As a “non-indigenous” people, so the line from Buenos Aires goes, the islanders, known as Kelpers, have no right to decide their fate. This conveniently ignores the fact that many of those voting can trace their presence in this part of the world back to the 1830s and 1840s, when the ancestors of a good part of Argentina’s population were sitting at home in Spain, Italy, Syria and elsewhere. David Cameron has backed the referendum enthusiastically, but he has failed to gain support for the exercise from the United States. John Kerry, the US Secretary of State, sat firmly on the fence during his inaugural visit to London, restating Washington’s policy that, while it recognises de facto British control of the islands, it takes no position on sovereignty. The referendum is an embarrassment for the Americans, who are happy to sound the trumpet of self-determination when it suits them, but prefer not to let it impede relations with South America’s second-most important country. The vote is pushed strongly in the Falklands for fear of a poor turnout that could send the wrong signal to the world. One poster has Mr Sawle pointing his finger, Kitchener-like (not to be confused with Kirchner-like) towards passers-by, while announcing “Your Country Wants You To Vote Yes”. The Yes-vote campaign is in full swing, despite the marked absence of a No counterpart. “Grass roots” events are planned for the next few days, including the spelling out of a giant “Yes” by four-wheel drives on the Camber, a stretch of land opposite Stanley on the far side of the harbour. Historically, the site has been used by the Royal Navy and other ships’ crews to commemorate their vessels with names spelt out in giant lettering. A briefing in Penguin News tells islanders to put on a good show for the media. “When you pass journalists, open your window, smile, wave or give the thumbs-up,” it implores. “Face-painting, especially with children, is encouraged. Please bring your flags.”
Since the war in 1982, one that saw a British force eject 11,000 Argentinian invaders, the islanders have become good at PR. They have also become wealthy on the back of licences issued to foreign companies wanting to exploit the rich fisheries around the islands. The quasi-feudal system that existed prior to 1982, in which a few absentee landowners controlled the economy, has given way to a vibrant, modern economy. And now there is oil, possibly on the scale of the North Sea. Investment is pouring in, despite Kirchner’s megaphone diplomacy, warning of sanctions against those who do business with the islands. Independence is now being talked about openly, but as a distant goal dependent on the removal of the Argentinian threat. Until then, the British and the military protection they provide are needed. Says Mr Fowler: “Maybe we have been goaded into a referendum a little bit by people who justifiably say, 'Look, in the present situation, you have the best of both worlds. You are supported by Britain militarily, but you are not paying British taxes and you are actually better off than Britain. Come on, grow up a bit.’ ”
Some islanders are wary about rocking the boat with a vote, despite support from Downing Street. “There are people here, particularly from the older generation, who feel even talking about independence shows disloyalty to Britain,” says Mr Fowler. But the signs of a more distant relationship are there to see. When arriving at Mount Pleasant Airport, the base built at enormous cost to defend the islands, British visitors must submit landing cards and customs forms. Those voting in the referendum must have been accepted for permanent residency after spending seven years here. There are two flags, too, the Union flag and the Falkland Islands Ensign, which flies outside government buildings. On Sunday morning, one of the Islander aircraft of the Falkland Islands Government Air Service will take a ballot box to the remote communities around West Falkland, while mobile voting stations fan out across East Falkland. The thing about this event, though, is that it will settle precisely nothing. Self-determination is an implicit right of British Overseas Territory status, so a Yes or No vote to Britannia’s rule will still leave open the possibility of an independent Falklands. Argentina, meanwhile, is unlikely ever to drop its claim to an archipelago that occupies a strange but central place in its national myth. The interest on Monday night will be in that rare species, a No-voter. “There will always be a few people to vote no, for all sorts of reasons, really,” says Mr Sawle. “I suppose there is a small number of people who think by voting No, they are voting for independence.”
Mr Fowler is more concerned by apathy than a significant No vote. “What worries me is if people don’t come out to vote,” he says. “There is a bit of resistance here to the notion that people are being pressured to vote.”
Leif Pollard, a fifth-generation islander, sees the referendum as an essentially simple exercise. “It will educate the rest of the world as to the way we feel,” she says, “that we want to remain a British Overseas Territory and not a colony of Argentina.”
Mr Fowler hopes for something more, the beginnings of nationhood. “We are one hundred per cent certain about one thing, and that is that we do not want to be Argentine. But you don’t want to define yourself by a negative. This referendum has done two good things: it has politicised a generation which was not politicised, and allowed us to begin the debate about who we want to be.”

Chelsea weigh up moves for Avram Grant and Rafael Benitez
Chelsea are considering turning to either Avram Grant or Rafael Benítez as their temporary manager should Roman Abramovich decide to sack Roberto Di Matteo. Uncertain future: Roberto Di Matteo could soon find his days are numbered at Chelsea Photo: ACTION IMAGES	By Jason Burt and Paul Kelso, in Turin
12:22AM GMT 21 Nov 2012
Comments
Pep Guardiola remains Abramovich’s first-choice to take over from Di Matteo who on Tuesday night said he took “full responsibility” for a 3-0 defeat to Juventus in Turin that threw his future into further doubt and the club in danger of becoming the first Champions League holders to fall at the group stage. If Guardiola insists he wants to stick to his plan of taking a season’s sabbatical from football — and not return to management before next summer — Abramovich will look for a short-term replacement. Benítez refused to accept a similar scenario when Andre Villas-Boas was sacked in March — insisting he wanted to be made a permanent manager on at least an 18-month contract. He may be able to persuade Abramovich to agree to that deal now, especially if Guardiola rules out any move to Chelsea, and it is understood there has been direct contact between the pair. Grant is readily available and despite being sacked by Chelsea in 2008, when he took the club to the Champions League final, having amazingly succeeded Jose Mourinho, it is believed he would be keen to return. Either appointment would not be welcomed by Chelsea supporters — who will be stunned that Grant is in the frame - unless they were in the short-term with Guardiola then taking over at the end of the season. Abramovich has a high-regard for Benítez although he is not popular with Chelsea fans. Di Matteo, despite winning the Champions League, has never convinced Abramovich he is the right man. The club’s defence of the trophy won is now out of their hands, with Juventus needing only a point in the final group match at Shakhtar Donetsk to join the Ukrainians in the last 16. Chelsea will face FC Nordsjaelland at home needing to win and hope. Related Articles

20 Nov 2012
Abramovich is understood to have discussed Di Matteo’s position with his advisors following the league defeat at West Bromwich Albion, and this result will only increase tension around the manager’s future. They face league leaders Manchester City on Sunday at Stamford Bridge, with more hawkish observers wondering if Di Matteo will still be in charge. A third defeat in eight days could make his position even more precarious, with Abramovic likely to intensify his pursuit of Pep Guardiola. A decision on Di Matteo’s future comes at a crucial time in the season, with the Club World Cup in Japan coming three days after the final Champions League game. Di Matteo accepted responsibility for the defeat, which came after the manager omitted Fernando Torres from the starting XI for the first time this season, and said he would continue to work for the team. Asked if he thought he would be in charge for the final group game in a fortnight he said: “At the moment, I think, with the team we are all in it together. I’m responsible for the results. At the moment I am here and I think I will be for the future,” he said. “It’s probably not a question you should ask me but, as far as I’m concerned, I’ll keep working. “I’m responsible for the result. I’m responsible for the performance. It’s a negative evening for us. If anyone has to take the blame, it’s me. I selected a team I was convinced was the right team to win against Juventus, or get at least a draw, so the blame belongs to me.” Di Matteo’s selection saw Eden Hazard was pushed forward to lead the attack in Torres’s place, with Cesar Azpilicueta deployed on the right side of midfield to provide cover for Branislav Ivanovic. The selection failed to make Chelsea appreciably harder to break down, though Hazard, Oscar and Juan Mata did offer occasional threat on the break. The omission of Torres was a risk given Abramovich’s fondness for his £50million indulgence. Di Matteo defended the omission, saying: “I was convinced it was the right selection which is why I decided that. I thought we did create some problems for them. But my conviction was 100 per cent to go with this team.”

Rome turns attentions to 2020 Olympic Games bid after giving up on plans to host Formula One Grand Prix
Rome has officially given up on plans to host a Formula One Grand Prix and switched its attentions instead to hosting the Olympic Games in 2020. One and only: Italy already host one grand prix at Monza and have decided to give up on plans to stage one in Rome Photo: PA	By Tom Cary
3:37PM GMT 21 Jan 2011
Follow The Italian capital had long harboured hopes of staging a street race but with Monza already in possession of a long-term contract and F1 power-broker Bernie Ecclestone adamant the country could only have one race, Rome mayor Gianni Alemanno has reluctantly conceded defeat. "We formally and definitely give up on the hypothesis of a Formula One Grand Prix in Rome," Alemanno said. "This move represents a step backwards because we have always said we would have done so, should the FIA have posed an alternative between Rome and Monza. "However, we have an Olympic dream that is still going on: so let's make clear to Italy and to the world that we want to stage the games in Rome.” The proposal to stage a race in Rome had never been entirely popular, even within Italy.

Local residents were sceptical while Ferrari, which hails from Monza in the north of the country, agreed with Ecclestone that Italy could only host one race per year given the worldwide expansion of the calendar to 20 races from 2011. Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said last week that he would prefer to see a new race in the United States over a second grand prix in Italy. Spain currently holds the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona and the European Grand Prix in Valencia but the latter is set to rotate to other nations in the future as F1 expands to new markets, with India a newcomer to the series this year. Maurizio Flammini, who dreamt up the Rome grand prix idea, argued the case for rotating with Monza but officials at the northern track - one of the so-called classics on the calendar - balked at the idea. To soften the blow, however, Roberto Formigoni, president of the Lombardy region where Monza is situated, said he would gladly back Rome's 2020 summer Olympic bid despite the strong rivalry between Italy's north and south. "We are and will be side by side with Rome because the Olympic bid can be successful and a victory for Rome can be a victory for all of Italy," he said.

Paralympics 2012: golden girl Ellie Simmonds grants PM an audience
Another day, another world record, another gold medal. The irrepressible Ellie Simmonds powered her way to her second victory of London 2012 with a blistering final leg in the 200-metre individual medley on another unforgettable night in the Aquatics Centre.

10:00PM BST 03 Sep 2012
Follow The 17 year-old knocked more than a second off the world record she had set in qualifying earlier in the day as she beat her nearest rival by almost nine seconds, before being presented with her medal by David Cameron.
She pronounced herself “really chuffed” with her victory and cheekily suggested that, having already met the Prime Minister in Downing Street, it was time to “schedule a meeting at my place”.
It was her fourth Paralympic gold medal, and few would bet against her adding to that tally when she swims in the 50m freestyle today, the third of her four events.
ParalympicsGB’s swimmers added four more medals to the total yesterday, including a silver for Sascha Kindred in the men’s SM6 200m medley and a bronze for Susannah Rodgers, 29, in the S7 100m freestyle event.
Natalie Jones, 27, who swam in an adjacent lane to Simmonds in the SM6 medley, took bronze after missing out on silver by one-hundredth of a second.

Once again Simmonds drew a deafening roar from the crowd from the start to the finish of her race, in which she trailed her nearest rival, Germany’s Verena Schott, until the final length, when she hit the accelerator with her favourite stroke, the crawl and was quickly out of sight. She said: “It’s great to be on form for the biggest race of my life. I was nervous but it’s always good to be nervous and get my adrenalin going.
“I’m so happy to have taken another second off my personal best in front of a home crowd. I’m just really chuffed.
“David Cameron congratulated me and being on the podium was an amazing atmosphere. I’ve met him before at No 10 so we will schedule a meeting at my place now!”
Kindred, 34, who has cerebral palsy, had been the fastest in qualifying for his final and won gold in the same event at the past three Paralympics.
But even a personal best time in the final was not enough to beat China’s Xu Qing, who surpassed Kindred’s world and Paralympic records in taking gold.
Kindred’s silver medal matched that won by his wife Nyree Kindred in the pool last week. He said: “I did my personal best on the biggest stage of my life.
“I can’t argue with that, or do better than that really. It took Xu Qing a massive world record to beat me, so hats off to him.”
More than 100 Paralympic records have been broken in the London 2012 aquatics centre after just five days of competition.

Greatest Rugby World Cup XV: second row middle jumper profiles - John Eales
They say nobody’s perfect, but John Eales wasn’t far off. His Australian team-mates were so convinced of this that they gave him the nickname ‘Nobody’. Eales had pretty much every skill the modern-day rugby player requires and was a born winner.

A sporting legend in Australia – and they have a few to choose from – Eales was mobile, had fantastic handling ability and work rate and he even kicked goals, hence his enormous 173 international points. Enter your greatest Rugby World Cup XV here to be in with a chance of winning tickets to the 2011 final in Auckland.
He was a leader of men also, able to delegate and tactically aware. It comes as no surprise that the Wallabies' best era coincided with the Eales years. The Brisbane-born lock made his international debut in 1991 in a 63-3 thrashing of Wales, before heading off to England for the 1991 World Cup. He had a stunning tournament, particularly at such a tender age of 21, playing a pivotal role in Nick Farr-Jones’s Wallaby side that edged out England 12-9 in the final. Related Articles

Eales joined Farr-Jones as a World Cup-winning captain in 1991, when his Wallabies side lifted the Webb Ellis trophy to cap a superb tournament of defensive brilliance and clinical play. He retired in 2001 as the most capped lock in history, although that record has been surpassed since by a number of players. Eales was one of those people who had sporting talent that just wasn’t fair – playing cricket for his school alongside Australian legend Matthew Hayden.

New 4G network 'patchy' coverage in tests
Less than half the users of a new 4G network could access it when tested in Manchester city centre, a new survey has found.

Comments
Data collected by mobile coverage firm RootMetrics for the BBC shows just 40.2% of test locations had access to the 4G network EE, which claims to offer "superfast" download speeds. EE claims that speeds of up to 40 Mbits/s are possible, with average download speeds of between eight and 10 megabits a second (Mbps). Outside the city centre there was no 4G coverage at all, according to the tests. In locations where 4G could be accessed, speeds exceeded the stated average, at around 17Mbps, according to the survey. Indoor coverage was also better than expected. Related Articles

11 Sep 2012
However, when factoring in test locations where 4G was unavailable, EE averaged download speeds of 7.6Mbps, slightly less than EE's claims. In practical terms, this would mean downloading a song would take 15-25 seconds compared with a minute on a 3G network such as Vodafone or Orange. In previous tests, 46% of all the tests for other mobile operators performed at speeds lower than 1.5 Mbps, compared with just 19% of EE's tests, according to RootMetrics. Everything Everywhere has been given permission by Ofcom to reuse its existing mobile phone spectrum for new, faster 4G networks. Rival networks, who will have to wait until next year to launch their 4G networks, following a spectrum auction, have been outraged by the advantage given to Everything Everywhere and threatened to challenge Ofcom's decision in court. Improving mobile broadband was a key plank of former Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s bid to ensure Britain had “the best broadband network in Europe by 2015” and Maria Miller, his successor, has unveiled a new consultation to ease planning rules so that both mobile and fixed broadband infrastructure can be installed faster.

Frustrated with rising energy bills? Take a leaf out of this granny's book as she releases her anger with a session of video game Grand Theft Auto 5 12:03PM GMT 30 Oct 2013
Comments
The gaming pensioner goes on a GTA video game killing spree in response to a letter she received from British Gas, saying they were increasing her bill by 20 per cent. GamerGran87, as she is known on YouTube, posted the video entitled British Gas Rampage which has been viewed more than 300,000 times. Under the video she posts, "sorry about the language everyone but I got a letter from British Gas and I had to let my anger out!"
"Twenty per cent price hike?! You thieving b------s."
