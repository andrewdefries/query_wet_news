Sandie Shaw: 'My husband thought he’d killed me'
Talking on Neil McCormick's Needle Time, Sandie Shaw reveals the real reason behind her decision to retire. 12:01PM BST 28 May 2013
Comments
Sandie Shaw has revealed that the real reason behind her decision to retire was a life threatening car crash in France earlier this year. The 66-year-old singer and therapist was in a 4x4 driven by her third husband, Dr Tony Bedford, when “from nowhere, a car came on the other side of the road, and the next thing I knew, the car was rolling, and my seat belt had come undone, so I was rolling around in this 4x4, it was almost like free fall. My husband thought he’d killed me.” Shaw was badly cut and had to be taken to hospital. “The whole of my face had opened up, all the top of my head, and I was just covered in blood. And I couldn’t breathe for this blood. I’ve never felt such pain in my life. I remember thinking ‘I’m so glad I never had the face lift, if this is anything like how it feels!’ That did go through my head.”
Shaw now wears her hair with a fringe across her forehead, to cover an unsightly scar. “This guy managed to sow me back together. I was not able to do anything for such a long time because I was purple, blue, and this huge scar on my face.” She has considered a skin graft but decided against it because the scar represents a pivotal moment in her life. “I just took a break and I thought I’m not happy with what I’m doing, I want to change it. I decided my life needed to move on a bit, and everything that has happened since then has kind of reaffirmed that.”

Shaw first announced her retirement in an interview with The Daily Telegraph in April, in which she said she wanted it to be “a really nice goodbye”. Talking to the Telegraph’s pop critic, Neil McCormick, she claimed that, having completed a tour in 2011 with Jools Holland, she felt it was a great place to finish. “I looked up into the starry sky and said, 'That’s it. I’m pleased with what I did. That’s a great finishing point.’ And that was that.” However, in a further interview with Neil McCormick for Needle Time on Vintage TV, Shaw reveals that it was the car accident that finally made up her mind. She also admits that she hadn’t intended to make her retirement public. Sandie Shaw chats to Neil McCormick (Roger Goodgroves)
She has been overseeing the re-release of her entire back catalogue, and a new best of compilation Long Live Love, on Salvo records. “We put this album out as a way of saying good bye. I was going to do it really quietly.” However, during her Telegraph interview, “it just popped out, what I’d been thinking or planning, I couldn’t hold it in anymore.”
Neil McCormick’s interview with Sandie Shaw will be broadcast on Vintage TV, Tuesday May 28, at 10pm. Follow Telegraph Music on Twitter

Privates on Parade was the making of me
The death of rep makes it more difficult for actors to learn their craft, but talent will out Dramatic pause: many of our greatest actors learnt their craft in repertory theatre Photo: Rex Features	By Michael Simkins
7:35PM GMT 15 Nov 2012
Comments
Sir Ian McKellen’s lament about the demise of repertory theatre, and his stark warning about how today’s fragmented, celebrity-obsessed industry is in danger of failing the next generation of leading actors on whom theatre tradition relies, may have caused bemusement among the younger generation of aspiring stars. If so, I suspect it’s only because many of them won’t have a clue what repertory is.
When I left Rada in the mid-Seventies there were still 70 or 80 regional reps you could apply to for a thorough training in stagecraft: Derby, Lancaster, Farnham – their names read like some theatrical Bradshaw. Back then you were assured of at least half a dozen sequential productions if you landed the job, with parts ranging from juvenile leads to the back end of a pantomime cow. Time to learn, to observe, to find your feet and, crucially, to sort your emotions and your technique out before things got serious in the West End or on TV.
My second job at the Theatre Royal York in 1979 perfectly reflected the extraordinary and nourishing training ground that only repertory could provide. My 12-month contract started with a production of Pinero’s classic farce The Magistrate, followed by Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew, on through Alan Ayckbourn’s Bedroom Farce, and then to Trevor Griffiths’s savage indictment of culture in Seventies Britain, Comedians, about a group of aspiring stand-ups attending evening classes in deepest Manchester.
In the role of Eddie Waters, the club comic who is their weekly instructor, the director cast the popular local stand-up Stan Richards (later to achieve immortality as Seth Armstrong in Emmerdale Farm). During rehearsals the entire cast even went over to Bradford Working Men’s Club to see Stan perform his shtick in front of a packed Sunday night crowd. (“My dog has no legs – I call it Marlboro ’cos every night I take it out for a drag.”) It was exotic, wonderful stuff.
But even after that the season was barely half-way through. I played a one-line reporter in Ben Travers’s Thark, then Tony Lumpkin in She Stoops To Conquer, then the lead in a new play written about the recently discovered Viking remains in the centre of the city, before high-kicking my way through Peter Nichols’s musical Privates on Parade, about a group of soldiers touring with the Combined Services Entertainment Unit in darkest Malaya.

The season finished – as all good rep seasons have to – with pantomime; in my case, Dick Whittington and His Cat, starring (in his first leading role) a young Gary Oldman as Cat. Unable to return home for Christmas due to heavy snow, I ended up squeezing into a single bed with him at a house in Rotherham owned by the parents of the actor playing the Sultan of Morocco.
Some of my casting, was, perforce, preposterous (my 60-year-old police sergeant, in particular, springs to mind). But the experience it offered was priceless. I learnt how to time a laugh, to hold a pause, and to know the difference between an audience of 80 at a Thursday matinee and a full house on a Saturday night. Most importantly, I experienced a crash course in nearly 400 years of British drama.
It also gave me the chance to act with, and learn from, leading actors who themselves had been schooled in this peerless tradition. Their names now seem as yellowing and forgotten as their photographs, invariably hanging in tatty frames in the parlours of the legions of theatrical landladies who looked after them (many of whom became surrogate mothers, nursemaids, and even lovers). Watching these theatrical titans taught me more than a decade at drama school ever could.
Nobody, least of all me, is advocating a return to the days when every town and city had its own company. Many of the smaller reps were threadbare even by the Seventies, and deserved to go to the wall: but the majority were strong, robust and exciting enterprises, with high production values, exacting standards and, crucially, with a real sense of belonging among the community in which they resided.
Perhaps Sir Ian’s anxieties about whether the next generation of Gambons, Denches and indeed McKellens will ever find the opportunity to discover their profound talent are premature. Talent, I suspect, will always out. But if so, their path is likely to be far more tortuous than that enjoyed by their predecessors.
Is it possible that I, too, could be merely peering back at these heady, far-off days through rose-tinted spectacles? Maybe – but if so, I’m in good company. Meeting Gary Oldman unexpectedly on Hungerford Bridge a few years ago, we stopped briefly to recall our days together, nearly four decades before. “Simmo,” he concluded, “I’m a movie star, I live in LA, I’ve had everything the business could offer me. But there are times when I’d throw it all away, just for one week back doing Privates on Parade at York.”
Oldman, is of course, one of our finest actors – but I’d like to think that on this occasion, he was telling the truth.

Who will David Cameron listen to on building in the countryside?
It was remarkable that Nadhim Zahawi, Conservative MP for Stratford-upon-Avon and member of the No 10 policy board, decided to attack the National Planning Policy Framework Prime Minister David Cameron with members of his advisory board on policy Photo: Getty Images	By Isabel Hardman
8:41PM GMT 09 Jan 2014

A Conservative MP complaining about the Government’s planning reforms is hardly as rare as hen’s teeth these days. Grumbles about what many MPs fear is a free-for-all that favours developers form a low-level backing track to Tory party life. But it was still remarkable when Nadhim Zahawi, the MP for Stratford-upon-Avon, decided to attack the National Planning Policy Framework this week. Mr Zahawi was simply repeating what many colleagues feel when he said the reforms were causing “physical harm” and “pain” to the countryside. His intervention was significant, though, because he is a member of the No 10 policy board – and he has now been told in no uncertain terms to support the planning reforms or resign. Initially, Tory MPs were encouraged that someone on this supposedly influential panel of MPs, helping the Prime Minister develop election-winning ideas, was prepared to speak up on planning. Mr Zahawi isn’t so encouraging, however. “This has nothing to do with the policy board,” he says. “I was speaking in my capacity as Stratford-upon-Avon’s MP.” He does not plan to raise it with the unit. And neither does the No 10 hierarchy plan to listen. There is clearly considerable frustration in Downing Street that Mr Zahawi has spoken out of turn only a few months after being appointed to the board. He and his fellow new members – Alun Cairns, Andrea Leadsom, Priti Patel and Chris Skidmore – had already been warned that, although they were not ministers, they were signing up to agree with Government policy. The reason the powers-that-be at No 10 took such care to state this was that they had only recently removed one of the board’s best-known members, Jesse Norman. The MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire had failed to turn up to the vote on Syria because he disagreed with military intervention. But the excitement about Mr Zahawi’s comments is a symptom of a bigger problem. This is that the purportedly “influential” policy board is not, in fact, influential at all. When it was set up in April 2013, it was a gesture from David Cameron to his party, to say that old wounds such as revolts over Europe and Lords reform should be left to heal. It was also a useful way of keeping MPs who had missed out on a promotion busy, happy and distracted from potential rebellions. And so the policy board was sold as a rather more exciting entity than it really is. It is simply a conduit between the back benches and the PM. Anyone who really works on policy in No 10 says that it’s entirely wrong to assume this group will have much to do with writing the 2015 manifesto. Jo Johnson, the head of the board, will be involved, but not the members. Mr Johnson runs the unit with an impressive iron discipline. He has put the fear of God into members over briefing the media about any idea they are working on (although Mr Zahawi seems considerably more relaxed about this than the other nine members). What has trickled out so far has hardly been game-changing: indeed, it is amusing that only the Stratford MP’s freelance outbursts have made it on to the front pages. Ministers, meanwhile, are unperturbed by its activities, preferring instead to fret about how much access Oliver Letwin is being given to the making of the manifesto (not a lot, at present).

We may hear less from Mr Zahawi if his colleagues succeed in threatening him into submission. But his was never an outburst that could change either Government or Tory policy. It is far more interesting that the Prime Minister has recently appointed Policy Exchange’s Alex Morton as his planning and housing adviser. Morton is a passionate advocate of increased housebuilding, but in a way that does not antagonise local communities. It will be his work, and that of advisers we never hear from, that exerts real sway over future policy. And if the No 10 board has so little actual influence, why should Mr Cameron worry what its members say? Planning

Louise Mensch demands Labour apology over 'sexist' tweets
Louise Mensch has written to the Labour Party to demand an apology over sexist” remarks by one of their MPs calling her a "little girl" and referring to her husband as her "master". Photo: Rex Features	By Rowena Mason, Political Correpsondent

The former Tory MP is outraged about comments on Twitter made by Austin Mitchell, who also suggested she was not a "good wife" for correcting her husband in public. His controversial tweet read: "Shut up Menschkin. A good wife doesn't disagree with her master in public and a good little girl doesn't lie about why she quit politics."
Mrs Mensch now wants Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, and Harriet Harman, the deputy leader, to "speak out and condemn the sexist comments".
In a letter to the pair, she wrote: "Mr Mitchell has not deleted nor withdrawn his tweet. He is a sitting Labour MP and neither of you have said a word about his behaviour. I trust you will correct this lack of leadership at the earliest opportunity."
She added: "At 41 I ceased to be a little girl around 33 years ago. That is a sexist way to describe a grown woman. And as for 'a good wife doesn't disagree with her master in public' - how is this acceptable behaviour in a senior Labour MP who holds the whip?"

Mrs Mensch also drew attention to the fact Mr Miliband has recently given a speech calling for comedians to stop publicly demeaning and belittling people. Amid calls for an apology, Mr Mitchell yesterday tweeted: "Calm down dears.Irony may be a low form of wit but it's clearly above my level.And yours.So my wife has banned me from tweeting today."
He later added: "Wife,three daughters,one granddaughter and Labour press office all demand that I withdraw my tweet.No chance of front bench now"
The Labour Party declined to comment but a source said: "Austin Mitchell has made clear the tweet was a joke not a serious comment. It’s not funny, it's understandable people find it offensive and it is not the view of the Labour Party."
Mr Mitchell appeared to be responding to the fact Mrs Mensch publicly contradicted her husband over the weekend. Peter Mensch, a US rock music manager, told an interviewer his wife stepped down from politics partly because she feared losing to Labour. However, Mrs Mensch, who has previously spoken out about suffering sexist abuse on the internet, says she moved to New York this summer purely to spend more time with her family. Mr Mitchell has previously used Twitter to suggest the BBC is "prejudiced towards women" because he claimed it discussed "vaginal atrophy" on National Menopause Day. He then admitted: "I am a failure when it comes to women. Yes it is National Menopause Day. The discussion was on ITV with Philip Schofield in a starring role."
He also said that "arresting the pop stars of the seventies for Savile related crimes means raiding old people's homes do raddled unreckognisable (sic) wrecks."
A member of staff in Mr Mitchell's office said: "Knowing Austin, he won't have meant to cause offence but it obviously has done."

One Hyde Park: The most expensive ghost town in the world?
They were hyped as the ultimate luxury flats. But has anyone moved in to London's exclusive One Hyde Park yet? Neil Tweedie reports Image 1 of 3	Photo: Bloomberg	Image 1 of 3	Image 1 of 3	Photo: PA	By Neil Tweedie
6:00AM BST 29 Jun 2011
Comments
The best thing that can be said about One Hyde Park is that it could have been much worse. This dull-fronted development of four blocks of galactically-priced flats is easily ignored as one tries to negotiate the hellish junction that connects Knightsbridge with the Brompton Road. Yes, there is a McLaren showroom at the base of one block with a Formula One car strapped to the wall, and a Rolex shop at the base of another, and some token bits of greenery protected from the exhaust fumes by glass boxes - a dystopian feature, that - but you can seethe your way through near-stationary traffic without paying too much attention to what the Royal Mail still insists is 100 Knightsbridge. Which is probably how the inmates like it. The hyper-rich people One Hyde Park was built to accommodate prefer not to be noticed in the main, certainly by people who may begrudge them their money. But if trouble does come calling, and manages to evade the sharp-suited muscle on the doors, there is always the panic room. One Hyde Park has it all: bomb-proof windows, rotating paintings-cum-television screens and cameras that allow you to check for dandruff on your back while grooming yourself in the mirror. Then there is the gourmet food delivery service provided by the neighbouring Mandarin Oriental hotel via an underground tunnel. Such features come at a cost, of course. The development contains Britain’s most expensive flat, a £136 million, three-storey apartment recently acquired by the Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. Mr Akhmetov, whose interests range from steel to hotels, is worth about £10 billion, making him the richest man in his country. So the £60 million he intends to spend on decorating his new pad will make only the smallest of dents in his bank balance. He and his wife Liliya, who is understood to have a fondness for London, are in good company, counting Russian oligarchs and Arab princes among their neighbours. But are there really any proper residents in this temple to conspicuous consumption? Or is One Hyde Park merely a “ghost block”, a repository for wealth, a safe place to park some money in an uncertain world? Related Articles

World's most expensive apartments open

Costing £1 billion, One Hyde Park is the creation of brothers Christian and Nick Candy, a double act who evoke admiration and disdain in equal measure. Fans of the thirty-something developers credit them with creating the current boom in super-luxury homes in London, while detractors accuse them of sponsoring invasive, tasteless developments. It can be safely assumed that the Prince of Wales is in the latter camp. He torpedoed the Candys’ plan to redevelop Chelsea Barracks into flats, persuading his fellow royals in Qatar to withdraw funding. Like the abortive Chelsea project, and the Shard skyscraper on the south bank of the Thames, One Hyde Park has been built with Qatari money. “The Candys invented hyper-luxury flats at £4,000 a square foot and kick-started the luxury flat boom,” says Peter Bill, who writes on the London property market. “One Hyde Park has set a new benchmark for the whole of the west London market.”
The Candys initially appeared to have over-stretched themselves with One Hyde Park. But their confidence in the hyper-luxury model appears to have paid off. Of the 86 or so flats in the development, more than 50 have been sold for £973 million. When outstanding contracts are completed that figure will rise to £1.25 billion. The Candys say the development company they run with the prime minister of Qatar now owns “under 25” flats. The developer received planning permission for 86 apartments but the final number is likely to be closer to 80 as some purchasers are choosing to merge apartments together. The figures suggest that the Candys and their Qatari backer have now covered their costs, and are about to start making serious money. “We sold over £100 million of apartments last week,” says Jessica Patrick, spokesman for the Candys, “and we anticipate achieving another £225 million of apartment sales this week alone.” But has anyone actually living there full-time? “There are over 20 nationalities represented at One Hyde Park and it is likely to be one of many homes for the residents living there,” she says. “These individuals will be travelling from country to country for business, spending time at their ski chalets in the winter, visiting their palaces in the Middle East, and their yachts in Cannes or Sardinia in the summer.”
Liam Bailey, of estate agents Knight Frank, says such people do not buy high-end properties purely as investments. “They want location - Knightsbridge, Mayfair, Belgravia - the area with Hyde Park at its centre, but they prefer modern developments or very-well-refurbished older properties. They are Russians, Arabs, Indians and Europeans - and now some Chinese - who spend some time in London each year. They have networks here - family, friends, business contacts - and they are often drawn by education - their children attend British schools and universities. The owner may not be in One Hyde Park all the time but chances are that his or her children or extended family may be staying there.”
Despite the rise of Asian cities, London still maintains its hold on the super-wealthy. Knight Frank publishes a global cities index that places the capital second only to New York in importance. That position is expected to remain unchanged in 10 years’ time, despite the rise of rivals like Shanghai. “The UK is perceived as a very safe place to be, both to invest in property, particularly the golden triangle of Knightsbridge, Belgravia and Mayfair, and in terms of security,” says Valerie Brecher, senior partner in a law firm that specialises in top-of-the-market conveyancing. “One Hyde Park won’t be a ghost block. People will live there, but I doubt all the time. These people are international, they travel. Some of the smaller units may have been bought with a view to letting but that is not the primary intention.”
The Candys, she says, have played a blinder with branding. “This has been branded as the best address in the world. The branding is very clever. It is also perceived to be a very safe building - a lot of the residents come from countries where they have to walk around with body guards.”
Ms Brecher has expanded her firm’s residential property arm to deal with the luxury boom, which she says began in earnest at the end of 2009. “The prices for these properties is going through the roof. There is a huge demand and the problem is shortage of the product. Quite unbelievable.”
Not everyone is a fan of London’s status as a haven for the super rich, some of them people with murky histories. Richard Murphy runs the website Tax Research, which seeks to shed light on tax avoidance and evasion. Many luxury property purchases, he says, are exercises in concealment. Buyers use offshore companies, usually owned by so-called discretionary trusts that mask the identity of the real owner. The use of offshore structures allows wealthy non-domiciles to avoid paying millions in stamp duty when their London homes are sold because only shares are transferred. Such arrangements mean their wealth never technically touches British shores, protecting it from other forms of taxation such as capital gains tax. Even council tax rates are on the reasonable side for those living at One Hyde Park. Mr Akhmetov will pay just £755.60 in council tax to Westminster Council for the year 2011-12, plus £619.64 to the Greater London Authority. But the total annual charge of £1,375 is still less than the national average of £1,398 for a Band D property. “This is conspicuous consumption gone mad," says Mr Murphy. “Britain is uniquely generous to the ultra-rich of the world, the justification being that these people bring money, entrepreneurial expertise and jobs into the UK. There is absolutely no evidence to support this assertion. “It makes the UK a tax haven, and it makes the UK a two-tier society based on accident of birth and nationality, which is discriminatory. These people are blatantly rubbing their tax-free status in the noses of British taxpayers, which could lead some people to say, 'If they can get away with it, what can I get away with?’ This is highly counter-productive for the UK.”
Would he like to live in One Hyde Park? “No. I look out of my window at the beautiful Norfolk countryside. Why on earth would I want to live there?”

Sepp Blatter given embarrassing nickname on World Cup award
Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, received an award from the South African government under an unwelcome nickname after his Wikipedia entry was apparently sabotaged. Sepp Blatter was accidentally referred to as Bellend after an internet hoax Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Murray Wardrop
8:47AM BST 15 Jul 2010
Comments
The 74-year-old was recognised with the Order of The Companions of O R Tambo for his contribution over the World Cup. However, an official website announcing the accolade referred to the Swiss as “Joseph Sepp Bellend Blatter”. It is thought that Blatter’s profile on Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, was targeted by pranksters who altered his name, which was then copied onto the government website. Both websites have since been amended, removing the reference to Bellend, which is a slang term for a penis. The joke follows criticism of the football chief for refusing to allow goal-line technology in the tournament, which would have proved Frank Lampard scored against Germany. Related Articles

Online football forums were awash with comments about the blunder after it was spotted on the website for the South African presidency. One England fan remarked: “It just goes to show that 50 million people are not wrong!” Another added: “So is this the first official, presidentially sanctioned bellend in history?” Blatter received his Gold award at a gala dinner on Monday from South African President, Jacob Zuma. The accolade is one of the country’s highest distinctions and is bestowed on foreign citizens for contributions to peace, co-operation and the active expression of solidarity and support. Announcing the award, Mr Zuma said: “After FIFA awarded us the opportunity to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup on 15 May 2004, we embraced the tasks that you entrusted to us, working together as a nation. “The hosting of the 2010 World Cup has helped us consolidate the gains we achieved after attaining freedom in 1994.” Oliver Tambo was a former president in exile of the African National Congress (ANC) and played a significant role in mobilising international opposition to apartheid, setting up the first liberation movement missions in Egypt, Morocco, Ghana and London. Accepting his award, Blatter said: “I just have to express my thanks but my emotions are now overcoming my voice. “I'm touched by this honour. I would like to thank President Zuma and all the people of South Africa for this gesture. I take it for FIFA, the football family and my own family.” Asked for a comment about the name blunder, a spokesman for FIFA's Swiss HQ told The Sun: "I need to communicate the meaning of the word internally first."
