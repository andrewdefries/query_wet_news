Would you help to fund a new Morrissey album?
Morrissey hasn't had a record deal since 2009, so singer Amanda Palmer has offered to petition his fans for money to release a new album. Please, please, please, let me get what I want: Morrissey performing in 2006 Photo: Andrew Kendall	By Alice Vincent, Entertainment writer, online

Morrissey is able to sell out 20,000 capacity venues and stop meat being sold where he plays, but he hasn't been able to get a record deal since releasing his 2009 album Years of Refusal. So Amanda Palmer, singer-songwriter and half of American band The Dresden Dolls, has offered to help Morrissey out by raising the funds from his fan base to release an album independently. Writing on American news website Salon, Palmer set the former Smiths frontman a business offer, saying she would be "totally keen to help you crowdfund", and estimated that the Morrissey fan base would be able to raise $2.5 million (£1.6 million) to release a new album. Palmer based this on an "experiment", in which she asked her 850,000 Twitter followers if they would pay $5 to pre-order a digital-only Morrissey album. She received upwards of 1,400 tweets saying they would, potentially raising $7,000. Palmer, who counts herself amongst Morrissey's fans and "singing, songwriting spawn", reckoned that his fame would result in far more money being contributed. Related Articles

She would know: Palmer used crowd funding website Kickstarter to raise $1.2 million (£773,000) to release her album Theater of Evil in 2012.

However, Morrissey, who is 53, has always been adamant that he would not release an album without the backing of a major label. A month ago he told The Hollywood Reporter that he has "no DIY instincts" and would be ignored by the music world without a major label, who "have the machinery" for musical success, including Grammy awards. Perhaps Palmer's plea will work: without a record label, she says, Morrissey wouldn't have to tour and risk his heath (he's had to cancel the rest of his recent North American tour due to double pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer) and would own all the material, with an advance of $1.5 million.
