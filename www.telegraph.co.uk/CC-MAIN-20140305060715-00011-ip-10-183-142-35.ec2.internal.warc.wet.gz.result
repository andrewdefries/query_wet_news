RI:SE (2002-2003)
The replacement for The Big Breakfast didn’t so much rise as flop. Badly. It lasted just 20 months. Some of the hosts were terrible (remember the awkward pairing of Iain Lee and Kate Lawler?) and unsurprisingly Channel 4 have been cautious in trying to continue a breakfast show format.

London set for mobile coverage on Underground trains
Passengers on the London Underground will soon be able to make mobile phone calls and access email for the first time.
Alcatel-Lucent claims the boost in productivity as workers to check their emails on the move would be worth £1.1bn to the economy. Photo: PA	By Katherine Rushton

The French telecoms firm Alcatel-Lucent is in talks to install mobile and broadband connectivity across the entire Tube network. The deal would include London Underground trains, as well as the Tube stations, which are already scheduled to receive wi-fi access later this year.
Ben Verwaayen, chief executive of Alcatel-Lucent, disclosed that the company would start by introducing broadband and mobile phone reception.
“Phase one is that you can communicate under circumstances where today you can’t.” he said. “You can’t use your iPad today everywhere in the London Underground. You should, so that’s what we’re doing. We help to make sure that the coverage is there. You sit there in the train and you want to work in the train. That’s what we’re doing.”
After that roll-out is complete, Alcatel-Lucent will introduce specialist features designed to help commuters get around the capital. It would be similar to the facility at some bus stops whereby users can find out how long they have to wait by sending a text requesting information or pointing their smartphone at a code printed on the stop.
“We’re going to allow you to sit in the train and think, if I make this connection where could I go? So you make a personal travel plan. That’s the next phase.”

Mr Verwaayen declined to comment on the timing or cost of the roll-out, but indicated that an Alcatel-Lucent deal was “not a hypothetical, it is coming”.
The boost in productivity, as workers to check their emails and make calls on the move, would be worth around £1.1bn to the British economy, Alcatel-Lucent claimed.
It would also draw a line under a series of failed attempts to introduce mobile coverage to the Underground. In 2011, the Chinese network Huawei offered to make the £50m upgrade as a gift to the British government. However, the deal fell apart in the face of public scepticism about the Chinese company’s motives. The company is routinely accused of being able to use its network for spying, a charge which it denies.
The Alcatel-Lucent roll-out follows plans to install wireless broadband access at tube stations, announced earlier this year. The service, which will be paid for by Virgin Media and also uses Alcatel-Lucent technology, will launch at 80 London stations by July, starting with Oxford Circus, Stratford, Liverpool Street, Leicester Square and King’s Cross.

Surgeon faced investigation for refusing to treat health tourist
Surgeon who exposed health tourism scandal was investigated by General Medical Council for refusing free treatment to ineligible health tourist
By Andrew Gilligan
9:00PM GMT 02 Nov 2013
Comments
The surgeon who exposed the scandal of “health tourism” in the NHS spoke out after being investigated by the General Medical Council for refusing to give an ineligible health tourist free treatment.
Prof Meirion Thomas
The regulator subjected Prof Joseph Meirion Thomas, who has 44 years’ experience in the health service, to a “fitness to practise investigation” after a complaint by the patient, a non-EU national who had never lived or worked in the UK.
Prof Meirion Thomas was cleared, but said that professional rules were one of many barriers to tackling the problem, claimed to cost the NHS up to £2 billion a year.
“If I recognise a patient as being ineligible, I am not allowed to declare that — because the minute that patient walks in to see me, I have a duty of confidentiality to that patient,” he said. “I cannot even tell my overseas visitor officer [a hospital official with the job of recovering money from non-NHS patients] that I am suspicious the patient is there illegally. The loopholes are phenomenal.” Related Articles

Health tourism 'costing NHS billions'
03 Apr 2013
Prof Meirion Thomas, senior cancer surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, said he believed that around 5 per cent of the patients he treated were health tourists who had come to Britain specifically for free treatment.
“One of the most awful things that happens to me is that I have to cancel surgery for a legitimate patient because of a health tourist who is ineligible for care,” he said. “That really, really bothers me.” NHS rules specify that cancer patients must start treatment within 62 days of being referred, meaning that some health tourists take precedence over British patients.
In evidence last week to the Commons committee considering the Immigration Bill, Prof Meirion Thomas said two London hospitals “talk about the Lagos shuttle” of women from west Africa who come for free NHS maternity treatment.
The hospitals concerned are Guy’s and St Thomas’s, which with many others in London has a high proportion of overseas patients. Other hospitals have noticed sharp rises in foreign patients demanding treatment. Hospitals in Southend and South Essex saw a leap in such patients, many from Portugal, when easyJet started operating from the local airport.
Jacqueline Bishop, an overseas visitor officer from the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton, said that NHS financial structures, where “clinical commissioning groups” of GPs pay hospitals for the patients they treat, actively discouraged hospitals from looking for health tourists. “I generate a loss. Every overseas visitor I identify, I cannot charge the clinical commissioning group for,” she said. “There are NHS trusts out there who do not identify overseas visitors, because it is not in their best interests. We are penalised for identifying overseas visitors.” As a result of this, she added, the NHS had no real idea how big the problem was, but she said that abuse of maternity facilities by health tourists was “rife” . “Anybody who says that they do not have overseas visitors in maternity either are not doing their jobs properly or just have their head in the sand,” she said.
Only about 20 per cent of charges due from overseas visitors are ever recovered.
Prof Meirion Thomas said the health tourist who took him to the GMC had been to two other hospitals seeking free treatment. “He came to me with a CT [computer-processed X-ray] scan from outside the EU dated 10 days before,” he said. “He had been to three hospitals. He accused me of unethical behaviour because I would not promote his application with my trust for immediate and free NHS care.” Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, has promised to tackle the abuse of health tourism, imposing a £200 charge on some visitors seeking medical treatment, though many will still not have to pay it. However, doctors’ leaders warned that it could become the world’s cheapest private insurance scheme, with most health tourists coming for procedures costing the taxpayer thousands or tens of thousands of pounds.

Woman's body recovered from landslide in Cornwall
Rescuers have removed a woman's body from a house which collapsed in landslide following heavy rain in Cornwall as severe weather blights Britain.
8:58AM GMT 23 Mar 2013
A landslide and floodwater in Cornwall, thought to have been triggered by torrential rain, smashed through a block of flats yesterday partially collapsing the building. Last night emergency crews and specialist investigators found a woman's body after picking through debris at the Veronica flats in Looe. The body is believed to be that of Susan Norman, a grandmother in her 60s who had not been heard from since returning to the flat on Thursday night. Contains video from APTN
