New Great Gatsby trailer reveals Beyoncé soundtrack
Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan star in the new trailer for Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of The Great Gatsby, which features music from Beyoncé and Lana Del Rey. 8:03AM BST 05 Apr 2013
Comments
Luhrmann's version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the decadent Jay Gatsby, Tobey Maguire as narrator Nick Carraway and Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan. The action remains set in the 1920s, but the music is a decidedly modern mix of 21st century rap, rock and pop. Jay-Z is the executive producer of the soundtrack, which features a cover of Amy Winehouse's single "Back to Black" by Beyoncé and OutKast's Andre 3000, as well as tracks by Florence and the Machine, Lana Del Rey and Jack White. "The Great Gatsby" is due to open the Cannes Film Festival, and will be released in UK cinemas on May 16. Related Articles

Government has 'anti-enterprise undercurrent'
Impact of policies designed to clear up mess left by financial crisis will will mainly fall on the directors of smaller companies, argues IoD chief Simon Walker. Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, said that he supported “country-by-country” proposals first put forward by the European Parliament that would mean all businesses detailing the contribution they make to the state. Photo: PA	By Simon Walker
7:01PM BST 15 Aug 2013
Comments
At the beginning of July, Vince Cable, the Secretary of State for Business, published a set of proposals seeking to enhance the transparency of UK company ownership and increase trust in UK business.
This followed the G8 Summit, where the British government was keen to put such proposals at the heart of the international agenda. The resulting “Transparency and Trust” initiative is a timely intervention, given the reputational blow suffered by UK business in the wake of the financial crisis. Debates over executive pay and scandals such as banks’ interest rate rigging have raised further questions about how our businesses are run.
However, it is regrettable that the impact of most of the key measures will mainly fall on the directors of smaller companies. The current image problem of UK business is not of their making. Furthermore, there is an anti-enterprise undercurrent in some of the Government’s ideas which urgently needs to be challenged.
The “transparency” part of the Government’s agenda seeks to crack down on so-called “anonymous companies” which exploit the corporate form for the purpose of concealing their true owners and beneficiaries. Such opaque structures can be used to obscure a range of undesirable activities, such as tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing.
The Government plans to create a central registry of beneficial owners, and potentially outlaw or reform mechanisms such as bearer shares, nominee directors and corporate directors, which can also be used to conceal underlying ownership.

How to successfully launch a new product
15 Aug 2013
Despite the good intentions, there will be significant practical problems involved in determining who really controls companies. Those who wish to conceal their activities are hardly likely to volunteer this information but it is nonetheless a worthwhile exercise, given the damage that faceless corporations can inflict on our economy and society. It also makes sense for the register to be fully in the public domain where it can be subject to some degree of public scrutiny.
Of greater concern is the punitive approach that the Government is adopting towards the directors of unsuccessful companies. One proposal is that a director could be disqualified, or pronounced unfit to be a director, if they have been involved in an undetermined number of previous company failures. This would be imposed even if no wrongdoing had been established. The idea behind this proposal is that creditors need to be protected against the “honest incompetent” director who bumbles around from one company failure to another, leaving chaos in his wake. This kind of traditional British attitude to business failure should no longer be accepted.
The market economy is a system that works through a process of entrepreneurial experimentation. Many leading entrepreneurs – such as Bill Gates, Henry Ford, Akio Morita (the founder of Sony), Walt Disney and Sir Richard Branson – experienced major setbacks or failures on their road to success. Does the Government really believe that all the young people taking part in its recently launched start-up loans initiative will succeed in business at their first, second or even third attempt?
An unsympathetic approach to business failure is also embodied in the suggestion that company liquidators should be given the power to “sell on” the civil action liabilities of directors following a company failure. This would create a “market” for director’s liabilities which could be bought or sold, and raises the spectre of directors being pursued for their possessions by debt collectors or “bounty hunters” with no previous connection to the company.
Whilst there is an understandable desire to hold directors to account, we need to strike a balance. Any corporate enterprise involves risks which are shared among the various company stakeholders, such as shareholders, creditors, employees and directors. If an excessive portion of risk is loaded on to one group – such as the directors – the result will be counterproductive, not only for directors themselves but also for the wider economy.
The risks and challenges involved in taking on the role of company director, already significant, will become prohibitive. In particular, there will be fewer takers for the role of director in small and medium-sized enterprises, which expose directors to much greater risk of corporate failure and subsequent financial sanction than board positions at large organisations.
In view of the Government’s recent efforts, as part of its Growth Strategy, to encourage seasoned directors to share their knowledge and experience on the boards of the UK’s nascent “Mittelstand” group of mid-sized businesses, that would be an unfortunate development. Furthermore, there is little evidence that corporate insolvencies are holding back the current recovery, although the same cannot be said of the lending policies of the large banks.
The Government makes the interesting proposal that a director training “boot camp” could be offered to those directors facing disqualification in return for a reduced sanction.
This is a good idea, and the IoD stands ready to help provide this training. However, if training is of value to disqualified directors, it begs the question: why it is not equally encouraged for directors before they get into trouble?
Frankly, it is surprising that in such a complex and regulated economy, the idea persists that directorships can effectively be practised by almost anyone over the age of 16 – with no form of preparation whatsoever. Given the new personal risks for directors proposed by the Government, it is a brave director who shares such a carefree philosophy.
Measures designed to increase transparency and accountability are to be welcomed, but with a fragile economic recovery on the horizon the Government must be sure not to penalise risk or discourage people from joining the boards of our vital small and medium-sized companies. Simon Walker is director general of the Institute of Directors

Football chiefs in TV row talks
12:01AM BST 01 Apr 2002
FOOTBALL League chiefs are set to consider their next move in the struggle to recoup television money owed them by ITV Digital. A meeting between the League and representatives from 24 First Division clubs will outline the organisation's legal position and the possibility of action against the TV company. The League may also consider a settlement with ITV Digital, which went into administration last week with £179 million owing from its contract. Many First Division and lower league clubs face an uncertain future if the latest payout from the TV deal - due on August 1 - is not forthcoming. ITV Digital had agreed a £315 million three-year contract to cover Nationwide League and Worthington Cup matches. It subsequently offered £50 million for the remaining two years of the deal after struggling financially in the face of an advertising slowdown. Related Articles
The crucial meeting of the First Division clubs will be led by Keith Harris, chairman of the Football League, and chief executive David Burns. It is thought the pair could reiterate their belief that ITV Digital's co-owners Granada and Carlton are liable for the outstanding amount. At a time when many clubs are in urgent need of cash, any legal action is unlikely to be resolved quickly. ITV Digital said at the weekend that it could not comment while it was in talks with the Football League. But reports suggested the channel may raise its initial offer of £50 million to £70 million and also give the television rights back to the clubs in a deal worth up to £90 million. News

Eric Pickles appeals for Tory unity over PM's Europe speech
Tory MPs should “come together” after David Cameron delivers his speech on Europe on Wednesday, a Cabinet minister has said. Mr Cameron faces a difficult balancing act between the demands of his own party and shoring up Britain's influence in the world Photo: REX	By Tim Ross, Political Correspondent
5:55PM GMT 21 Jan 2013
Follow Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, said unity among Conservatives over European policy was vital for the future of the party, and the health of the country. The Prime Minister will finally set out his vision for Britain’s future relationship with Brussels after his much-delayed speech was postponed again by the hostage crisis in Algeria. Downing Street said Mr Cameron would make his announcement in central London on Wednesday after he was forced to cancel plans to give it in Amsterdam as the terrorist siege worsened last Friday. Mr Cameron has been under pressure from restive backbenchers to call a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union and has been considering his response for many months. Mr Pickles said he had seen Mr Cameron's speech and was “very happy” with its content. Related Articles

Cameron's EU speech is cold comfort
22 Jan 2013
Asked whether the Prime Minister could quell unrest over Europe among Tory MPs, Mr Pickles said: “I think so. I think there is a willingness and a desire to come together. “We recognise that it is immensely important to come together, not just for our political future but for our industrial and social future.” Earlier this month, Mr Pickles said he hoped Britain could remain a member of the EU, but suggested it should not do so “at any price”. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said the Prime Minister's schedule this week meant he could not travel to Europe to unveil the plan, as had been hoped. Instead, he will outline how he intends to seek the “fresh consent” of the public for a new relationship between Britain and Brussels at a venue in central London on Wednesday morning, before Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons. The speech was originally due to be delivered last autumn, before being pushed back to December and then January after a series of rethinks and unexpected events. It was firmly scheduled for Tuesday, but that date was scrapped last week because it clashed with a ceremony celebrating a Franco-German friendship treaty. President Obama’s inauguration ceremony in Washington also ruled out Monday of this week. Mr Cameron has said that he favours the UK remaining in the EU, but on “renegotiated” terms. However, reports over the weekend indicated that the Prime Minister would offer voters a choice at a referendum - expected in 2018 - on whether to quit the union altogether. According to advance extracts released last week, Mr Cameron will warn that Britain could "drift towards the exit" from the EU unless there is real change in Brussels. He identified the crisis in the eurozone, the challenge of economic competitiveness and the issue of democratic legitimacy as key issues which must be resolved in negotiations on the future shape of the EU. As the speech will be focused on the period after the next election, Mr Cameron is expected to detail Conservative policy, and is likely to dismay leading Liberal Democrats. On Sunday, Dr Liam Fox, the former Defence Secretary and an arch eurosceptic, said he was “broadly satisfied” with what he believed Mr Cameron would say. The MP, who remains influential among Right-wing backbenchers, called for an “in-out” referendum to “settle the argument” over whether Britain should leave the EU. Politics

Fifth of new iPhone customers switch from Android
Apple may be losing ground to Android and Microsoft in the smartphone operating system market, but the company is still succeeding in winning customers from its number one rival, Samsung. An Apple iPhone 4Ss and a Samsung Galaxy S III Photo: Reuters	By Sophie Curtis

Apple has taken three times as many customers from Samsung as Samsung has taken from Apple in the past year, according to a new study of US consumers. Figures published by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) also reveal that 20 per cent of Apple's iPhone customers over the past year were switching from an Android phone, but only 7 per cent of Samsung buyers had previously owned an iPhone. While this is good news for Apple, the company is still struggling to attract first-time smartphone buyers. The report states that Samsung drew 37 per cent of customers upgrading from so-called feature phones, compared to 26 per cent who chose Apple. "Samsung gets more customers upgrading from basic phones than Apple does. However, there are significant differences between Apple and Samsung buyers that switch brands, and those that remain," said CIRP in its report. "Samsung buyers are mostly prior Android and basic phone owners. Apple owners similarly come from iOS, with a smaller share of these customers coming from basic phones. 42 per cent of Apple customers already have the Apple iOS operating system, while 43 per cent of Samsung customers have Android."

The figures are based on surveys of smartphone buyers from July 2012-June 2013, comprising four quarterly surveys. Each survey consists of 500 subjects who had purchased a mobile phone in the preceding 90 days. The survey also gathered demographic data, which showed that Apple's customers tend to be richer and better educated than Samsung's. However, iPhone owners tend to be a little younger, with 69 per cent aged between 18 and 34. Among switchers, Samsung drew more customers from HTC, Motorola, and Nokia, while Apple drew more from Blackberry. Figures from research firm IDC earlier this month revealed that Apple’s share in the global smartphone operating system market has decreased, while Android and Microsoft’s offerings have gained. The Apple operating system shipped 32.2 million units in the second quarter, up from 26 million for the same period in 2012, but its market share fell to 13.2 per cent from 16.6 per cent. Meanwhile, Android’s cemented its position at the top of the smartphone operating systems table with a 79.3 per cent share of the market, up from 69.1 per cent. Technology News
