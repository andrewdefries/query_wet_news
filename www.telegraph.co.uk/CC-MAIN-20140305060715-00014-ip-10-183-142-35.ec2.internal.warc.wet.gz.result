Lack of skills leaves employers struggling to fill vacancies
Three in four employers are struggling to fill vacant jobs due to a lack of skills in the labour market, despite high unemployment. Experts said employers, bruised by the recession, were increasingly "picky" about who they take on and less willing to take a risk, demanding "perfect" job applicants and ignoring those with potential. By Louisa Peacock, Jobs Editor

Much-needed specialist and technical skills have become harder to find over the past year, with sought-after staff staying put in their current roles for job security, the annual survey of 626 employers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) and Hays recruitment firm showed. However, one third of employers admitted they have lost potential recruits because of their own lengthy hiring process. Experts said employers, bruised by the recession, were increasingly "picky" about who they take on and less willing to take a risk, demanding "perfect" job applicants and ignoring those with potential. The typical cost of filling a senior manager's vacancy is £7,500, the CIPD said. But as official unemployment figures today are expected to show little signs of improvement, the CIPD urged employers to work more closely with recruitment agencies to assess the skills available and adapt roles to suit. Claire McCartney, CIPD resourcing adviser, said there was undoubtedly a "mismatch" between the individuals available and what industry needs. Major skills gaps – particularly in managerial and technical roles – were masked by the recession and are returning now the jobs market is improving. But, she said: "There is a growing trend for organisations to make new roles really niche and that's contributing to the problem. We've seen an increase in the length of time it takes to recruit someone which means employers are becoming more risk averse."

Grayling: jobs figures 'step in right direction'
15 Jun 2011
Jim Hillage, an adviser at the Institute for Employment Studies, said: "Employers are more picky than they used to be. The recession means that they are less likely to invest in someone and they want someone who is job-ready." He said employers struggling to attract the very best people should consider upping pay, to "entice" workers from their current jobs. This may not be necessary for some time, though, with a TUC analysis out today suggesting the UK is still five years off pre-recession jobs levels. Experts believe it is still an employers' market, with no real upward pressure on pay. Young people are continuing to get pushed out of the jobs market, however. Separate research today suggests almost half of employers are refusing to hire young people or fresh graduates over the next year, citing a lack of experience as the main barrier. Half are stereotyping Britain's youth generation, believing under-25s cannot be relied upon to turn up on time, if at all. Some 45pc think young people cannot communicate properly, while a third say they won't hire them because of their "inappropriate" appearance, the survey of 526 employers by Ethical Skills & Training (EST) showed. Elaine Barrett, of EST, said: "It's disheartening to think that employers seem to be positively discriminating against 18-24 year olds, consigning them to the employment scrap-heap even before they have had the chance to get their foot on the career ladder." Mr Hillage warned employers generally had a "negative view" of young people, based on misconceptions they will be a more risky hire. But this approach could land businesses in trouble, according to Edward Goodwyn, an employment partner at Pinsent Masons law firm, who warned employers discriminating during recruitment could end up at a tribunal. "Young people might come out of university with a degree or skill-set that is required by industry. Employers would need to think very carefully over what their reasons are for picking one candidate over another," he said. Find postgraduate courses at Telegraph Courses Jobs

Bedfordshire police rescue 24 'slaves' in dawn raid One hundred police officers backed up by firearms officers, dogs and a force helicopter raided a caravan site in Bedfordshire early this morning to rescue victims of slavery.
11:57AM BST 11 Sep 2011
Twenty-four men were taken from the site who are believed to have been held as slaves at the site and forced to live appalling conditions and made to work for no pay.
They were from English and Eastern European backgrounds and were taken from the Greenacre caravan site in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, to an undisclosed medical reception centre where health professionals were waiting to to see if they required medical attention
This morning's dawn swoop on the site at 5.30 followed weeks of intelligence gathering by police who believed people were being held there against their will.
Three men and a woman living on the site in Leighton Buzzard were arrested in connection with alleged slavery offences and were taken to police station across the county and in neighbouring Hertfordshire.
Officers from the The Beds and Herts Major Crime Unit backed up by specialist unit were involved in the raid.

Search warrants had been granted and the arrests were made under the Slavery and Servitude Act 2010.
Detective Chief Inspector Sean O'Neil from the Beds and Herts Major Crime Unit said "The men we found at the site were in a poor state of physical health and the conditions they were living in were shockingly filthy and cramped.
"We believe that some of them had been living and working there in a state of virtual slavery, some for just a few weeks and others for up to 15 years.
"Because of the number of victims and suspects size of the site, we needed the assistance from specialist units."

'Expect to be shot if you burgle gun owners', judge warns criminals
A judge has defended the rights of people to protect their homes, telling two burglars shot during a break-in: “That is the chance you take.”

9:30PM BST 26 Sep 2012
Joshua O’Gorman and Daniel Mansell were blasted with a legally-held shotgun after they smashed their way into the isolated rural home of a businessman, Andy Ferrie, and his wife Tracey last month. The two men, who have a string of convictions between them, were arrested when they arrived at hospital seeking treatment for their injuries. Mr and Mrs Ferrie were also arrested and questioned for more than 40 hours on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. They were later released without charge. O’Gorman and Mansell appeared at Leicester Crown Court where they were both jailed for four years after admitting burglary. In a move welcomed by justice campaigners, Judge Michael Pert QC, told the pair they could not expect any leniency simply because they had been wounded in the incident. He told them: “If you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a legally-held shotgun, that is the chance you take. You cannot come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it.”

Victim relives burglary ordeal
27 Sep 2012
O’Gorman, 27, and Mansell, 33, both of no fixed address, had pleaded guilty to breaking into the Ferries’ isolated cottage in Welby, near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire in the early hours of Sept 2. Andrew Frymann, mitigating for O’Gorman, said that being shot had been like a “near-death experience” for which his client was not prepared. Responding to the barrister’s suggestion that O’Gorman was traumatised by the experience, Judge Pert said the arrest of Mr and Mrs Ferrie was just as severe. “Some might argue that being arrested and locked up for 40 hours is a trauma,” he said. The judge’s remarks were widely welcomed by those arguing that the justice system needs to be more on the side of the victim of crime rather than the perpetrator. Alan Duncan, the international development minister and the Ferries’ constituency MP, backed the couple’s actions at the time and welcomed the sentence and the judge’s remarks. Speaking from the United Nations in New York, the Tory minister said: “Three cheers for the judge; he has been robust and sensible. Justice has been done and, as I said from the start, the culprits are the culprits and the victims are the victims. The police did a very good job and investigated as thoroughly as they had to when a firearm is involved.”
Patrick Mercer, an MP who has campaigned for a change in the law to allow home owners more protection when defending their property, also welcomed the sentencing remarks. He said: “These are remarkably sensible comments from Judge Pert and will be widely welcomed. The judge has shown that he has his finger on the pulse of the nation and it is a welcome contrast to the extraordinary comments of Judge Peter Bowers when he recently described burglars as demonstrating bravery.”
Mr Mercer added: “The criminal law needs to be brought in line with the civil law where the threshold is set at grossly disproportionate force, rather than simply unreasonable force.”
Sir Clive Loader, the Conservative candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner in Leicestershire, said: “The penalty for burglary is not death, either by the State or by the person whose house you break into. “But on the other hand, if you go into someone’s home in the dead of night, wearing a balaclava in an extremely frightening way, what might follow as a result is not entirely predictable.”
Mrs Ferrie’s mother believed the burglars had got off lightly. Hazel Towell, 63, from Burton-on-Trent, said: “I don’t think four years is nearly enough. It’s no deterrent to villains like these. “They put Tracey and Andrew through hell.”
Alan Murphy, prosecuting, said Mansell was released from prison in May last year after serving part of a six-year sentence for wounding with intent. In total, his criminal record consisted of eight previous convictions involving 19 offences. O’Gorman had 16 previous convictions involving 27 offences. The debate over the right to defend property began when Tony Martin killed a burglar at his Norfolk home in 1999 and was convicted of murder and jailed for life. The sentence was reduced on appeal to manslaughter and five years’ jail. Last year Peter Flanagan, who fatally stabbed an armed burglar at his home in Salford, Great Manchester, escaped prosecution after he was found to have been acting in self defence. Vincent and Karen Cooke describe the night they were burgled at knifepoint by two men, and the ordeal after Vincent killed one of them in a struggle
