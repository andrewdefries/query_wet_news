Heathrow looks to build third runway to south-west
Heathrow Airport is said to be changing its plans for a third runway and considering building a new one to the south-west of its site, rather than to the north.
The plan is thought to be among a range of potential expansion routes that will be submitted by Heathrow to the Airports Commission by July 17 Photo: Getty Images	By Emma Rowley

Management of the transport hub are working on an expansion plan to develop the existing airport towards Stanwell Moor village in Surrey, which might mean fewer properties would need to be demolished, it has been reported.
An earlier proposal to expand northwards, which would have affected the villages of Harmondsworth and Sipson, was accepted by the last Labour government but then rejected after the Coalition gained power.
The intention behind the latest plan is thought to be to minimise the impact of the increased noise coming from an expanded airport, which is seen as a major stumbling block to development. Heathrow is now the world’s busiest international airport, transporting 70m passengers a year.
Building towards Stanwell Moor should mean most residents living under the flightpaths of the existing two runways would not face much more noise, according to reports. It could, however, present more disturbance for people living in the Twickenham and Richmond Park areas and beyond.
The plan is thought to be among a range of potential expansion routes that will be submitted by Heathrow to the Airports Commission by July 17. The commission, headed by the former Financial Services Authority chairman, Sir Howard Davies, will publish a report by the end of this year on how Britain’s aviation capacity problems can be improved. Its final recommendations on where to build new runways in the South East will be delivered in 2015.

Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, is opposed to any expansion and wants a new airport situated in the Thames Estuary. Daniel Moylan, his chief aviation adviser, said: “Even to discuss the option of Stanwell is to add a new blight to the lives of thousands of south-west Londoners... And for what? A third runway will be full to capacity as soon as it opens.”
However, aviation experts have warned that Heathrow will be forced to close if Mr Johnson, gets his way.
A spokeswoman for Heathrow declined to comment on the reports.

We had hundreds of entrants hoping to take home the coveted title of Marshalls/Daily Telegraph Amateur Garden Designer 2004. Here are the winners... and their outstanding work that thrilled the judges
Now in its second year, the Marshalls/Daily Telegraph Amateur Garden Design Award has gone from strength to strength. The judges - The Daily Telegraph's gardening editor Tiffany Daneff, Michael Walker of Marshalls plc and Mitch Westwood of design and construction specialists Xternal Dimensions - were delighted by the continuing range and quality of entries. "I particularly enjoy discovering how our readers garden and think about gardening, finding out what size of garden they have and how much they know about plants. It's really useful feedback," says Tiffany. "I was also astounded by our readers' artistry - there were some really beautifully illustrated plans." This year, the competition invited designs based on four styles of gardening: The Socialising Garden, The Gardener's Garden, The Exotic Garden and The Wildlife Garden. The winning design from reader Sarah Wheeldon, of Winchester, Hampshire, is for a Socialising Garden. "Even on paper the design invites the observer in," says Tiffany. "It's come from a real knowledge of the space and how she wants to use it. The balance between hard and soft landscaping was particularly impressive given how much she has fitted in to the design."

12 Jun 2004
Michael Walker, hard landscaping expert at Marshalls, couldn't agree more. "Sarah's design has everything you'd want in a garden," he says. "And it was very well set out. Many a professional designer would be proud to have come up with a plan like hers."
He believes that thanks to TV makeovers, people are far more willing to have a go at transforming their own garden. "What starts out as a scribble on the back of an envelope becomes a drawing, the drawing becomes a scale plan and the whole thing matures into a full-blown project," he says. "People now have the confidence to try it for themselves." Michael was also impressed with how entrants had studied the range of Marshalls landscaping products and found the right one for their design. "We are always trying to anticipate lifestyle trends and tailor our products to what people want and the way the winners have used our products shows we are getting it right."
Fellow judge Mitch Westwood also finds it encouraging that home-owners everywhere are taking even more of an interest in their outdoor spaces. "We're in the business of creating gardens for people and their greater awareness makes our job easier, we're preaching to the converted, so to speak," says Mitch. "When we present our ideas people can relate to them more easily."
He, too, cites TV makeovers as an enormously positive influence. "Programmes like Ground Force have helped raise the profile of garden design," he says. "People are much more open-minded: 10 to 15 years ago it was all lawns and borders. Now people are much more adventurous." And the Marshalls/Daily Telegraph competition itself, of course, is a factor too. "Unbelievably the standards are up from last year," says Mitch. "It was very difficult to judge. Sarah's winning design is very good - it's got a lot of nice elements and I'm looking forward to building it." For inspirational ideas on creating 10 themed garden designs read Lifescapes: Garden Designs for Your Lifestyle by Sven Wombwell. This hardbacked book is priced at £10 and is available at www.futurelifescapes.co.uk, or by calling 0870 200 9200. Overall Winner Sarah WheeldonThe Socialising Garden
Sarah Wheeldon wins the overall prize of a £10,000 makeover. But this is not for her, but for her friend Emma's garden. "Emma was a real support when I had a skiing accident and I wanted to do something for her, to put a sparkle into her life," she says. "I didn't tell Emma I was entering - I had to do everything in secret, sneak round to photograph and measure up when I knew she was out."
After noting where the sun shone at different times of day, Sarah decided to divide the garden into four corresponding areas. "The centre is sunny at lunchtime so I made this into the lunchtime patio, the top left corner catches the evening sun so I made this into a raised barbecue area. The area in front of the back door has the morning sun so that's the lazy Sunday morning patio. The top right is a little shadier, and so I put a water feature in there.

Judges' comment:
A garden for everybody! It is skilfully designed to take into account the plants and trees, cooking areas and lighting, as well as the people who will use it. The garden has the capacity and versatility to transform itself from a relaxing haven to a dinner venue with little or no effort - all in 40 square metres.

"I didn't want to do anything too contrived. I love plants and I like to go round the garden and see what's come out each day." Julia chose a Marshalls Heritage Circle for her seating area as she prefers curves to straight lines. She's used Marshalls Heritage Stepping Stones through the planting. "It's lovely to walk through plants, like a mystery trail - I know my children will enjoy it too," she says. Julia likes the way gardening effortlessly crosses generations. "My dad is 83 and is still a keen gardener, my late mother was too. Dad will come and help me with the planting - I've already started borrowing plants and cuttings from him." Judges' comment: The winning Gardener's Garden is packed with activity, colour and fragrance. This garden will bloom and blossom throughout the seasons for friends and family to enjoy. And the hard landscaping is sympathetic to the overall look of the theme.
Julia's landscaping wish list
Patio: the Heritage range, reminiscent of newly-quarried stone, features in Julia's design. A Heritage Circle two-ring feature kit creates a focal point and a series of Heritage Steps and Stepping Stones, all in Calder Brown, lead to the top of the garden and integrate seamlessly. Seat for two with integral table. Other items: Argent Aqua water feature, three tall frames for climbing plants, classical statue, woodchips to minimise work needed in planted areas, pots for herbs. Runner-up Samantha GreenhillThe Exotic Garden "I love exotic plants and warm spicy colours and I wanted my design to bring a splash of colour to my friend Jane's garden in Blackpool," says Samantha Greenhill of Marton, Blackpool. "The planting - palms and big architectural specimens - will make visitors feel cocooned. But using mirrors and reflective surfaces will also suggest there's more to the garden than meets the eye." Samantha thought about decking but was worried it might be slippery in shade. "Then I discovered Marshalls Woodstone Decking, which is ideal," she says. Her design uses Marshalls Natural Slate Tiles to clad the courtyard's back wall. "Used like this rather than flat you can appreciate the beautiful colours, especially with the light shining on them," she adds. Exotic cannas and lilies add the finishing touch.
Judges' comment: This transformed a seemingly bleak courtyard into a tropical paradise. The simple use of hard landscaping is perfect, creating a rich, authentic look without making it overcrowded. Lighting installed underfoot, a hanging chair and an outdoor heater enable this garden to be enjoyed day and night.
Samantha's landscaping wish list Rear wall: tiled with Natural Slate Tiles in a Burnt Copper colour for a fantastic aesthetic appeal. Gravel to fill and hardcore to cover.
Patio areas: for a trouble-free patio, Woodstone Diagonal Decking in Light Buff was selected as a hardwearing alternative to wood. Areas stepped to create differing heights. Blue neon lights in deck steps, spotlights hidden among plants. Patio heater. Water feature using Natural Slate Tiles.
Flower beds: several at deck height, others raised with brick. Three arches for climbing plants. Hidden irrigation system. Pots, hanging basket. Runner-up Christina Melaugh The Wildlife Garden Bringing in logs for the woodburner, Christina Melaugh was always brushing off insect life, so she knew how important decaying wood is to a wildlife garden. "My design uses logs more artistically and they'll be left in place too," says Christine, of Barton in the Beans, Nuneaton, Warwickshire. Her overgrown laurel attracts insects and so bats, and her plan includes a bat box. "I researched plants that attract wildlife and was amazed how many insect species live on a silver birch," she adds. Her garden was lacking a water feature - vital for wildlife - but the Marshalls Millstone fits perfectly with her circular design, which also helps her make far better use of the garden. "Before I'd often be making a quick dash to the vegetable plot and back. Now I'll be forced to make a 'journey' and see far more on the way." Judges' comment: The close attention to detail is very impressive - the flowers, shrubs, bushes, old logs, lacewing hibernating boxes and bat boxes - and puts Christina's entry head and shoulders above the rest. Christina's landscaping wish list
Hard landscaping materials: the design is concentrated on two interlinked, two-ring Heritage Circles in Old Yorkstone. These are linked by a pathway of Traditional colour Tegula Cobbles. These lead to benches at either end of the garden which are created from Old Mill Brick for the pillars and Woodstone Sleepers for the seat and coping. A Millstone water feature is central to the wildlife theme. Woven coir roosting pockets are housed in the hedge and a number of old logs are strategically placed to attract insects. Gardening

The 34 year-old has a rare condition known as uterus didelphys, which means she has two uteruses. Mrs Cromar, from Murray, near Salt Lake City, Utah, has been told she is due to have a boy and a girl. They are not twins and are due at different times. Medical experts say the chance of conceiving in both uteruses is about one in five million. Less than 100 people in the world are known to have "double pregnancies". At her first ultrasound doctors told the delivery and labour nurse that one baby was five weeks and a day old and the other six weeks and a day. Mrs Cromar, who with husband Joel, 33, already have three children aged under eight, said she knew she had the rare uterine condition but it had not affected her other pregnancies. But she admitted she was nervous, but very excited, at the prospect of the double birth next year. Doctors have warned her, the condition carried a risk of premature labour and low birth weight. "I'm a little nervous, just because I know what can happen, but I'm really excited," she told her local television station. "It's pretty rare. We are pretty thankful, pretty happy. “Joel didn't believe me for a little while, though.” Steve Terry, her doctor, said he was surprised when the ultrasound first revealed the double pregnancy. "Angie and I both had the look of surprise," he said. He said the there were less than 100 women worldwide who have reportedly had the same condition. "She is in a small club," he said. Mrs Cromar, a nurse in the maternity unit at one of her local hospitals, has been told the babies, who are now at more than 20 weeks, are developing normally. They will join her other children, Alex, eight, Luke, four and Sammy, two. Health News

We can protect our Forces and our nation
Part of our obligation to our Forces is to ensure our country creates not just brilliant soldiers but great citizens. As another 5,000 soldiers lose their jobs we should all consider the support they receive, says shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy.

6:00AM BST 25 Jun 2013
Labour will this week propose a new twin-track approach to our service personnel’s development: enhancing employment support on departure from the Forces matched by more rigorous in-service training. This would give service-leavers the skills and structures to help them advance in new careers but also strengthen military operations by increasing skill levels whilst serving. Being in the Forces often provides individuals with friendship if not near-familial support. Leaving can be disorientating and disconcerting. Transition to civilian life encompasses issues from finding a home to retraining - 60% of leavers from non-officer ranks last year were between the ages of 20 and 34. Existing support to find work, introduced by the previous Government, is good but can be improved. MoD provision is directed at those with long service histories. Early leavers, those with under four years' service and often the most potentially vulnerable, get very limited attention. Labour is calling for resettlement support to be extended by linking provision to need as well as length of service. It is right, too, that former members of the Forces have ‘day one’ access to the Work Programme, and we want to see brilliant but fragmented third sector provision brought together under a permanent umbrella body.

Hard times for soldiers
18 Jun 2013
Military experience gives individuals organisational, team-building and leadership skills. The Government must take a lead in educating employers on the potential value to their bottom line of employing those who have served on the frontline. All sections of society have a stake in delivering support for veterans, which is why it is significant that Community trade union are today announcing their intention to become the UK’s Veterans Union, providing specialised support to veterans seeking work. Alongside enhanced post-service support, far greater effort must be placed on equipping our Forces with higher skills. At present, the only academic training the services are mandated to deliver is Level 1 in literacy and numeracy - equivalent to achieving GCSE grades D to G - within 3 years, and Level 2 - equivalent to achieving GCSE grades A* to C - within 8 years. Those without qualifications are a minority – but there are too many, particularly in the Army. 50% of recruits have literacy and numeracy skills equivalent to those of an average 11 or 7 year old. In 2012 there were 1,464 with Level 1 numeracy and 4,089 with Level 1 literacy at their initial Army assessments. Can we really defend a system where many of those who defend our country are left without additional basic skills? This is bad for recruits, the Army and our country. The British Army cannot be braver, but more could be done to make it as smart as it can possibly be. By being more ambitious for the skills of personnel, the Army can be more effective at its vital job of protecting the nation. Labour wants more new army joiners to be able to gain A*-C grade GCSE equivalent qualifications within two years, and we would examine how the MoD and DfE could work together to deliver faster educational attainment. As we raise the mandatory education participation age to 18 those who join the military early can't be left behind. This must be part of a wider programme of reform, with greater access to Army apprenticeships and easier conversion between military and civilian qualifications so that military medics, for example, can serve in our hospitals. Higher-skilled British Armed Forces would have greater ability to perform to their maximum on operations, increased chance of progression within their Service and re-entry to civilian life would be an experience more defined by opportunity than compromise. This goes to the heart of the nature of the Services we want. If our Forces are going to be leaner, they can also be smarter. Adaptable forces, with new focuses, for example on cultural embedding in at-risk nations or partnering with a wider range of allies, will require higher skill levels, whether intelligence-gathering, operating high-end equipment or linguistics. Education should be seen as a key capability, with a new culture of constant development which spreads across all ranks. We should review how higher academic attainment can be spread throughout the ranks, including lessons from the United States' officer class. The costs of any of Labour's changes would come from efficiencies within existing budgets, including means-testing the x-factor pay rate so that at a time when defence spending is pressed we redistribute from the top better develop of new recruits, cutting consultancy spend and reducing the warehouse inventory. The first duty of any Government is of course to protect their borders, their people and their interests. Inherent within that duty must be an obligation to protect those who defend their nation. Our service personnel are exceptional; so too must be the support they receive. Labour

Barack Obama to nominate John Kerry as Secretary of State
Barack Obama will nominate John Kerry to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, US officials have said. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. John Kerry Photo: AP	By Chris Irvine
3:34PM GMT 21 Dec 2012
Follow The White House is expected to nominate Mr Kerry, who has a wealth of foreign policy experience, this afternoon. Mr Kerry, who ran against George W Bush for president in 2004, emerged as the favourite for America's top diplomatic role after Susan Rice, the US's UN ambassador, withdrew her nomination. Mrs Clinton, who has been tipped to mount a bid for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 2016, will step down at the beginning of the year. Mr Kerry, a patrician figure with long experience of foreign affairs, is often said to have been unfortunate to be passed over for the Secretary of State's job in 2008, after he had come out very early in support of Mr Obama's presidential campaign. The Massachusetts senator, however, has remained a key ally in the Senate and delivered a fiery speech at this year's Democratic National Convention, as well as standing in for the Republican candidate Mitt Romney during Mr Obama's presidential debate practice.
