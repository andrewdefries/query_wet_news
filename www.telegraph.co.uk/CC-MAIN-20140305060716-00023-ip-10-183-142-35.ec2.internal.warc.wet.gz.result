Pictured: the 'real site' of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon
A British academic believes she has identified the precise spot of the elusive Hanging Gardens of Babylon - in one of the most dangerous places on earth
Ancient texts tmay have revealled what could be the site of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon Photo: ALAMY	By Jasper Copping

It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World for which the location has for centuries remained elusive. Now, though, an academic from Oxford University believes she has solved one of the world’s last great archaeological mysteries by identifying the precise spot on which the Hanging Gardens of Babylon once stood. Dr Stephanie Dalley focused her search hundreds of miles north of the site of the ancient city of Babylon, now near Hillah, in central Iraq, to support her theory that the lush, elevated marvel was in fact built near the city of Ninevah, in the north of the country. The believed site of the Hanging Garden of Babylon, in the foregound, on a mound near the ancient city of Ninevah, northern Iraq (CHANNEL FOUR)
From piecing together clues from ancient texts, the academic has uncovered evidence that the gardens were in fact produced not by the Babylonians and their king Nebuchadnezzar, as has traditionally been assumed, but rather by their neighbours and foes, the Assyrians under their monarch, Sennacherib, around 2,700 years ago.

Sennacherib’s capital, Ninevah, is now near to Mosul, an area of Iraq still wracked by religious and ethnic violence, and although Dr Dalley travelled to the region earlier in the autumn, her team considered it too dangerous to visit the exact spot. However, using maps, she was able to direct a local film crew, with an armed escort, to the area, next to the ruins of the king’s palace, to survey it on her behalf. Their footage showed a heavily a vast mound of dirt and rubble, which slopes down to an area of greenery and looks out onto modern housing and open countryside beyond. Dr Dalley said: “That’s the best place for it to be. It looks like a good place for a garden. “More research is now required at the site, but sadly I don’t think that will be gpossible in my lifetime. “My conviction that the gardens were in Ninevah remains unshaken.”
The footage is the culmination of more than 20 years of research by Dr Dalley, from Oxford University’s Oriental Institute, to prove the correct location of the gardens. With no archaeological evidence ever found for them, many have dismissed the gardens as a myth. Knowledge of them is based on a few accounts, written hundreds of years after it was said to have been built by people who never saw it. One of these accounts claims that it was created by King Nebuchadnezzar, 600 years before the birth of Christ, at Babylon as a paradise in the desert for his wife who missed the green mountains of her home. However, in the writings of the time - including Nebuchadnezzar’s own texts - there is not one single mention of any garden and more than a century of digging has turned up nothing. Dr Dalley directed her own research further north after decoding an ancient “cuneiform” text - a script from the Babylonian and Assyrian Empires - that led her to believe the gardens had been attributed to the wrong location, the wrong man and wrong period. The researcher - one of a handful of people in the world who can read cuneiform - came across a prism at the British Museum with cuneiform text which describes the life of Sennacherib; who lived 100 years before Nebuchadnezzar and reigned over an empire stretching from southern Turkey to modern day Israel, which describes a palace that he built and a garden that he built alongside calling them a “Wonder for all people”. Further support for the theory comes from a bas-relief, removed from Nineveh and brought to the British Museum, showing his palace complex and a garden featuring trees hanging in the air on terraces and plants suspended on arches. Because Ninevah is so far from Babylon, this evidence has previously been overlooked. However, Dr Dalley has found that the Assyrians conquered Babylon and their capital became known as “New Babylon”, possibly accounting for the confusion over the names. Her research, which features in a Channel 4 documentary tonight, Finding Babylon’s Hanging Garden, has led her to establish that the gardens were built in a series of terraces, buit up like an amphitheatre, with a lake at the bottom. Water was bought to the city and surrounding areas via a 60 mile long canal. Evidence of this structure, 300ft wide and 60ft deep at some points, remains on the landscape and can be seen on now de-classified photographs taken by US spy satellites and analysed by Dr Dalley. The greenery would have required around 300 tonnes of water a day. An inscription found by the academic describes how this was achieved, with water from the lake was raised up onto the terraces by device using the same principles as the Archimedes’ screw - some four centuries before it was thought to have been invented. Ninevah features in the Old Testament as the city to which Jonah was sent by God to preach against its sinfulness. The list of wonders was originally drawn up, however, as a guide to “must—see” sights for ancient Greek travellers in the eastern Mediterranean around the third century BC. Most were destroyed by earthquakes and only the Pyramid of Giza survives. Archaeology

Mortgage rates only need rise '0.69pc' to make renting cheaper
Interest rates are rising in America but falling in Britain, giving another boost to house prices, expains Andrew Oxlade. Interest rates are rising in America but falling in Britain, giving another boost to house prices

Mortgage rates would have to rise to 10.5pc before it became more expensive to buy than rent. That was the finding of a study by Forbes magazine, which analysed America’s property market and included all considerations such as deposit, insurance and the running costs of owning a home. It assumes you live in your home for seven years and concludes that buying 41pc is cheaper than renting. It’s a different story in the great coastal conurbations. In San Francisco, loan rates would only need to rise to 5.4pc, not a million miles away from the typical 3.9pc that Americans pay. In New York the figure is 6.8pc. The math, as they say, is simplified in that most borrowers take 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. In Britain, such advanced calculations have not been made. Zoopla, a property listings website, regularly crunches the numbers in a more basic way, comparing the cost of renting with the cost of servicing a mortgage. Related Articles

Its use of an interest-only mortgage for the sums, and based on a pricey 5pc mortgage rate, attracts criticism but Zoopla says using a repayment mortgage, where the debt is being paid down each month, would be misleading. Tenants who want to be buyers, the company says, would also put money aside for a deposit. Its latest index found that tenants in the UK paid 14pc more than buyers. But it depends on where you live. It is cheaper for house buyers in 86pc of Britain’s cities, with the greatest disparity in Milton Keynes or Peterborough. At the other end of the spectrum it pays to rent if you live in Swansea, Bournemouth or Edinburgh. On the issue of how far rates would need to rise to turn the balance nationally, I asked Zoopla to crunch the numbers. It tells a very different story from the situation in America. Its estimate is that the average mortgage rates paid by Britons would have to rise only by 0.69 points to 5.69pc, taking the cost up by £80 to £668 a month, to match the cost of renting. Fortunately for home buyers, mortgage rates here are falling, unlike across the pond, where the average 30-year fixed rate is up from 3.4pc to 3.9pc in the past month. This is because mortgage rates are linked to the income yield on the bonds issued by the US Treasury to raise money, rather than any rate set by the central bank. This yield has risen because bond prices have fallen on the hope of an economic recovery and because of the prospect of an end to rife money printing. But in Britain mortgage rates have entirely shrugged off rises in the yield on our government bonds or gilts. Normally it exerts a heavy influence on how lenders price a deal. But the Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme, which has offered up loans with rates as low as 0.25pc to banks and building societies, has had huge success in pushing down the cost of borrowing. Several of the country’s most senior bankers have admitted to me that they had failed to grasp how much impact it would have. The average five-year fixed rate is now below 4pc for the first time and the best two-year deals are closing in on the 1.5pc level. Even the best buy-to-let rates are now exceptionally low, falling to 2.5pc this week. Of course, when rates fall, demand and prices rise. This has been most noticeable in the capital, where prices have become astonishingly high. Official data published this week showed that house prices in London had risen by an incredible 46pc since the market bottomed out in 2009. For young buyers, the chances of getting on the property ladder look ever more remote. Shelter warned this week that, because prices had risen so far, single buyers in London would need to save for 30 years to find the average deposit of £55,680. Across England, the average required deposit of £27,980 would take 12 years to save up. But it can be done with help from the Bank of Mum and Dad (or Grandad). Investment firm AJ Bell calculated for me that if parents or grandparents began saving £40 a month for a newborn, the £27,000 deposit would be achieved by their 30th birthday, based on annual charges of 1pc and a modest annual return of 5pc. For buyers today it could all end in disaster – buying when the market is propped artificially high. But it’s safe to assume the next generation will have the same hunger to get on the ladder regardless of whether it’s cheaper to rent or buy. Mortgages

Urban kitchen gardens: fine food in small places
You can enjoy your own ingredients from your own urban plot, whatever your space restrictions. Image 1 of 2	Being green when space is lean: in his new book 'The Urban Kitchen Gardener’, Tom Moggach provides ingenious growing tips for the city gardener and give details on how to make use of salvage items, such as turning an old bath into a pond Photo: LAURA HYND	Image 1 of 2	Tom Moggach, author of The Urban Kitchen Gardener Photo: LAURA HYND	By Francine Raymond
2:41PM BST 01 May 2012
Not all gardeners have rolling acres to indulge their passion, and most of us will spend at least part of our lives trapped in small spaces. But all is not lost. Even the tiniest plot can provide ingredients for the cunning cook. “Growing food is different in the city. Life is faster and space is tight. We’re spoilt for choice, with lots to juggle. So we garden to bring balance and natural joy to our lives, raising plants that offer us terrific ingredients to eat.”
This is Tom Moggach’s introduction to his new book, The Urban Kitchen Gardener, where he shares his advice for successful growing in typical city plots: on window sills, patios, balconies and yards, where warm urban microclimate counterbalances the effects of low light levels and constricted space. Tom imparts knowledge and enthusiasm with ease. He feels gardening and cooking provide the extra bits of magic that can enrich all our lives, no matter how hard pressed we are for time. A horticultural evangelist, he spreads the word through his journalism and teaching (he is a trained teacher), and through his company, City Leaf, as a trainer for hire to schools and councils. Recently, he has designed a certified course for special needs students in Islington, helping them qualify for placements in the trade. The Moggachs are a family of writers. His mother is the novelist and screenwriter Deborah Moggach, whose latest hit is The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, adapted from her book These Foolish Things. She is also a passionate gardener (the premiere’s post-party goody bag included a tube of anti-ageing cream, some Hobnob biscuits, and a packet of marigold seeds). Tom says she plants a bed or cooks a meal with equal panache, an invaluable blessing to pass on to any son or daughter. Related Articles

Like most of us, Tom loved growing stuff when he was tiny, but remembers the “uncool” stigma during his early teens. Later, though, like many young people, it was his love of cooking that encouraged him to grow ingredients; he wanted to have the freshest food at his fingertips, despite a busy city lifestyle. The constraints of space, light and free time meant that difficult choices had to be made, but the lack of acreage concentrated his mind. In his book, Tom presents recipes that are light, modern and inventive, using home-grown ingredients augmented with edible flowers, home-laid eggs, and his own city garden honey. Ingredients are fashionable but appropriate: beetroot, chillies, squash, mouse melons, radishes and peas, as well as herbs (shiso, sorrel and lemon verbena) and fruit (currants and gooseberries). The recipes include a delicious basil and lime ice cream. 25g sweet basil leaves and 150g caster sugar are blitzed in a blender, then mixed with 200g mascarpone and 400g full-fat yogurt, as well as the zest of half a lime. Each ingredient is introduced with recommended varieties and inherent pest warnings. This is followed by growing, harvesting and preserving instructions, then ingenious suggestions for use, such as six ways to use mustard seeds, five ways to use currants, and six ways to use verbena – why not add the leaves to a chocolate ganache, or to a finger bowl of warm water when scoffing messy food? Sections on how to be green in a small space are indispensable. Tom has ideas for how to make a pond in a salvaged bath tub, how to vermicompost and save water, and how to make use of inventive containers. His blue tray system for a steady supply of herbs and microgreens is feasible in the tiniest of back yards. Pot culture is exploited to the full, and advice on the suitability for container growing is included with each ingredient, plus information on which bit to eat and how much sunlight each plant needs. The benefits of edible growing for the city gardener come in spadefuls. Urban veg prices are high while true freshness is rare, and relaxation in the open air is the perfect antidote to city life. Much of the advice, however, can be adapted to container culture in any garden, and makes my large plot seem under-productive and wasteful by comparison.

- Understand your growing space – its sunny spots, dark corners and draughty bits. - Work out which bits get the most sun – use these areas for sun-loving crops. - Expand growing space with extra levels and shelves, grow vertically as well. - Windowsills offer warmth and protection for seedlings and tender plants. - Don’t worry about pollution if you are more than 3m (10ft) away from a main road. - If wind is an issue, create windbreaks using screening and trellises. - Patrol daily: weeding, checking water and harvesting.

Buy-to-let market: invest your time before your money
Five years on from crisis, the economy is showing some strong signs of recovery – but we're not out of the woods yet. Newcomers to the property market will do well to check the vital stats before jumping in.
1:25PM BST 07 Oct 2013
Many buy-to-let investors invest to help provide a pension. Those who invested in the Nineties and early 2000s have mostly created a great pension pot from a mix of income and capital growth. Property returns since the credit crunch haven’t performed as well. One of the main things you need from buy-to-let to provide a pension is for property prices and rents to increase at least in line with inflation. Sadly most areas across the UK haven’t achieved this recently, so in real terms, earnings from property have fallen. If you decide to invest in buy-to-let later in life, speak to an independent financial adviser to check it will be a good addition to your existing income and assets. Be clear whether you want capital growth or income from property, and on the pros and cons of investing with cash versus borrowing. Understand the real risks and rewards from property investment, checking the best way to legally own buy-to-let properties and understand what effect the additional rental income and potential capital growth will have on your tax position.

10 worst mistakes made by amateur property developers From cheap wood flooring to lavish marble bathrooms, we list the errors made by amateur property pundits as they attempt to turn a quick profit
Interiors overload: don't overdecorate a house - many buyers prefer something clean and simple-looking Photo: Alamy	By Anna Tyzack

We’re all tempted by the idea of buying a house, doing it up and selling it for a huge profit. Sadly it’s not as easy as it appears. According to Lochie Rankin of home finding agency Lichfields, property renovation is fraught with traps and even in a rising market you can lose large sums of money. “As an amateur it can be very easy to underestimate the cost of the build and the time it will take to complete,” he says. This is a mistake I've made myself: a supposed four-month build took 18 months to finish. I asked a panel of property experts to outline the worst mistakes made by amateur developers, and how they can be avoided. Buying in the wrong area
This is one of the most basic errors wannabe developers make, according to property consultant Simon Barnes . “They believe it will be the next up-and-coming area but if it’s not a nice place to live, why will anyone want to spend a fortune buying there?” Houses on or off busy main roads and those in areas with poor transport links, for example, are always going to sell for a discount. Most amateur developers think it’s easier to find an opportunity than it actually is, adds Philip Harvey, of buying advisors Property Vision. “They’re in competition with professionals who spend 100 per cent of their time hunting for profitable projects.”

Don’t be tempted to borrow more than you can afford, no matter how much money you think you’re going to make, warns Alan Waxman, of property developers Landmass. Always shop around for the best possible deal and be realistic about how much the whole renovation project is going to cost you and the time it is going to take (see below). Getting fleeced by the builder
Your renovation project is only as good as your builder – so scope out their work first and get references from past clients. Before giving them the go ahead, make sure they've signed a fixed price contract – without this it is easy to get ripped off if the build continues for longer than expected, says Rankin. Scrimping on quality
Yes, there are cheaper, faux versions of all the handmade tiles, oak floors and composite work surfaces used in the most expensive developments, but they are to be avoided. As tempting it is to buy the cheapest of everything, potential buyers will notice immediately if you cut corners. “Copying other developers but at a lower standard just isn’t acceptable,” Barnes says. Even if your budget is small, choose appliances, fixtures and fittings because you know they will last, not because they resemble something more expensive. And don’t scrimp on the exterior – the majority of buyers will decide if they want the property before they’ve stepped through the front door. Going overboard
It’s equally unforgiveable to over-design and specify. According to Rankin, buyers often get put off by lavish marble bathrooms with crystal taps and silk carpets. Keep your feet on the ground and go for a clean, fresh finish rather than anything too fancy. Getting too personal
Inflicting your taste on a project alienates buyers. “Neutral does not mean boring,” Waxman says. I’ve definitely fallen into this trap – I wonder how many buyers will appreciate my deep blue bedroom? Aim to keep rooms as bright and light as possible, giving buyers a blank canvas on which to project their own ideas. Cramming a house with bedrooms
Contrary to what many amateur developers think, more bedrooms don’t necessarily make for a more valuable house. According to Waxman, buyers want quality space rather than cramped living conditions – bedroom wardrobes and dressing areas should be prioritized over irrelevant box rooms. First-time developers should focus on the layout of their project, ensuring that the rooms flow together and there is a balance of entertaining space, living space and bedrooms. “If the space planning is poor even having a high-quality finish will not help you sell,” says Waxman. Rushing in
So keen are amateurs to make a quick buck that they often start work without proper plans ­ ­– or planning permission, according to Rankin. “They have totally unrealistic timescales and costing programs,” he says. The more you plan, the more cost and time efficient the project, adds Waxman. “Make sure you have all the necessary paperwork before you start work. You don’t want there to be any problems when you come to sell.”
Greed
You might think your house is a million times better than when you bought it but this doesn’t necessarily mean it’s worth a million times more. Greed is a major stumbling block for achieving a good sale, explains Rankin. “If your house is on the market for too much money it will sit there and go stale in today’s market,” he says. “Buyers are too savvy these days and have a good idea of how much they want to be spending.” It’s a good idea to get a property valued by at least three estate agents – and ignore the one who comes up with the highest asking price. They’re probably just trying to win the instruction." Fluffing the sale
Your bank manager might be breathing down your neck but it’s a bad idea to launch your house on the market outside the optimal selling seasons of spring and autumn. “In winter everyone is busy with Christmas and in summer they’re on holiday. You’ve got to time it right,” says Rankin. Property Advice

Neil Armstrong, US astronaut, dies aged 82
Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, has died aged 82.
By Adam Lusher
8:16PM BST 25 Aug 2012
Comments
Armstrong underwent a heart-bypass surgery earlier this month to relieve blocked coronary arteries. As commander of the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the moon, hours after Apollo's Eagle lunar module had touched down on July 20 1969. He radioed back to Earth the historic statement: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." He then spent nearly three hours walking on the moon with fellow astronaut Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin. Mr Armstrong in Washington last year Related Articles

Praising Armstrong as a "reluctant American hero," his family said in a statement on Saturday that he had "served his nation proudly, as a navy fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut."
“Neil was our loving husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend. “Neil Armstrong was also a reluctant American hero who always believed he was just doing his job. He served his Nation proudly, as a navy fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut."
The British astronomer Sir Patrick Moore said: "As the first man on the moon, he broke all records. He was a man who had all the courage in the world."
Astronaut Neil Armstrong dies, aged 82
Charles Bolden, the NASA administrator, said: "As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own. We mourn the passing of a friend, fellow astronaut and true American hero."
Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Richard Nixon, and in 1978 he received the the Congressional Space Medal of Honour from President Jimmy Carter. Last November Armstrong, along with three other astronauts, received the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest US civilian award. A statement from his family issued on Saturday night said he died following complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures. Armstrong was born in Wapakoneta, Ohio, on August 5, 1930. On July 20, 1936, when he was 6, he experienced his first airplane flight in Warren, Ohio, when he and his father Stephen, an auditor for the Ohio state government, took a ride in a Ford Trimotor, a three-engined transport plane that was also known as the "Tin Goose". After serving as a naval pilot from 1949 to 1952, and serving in the Korean War, Armstrong joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) – the precursor to NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration - in 1955. As a research pilot at NASA's Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif., he was a project pilot on many pioneering high speed aircraft, including the well known, 4000-mph X-15. Neil Armstrong was the first person to set foot upon the Moon Photo: REUTERS Armstrong joined the NASA astronaut corps in 1962. He was assigned as command pilot for the Gemini 8 mission. Gemini 8 was launched on March 16, 1966, and Armstrong performed the first successful manned docking of two vehicles in space. His second and last spaceflight was as mission commander for the Apollo II moon landing. After commanding the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong subsequently held the position of Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. In this position, he was responsible for the coordination and management of overall NASA research and technology work related to aeronautics. He was Professor of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Cincinnati between 1971-1979. Armstrong and his wife, Carol, married in 1999, made their home in the Cincinnati suburb of Indian Hill, but he had largely stayed out of public view in recent years. He spoke at Ohio State University during a February event honouring fellow astronaut John Glenn and the 50th anniversary of Glenn becoming the first American to orbit the Earth. In May, Armstrong joined Gene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon, at Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida to support the opening of The National Flight Academy, which aims to teach maths and science to kids through an aviation-oriented camp.
