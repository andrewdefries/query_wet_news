One in five women stays childless because of modern lifestyle Almost one in five women are remaining childless, as rising numbers choose careers over childbirth, a study shows. By Tom Whitehead, Home Affairs Editor 3:53PM BST 25 Jun 2009
The proportion of those who are without children has almost doubled since the 1990s - and pursuing professional careers is a key factor, suggesting it is now a lifestyle choice.
Single women are five times less likely to have children than married ones, while those cohabiting are almost twice as likely to stay childless, the Office for National Statistics research reveals.
It comes as separate figures show one in ten adults now cohabit, with numbers expected to rise by two thirds to almost 7.5 million by 2031, while marriages will fall.
Women who are better educated, come from a higher social class or had no siblings are also less likely to reproduce, as is a woman who has higher qualifications than her partner.
The causes present a significant change in reasons for childlessness as it is now increasing among sexually-active, healthy females living with partners - suggesting it is a deliberate choice.
In previous generations, the main reasons for women not having children were poverty, poor nutrition and low marriage rates, the research found.
The ONS study, the largest of its kind carried out, said: "The data shows that lack of a co-resident partner still appears to be one of the main factors associated with childlessness."
But it stressed that socio-economic factors also played a significant role. Some 42 per cent of childless women in the study were in professional or managerial occupations compared to only 30 per cent of mothers.
Women in such occupations were almost four times less likely to have children than someone in an unskilled job.
"Irrespective of their partnership status, women's own socio-economic characteristics, including economic activity and social class, are significantly associated with childlessness," the study said.
Anastasia de Waal, director of family and education for the think-tank Civitas, said: "These women are marrying their careers, and not marrying and having children. "It used to be one of the most important boxes to tick was getting married and having kids but for a significant proportion of women that is changing.
"The question it raises is: are we going to see a polarisation between the poor having children and the rich not? We have not got the balance right between wanting children in our society and wanting to work."
The survey examined more than 12,700 women born between 1956 and 1960 throughout their childbearing years to their mid-40s.
It found some 17 per cent were childless, although that figure rose to 19 per cent for those born in 1960. A similar study carried out on women born in 1945 found only 10 per cent remained childless.
Of the women in the survey, more than a quarter of childless women were qualified to degree level or higher compared with 19 per cent of mothers while 15 per cent had no siblings compared to 11 per cent of mothers.
Almost 13 per cent of those without children were better educated than their partners compared to only eight per cent of mothers.
:: The proportion of cohabiting adults in England and Wales has almost doubled in 15 years, with 4.5 million choosing to live together and not get married, separate ONS figures show.
The figure, based on the picture in 2007, accounted for one in ten adults and was up from six per cent in 1992.
Projections by the ONS suggest the number will rise to 7.4 million by 2031, or the equivalent of 3.7 million cohabiting couples. That is a principal projection and a higher estimate suggests it could be as great as 4.4 million couples.
At the same time the proportion of adults marrying is expected to fall to 43 per cent by 2031, down from the current 49 per cent.
:: Foreign born mothers have accounted for two thirds of the growth in births in the UK since 2001 and now make up more than one in five new births.
There were 66,731 more births to foreign-born mothers in 2007 than in 2001, while children to UK-born mothers only rose by 36,391 over the period, the ONS statistics show.
The study said immigration has been a key driver in the growth of the population but stressed an increasing fertility rate among UK-born mothers is also having an effect. UK News

Indian diplomat at centre of row with US indicted
Diplomat Devyani Khobragade, arrested over alleged visa fraud, formally indicted then asked to leave US as India places national pride and 'defining partnership of the 21st century' at stake in argument with Washington

3:30AM GMT 10 Jan 2014
Follow Devyani Khobragade, an Indian envoy indicted by a US grand jury on two counts of visa fraud and making false statements, left the United States late on Thursday night as part of an agreement intended to ease a diplomatic crisis between the two countries. Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, said there would be no need to arraign her before a court due to her absence. The US earlier agreed to Indian requests to switch the accreditation of Ms Khobragade, the deputy-consul general in New York, to the United Nations to give her greater immunity. The relationship between the countries, which have been strategic allies since 2006, has deteriorated to recrimination since the arrest last month of Ms Khobragade, who was handcuffed and strip-searched after being accused of visa fraud and paying her servant below the minimum wage. It came hours after the Indian government said that it would order the closure of a US embassy social club next week in retaliation for the arrest. Related Articles

It was alleged that she had made a false declaration that she was paying her Indian domestic servant a salary of $4,500 (£2,730) despite signing a contract to pay her $573 a month (£347 a month, or £4,164 a year). Her treatment was seen as a national humiliation by Indian political leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, the Congress leader, and Narendra Modi, the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, who cancelled planned meetings with US Congressmen after the diplomat spoke of her distress. “I broke down many times as the indignities of repeated handcuffing, stripping and cavity searches, swabbing, in a hold-up with common criminals and drug addicts were all being imposed upon me despite my incessant assertions of [diplomatic] immunity,” she wrote in a letter. India claimed the “rough” treatment was in breach of the Vienna Convention. It moved quickly after the dispute emerged last month to remove security barriers outside the U.S embassy in Delhi, and withdraw diplomatic identity cards and tax concessions for American diplomats’ personal imports. Indian commentators called for inquiries into the tax status of teachers at American schools in India while others called for the visas given to partners of gay diplomats to be rescinded because homosexuality is illegal in India. Indian officials said they would withdraw those privileges which were not extended reciprocally to Indian diplomats in the United States. Now India is set to hit the heart of Delhi’s large American community — its embassy-based social club, where U.S nationals, foreign diplomats and other expatriates enjoy its open air pool, rooftop bar, bowling alley and gym. They have set a deadline of January 16th for the popular club to close down because, it says, its facilities, which should only be for its own diplomats, have been extended to others in breach of the Vienna Convention. “By extending these facilities to non-diplomats and not filing tax returns on commercial activities, there is a violation of the Vienna Convention,” said one Indian source. The row has already taken a toll on a relationship President Obama had predicted would become the “defining partnership of the 21st century” during his visit to New Delhi in 2010. A planned visit by the US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz which both countries had hoped would speed power generation deals between the two countries has been cancelled. “It has impacted relations. The Americans realize both the gravity and the interest — it has struck a chord in India. If this continues down that line it could affect [relations] very adversely,” one senior official told the Telegraph. India

David Cameron must return Falklands to Argentina, Cristina Kirchner demands in open letter
David Cameron must return the Falkland Islands to Argentina, 180 years after the territories were “forcibly stripped” from the South American country, the country’s president has claimed in newspaper adverts. In an emotional open letter to the British prime minister, Cristina Kirchner, Argentina’s president, has called on him to honour a United Nations resolution dating from 1965 and start negotiations about handing over the islands.

In an emotional open letter to the British prime minister, Cristina Kirchner, Argentina’s president, has called on him to honour a United Nations resolution dating from 1965 and start negotiations about handing over the islands. The letter, which was due to be published in the British national newspaper The Guardian on Thursday, is timed to mark the anniversary of when on January 3 1833, Britain took control of the islands from the Argentinians. The 212-word letter, copied to Ban Ki-moon, the secretary-general of the United Nations, repeatedly refers to the Falklands as the Malvinas, the Argentine Government’s Spanish name for the islands. It says: “One hundred and eighty years ago on this same date, January 3rd, in a blatant exercises of 19th century colonialism, Argentina was forcibly stripped of the Malvinas Islands, which are situated 14,000 km (8,700 miles) away from London. “The Argentines on the Islands were expelled by the Royal Navy and the United Kingdom subsequently began a population implantation process similar to that applied to other territories under colonial rule.

“Since then, Britain, the colonial power, has refused to return the territories to the Argentine Republic, thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity. “The question of the Malvinas is also a cause embraced by Latin America and by vast majority of peoples and governments around the world that reject colonialism. “In 1960, the United Nations proclaimed the necessity of ‘bringing to an end colonialism in all its forms and manifestations’. “In 1965, the General Assembly adopted, with no votes against (not even by the United Kingdom), a resolution considered the Malvinas Islands a colonial case and inviting the two countries to negotiate a solution to the sovereignty dispute between them. “This was followed by many other resolutions to that effect. In the name of the Argentine people, I reiterate our invitation for us to abide by the resolutions of the United Nations.”
The 3000-strong population of the Falklands are overwhelmingly pro-British. The islanders are due to be asked if they want to continue to be an overseas territory of the United Kingdom at a referendum in March this year. Mr Cameron has said the UK would “respect and defend” the result of the plebiscite. Dr Barry Elsby, Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands, told The Daily Telegraph on Wednesday night: "We are not a colony – our relationship with the United Kingdom is by choice. "Unlike the Government of Argentina, the United Kingdom respects the right of our people to determine our own affairs, a right that is enshrined in the UN Charter and which is ignored by Argentina." Last night the Foreign Office said that it “strenuously denied” that Britain expelled Argentine citizens from the Falklands in 1833. A spokesman said: “The people of the Falklands are British and have chosen to be so. They remain free to choose their own futures, both politically and economically, and have a right to self-determination as enshrined in the UN Charter. “This is a fundamental human right for all peoples. There are three parties to this debate, not just two as Argentina likes to pretend. The Islanders can’t just be written out of history. “As such, there can be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless and until such time as the Islanders so wish.”
The diplomatic broadside follows the British government's decision last month to name a large frozen chunk of Antarctica after the Queen – a gesture viewed in Buenos Aires as provocative. Falkland Islands

Comments
Three straight defeats and another title challenge in tatters. It did not help the despondent mood in the Liverpool camp that this loss came down to an incident tinged with comedy. Darren Bent’s winner hit a beach ball as it went into the net, leaving Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina baffled, then furious. As it turned out, an obscure rule states that play should have been restarted with a dropped ball. Life’s a beach. At least Steve Bruce didn’t give it the man of the match award. “Did any of you know that rule?” Bruce asked to general press box bemusement. “If you know that rule, that it had to be a dropped ball, you have to be one saddo. They got the guy on telly who threw it on. It’s got Liverpool crests all over it. What a shame.”
Sunderland might have got lucky with the goal but their performance was deserving of victory. The only downside were the worrying injuries sustained by Lee Cattermole (twisted knee) and Kenwyne Jones (ankle). “That’s like losing our Gerrard and Torres,” Bruce said. Related Articles

Benítez came into this game swamped by injury problems of his own. Not only had Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres picked up injuries on national duty, but Javier Mascherano and Emiliano Insua were so late back from helping Argentina qualify for the World Cup that they went straight to the team hotel in Sunderland on landing and were only ready for the bench. That meant Benítez sent out a strange starting line-up. With all three centre-halves on the field - Jamie Carragher, Daniel Agger and Martin Skrtel - it wasn’t initially clear what Liverpool’s formation was - not least to the players themselves. Jay Spearing, at 20, came into central midfield for his first Premier League start while Dirk Kuyt played on his own up front. It looked like a scratch side and, for most of this game, played like one. If Benítez thought the injuries, travel delays and jet lag that had weakened his squad was the end of his bad luck he was mistaken. In the fifth minute Sunderland took the lead with an inflatable assist. Cattermole came charging forward with the ball on the counter-attack and worked it out to Andy Reid on the right. The Irishman crossed and it was flicked to the far post by Steed Malbranque. Bent was there, in plenty of space, and struck the ball cleanly. However, it struck a red beach ball thrown on from the away end, wrong-footing Reina before nestling into the back of the net. The keeper had been further confused by Glen Johnson accidentally booting the beach ball as he tried to block Bent’s shot. Reina and Johnson protested volubly to the referee and his assistant referee, to no avail. Having taken that - admittedly fortunate - lead, Bruce’s team never looked back, led to victory by their inspiring captain, Lorik Cana, who played the first half in central midfield and the second at centre-back. The hard-tackling Albanian must surely be one of the most astute signings of the summer. “On days like this you don’t want to single out individual players,” Bruce said, “but with that I’ve witnessed one of the exceptional performances from a centre-back. And I’ve seen some good ones.” The in-form Bent had four good chances to kill the game, two in the first half, two in the second, but couldn’t quite capitalise on them. When Reid floated a cross to the far post on 22 minutes, Bent could not get enough power on his header while, 15 minutes later, the man desperate to force his way into Fabio Capello’s World Cup squad could only glance Phil Bardsley’s cross wide, with Reina stranded. After the break, Bent hit the outside of the post after rounding Reina and then was denied by the goalkeeper after appearing to have wriggled round him after Jones had played a clever through ball. The pressure was getting to Bruce and he had a touchline bust-up with Benítez when the Spanish manager asked for the clock to be stopped when Jones was injured. “It was on the spur of the moment and I think I made a prat of myself,” Bruce said. Liverpool struggled to make more than half-chances but as the game drew out, Sunderland grew nervous. To the home support’s horror, the fourth official held up a Fergie-esque seven minutes of stoppage time. A supporter who had been lovingly preparing a celebratory cigar pulverised it in frustration. He shouldn’t have been so rash. For Sunderland, this was a victory to savour.

Nice guys get the girls Nice guys can get the girl of their dreams, according to scientists who studied testosterone levels in mice. Nice guys can get the girl of their dreams Photo: GETTY	By Telegraph Reporter 9:45AM GMT 23 Feb 2009
Comments
They came to their conclusion after studying the breeding strategies of striped mice in South Africa. They found that dominant males who controlled breeding groups had lower testosterone levels than subdominant males.Research team leader Carsten Schradin said: "What is unusual about this society is that the dominant males are in fact the most sociable, often grooming other group members."It is the smaller and solitary living males, which roam from one group to another, that have the highest testosterone levels."The roaming males try to coerce females to mate, which, as one might imagine, is less successful than establishing a breeding group."

The study was reported in the American Naturalist and could explain why men who say it with flowers are more likely to succeed with women than those who behave like cavemen, according to the Express newspaper.Striped mice are abundant in southern Africa.Meanwhile, the mystery of how one bird emerges to lead a flock was revealed - they are either very hungry or very anti-social.Researchers from Brighton and Leeds universities said leaders of big groups of birds, mammals or insects emerge naturally because they have strong views about where to go or because they do not care if the flock breaks up.
