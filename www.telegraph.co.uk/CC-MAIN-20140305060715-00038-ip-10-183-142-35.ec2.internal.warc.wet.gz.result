What to grow in a greenhouse in winter
With the right growing techniques, an unheated greenhouse can be a productive, pollution-free garden asset all through the year.
It’s easy being green: powering down your greenhouse encourages a cannier approach to growing
By John Walker
8:00AM GMT 26 Feb 2013
Comments
Visitors entering my lean-to greenhouse at this time of year (it’s on the north-east wall of my cottage, where the front door is) are invariably stunned: “You don’t have any heating? So how come all this stuff survives?” Amid pots and containers brimming with anything from land cress to mizuna, I smugly explain that I don’t need to turn up the heat to enjoy something fresh from my greenhouse 365 days of the year. In fact, I use no heat at all in my greenhouse – other than the free, non-polluting kind I harvest from the sun. Although I still find the smell of a paraffin heater powerfully evocative – I’m whisked off to boyhood winters, pottering with sooty wicks, cold drips and sheets of bubble plastic – my days of heating a greenhouse are long gone. It was my awareness of climate change that got me turning the heat down and, eventually, off. I could no longer square using precious energy (be it in liquid, gas or electrical form) to raise, by a few degrees, the temperature of a terribly inefficient at heat-holding structure during the coldest months. But powering down my greenhouse and garden hasn’t meant horticultural austerity; it’s quite the opposite. It’s made me more season-attuned and encouraged a cannier approach to growing. Growing cold does mean some changes, such as sowing later, making more of the background warmth of the house itself to kick-start seeds into life, and being content with harvests later than you’re used to. Hug a greenhouse This is the perfect season to turn your gardening greener. Choose a crisp, frosty day, and go for a neighbourhood ramble. Keep your eye out for the glint of sun on glass, and make the most of gaps in fences and hedges. There are lots of empty greenhouses looking for love, and all you need do to hug one is ask its owners if they still want it. Related Articles

If you feel less bold, check the classifieds in your local paper. You might chance upon a “free to dismantler” or pick up a bargain for a fraction of the price of a new one. Or spread your net by signing up for your local Freecycle or Freegle group. The best bit about acquiring a preloved, second-hand greenhouse isn’t just the bargain element. By reusing it, you’re reinvigorating all the energy used to make it in the first place. And if you’re concerned about locating spares and doing repairs, an online search for “greenhouse spares” reveals a cornucopia of suppliers for every bit and bob imaginable. What, no propagator?
When I gave up heating my greenhouse I retired my electric propagator, too. Many seeds germinate quite readily, albeit more slowly, in the fluctuating temperatures of a sun-powered greenhouse. My “propagator” these days is a collection of clean, inside-out plastic compost bags. To turn it on, I place pots and trays inside a bag and put them on a sunlit piece of staging. If you sow a lot of seeds, split the bags open and lay them over the pots, black side up (they also prevent compost from drying out too quickly). Seeds that need a warm and constant temperature can come indoors for a bit of pampering. A windowsill in your most inhabited room or your boiler/airing cupboard is ideal (evict those towels). Check regularly for signs of life then get them into the light straight away. Freeze and thaw To guarantee fresh pickings in deep midwinter, you need to stay ahead of the frost game. Once a spell of prolonged freezing weather sets in, and crops have turned dark, sagged and the compost/soil is frozen solid, it’s impossible to harvest them until they thaw (they’ll snap if you try). If falling temperatures are forecast, cut some of what you want and store it in the fridge, or move pots of winter salad leaves to a frost-free place indoors. Covering crops with multiple layers of horticultural fleece (two or three at least) will give extra frost protection, but remove it straightaway once a thaw sets in. During milder spells, harvest at will, but keep the vents open and the air moving to deter fungal diseases like grey mould (botrytis). Keep crops on the dry side and only water, sparingly, when they just begin to wilt. FIVE TO SOW NOW Late winter isn’t just for gazing at seed and plant catalogues. The following are best sown in pots or trays and, unless the weather’s mild, brought indoors to germinate. There’s no need to thoroughly soak the compost after sowing (which we tend to do for spring and summer sowings), just moisten it lightly. Once germinated, move seeds back to the greenhouse, only bringing them indoors on very cold nights. Don’t expect them to romp away as they would in spring; growth, depending on the weather, will be slow but steady. Salad leaves I aim to sow at least one 12cm (5in) pot of salad leaves every week and get two or maybe three cuts per pot. Right now, the hardier oriental brassicas, green in the snow, komatsuna, mizuna and red mustard can be germinated indoors and will be ready, depending on the weather, in around six weeks. Mangetout peas 'Oregon Sugar Pod’ stands low temperatures better than others. Sow four seeds to a 10cm (4in) pot. Pot on into 30cm (12in) pots when around 15cm (6in) tall and support with 1.2m (4ft) long twiggy sticks, or plant in soil beds. Sweet peas I never get around to sowing in October, but I’ve often caught up by sowing in November, December or January/February. You’ll still get flowers weeks ahead of spring-sown plants. Broad beans Sowing now produces young plants for early spring, planting either in beds (near the door so bees will find and pollinate them) or outdoors. Sow one seed to an 8cm (3in) pot. 'Aquadulce Claudia’ is reliable. Early-pull carrots 'Amsterdam Forcing’ and 'Early Nantes’ do well from late-winter sowings in a 30cm (12in) pot. By spring you’ll have tender young roots to pull. YEAR-ROUND SCHEDULE Winter Bring pot-grown strawberries into the greenhouse in January (they flower and fruit best after being frosted). Remove dead leaves and repot in fresh peat-free compost. You are their pollinator: dust pollen between the flowers with a small brush, then enjoy the rewards from early May. Spring It’s all systems sow as your greenhouse captures increasing amounts of sunshine. Slugs will thrive in ever-wetter summers, so start plants in pots or multi-celled trays to give them a head start when planted outdoors, aided by some organic slug pellets. Summer Make the most of warmth-loving crops. Indoor tomatoes, peppers, aubergines, cucumbers and melons all need the raised temperatures of a greenhouse to succeed. Autumn Use the warm, rain-free space of your greenhouse to store/ripen onions. Lay trays in full sun so skins bake and ripen fully. Ditto with pumpkins and winter squash.

David Cameron: we will not make any more cuts to troops
There will be no further job losses in Army, Navy or Air Force, David Cameron has promised.
By Rowena Mason and Benedict Brogan
4:17PM BST 14 Jun 2013
Comments
The Prime Minister promised not to reduce the size of the military any more the day after General Sir Peter Wall, the head of the Army, said additional cuts to troops could harm Britain's ability to win wars. His intervention is likely to calm a bitter Government row over military spending, as the Ministry of Defence resists deep cuts demanded by the Treasury as part of the Spending Review for the year 2015/16.
The Treasury is seeking £11.5 billion of savings across all departments and is expecting the Ministry of Defence to submit to its share of cuts. However, military chiefs have warned it will cripple the armed forces and Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, has been fighting against any moves that would have an impact on Britain's frontline fighting capabilities. With just weeks to go before the Spending Review must be finalised, Mr Cameron spoke out to make it clear that the Ministry of Defence will find ways of saving money that do not involve more job losses than those already planned.

“We're not going to be making further cuts to the numbers of our Army, Navy or Air Force, they know what they have available,” he said ahead of the G8 summit of world leaders this weekend. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph in Camp Bastion, Mr Hammond also indicated that the savings target could be met without “manpower reductions”. “We are in the middle of a spending review process and I'm not going to give a running commentary on it," he said. "But I'm confident that we will deliver solutions which will protect manpower needs. The Prime Minister has already protected the equipment budget. That doesn't mean the Ministry of Defence won't be left with a challenge but it's defined by what I think will be an ability to protect manpower needs. "We can find efficiency savings without having to look at manpower reductions. There is no apetite for manpower reductions."
Earlier, Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, insisted the Ministry of Defence will still be required to make some deep savings, despite the complaints of senior officers about the impact on their ability to defend the country. He said it was possible to make find savings when the Ministry of Defence has "more horses than tanks". However, senior military figures have been deeply concerned that the Army will be unable to cope, particularly when its number of soldiers is already being slashed from 102,000 to 82,000. Gen Sir Peter Wall told Sky News on Thursday that further cuts would be dangerous, disruptive and damage the country’s ability to win wars. “Imposing more on us now before the last round of efficiencies have really materialised properly in a balanced way would be very disruptive," he said last night. "We have got to the point in a number of parts of our set-up where we can’t go any further without seriously damaging our professional competence and our chances of success on the battlefields of the future.”
Gen Nick Carter, the most senior British officer in Afghanistan, also said that politicians and not the military would be to blame for any depletion of Britain’s military resources: “At the end of the day our politicians need to determine what they want the Army to do. If they determine that the Army is going to do less then it’s reasonable for them to reduce it still further.”
He added: “We are bound as military people to point out the risks during the course of this to our political masters and ultimately it’s down to them to look themselves in the mirror each morning and determine whether or not those risks are manageable.”

Syria massacre: activists post video of 'Treimsa victims'
Syrian activists have posted videos they claim show at least 16 of the dozens of people reportedly killed in heavy government shelling on a farming village in central Syria.
1:48PM BST 13 Jul 2012
If confirmed, the massacre in the village of Treimsa in Syria would be the latest in a string of deadly assaults by President Bashar Assad's regime since a nationwide uprising erupted over a year ago. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said early on Friday that it had reports of more than 150 people killed in Thursday's heavy government shelling on Treimsa, a farming village some 9 miles northwest of the central city of Hama. It had however only collected 30 names of the victims. One of the posted videos shows the dead bodies of 15 men lined up on a floor. Some are covered in blood and have wounds to their heads and chests. Another video shows a young man wailing over the lifeless body of an elderly man wrapped in a blanket and lying in the street.

"Come on, dad. For the sake of God, get up," the man sobs. An explosion is heard in the background. Another video shows a tank on what is claimed to be a street in Treimsa. The authenticity of the videos cannot be independently verified due to restrictions on foreign reporters. The Syrian government gave a very different account of the Tremseh deaths, with the state news agency saying that dozens of members of "armed terrorist groups" had raided the village and were randomly firing on residents. Security forces clashed with the armed men, killing and capturing many of them, the report said. It said three soldiers and some 50 residents were killed. Syria

Hermès showcase the Arceau Ecuyère watch at SalonQP
With impeccable crafstmanship and subtle nods to Hermès' equestrian heritage, the Arceau Ecuyère watch is more covetable that any designer handbag. The Hermès Arceau Ecuyère combines an elegant silhouette with diamonds around the bezel and radiating motif on the dial By Maria DoultonFounder of The Jewellery Editor
12:05PM BST 01 Oct 2012
See the Hermès Arceau Ecuyère watch up close at SalonQP Everything that Hermès makes is stamped with the distinctive house style that more often than not takes us back to the stable with horse-inspired motifs. In the case of the Arceau Ecuyère watch, the equestrian link is to be found in the detail of the leather strap neatly wrapping around the stirrup-shaped loop on the top of the watch. Like everything signed by Hermès, the quality is absolutely tip-top, from the hand-stitched strap to the intricate pattern on the dial. I can also vouch for the quality of the mechanical movement as I have seen where and how they are painstakingly made at the prestigious Vaucher Manufacture in Switzerland. The automatic mechanical movement inside this watch has a 50-hour power reserve, meaning that if worn regularly, it will rarely need winding up. Even the inside of the watch is decorated, and you can admire the movement whirring away through the glass back of the case. Had I the cash to hand, mine would be the Arceau over any Hermès handbag, though ideally, one would have both, in several colours. Starting price is £10,700 in stainless steel with a diamond-set bezel. Related Articles

Super League to be cut to 12 teams from 2015 season
Confirmation that Super League will reduce from 14 to 12 clubs from 2015 will spark a mass scramble to avoid relegation at the end of next season. The heat is on: clubs are currently protected by the three-year licensing system Photo: PA	By Telegraph Sport, and agencies

Clubs are currently protected by the three-year licensing system but the safety net will be removed following yesterday's decision taken at the Super League clubs' annual meeting. A decision has still to be made on whether there will be straight-forward promotion and relegation between Super League and a 12-team Championship or whether clubs will back a convoluted proposal by the Rugby Football League's executive to divide the two leagues into three qualifying divisions of eight two-thirds of the way through the season. But the clubs finally agreed to ditch a proposal to go down to 10 after earlier rejecting the idea of maintaining the status quo. Super League began in 1996 with 12 clubs, went briefly to 14 in 1999 before reverting to 12 a year later following two mergers. It stayed at 12 until 2009 when Crusaders and Salford were admitted as part of a new licensing system. Related Articles

In taking their decision yesterday, the clubs acknowledged that the absence of regular promotion and relegation removed a significant degree of excitement and drama from the sport. London Broncos are currently bottom of Super League and it has been confirmed that they would not be spared relegation if they finished in the bottom two in 2014, despite their special status as the only full-time club in the capital. The news was given a cautious welcome by St Helens' England forward Jon Wilkin, who is chairman of the Super League Players' Association, 1eagu3, which initially rejected the split idea out of hand. "Some change is required in the competition structure," he said. "We were probably overstretching our resources and this is an opportunity to make the competition more intense, commercially viable and sustainable. "Promotion and relegation is something associated with British sport. Some clubs have a rich history and have been an integral part of the game so it's good to have access back to the top flight. "It's a positive step for the game, if tied up with a strong commercial plan." Although the financial detail has still to be ironed out, it is thought Super League clubs would receive distributions in 2015 and 2016 that are broadly similar to what they receive now, which is around £1.3million a year. Under the split option, the Championship clubs would receive payments ranging from £150,000 to £650,000, depending on league positions. Super League clubs would also receive additional payments to help fund academy structures and there would be parachute payments to help offset the effects of relegation. The next step of the RFL's policy review is for the Championship clubs to discuss the two remaining options at their meeting next Wednesday before the Super League clubs re-convene while an extraordinary general meeting is expected to be called in August to make a final decision.

Le Grotte della Civita, Matera, Italy
"By any standards, Le Grotte is a luxury hotel," wrote Tim Jepson for Telegraph Travel after his stay. "But this is not the luxury of a Four Seasons, say, or a Maldivian island idyll. The floors are uneven, the rock walls unadorned. There is no restaurant. With a few exceptions, there are no windows. Rather, this is the luxury of the unique experience, the luxury of the one-off, the luxury of a setting and backstory with which no other hotel can compete or compare."
