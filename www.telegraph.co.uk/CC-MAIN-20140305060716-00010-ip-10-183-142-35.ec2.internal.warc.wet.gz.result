Flood victim rescues goldfish found swimming down street
Dave Pope rescued three goldfish with a teapot after seeing a "splash of orange" as he waded down a street in flood-hit Egham, Surrey
Nick Collins
6:54PM GMT 18 Feb 2014
After a week covering the misery and devastation of the flooding in southern England, this truly warmed my heart.
Dave Pope’s neighbourhood is currently under so much water that there are goldfish swimming down the street. He’s probably got bigger things to worry about than their welfare.
But did he leave them to be drained away along with the rest of the deluge? Of course he didn’t. He grabbed the nearest teapot and whisked them to safety. Here’s to you, Dave.

Abu Qatada and eight other terror detainees awarded compensation by European judges
European judges yesterday awarded Abu Qatada and eight other terror detainees thousands of pounds in compensation despite accepting that they were held because of a public emergency.

7:00AM GMT 20 Feb 2009
The radical cleric was among a total of 11 terror suspects or fanatics who were held without trial under terror laws introduced in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that their detention breached their rights and awarded nine of them around £2,500, plus total costs of £53,000. Two of the detainees were not awarded compensation because they left the country voluntarily. However the judges said the payment was low to reflect the fact that the laws had been introduced in an attempt to protect the public. One of the detainees, Abu Rideh, reacted angrily to the settlement saying: “This is nothing. What is £3,000?” The 38-year-old Palestinian, who is accused of having links to the cleric Abu Hamza, was detained in 2001, bailed in 2005 and placed on a control order. He added: “This is rubbish money. I don’t want this money — give it back.”

Anti-terror laws face new human rights challenge
03 Nov 2012
On Wednesday the House of Lords concluded it was safe to deport Qatada to Jordan and he is now attempting to take that case to Europe as well. It was put on hold last night, as expected, after the European Court of Human Rights said it would consider whether to hear his case following the House of Lords judgement. If the case goes ahead, it could mean he could stay in the country for at least another year while the case is dealt with. Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said: “I am keen to deport this dangerous individual as soon as I can but we are bound by European law. I will defend our case vigorously there and hope the Strasbourg Court reaches the same conclusion as the House of Lords.”
Meanwhile, human rights lawyers claimed the latest ECHR ruling could also pave the way for him to be released from his current detention. Chris Grayling, the shadow home secretary, said: “This decision will horrify most reasonable people in the UK. It shows just how incompetent the Government has been at managing the problem of preachers of hate.” Qatada was detained without charge under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. The court said the terms of the detention violated three provisions of the Human Rights Convention. However, the judges rejected a fourth complaint, declaring that the detention of Qatada and the others did not amount to a violation of a ban on “torture and inhuman or degrading treatment”. The judges stressed that the compensation was “substantially lower” than in previous cases. This was “in view of the fact that the detention scheme was devised in the face of a public emergency” that had been “threatening the life of the nation”. Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, said she was “very disappointed” with the compensation but added: “I am pleased that the court recognised that these old measures were devised in 'good faith’ to protect the public”. Qatada was first detained in 2002, when the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) described him as a “truly dangerous individual”. It said he had given religious authority to high-profile terrorists across the world. The 48-year-old, who came to Britain in 1993 on a forged passport, was later bailed, but placed under a control order. In 2005 he was arrested in preparation for his deportation, but was again released on appeal. He was returned to jail last November for breaching his bail terms after a hearing, which was based largely on evidence held in secret. But Justice, the human rights group, said yesterday’s ruling indicated that such evidence breached a person’s rights and claimed that could pave the way for Qatada to challenge his detention.

Two dead as typhoon hits southeastern China At least two people have been killed and roughly 750,000 evacuated as Typhoon Fitow made landfall on China's east coast. More than half a million people have been evacuated By Malcolm Moore, Beijing

Heavy rain lashed the Chinese coast from Shanghai down to Fujian province, with winds blowing at almost 100mph. The typhoon began dumping heavy and torrential rain across the southeastern seaboard, with rainfall of up to 8 inches in some parts as well as gusty winds. In a suburb of Wenzhou, one of China's wealthiest and most important cities, around 1,200 homes collapsed and two were killed, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. One of the victims, 55-year-old Ni Wenlin, died "after strong wind blew him off a hill" late on Sunday, Xinhua reported. He was with five others on the way to rescue a fisherman from a nearby port.
Two more victims, port workers in Wenzhou, are missing and may have been blown into the sea. Related Articles

Airports were closed and the eastern high-speed rail corridor also shut, while the typhoon snapped electricity poles and caused some power cuts. Some motorways and bus services were also shut down. As many as 65,000 fishing boats were grounded while 574,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in Zhejiang and a further 177,000 in Fujian. Named after a flower from Micronesia, Fitow hit just two weeks after Typhoon Usagi struck south China, leaving at least 25 dead. China's annual storm season is coming to its end, however, and Xinhua said it was unusual for a typhoon to make land in October. Fitow is the 23rd major storm to hit China this year. Elsewhere in Asia, a typhoon east of the northern Philippines blew away with no impact on the country. China
