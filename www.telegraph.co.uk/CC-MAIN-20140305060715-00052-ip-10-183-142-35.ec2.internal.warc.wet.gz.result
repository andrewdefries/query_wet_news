New island appears off coast of Germany A new island the size of 34 acres and providing sanctuary for hundreds of sea birds has emerged from the waters of the North Sea. A new island has emerged from the waters of the North Sea off the German coast Photo: Alamy By Matthew Day
11:51AM GMT 10 Jan 2013
Despite its youthful age the sickle-shaped island lying 16 miles off the coast of the German state of Schleswig Holstein is already home to around 50 different plant species and proved popular with sea birds such as herring gulls and oyster catchers, eager to take advantage of its unspoilt and pristine environment.
Formed over just 10 years, the rapid appearance of the island has surprised scientists familiar with the strong winds and shifting shifts that characterise Germany's North Sea coast.
"The fact that in just a few years a new island is formed is very impressive," said Detlef Hansen, who works at the neighbouring Wadden Sea National Park. "For conservationists this is anything but ordinary." The formation of new sandbanks in the shallow waters of the Wadden Sea park are not uncommon but scientist said it is rare for one to survive the winter storms and establish itself as an island. The new land mass now boast dunes as high as four metres, and the grasses and other plants emerging from its windswept surface have provided it with a certain resilience to the eroding hand of nature.
Given the name Norderoogsand, the island has also benefited from lying in a position sheltered by other islands and from the fact that over the past decade there have been few high storm surges.

Dispatch: the Syrian ghost town that shows the future of Aleppo
For a foretaste of the future of Aleppo, you need venture only as far as the nondescript, silent town of Anadan just eight miles to the north-west.

7:14PM BST 22 Aug 2012
Follow The sound of war is absent, but so is the sound of everything else. When the light breeze drops, not even the shutters covering the shopfronts rattle.
There is no call to prayer from the central mosque, still open for the vanished faithful but deserted, its floor lined with broken glass. The market is empty, stalls cleared of everything up to the stone walls.
There are blasts marks and shell-holes from the battles that sent the women and children and finally men too into flight. But the effect is more ghostly than that suggests, long streets of homes that are mostly intact but seem never to expect anyone to live there again.
Anadan was one of the wellsprings of the uprising in Aleppo province that culminated in the capture of half the ancient city itself. It was the scene of a vicious battle in June between the rebels of the Free Syrian Army, mostly local men, and government troops, before the regime's tanks were driven out.
Since then it has been shelled from bases in the northern half of the city, and bombed from the air. Earlier this month Amnesty International released satellite imagery of 600 shell craters in and around the town.

Though many seem to have missed their targets, the effect was to drive tens of thousands of people to the refugee centres on the border with Turkey, where 70,000 Syrian have already fled, or to other villages and towns.
In corners, some few men remain – mostly FSA, along with a few supporters – out of a population of 20-30,000. "There are six families here, from 2,000," said Mazen Afash, 23, one of them. He was in his repair-shop for motorbikes, now a vital form of transport for rebels in rural areas.
"My family have gone. The women here have mostly fled to Marta, a village six kilometres away. The smaller villages are in less danger than the towns."
He is right. In the last two weeks, a new menace has been added to the shelling or occasional attack from ground forces – now, in any case, tied up in the siege of Aleppo city. Fighter jet attacks, used sporadically before, are being used to intimidate the rebels and their supporters across the province.
A double strike on residential areas in nearby Aazaz last week killed 50 civilians, the worst single such attack of the war. But other towns also suffer sporadic and apparently irrational raids, a bomb or two at a time, not intense enough or accurate enough to further any military purpose but terrifying local populations.
One – a single bomb, falling apparently harmlessly – hit the countryside outside Anadan the morning the Daily Telegraph visited. Another landed in a field next to an outdoor swimming pool used by local teenagers, but empty at the time, outside the town of Mari last week. The town of Tal Rifaat has been singled out for repeated aerial assault.
Each raid is followed by a new surge of arrivals at the refugee camps on the border with Turkey, women and children loaded into farm vehicles with what possessions they can muster, packing the country lanes.
The regime has little sympathy towards this area, and the feeling is mutual. These towns took part in the Muslim Brotherhood uprising against President Hafez al-Assad in the late seventies and early eighties, and many families lost men in that revolt's bloody suppression.
Anadan is home to the political leader of the lead rebel unit fighting in Aleppo, the Liwa al-Tawhid or "Unity Brigade" – the term has both a religious meaning, referring to the Oneness of Allah, and a secular one.
Abdulaziz al-Salameh "Abu Juma'a" was a honey trader before launching his rebellion.
"He's strong, he's fighting for us, he's part of us," said Mustafa Qassem, 20, an FSA man guarding, from no one, a junction in town. "Abu Juma'a was famous for his honey, and we respect him. He is very pious."
Another Anadan native is Abu Juma'a's cousin, Abdulrahman al-Salameh, who heads a battalion of the Jubhat al-Nusra, a much more radical Islamist brigade which denies frequent reports that it is allied to al-Qaeda.
The regime's tactics may be intended to scare the province into submission, the tactic which worked for Hafez al-Assad for so long. But it may just have engendered a reckless, religious, do-or-die bravery.
Out of Anadan's silence, there came a sudden clanking and roaring. There were no regime tanks for miles, but a gun-turret suddenly poked its nose into the square. Bouncing down the road was a captured Russian T55, belching black smoke out of one corner and lurching forwards with difficulty on its half-repaired tracks.
Four young FSA men cheered from its top as it disappeared into the distance, an appropriately Mad Max-style breaking of the silence.
That tank was never going to liberate Damascus, but the MiGs won't tame Aleppo on their own either. The betting must be on more attrition, more flight, more emptied towns before this is over.

Manchester City will battle to retain Premier League title until last kick of the season insists goalkeeper Joe Hart
Goalkeeper Joe Hart claims Manchester City will fight to retain their Premier League title to the very last game of the season - even if winning the league becomes mathematically impossible.

Manchester City's hopes of retaining their title look slim with rivals Manchester United holding a 12-point lead at top of the table with just 11 games remaining. The champions boosted confidence after a run of three league games without a win by seeing off third-placed Chelsea on Sunday and Hart is determined to keep the dream alive. The England goalkeeper, who saved a penalty from Frank Lampard in the 2-0 victory, said: ''Even if there is one game to go and we are 12 points behind, we'll still believe. We've got to. ''We've got to keep fighting, you never know. We have just got to keep going. ''It's going to be really hard, we've got a lot to do but we're going to have a damn good go at doing it.''

Manager Roberto Mancini was scathing of his players after a dismal and damaging defeat at Southampton just over a fortnight ago but Hart claims their spirit was never in doubt. The 25-year-old, himself subject of individual criticism from Mancini since the loss at St Mary's Stadium, said: ''We have got it, no doubt about it. ''We all under-performed against Southampton - that's gone, you can't do anything now, you move on from that. You have got to look forward. ''You can speculate and talk about the past but we have just got to look forward and try to win. The only way is up for us.'' City are not in action again until they travel to struggling Aston Villa next Monday, by which time they could be 15 points behind United. Mancini hopes captain Vincent Kompany will be fit to return after five games out with a calf injury which has taken longer than expected to heal. Mancini said: ''The calf is a strange injury, and it is very dangerous. I hope we can recover him for Aston Villa.'' Midfielder Gareth Barry will hope to prove his fitness from an ankle problem while Mancini has also revealed right-back Maicon faces a month on the sidelines after a knee operation. The Brazilian missed the Christmas programme and the whole of January with a knee injury but had made three substitute appearances this month. Mancini said: ''He has had surgery on his knee, but in a month he can recover. The operation was to clean his meniscus.'' Manchester City

Lewis Hamilton faces Formula One battle in 'uncompetitive' car Lewis Hamilton did not expect to start the defence of his first world title from a position of weakness. Shifting gear: Lewis Hamilton's McLaren may not be at full speed at the start of the season Photo: PA	By Andrew Baker 2:00PM GMT 21 Mar 2009
Comments
Champions rarely do. But the mostly dismal form of McLaren during winter test sessions has forced the young Briton's new boss, Martin Whitmarsh, to concede that his cars are highly unlikely to be at the front of the grid for the start of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix next Sunday. "We do not yet have the technical package that will allow our drivers to fight at the front," said Whitmarsh, who replaced Ron Dennis as McLaren's team principal at the start of the month. "In Formula One there is nowhere to hide: that's what makes our sport so demanding and yet so endlessly fascinating."
'Demanding' is the word to pick up on here, and Hamilton, as McLaren's undoubted team leader, will be the one making the demands in the pit lane at Albert Park in Melbourne. A driver with the number 1 on his car does not expect that car to be lost in the midfield. Unlike his main rivals, Kimi Raikkonen, Felipe Massa, Fernando Alonso and Robert Kubica, Hamilton has never driven a poor Formula One car. Jenson Button, the fellow Briton who has emerged, startlingly, as favourite for the season's first race with the new Brawn team, endured dozens of dismal races at the wheel of hopelessly uncompetitive cars in his team's former incarnation as Honda.

Hamilton: New F1 rules are a shame
20 Mar 2009
For Hamilton to climb into a car at the start of a weekend knowing that it has little chance of carrying him to a podium position will be a novel and unwelcome experience. But Whitmarsh, who has known the 24-year-old since he was a child, is aware of the depth of character of his driver, and is confident that he has the determination to prevail. "It has been extraordinary to watch Lewis maturing into a man and a champion," Whitmarsh said. "There is a depth of humanity there that is quite remarkable. Some drivers are nasty bastards, quite impervious to what is going on around them. Lewis is less impervious, but he has been battle-hardened like no other driver of his age."
McLaren's team principal is referring to the season of 2007, in which Hamilton, on the podium in his first nine races, enjoyed an unprecedented introduction to the sport, before a public falling-out with his eminent team-mate, Alonso, and the team's subsequent involvement in a spying scandal. "We all came out of 2007 feeling scarred and battered," Whitmarsh recalled. "But Lewis was more immediately reflective than some of us."
This strength of character, he believes, will have been reinforced by winning the drivers' title. "If he had lost last year he would have had massive, massive pressure," Whitmarsh said. "You know, 'Will he ever win it?' But when you sit with him now you sense the confidence of a champion."
Whitmarsh steered Hamilton's career once the Hertfordshire teenager came under the auspices of McLaren. With Ron Dennis, he picked the teams that their protégé should drive for as he made his way up the ladder through Formula Renault, Formula Three and GP2. The former aerospace engineer has been with McLaren for two decades, and has indelible memories of another great driver whose finest years were spent with the Woking team. "I remember the first time I met Ayrton Senna properly," he said. "We were testing the McLaren MP4-5B. He had spun off the track and ripped the bottom of the chassis out. He knocked on my door and walked in and apologised. You can imagine how I felt... Ayrton Senna, saying sorry to me."
Whitmarsh recalls Senna as a charming individual, who nonetheless never failed to find every opportunity to establish a psychological advantage over his rivals – and his team-mates. "Ayrton was pure intensity," Whitmarsh said. "By comparison, Lewis is a fuller human being, and that is a great strength. There's no doubt that he leads a fuller life, but with that humanity comes some vulnerability."
That vulnerability seems likely to be tested in the early races of this season, as testing form indicates that McLaren are unlikely to be able to push for victories straight away. This is bad news because the sport's governing body, the FIA, have imposed a new rule which dictates that teams may not test between races, which will make it harder for any outfit struggling for pace to evaluate new technological solutions. Whitmarsh remains upbeat and confident in the ability of his engineers and his drivers to get McLaren back to the front. "I'd like Lewis Hamilton to be world champion during my watch," he said. "We begin our season with huge determination to reassert ourselves at the front and we will not rest for a moment until we have done that. Most importantly, we haven't forgotten how to win."
