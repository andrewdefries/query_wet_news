Lord Browne review: university teaching budgets slashed by 80%
Unpopular university courses will be forced to shut under new plans to cut direct state funding for degrees, it has emerged. Direct funding for almost all degrees, with the exception of priority subjects such as science, will be cut. Photo: ALAMY	By Graeme Paton, Education Editor
2:27PM BST 12 Oct 2010
Comments
A radical review of higher education – published on Tuesday – recommends slashing the university teaching grant by 80 per cent. The move would wipe out all Government subsidises for classroom-based subjects such as the arts, humanities and social sciences, it was disclosed. Only strategically important courses, including medicine, science and technology, which are traditionally more expensive to run, will be propped up with state support. In all, the move would cut university teaching budgets from £3.5 billion to just £700 million. The conclusions are likely to be embraced by ministers desperate to find public sector savings to reduce the national debt. Related Articles

Lord Browne review: the key points explained
12 Oct 2010
It is believed universities will be forced to impose student tuition fees of around £7,000 a year – more than twice the current rate – just to maintain existing levels of funding. The recommendation – in a report delivered to the Coalition on Tuesday – represents a dramatic shift in the way universities are funded, with the burden falling on individual students instead of the state. Lord Browne, the former head of BP, who led the review, said it would “expose institutions to more competition” and ensure unpopular courses were effectively allowed to fail. Students should also be given more information related to employment prospects to make better course choices, he said. “In our proposals, public spending reductions are made by removing the blanket subsidy that the public currently provides for all courses… and targeting investment in priority areas rather than spreading it thinly,” said the report. “This will expose institutions to more competition as they will no longer get a large block grant year on year regardless of the quality of teaching.”
Lord Browne’s review recommends funding “priority” subjects. This includes sciences, technology, medicine, veterinary science, nursing, other healthcare degrees and certain “strategically important” language courses. In return for the investment, universities must guarantee “minimum levels of quality”, such as a set number of laboratory hours for applied science courses. University departments would be regularly vetted and funding stripped for courses failing to maintain standards. But the move has been criticised by academics who fear subjects such as the social sciences and humanities would be fatally undermined. Dr Robin Jackson, chief executive of the British Academy, said the move would “damage academic excellence and quality of life”. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: “It’s clear that diversity in our universities will also be affected by a substantial cut in teaching funding and the removal of all financial support from the state for arts, humanities and languages degrees. “Restricting funding to specific courses will also result in a more selective higher education, potentially denying access to certain students creating a decrease rather than an increase in social mobility.”
Mike Neary, professor of teaching and learning at Lincoln University, said: “The withdrawal of funding from these areas demonstrates clearly the anti-intellectual nature of the Coalition government, and its attempt to undermine the meaning and purpose of higher education.” Education News

Families still find room for a treat
Nigel Chapman tells Amy Wilson why the downturn is good for luxury breaks. 'The downturn is good for luxury breaks.' By Amy Wilson
3:12PM GMT 02 Feb 2013
Comments
When trying to make money from hotels in a recession, it helps if you have done it before.
A year ago, Nigel Chapman bought back the hotel chain he set up from Von Essen, which collapsed in 2011. He also bought three more hotels with the backing of property-focused private equity fund, Patron Capital.
Rather than feeling overwhelmed as he tries to increase bookings, repair the hotels’ neglected buildings and reputations and show majority shareholder Patron how it is going to make a return, Mr Chapman says he has been through worse.
In 1988 he sold the family house, left a solid career in accountancy and bought Woolley Grange in Wiltshire. With three young children in tow, he and his wife set about turning it from a grand house into a hotel while juggling a large mortgage. The original intention was that Mr Chapman’s brother would run the hotel, but that fell through. Related Articles

“We opened in May 1989, which wasn’t very auspicious,” he said. “Interest rates were sky-high and it was very, very difficult. Suddenly we found ourselves living there and running it 24/7 with the waterline going over our noses.”
Although they were novices, the Chapmans’ decision to build a luxury hotel that was family-friendly, with a good restaurant and a crèche so parents could have a break, paid off. Word-of-mouth recommendations meant the hotel started filling up, despite the recession of the early 1990s and the setback of the Gulf War.
With Woolley Grange full at weekends, Chapman got together with hotelier Nicholas Dickson and started to build up a small chain of four country house hotels called Luxury Family Hotels. At the same time, the pair set up a chain of city hotels called Alias. The two ventures were funded with a combination of bank debt and a group of as many as 500 shareholders, mainly guests, who put money into the new hotels in return for visiting rights.
Alias was sold to the Asian conglomerate Swire in 2006, with shareholders making back three times their investment, said Chapman. They made a similar return when Von Essen bought Luxury Family Hotels (LFH) for £30m the same year.
Chapman was not looking to sell the family hotels, but the shareholders felt it was an offer they could not refuse. Between 2006 and 2010, he developed a family resort in Portugal, then bought a hotel in Cornwall in 2010 with the intention of building another small chain similar to LFH.
His plans accelerated when Von Essen collapsed and he had the chance to buy back his original business. Chapman declines to confirm what he and Patron Capital paid, but the seven hotels were reportedly sold for £30m. The four hotels from the original chain were sold back for around half what Von Essen had paid for them.
“It was a good time to buy,” said Mr Chapman. “If you’ve got a decent track record and the assets are good, then banks will lend to you.”
Before the financial crisis, hotels were subject to all sorts of fancy financial engineering to leverage their value as property assets. While Mr Chapman was not caught out by that, he maintains that some debt is nothing to be afraid of.
“To get a decent return on your investment you need some debt in there,” he said.
The demands of the families who come for weekend breaks at the hotels have, of course, changed in the past 20 years, but Chapman says many parts of the formula are still the same.
“Von Essen kindly put in indoor pools and spas, which we couldn’t really afford to do in the 1990s,” he said. “We also now offer more than one sort of eating place. Families want to eat together in the evening, whereas in the past the kids had tea and the parents went for dinner once the children were in bed.”
There are also playrooms for older children with Wiis and other computer games. But the most popular activity at Ickworth, part of a former stately home in Suffolk, is still bicycle riding.
“It’s about giving people respite from working hard, and providing the right things so both they and their kids have a good time,” said Mr Chapman.
As well as refurbishing tired-looking rooms and public areas, he and his staff have overhauled sales and marketing, which he said had suffered from a lack of investment.
“We’ve missed six years of families having children, who don’t know anything about us,” he said. Reviews from journalists, advertising on sites such as Mumsnet and link-ups with complementary brands such as Trunki have all helped to revive the reputation of the hotels in the past year. As a result, revenue this year is expected to be 25pc higher than last year and the hotels are trading profitably, although not yet at the levels they were before the sale in 2006. “As we learned the last time, if we keep pedalling hard now then we’ll be in a really good position when times are better,” Mr Chapman said. “But it’s not impossible to do well in an economy like this. People do get into a mindset where they deny themselves things, but they can only do it for so long. Eventually they get tired of being miserable and think 'I’m going to do something I want to do’.”

Travel feedback of the week: January 2-8
Readers offer their feedback on travel stories and issues, including Chopin's Majorca and the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai. Chopin's Majorca: one reader enjoyed retracing the composer's trip to the Spanish island

A deserving winner
What a wonderful article Francis Phillips wrote for your Just Back writing competition (December 12) about a day trip to London with his daughter. It was so refreshing after tales of the Sahara, Amazon and the Wall of China. I was in tears after reading the last sentence. Thank you for choosing it. Kath Brett, by email Skiing in Poland
With regard to Adrian Bridge's article ("Skiing with divine guidance", January 2), Zakopane is cheap and a lovely place to start skiing. A taxi ride from Kraków is about £40 and takes about an hour and a half, but it is much cheaper by train. The main problem with the skiing is that the three areas (all a bit limited by Alpine standards) are not connected other than by bus and the inconvenience of getting from one to another is very frustrating. Still, combined with a visit to the lovely city of Kraków, three days in Zakopane is a good experience. Alex Fogwill, website comment

In praise of Majorca
In response to Nigel Tisdall's article about Majorca, ("Sun, sand and Chopin", January 2), we visited the island last June and found it to be everything we expected and much more. We went to a winery on the north coast and were especially enchanted with Valldemossa where we sampled local brandy, admired the beautiful landscape and enjoyed the laid-back lifestyle. We plan on returning and taking full advantage of all the wonderful experiences that the island has to offer. Adrienne Lee, website comment
Hotel efficiency
I was more than surprised to read of the chaos experienced in the breakfast room at The Grand in Eastbourne (Hotel Watch, January 2). I recently returned from a two-week holiday in the Gran Costa Meloneras Hotel, Gran Canaria, a 1,100 bedroom establishment. Never have I experienced such high standards of efficiency, cleanliness and courtesy. No matter how busy the restaurants were, everyone was served with courtesy and a smile. Crockery, cutlery and tablecloths were spotless and tables were cleared as soon as each course was finished. Being Christmas, this was an extremely busy time of the year yet standards did not drop. Why make the excuse that there were lots of visitors at the Eastbourne hotel for the annual air show? If a hotel is run efficiently, standards should not suffer no matter how full the hotel is.
Stella Bowman, by email
Depressing Dubai My wife and I recently decided to treat ourselves to lunch at the Burj Al Arab hotel. When we arrived at the security gate, the first guard asked us for our hotel and room number (we were staying with friends), the second for our phone number, the third wanted to know if we knew the Asian buffet lunch would cost more than £60 each and the fourth demanded our credit card details. Tiring of this routine, we asked our taxi driver to take us to a more customer friendly restaurant. Dubai is a very depressing place to visit. Each day brought news of further financial calamities and the sky is a forest of stationary tower cranes. Next trip, we'll stop over in Singapore.
Bob Pawsey, by email
Disoriented in Lebanon With reference to Charles Starmer-Smith's article about Lebanon ("Where to go in 2010", January 2), I sense Charles might have enjoyed too much of the nightlife in Beirut in suggesting that Tyre and Sidon are to the north in Lebanon. They are to the south of the country, while Baalbek and the Bekaa Valley are to the east. That said, my wife and I visited Lebanon last year, including most of the places mentioned in the article, and we could only agree with Charles about the vibrancy of the place.
