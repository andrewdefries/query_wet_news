Melody Sachs says Jonathan Ross should have been sacked for insulting her husband Melody Sachs, wife of Andrew Sachs, said Jonathan Ross should have been sacked for his role in leaving lewd voice messages on her husband's mobile telephone.

Mrs Sachs, 75, spoke for the first time about the scandal in which Ross claimed on Radio 2 that Russell Brand had slept with the Sachses' granddaughter, Georgina Baillie.She had been in hospital for an emergency hip replacement operation when the extent of the messages - and the public outrage to them - became clear last month."When I first heard the broadcast, I couldn't believe what I was hearing - the repeated abuse of my husband coming from the mouths of two grown men. How low can they get? It was very, very upsetting," she told the Daily Mail."Andrew is a wonderful man and the last person in the world to deserve their ridicule. Seeing all these images on screen of him walking out of our house alone in his little woolly hat being pursued by the Press, I felt so sad for him."Brand, who hosted the radio show in question, has since resigned.

However, Ross, who is reportedly paid £6 million a year, is currently serving a three-month suspension and is due to resume his chat show and Radio 2 programme next year.Mrs Sachs said: "I think Ross should have been sacked - he's a public figure with a level of responsibility and if he can't control his mouth he shouldn't be let loose."Why did the BBC keep him on? I'm sure most people don't want him there, especially on his ridiculously monstrous salary."But Ross does seem very sorry. Although he didn't apologise publicly, he sent flowers and a nice letter."She also disclosed that she had had no idea Miss Baillie, 23, was a burlesque artist in a group called the Satanic Sluts whose act involves simulating a human sacrifice and smearing themselves in blood."There are some things you'd rather not know about your grandchildren," said Mrs Sachs."It all came as a dreadful shock, Some of the images were obviously disturbing and we'd never heard of the Satanic whatevers."But she said that support came from a number of high profile comedians."David Walliams is a friend of Andrew's and we had a lovely card from him saying how the behaviour of Ross and Brand was absolutely out of bounds," said Mrs Sachs, adding that John Cleese, who starred with her husband in Fawlty Towers, had also helped."John couldn't believe it and immediately rang to sympathise," she said.

Nigella Lawson allegedly took drugs every day for a decade, court told
Nigella Lawson, 53, used cocaine, cannabis and prescription pills “daily” but kept it secret from ex-husband Charles Saatchi, a court hears Wholesome and hearty: what remains to be seen is whether NIgella’s fans will stand by her Photo: REX FEATURES	By Gordon Rayner, and Hayley Dixon

Follow Nigella Lawson is a habitual cocaine user who used her ex-husband Charles Saatchi’s money to make sure aides kept her “guilty secret” from him, a court has heard. Miss Lawson, 53, used cocaine, cannabis and prescription pills “daily” for more than a decade but kept it secret from Mr Saatchi, 70, because she knew he would “not have condoned” her behaviour, it is alleged. She had a verbal understanding with two Italian “kitchen confidantes” that they could use Mr Saatchi’s company credit card for their personal use in return for an “understanding” that they would keep quiet about her drug use, it is claimed.

Miss Lawson’s legal representatives have described the drug allegations as “totally scurrilous” and untrue. Related Articles

The claims relating to Miss Lawson’s alleged drug use came to light after her two long-standing Italian assistants, sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, were charged with defrauding Mr Saatchi out of more than £300,000 to spend on holidays, designer handbags and other items. The sisters, who worked for Miss Lawson for more than 10 years, wanted to use the “understanding” over Miss Lawson’s alleged drug use as part of their defence, and a judge ruled that the “bad character” claims could be used in court, meaning Miss Lawson can be cross-examined about them when she gives evidence in the case. Isleworth Crown Court in London heard today that Charles Saatchi had sent his ex- wife an email in which he said he believed "every word" of what the sisters said, and that he thought she had authorised their spending because she was "off her head" on drugs. At a hearing earlier this month barristers representing the Grillo sisters detailed their allegations. Nigella Lawson (CLARA MOLDEN FOR THE TELEGRAPH)
Anthony Metzer QC, representing 32-year-old Elisabetta, told the court: “The bad character application relates to Miss Lawson's alleged use of both class A and class B drugs and also her unauthorised use of prescribed drugs as a matter which is highly relevant to the defence case. “In a nutshell we submit that she had a guilty secret from her husband, her then husband. She did not want him to know of her use of cocaine and that is highly relevant to the defence case. “The defendants will maintain that they were fully aware of her illicit drug use and she essentially would consent to their expenditure on the understanding that there would be no disclosure to her husband of her usage.” The understanding between the sisters and Miss Lawson was not "verbalised,” Mr Metzer said. “There would be an understanding between them that she would be fairly liberal in relation to their substantial expenditure, largely for themselves in addition to expenditure on behalf of the children, in return for a tacit understanding.” Sisters Elisabetta 'Lisa' (left) and Francesca Grillo arriving at Isleworth Crown Court (WARREN ALLOTT FOR THE TELEGRAPH)
He said that she was “very close” to the sisters who had worked for her for many years, joining her before she was married to Mr Saatchi. He said she authorised their spending “in return for the tacit understanding that it would remain behind closed doors as to how she was incurring a substantial amount of personal expenditure on drug use”. Mr Metzer continued: “It was not her expenditure that was the concern it was what she was spending it on. “The tacit understanding was that they would not shop her to her husband or the authorities.” The sisters were arrested in August 2012 after Mr Saatchi became aware of the extent of their spending. Mr Metzer said: “When their expenditure came to light Miss Lawson was backed into a corner and had to say that she didn't consent to the expenditure because she was concerned that if she otherwise indicated that ‘I knew perfectly well and was perfectly happy’, that would lead inexorably to the disclosure to her husband and the authorities about her drug use.” He argued: “(Miss Lawson) is this enormously loved personality, she has a huge presence and that is why it is particularly relevant in this case.” Summarising the defence case Judge Robin Johnson said: “Miss Lawson is a user of class A and class B drugs on a daily basis, this was a guilty secret kept from her husband.” Jane Carpenter, for the prosecution, said: “This is a totally scurrilous account which has been raised by the defence, and the timing is no coincidence at all.” She said that despite being arrested more than a year ago and charged in March, the sisters only made the drug allegations to the court earlier this month. In the email sent on October 10 by Mr Saatchi to Miss Lawson, Mr Saatchi wrote: "Now the Grillos will get off on the basis that you were off your head on drugs and you allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked, and yes, I believe every word the Grillos said."
The judge said: "Mr Saatchi has made a further statement, and said that when he wrote the email: "When I said I believe every word I was completely astonished by the alleged scale of drug use."
But he added that there was nothing in his email that said the sisters were "given permission" to use the credit cards in the way they did. The judge said that as a result of the new evidence, "I will allow questions to be asked of Miss Lawson and other witnesses as to the alleged use of drugs and prescribed drugs."
Elisabetta and her 34-year-old sister were first employed by Miss Lawson when she was married to her first husband John Diamond, who died in 2001. They were mentioned in a dedication in a cookbook published in 2011, when Miss Lawson described them as her “kitchen confidantes”. At a hearing on November 15 the judge ruled out the "bad character" application on the basis that the evidence did not meet the “high test” required by law to introduce it. But today, after more than 100 pages of fresh evidence came to light, he reversed that decision and also lifted a contempt of court order which had until now prevented reporting of the allegations. The Grillo sisters' trial had been due to start on November 25, but the fresh material forced the judge to postpone its opening. Miss Lawson divorced Mr Saatchi in July on the grounds of his "unreasonable behaviour". The court later heard that Mr Saatchi's assistants claimed they bought copies of his books to try and boost his sales.
The sisters say that the he permitted them to use the credit cards from his company the Conarco Partnership to buy his books which include Be the Worst You Can Be: Life's Too Long for Patience and Virtue and My Name Is Charles Saatchi and I Am An Artoholic.
