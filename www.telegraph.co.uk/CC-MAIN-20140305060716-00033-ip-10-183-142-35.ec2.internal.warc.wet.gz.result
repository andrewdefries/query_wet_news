Dozens killed in Afghanistan court attack
A squad of heavily armed suicide attackers stormed a court building in western Afghanistan and triggered a day-long battle, taking hostages and leaving dozens dead or wounded.

Follow Officials said up to 53 people were killed and 91 injured in the attack on a government complex, which also housed a bank. The bulk of the dead were court clerks and civil servants who were taken hostage during the attack. Some were killed in their offices and others were herded into a basement and killed, he said. Nine men disguised in army uniform and driving military pick-up trucks approached the building in Farah province at around 8.30am. Two attackers quickly detonated their vests to try to clear a path inside and the others opened fire with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. People at the site of the attack (Reuters)
The Taliban movement claimed responsibility for attack and said the fighters were trying to free insurgent prisoners scheduled for trial at the court. Fighting carried on throughout the day and the final two assailants managed to hold out until late afternoon. Related Articles

“The Taliban took hostages from the court clerks and employees. When we finally got down to the basement, we found they had been killed.” No Nato troops were involved in the fighting, according to coalition headquarters in Kabul. Foreign troops have largely taken a back seat to Afghan troops in operations as they prepare to withdraw all combat forces by the end of next year. This summer is seen as a critical test of the strength of the Afghan forces. For the first time they will lead almost all operations and are already suffering high casualties. Around 200 policemen and soldiers died in March, when the traditional summer fighting season has yet to start in earnest. Farah borders both Iran and Helmand province and has seen security fall in recent months, police say partly because insurgents have been squeezed out of Helmand. Meanwhile, Asadullah Khalid, Afghanistan’s spy chief, returned to the country four months after he was critically wounded in his own guesthouse by a suicide bomber posing as a Taliban peace envoy.

The would-be assassin detonated explosives hidden in his underpants as the two men met, leaving Mr Khalid with severe injuries. Mr Khalid, who has proven a ruthless opponent of both the Taliban and Pakistan’s support for the insurgents, has been treated in an American hospital since the December attack. A statement from the National Directorate of Security (NDS), said: “The enemies of peace and security attacked the director of the NDS in a strike that failed and he was taken for treatment first inside and then outside the country. “Finally after around four months of treatment, with the help of God, today at around 8.30 am, he returned home with good health.”
