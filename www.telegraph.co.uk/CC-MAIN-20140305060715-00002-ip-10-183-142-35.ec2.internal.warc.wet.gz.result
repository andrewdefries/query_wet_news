There’s an easy way to keep our lights on Simply taking cost-effective energy efficiency measures could avoid the need to build 22 power stations Keep the home fires burning: the Drax coal-fired power station has cleaned up its act

Comments
It is a chilling prospect, and it is not long before it is invoked whenever voices are raised in the ever more heated energy debate. Unless a particular panacea – whether wind power, nuclear energy or shale gas – is vigorously pursued, we are told, “the lights will go out”. This week, however, the threat has seemed particularly real, following a stark warning from Alistair Buchanan, the Government’s official energy watchdog. Writing exclusively in Tuesday’s Daily Telegraph, Ofgem’s chief executive described the country’s energy security as on a “rollercoaster” about to “head downhill fast”. Within the next three years, he explained, Britain’s reserve electricity generation would shrink from its present around 14 per cent of capacity to an “uncomfortably tight” less than five per cent. This “near crisis”, as he later called it, is being precipitated by shutting down coal-fired power stations to comply with EU pollution law. Cue understandable – if predictable outrage – with one Ukip MEP, Godfrey Bloom, protesting that Europe’s “flawed and dangerous climate change agenda is stripping Britain of self-sufficiency” through the “unnecessary closure of perfectly good” facilities. But he should, perhaps, calm down a little. For a start, the closures have nothing to do with combating global warming. The cumbersomely entitled Large Combustion Plants Directive is about cutting releases of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates from power stations that are calculated to kill some 2,000 Britons a year. Adopted with full British approval, it laid down that generators should install equipment to reduce these emissions – which is precisely what many, including some in this country, did. But, perhaps generously, it also allowed plants that wanted to carry on polluting to do so, for a total of 20,000 hours between 2008 and the end of 2015. Related Articles

So it has long been known that the power stations that stuck to the dirty option would have to close within the next three years. But as coal has been cheap while the price of gas has been going up – and because the Government brings in a floor price for carbon at the start of April – operators have been burning it, in Mr Buchanan’s words, “as if it is going out of fashion”. They have deliberately used up their time ration, and thus brought forward the closures, much faster than expected. All this would make it tricky to keep the plants online to help ease the capacity crisis. That would be grossly unfair to those who invested in cleaning up their emissions so that they could go on operating after the polluting ones closed. They would be likely to secure a judicial review and, if needs be, to sue. And far from being “perfectly good”, Mr Buchanan adds, dirty plants may have “been cannibalised and driven into the ground”. Of course, if the lights really would go out without them, we would have no option – but experts discount this danger, and even Mr Buchanan says that there should not be blackouts. The energy information company IHS points out that Britain managed with similarly tight margins at the beginning of the last decade. And since then a cable link with the Netherlands has been opened, enabling us to import electricity, at a price. And that’s the point. The real threat of the capacity crisis is that it will drive up energy bills even more. And this will be made worse by the Government’s increasing reliance on gas, promoted by George Osborne even as he has restricted the growth of renewable energy. With nuclear power stubbornly failing to come onstream and offshore wind slipping back, the proportion of electricity we get from gas is likely to more than double from the present 30 per cent in just seven years, at a time when its price is expected to increase sharply. This is just the latest in a series of bungles by successive governments that have dithered in the face of a wholly predictable crisis. They have failed to plan properly, put excessive faith in nuclear power and onshore wind, neglected the need for diversity of supply and – above all – paid far too little attention to energy efficiency. And yet saving energy, as the Prime Minister said this month, provides a “huge opportunity”. By the Government’s own calculation, simply taking cost-effective measures would avoid the need to build 22 power stations, eliminating the capacity crunch. Better, as the National Grid – not exactly a radical green outfit – has reported, it could, together with an expansion of renewables, re-establish Britain as an energy exporter. And, into the bargain, it costs less and employs far more people than building new plants. Perhaps our prospects are a bit warmer, after all. Antipodeans are hopping mad about kangaroo meat Fed up with the horse meat row? Fancy kangaroo instead? Well, the greens are now at war over whether to eat it. Some are hopping mad that two million of the iconic macropods are shot each year for meat that is often marketed as “good for you and good for the environment”. Others point out that they are high in protein but low in fat, that their populations are booming, and that sustainable quotas are set by the Australian authorities. Indeed, some antipodean environmentalists have even become “kangatarians”, abstaining from any other meat. Ecologists have also suggested that it would be best to cease ranching cattle and sheep in the outback and let kangaroo numbers increase to take their place: since their soft feet do far less damage than hooves to the country’s fragile ground, they need much less water, and they emit very much less of the methane that adds to global warming. But objectors retort that they have “a social life not unlike humans” and mourn slaughtered “loved ones”. Full disclosure: I have once myself eaten kangaroo, which is exported to over 50 countries – in a West Cork village fortuitously named Leap. And I’ve yet to roo the day. The Tories are digging a hole for themselves in Eastleigh Have you been following this fascinating by‑election fracas? Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party chairman, has accused the Lib Dems of “planning to concrete over the Eastleigh countryside”, after the local council, which they control, gave planning permission on Monday for a 1,400-home development.
Yet the permission was specifically given in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) drawn up and pushed through last year by the Department for Communities and Local Government while Shapps was its housing minister. Planning officers recommended it because the council did not have the five-year supply of housing land stipulated by the NPPF, and added that as a result “it is appropriate to apply the presumption in favour of sustainable development” that lies at its heart.
Meanwhile, Mr Shapps’s candidate, Maria Hutchings, has vowed to fight housing development in the countryside. Does that make her a “hysterical, scare‑mongering, latter-day Luddite” denounced by planning minister Nick Boles, who three months ago advocated building over countryside two and a half times the size of Greater London? And why has Mr Boles not joined the team of 40 ministers and whips who have been down to campaign? Are they trying to keep him under wraps?

Hard-nosed Fed sends global markets reeling
The global bond markets and the twin havens of the yen and Swiss franc have been flashing warning signs for weeks, tracking leading indicators as they topple like dominoes. They always sniff trouble first.
The yen smashed through resistance against all major currencies on Tuesday, reaching a 15-year peak against the dollar. By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard

Wall Street and Western bourses have until now brushed aside worries that recovery in the US, Japan and southern Europe may be stalling – as have commodity markets – betting the lords of finance will come to the rescue with more liquidity if needed. Equity investors learned this week that they had misjudged the risk of a relapse as fiscal stimulus wears off, and misread the willingness of the US Federal Reserve to respond. Wrongly viewing Ben Bernanke's Fed as a soft touch, they took a fresh blast of quantitative easing for granted before it was agreed. What has emerged since the acrimonious Fed meeting on August 10 is that Bernanke was unable to marshal a consensus behind fresh QE. Seven members argued that Fed should not take such a drastic step until the economy was in serious trouble, according to Wall Street Journal Fed-watcher Jon Hilsenrath. They settled on a compromise that the Fed should roll over holdings of bonds as they reach maturity to avoid passive tightening. But there was no deal on further action. Philadelphia's Charles Plosser grumbled that the Fed had sent "a garbled message". More ominously, some Fed officials fear the central bank is already "pushing on a string" and does not have the means to revive the economy. Whether or not they are right, this comes as a psychological shock for investors schooled by the "Greenspan Put' into thinking that there is a deus ex machina in the wings. Related Articles

Market tensions have been simmering for days. They erupted on Tuesday when Japan's yen smashed through resistance against all major currencies, reaching a 15-year peak against the US dollar. The Nikkei index buckled below 9,000 as yen strength pushed Japan's export industry deeper under water. Yields on 10-year bonds fell to 0.92pc in Japan and record lows of 2.23pc in Germany and 2.88pc in the UK. They hit 2.47pc in the US, a Depression level. Irish spreads ballooned to the highest since the launch of EMU. Greek spreads neared 900 basis points, as if the EU's €110bn bail-out never happened. "This has been one of the most interesting days in finance ever," said Andrew Roberts, head of credit at RBS. "We are right at the tipping point. Yields are about to collapse even further, equities are about to turn over. The end game approaches, probably in next few weeks." In the US, the 27pc collapse in existing homes sales in July leaves no doubt that America's property market cannot stand on its own feet without the prop of homebuyer tax credits. "Home sales are in free-fall. These are truly dismal numbers," said Teunis Brosens from ING. The overhang of unsold homes has jumped from 8.9 months' supply to 12.5, higher than at any point during the Great Recession. Over 20pc of mortgage holders are already in negative equity and home default notices hit 325,000 in July. The Richmond Fed's manufacturing index showed a plunge in August expectations on Tuesday, with shipments dropping to 7 from 40 two months earlier, and the backlog of orders dropping to -1 from 22. This follows the Philly Fed's crash last week to -7. Stephen Lewis from Monument Securities said bond yields have dropped further than they did in the "flight to safety" extreme of late 2008, a sign that markets fear that underlying conditions are even worse today than they thought then. "Now they fear the global economy will remain in the mire for decades," he said. For the Japanese this has become a nightmare. Their V-shaped rebound has been cut off short of its 2008 peak. Growth stalled to just 0.1pc in the second quarter. Unemployment has been rising for four months. Yet it is their curse to have a currency that strengthens at the wrong time, pushing them deeper into deflation. The Japanese repatriate their foreign wealth in storms, driving up the yen. The dollar-yen rate hit ¥83.6 yesterday, prompting ever warnings from Toyko that intervention nears. Finance minister Yoshihiko Noda said the moves were "disorderly" and posed a threat to stability. "I am watching currencies with great interest," he said. Goldman Sachs said the yen was now overvalued by 20pc, or two "standard deviations" out of kilter. It was even more over-valued against the dollar in the mid-1990s but that is scarcely relevant. Over 60pc of Japan's rebound in exports has been driven by Asia, and only 13pc by the US. What matters is the yen rate against China's yuan. That has reached a crucifying ¥12.4. The vice grips ever deeper. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard

IAG accepts mediators plan to end Iberia labour dispute
British Airways’ parent company, International Airlines Group, has agreed a plan to limit jobs losses at its Spanish carrier, Iberia, to just over 3,100 as it seeks to end a bitter conflict with unions in Madrid.

Comments
IAG, which was created in 2011 through a merger of BA and Iberia, said its board had approved proposals put forward by Gregorio Tudela, an academic at the Autonomous University of Madrid, who was appointed by the Spanish government as a mediator in the dispute over cuts at the airline.
The plan will involve limiting job losses to 3,141, down from a proposed 3,807. Iberia staff will also be offered more favourable redundancy packages, equating to 35 days of pay for every year worked as opposed to 20 under a previous plan.
Iberia will also be allowed to push through salary cuts for remaining staff. Ground staff will have their pay cut by 7pc while pilots and flight crew will see a 14pc reduction as IAG seeks to plug losses running at €1.7m (£1.5m) a day at the airline.
Spanish unions, whose members have already staged two waves of damaging strikes, will formally announce their position on the mediator’s plan on Wednesday.
However, most of the airline unions, representing mainly cabin crew and ground staff, have said they will accept the proposal in principle.

“We are in favour of accepting the mediator’s proposal, like the majority of unions,” said Manuel Atienza, spokesman for the airline section at Spain’s second-largest union, the UGT.
The UGT will vote on the plans tomorrow before unions meet with Mr Tuleda and Iberia’s management on Wednesday.
If approved, the deal will avoid a third round of strikes next week, which are costing IAG €3m a day and would have affected many families’ Easter holiday plans.
Sepla, the traditionally combative Spanish pilots’ union, said it did not expect to finish consultations with its members for several days, but would “be glad” to attend Wednesday’s meeting.
“Sepla has always said that it is prepared to accept a plan that guarantees the future and serves some purpose,” Sepla spokeswoman Ana Serrano said.
IAG crashed €997m into the red for 2012 after Iberia racked up operating losses of €351m and the group was also forced to shoulder €545m of restructuring charges and impairments related to the Spanish airline.
By contrast BA made a €347m operating profit for 2012, the group revealed last month, leading some investors to question Mr Walsh’s decision to merge the two airlines in 2011.
However, the aviation veteran mounted a fierce defence of the deal, which handed Iberia shareholders a 44pc share of the enlarged group.
“I believe consolidation is absolutely the right way forward and I believe the fit between BA and Iberia still works,” Mr Walsh insisted at IAG’s full-year results last month.
IAG is hoping to stem cash losses at Iberia this year by reducing the carrier’s route network by 15pc.
The group as a whole is targeting an operating profit of €1.6bn by 2015.
Shares in IAG closed marginally lower at 245.5p on Monday, down 0.7p.

All major energy suppliers have now raised prices
A winter of discontent ahead unless consumers tackle their energy bills now
2:22PM GMT 18 Dec 2012
Energy price rises are in the news again and consumers who don’t act quickly to protect themselves may find they are in for a nasty shock when receiving their energy bills as the cold winter weather starts to bite. In the past few months all of the Big Six suppliers British Gas, npower, SSE, ScottishPower, EDF and most recently E.on have announced eye-watering price rises of up to 11pc. How can you protect yourself? The best way to minimise the impact of the price rises is by switching to a cheaper tariff or supplier. Many in the country are still on high-rate standard tariffs which will be hit greatest by the rises and could still see a great deal of savings through switching to an online or fixed tariff. Fixed or online? One way to insulate your household from further increases is by fixing your energy costs now. Fixed price tariffs guarantee that your bills won’t increase for a certain period of time, even if the rises come into effect. Fixed price tariffs are available across a range of suppliers and with a wide variety of end dates and options. Some even fix your prices for up to three winters. Alternatively, there are many discounted variable online tariffs that are available should you not wish to choose a fixed deal. Many of these are cheaper than fixed tariffs, however, they provide no protection should prices go up further next year. What should I be looking out for? In particular with fixed tariffs the most important thing for consumers to concern themselves with is the end date of the fixed deal. At the moment there are many cheap fixed deals extending as far ahead into the future as early 2015. This provides great reassurance for consumers as they will be protected from price hikes for three winters. The other aspect of fixed deals that consumers should be aware of are cancelation fees. Many fixed deals apply penalties should you decide to switch suppliers before the fix date expires. It is important to factor in these potential penalties when choosing a fixed plan, in case you should want to switch supplier in the future. Cheap tariffs don’t stay on the market for long It is crucial that consumers act on available deals as soon as they can, as many suppliers only offer tariffs for a limited time. In the past few months a number of suppliers have pulled the cheapest tariffs from sale. Usually this is due to high demand from consumers who are keen to snap up the cheapest deals when they go on offer. Therefore consumers cannot simply sit idle and the best advice is to switch to a cheap deal immediately. As price rises come into effect it becomes more and more likely that the cheap tariffs will disappear from the market. Many households are quickly taking stock and opting to take control of their energy costs to protect themselves this winter, if you don’t act now you may find that the best offers have already been withdrawn from the market, leaving you paying over the odds for your gas and electricity. What the experts say Mark Todd, Director of price comparison service energyhelpline.com - providers of the Telegraph Energy Switching Service, said, “The energy price rise domino effect is in full swing. Customers should turn their anger into action, switch now, save money and show that they will not take price rises lying down. Now really is the last chance saloon for securing a low cost fixed deal. “On average, a typical energy customer can save £338 per year by switching now to the cheapest internet tariff on the market and £252 a year by switching to the cheapest fixed price that will guarantee them a fixed price for the next two winters. Once the price rises come into effect, a typical energy bill will stand at £1,400 per year – the highest level in UK history.”
Act quickly and cut your costs Many households have already protected themselves from energy price rises by choosing a cheap energy deal. Using a price comparison service such as the Telegraph Energy Switching Service helps you search through all the fixed deals. The Telegraph Energy Switching Service provided by Energy Helpline takes into account your region, usage and payment method to find you the most accurate quotes.
