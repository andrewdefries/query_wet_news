Apple iPhone 5
From £529 (without contract)
Released September 21
The iPhone 5 is a marvellous piece of design, arguably the most beautiful object Apple has ever produced. It certainly stands comparison with the first iPod, the iMac and the original iPhone. Yes, it's thinner and lighter and more powerful than the iPhone 4S but to really understand it, you need to hold it in your hand. For the first time since the original iPhone, Apple's handset has an aluminium back. The iPhone 5, made with the same anodized aluminium Apple uses in its laptops, comes in either 'black and slate' or 'white and silver'. In design terms, only Nokia's new Lumias come close and while they are great designs, the flagship 920 is too big for my taste. Apple has made the iPhone 5 taller than the iPhone 4S but no wider, thankfully, in portrait orientation. That's helpful because as smartphones have gradually got bigger and wider, my hands have stubbornly remained the same size. The new display measures four inches from corner to corner, compared with the 3.5-inches of previous iPhones. Since the phone is not wider, that gives the iPhone 5 a screen resolution of 1136-by-640 pixels, compared with 960-by-640. Held in landscape orientation, the iPhone 5 screen can now display a 16:9 film without black bars at the top and bottom. Related Articles

The screen on the iPhone 4S was impressive but the new one looks better. It's brighter and the colours are richer. Initially, the extra screen size will means black bars around apps because existing iPhone apps will display at 960-by-640 until developers update them. Expect a rush of app updates starting this week. Apple's own apps give an idea of what can be done with the added space, whether that's simply making more room for the content or better spacing of menus and controls. Apple says the iPhone 5 will be up to twice as fast, thanks to its new A6 processor. Each iPhone version has been faster than the one before. The improvement is always especially striking because Apple melds its hardware and software so well that the existing generation never feels slow until you try the new one. So it is with the iPhone 5, which leaves the 4S in the dust. Starting the phone, loading apps, or taking photos - everything is faster on the iPhone 5. Benchmarking with the Geekbench app has shown that the iPhone 5 is not just faster than the iPhone 4S but it also outperforms Samsung's Galaxy S3, according to some benchmarks. Apple has refined the features of previous models for the iPhone 5. The A6 processor helps to improve camera performance. It still has eight megapixels but the iPhone 5 camera performs better in low light and captures photos more quickly. It's also possible to take a still photo while shooting video and to take 240-degree panorama photos simply by following an onscreen guide that helps you keep the phone level and move it at the right speed. The iPhone 5 has a new arrangement of microphones too, which should result in better call quality. In my tests, calls did seem a little clearer than on my iPhone 4S. With a new processor, a larger screen and an even smaller case in which to squeeze the battery, you'd be forgiven for expecting battery life to suffer in the iPhone 5 but Apple says performance has actually improved. That certainly seemed to be the case for me. Having run the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4S together over the last few days, the newer model seems slightly ahead. Probably the biggest challenge to iPhone 5 battery life will come when the handset is used on 4G. That's not something that I've been able to test since Britain's first 4G network, EE, is still some weeks away. Packing all of this into a smaller package has meant moving some things around. The new Lightning socket takes up considerably less space than the socket for the familiar 30-pin dock connector, which has been a fixture of Apple's mobile devices since the third generation iPod was introduced in 2003. That means the iPhone 5 will not fit existing accessories, such as speaker docks or chargers. Anyone who wants to use old accessories will have to pay £25 for an adaptor. Alongside the Lightning socket is the headphone socket, moved down to the bottom of the device - a change that will take some getting used to for iPhone owners when they plug in their new Apple EarPod headphones. Apple's old earbuds were so widely considered to be poor that most long-time customers discarded them immediately on unboxing the latest device. That's unlikely to be the case with the EarPods, which are a significant improvement. They sit so comfortably in the ear that you can almost forget that you are wearing them. Sound quality is much better too. Specificationists will say that with the iPhone 5 Apple is now behind its rivals in terms of features but in truth it's hard to think of a feature offered elsewhere that the average person - as opposed to the tech obsessive - really needs. NFC is not sufficiently widely used, wireless charging is nice but still requires a charger plugged into the wall and most people get along fine without removable storage. The iPhone 5 is a great smartphone made even better. It's fast, lightweight and backed by the largest application store for any device. It's also probably the most beautiful smartphone anyone has ever made. Apple

The London Underground celebrates 150 years
The London Underground turns 150 next week and an array of talks and exhibitions is planned in its honour. Could this be the year to ride it for pleasure? "The capital’s creaky and cranky Tube system has remained but a background rattle-and-hum, to the lives of Londoners and visitors alike" Photo: ALAMY	By Nigel Richardson
2:29PM GMT 03 Jan 2013
Comments
Considering how big and irksome it is, the London Underground hasn’t featured much in popular culture. Way before Oyster cards were thought of, John Betjeman wrote poems and made a television programme (Metro-land) about it. Ray Davies, in the Kinks’ Waterloo Sunset, name checked it (“Millions of people swarming like flies round Waterloo Underground”), and Julian Barnes’s book Metroland detailed suburban life at the end of the Metropolitan Line. But in general the capital’s creaky and cranky Tube system has remained but a background rattle-and-hum, to the lives of Londoners and visitors alike. This year, however, it’s taking the up escalator into the limelight. In the early afternoon of January 9, 1863, a train puffed out of Paddington station bound for Farringdon on the world’s inaugural underground railway, the Metropolitan. To allay any qualms Victorian passengers might have had about travelling underground, stations were designed to make use of natural light and carriages were brightly lit with gas lamps, the gas being stored in rubber bags on the carriage roofs. The railway was an immediate success and on its first day it carried almost 40,000 passengers. The Tube was born and London – not to mention Londoners – would never be the same again. Next week will be the 150th anniversary of this defining moment and to mark it there will be various events throughout 2013, starting with two re-creations of that first journey using an 1898 steam locomotive (early trains were steam powered until the introduction of the first electric locomotive in 1890). Railway buffs will enjoy all the hoopla but for the rest of us, for whom the Tube has just been a fact of life, it’s an opportunity to reappraise it – even, God forbid, use it for pleasure.

From that first smoky ride beneath the Marylebone Road, the London Underground has evolved into a labyrinthine network of seven deep-level tube lines and four subsurface routes processing up to four million journeys a day. Londoners use it to commute into work, visitors to dip in and out of central London as quickly possible, without giving it a second thought. But next time you sit scanning the ads for cold cures and language schools between glancing anxiously at your watch, let your eyes slip over to the Tube map. Consider its farther reaches, and promise yourself that this will be the year you go there. For the Underground, which spans 34 miles at its widest point, reaches out to some of the south-east of England’s finest open spaces – and despite the fare increases just announced, it’s still good value. For just £3.90, outside peak times, an Oyster Card will whisk you on the Metropolitan Line from Charing Cross to Amersham in Buckinghamshire for the Chiltern Hills. Epping (for the Forest) on the Central Line is even cheaper, while the Northern Line can have you on Hampstead Heath 25 minutes after boarding at Charing Cross for just £2.10. Richmond on the District Line is perfect for river strolling and shopping as well as being on the doorstep of Richmond Park. In your new-found spirit of freedom, consider another thing – that the Tube is also an aesthetic construct that tells us a lot about ourselves. Sam Mullins, the co-author of a new book on the subject aptly titled Underground, reckons that “London’s probably been more shaped by the Underground, both economically and culturally, than almost any other agency”. Mullins is the director of the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden, the main celebrant of the event it is calling LU150. Permanent exhibits – including an original steam loco – chart the history and evolution of the Underground. But, as museum officials point out, logistics tell only half the story. The Tube is also a people’s art gallery – due largely to two monosyllabic heroes of the pre-war era: Beck and Pick. Harry Beck devised the unimprovable diagrammatic map, a 20th-century design classic. Frank Pick (together with Lord Ashfield, the first chairman of London Transport) commissioned artists to create the unmistakable visual branding: preeminently, the circle-and-bar “roundel” and the clean Johnston typeface that are still copied and parodied the world over. “Pick and Ashfield laid down a real cutting-edge design that has had a huge impact on the way London looks, and thinks about itself,” Mullins said. “They had a vision for the civilising influence of public transport on London.” The artists, architects and sculptors who embellished the Underground – producing beautiful station designs, tile patterns, sculptures, light fittings, benches and poster art – were handing down a rich legacy. And this attention to detail has been swooped upon by the blogging generation, whose bulletins from the nether reaches of the Underground are becoming the 21st-century equivalent of Betjeman’s billets doux. Ian Jones, a 36-year-old web editor, blogs brilliantly at 150greatthingsabouttheunderground.com. One of his posts – on the fake houses at 23 and 24 Leinster Gardens that hide an old steam vent dating from before the full electrification of the Tube in 1905 – was viewed 100,000 times in one day. When we met for a chat and a stroll around central London stations, Jones pointed out a simple example of what inspires him: the Art Deco flourishes either side of the clock in St James’s Park station. Meanwhile, the millions who have to use it day in, day out are apt to feel less charitably disposed towards a system that can be unreliable, overcrowded and unbearably hot in summer. “Londoners have this marvellous ambivalence, don’t they, about the Tube?” said Mullins, and proceeded to imitate a commuter moaning about his latest journey. “But if someone from outside says the same thing, they’ll fight for it.”
The London Underground may be a monster, sclerotic and tangle-limbed, but it’s our monster – so say Londoners to the rest of Britain and so says Britain to the rest of the world. As it reaches a significant milestone, it would be churlish not to celebrate by buying an Oyster card to ride. Anniversary events The London Transport Museum (pictured above; 020 7379 6344; ltmuseum.co.uk), on Covent Garden Piazza (nearest tube Covent Garden), is open daily 10am-6pm except Friday (11am-6pm): adults £13.50, concessions £10, under 16s free. Keep up to speed with anniversary events through the museum’s website. The following are confirmed: January 13 and 20 Re-run of first Underground service (sold out). January 21, February 25, March 25 Three talks by the authors of Underground: How the Tube Shaped London (see What to read). February 15-October 27 Poster Art 150, a celebration of vintage London Underground advertising. April 8-12 and October 28-November 1 Behind the scenes at the London Transport Museum Depot in Acton, with talks and workshops. April 13-14 and November 2-3 Annual open weekends at the LT Depot. See the restored Metropolitan steam train. Book through the museum website.
