Anand crushes Aronian Chess world number two stunned by Indian grandmaster
By Malcolm Pein, Chess correspondent
4:38PM GMT 16 Jan 2013
Comments
Vishy Anand set the Tata Steel Tournament alight in the fourth round with a brilliancy that will be long remembered. The world champion sacrificed a rook and demolished world number two Levon Aronian in just 23 moves. The original concept was computer analysis, but Anand finished with aplomb. World number one Magnus Carlsen described the game as: “mind-blowing and really something special”. Anand joined Carlsen and Sergei Karjakin in the lead on 3/4. Following a rest day, Anand plays white against Carlsen. Opening notes: 11...a6 12.b4 a5 13.Rb1 axb4 14.axb4 Qe7 15.e4 e5 Kasparov - Kramnik, Blitz, 1998. 12.b4 c5!! 13.bxc5 Bxf3 14.gxf3 Nxc5! Topalov - Kasimdzhanov, London GP, 2012, was fine for Black. Position after 16...Nde5!!

Ghee club: Indian cooking at Cinnamon Soho Indian street cooking and home–inspired dishes are on the menu at Cinnamon Soho, the hip new sister restaurant to London's much–loved Cinnamon Club.

Comments
Why do chefs want to become chefs? Often, in the men's cases at least, it's because they think their mothers were such diabolical cooks that they feared starvation if they didn't learn to wield a saucepan for themselves. It makes one sympathise with the mothers whose culinary efforts over the years have turned out to be so thoroughly under–appreciated. One such may well be Mrs Singh, mother of Vivek, the executive chef of the Cinnamon Club in Westminster and now launching his third restaurant, in Soho. 'I never thought my mother was a brilliant cook until recently,' Singh says. 'But when we were growing up in India we didn't have a fridge; my mother was cooking four or five dishes, three times a day – that's a million odd meals in my lifetime. While I was writing my cookbook, Curry Classic and Contemporary, I began to see how much her recipes had inspired me; now I've acknowledged her influence in the restaurant menus.' His mother must be thrilled, I tell him, to have her hard work finally recognised. 'Probably she will send me a bill for royalties,' Singh replies with careful irony. So, even if his mother has been an unacknowledged influence over the years, she has clearly been a potent subconscious one, because the one thing that shines forth from Singh's menus in both the Cinnamon Club, the Cinnamon Kitchen in the City and at his newest venture, Cinnamon Soho, is a devotion to real Indian home– and street–cooking. The new menu at Cinnamon Soho has on it the exotic–sounding aubergine crush, green chilli omelette, potato paratha and paneer bhuji, while at the Cinnamon Club regular evenings were given over to resident chefs and the food of their native regions in India. It means that dinner at either venue could be fuelled by a passion for street food from Gujerat or Bengal, or Goa. Singh, who grew up in a coal–mining community 124 miles west of Calcutta, was expected to become an engineer, but surprised his family by going to hotel school instead and discovering – 'even though there had been no signs of brilliance in this direction' – that he could cook. He won a coveted place on the kitchen management programme run by Oberoi Hotels (to India what the Ritz is to Britain) and embarked on a career in food. He soon found that although he was cooking the best food in one of the best kitchens India had to offer, the experience was 'a little stifling. There was no room for change,' he says. 'We flew in wonderful food from all over the world – Angus beef from Scotland, Norwegian salmon – but we never used it in Indian cooking; the idea was that good produce was wasted in a curry. It made me fume. I was 27 and wanting to cook a new kind of Indian food and I couldn't do that in India.' To do it he had, ironically, to come to Britain. 'I knew nothing about England, but I did know what I wanted to cook.' He teamed up with Iqbal Wahhab, now at Roast, who had then recently acquired a building in Victoria, just round the corner from the Houses of Parliament. Together they launched the Cinnamon Club in 2001, home to the kind of Indian food that was unknown in this country at the time and the place to go – if you don't want to pay £250,000 for supper at No 10 – to dine alongside politicians. 'Looking back,' Singh says now, 'we were mad. The only way you can start something like the Cinnamon Club was if you had absolutely no idea of failing, no business acumen and knew nothing – so we made a success of it.' Related Articles

Now that he does know something about it, he has launched Cinnamon Soho, a very different beast to the Cinnamon Club, but one which majors in the same kind of inspirational Indian food. Whereas the Cinnamon Club is an august mix of colonial style, parquet, books and fine dining, Cinnamon Soho, just on the outskirts of Soho, in the same broad triangle that also encompasses Hix and Nopi, is all fashionable greys, teal, terracotta, orange neon strip lighting and brown Ercol–esque furniture. What persuaded him to make such a radical move? 'For the past few years, more and more people have been asking, are you a club, do I have to be a member, is there a dress code? I felt we needed to be perceived as less exclusive, but with the same quality. I didn't want to be catering exclusively for the 60–pluses; I wanted people who are younger and – dare I say it – cooler…' Cinnamon Soho certainly fits the bill. It's on the site of an old Soho drinking den and open 11am–11pm six days a week and for brunch on Sundays. It feeds into today's obsession for sharing plates, featuring tapas–style haleem, Bangla–scotch egg and burnt chilli chicken. 'It draws on my own favourite food,' Singh says. 'Burnt chilli chicken is what I generally eat late at night; haleem, made of mutton and broken wheat, is a kind of savoury porridge that you would have for breakfast in Hyderabad, bangla scotch egg is like a Bengali egg cutlet that street vendors sell on trains; ours are quail eggs rolled in spiced vegetables. But,' he adds, 'we also wanted guests to be able to have a three–course meal if that's what they felt like.' Many of these are Indian versions of English dishes: Vindaloo of ox cheek or Cumbrian lamb biryani. Keralan seafood pie is fresh fish, curry leaves and chillies in a coconut and ginger sauce under a puff pastry lid, for instance. Today, Singh is giving me some lessons in how to cook the kind of Indian food on offer in Cinnamon Soho. 'Mushrooms with cumin,' he says. 'That's a dish that comes from my travels in France. I was in Bordeaux when the ceps were in season. We had them very thickly sliced and fried in butter with parsley and lemon juice. It reminded me of the thick slices of potato fried with turmeric that my mother used to make. So I adapted it slightly. You need big, meaty mushrooms – chicken–feet mushrooms that you can get from asian supermarkets, or king oysters. Put a smear of green chutney on the toast and finish off the mushrooms with dollops of cold butter.' Several different types of kichri, or kedgeree, are made at Cinnamon Soho, including one with hot shrimp. 'It's a dish that I think people will associate with us,' Singh tells me. 'The biryani takes a bit of work, but there's nothing wrong in having an aspirational dish.' Food is very personal, he thinks, born out of the tastes and smells of home, where domestic cooks have devised endless ways of reproducing the simplest dishes. 'All mums cook potato curry differently,' he says, poring over his menu, perhaps detecting his mother's influence once again.

Pet tales: Barney, Pomeranian Barney the Pomeranian has defied vets time and again and hasn't lost his zest for life, despite his numerous health problems.
Barney has caused his owners a fortune in vet bills but his winning personality makes up for it By Amanda & Neville Hume, Sutton Coldfield
2:58PM GMT 07 Nov 2012
We have had Barney, our Pomeranian dog, since 2001 when we brought him home at eight weeks old from a breeder in Swansea. He weighed the same as a bag of sugar and looked like a tiny rabbit. He has been an utter delight ever since, but also a financial drain on us and on his insurance company.
As a one year-old he developed oedemas on both corneas and an eye specialist in Solihull said she feared he would go blind within a short time. But to everyone’s amazement, and with many visits back to the specialist – and courses of steroids, as well as homoeopathic remedies – he has kept his vision.
In midlife, he then developed alopecia, which is associated with this breed, and so no longer resembles a Pom – more a moth-eaten mongrel! The vets’ bills since we had him have come to a staggering £24,000 and we have told him that we could have had a posh car instead of him! Barney is a great character, though, and a very personable dog. He is unusual in that whenever we get his lead out he hides under the table, and he makes a most reluctant companion on our walks. Trips in the car are more his thing. He has always enjoyed barking at the neighbours’ cats and even with his diminished sight can still see well enough to spot a moggy at 20 paces. He knows the word “cat” and will even start barking if the word is used in conversation.

Liza Minnelli's dog to blame for broken leg
Liza Minnelli has broken her leg in threes place after apparently tripping over a pet dog.

Comments
The 65-year-old Cabaret star was filmed being pushed around New York City in a wheelchair after the accident. Despite her injury, Minnelli appeared cheerful, telling celebrity website TMZ: "I busted my leg in three places, so generally that calls for a wheelchair. "I tripped over my dog - of all the things, I broke my leg tripping over my dog."
On Sunday, it took two brawny men to lift the actress onto a chair at the Schmoolie & Minnooli concert, where she performed. Minnelli, who is the daughter of Wizard of Oz star Judy Garland, once joked about her constant leg ailments, say: "I like to say that on the top half I'm the daughter of Dorothy; on the bottom, I'm the daughter of Tin Man."

Now it’s a battle for the soul of David Cameron
Forget the issue of who might make a plausible new leader for the Conservative Party - the question is, can the Prime Minister reinvent himself now that the modernisation project is dead
The real battle in the Tory party is not over potential new leaders but over the evolving identity of the present one Photo: GEOFF PUGH	By Janet Daley
5:19PM GMT 16 Mar 2013
Comments
There isn’t going to be any noteworthy challenge to David Cameron’s leadership before the general election – OK? All the serious players in the Conservative Party I have talked to over the past week regard the self-appointed combatants in the latest phoney war as either risible or hopelessly precipitate. The real battle is not over who might be a plausible new leader, but over the evolving identity of the present one. So the next few months are going to be consumed not by a contest over succession but by a fight for the Prime Minister’s soul. The need for a clear, unambiguous sense of the Tories’ fundamental purpose is now universally accepted, and there is some lively betting on how successfully Mr Cameron can metamorphose into the personification of that sharper message.
Over the next two years, the Conservative Party is going to have to disengage itself not only from the blurred, deliberate ambivalence and fudge of Coalition politics, but also from the confusion created by its own insistence on reinventing itself. Not to put too fine a point on it, the modernisation project is dead. Whatever credibility might have clung to it – even after the economic crisis made its obsession with appearance over substance look like vainglorious posturing – disappeared altogether with the gay-marriage vote. Persevering with green taxes and ring-fenced overseas aid budgets may have been exasperatingly obtuse after the 2008 crash. But the expenditure of political time and energy on what looked like a politically correct semantic point must have been the final straw for a significant majority of the Right-of-centre target voters in our opinion poll today.
Downing Street shows every sign that it has learnt the lesson. Publicly, it is being admitted that ways can be found to channel overseas aid through British businesses so that it is not seen as simply a giveaway. Privately, to backbenchers on the Right, the Prime Minister has hinted that he is receptive to traditional Tory economic policies: cutting capital gains tax or a possible public-spending freeze. But this will mean extricating himself and his leadership from the mindset that modernising left behind: a vague, confused terror of “bad” headlines. For what remains of the modernising project is cowardice, a superstitious terror of phrases (“lurch to the Right”, “same old Tories”) with magical powers. So, in all his official pronouncements, Mr Cameron must pre-empt the demonic words: he is not lurching one way or the other. He is staying exactly where he is. He is not going to be swayed from his chosen course by mercurial public opinion.
In last week’s party political broadcast, he dismissed the idea that there could be any “easy answers” – as if all those who suggested remedies (such as tax cuts) to our problems must be glib simpletons. But to say that there are no “easy” answers doesn’t mean there are no answers. It is certainly true that, given the Conservatives’ starting position, reducing taxes on business, say, might not be easy in political terms. It will take some bold, courageous justification, and quite a lot of unflinching conviction. Not easy, no – but worthwhile because it is what the economy desperately needs. What Mr Cameron is trying to imply with his no-lurching, no-easy-answers talk is that all the possible courses of action that are being put forward are equally extreme, and that by disdaining all of them he is remaining moderate and reasonable. So here it is again – the ghost of the modernising project that cries out in its terrible voice from beyond the grave. In order for the Tories to be electable, it wails, they must always be on the Centre Ground – which is to say, in the strict mathematical centre of every debate.
This insistence that demands from the Right and the Left must be equally fanatical and therefore anathema to the electorate does not stand up to either logical examination or factual evidence. Far more useful and meaningful than “the centre ground” is the phrase coined by Keith Joseph, “the common ground”, with which Mr Cameron has begun, quite pointedly, to replace it. Presumably, this is wherever the great mass of the population professes itself to be. So if, for example, the overwhelming majority of voters express a desire for a harder line on immigration, or for more support for traditional families, then those positions are on the common ground of politics and deserve to be respected.

By a remarkable coincidence, an ICM poll last week showed very considerable majorities saying that adopting both those things would make the Conservatives more likely to be elected. And this was not just the view of Tory voters, but of Labour and Liberal Democrat ones as well. On immigration, 60 per cent of Labour voters and 62 per cent of Lib Dem ones thought a tougher line would help the Tories. On helping “traditional families”, the figure in favour was 62 per cent for both Labour and the Lib Dems. So where exactly is the centre (or common) ground? If you insist that being tougher on immigration and being supportive of traditional families are “extreme” positions, then you are effectively repudiating the views of the great bulk of the population. Somehow, the notion of what constitutes reasonable (non-extreme) public opinion has moved on in a way that the self‑absorbed Tory myth-makers have rather missed. In their fixation with the attitudes of 1997, they have failed to notice that the centre has walked out from under them.
Times are much harder now than they were when the Tories first decided they needed a softer image. They seem not to have noticed that people are less outraged about spending cuts (which have general support) than they are by tax rises and increases in the cost of living. Voters who do not see themselves as remotely “extreme” are particularly aggrieved by the discrepancy between what the Tories say they believe in (aspiration, personal responsibility, marriage, etc) and the effect of their taxation policies (which penalise those things). Caught between a modernising credo that now looks as out of date as an avocado bathroom, and an electorate that hungers for forceful, decisive action, they try to split the difference and lose out all around.
Lynton Crosby, a man with a gift for understanding the real common ground, has arrived on the Tory strategy team and sent the ghost of modernisation into a caterwauling frenzy. He is said to be convinced that the Tory operation needs to focus on a few clear, consistent messages that will truly resonate with voters. I’ll say. Remarkably enough, real people – as opposed to noisy activists – have sound instincts about what the country needs. They deserve political leaders who will actually address their concerns without collapsing into neurotic self-doubt. Oddly, Mr Cameron, the most verbally adroit Tory leader in a generation, may be the very man to succeed in this.

Heat brings worst smog for 10 years
By Graham Tibbetts
12:00AM BST 08 Aug 2003
The hot weather has resulted in dangerous levels of smog across the country, with London suffering its highest ozone reading since records began 10 years ago. The toxic yellow fug now hanging over many towns and cities is a cocktail of largely invisible ozone gases and exhaust fumes exacerbated by the extreme heat and sunlight. Levels of ozone - an unstable gas formed by sunlight shining on pollutants - were almost double their normal summertime levels in London on Wednesday. Scientists predicted that the hot spell would increase pollution over the coming days, with London, the South-East, the South-West and south Wales expected to be worst hit. High levels of smog can increase the likelihood of asthma, lung cancer, bronchitis, heart disease and fibrosis. Medical experts warned people with respiratory illnesses to increase their medication and avoid exercising outside. Geoff Dollard, the technical director of Netcen, the Government's independent pollution monitoring group, said: "This does seem to be a fairly extreme episode."

Joanna Yeates left half-drunk cider bottle when she disappeared
Police hunting for the killer of Joanna Yeates have revealed that the architect had purchased two bottles of cider on the night she disappeared and left one in her flat half-finished.

10:26AM GMT 29 Dec 2010
Detectives have disclosed that the 25 year-old bought the alcohol on her way home from the pub where she had been drinking with work colleagues. It is unclear whether Miss Yeates intended both bottles for herself to go with a pizza she also bought or whether she was due to meet someone else that evening. There was no trace of the meal or its packaging in the flat. Meanwhile, Miss Yeates's blue front door will be removed today so that it can be examined by forensic investigators. Police hope that it will help show whether the 25 year-old was snatched from her Bristol flat. Trace evidence of DNA, clothing fibres, hair or skin on the door could provide vital evidence. Yesterday preliminary examinations were being carried out on the blue wooden door before it is taken to a crime laboratory. Related Articles

Police still believe that a missing cheese and tomato Tesco Finest pizza could be crucial to the case. It appears on the receipt from Miss Yeates's final shopping trip but there is no trace of the pizza or the packaging in the Bristol flat. They have appealed to the public to help trace it. Detective Chief Inspector Insp Phil Jones, who is leading the murder investigation, said he believed her body had been dumped in Longwood Lane, Failand, "several days" earlier. The officer said a number of lines of inquiry were being pursued, including the possibility there was a sexual motive behind her killing or that the graduate knew her killer. He confirmed that Miss Yeates' boyfriend, Greg Reardon, who reported her missing on Sunday night after returning home from a weekend away in Sheffield visiting family, was being treated as a witness and not as a suspect. The landscape architect had been missing for eight days when her clothed body was discovered on Christmas Day by a couple walking their dogs close to the Bristol and Clifton Golf Club - about three miles from her home.

Nato plan to send more European troops to Afghanistan praised by Barack Obama Up to 5,000 more troops are to be sent by European nations to Afghanistan in a move hailed by President Barack Obama as proof of their "seriousness of purpose". Barack Obama has welcomed the extra EU troops for Afghanistan Photo: GETTY	By Patrick Hennessy in Strasbourg and Ben Farmer in Kabul 9:27AM BST 05 Apr 2009
Mr Obama said the troop pledges were a "strong down-payment on the future of our mission in Afghanistan and the future of Nato" and proof that "we've started to match real resources to achieve our goals".Under the deal clinched at the Nato summit, the extra troops and trainers - including 900 from Britain - would be used to increase security ahead of the country's presidential election this summer.Germany and Spain are among nine European countries sending more fighting forces, while France will dispatch soldiers to help train Afghan police.Between 1,400 and 2,000 mainly special forces troops from 11 countries will be formed into teams to train Afghanistan's national army, while a 300-strong team of other mentors and trainers - led by the French - will assist the police.The agreement enabled Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, to join the US President in claiming a success at the end of the two-day meeting.

However, tensions over the number of permanent troops committed to Afghanistan remain and Britain still wants other countries to do more to share the burden of fighting the Taliban.One reason for some governments' nervousness was starkly illustrated by the estimated 30,000 anti-Nato protesters who engaged in running battles with riot police, setting ablaze a hotel and two other buildings around Strasbourg's Pont de l'Europe, a bridge that links France and Germany.Police fired volleys of tear gas to try to prevent gangs of French and German protesters combining to rampage across the city.President Nicolas Sarkozy had instructed police that he did not want to see any signs of protest during events to mark Nato's 60th anniversary, but the leaders' wives including Michelle Obama and Mr Sarkozy's wife, Carla Bruni, were forced to cancel a visit to a cancer hospice because of the widespread rioting.Meanwhile in Kabul, as Nato leaders were agreeing the deal, a senior Taliban figure involved in secretive peace moves gave warning that the planned troop surge - which includes a further 17,000 US soldiers - would lead to an escalation in bloodshed.The warning came from a figure considered the moderate face of the former Taliban regime, who is expected to play a key role in paving the way for any reconciliation efforts.In an exclusive interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Mullah Abdul Salem Zaeef said the surge would only deepen the country's problems and was likely to act as a magnet to foreign jihadist fighters.It would also jeopardise a Saudi-backed peace initiative, he said.Attempts to woo moderate Taliban commanders are central to the new US strategy for Afghanistan, which was unveiled in Washington last month. Mullah Zaeef said: "All the people were optimistic when Obama became president."But when he declared the strategy, especially sending more troops and sending a military man as the ambassador, these strategies are war strategies, not a peace strategy and it's increasing the problem."He added: "The Saudis wanted to be the interpreter between the Taliban and the government and they did something, but increasing more troops is destroying this process."The 900 extra troops being sent by Britain will be a temporary addition only, officials stressed. But the US is said to want Britain's permanent force there, currently around 8,000, to be increased to 10,000, although last night Mr Brown denied that Mr Obama had directly asked him to do this.Flanked by David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary, and John Hutton, the Defence Secretary, Mr Brown said: "Burden sharing for the next few months is now a reality involving many countries who are part of the Nato alliance."This is part of a wider strategy. It is absolutely critical that there are sufficient troops there so that fair elections can take place."We are working to build a successful democratic Afghanistan and that will mean that our streets will be safer in Britain. With important presidential elections to come in the next few months, we must not allow the Taliban to disrupt the democratic process."Britain is the second biggest contributor of troops to Nato's Afghan mission after the US, whose permanent forces number around 40,000 - a figure that will be boosted to nearly 60,000 after Mr Obama's planned surge.Despite tensions over permanent numbers of troops, a topic which was not directly raised at the Nato meeting, Downing Street sources said Mr Brown had worked closely with the Mr Obama to persuade nations to join the "burden sharing" mission to cover the election.Mr Brown also revealed he had held talks with Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, to make clear his "grave concerns" over a hardline law which effectively legalises marital rape and restricts the right of women to go out without their husbands' permission.He said he had received a reassurance that a review would take place and the legislation returned to the Afghan parliament "if necessary".

Head of IMF investigated over 'improper behaviour' with subordinate The head of the International Monetary Fund is under investigation amid claims that he may have abused his position by giving preferential treatment to a subordinate with whom he was having an affair. By Tim Shipman in Washington 9:24PM BST 18 Oct 2008
The IMF hired a law firm last month to investigate Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Khan, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, following a complaint by Shakour Shalaan, the Egyptian and Arab representative on the IMF board.
The investigation will be an unwelcome distraction for the IMF, which oversees the financial markets, at a time of international economic turmoil when European governments are pushing for a drastic overhaul of its powers.
The investigation centres on a relationship Mr Strauss-Khan, who is married with six children, had earlier this year with Piroska Nagy, who is married to an Argentine-born economist, Mario Blejer.
Formerly an official in the IMF's Africa department, Ms Nagy resigned in August to take a job at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The inquiry is investigating Mr Struass-Khan's involvement in the circumstances of her departure.
A spokesman for the IMF, Masood Ahmed, said: "There was an allegation concerning improper behaviour of a personal nature on the part of the managing director.

"All allegations, particularly relating to senior management, need to be investigated."
Mr Strauss-Kahn issued a statement, saying the "incident which occurred in my private life" did not cause him to "abuse my position as the Fund's managing director".
He added: "I have cooperated and am continuing to cooperate with outside counsel to the Fund concerning this matter."
The affair, which began in January, was apparently shortlived. The inquiry is the second potential sex scandal in as many years to engulf the world's economic regulators. Paul Wolfowitz was forced to stand down as head of the World Bank last year after a long inquiry into a promotion and pay rise he arranged for his girlfriend.

'3D tape measure' for online shoppers
Online clothes shoppers will be told exactly what size is best for them using new software which combines with their webcam or smart phone to form a "3D tape measure". The result will be a more accurate sizing guide than systems based on waist size Photo: ALAMY	By Nick Collins, Science Correspondent

Scientists from Surrey University and design experts from the London College of Fashion are developing a programme which can take precise waist, hip, chest and other measurements from camera images. Using the person's height as a starting point, the software will be able to build up a 3D image and estimate their size at various different points on the body, based on their overall proportions. The result will be a more accurate sizing guide than systems based on waist size or a "small/medium/large" scale, which rely on limited measurements and the buyer's perception of their own body size. Shoppers and retailers who choose to sign up for the project could save millions of pounds a year in postage costs by eliminating the need to order multiple sizes of the same garment and send back ill-fitting clothes, researchers claimed. Prof Adrian Hilton of Surrey University said: “It’s unrealistic to expect online clothes shoppers to have the time or inclination to take a series of highly accurate body measurements of themselves. The new system makes it all very easy.”

The project, sponsored by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), is expected to be brought to market within two years. After choosing an item, the shopper will activate the software and enter their height, before in front of their webcam or smartphone in their underwear and taking a photograph. The software will not store or transmit the image to the internet, but will use it to judge the person's dimensions at various points on their body. Because label sizes vary between manufacturers, the programme will use the exact measurements of each individual garment to predict which size will be the best fit. Philip Delamore of the London College of Fashion said: "The potential benefits for the fashion industry and for shoppers are huge. Currently, it’s common for online shoppers to order two or three different sizes of the same item of clothing at the same time, as they’re unsure which one will fit best.”

Kilmarnock 1 St Mirren 1: match report
Read a match report of the Clydesdale Bank Premier League clash between Kilmarnock and St Mirren at Rugby Park on Wednesday, April 3, 2013.

Comments
St Mirren games have lately been a guarantee of entertainment and intrigue. They have successively come from behind to win the Scottish Communities League Cup, drawn with Celtic thanks to a penalty that never was, after being denied two legitimate calls, and on Wednesday night they and Kilmarnock served up a lively and absorbing contest at Rugby Park. Killie, Saints’ predecessors as League Cup winners, needed a win to all but secure their place in the top six for the SPL split but, in a first half replete with outstanding chances – theirs were missed by James Fowler and Kris Boyd – the Ayrshire side fell behind to a lancing Esmael Goncalves drive after the striker romped between Mark O’Hara and Momo Sissoko in the 36th minute. Boyd, though, was bent on adding to the 63 goals he scored in his first spell with Killie and did just that when put clear by Borja Perez immediately after the break. In pursuit of their top-six target, Kilmarnock provided a frantic finale but it came to a thwarted end when Boyd’s injury time free-kick was safely gathered by Craig Samson. Related Articles

Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere commits to club and insists Arsène Wenger is right man to turn club around
The storm clouds feel almost permanently set in above the Emirates Stadium these days but, shining brightly again amid the gloom, at least one ray of light cannot be dimmed. Fighting talk: Jack Wilshere has said Arsenal 'can get back to being the force' they once were we were with Arsène Wenger at the helm Photo: PA	By Jeremy Wilson

Jack Wilshere is back and, amid the recriminations and fall-out from Arsenal’s Capital One Cup exit against Bradford on Tuesday night, two rather important facts were overlooked.
Wilshere had not only stood up physically to the test of 120 minutes in freezing conditions just three days after his previous game, but he had also been the best player on the pitch in both matches. “We have got our young old Jack back,” noted Arsene Wenger. In truth, Arsenal have got much more than that. At this difficult time, Wilshere is a symbol of hope, optimism and ambition. A rare world-class talent who is committed to the club’s direction and still certain of its potential to regularly win trophies under Wenger. Above all, they also have a believer who is actually ready to commit his long-term future to the club. Negotiations on a new contract have been progressing well and Wilshere is poised to sign a five-year deal worth £80,000 a week. “I’m talking to the club and I probably will be committing my future to the club in the next couple of weeks,” he said. “I know the team are going through a bad spell at the moment, but that’s like any team. “We can get back to being the force we were. We’ve been in a transition stage where we’ve lost a lot of big players over the past five years and we’ve brought in some big players, but they need time to adapt. If we can stick together as a team and be united over the next few years then we can really develop into a strong team.” Related Articles

That transition began during Wilshere’s 17 months out of the team following ankle surgery. Having first been struck down at the end of a season in 2010-11 when the class of Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Alex Song came so close to winning something, he has looked on and seen the core of a vastly promising team ripped out. That must surely have been dispiriting? “Yeah, it was hard to take,” he said. “But then you see the players they’re bringing in. That makes it a lot easier to know that the club are still wanting to challenge for everything. “Over the past few years the top players have probably thought they don’t see a bright future at Arsenal but I think it’s different for them. They were a bit older than me. I’m 20, I’ve still got a long way to go, touch wood, in my career. “Players like Robin are older and maybe he thought, ‘I haven’t got time any more’. Cesc wanted to go home, which was understandable. There were many reasons why the different players left. For me, I’m young. There’s the likes of Alex Oxalde-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs, who are still really young. In the next three or four years they can become top, top players and we can challenge for everything.” With Fabregas and Van Persie gone, Wilshere is already the indisputable playing face of Arsenal and it seems inevitable that he will eventually become captain. “I’d like to one day. I’ve been here since I was nine and I know the traditions. I’m not saying I’m ready now, but one day.” When we met last week at an EA Sports Fifa 13 Ultimate Team event it was the morning after the humiliating night before in Bradford. Wilshere, though, was still measured in his analysis of what went wrong. “We knew it was going to be tough,” he said. “It’s difficult for the foreign players, especially in their first season to come here and know what Bradford away is like. Maybe you think Bradford away is going to be easy but, trust me, it’s not. It’s quicker and maybe even more intense than the Premier League. They get up to you and close you down. “If I went to Spain and we were playing a League Two side in Spain, maybe you’d think, ‘Oh, they’re not going to be that good and we’ll just win’, but no.”
Wenger, says Wilshere, was entitled to be furious after the match. “He gets angry if we don’t perform and he’s entitled to get angry and dig players out if they’re not pulling their weight.” And so is Wenger still the man to take Arsenal forward? “Every year we’ve been in the Champions League and there’s no other manager who has done that,” Wilshere said. “He’s built a legacy at this club, he changed everything. He brought the Total Football to Arsenal. “For me, there’s no question he’s the right man. When you have a few bad results I don’t think you can start blaming the manager. The players have to look at themselves. The manager puts a team on the pitch and, if the players can’t do it, it’s not the manager’s fault.” So if it is down to the players, do Arsenal have sufficient character and quality to turn things around? “There are leaders in the team and, maybe now, we need to step up and show we really are leaders.” In that regard, Wilshere says that the prospective return of “the legend” Thierry Henry would give the whole club a lift. “We have to know our season’s not over. I think we can still realistically win everything we’re in. I know we’re a long way behind in the Premier League but football changes quickly. We know in the Champions League anything can happen.” And what of 2013? Wilshere’s first priority, understandably, is to remain injury free, but his second stated wish is for Arsenal to win a first trophy for eight years. “It’s something we have to change, it’s there and it just adds to the pressure,” he said. “Maybe there’s a mental block that we need to get over and, once we get our first one, it will all start to happen. It’s too long for a club like Arsenal. We should be winning things. We’ve got good players. We used to in the past and there’s no reason we can’t in the future.” Arsenal

Stoke's Ricardo Fuller and Andy Griffin kiss spat goodbye
Stoke manager Tony Pulis has claimed that Ricardo Fuller and Andy Griffin have “kissed and made up” in the wake of their contretemps at West Ham last Sunday.

Comments
Fuller was sent off for slapping his captain after the pair had a heated exchange in the aftermath of the home team’s equaliser early in the second half.
But Pulis said the grievance had been sorted out at a team meeting on New Year’s Eve and declared that it was time to move on.
He said: “Ric and Griff have apologised to one another and to the group as a whole. They have also been punished in-house and it’s over and done with.
“We had a really good meeting with everyone having their say and, as I’ve said many times before, we’ve got a smashing group of lads here. There isn’t one bad egg among them.
“The incident was disappointing in lots of respects and we can’t deny that. But everyone makes mistakes and you have to learn from them and get on with life. They’re both committed players with passion, but on this occasion the passion flowed over.
“Unfortunately, we also went on to lose a game we would probably have got at least a point from if we’d kept 11 men on the field. To add to that, we’ll have to do without Ric, who has been suspended for the next three games.”
There have been suggestions that Fuller could be sold as a consequence of the flashpoint, but Pulis said: “That’s absolute nonsense.
“People can construe what they want, but Ric and Griff had an argument and it has now been sorted. They’ve kissed and made up.
“Ric has 2½ years left on his contract and he’s going nowhere. All the talk about sacking him or selling him, or this and that, is a load of rubbish.
“I get on very well with Ric and he’s a smashing lad. He has his moments, but so does everyone else. He’s also a great talent and an important player at this football club.”
Pulis had nothing to report on the transfer front as he prepared his injury-hit squad for tomorrow’s FA Cup third-round tie at Hartlepool.
He does expect to spend millions this month to boost Stoke’s bid to avoid relegation, but said: “There’s nothing imminent.
“We’ve identified a number of targets and there’s work going on behind the scenes to see if the players we want are available, and to see if we can afford them. There’s no chance of us paying over the odds for players, but we’re desperately trying to get a few in to help us.
“The players we have are also hoping we can bring some in to give us a boost, but for the moment I’m concentrating on preparing the team for an important FA Cup tie at Hartlepool.”

Sean Kelly dominated the race throughout the 1980s when the popular Irishman won a record seven successive titles. The first big race of the season provides European cycling fans their first glimpse of the world's best riders on the open roads, while giving directeur sportifs an indication of the season ahead. The race is organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) who also run the Tour de France, Paris-Roubaix, Flèche Wallonne, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Critérium du Dauphiné, and now also own a large share of the Vuelta a España.

The Tirreno-Adriatico is considered by many as ideal preparation for Milan-Sanremo, the first one-day classic, or monument, of the season. Wildcard entries: Androni-Giocattoli (Ita), MTN-Qhubeka (SA), IAM Cycling (Swi), NetApp-Endura (Ger). Tirreno-Adriatico route March 12, stage one: Donoratico - San Vincenzo; team time trial, 16.9km

The late Tom Simpson became the first British rider to win the Milan-Sanremo when, in 1964, he outwitted France's Raymond Poulidor on the final Poggio climb before claiming his first 'monument' of cycling. Cavendish became the second Briton to have a Milan-Sanremo on his palmarès (list of victories) after outsprinting Heinrich Haussler to the line in 2009. Unsurprisingly, the Italians have dominated the race since its inception in 1907 where they have won 50 of the 104 races. Despite their domination of the race, Filippo Pozzato was the last Italian to have triumphed in Sanremo (2006). Last year's race saw a little bit of cycling history made as Songezo Jim became the first black African rider to compete in a WorldTour event while MTN-Qhubeka team-mate Gerald Ciolek prevailed in horrible conditions to win a memorable race. Wildcard entries: Androni-Giocattoli (Ita), Bardiani-CSF (Ita), IAM Cycling (Swi), MTN-Qhubeka (SA), NetApp-Endura (Ger), UnitedHealthcare (US), Yellow-Fluo (Ita) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indeed, Spaniards have claimed 57 titles - including Mariano Cañardo, who won seven titles between 1928 and 1939 despite the race being cancelled for two years at the height of the Spanish Civil War. Tour of Catalunya route March 24, stage one: Calella - Calella, 170km
March 25, stage two: Mataro - Girona, 168km
March 26, stage three: Banyoles - La Molina, 163km

E3 Harelbeke: March 28
Last year's winner: Fabian Cancellara (Swi)
Most wins: 5 Tom Boonen (Bel) Though Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Dwars door Vlaanderen, Ghent-Wevelgem, Tour of Flanders, Grote Scheldeprijs and Brabantse Pijl make up the sextet of races that make up the Flanders classics, the E3 Harelbeke is the first Flandrian WorldTour race in what is a huge week for Belgian cycling. The race, which started in 1958, is in fact named after a motorway, the E3 which has since been renamed. Tom Boonen (Bel) remains the race's most successful rider having won it five times while compatriot Rik Van Looy won the race on four occasions (1964, 1965, 1966 and 1969). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ghent-Wevelgem: March 30
Last year's winner: Peter Sagan (Svk)
Most wins: 3 Robert Van Eenaeme (Bel); 1936, 1937, 1945. Rik Van Looy (Bel); 1956, 1957, 1962. Eddy Merckx (Bel); 1967, 1970, 1973. Mario Cipollini (Ita); 1992, 1993, 2002. Tom Boonen (Bel); 2004, 2001, 2012. As the WorldTour heads north for the Ghent-Wevelgem, riders' endurance will be tested by the famously harsh Belgian wind and rain. That said, the race, due to the flat finish, is considered a sprinters' classic. Indeed, Mario Cipollini, the colourful Italian, won a record-equalling three titles alongside Robert Van Eenaeme (Bel), Rik Van Looy (Bel) and the greatest of all, Eddy Merckx (Bel) before he was joined by Tom Boonen (Bel) in 2012. Should Boonen, one of the greatest classics riders of all time, produce a repeat of 2012's incredible form then the poster-boy of Belgian cycling could eclipse all four. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tour of Flanders: April 4
Last year's winner: Fabian Cancellara (Swi)
Most wins: 3 Achiel Buysse (Bel); 1940, 1941, 1943. Fiorenzo Magni (Ita); 1949, 1950, 1951. Eric Leman (Bel); 1970, 1972, 1973. Johan Museeuw (Bel) 1993, 1995, 1998, Tom Boonen (Bel) 2005, 2006, 2012. Cycling has a tradition of its races being created by newspaper owners, or editors, as a means of increasing circulation. And the Tour of Flanders was set up by Karel Van Wijnendaele, of Sportwereld back in 1913. The race itself, the second 'monumen't of cycling, originally departed from Ghent, the 'home' of Belgian cycling, though, over the years its route has changed. A tough ride that even Merckx struggled to win. So tough that only two riders have won successive titles. Simpson, in 1961, claimed his first major race here, perhaps thanks to Ghent's talismanic Albert Beurick who took the popular Briton under his wing during his time in Belgium. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tour of the Basque Country: April 7-12
Last year's winner: Nairo Quintana (Col)
Most wins: 4 José Antonio Gonzalez (Spa) 1972, 1975, 1977, 1978 The Tour of the Basque Country is a six-day stage race in the mountainous region of northern Spain. Over the years, due to its terrain, the race has been dominated by climbers. Tour of the Basque Country route: to be confirmed
The jerseys: general classification (overall lead): yellow; points classification: white; king of the mountains classification: red; sprints classification: blue. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paris-Roubaix: April 13
Last year's winner: Fabian Cancellara (Swi)
Most wins: 4 Roger De Vlaeminck (Bel); 1972, 1974, 1975, 1977, Tom Boonen (Bel) 2005, 2008, 2009, 2012 Paris-Roubaix is the third one-day classic of the season and possibly one of the most unique races in world cycling due to the extensive sections of pavé, or cobblestones, that makes The Hell of the North such a lottery of luck and bravery. Despite its title, the race no longer departs from the French capital - in 1968 organisers moved the start line from Paris to the town of Compiègne, around 60km north. Unsurprisingly, Paris-Roubaix had been dominated by the Belgians who have won 55 of the 111 editions. France has had 28 victories. The first English speaking rider to have triumphed across the cobbles was Ireland's Sean Kelly (1984, 1986), while the only other English speaking rider to have prevailed is Australia's Stuart O'Grady. Tom Boonen, the 2012 winner, can leapfrog compatriot Roger De Vlaeminick to become the most decorated Paris-Roubaix champion of all time should he claim a fifth title in April though Fabian Cancellara's, last year's winner, will be hoping to match Boonen and De Vlaeminck. Wildcard entries: Bretagne-Séché Environnement (Fra), Cofidis, Solutions Crédits (Fra), IAM Cycling (Swi), NetApp-Endura (Ger), Topsport Vlaanderen-Baloise (Bel), UnitedHealthcare (US), Wanty-Groupe Gobert (Bel). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amstel Gold Race: April 20
Last year's winner: Roman Kreuziger (Cze)
Most wins: 5 Jan Raas (Hol); 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1982 Known for its numerous short-sharp climbs, including the 12 per cent Cauberg, that pepper the circuitous, often confusing, route, the Amstel Gold is the most prestigious Dutch road race. Though relatively young - founded in 1966 - no individual has won successive races since Jan Raas, the then world champion and multiple classics winner, retained his title 30 years ago in 1980. The Amstel Gold is the first of three one-dayers that make up the triumvirate of races, alongside La Flèche Wallonne and Liège-Bastogne-Liège, that form the prestigious Ardennes classics. Only two riders - Italy's Davide Rebellin (2004) and Philippe Gilbert of Belgium (2011) have ever completed the hat-trick in the same season. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
La Flèche Wallonne: April 23
Last year's winner: Daniel Moreno (Spa)
Most wins: 3 Marcel Kint (Bel); 1943, 1944, 1945. Eddy Merckx (Bel); 1967, 1970, 1972. Moreno Argentin (Ita); 1990, 1991, 1994. Davide Rebellin (Ita); 2004, 2007, 2009 Just three days after the Amstel Gold, riders will contest La Flèche Wallonne - a midweek one-day race in the Walloon region of Belgium. Raced around a circuit, La Flèche Wallonne includes several short, but steep climbs - some at almost 15 per cent - including the Mur de Huy where the passionate Belgian cycling fanatics line the narrow, steep banked roads, to create a wall of beer-fuelled noise where, after three laps, the winner will claim the Walloon Arrow. Wildcard entries: Cofidis, Solutions Crédits (Fra), Colombia (Col), IAM Cycling (Swi), MTN-Qhubeka (SA), Topsport Vlaanderen-Baloise (Bel), UnitedHealthcare (US), Wanty-Groupe Gobert (Bel). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Liège-Bastogne-Liège: April 27
Last year's winner: Dan Martin (Ire)
Most wins: 5 Eddy Merckx (Bel); 1969, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975 Liège-Bastogne-Liège, the second one-day race in the Ardennes region within days, is the fourth 'monument' of the season and the oldest of all - La Doyenne - having started in 1892. As the name suggests, the race starts in the town of Liège in eastern Belgium and heads almost 100km south before returning via a longer route that includes climbs such as Stockeu, Haute-Levée, La Redoute, Saint-Nicolas and the Col de Forges. The race has, over the years, been dominated by Belgians who have won 59 of the 99 editions of the race. Wildcard entries: Cofidis, Solutions Crédits (Fra), Colombia (Col), IAM Cycling (Swi), MTN-Qhubeka (SA), NetApp-Endura (Ger), Topsport Vlaanderen-Baloise (Bel), Wanty-Groupe Gobert (Bel). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tour of Romandy: April 29-May 4
Last year's winner: Chris Froome (GB)
Most wins: 3 Stephen Roche (Ire); 1983, 1984, 1987 A six-day stage race that started just two years after the end of Second World War, in 1947, as Swiss Cycling, the governing body for cycling in Switzerland, celebrated its 50th anniversary. Staged just one week before the first grand tour of the season, the Tour of Romandy (Tour de Romandie) is ideal preparation for the Giro d'Italia. In 2012 Bradley Wiggins became the first Briton to win the race in the build-up to his Tour de France triumph before team-mate Chris Froome emulated him last year en route to winning the centennial Tour in July. Ireland's Stephen Roche won the title three times, including the 1987 edition - Roche's crowning season when he claimed the Triple Crown of the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Road Race World Championship. Tour of Romandy route April 29, prologue: Ascona, individual time trial, 5.6km
April 30, stage one: Ascona - Sion, 203km

Giro d'Italia: May 9-June 1
Last year's winner: Vincenzo Nibali (Ita)
Most wins: 5 Alfredo Binda (Ita); 1925, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1933. Fausto Coppi (Ita); 1940, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953. Eddy Merckx (Bel); 1968, 1970, 1972, 1973, 1974. The Giro d'Italia, or corsa rosa, is the first of three grand tours - the others being the Tour de France and Vuelta a España - that mark the highlights of the season for stage-race specialists. Unsurprisingly, Italian riders have dominated the podium places since its inception in 1909. Three - Alfredo Binda (Ita), Fausto Coppi (Ita) and Eddy Merckx (Bel) are the race's most dominant riders having won the overall general classification five times apiece. The 2012 winner Ryder Hesjedal, while becoming the first Canadian to win a grand tour, was just the third English speaking rider to have prevailed in the Giro d'Italia. Stephen Roche of Ireland was the first in 1987, while a year later America's Andy Hampsten joined him. The overall leader in the general classification wears the pink jersey, or maglia rosa, the colour of the pages of La Gazzetta dello Sport, the Italian daily sports newspaper that founded the race and remains its main sponsor to the day. The leader in the points classification wears a red jersey (maglia rosso passione); the leader in the mountains wears blue (maglia blu) and the leading young rider, like in the Tour de France, wears white (maglia bianca). Wildcard entries: Androni-Giocattoli (Ita), Bardiani-CSF (Ita), Colombia (Col), Yellow-Fluo (Ita). Giro d'Italia route May 9, stage one: Belfast - Belfast; team time trial, 21.7km

Last year's winner: Chris Froome (GB)
Most wins: 3 Nello Lauredi (Fra); 1950, 1951, 1954. Luis Ocaña (Spa); 1970, 1972, 1973. Bernard Hinault (Fra); 1976, 1977, 1981. Charly Mottet (Fra); 1987, 1989, 1992 France's penultimate WorldTour stage race of the season is raced over eight days in the southeastern province Dauphiné as preparation for the big one three weeks later - the Tour de France. Indeed, all of the top Tour riders over the years have won the Critérium du Dauphiné during their careers, including the four riders who have claimed five Tours; Jacques Anquetil (Fra), Eddy Merckx (Bel), Bernard Hinault (Fra) and Miguel Indurain (Spa). The race was founded by the proprietors of Dauphiné Libéré, the local newspaper. However, in Jan 2010 they passed the rights over to ASO as they turned their concentrations to publishing while the race name was shortened from Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. In 2013 Chris Froome became the fourth Briton to win the race following Brian Robinson (1961), Robert Millar (1990) and Bradley Wiggins (2011 and 2012). Critérium du Dauphiné route

Most wins: 2 Tyler Farrar (US); 2009, 2010 The Vattenfall Cyclassics is a one-day race in and around the city of Hamburg in northern Germany and the second youngest of the European WorldTour races. Founded in 1996, the Vattenfall Cyclassics has yet to attract a dominant force and has had different winners in each edition of the race - although six Italians have triumphed. After joining the ProTour in 2005 the race changed its name from HEW Cyclassics after the local electricity company that sponsored it was, itself, rebranded. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GP Ouest France: August 31
Last year's winner: Filippo Pozzato (Ita)
Most wins: 2 Philippe Bono (Fra) 1932, 1933, Eloi Tassin (Fra) 1945, 1948, Jean Gainche (Fra) 1958, 1962, Fernand Picot (Fra) 1961, 1963, Jean Jourden (Fra) 1968, 1969, Jacques Bossis (Fra) 1976, 1977, Gilbert Duclos-Lasalle (Fra) 1981, 1987 The GP Ouest-France, previously known as Grand-Prix de Plouay Ouest-France, is a one-day race near the village of Plouay in Brittany, north-west France.

The race was started in 1931, however, it took until 1979 for the French monoploy to be broken - Frits Pirard of Holland. Britain's Jeremy Hunt claimed the title in 2002. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tour of Lombardy: Oct 5
Last year's winner: Joaquim Rodríguez (Spa)
Most wins: 5 Fausto Coppi (Ita); 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1954 The Tour of Lombardy (Giro di Lombardia), or Race of the Falling Leaves, is the last European race of the WorldTour season and final 'monument' of a long season. This year's classic around northern Italy will be contested for the 108th time and, unsurprisingly, has been dominated by Italians who have won 67 times since its first edition in 1905. Henri Pelissier (Fra) and Sean Kelly (Ire) are the only non-Italians to have three Tours of Lombardy on their palmarès. Following the introduction of the Tour of Beijing to the race calendar the Tour of Lombardy was brought forward by a fortnight to accommodate cycling's expansion into Asia. Wildcard entries: Androni-Giocattoli (Ita), Bardiani-CSF (Ita), Caja Rural-Seguros RGA (Spa), Colombia (Col), IAM Cycling (Swi), Net App-Endura (Ger), Yellow Fluo (Ita) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tour of Beijing: Oct 10-14
Last year's winner: Beñat Intxausti (Spa)
Most wins: 2 Tony Martin (Ger) 2011, 2012. The first edition of the Tour of Beijing took place in 2011 as the International Cycling Union looked to globalise the popularity of the sport. Following its launch many cycling traditionalists were angered when the race replaced the Tour of Lombardy as the final race of the season. Germany's Tony Martin won the opening two editions of the race before Beñat Intxausti ended his winning run last season. Tour of Beijing route: to be confirmed

Agfa Photo Frame
£34; pcworld.co.uk
Digital photoframes have been cited unjustly in surveys as the season’s least-wanted gift. In fact they offer an easy way to get your pictures off that digital camera and into the real world.
Arcam Solo Mini
£600; Richer Sounds
Unusually, this offer is only available in-store, but it’s well worth making the trip to Richer Sounds. The Arcam Solo Mini is one of the best compact hi-fi systems on the market. Speakers, as usual, are not included.

Wonders of the World: Machu Picchu, Peru
The ancient city of Machu Picchu, hidden away in the Andes, is best seen at sunrise, writes Emily Craig. 8:00AM GMT 27 Dec 2009
Comments
The magnificently isolated site of Machu Picchu, the ancient Inca city, was unknown to outsiders until 1911, when the US explorer Hiram Bingham discovered the site. It was built by the Incas in the 15th century, who chose to locate it on a saddle of land overshadowed by snow-capped summits. Zigzagging steps and terraces connect the buildings, and drainage channels were built to protect the foundations and to prevent the city’s collapse. At an altitude of 2,353 metres, the city offers spectacular views down into the valley below. Sunrise is the most atmospheric time to visit the site. Although it is possible to approach the city by road and then walk to the gate, by far the best way to view Machu Picchu is to hike along the Inca Trail or board a train at Cuzco. The narrow gauge railway meanders along the valley at a gentle pace and visitors may choose from a number of options to suit their budget, ranging from the Backpacker Shuttle to the Hiram Bingham luxury train. The site is open daily from 6.30am-5pm. The standard entry fee is approximately £27 for adults and £13 for students. Journey Latin America (www.journeylatinamerica.co.uk) offers nine-day trips to Peru; the tour incorporates a full-day excursion to Machu Picchu with overnight accommodation in the nearby village of Machu Picchu Pueblo.
