12:01AM GMT 12 Jan 2007
Ruth Kelly has had a wretched week but today she deserves our gratitude. As education secretary she took the courageous decision to insist that GCSE results reveal the proportion of pupils gaining five or more passes that include maths and English. As a result, school league tables are, for the first time, honest and the gulf between the rhetoric and reality has been exposed. Schools, under relentless pressure to hit targets, played the system for all it is worth, encouraging less able students to take "soft" (i.e. easy) subjects. Now the truth has been laid bare — painfully so in some cases. The overall figures are shocking: fewer than half of all pupils left school last year with five or more GCSEs that included English and maths. At last we have an explanation of why the ever-climbing exam pass rates which ministers flaunt are not matched by the experience of employers who struggle to find literate, numerate employees. This is a shameful failure of policy by a Government that has never stopped trumpeting its commitment to education.

Russia ‘printing money for Syria’ claims report
Russia is printing bank notes and sending them by the plane load to Syria to help the besieged regime pay its soldiers and civil servants, a new report suggests. A Syrian five pound note Photo: ALAMY	By Alex Spillius
6:42PM GMT 26 Nov 2012
Follow Flight records obtained by the investigative website ProPublica showed that at least 120 and up to 240 tons of bank notes were delivered during a ten-week period between July and September.
On eight round-trip trips between Moscow’s Vnukovo airport and Damascus international airport, the “Type of Cargo” is listed as “Bank – Notes (30 Ton)”. Neither their denomination nor value was specified however.
Seven of the eight Syria Air flights were confirmed through international plane-tracking services, photographs from amateur plane-spotters and official air traffic control records. Each manifest detailed a circuitous route over Iran and Iraq, countries that are friendly to the Syrian regime, rather than the most direct route over Turkey, which has become a foe of President Bashar al-Assad.
The deliveries appear to have softened the damage caused to the Syrian regime by stiff European sanctions, which among other things annulled an agreement with an Austrian bank that had previously printed the Syrian pound. Related Articles

The EU has passed 19 rounds of sanctions against the regime since pro-democracy protests in March 2011 descended into a civil war that has claimed an estimated 40,000 lives.
Russia has been Mr Assad’s key international ally throughout, blocking punitive resolutions in the UN Security Council on three occasions. In the summer, it was reported that Russia had begun printing Syrian pounds and had already delivered its first shipment, while Damascus-based bankers said that new bank notes printed in Russia were circulating in trial amounts in the capital and Aleppo, the commercial capital.
Such reports were denied by the Syrian Central Bank, but in August the official Syrian news agency, Sana, quoted Syrian officials on a visit to Moscow as saying that Russia was printing money for Damascus.
Ibrahim Saif of the Carnegie Middle East Centre said that 30 tons of bank notes was a significant amount for a country of Syria’s size. “I truly believe they are printing money because they need new notes. Most of the government revenue that comes from taxes, in terms of other services, it’s almost now dried up. But, he added, “they continue to pay salaries”. “They have not shown any signs of weakness in fulfilling their domestic obligations. The only way they can do this is to get some sort of cash in the market.”
