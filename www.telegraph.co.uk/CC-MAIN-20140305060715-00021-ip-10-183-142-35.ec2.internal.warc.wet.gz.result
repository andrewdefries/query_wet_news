'Eric Morecambe? He'd be funny if he ditched Ernie Wise'
BBC comedy producer predicted Eric Morecambe would only find success "if he could be detached from Ernie Wise", according to a letter from the archives.

Comments
Eric Morecambe would only make it in comedy if he ditched Ernie Wise and went solo - the verdict of a BBC executive who laughed off the idea of them becoming television stars.
A letter unearthed in the BBC archives reveals that Wise was considered the weak link in the comedy pairing.
It was written in 1959 by John Ammonds, a producer who had seen them on stage and worked with them on radio broadcasts.
At the time, Morecambe and Wise had made one short-lived TV show for the BBC, Running Wild, which was panned by critics when it was broadcast in 1954.
“After seeing Morecambe and Wise the other week in their show [in] Blackpool, I am not at all sure as to their strength on a TV programme,” Ammonds wrote to a scriptwriter friend.

“They are still working to old gags and, in my opinion, frequently working the wrong type of material. They are quite a disappointment to me because when I first worked with them in this region on sound, I thought they had a great future.
“It is even more depressing than it seems because they are quite happy to jog along as they are doing at the moment.
“I always thought Eric Morecambe was a funny man and still think that he could be very successful on vision but only if he could be detached from Ernie, who I think is a big weakness.
“I really cannot see them making the grade in a TV series.”
The letter, reprinted in the Mail on Sunday, is dated June 5 1959.
Two years later, Morecambe and Wise found success on commercial television with an ATV series, Two Of A Kind, which ran from 1961-1968.
In 1968, they transferred to the BBC with The Morecambe and Wise Show - where their producer was John Ammonds.
It was Ammonds who came up with the dance with which Eric and Ernie closed the show, which drew audiences of over 20 million for its Christmas specials and turned the pair into national treasures.

Tough rhetoric over 'bogus students threatening UK universities'
Ministers were last night accused of harming the reputation of British universities over their increasingly tough rhetoric on student immigration.

6:30AM GMT 09 Jan 2013
Follow Comments linked with an announcement on a new “bogus students” crackdown threatened the country’s multi-billion university sector, according to group that represents British universities. They suggested that overseas students were no longer welcome and were potentially deterring thousands of the best minds from studying in Britain, who were instead choosing to visit North America or Australia, it was claimed. Last month Theresa May, the Home Secretary, announced that consular staff would interview more than 100,000 prospective students in an attempt to prevent bogus applicants entering the country. "We are concerned about the language and the atmosphere that is being created, not least because it plays very, very badly internationally," said Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK. "Whatever the intentions of the politicians are … every time these sorts of comments are made by the home secretary or others it does have a potentially very damaging impact internationally.

""What universities are reporting to us [is that] they are seeing significant drops, particularly from India, from Pakistan and now from China and Saudi Arabia."
She added to the Guardian: "These are countries that send large numbers and also they are important countries in terms of international engagement and industry engagement, so we want to be promoting and fostering relations with them, not erecting barriers."
According to the latest figures from Ucas and the Office for National Statistics suggest a slowdown in the number of non-EU undergraduate students applying to study in Britain. Since 2007, applications have risen by an average of almost seven per cent a year. Ucas's January figures will be released shortly but preliminary statistics show an increase of just 0.8 per cent. ONS figures released in November showed a 26 per cent fall in the number of visas issued for the purposes of study in the year to September 2012. Last night Mark Harper, the immigration minister, said that international students made an "important contribution" to the economy. "The UK's education system is one of the best in the world but to maintain this reputation it is vital that we tackle the abuse of the student route, while making sure Britain remains open for business," he said. "Too many institutions were selling immigration not education and since we have tightened our rules over 500 colleges have lost the ability to bring in international students."

Conservative Party Conference: forces budget will fall below Nato minimum Britain's defence budget is likely to fall below the Nato minimum as a result of spending cuts, William Hague has admitted.
William Hague said that, once the costs of the Afghanistan operation were included, defence spending would 'get back pretty much' to 2 per cent Photo: AFP/GETTY	By James Kirkup 9:00AM BST 07 Oct 2010
It could be less than 2 per cent of gross domestic product, the minimum that alliance members are asked to spend on their militaries, the Foreign Secretary said.
Britain is one of just a handful of Nato members that meet the standard, but defence officials believe spending could fall as low as 1.7 per cent.
The United States routinely spends more than 4 per cent on defence and its officials have expressed fears about Britain's future ability to work with US forces. But Mr Hague told Radio 4: "When you face a financial crisis of this magnitude such figures are not sacrosanct."
He said that, once the costs of the Afghanistan operation were included, defence spending would "get back pretty much" to 2 per cent.
Mr Hague is a member of the National Security Council, which will start deciding today which major projects will be scrapped as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review. Despite growing signs that the Treasury will water down its initial demand to cut the defence budget by a tenth, the Armed Forces still face the loss of some capabilities.

The meeting is likely to decide the fate of the Navy's £5.2 billion plan for two aircraft carriers, with insiders predicting that one will be cancelled. Senior Navy commanders have accused the Army of underhand tactics during the review.
They claim a "black ops" unit, headed by a colonel and a lieutenant colonel, has been briefing politicians and civil servants secretly to promote the Army's interests. "We will not forgive and we will never forget," a senior naval officer said. Conservative

In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph before the publication of a landmark report into religious discrimination over the last decade, he attacks "fashionable" views mocking and marginalising religion and say his Equality and Human Rights Commission will stand up for believers.
But he also warns religious groups of the danger of extremism, saying some Christian activists are not fighting for their religion but for political influence - and says that his own background as the son of immigrants from Guyana means he fears "undiluted" attitudes to homosexuality risk Afro-Carribean communities not integrating into the mainstream.
FASHIONABLE ATHEISM
Mr Phillips today becomes one of the first and most high-profile figures in public life to warn people of faith feel "under siege" from "fashionable" anti-religious views - which he admitted the Equality and Human Rights Commission had been wrongly identified with.

'Muslims are integrating better than Christians'

"The thing I've become anxious about in recent times is this – there is certainly a feeling amongst some people of belief that they are under siege, that they are often disadvantaged, that they are looked at and considered in some way different and their faith makes them less worthy of regard," he said.
"There is a view that says religion is a private matter and it's entirely a choice. I think that's entirely not right. "Faith identity is part of what makes life richer and more meaningful for the individual. It is a fundamental part of what makes some societies better than others in my view.
"I understand why a lot of people in faith groups feel a bit under siege. They're in a world where there are a lot of very clever people who have a lot of access to the airwaves and write endlessly in the newspapers knocking religion and mocking God. The people who want to drive religion underground are much more active, much more vocal. There is no doubt there's quite a lot of intolerance towards people of faith and towards belief.
"There's a great deal of polemic which is anti-religious, which is quite fashionable. People can sometimes think we're part of that fashionable mocking and knocking brigade. We're not that."
STANDING UP FOR BELIEVERS
The equality watchdog chairman said it would support believers who suffer discrimination because of their faith, and conceded there was a perception it had not done so in the past.
"That is slap bang in the middle of our anti-discriminatory work," he said.
"Being an Anglican, being a Muslim or being a Methodist or being a Jew is just as much part of your identity and you should not be penalised or treated in a discriminatory way because of that. That's part of the settlement of a liberal democracy.
"Our business is defending the believer. The law we're here to implement recognises that religious identity is an essential part of this society. It's an essential element of being a fulfilled human being.
"My real worry is that there are people who may well feel they're being treated unfairly because of their faith and who actually in fact may be being treated unfairly because of their faith but for some reason feel they can't get our support in getting justice."
WARNING TO CHURCHES ON CHAIRTY
The quid pro quo for standing up for individual believers is that churches and faith groups have to fall into line with the views of wider society to keep their charitable status, Mr Phillips signalled.
"Churches, mosques, temples, religious organisations of all kinds now have to some extent protection under the law but they also have to obey the law including anti-discrimination law because they are charities, because they offer a public service," he said.
"People are being confused about the right of the individual to freedom of conscience and freedom of expression and the freedoms of particular institutions or organisations. "Nobody is going to say that its OK for a Muslim community to apply in isolation and override the view of the civil courts that says a woman's testimony is worth less than a man's."
Mr Phillips says that the refusal to allow Catholic adoption agencies an exemption from laws stating homosexual couples could not be discriminated against was even more clear cut.
"Catholic care was a clearer and simpler case. You're offering a public service and you're a charity and there are rules about how charities behave. You have to play by the rules. We can't have a set of rules that apply to one group of people simply because they happen to think it's right." NO POLITICS BEYOND CHURCH DOOR
Equality laws should not impinge on the way that religious institutions are run, Mr Phillips said - meaning gay bishops and women priests are not a matter for his watchdog.
"It's perfectly fair that you can't be a Roman Catholic priest unless you're a man," he said.
"It seems right that the reach of anti-discriminatory law should stop at the door of the church or mosque.
"At the moment the law says it [appointing openly gay bishops] is a matter for the Church of England. It's probably right.
"I'm not keen on the idea of a church run by the state. I don't think the law should run to telling churches how they should conduct their own affairs."
POLITICAL CHRISTIANS
A string of high-profile legal cases involving Christians who feel discriminated against because of objections to homosexuality may be fuelled by evangelical activists who are seeking political influence - not helping their religion - he warned.
"I think the most likely victim of actual religious discrimination in British society is a Muslim but the person who is most likely to feel slighted because of their religion is an evangelical Christian," he said.
"There are a lot of Christian activist voices who appear bent on stressing the kind of persecution that I don't think really exists in this country. There are some Christian organisations who basically want to have a fight and therefore they're constantly defining the ground in such a way that anyone who doesn't agree wholly agree with them about everything is essentially a messenger from Satan. "I think for a lot of Christian activists, they want to have a fight and they choose sexual orientation as the ground to fight it on. I think that whole argument isn't about the rights of Christians. It's about politics. It's about a group of people who really want to have weight and influence and they've chosen that particular ground.
Personally I don't know why they don't choose ground that really is defending Christian values. I wish they'd choose gambling or human trafficking or something."
"OLD TIME RELIGION" HARMING INTEGRATION
in a highly provocative comment Mr Phillips said he believed Anglican and Catholic churches were seeing growing congregations from African and Carribean backgrounds with "old time" views which put them at odds with mainstream Britain.
"In the Christian and Muslim faiths migration has given some of the great faith institutions a massive shot in the arm," he said.
"I come from that kind of community. We like our faith strong and pretty undiluted. If you come from an Afro-Caribbean Christian background the attitudes to homosexuality are unambiguous, they are undiluted, they are nasty and in some cases homicidal.
"I think there's an awful lot of noise about the Church being persecuted but there is a more real issue that the conventional churches face that the people who are really driving their revival and success believe in an old time religion which in my view is incompatible with a modern, multi-ethnic, multicultural society.
"Muslim communities in this country are doing their damnedest to try to come to terms with their neighbours to try to integrate and they're doing their best to try to develop an idea of Islam that is compatible with living in a modern liberal democracy.
"One of the aspects of that is essentially saying 'whatever we feel about matter of sexuality we're going to have to deal with the fact that most of our neighbours, most of our children's friends, most of our work mates have a broader, more liberal view and we just have to live with that'.
"Integration is also about compromise and I think the reason you don't hear a lot about that from Muslims is that they're trying to find ways of being good Muslims in a way that is consistent with the society they're living in."
