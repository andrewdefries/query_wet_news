Celtic's deal with Magners and Champions League run proves we don't need Rangers, says Peter Lawwell
Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell believes that Wednesday’s announcement of his club’s new sponsorship agreement with Magners proves that his side do not need Rangers as a commercial partner and, with their city rivals currently making a new beginning in the Third Division, he claims that he does not miss the world-renowned Glasgow derbies either.

There were calls from shareholders at Celtic’s annual general meeting to negotiate a separate shirt deal from Rangers for the first time since 1999, with many supporters of the champions believing that the Old Firm brand had become toxic. Lawwell revealed that the Magners contract had been agreed before the AGM but, for reasons of client confidentiality, could not be revealed at that time. However, he was keen to emphasise his conviction that Celtic did not need Rangers to thrive. “I don’t want to talk about other clubs,” he said. “We are not defined by any other club. We have our own brand, our own values and our own traditions.”
In 2011 there were, due to cup ties and replays, a record eight Old Firm meetings during the calendar year and, barring the pair being thrown together in the later stages of the William Hill Scottish Cup, the current season is the first since 1890/91 not to feature a meeting of the great rivals. Lawwell, though, does not pine for the fixture. “Not really: there are pluses and there are minuses, clearly,” he said. “You miss the pluses and you don’t miss the minuses. Related Articles

“You miss the pros and not the cons, so it balances itself out but you definitely wouldn’t swap it for the Champions League.”
It was revealed that Celtic have yet to receive a formal offer for any of their players since the transfer window reopened and Lawwell would prefer the status quo to remain in that regard. He confirmed the arrival, on loan from Standard Liege, of defender Rami Gershon and revealed that he hoped to extend top scorer Gary Hooper’s contract – due to expire at the end of next season – this month. “Neil [Lennon] wants him to stay and we want him to stay,” he said. “He has been a revelation. Gary has the last 16 to keep him here. He has Celtic. He has everything that goes around Celtic. We would hope to hold on to him in January.”
