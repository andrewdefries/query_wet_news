The Apprentice: 12 most idiotic candidates
12. Susan Ma (series 7) Susan was only 21 when she took part in The Apprentice in 2011. She's also of Chinese origin, so not expected to have been au fait with all the details of European culture. Nevertheless, her naivity and ignorance of general knowledge were staggering - even if she did display a sure business sense in many of the tasks. She qualified for idiot status for observations such as "What’s at the British museum? Just, like, dinosaurs and stuff”, as well as her ongoing struggle to grasp French culture (“I don’t even know any French people. I know nothing” and “Do the French go camping? Are the French very fond of their children? Do a lot of people drive in France?”) - even if we do still remain rather fond of her. Picture: BBC

OECD education report: subject results in full The OECD league tables, charting educational standards across the developed world, were published today, with the UK ranking in 23rd for reading and 26th for maths
10:00AM GMT 03 Dec 2013
Comments
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) school league tables, published today, compare 15-year-olds’ abilities in core academic subjects across 65 countries. >> OECD: UK 'treading water' as Far East surges ahead The tables show the scores for the 65 countries and regions in the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) rankings for maths, reading and science. The figures show that the United Kingdom has risen two places, from 28th for maths in 2010 to 26th in these results. The results for reading placed the UK in 23rd, up from 25th in 2010. However, in relation to other countries, the UK has actually slipped across all three disciplines since 2006, when it was ranked 24th for maths, 17th for reading and 14th for science.

'Tory MPs secretly want Scotland independence for Westminster majority' claims Lord Forsyth
The former Scottish Conservative Secretary claims some Tories believe Scotland could make all the difference in the next election
By Simon Johnson, Scottish Political Editor
11:21AM GMT 04 Nov 2013
Comments
Conservative MPs from the south of England secretly want Scotland to vote for independence to give their party a permanent majority at Westminster, a former Tory Scottish secretary has warned. But Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, said they were “foolish” and expressed frustration at colleagues who want to break up the Union for electoral gain. Sir John Major has also said that the Conservatives would be better off without Scotland, but the UK would suffer. He said: “From a purely political point of view we would be better off without Scotland but the UK would not – the UK needs Scotland it ought to have Scotland.”
With Labour holding 41 seats north of the Border compared to the Tories’ one, Lord Forsyth said some Conservatives believe that Scotland could prove the difference at the next general election. Related Articles

However, he said it was wrong to assume it would mean their party would have a permanent majority at Westminster. Lord Forsyth, who was Scottish Secretary in Sir John Major’s Government, said: “There are number of foolish people in the Conservative Party in the south who are keen on independence or ‘Devo max’ (devolution of all tax powers). “Labour thought by creating devolution they would have permanent power in Scotland. I don’t think political parties can establish support by trying to gerrymander the constitution – the voters are smarter than that.”
He also attacked those, including David Cameron, who are promising voters to devolve extra powers to Scotland if voters reject separation next year, arguing this would also harm the Union. Do you think Scotland should vote for independence if it gives the Tories a majority in Westminster?
Henry McLeish, a former Labour Scottish First Minister, said independence would be a “sizeable hit” on the electoral ambitions of Ed Miliband and his sucdessors. “It’s obvious when you consider that the Scottish MPs for a very large part of the Labour group at Westminster,” the former Central Fife MP said. “In the short term independence would have a huge impact, a massive impact on the political dynamic.”
Labour strategists and election experts argued that a general election victory would still possible after independence, pointing out that Tony Blair won three contests with a majority of seats in England and Wales. They said the Tories are failing to make much headway in the North of England and predicted this would become the “new Scotland” if the latter decided to leave the Union. John McTernan, who was political secretary to Tony Blair at Number 10, was optimist about Labour’s chances even if Scots do vote to separate. “Since 1987 the Tories have been losing votes in the cities and the North. They are becoming confined to the South and the country,” he said. “If Scotland left, the North would become the new Scotland.”
He said a vote for independence would also be a “massive psychological blow” to the authority Mr Cameron and George Osborne as they would have overseen the break-up of the UK. This may lead to the British Nationalist elements of the Conservative Party defecting to Ukip, he claimed. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, cited the trio of Blair victories as evidence Scottish independence would “make it difficult but not impossible” for Labour to win future general elections. However, he said the party’s hopes would be harmed by a future boundary review as the electoral system in England is biased towards Labour. The debate over Labour’s prospects came after Sir John Major said during a recent press gallery lunch that the Conservatives “would be better off without Scotland” but the UK would not. Scotland

Under-21 failure in Israel prompts a review over availability of senior England players
England are to review their policy of starlets not playing in Under-21 tournaments if they have been used by the senior team in the same summer.
Under pressure: England's failure at the Under-21 Championship could cost head coach Stuart Pearce his job and prompt a rethink on policy Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Henry Winter, Football Correspondent, in Netanya
11:00PM BST 09 Jun 2013
Follow Comments
Stuart Pearce, the Under-21s coach, was frustrated that the talented likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were not available to him. The Ox Factor has become a matter of intense debate after Pearce’s side tumbled out of the European Under-21 Championship here without their best players like the Arsenal winger and Phil Jones, who were involved in the senior friendly in Rio last week. Their failure looks certain to cost Pearce his job.
“We made one policy decision: if we asked senior players to play against Republic of Ireland and Brazil they would not play in one of the development tournaments,” said David Bernstein, the Football Association chairman. “It’s a policy that needs to be addressed. We need to re-look at the strategic approach to all these tournaments. Whether that would lead to a different view on the sort of specific issues you are talking about remains to be seen. "After all, Oxlade-Chamberlain played half an hour of one match, he got the flavour of Brazil, which was important, and did remarkably well in that half an hour. He possibly saved a match that we might have lost.”

Pearce demands composure

Oxlade-Chamberlain played 87 minutes against the Republic at Wembley, acquiring useful game-time working with Wayne Rooney. He then flew overnight to Rio, starting on the bench, coming on for Glen Johnson after 61 minutes and scoring a fine goal.
“I’m sure Roy was extremely happy to have him there,” Bernstein said. “You have always got to support the England senior manager in the pressure that he is under of wanting his strongest squad. "A lot of people would say it was a very important game, a dry run for the World Cup. Nobody can argue that the World Cup shouldn’t take priority.”
From Oxlade-Chamberlain’s perspective, he is now closer to reboarding the flight to Rio next summer – if England manage to qualify. An intelligent individual who thinks about his career development, he could have become an even more tournament-tuned player had he gone to the Under-21s as well. He cannot be exhausted, having made only 17 starts and 16 substitute appearances for Arsenal last season.
It can be done. Admittedly over far fewer miles. Blackburn’s Josh King journeyed from Tirana where he had been with Norway’s seniors to Tel Aviv. “I flew down, had six hours sleep and got back with the Under-21s team,” King said. As Phil Neville says, it is down to the individual player. It is his career.
“We wouldn’t have asked those players to travel across the Atlantic, play in a hot climate and then play here,’’ Bernstein argued. “As far as I know, there was no pressure from the clubs. "It was a policy of our own. I also absolutely support these tournaments, they’re fantastic, the players benefit from being here, so I can understand Stuart’s frustration. But I still support both. If the two clash, the England senior team simply has to have priority.”
Bernstein was talking at a joint-initiative in Netanya between the FA, the Israel FA and New Israel Fund’s Kick It Out – Football for All project.
England players Marvin Sordell, Jason Steele, Declan Rudd and Nathan Delfouneso joined in training with local children who play in mixed Arab-Israeli leagues.
Pearce was not present at the event and is not expected to earn a new contract after England’s hapless on-field performance in Israel.
“There will be a meeting in the next fortnight, definitely,’’ Bernstein confirmed.
His successor, Greg Dyke, will be involved. “The new chairman should definitely have a say,” Bernstein said. “I don’t want to tie the hands of my successor.”
Dyke is friends with Glenn Hoddle, the former senior-team coach being linked with the Under-21s job. Gareth Southgate, Phil Neville and Peter Taylor are also names in the frame.
Pearce has arguably stayed so long in the role – six years – because of the lack of alternatives. The level of high-class home-grown coaching options mirrors the dearth of players.
“One of the prime reasons for St George’s Park was to get more qualified coaches,” Bernstein said. “We have a fair number.
“Stuart’s record has been good, which is why this is particularly disappointing. His record in qualifying has been very good. He’s been pretty successful for us but this tournament hasn’t been a success. He’s done well over a long period, particularly with all the factors. He’s operated with quite a difficult hand.”
There is plenty for Dyke to tackle on the road to rescuing England, from the need for a winter break between the third and fourth rounds of the FA Cup, to nurturing mentally tougher players at academies, to finding a way to give the 18-21 generation more match-time to making the clubs more sympathetic to England needs.
“We need more quality players and we are aiming to change it over the coming years,” Bernstein said. “Club England and the FA generally need to look at how we prioritise these tournaments. There will be some things to learn from this.”
The lessons of another failed tournament are wearisomely familiar. The FA does not have a great track record of heeding those lessons.
