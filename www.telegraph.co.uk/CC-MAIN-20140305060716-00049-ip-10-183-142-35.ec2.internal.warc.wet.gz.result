A red tape nightmare has hit our village cricket club for six
The demands made on our little village cricket club in Litton, Somerset, reflect wider problems with the way Britain is run.

Comments
Compared with some of the weightier matters addressed in this column, the threatened closure of a tiny Somerset cricket club might seem trivial. But the team for which I play on Sundays is battling for survival because it has been caught by a bizarre bureaucratic doube-whammy which reflects much of what is going askew with the way our country is run – not least the extent to which our mighty government machine has lost contact with the everyday lives of those it is meant to serve.
On the one hand, our club has been told that, for the field and two semi-derelict sheds where we change and keep our mowers, we must pay “non-domestic rates” equivalent to more than £100 for every home game we play. On the other, we are told by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs that we cannot get any relief on this exorbitant demand because our constitution does not state explicitly that membership is open to anyone regardless of “sex, age, disability, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, religion or other beliefs”.
Litton Cricket Club’s constitution has always stated that we are open to anyone who wants to join. Our players range in age from 11 to 73 and have included a Nigerian and my son’s 12-year-old Indian nephew. Wives help with teas, children play on the boundary; the club is warmly supported by many villagers, not least at our fund-raising annual dinners and quiz nights. But because our constitution does not include a “non-discrimination” clause worded in exactly the way laid down, we must pay rates 10 times larger than any other village club in our area, and more than our members could be expected to pay.
Our battle to win rate relief began 10 years ago, when we were first faced with a demand for over £700. We discovered that this was only £400 less than a demand that was being objected to by one of the top city clubs in southern England, with 150 playing members and a large, fully-equipped clubhouse. Eventually we won relief, thanks to the intervention of local councillors.

Some years back, however, our council outsourced responsibility for its business rates to Capita, a private firm based in Bromley, Kent, which last year told us the policy had changed. In March we were told we would now have to pay the full tax unless HMRC classified us as a CASC, a Community Amateur Sports Club. We filed an application to HMRC and paid £70 as a first instalment, but were then threatened with court action unless we paid the full sum. Thanks to the intervention of our local councillor, we were given a stay of execution until our CASC application had been processed. Last month we finally had a letter from Liverpool to say that our application had been refused. This was because our constitution did not in effect make it absolutely explicit that the club would not discriminate against any one-legged Inuit lesbian Druid pensioner who might wish to join, We appealed, explaining that the club’s survival depended on it. Having rewritten our constitution exactly according to the formula suggested on HMRC’s website, we asked whether, if we made a new application, this would now be acceptable. Liverpool’s refusal of our appeal last week explained that it was not HMRC’s concern whether our club closed. It said nothing about our new constitution, but merely repeated its insistence that the old one had not stated. the prescribed wording that our club was open to anyone (it merely said “membership is open to anyone”).
There was a time when matters like this could have been quickly sorted out by a couple of councillors familiar with our village. Instead, this battle, involving enough paperwork to fill an inch-thick file, has taken so many months that, if only I were a lawyer and able to charge £500 an hour, I could retire on the proceeds. We have now made our new CASC application, which we hope will tick every one of the many required boxes. Meanwhile the fate of our club hangs on the ruling of one official in Liverpool and another in Bromley, Kent, each more than 100 miles from the little Someset village where their decisions are awaited with considerable interest.

Madame de Sade: Hara-kiri, sex and six women
What drove the writer of a play about the libidinous Frenchman to disembowel himself?
Link to this video
By Frances Wilson
3:21PM GMT 09 Mar 2009
Comments
Next Friday, a little-known Japanese play, Madame de Sade, will have its West End debut at the Donmar Warehouse, this year in residency at Wyndham's Theatre. It should be a night to remember. The play's subject is the infamous Marquis de Sade; the play's author, Yukio Mishima, was a celebrated Japanese writer and masochist who committed hara-kiri in 1970, five years after Madame de Sade was first performed. Mishima's death was as plotted as anything he achieved in his brief and busy lifetime: self disembowelment with an ancient samurai dagger followed by decapitation by a friend. As it happened, his suicide was so botched (his head, rather than being removed in one clean sweep, was slowly hacked from his neck) that instead of symbolising the warrior spirit of ancient Japanese culture, it became the object of tabloid mockery. With their shared interests in sex, pain, and the beauty of death, the post-war Japanese imperialist and the so-called "father" of the French Revolution make ideal bedfellows. De Sade does not, however, appear in Mishima's play, which spans a period of 18 years over three acts. Instead his character is explored through the drawing-room conversation, or rather what Mishima called the ''collisions of ideas'', between six cultivated women in the marquis's inner circle. They include his loyal wife, Renee, Madame de Sade (played by Rosamund Pike); her deceitful sister, Anne (Fiona Button), who has also been de Sade's lover; and her disapproving mother, Madame de Montreuil (Judi Dench). Three further figures, played by Frances Barber, Deborah Findlay, and Jenny Galloway, add their own opinions to the play's polite conversation about perversity.
Unless you caught Ingmar Bergman's production in 1995, described by one reviewer on The New York Times as displaying ''such spellbinding, gimcrack-free order that it serves to refresh the senses'', it is unlikely that you will have seen Madame de Sade before. Bergman's achievement was to turn a Japanese drama of ideas about an 18th-century Frenchman, acted in Swedish and presented in New York with the English translation (by Donald Keene) heard via earphones, into an elegant and clearly defined performance. It sounds as if Michael Grandage, the director of the Donmar production, will be producing something equally striking, if less complicated. "What could be more theatrically exciting," Grandage says, "than staging a huge debate about good and evil? Madame de Sade is the perfect centrepiece to everything we are trying to do at the Donmar." Grandage is referring to the Donmar's policy of encouraging a new theatre-going audience by putting on rarely performed plays at affordable prices (seats begin at £10 and peak at £32.50). "On some levels Madame de Sade is high 18th-century porn," Grandage continues, "contained in a genuinely thrilling narrative. The audience will not have seen anything like this before: it will be like going to a new play. No one knows what to expect or what comes next, or how they will actually respond to a figure like the Marquis de Sade." Mishima's inspiration for Madame de Sade was less the charismatic character of the marquis himself than the masochism of his wife, Renee. If de Sade is a "monster of immorality", Renee reasons, then "I must be a monster of devotion". Her devotion took on a curious twist in 1790, when, having remained loyal to her husband for 18 years of his imprisonment, she promptly left him as soon as he was released. In the play's electrifying final scene, Renee praises her husband's creation of ''an impenetrable cathedral of vice'' and claims that with his steadfast devotion to the cause of Eros he has built himself ''a back staircase to Heaven''. But while she applauds his ideals, she is appalled by the man. The devoted wife is one of the many parallels Madame de Sade draws between modern Japanese society and pre-Revolutionary France (Mishima's spouse, Yoko Sugiyama, whom he married to please his mother, was also a monster of devotion). Another striking parallel between the two cultures is the relationship between the formality and reticence of Japanese manners and the dainty exchanges of the European Enlightenment salon. ''What we are dealing with here is very exciting,'' Grandage explains. ''A Japanese writer uses another time, another completely different culture, to explore his experiences from his own time and culture. And to have this drama staged in a West End theatre rather than in an art-house is unique.''
The drama of Madame de Sade is shaped not through action but through what Mishima called the ''confrontation between two contradictory ideas''. Offstage his life was equally full of contradictory ideas, although his biographers suggest ''offstage'' was perhaps not a concept known to a showman such as Mishima, who starred in gangster films, collected homoerotic photographs of himself and formed his own private army. At the same time as fanatically wanting to preserve Japan from Western influence, he lived in a Victorian-style house, wore Levi's, fetishised Baroque European art and drew inspiration from André Gide and Racine. Like Byron (also sexually transgressive and at odds with his society), Mishima was a prolific and internationally known writer who saw himself also as a politician, a soldier, and a man of the people, but if he is remembered now it is for the manner of his end. He hoped to be immortalised as an artist, fusing art and death on his final day by killing himself after handing in his novel to his publisher. Had he won the Nobel Prize as he was tipped to do, would Mishima have committed hara-kiri on the podium in Oslo? It sounds as if the Donmar's Madame de Sade will at last upstage Mishima's final performance: if the production is as stimulating as it promises, masochists need not attend. 'Madame de Sade' is at Wyndham's Theatre, London WC2 (0844 482 5120) from Friday Theatre

HMS Victory rotting and being pulled apart under its own weight HMS Victory is riddled with rot and being pulled apart by its own weight, maintenance reports of the historic ship have found. According to maintenance documents HMS Victory is leaking, is riddled with rot and is gradually being pulled apart by its own weight Photo: PA	By Jasper Copping

As Britain's most celebrated warship, she withstood the onslaught of the combined French and Spanish navies at the Battle of Trafalgar. But HMS Victory, the flagship of Lord Nelson, now faces its ultimate battle.
The 245-year-old ship is leaking, is riddled with rot and is gradually being pulled apart by its own weight, according to maintenance documents and a structural survey obtained by The Sunday Telegraph.
Much-needed repairs have not been carried out and previous renovation work may have even damaged the HMS Victory's structural integrity.
The ship faces an uncertain fate, with the government looking to cut funding for her and considering handing over the running of her.
Campaigners fear it could be "offloaded" to the local council, a private company or to a charity, who would not have the funds to preserve the warship.

The reports have been compiled in recent months following surveys of the vessel.
One details how the vessel is being gradually pulled apart by its own weight, because it is not adequately supported by the cradle built for it in Portsmouth's naval dockyard.
It is sitting in a dry dock meaning that there is no water around the vessel to support its bottom and sides. Instead, the weight of the vessel is pushing the sides out.
As a result, so-called "knee joints" – vast brackets which hold the sides of the ship to beams which give the vessel its internal framework – are working loose. Gradual movement of the timbers has been observed by the researchers. Gaps as large as 3cm are now visible between the joints and the sides or the beams. In some places, the ends of the beams are now as much as 10cm from the sides of the ship. Some joints are no longer attached to the hull at all.
Researchers carried out investigations on nine knee joints with no obvious structural problems, but found that a third of them are not connected to the hull at all.
As well as studying the ship itself, the report's authors looked at historical shipbuilding documents to fully understand the purpose of the knees and found that some bolts used to hold them in place were removed during previous restoration work.
In some cases where they have been replaced, the new bolts only fix the knees to planking that gives the ship an "inner skin", and do not penetrate the planks which hold the sides in place.
A second report reveals widespread problems with rain water entering the vessel, leading to extensive wood rot. The water is also thought to have worsened the structural problems.
The document states that there were even reports of water leaking into the cabin used by Thomas Hardy, who captained the ship at the Battle of Trafalgar and was with Lord Nelson as he died on board from wounds inflicted in the fighting by a French sharpshooter.
Despite several reports of leaks and the damage caused by the water, the report states: "very little work has been requested and approved to alleviate this problem".
In the report, officials admit that they do not even know the sources of some of the major leaks.
Another area of concern relates to the rigging. The report found that remedial work needed had not been carried out and could even lead to the closure of parts of the Upper Deck to the public, because of the risk of parts of the rigging falling.
The maintenance problems facing the ship have emerged as the government is looking to cut the costs of running the ship.
Later this year, ministers are expected to announce changes to the way it is run.
Although more than 350,000 people visit the ship every year, HMS Victory remains a serving, commissioned warship and its basic £1.5 million a year maintenance costs are paid for out of the defence budget.
A spokesman for the MoD insisted that it will not sell off the Victory, but campaigners fear the running of it will be taken over by a charity – such as the Mary Rose Trust – the local council, or a private company.
Alistair Thompson, deputy leader of the opposition Conservative group on Portsmouth council and leader of a local campaign in support of the warship, warned: "We will lose part of the tradition and that the ship will no longer be maintained to the standard it should be. "These problems sound incredibly expensive. Would any third party possibly be able to foot the bill?
"In terms of British history, HMS Victory is probably the most important artefact we have. It defines a whole period of British history.
"It must be protected. I would be deeply concerned that, at the time that the navy knows about these significant problems, that it is trying to offload them onto someone else."
"The navy generates an income from this and gets PR from it. It has many traditions it is extremely proud of and has an unparalleled history which should be embraced."
Admiral the Lord Boyce, a former First Sea Lord and chief of the defence staff, said: "The important thing is that HMS Victory remains. "She is absolutely iconic, a living, visible memory of Pax Britannica and how this country gained its great wealth through its maritime trade, as a result of the ruling of the waves by the Royal Navy. It absolutely captures that place in our history."
The vessel was launched in 1765 and enjoyed its finest hour in 1805, at the Battle of Trafalgar, which ushered in more than a century of British supremacy at sea.
She was later used as a depot and a training vessel before being placed in a dry dock for her preservation following a campaign in the 1920s.
However, she continued to face enemy action – receiving bomb damage during a Luftwaffe raid in 1941.
An MoD spokesman said: "There is an ongoing programme of repair and investment to ensure that this iconic vessel is preserved for future generations. "We are currently considering a number of options for how she will be funded in the future, but there are no plans for her to be sold and she will remain a commissioned warship."

Cameron to push G8 on finance bonds for new 'social investment’ David Cameron is to throw his weight behind radical plans to bring private investors into public services through rapidly growing new financial products called social impact bonds.

The Prime Minister will use the UK’s presidency of the G8 this year to develop new agreements on “impact investing” where funds buy bonds with a guaranteed return if certain public policies are delivered.
One of the first social impact bonds in the UK was launched three years ago to support a project to reduce re-offending by inmates at Peterborough Prison. The projects are delivered by social enterprises, not-for-profit organisations, foundations and charities.
“Britain and other developed nations face a shared challenge – sorting out our debt problems and achieving economic growth. We need to do this at the same time as improving public services and tackling our deepest social problems,” the Prime Minister told The Sunday Telegraph. “That’s why this Government has placed such an emphasis on social innovation from charities, social enterprises and other businesses.
“Making this work requires a new kind of financial investment to help grow a bigger, stronger society. Britain is a global leader in this field.

“We launched the world’s first social investment bank Big Society Capital and we invented the world’s first social impact bond to help fund payments by results in public services where government only pays for what works.”
Big Society Capital is chaired by Sir Ronald Cohen, the founding partner and former chairman of Apax Partners. It uses funds from dormant bank accounts and the four “Merlin” banks, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays, which each donated £50m.
“There is growing interest in Britain’s social investment model around the world,” Mr Cameron said. “So I want to use our G8 presidency to push this agenda forward. We will work with other G8 nations to grow the social investment market and increase investment, allowing the best social innovations to spread and help tackle our shared social and economic challenges.”
In the Peterborough example, bond holders are only paid if recidivism rates reduce. A social enterprise business, St Giles Trust, works with the prison and offenders to support them when they are freed.
Nick Hurd, the Conservative MP and minister for civil society, is responsible for the project. He said at a time when pub­lic sector budgets were under pressure social impact investing gave organisations access to “long term affordable finance”. Banks and Finance

Angler, London EC2, restaurant review
After landing uninspiring starters at this seafood-in-the-City restaurant, would I be won over by the rest of my lunch?

Comments
Angler South Place Hotel, 3 South Place, London EC2M 2AF Contact: 020 3215 1260 anglerrestaurant.com
Price: Three courses: £43.30
Angler is quite strangely positioned, market-wise – typically for a hotel restaurant, its core customers are the lawyers and other suits of its City of London postcode. At first glance, it is as sleek and sharp as you'd expect (I have a beef with rooms that are largely window on one side – it makes me feel like I'm eating in a lift – but this is a personal prejudice). On closer inspection, it is slightly less luxe; with large, polished aluminium screens, and Ikea-ey shelves festooned with bottles of unremarkable spirits, it all looks a bit middle-brow. I didn't object, but I didn't swoon, either. B, who has lived in Israel and Cornwall, joint fish capitals of the world (apparently), had the tuna tartare (£14). She said with equanimity that it left no trace of being in her mouth, even while she was chewing it. It was curiously bland. I had the mixed grill (£26.50 – it's pricey for a starter, all right, but everyone raves about it) with a sauce vierge and a pool of hollandaise, and both the sauces were lovely. The fish wasn't – the scallops were fine, but neither the shrimps nor the mullet looked all that fresh. The mullet's flesh was tired and solid. B was sniffy about the skin colour, saying it lacked clarity and liveliness. However – and this is a turnaround enough to make you think the first course was an aberration or bad dream – the mains were gorgeous. B's cod (£18.50) came swimming in French indulgence, a creamy sauce the colour of butter, with blobs of basil emulsion like floating lily pads and flat tubes of pearly baby squid that, dancing on a trapeze between raw and cooked, had a beautiful texture and were perfectly fresh. The cod itself had this moreish brown top, while inside it was sleek and white and flawless. There were fat but tasty mussels as well; the whole plate was a picture of old-school, Elizabeth David-style generosity. I had a skate wing with brown shrimp, butter and parsley (£15.50), in which the butter had been browned to that point of incomprehensible deliciousness, and the luscious, slightly sweet flesh of the skate was great with the teeny, punchy shrimp. Creamed spinach (£3.50) wasn't very good, though – it seemed to add up to less than the sum of its parts, with neither the spinach nor the cream having much impact. Mousseline potato, or mash, if you prefer (£3.50), was fine. Related Articles

23 Oct 2012
Chocolate fondant (£7.50) looked attractive enough: a dainty cylinder of the fondant itself, a modest spoon of milk ice cream and some classic fancy touches to remind you you're in a restaurant rather than an ambitious gastropub – sauce scraped artfully across the plate, and biscuity crumbs beneath the ice cream and fondant, to mess around with your mouthfeel. It was perfectly nice. I'm not sure how inventive it was, but this isn't an experimental place. This is fine by me. Originality is like an iPad, or any other hi-tech solution to a problem I didn't have; I'm happy when it works, but don't seek it out. I had the pannacotta (£6.50), which was my dish of the lunch, although it was fractionally stiffer than my ideal. It had a soft, mellow buttermilk flavour, with a trace of rosemary. And it was topped with a mélange of orange jelly and orange 'granite', a sort of crumble made from semi-dried orange – both were zingy, sweet and citric, but in concert they were dazzling, the textures complicating the bite, calling attention to the taste's purity. By City standards the prices are mid-range; it's even good value, if you avoid the mixed grill. But in this spick-and-span atmosphere (they'd call it professional, some might call it a bit characterless) you have to be a perfectionist. Otherwise it comes across that you're concentrating on the wrong things. THE FISH LIST... Crab & Lobster Dishforth Road, Asenby, Thirsk, North Yorkshire (01845 577286) Fishing curios and quirky antiques dangle from every beam of this thatched cottage, where you can expect great seafood in every guise, from mash-topped fish pie (£17) to Goan curry with king prawns and lobster claw (£20) Fishy Fishy 36 East Street, Brighton, East Sussex (01273 723750) With its dusky blue walls and dark wooden furniture, this bistro in a Regency town house is a stylish spot for lunch in the Lanes. Chilli fans should try the spicy crab cooked in ginger and garlic, with skinny chips (£18.50) Fishers 1 Shore, Leith, Edinburgh (0131 554 5666) For 20 years this cosy restaurant, based in a 17th-century watchtower on the waterfront, has kept locals happy with great-value fish dishes. The fishcakes (£9.95) are a menu staple, while specials include hake with butternut squash purée and new potatoes (£15.95) Restaurants

Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade SP review Honda’s track-focused Fireblade SP is fast and refined, but can it match its rivals?

Razor sharp: Honda sticks to tradition with the Fireblade SP Photo: ZEP GORI, FRANCERC MONTERO AND ULA SERRA By Roland Brown

Honda’s Fireblade has often defied convention, never more than with this first ever SP model. In the tradition of Sport Production bikes it’s a higher specification version of the standard Fireblade, created primarily for improved racetrack performance.
An SP model typically features a tuned engine plus uprated suspension, brakes and tyres. The Fireblade SP’s modified four-cylinder powerplant and components from Öhlins, Brembo and Pirelli tick those boxes. Honda’s new super-sports flagship might also be expected to feature an array of electronic rider aids, given that many less exotic class rivals already include such features.
That’s where the SP swims against the flow, because it has just one riding mode, no traction control and no electronic suspension adjustment. In this determination to keep things simple Honda is continuing a tradition of doing things its own way, dating back to 1992 and the revolutionary first Fireblade, whose capacity of 893cc split the established 750cc and litre-plus classes before being increased to 999cc.
This Fireblade’s 16-valve engine retains that capacity. For 2014 it’s mildly tuned, with polished and reshaped intake and exhaust ports, increasing maximum output by 2bhp to 178bhp. For SP use Honda blueprints it by selecting piston and connecting rod sets whose weights vary by less than one gram, rather than the usual three.

The riding position is more aggressive, with handlebars wider spaced and slightly farther forward, and footrests 10mm farther back. Despite this the SP has a familiar Fireblade feel. It seems almost old-fashioned to start such a fancy new superbike simply by turning the ignition key, pressing the starter button, selecting first gear and letting out the clutch, with no thought to settings or modes.
One of the Fireblade’s strengths in recent years has been its flexible, rider-friendly nature – by the standards of 170bhp-plus rocket-ships, that is. Throttle response is flawless. Once into its stride at 6,000rpm the motor builds power in a wonderfully strong, consistent surge to the redline at 13,000rpm.
The Honda lacks the frenzied top-end charge of its most powerful rivals but with a top speed of more than 170mph it’s an incredibly fast motorcycle. On the main straight at the flowing, if featureless, Losail circuit in Qatar it was still accelerating at more than 160mph, despite a strong headwind that was whistling over the subtly reshaped, more aerodynamic screen.
The main benefit of weight-matched pistons is reduced vibration. The SP is certainly smooth, even at high revs, though you’d have to be very familiar with the current model to notice a difference. Its gearchange is good, although the lack of an electronic quick-shifter is disappointing.
Honda’s aluminium twin-spar frame is revised around the swing-arm pivot area, to provide slightly more flex for improved feedback. The firm’s chassis development work with Swedish suspension expert Öhlins, which provides the front forks and rear shock, also resulted in new triple clamps for extra rigidity at the steering head.
The handling is predictably excellent, the suspension giving a subtly more taut, racer-like feel, with minimal pitching under acceleration and braking. High-speed stability is impeccable, the steering very neutral and precise.
Braking is outstandingly powerful and controllable, boosted by the adoption of Brembo’s Monobloc calipers. The combined ABS system is revised based on feedback from the Honda Legends endurance racing team, with the front and rear systems being linked to a slightly reduced degree.
This bike is not built for comfort, let alone pillions. Its single seat is firmer, for more precise feedback. A cut-down rear subframe saves some weight. The SP is unashamedly the most purposeful, least practical Fireblade yet, and the best suited to hard riding.
What makes the SP stand out even more is the way this most exotic of Fireblades eschews the modern trend towards electronic rider aids. Would it be more versatile and safer if it featured multiple riding modes, traction control and electronically adjustable or semiactive suspension? Probably, although inevitably it would also cost more than the already steep price of £14,999.
There’s no doubt that a sizeable band of hardcore super-sports riders, including many existing Fireblade owners, will be delighted with it just the way it is. Honda’s traditional approach has retained the model’s trademark poise, while creating what, for track use at least, is undoubtedly the sharpest and best ’Blade yet. THE FACTS
Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade SP Tested: 999cc four-stroke four, six-speed transmission Price/on sale: £14,999 (£15,599 with ABS)/February Power/torque: 178bhp @ 12,250rpm/84lb ft @ 10,500rpm Top speed: 180mph (estimated) Range: 120 miles @ 38mpg (estimated) Verdict: Exotic, track-focused version of Honda's super-sports four. Fast, refined, sweet-handling and well equipped, but expensive and lacking some of its rivals' high-tech features Telegraph rating: Four out of five stars RIVALS
BMW HP4, £16,700 This even more advanced version of the awesome S1000RR holds its 190bhp four-cylinder engine in a high-tech chassis incorporating semi-active suspension. Ducati 1199 Panigale, £15,995 Even the "basic" version of Ducati's 1198cc V-twin combines 195bhp performance with multiple riding modes, ABS, quick-shifter and drop-dead gorgeous looks. MV Agusta F4R, £14,499 This mid-ranking model of the Italian marque's 998cc fours produces 192bhp and has an Öhlins shock. Stylish, fast and raw but lacks the Honda's refinement. Honda

A diver is circled by a shark feeding frenzy off the coast of Port Elizabeth, South Africa. This is the breathtaking moment a daredevil diver is swept up in a whirlwind feeding frenzy of sharks. A school of 16ft, 900kg tiger sharks and oceanic black tips swarm the vulnerable swimmer who appears to remain surprisingly calm. The unnamed diver fearlessly lowered a bucket packed with sardines - a favorite of the sharks - into the water, all while still clinging to the line. He was quickly surrounded by dozens of the creatures.Picture: Rainer Schimpf/Barcroft Media

British missionaries charged with sedition in Gambia A British couple who moved to Gambia to work as Christian missionaries have been arrested and charged with sedition. Dave Fulton and his wife Fiona (holding their adopted daughter Elizabeth), daughter Iona and son Luke Photo: PA	By Matthew Moore 11:19PM GMT 04 Dec 2008
David and Fiona Fulton, aged 60, and 46, were last night in police custody at separate cells in the West African state, which has a 90 per cent Muslim population.
The couple, originally from Troon, Scotland were detained on Saturday but have been unable to raise raise enough local people to vouch for them to secure their release on bail.
Mr Fulton, who is being held at Mile Two prison, a high security jail outside the capital Banjul, is said to be in poor health, and is refusing food. Mrs Fulton is at a police station with their adopted two-year-old daughter Elizabeth.
The pair appeared in court in Banjul yesterday accused of sedition, a serious charge brought against people suspected of undermining the government.
A friend of the couple said they feared the missionaries, who moved to Gambia 12 years ago, had fallen victim to power games in the tiny African state.
"As a chaplain part of David's job is to provide comfort to all sorts of people, people high up and people low down – and people who have perhaps fallen out of favour," said the friend, who did not wish to be named.
"I don't know of anything they have done that could be called sedition. Their whole focus has been teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.
"Sedition is a serious crime anywhere. The penalty would not be light.
"Obviously we are concerned. A lot of Christian people all over Britain and all over Europe are praying for them. We are just trusting the outcome will be good."
Mrs Fulton, originally from Torquay, is being treated well, but there are fears for the health of her husband, a former British Army Major. "We are not sure about David. We don't think he's fared quite as well. He's not eating," the friend said.
The Fultons have two other children, Iona, 20, and Luke, 17, who live near Exeter with another family.
Mr Fulton works as a chaplain in the Gambian Army and his wife looks after terminally ill people and spends time visiting women in their homes and in hospital.
They were first arrested on Saturday after police arrived at their house in Kerr Sering, an hour's drive out in the African bush from the capital.
Pastor Martin Speed, of Westhoughton Pentecostal Church in Bolton, Greater Manchester, said the couple had visited Christians at his church to talk about their work.
"The work he is doing is not political," Pastor Speed said. "He's sharing his Christian faith with people.
"There does seem to be a growing difficulty of Christians in the country of Gambia. We are really concerned about the situation."
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "Two British nationals have been arrested in Gambia and Foreign Office consular staff have been in touch with the couple and are providing consular assistance."
Gambia, a country of 1.7 million, is ruled by President Yahya Jammeh, an army officer who seized power in 1994.
His record on human rights and civil freedoms has been questioned after a crackdown on anyone who has criticised the government.

BBC's Diamond Jubilee coverage 'cringingly inept', says Michael Buerk
Michael Buerk has attacked the BBC’s coverage of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations as “cringingly inept”, singling out Strictly Come Dancing's Tess Daly for being a "bird-brain” presenter.

11:43AM GMT 30 Dec 2012
In a sweeping broadside against coverage of the Thames Pageant in particular, the veteran BBC journalist said he was “so ashamed” that he almost wept. In an article reviewing the year for The Mail on Sunday, he accused the presenters of being ignorant of the monarchy and British history, and instead focusing on speaking to “even more vacuous D-list celebrities”. He reserved special loathing for Daly's contribution, describing her as “a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly Come Dancing”. Referring to the way June's Thames river pageant was covered by the BBC, Buerk said: "The one enduring British institution was mocked by another that had shamefully lost its way."
"Out on the water, a tribute to the Monarch that resonated back to the Middle Ages, rich in historical continuities, a floating salute to past glory and present fortitude. On the screen, a succession of Daytime airheads preened themselves, or gossiped with even more vacuous D-list 'celebrities'. With barely an exception, they were cringingly inept. Related Articles

"Nobody knew anything and nobody cared. The main presenter couldn't even work out what to call the Queen,” he noted, referring to the fact that she was mistakenly referred to as Her Royal Highness, rather than Her Majesty. He continued: "The Dunkirk Little Ships, the most evocative reminders of this country's bravest hour, were ignored so that a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly Come Dancing could talk to transvestites in Battersea Park. "I was so ashamed of the BBC I would have wept if I hadn't been so angry. The worst thing was that it was deliberate - planned than way to be ‘light’ and ‘inclusive’.”
The corporation received more than 2,400 complaints from the public about some of its live broadcasts over the weekend, with much of the blame being directed at George Entwistle, the then head of BBC Vision who went on to become director-general. The BBC was so out of touch that he said it "actually congratulated itself" for the Jubilee coverage "and the executive ultimately responsible [Entwistle] was promptly promoted to become the most disastrous director-general in the corporation's history".

Wife of British hostage appeals for his return
The wife of Alan McMenemy, a British hostage still missing in Iraq, has made an emotional plea for his kidnappers to end his family's ordeal. Alan McMenemy (right) was protecting Peter Moore (left) when he was abducted in Iraq by gunmen 7:45AM BST 29 May 2010
Mr McMenemy, a security guard, was abducted three years ago by gunmen in Iraq along with three other guards and the IT expert they were protecting. His wife Rosaleen McMenemy urged those holding him to show "mercy and compassion" on Saturday, the anniversary of his abduction. Mr McMenemy is feared dead, but the kidnappers, an Iraqi Shia militia group, have yet to provide any proof. The bodies of the three other guards kidnapped at the same time have been returned to Britain while Peter Moore, the man they were protecting, was released alive in December last year. Mrs McMenemy said: "It's now been three years since he's been held captive, which is 1,096 days. Related Articles

"This is far too long for myself and our two children and I would ask those holding him to please show mercy and compassion and return him to us immediately and unconditionally. "You've showed compassion by releasing his four colleagues and I would ask you to do the same for my family to bring closure to this."
Mr McMenemy was taken from a finance ministry building in Baghdad three years ago. The militants were posing as police. His wife spoke of their last time together before Mr McMenemy went off to work in Baghdad. "We'd spent the weekend with the children in Edinburgh," she said. "It was our wedding anniversary, we spent a couple of days there, it was a lovely couple of days, it was very nice."
"Alan was just looking forward to coming back from work and maybe having a family holiday. It would have been lovely."
After arriving back home, Mr Moore described being beaten, shackled and subjected to mock executions. He paid tribute to his security guards, saying: "Certainly without that help and advice I definitely wouldn't be stood here today."

Gareth Bale refuses to comment on potential move from Tottenham Hotspur to Real Madrid this summer
Gareth Bale has refused to comment on speculation linking him with a world-record move to Real Madrid this summer. All by myself: Gareth Bale has been training on his on while on international duty with Wales Photo: PA	By Telegraph Sport, and agencies

Spurs and Real have yet to come to an agreement over the transfer of Bale despite weeks of speculation that the 24-year-old is set to move to the nine-time European champions. Bale has made it clear he wants to leave Spurs for the Spanish capital, but chairman Daniel Levy is said to be demanding a fee in excess of the £80million that Real paid Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo four years ago. Several Spanish camera crews and photographers turned up to watch Bale train with Wales in Newport yesterday and they later accosted the forward in the car park of the team hotel. Disappointingly, for all those interested in the transfer saga, Bale refused to divulge his feelings about Madrid's interest. "I'm really sorry, now's not the time to talk," he said. Bale has not played for Tottenham for almost a month because of injuries to a gluteal muscle and now his foot. Related Articles

The former Southampton winger undertook a short training session away from the rest of the Wales squad yesterday. He will not take part in Wales' game against Republic of Ireland tomorrow, but will remain with the squad to continue his rehabilitation and he is expected to be a spectator at the game in Cardiff. During Bale's absence, Tottenham have been active in the transfer market, spending £50million on Roberto Soldado, Nacer Chadli and Paulinho. The London club hope to announce the signing of versatile Toulouse midfielder Etienne Capoue once he returns from international duty with France. Meanwhile, Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen admits he would be interested in a move to White Hart Lane. The 21-year-old has rejected interest from Russia and could now be reunited with his former Ajax team-mate Jan Vertonghen at Spurs. "Tottenham are a great club," he said. "I know from Vertonghen that it is a good club which is interesting. but there has not been any contact. "I do not know if I am going to leave Ajax. We'll find out in two weeks. "There are to my knowledge no negotiations right now either with a new club or Ajax. "If there is a good approach (from another club), I see as an opportunity to try something new, but if nothing comes, I do not mind staying."

Dane Kenneth Jonassen ready to take English badminton a step further
New Great Britain singles coach Kenneth Jonassen has warned players not to expect an easy ride when he takes charge this summer.

Comments
The former world No 2 was last month named by Badminton England as the man to drive the nation's singles players towards the London 2012 Olympics. The 35-year-old will primarily oversee the development of England's players at their Milton Keynes base but will take charge of all the British elite as the build-up to the Games intensifies. He will be present at the European Championships this week where England and Denmark will look to take a stanglehold of the medals in Manchester. England's top men's singles players Rajiv Ouseph, Andrew Smith and Carl Baxter are ranked 23, 26 and 35 in the world respectively and Jonassen wants immediate improvement. The 35-year-old said: "When they think they have reached their limit, I want to push them more. "I will show them we need to examine every part of their game to see if we can improve that.

"We need to bring intensity to practice. We want a group of three or four players wanting this more than anything. "Our goal always has to be to push the limits and never be satisfied with the current level, always wanting more."
Jonassen is the reigning European singles champion but is now winding down his playing career in club badminton. He has also been coaching the elite Danish players but will step down this summer to take up his new Badminton England role in July. Throughout his own days on the circuit, Jonassen was spurred on to greater things by legendary compatriot Peter Gade and he hopes to foster similar domestic rivalries in England. He said: "I think the Danish singles players want more than just being number one in Denmark. They want to be No 1 in the world. "That is totally an attitude towards practice. I had all my close training sessions with Peter and I was reaching a high level in practice every day because he was and he said exactly the same. "We understood we had to give our best every day against each other. Now, since I have stopped, Jan Jorgensen is pushing Peter, so they have another one. "That is something I want to bring in to everyday practice and competition."

Wasps see off Gloucester and set their sights on a top-four finish in the Premiership
Wasps’ bid to return to Europe’s elite continues to gather momentum. Fuelled by another storming performance from Billy Vunipola, Gloucester became their latest victims as the London club won 33-29 and kept their sights fixed on a top-four finish.

Comments
Vunipola, the England No 8 prospect, charged over for a second-half try while another Saxons starlet, wing Christian Wade, made it 12 tries for the season. Gloucester caused a few flutters of anxiety in the closing stages but Wasps were not to be denied. Victory keeps Dai Young’s resurgent side nicely placed in fourth, well set for the Premiership play-offs, although they will need to reinforce their defence if they are to maintain their upward trajectory. They were leading 33-17 with eight minutes left here, but opened up with alarming regularity in the closing stages so that Gloucester were able to secure two precious bonus points. Still, the club who were in such disarray on and off the field last year continue to threaten to bring back their European glory days. Young said: “We have not played well for 80 minutes all season but we’re still growing as a team and learning. We still have a lot to improve on and we are heading in the right direction. We are not hammering teams and we are having a little rub of the green. But we just have to keep on playing and getting the wins and the points. “It was an entertaining game for the neutral but we need to come out of the blocks quicker and make sure we’re not continuously playing catch up. We put ourselves out of sight but then Gloucester came back strongly near the end. We coughed the ball up and gave them a couple of opportunities and all of a sudden everyone is on their toes.”

Scrum-half Dan Robson helped Gloucester to make the perfect start. After full-back Rob Cook had kicked the visitors ahead, flanker Akapusi Qera broke through the Wasps defence before feeding Robson, who ran over unchallenged. A Stephen Jones penalty calmed the nerves of the Adams Park crowd, who were then on their feet to applaud flanker Ashley Johnson as he deployed his power and strength to go over for Wasps’ opening try. Gloucester played with flair, freedom and a desire to attack, but they were confronted by a set of Wasps forwards who were determined to let nothing past, and after Cook and Jones exchanged penalties, the hosts went in at half-time 13-10 ahead. Gloucester enjoyed some reward for their adventure in the second period, and they edged ahead when fly-half Ryan Mills fed Mike Tindall, who rediscovered some of his old pace to break through Chris Bell’s less than impressive tackle to run across the line. But Wasps’ resilience was never in doubt. Jones reduced Gloucester’s lead to a point before they were blown away in a devastating spell of rugby, which was sparked by the irrepressible Wade. Vunipola picked up a loose ball on halfway to feed the wing and, despite the pass arriving high, Wade collected smartly and dashed 50 metres for the line, evading Jonny May’s tackle in the process. Jones converted to give Wasps a 23-17 lead before Vunipola ­delivered his party piece in the 69th minute. The Australian-born 20-year-old smashed past two tackles from a scrum 15 metres out for the decisive try, with replacement Nick Robinson adding both the conversion and a subsequent ­penalty. “If you give Christian a bit of space there are very few better,” Young said. “People underestimate his strength and power and he has great footwork. If he keeps performing like that he will no doubt get his opportunity for honours. His try was crucial as it gave us the momentum and confidence to go on and win the match.” Gloucester director of rugby Nigel Davies refused to be too dejected at the end, preferring to focus on his side’s enterprise and late resilience, which yielded tries for Mills and Charlie Sharples. He said: “You like to think that when you score four tries away from home you will win the game 99 per cent of the time. Unfortunately, this was the one per cent. “We allowed them to take control of the game but we have managed to come away with two bonus points, having scored four tries. It is crucial to keep the points ticking over and this keeps us in the hunt for a top-four spot.”

Google Maps and Twitter mashup show UK snowfall
A Google Maps mashup that allows Twitter users to plot areas of UK snowfall is taking the internet by storm
Ben Marsh's website has used Google Maps with Twitter in order to provide updates about the heavy UK snow falls By Claudine Beaumont
12:03PM GMT 02 Feb 2009
Comments
The map, created by software programmer Ben Marsh, combines Google Maps with tagged Twitter messages. All Twitter users have to do is send a Tweet containing the first part of their postcode, and giving the snowfall a mark out of 10. It is then automatically displayed on Ben Marsh's Google Map, providing a real-time record of snowfall across the country. The site automatically updates every minute, and has received hundreds of tweets so far. London and the south-east is well represented on the map, with other parts of the country slowly joining in as the band of snow moves northwards. Twitter users should send their tweet in the following format: #uksnow [THEIR POSTCODE] [SCORE out of]/10.
The #uksnow hash-tag first appeared on Twitter late yesterday afternoon, and seems to have been created by Twitter user Julian Bray, who used the hash-tag in reponse to a tweet from TV presenter Philip Schofield , who was worried the blizzard might prevent him getting home. The hash-tag is also being used on the Flickr photo-sharing website, while Twitter's search engine facility is ranking the topic among its hottest trends , alongside such subjects as the Super Bowl and Fern Britton, who is having to present This Morning on her own today with a skeleton staff, much to the amusement of Twitter users working from home.
