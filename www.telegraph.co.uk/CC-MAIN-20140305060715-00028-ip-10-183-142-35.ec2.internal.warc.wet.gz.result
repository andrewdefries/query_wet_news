For the planning system to work, local communities need a level playing field
If local communities are to have faith in the planning system, then the system needs to recognise that there needs to be a much stronger local voice than currently exists, writes Chris Skidmore
Mr Boles says the projections for the households being created in this country were 'terrifying' Photo: Paul Grover for the Telegraph	By Chris Skidmore

Comments
Planning Minister Nick Boles’ speech at Policy Exchange set out a vision in which communities will have greater control and benefit over development in their neighbourhoods. In the minister’s speech was also the welcome and extremely important distinction, too frequently ignored, between ‘green belt’ land and green field land. There are only fourteen areas of green belt in the country, a total of 1,639,540 hectares, forming just 13 per cent of the countryside. If only 8 per cent of all land has been developed on, then there is clearly an argument that the Green Belt land can be preserved while at the same time finding room to build the necessary number of houses on green field for future generations. Green Belt land, having been given strengthened protected status in the National Planning Policy Framework, remains protected — something that the previous government’s Regional Spatial Strategies planned to remove in order to allow mass building on the Green Belt. Nick Boles has rightly made the consistent commitment that the Green Belt will be protected and ministers should continually remind people of this vital distinction. Equally, just as politicians should be careful not to demonise those unfortunate enough to find themselves in circumstances where they have to claim welfare as scroungers, we should caution against the cat calls of NIMBY for anyone concerned about the future of their local area and neighbourhood. What concerns people is not so much that there should be no housing at all, but that new houses should not be, in the words of the minister, "ugly rubbish", but beautiful and sensitive to their surroundings. While we must ensure that there are many thousands more homes for future generations to build secure lives of their own, we have a duty also to protect and conserve areas of natural beauty. This does not have to be exclusively reserved for the countryside, as former Tourism minister John Penrose has effectively pointed out; urban views of architectural significance and beauty have equal right to be retained for the future. Many local groups have already been working closely with local authorities to ensure that Core Strategies are put in place to determine the long term future of their areas, and today’s speech will encourage many that they will be added incentives for doing so. Yet there remains persistent problem that local communities can never be fully empowered when the planning system remains tilted in favour of developers who have a right to appeal planning decisions that go against them, when residents have none. According to recent Government statistics, in the last decade 8,663 planning applications were granted despite having significantly cut across agreed development plans. Although these are just 0.15 per cent of the six million submitted in this period, these figures only include applications for development large enough to have been referred to the Secretary of State. The problem is exacerbated when local authorities, the supposed democratic guardians of the planning process, are press ganged into accepting developments in fear of legal challenges that they cannot afford to defend. Recently, I introduced a 10 minute rule bill into Parliament calling for a Community Right of Appeal that would help level the playing field: local communities would be able to challenge a development contrary to local neighbourhood plans by proving that a significant proportion of the neighbourhood were strongly opposed to an application being passed in the form of a petition. This would reflect a certain proportion of a local ward, say 25 per cent of the electorate, which would trigger a right of appeal. This is hardly a new concept: a community right of appeal exists in Australia, for instance, and has had little impact on growth while at the same time ensures public confidence in the planning process. The introduction of such a community right of appeal was also a pre-election pledge both in the 2010 Conservative Party Green Paper Open Source Planning that talked of creating a ‘symmetrical’ planning structure and in the 2010 Liberal Democrat General Election Manifesto.

If local communities are to have faith in the planning system, rather than it being a top-down process in which neighbourhoods feel that they have no control of the developments forced upon them, then the system needs to recognise that there needs to be a much stronger local voice than currently exists.

It's time to teach hysterical parents the rules of sport
Parents on the touchline should be quiet until they've learned the rules
6:59AM GMT 14 Jan 2014
Comments
SIR – I have experienced many episodes of poor touchline behaviour from parents, and occasionally I have seen coaches try to bully their players into doing what they want them to do.
As a referee and prep school teacher, I used to hold lessons to explain the laws of rugby for parents. It was nearly always mothers who attended. One Saturday, there was a visiting parent who was giving me quite a lot of abuse from the touchline. After half time he went quiet. One of the mothers had explained to him that the law he was yelling about had been changed at the start of the season. On another occasion, as the team were leaving the field, I overheard a father remark to his son: “Why didn’t you get stuck in and tackle properly?” His son’s reply was: “You can play next week and see if you can do better.”
Young children only need praise and encouragement, and they will achieve. Tony Carroll

Doctors saying sorry
SIR – Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, is to be congratulated for his desire for the NHS to say sorry when things go wrong. Perhaps he can show leadership by apologising for his Government’s pointless and expensive management reorganisation of the service. Dr Robert Walker Great Clifton, Cumberland SIR – The Health Secretary wants doctors and nurses to say sorry when things go wrong. He might also encourage the health professionals by saying thank you for the occasions when things go right. Revd Peter Phillips Swansea, Glamorgan Stable relationship SIR – How very lucky we are in this country to live in a monarchy where our head of state is quite happy to have a string of racehorses, whereas France’s equivalent allegedly has a string of mistresses. David Scott
Corfe Castle, Dorset Mouse damage SIR – Once Penny Elles has had her mouse-gnawed dishwasher repaired, she might consider buying an ultrasonic rodent repeller. They plug into any socket and cost next nothing to run. Finally, I have no more mice. Nick Edge Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire SIR – We bought a Zanussi dishwasher in 1977 and after one year a mouse chewed a large hole in the bifurcated hose at the base of the wash chamber. With the imminent arrival of a German family for a two-week stay, I went to the local garage and bought a motorcycle puncture repair kit, and made what I thought would be a temporary repair. The machine has been trouble-free ever since. Laurie Walpole
Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire Potty parents
SIR – The extent of entitlement exercised by parents of toddlers reached a new low yesterday. As I had breakfast in a local cafe, a mother at the next table put her child on a potty – right next to me. Am I alone in thinking that this was really a step too far? Jacqueline Heywood Oxted, Surrey Living on benefits
SIR – At Channel Four, we take criticism seriously, especially from those helping vulnerable and minority communities. However, the letter from various charities criticising Benefits Street is based on one programme, when it is a five-part series made over 12 months. Different types of claimants live on the street: people suffering drug or alcohol addiction, victims of domestic abuse and people struggling to find work. All are represented in the series. Last night’s episode, focusing on Romanian immigrants, has already attracted sympathetic comments. The series has also already introduced the “50p man”, an entrepreneur who was offered two jobs following transmission, among other locals committed to doing public good. The series honestly reflects what happened over 12 months. While much is inspiring, some bits are uncomfortable to watch. I dispute that those featured represent “harmful stereotypes”. Living in an area of sustained unemployment, they need “support from benefits” as much as anyone. By watching the whole series, a complex portrait emerges of a community feeling the effects of benefit cuts, but one where neighbourliness and family are key, and where the frustrated appetite for work is as evident as a dependency on benefits. Nick Mirsky Head of Documentaries, Channel Four
London SW1 Opening the flood gates
SIR – At the upper reaches of the River Ray, the sluice gates have for once not been closed, reducing flooding and allowing water to flow freely down to the Thames towards Oxford at a much greater rate. Developers who are appealing against a refusal to build on the marshes and flood plain at the edge of our village must be delighted; those further down the Thames, in Oxford, Reading and Marlow, less so. Mark Longworth Ambrosden, Oxfordshire Password plea
SIR – We need passwords for everything. They are becoming more and more complex, requiring up to eight characters, alphanumeric combinations, or answers to “secret questions” such as the name of one’s primary school (I attended four). We are told not to use the same password twice, or to write them down. How are we supposed to remember them? Ann Ball
Lingfield, Surrey Housing shortage dictates rural planning policy SIR – I was dismayed to read “not in my back yard” letters about planning in rural areas. House prices have risen out of reach of most young people because of the shortage of houses being built – driven by our invitation to millions of people to migrate to this country. Not everyone can live on a redeveloped factory site or redundant railway siding. Wokingham, where I live, is doing more than its share. The countryside has to shoulder some of the burden too. Elizabeth Spooner
Wokingham, Berkshire SIR – The Liberal Democrats have been criticising the Tories for suppressing a plan to build two new garden cities because it would alienate their supporters. At least the Tories have finally woken up to the danger. They have already done an immense amount of damage to their mainstay supporters in the “shire” counties with the National Planning Policy Framework and the way it is being interpreted. The offending phrase “the assumption of sustainability” seems to mean that Defra can do what it likes. Doug Pennifold
Burgess Hill, West Sussex SIR – There seems to be a tendency in some Government circles to view the countryside as one vast potential building site, rather than as the precious and diminishing resource that it is. We need to stop the pursuit of endless growth and realise that a rapidly increasing population on an overcrowded island will lead to the destruction of the countryside if allowed to continue unchecked. The Government should drop its promotion of grandiose schemes such as HS2, another London airport, and the building of new towns and cities, and instead work towards a sustainable economy based on a steady or reducing population.

This would be ideal for anyone who wanted access to the sprawling grounds of a country pile, without the price tag. The three-bedroom house is set in the Regency wing of a Grade I listed Palladian villa. There are 27 acres of grounds, as well as communal buildings, including a wine cellar that would be ideal for a treasure hunt.

Easy as 1234: the most popular PIN codes revealed As anyone with more than one bank card will know, remembering a variety of PIN codes can be an impossible task.

It should perhaps comes as no surprise, therefore, that the most popular PIN in use has been found to be 1234. While some of us devise crafty combinations of numbers based on our pet’s birthday or the date of our wedding anniversary, research suggests that many people simply opt for the most memorable code they can think of. A study by the DataGenetics blog found the second most popular PIN was 1111, followed by 0000, 1212 and 7777. The digits zero to nine can be arranged in 10,000 possible ways to form a four-digit PIN code. But using data from security breaches and previously released or exposed password tables, the bloggers found that 11% of the 3.4 million passwords they looked at were 1234 – a proportion they described as “staggering” and betraying a "lack of imagination."

More than six per cent of the passwords were 1111. Many people also used the year of their birth to create their PIN, with every single combination of the digits in the years 1901 to 1999 occurring in the top fifth of the data set. The least common PIN code, meanwhile, was 8068, which occurred just 25 times in the study of 3.4 million codes. The bloggers warned that anyone with one of the most popular PINs should “apply common sense and immediately change them to something a little less predictable.”
Their research follows a cybercrime report in June revealing that criminals can buy personal details online for less than £20. Credit card details without PINs can be purchased for just £16, while a PIN costs £65. A credit card with PIN and a guaranteed good balance sells for £130, according to the security software company McAfee. Internet Security

M&S data breach: Five ways to beat phishing emails

Marks and Spencer is one of more than a dozen major brands affected by the theft of data held by Epsilon, an email marketing company based in Texas. The data is limited to email addresses and names, but criminals could use it in to trick more valuable information such as passwords from victims - a type of internet fraud known as "phishing". Internet security experts expects a spate of phishing attacks on the millions of individuals whose data was stolen from Epsilon in coming weeks. But there is no reason to be caught out: 1. Beware forgeries
Criminals can easily spoof the "From" field in emails, so if a message says it comes from customerservice@marksandspencer.com, that does not mean it really does. Related Articles

2. Suspect links
Phishing emails often encourage their targets to click on links to counterfeit websites that will then ask for valuable data. Savvy internet users don't click on links in unsolicited emails. 3. Inspect the URL
If you do click on links in emails check that the URL in your browser's address bar is what you expected. Check carefully, as criminals could obtain a web address that is only very slightly different from the legitimate Marks and Spencer website. 4. Check for encryption
Legitimate e-commerce websites use encryption to ensure your sensitive data cannot be intercepted. If a website asks you for data and your browser does not show a padlock symbol it may be a phishing attempt. Genuine websites that ask for financial information should also turn the address bar green in more recent browsers. 5. Never download Exercise extreme caution if a website you have visited from an email asks you to download anything. Some phishing attacks are designed to distribute computer viruses that will directly steal your banking information. Criminals can trick victims into downloading by disguising them as legitimate files. Internet
