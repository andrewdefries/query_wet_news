US woes hit Wolseley

US setbacks see dollar plunge to near 15-year low
Your view: Will the dollar hit $2 against sterling?
Wolseley is axing 2,000 US jobs in a clear sign that the plumbing giant anticipates more gloom for the world's largest economy. Wolseley has been a beneficiary of the US housing boom but the tide has now turned and the company is having to take drastic measures to ensure its building material and lumber operation reflects the new market dynamics. US house prices have fallen 10pc in the past year and the number of new housebuilding starts has collapsed from 2m annually to 1.5m. The crash is weighing on the economy, with US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke admitting yesterday that Washington does not know how bad the housing market really is. The dollar's slide to about $1.95 to the pound has been blamed on housing market woes, which may dent consumer spending and put a hole in corporate profits. Wolseley's exposure to US weakness is two-fold, as it loses out on the exchange rate, too. The extent of the US housing market crash has taken Wolseley by surprise, resulting in the 10pc staff reduction in its Stock housing materials arm. Wolseley said: "New housing starts have fallen more sharply than expected. This has impacted sales and profits. In response to the slowing market, significant management action has been taken with a major programme of cost reduction, lowering headcount by more than 10pc." Wolseley's decision is an implicit call on the future prospects of the US housing market, which will unsettle economists. It added: "The housing market is expected to continue to soften into 2007, but with significant regional variations." US housing market woes and the weak dollar combined to push Wolseley's US operating profit "slightly down" for the three months to October. Exchange rates reduced profits by 6pc. European markets fared better, with sales and operating profit gaining by more than 30pc. Trading in the UK was ahead by more than 10pc in sales, but profit margins were lower as a result of more aggressive price competition. Overall, profit before tax and amortization rose "only marginally" in the three months, Wolseley said. Sales advanced 15pc, with two-thirds of the gain coming from acquisitions. The shares climbed 4pc to £11.81. David Taylor, analyst at Teather & Greenwood, said: "We reduced our forecasts on 15 November and see this statement consistent with that, rather than something very new. Medium term, we are confident of the strength of the business model." Finance

Wife of jailed Russian oligarch vows to stand by her man

12:01AM BST 05 Jun 2005
The wife of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the jailed Russian billionaire oligarch, has vowed to continue visiting her husband in prison even if he is incarcerated in one of the country's far-flung gulags. Inna Khodorkovsky, who sobbed in court last week as her husband was sentenced to nine years, faces the prospect of him being sent to one of the remote Soviet-era prison camps in far eastern Russia. Asked how she would cope if he were held thousands of miles from the family home in Moscow, Mrs Khodorkovsky said: "I will certainly go to his penal colony, take a look around. We'll shuttle there and back to see him more often." Without her powerful husband by her side, she said, she has been forced to manage the family's affairs alone. Most of the people she thought she could rely on disappeared after Khodorkovsky was arrested in October 2003 and she has faced open hostility from Russian officialdom. "When the people we considered friends vanished it came as a shock. Now I don't regret it or miss them. A new life has to be created with new people come to fill the gaps." Bemoaning her treatment by the state, she added: "I discovered that our children had no residence certificates so I had to recover and file some documents. I obtained medical insurance papers for them. The women at the Housing Department complained a lot about me. They whispered among themselves, said nasty things and rejected my documents. But the people in the queue were always friendly - young and old people sympathised with me and helped me to fill out the forms." While international attention has focused on the trial's wider political fallout, Russians have been engrossed in the personal drama of how his wife has coped with becoming a prison widow. Many resent the enormous wealth of the oligarchs, who became billionaires in the 1990s after gaining control of former state assets after the fall of the Soviet Union. Khodorkovsky, the former head of the privatised oil company, Yukos, was convicted last week of tax evasion and fraud charges in what critics said was Kremlin-inspired revenge for his funding of opposition parties. He plans to appeal. Since his arrest at an airport in Siberia, his wife's sole contact with him has been through the reinforced glass screens of the prison visiting room at the notoriously overcrowded Matrosskaya Tishina remand centre in Moscow. Mrs Khodorkovsky, who has five-year-old twin boys, Gleb and Ilya, and a daughter, Nastya, 12, said that the younger children could not understand why they could not kiss or hug their father. On their first visit, the twins tried to smash the screen with the telephone to help their father to escape. "They really could not understand that this talk through the glass on the phone was their meeting with their father," she said. She never took them back. Her main concern is that Khodorkovsky's health will suffer under the prison regime. Jail conditions have improved little since Stalin's time, said Mrs Khodorkovsky, who takes food parcels to supplement his meagre diet. "The [food] list has not changed since 1930," she said. "For example, cucumbers and tomatoes are not allowed in winter. Fennel and parsley are allowed but lettuce is not. For some reason, they did not allow bringing medicines for a year, and then permitted it." In the remand centre Khodorkovsky has to share an airless cell with several men. Naum Nim, the editor of a Russian prison magazine, believes that jails will compete to accommodate him if his appeal fails, hoping to curry favour on his release. "Prison administrators are probably holding a contest to see who gets Khodorkovsky," Mr Nim told the Moscow Times. "They know he can pay for repairs and maybe even a new fitness room." Some Russian jails are known as "black prisons" - run by mafia inmates, who are allowed a free hand as long as they keep order. Khodorkovsky, however, is likely to serve his sentence in a "red prison", where the inmates' every move is monitored. He will be unable to conduct any business and would also struggle to get permission to write any memoirs of prison life. His best hope, advised Mr Nim, would be to bribe guards to give him his own cell, and to get a job in the prison library. Russia
