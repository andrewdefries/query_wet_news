Delon Armitage's behaviour was not in keeping with the spirit Toulon showed when winning the Heineken Cup
The majority of the audience for Saturday’s Heineken Cup final were technically neutral but few did not have a temporary allegiance for Clermont or Toulon. One giant leap: Delon Armitage crosses to score for Toulon against Clermont in the Heineken Cup final Photo: PA	By Brian Moore

The reason behind each choice was interesting and was fuelled by pre-match hyperbole about the composition of the teams, their players and their styles of rugby. Clermont were said to be the better team, capable of playing in a variety of ways and with a delicious amalgam of power up front and the dangerous running abilities of a back three that any club side would covet. The fact is that for most of the game Clermont were clearly the better side. Aurélien Rougerie made a nonsense of Mathieu Bastareaud’s man-of-the-match tag while he was on the field, shredding the Clermont line on several occasions and making a significant contribution to both his side’s tries. When you added the not inconsiderable touches of Wesley Fofana and Brock James you would have thought that when they led 15-6 they would smoothly cruise away to claim the European title that many thought was theirs for the asking. What transpired thereafter demonstrated the value, if further evidence were needed, of big-game experience. Toulon have been labelled a bunch of multinational mercenaries bought with the market-distorting chequebook of a comic-owning millionaire. This description may have a scintilla of truth but what many fail to understand is that you cannot achieve success by salary alone. Money cannot buy team unity; it does not forge the spirit that is necessary to face the teeth of the storm and fashion the collective will to resist the seemingly unbearable pressure and make the physical sacrifices needed to stay in the game.

Tale of the unexpected
18 May 2013
In Bakkies Botha, Chris Masoe and Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe Toulon possess three players who, while of advancing years, are denizens of the world of the enforcers. Their refusal to submit to ceaseless waves of Clermont runners, aided by Bastareaud’s impressive defensive effort in the final 15 minutes, meant they won a game they had no right to win – in any fair world. That this world does not exist in sport is one of its greatest attractions because it allows the mentally tough to triumph and it was there that Toulon based their victory. Jonny Wilkinson has his devotees and detractors in equal measure though the latter are more often than not inspired purely by the former and not any sound rugby reasons. He did his usual exemplary kicking from hand and at goal, something that critics dismiss as mundane when it is anything but. What most did not see but which is apparent from re-watching the game is the astonishing amount of work he did in defence, both front up and as a sweeper behind the first up line. Time and again he was the tackler who stopped a partial break becoming a full breach or was second man into the breakdown to slow the winning of the ball down by the crucial second needed for his team-mates to realign. Much has been said of Wilkinson’s frail body but on this evidence it can only be so if you judge it against the task of playing multiple successive games because in speed and power nothing was lacking. If Wilkinson does not receive a call from Warren Gatland, who has no reason not to chose a 38th squad member, the Lions will deprive themselves of a hugely experienced player who demonstrably is capable of keeping his head and closing out games in the last 20 minutes. In the end Toulon deserve great praise, as does coach Bernard Laporte, because any elite player will tell you that the spirit that was writ large in their Heineken Cup win is rare; it is certainly not something that you achieve in a couple of seasons. All of which makes the behaviour of Toulon full-back Delon Armitage all the more regrettable. A player possibly sufficiently gifted to go on this and the last Lions tour should not be the talking point of a game for any reason other than his rugby. Even accounting for Rougerie’s pat on the head in the first half, Armitage’s unprofessional taunting of James on the way to scoring Toulon’s crucial comeback try was poor. Many former and current players joined me in condemning Armitage on social media and while my tweet that said such mocking would have drawn a physical response was provocative, Armitage’s Wildean retort showed he has learnt nothing from his many previous outbursts. The attitude displayed in his abusive tweet, which said ‘any time you fat p----, go and write another s--- book’ is the reason England and the Lions are happy to leave him in France – which is a shame.

Google faces investigation over 'exclusive deals'
Brussels' antitrust watchdog is considering claims that Google made anti-competitive deals to promote Android Google's famous logo By Olivia Goldhill

Allegations include concerns that Google offered cut price licensing for the Android platform's open-source software to phone manufacturers, and benefited from exclusivity deals. According to documents seen by the Financial Times, the Brussels antitrust watchdog will look at “potential requests by Google to cancel and/or delay the launch of smartphone devices” in response to competing operating systems. The informal investigation, which is in an early stage, follows complaints in April from 14 companies, including Microsoft and Nokia, to the European Commission that Google was using “deceptive conduct to lock out competition in mobile”. Google's success in online mobile services such as search and Maps is partly owed to mobile phone manufacturers using Android as a platform. Devices with Android software made up 74 per cent of global smartphone sales in the first quarter, according to Gartner. Brussels's investigation into Android has been open for more than a year but the commission sent out a 23-page questionnaire on mobile operating systems and pre-installed services after Google's rival companies lodged the formal complaint. The questionnaire does not necessarily mean the commission will launch a formal investigation of Google's sales. Related Articles

Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, has not said the questionnaire and informal Android investigation are linked, but there is overlap between the complainants in both cases. A proposed antitrust settlement earlier this year from the EU competition commissioner on Google's search business has been criticised by rivals as having too many loopholes to be effective. The commission, which has the power to impose 10 per cent fines on global turnover, has said it will negotiate improvements on the settlement in the coming months but declined to comment on the questionnaire. Google said: “Android is an open platform that fosters competition. Handset makers, carriers and consumers can decide how to use Android, including which applications they want to use.”
