Profile: Mike Lynch, Autonomy founder
"I've never yet come across an engineer that can turn his hands to business," blasted Lord Sugar on his BBC show The Apprentice. <

MP accuses Government of ignoring needs of British business

'Engineer' Mike Lynch proved that pet theory wrong. A man of numbers, labelled "Britain's Bill Gates", who likes nothing better than a pint of beer in his local pub in rural Suffolk, spent much of his Cambridge PhD and subsequent fellowship studying the work of an 18th Century vicar, Thomas Bayes, who dedicated own his life trying to prove the existence of God through mathematics. Bayes pattern recognition techniques proved more useful at pulling meaning from electronic information than from scripture, Lynch found, and after developing a system for matching fingerprints for the Essex police force and another for reading car number plates, he set up Autonomy in 1996 to exploit the problem of unstructured data. "Autonomy makes technology that allows computers to understand what information means," Lynch told The Daily Telegraph last year, after complaining that it took at least three presentations before City analysts really got the potential of what he was doing. Lynch turned that observation into a FTSE 100 software company serving 16,000 clients that range from Nestle and the BBC to NASA and the US Department of Homeland Security. He mixed a hard headed, blunt approach to business with a sense of humour derived from his Irish roots and early years growing up in Chelmsford, Essex. He was worth around £400m according to the Sunday Times rich list even before any deal with HP. Related Articles

Born in Tipperary, his parents – his father, a fireman; his mother a nurse – moved to Essex when he was still a child. His intelligence helped him prosper, securing a scholarship to the nearby public school Bancroft's. Lynch credits his early years with defining his choice of careers. "One of the reasons I ended up where I am today is that I didn't know what a solicitor or an accountant did. We didn't have any in my family or social circle." He built a business instead. Growing Autonomy rapidly through acquisition – the last of US content management rival Interwoven for £559m in 2009, Lynch was long feted as the founder of Britain's leading technology company (before microchip specialist and Cambridge peer ARM Holdings joined the party). Yet he also had his doubters. Likened to Manchester City – before its billions – by one noted City commentator in 2001, Lynch had to fight hard to win credit from the City. A public row that year with Merrill Lynch, the investment bank, did not help. One of the bank's analysts suggested Autonomy had lost key staff to Microsoft and that the US giant was developing rival products. Lynch hit the roof and formally complained to the London Stock Exchange about Merrill's comments. "It is just about the worst thing that could happen," he complained. The City promptly closed ranks. Yet Lynch was right and Merrill formally apologised for factual errors in its advice note. Now known as a man with a "dismissive view of technology awareness among City professionals" and "academic arrogance", Lynch battled on and Autonomy prospered. Then a warning last October that its third quarter revenues would disappoint spooked investors and Lynch's standing again fell in line with Autonomy's stock. One Deutsche Bank analyst – a former Automony senior manager – piled in. His critique was damming: "The management structure, control and systems at Autonomy are more representative of a start-up than a major global player," he wrote. The City prefers professional managers groomed at BP and Proctor & Gamble. Hedge funds piled in, shorted the stock, despite rumours as early as last September that a US company was preparing a £5bn bid. At the time Lynch said: "We're sitting on a gold mine and we just need to get to the gold." Lynch has admitted that he is a work-a-holic, enjoying the challenge of running a global business from the UK; waking up with Asia and going to bed talking to colleague on the West Coast. His laptop sits on his bed side table. Industry

Syria: Barack Obama urges war-weary US to shoulder 'burdens of leadership'
President Barack Obama made the case for action in Syria directly to a deeply sceptical American public, arguing that the US must be prepared to shoulder "the burdens of leadership".
By Raf Sanchez, Washington
3:22AM BST 11 Sep 2013
Follow Although cautiously welcoming Russian proposals to oversee the decommissioning of Syria's chemical weapons, Mr Obama said the US military remained on alert "in case diplomacy fails". In a highly-publicised address delivered in television prime time from the White House, Mr Obama broke little new ground but instead tried to directly address the concerns of a nation "sick and tired of war". "The burdens of leadership are often heavy, but the world's a better place because we have borne them," he told an American public that opinion polls show are strongly opposed to military action. Mr Obama said the Russian initiative, as well as the Assad regime's offer to join a treaty banning the use of chemical weapons, were "encouraging signs". Although cautioning that it was "too early to tell whether this offer will succeed" Mr Obama said the initiative had "the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force".

"I have therefore asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorise the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path," Mr Obama said, explaining his decision to at least temporarily halt America's march to war.

He did not acknowledge surveys of members of Congress which show him likely to suffer a humiliating defeat if he attempted to secure the backing of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The president made no ultimatums to Bashar al-Assad, nor did he set any specific timetable on how quickly Syria would need to prove its offer was credible in order to avoid strikes. However, he warned: "I've ordered our military to maintain their current posture, to keep the pressure on Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails."
The president said he would work with Britain and France to try to pass a UN resolution that would require the regime to hand over and destroy its chemical weapons. That effort made little progress today when Russia called off a meeting to discuss the proposed resolution. Mr Obama said he would give UN chemical weapons inspectors time to finish their report on what happened during the August 21 attack and continue to try to build an international coalition.

The bulk of the 15-minute speech was spent trying to address the fears of ordinary Americans who will on Wednesday mark the 12th anniversary of the September 11 attacks and the constant fighting the US has engaged in since. He repeated his pledge that he would "not put American boots on the ground in Syria" and said that even though the strikes would not remove the regime they would "send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver". The president warned that failing to challenge the use of chemical weapons would endanger US allies like Israel and could one day mean they would be used against American troops on the battlefield. Mr Obama urged both members of Congress and the American people to watch the videos of the August 21 attack in Damascus and ask: "What kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas and we choose to look the other way?"
The president closed with an appeal to American exceptionalism, saying for that for "nearly seven decades the United States has been the anchor of global security." "This has meant doing more than forging international agreements. It has meant enforcing them," Mr Obama said. Syria

All fired up: the future of pottery
Once the world capital of ceramics, Stoke-on-Trent has seen its pottery industry dashed to smithereens. David Nicholls meets the new breed of manufacturers who are picking up the pieces and putting its china back on the map.

Comments
In the 18th century a fortuitous supply of clay, coal and canals coupled with the ambitions of great innovators such as Josiah Wedgwood propelled the ceramics industry of the Potteries – the group of six Staffordshire towns that would become the city of Stoke-on Trent – to the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. At its peak in the late 19th century the region was the epicentre of the world’s ceramic production, home to more than 2,000 kilns firing millions of products a year. But within 100 years a sharp decline in British manufacturing, which led to the closure of mines, steelworks and factories, brought Stoke, and the industry that was integral to its identity, to its knees. As recently as the 1970s there were 200 factories still operating in the area; today there are about 30. Between 1998 and 2008 the Potteries lost more than 20,000 jobs. When Wedgwood – the sacred cow of Staffordshire ceramic production – called in the administrators and shut down its factory in 2009, it seemed to sound the death knell for the beleaguered industry. The widespread hand-wringing about the state of Stoke-on-Trent is understandable, but thanks to a number of manufacturers who are staging a strong fightback we must avoid the urge to write the Potteries’ epitaph just yet. One of these is the formidable Emma Bridgewater, who came to the area in 1985 in search of a pottery to produce her designs. What she found was an industry in disarray, crippled by 'bad 1970s-style management’. It was never her intention to be a manufacturer, but when the maker she had been using went bust in 1992 she stepped in and bought the factory, keeping its 35 staff on. Within five years her friendly, sponge-painted tableware designs (particularly her Polka Dot pattern) were in such demand that the company outgrew the premises and bought the much larger former Johnson Brothers factory on the Caldon Canal. Today Bridgewater is the most high-profile member of Stoke-on-Trent’s new guard, and has championed British manufacture on television (Newsnight) and radio (Woman’s Hour), while the success of her company is a recurrent theme of newspaper business pages. What motivates Bridgewater is the unrealised potential that she sees in the region. 'What we need to do is roll our sleeves up and get to work,’ she says. 'And if we are going to make it here in Stoke-on-Trent, then we need to make it well. I’m not interested in making the cheapest mug.’
Her tactics are clearly working. At the end of the recession Emma Bridgewater’s profits were up by 40 per cent, and over the past 18 months she has increased her staff from 220 to 265. The company produces more than 5,000 mugs, bowls and plates every day. 'I’m aware we are a global economy, but there is a lot to be said for jobs closer to home,’ she says. 'Our success proves that companies really can still be successful at manufacturing in this country.’

Bridgewater’s husband, the artist Matthew Rice, is responsible for several of the pottery’s patterns, and for the past two years has been the company’s managing director. Rice is equally passionate – and outspoken – about the region. Two months ago he publicly criticised Stoke-on-Trent’s 'feckless’ city planning and demanded that the council begin to regenerate rather than tear down the area’s historic buildings and factories. A few miles down the road is the Portmeirion pottery, which was founded 50 years ago by Susan Williams-Ellis, the daughter of the architect Clough Williams-Ellis, who created the village of Portmeirion in north Wales. The pottery’s success is based on its casual earthenware tableware ranges, which account for nearly three quarters of the company’s ceramic business. Williams-Ellis’s most famous designs include the Totem and Magic City coffee services from the 1960s, but Portmeirion’s singular biggest earner is Botanic Garden. The pretty floral-and-leaf-bordered pattern, based on antique botanical illustration plates, has been in production since 1972. When Portmeirion acquired the historic pottery firm Spode in 2009 (at the same time it also acquired Royal Worcester and Pimpernel, and formed the Portmeirion Group) it took the bold step of reversing the region’s manufacturing trend – it actually returned some of Spode’s production from China and Malaysia to Stoke. This was no mere marketing exercise or nod to sentimentality, but a shrewd business move. Today about 30 per cent of the products within Spode’s iconic Blue Italian range are once again being made in the same town where Josiah Spode established his company in 1770, and production is up some 20 per cent. As a result, 39 new jobs have been created and 15 of these have been filled by former Spode employees who had been made redundant when the firm collapsed. On top of this is the belief is that the reinstatement of the Made in England stamp on the bottom of a Blue Italian tea cup will bring back some of the cachet that had been lost. Spode’s Woodland pattern from 1986 is lined up as the next design to be returned to the Stoke production line. 'We are good at production,’ Julian Teed, the creative director of the Portmeirion Group, says. 'And we are prepared as a company to spend money because investment in the factory is imperative if we are going to keep production in Stoke.’
In many ways the manufacturing process is the same as it was 200 years ago. In all, 22 pairs of hands will have touched each piece of pottery by the time it is packed and dispatched. But there have been significant technological developments that have increased efficiency and allowed Portmeirion to compete with other markets. In one area of the factory floor, robotic arms acquired from the car industry have been reprogrammed to move heavy ceramic pieces from machine to machine. The company has also been thinking 'green’ recently, which is somewhat challenging in an industry reliant on burning fuels in order to maintain extremely high temperatures. In the past 10 years the Portmeirion Group has cut its carbon footprint by about 40 per cent. While Emma Bridgewater, Portmeirion and Spode illustrate how it is still possible to produce relatively high volumes for the mass market in Stoke, there is an equally significant number of smaller companies that are using the expertise and heritage of the region to produce work for a very different audience. A particularly exciting example is the New English, a Stoke-based company that is more ceramics design house than manufacturer. It was set up in 2009 by Judith and Paul Bishop, who lived locally, had experience in creative and 'innovations’ businesses, and were passionate about the area and its potential. 'We could have bought a factory,’ Paul says. 'But Stoke-on-Trent doesn’t need more capacity. What it needs is more demand.’ So he set about generating it. The idea was to bring original modern designs to a local producer. Bishop sought out one of the most highly regarded fine bone china specialists in the area, Caverswall, to produce the goods. Although its reputation is excellent (it was awarded a royal warrant in 2008 and produces bone china for companies including Liberty, Paul Smith and Burberry) the Caverswall factory and its employees have had to be flexible in order to survive. For most, the working week is three to four days. But the partnership with the New English is providing an important new contribution to the workload. The New English works with new names and independent designers, applying innovative decorations to classic ceramic shapes: Crusades by Terri McGettigan uses the imagery of the crucifixion and the war plane; Inkhead by Florian Hutter is a range that is 'tattooed’ with rose and skull motifs. It may not be the place to look for a dinner service like the one your grandmother used, but it is being snapped up by design and gallery shops around the world. When Harrods decided to develop its own-brand fine bone china range, it turned to the New English to design and produce it. The result is the Knightsbridge collection, decorated in gold and platinum, which launched last month. Like Bridgewater, Paul Bishop believes that the idea of competing with foreign producers on price is wrong. 'We can’t compete with those volumes and maintain high-end production values,’ he says. 'We are not competing with Ikea. The Far East can do great things, but their approach to design has some way to go.’ What each of these companies is proving is that it is possible to make a serious business in Stoke, and it is their ability not only to make but also to innovate that is securing their future. There are other signs of hope amid the uncertainty in the area. A few months ago Burleigh Pottery – whose trademark blue-and-white ceramics are produced in the last working Victorian pottery in Stoke-on-Trent – was bought by the Derbyshire-based firm Denby. The company immediately recruited additional staff and has committed to keeping the factory going. And there is no denying the potential that a royal wedding can hold for any business with a commemorative memorabilia range in mind. Designers at Emma Bridgewater had samples ready within 24 hours of the announcement. Breaking the mould A selection of young designers who are looking to the expertise of the Stoke-on-Trent potteries to help realise their contemporary ceramic creations: Andrew Tanner produces his own collection of ceramics and is also the head of design for the Stoke-based Royal Stafford and Poole Pottery. He was named Young Design Entrepreneur of the Year 2009 by the British Council (andrewtannerdesign.co.uk). Reiko Kaneko is a tableware and accessories designer who adds a Japanese twist to traditional English fine bone china (reikokaneko.co.uk). We Love Kaoru Kaoru Parry works with small independent family-run potteries to create her fine bone china pieces. Her work also includes elements that are helping to preserve dying skills in Stoke, such as ceramic flower making (welovekaoru.com). Katy Potts The appropriately named designer specialises in teapots, some of which are hand-enamelled, a finish that was common in the 1920s and 30s. Each is made in Longton – an area of Stoke known for its makers of collectable teapots (katypotts.com).

Margate and its new Turner Contemporary art centre
As the Turner Contemporary art centre opens in Margate this week, Joanne O'Connor finds an 'imperfect' seaside resort – but one that has much to love.

The sun is shining on Margate's Harbour Arm. At the end of the stone pier the BeBeached Café is doing a brisk trade, serving its signature brunch of baked eggs, spinach and mushrooms. Outside, young coffee-sipping customers sit in deckchairs, basking in the unexpected warmth of the early spring sunshine. Across the water, the morning sea mists drift along the beach, drawing a discreet veil over the arcades, kebab shops and skeletal remains of the Dreamland amusement park, which disappears in the vapour like the ghost of summers past. A couple of hundred metres to the left of this spectre, perched jauntily on the harbour, looking out to sea, is an angular, glass-clad building. This, if all the hype is to be believed, is the shape of Margate's future. Turner Contemporary is an ambitious arts centre which, it is hoped, will do for the Kent seaside town's fortunes what the Tate did for St Ives in Cornwall and the Guggenheim for Bilbao. For a building that carries such a weight of expectations, it seems remarkably low-key, functional even. "It looks like a fish processing plant," said one local shopkeeper. Businesslike it may be, but I like the way the opaque façade reflects the sky and helps to merge the building with its watery surroundings. Related Articles

UK beach holidays: guide to the coast and seaside – Kent The gallery will be opened by Margate's most famous daughter, Tracey Emin, on April 16, but I was given a preview as the first artworks were being installed. Inside, the lofty reception area makes the most of the sea views while in the galleries, skylights and high windows filter in the northern light. These are the same views, the same light that so captivated J M W Turner – the gallery is built on the exact site of the guesthouse where the artist used to stay on his regular visits to Margate. Some of Turner's most famous works were inspired by Thanet – the coastal area which comprises Margate and the neighbouring resorts of Broadstairs and Ramsgate – but only one of his paintings will be on show in the opening exhibition, which is a collection of contemporary works very loosely inspired by the artist. From the gallery I walked into the Old Town, an attractive area of narrow cobbled streets behind the harbour. When I last visited Margate six years ago this area was down-at-heel and deserted, with many boarded-up shop windows. Today, it is home to a thriving community of independent shops specialising in vintage and retro homeware and clothing, art galleries and cafés, many of which have opened in the past 12 months. I chatted to at least half a dozen shopkeepers and each of them said that the "Turner effect" was a major factor in their decision to set up shop here. In its first year Turner Contemporary is expected to bring 150,000 visitors to Margate. The newest addition to the Old Town is Greedy Cow, a deli specialising in fine cheeses, charcuterie, artisan breads and real coffee, which opened last month next door to the Cupcake Café on Market Place. Rachel, the owner, is Margate born and bred, but moved away for many years. "If someone had said a couple of years ago that I would be moving back to Margate I would have said they were crazy," she says. "But I've noticed a change in the town. There's a real buzz." Across the square, Julian Newick is another returnee. Having spent years in Paris, he came home last year to open the Lifeboat Ale and Cider House, a cosy, rustic bar with an open fire, specialising in real ales, ciders and wines from east Kent. The bar has regular live music sessions and serves traditional food such as Kentish blue cheese, pies and seafood. Julian is passionate about sourcing local ingredients and hopes to start a weekly food market in the square. On King Street, I walked into Margate Modern Art, a smart gallery specialising in art from 1870 to 1970, which opened six months ago. The proprietor, Jane Holbrey, moved from France to open the gallery. When I commented that Margate must seem a bit of a culture shock, she laughed: "Well, I used to live in Brick Lane before it was gentrified, and it had a similar sort of feel."
Modern art, cupcakes, charcuterie… it's all a long way from the popular image of Margate as the seedy and neglected town that holidays forgot. Then again, maybe not such a long way. Just a minute's walk from the Old Town and you are back on the seafront, which, sadly, does not seem to have changed much since I last visited. But here too there is a promise of better times ahead, with plans to reopen Dreamland – which closed in 2005 – as a heritage theme park. It's hard to believe now, but in the Nineties this was one of the country's most popular attractions, pulling in two million visitors a year. The centrepiece of the new park, which is expected to open in 2013, will be the restored Scenic Railway, the oldest roller-coaster in Britain, which will be joined by vintage rides and amusements such as a Pinball Parlour, roller disco and a Fifties-style milk bar. Work has already started on the Thirties Dreamland Cinema which will house a new entertainment venue and an exhibition on the popular culture of the British seaside. Sarah Vickery, an old friend of mine, is a director of the Dreamland Trust, which has been campaigning to save the park. We met for tea at Batchelors Patisserie, a time-warp café with original Formica tables. Sarah believes Dreamland will be more important to Margate's regeneration than the Turner Contemporary. "For years the emphasis has been on promoting Margate as this arty destination and its incredible seaside heritage has been neglected," she says. Sarah owns the Shell Grotto, one of those strange and beguiling attractions the British seaside does so well. It was discovered in 1835 beneath a back garden in a quiet street and is an extraordinary underground cavern decorated with more than four million shells, arranged in beautiful and intricate patterns. The fact that nobody knows who created it, or why, only adds to the sense of mystery. Margate was one of Britain's earliest seaside resorts and there are reminders of its heyday, from the grand Georgian terraces to the stone pier built for the steam packets which brought Londoners in their thousands to try the fashionable new pastime of sea bathing. On the seafront at Cliftonville, once considered the posh part of town, stands the Walpole Bay Hotel, a gloriously eccentric remnant from the Edwardian era serving cream teas on an Art Deco veranda overlooking the bowling green, while the Victorian Nayland Rock Shelter on the promenade, where T S Eliot wrote parts of The Wasteland, has Grade II listed status. It had been a day of surprises, but the biggest surprise of all awaited me when I checked into my b & b later that day. The Reading Rooms opened 18 months ago on a Georgian square a five-minute walk from the seafront. The owners, Louise Oldfield and Liam Nabb, who have a background in music and graphic design, moved here from London, tempted by the town's affordable Georgian housing. "We wanted to create something special, that would stand on its own as a reason to come to Margate," Louise says. The 18th-century town house has been converted from 10 bedsits into an elegant guesthouse with three large bedrooms, decorated in shades of cream and ivory, with large French-style beds, chandeliers, stripped floorboards, and bathrooms which would put many five-star hotels to shame. Guests can order from an extensive breakfast menu and have it delivered to their room, at whatever time they like. It's a bold move, to open a boutique b & b in a place like Margate, but the couple's bravery has paid off, with weekends booking up long before the Turner gallery was completed. It's a difficult place Margate, imperfect and unpolished, but there is much to love. The sweeping expanse of the Main Sands is arguably one of the best beaches in the South East, and the skies which so famously captivated Turner really are extraordinary. Lovers of all things retro will delight in Scott's Furniture Mart – Kent's largest emporium of antique furniture, bric-a-brac and vintage clothing – and in the quirky shops of the Old Town. And the recent influx of artists and creative types has given the town a dynamism which is lacking in more gentrified resorts such as nearby Whitstable, with its twee shops and fishman's cottages. The Turner Contemporary will bring some much-needed publicity to the town and, if successful, the Dreamland heritage park will introduce a new generation to the simple pleasures of ghost trains, candyfloss and penny arcades. I hope so. It seems fitting that the blend of seaside kitsch and kiss-me-quick fun that saw Margate fall so spectacularly out of fashion could yet be its salvation. Margate basics Where to stay
