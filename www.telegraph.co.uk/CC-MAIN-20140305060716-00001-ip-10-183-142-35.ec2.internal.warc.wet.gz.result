Twitter signs advertising deal with CBS
Twitter has signed a major advertising partnership with CBS, the US broadcaster, as it battles to convince potental investors that it can translate its burgeoning network of users into revenues.

The social media company, which is preparing to float for up to $15bn, announced the deal at Advertising Week in New York on Monday, in its first public pitch since it announced its plans to make an initial public offering. Companies that buy ad space on the network will also be invited to sponsor one-minute clips from CBS’s shows, which will appear in the Twitter feeds of people who are likely to be interested. The audience will be chosen based on whether they have talked about the show on Twitter, or on other data that suggest they may be interested. Most social networks set themselves up as rivals to broadcasters, trying to persuade advertisers who plough their marketing budgets into traditional TV ads that the money would be better spent online. However, Twitter is doing the opposite and trying to woo advertisers by positioning itself as a tool that will help them make the most of traditional TV ads, which still suck up the lion’s share of marketing dollars. Matthew Derella, Twitter’s vice-president of sales, told the assembled marketing executives that the social network produced a “tidal wave” of valuable chatter that could be harnessed commercially to boost television shows, or the brands advertising around them. “If you’re a network working to drive [audience] engagement and ratings, this is a very powerful opportunity,” he said, delivering a well-rehearsed sales patter. “This is word of mouth marketing at scale.”

The San Francisco-based company is under pressure to persuade the advertising industry that they need to pay for advertising on Twitter, rather than simply using the social network as a free platform for PR. Twitter has more than 200m users who collectively send more than 400m tweets a day, but it has sometimes struggled to monetise them effectively. It has stepped up efforts over the past two years, with the introduction of a few different advertising products, but it now faces unpreceneted pressure to demonstrate that it can persuade companies to pay for ads on Twitter, without bombarding users with ads in a way that will alienate them. Twitter’s S-1, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of the IPO, will remain sealed until early next month, but analysts estmate that the company will clock up more than $500m in revenues this year and double that figure in 2014.

Luis Suárez handball controversy: ESPN reprimand Jon Champions over 'cheat' comments
ESPN commentator Jon Champion has been reprimanded by the FA Cup rights holders after describing Luis Suarez as a ‘cheat’ following his controversial hand-ball goal during Liverpool’s third round victory at Mansfield on Sunday. Talking point: Luis Suárez's second-half goal at Field Mill should have been disallowed Photo: GETTY IMAGES	By Telegraph Sport

Suarez received widespread criticism following the incident, which saw the Uruguayan control the ball with his right hand before scoring past goalkeeper Alan Marriott. The Liverpool forward’s actions prompted Champion to remark in commentary, "That, I'm afraid, is the work of a cheat." Champion’s summariser, Chris Waddle, appeared to be taken aback by the comments and ESPN have now issued a statement to confirm that Champion has been spoken to about his observations. The ESPN statement said: "We take our responsibility to deliver the highest standards of coverage to our viewers. ESPN’s editorial policy is for commentators to be unbiased and honest, to call things as they see them. “Inevitably this can involve treading a fine line on occasion, especially in the heat of the moment. Comments during the Mansfield v Liverpool match caused offence where none was intended and we have spoken to our commentator about this incident.” Related Articles
