Woman killed in shooting spree as she celebrated birthday with friends
Police have launched a murder inquiry after a shooting spree ahead of the Notting Hill Carnival left one woman dead as she celebrated her birthday.

Follow Sabrina Moss, who turned 24 on Friday, and was out with friends in Kilburn High Road, north London, when she was shot dead in the early hours of Saturday. A senior detective said Miss Moss was believed to have been an innocent party who was "in the wrong place at the wrong time". The incident took place just two miles from the route of the carnival, which opens on Sunday. Another woman was injured but her injuries are not life-threatening, a Scotland Yard spokesman said. Det Ch Insp John Sandlin said: "Enquiries continue to establish the full circumstances of this tragic incident. Related Articles

"At this early stage, I believe the two women were innocent parties who were caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. "I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the shooting, or who saw anything suspicion in the Kilburn area early this morning, to call police."
One resident said he was "terrified" as five or six shots were fired in the back garden of his home at 5am on Saturday. The crime took place about two miles from Notting Hill just hours before the start of the annual festival. Kilburn serves as an overspill area and an important transport hub during the two day event. A post-mortem examination will take place later. Police will launch one of their largest operations of the year at the carnival. This year the Met is deploying "super recognisers" for the first time this year - or officers with the ability to remember hundreds of offenders' faces. The 17 officers can recall the faces, names, birth dates and other details of offenders - sometyimes years after seeing them either in person or on file. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the "super recognisers" would be in CCTV control rooms looking for anyone whose bail conditions prohibit them from being at the event, as well as identifying opportunists committing crime amid the crowds. The Met's "super recognisers" came to prominence during the investigation into the August 2011 riots, when a small number of officers were responsible for identifying 28 per cent of suspects captured on CCTV. One super recogniser alone identified nearly 300 offenders. Crime

China to build English market town China is to build a fake English market town where the Chinese language is banned. Thames Town on the banks of the Yangtze River near Shanghai was opened amid much fan fare in 2006 Photo: EPA	By Peter Simpson in Beijing 2:35PM GMT 15 Dec 2011
Comments
The settlement will demand its residents and visitors to speak only English with those caught gossiping in shops or at the bus stop in their native Chinese punished.
"We plan to build in the European architectural style of the English city. The town will be divided into 16 city blocks, with a castle," said senior Miyun County official Wang Haichen.
"When people arrive in the town, it will be like going abroad. They have to get a 'passport' which has to be stamped," he added.
Four miles of polluted rivers running through 1,000 acres of blighted semi-rural land will be restored and landscaped into scenic standards becoming of the English countryside, said Mr Wang.
However, those who ask to hire a punt on the planned navigable waterways in Chinese or speak the local lingo anywhere in the English-only haven, will feel the long arm of the law, he warned.

The planned site for a fake slice of England's green and pleasant land is located just over an hour's drive from Beijing and lies in the shadow of the Great Wall.
Mr Wang said the development will help the area become a sophisticated ecotourist destination and lure the middle classes seeking to boost their linguistic skills in an English-inspiring, green setting.
And he said the development will help compensate for the worsening slump in the construction and industry sectors.
Miyun government figures show a 30 per cent drop since January in the county's once thriving real estate sector.
Mr Wang unveiled the county's anglophilisim at the Communist-run Miyun County Fifteenth People's Congress, a major regional government meeting, on Thursday.
Mock English towns and other affected European-styled property developments are constructed as gimmicks to attract China's middle classes seeking urbanity and a boost to their property portfolio.
Thames Town on the banks of the Yangtze River near Shanghai was opened amid much fan fare in 2006, boasting mock tutor brick homes, a pub, chippy, privet hedges, manicured lawns and leafy roads.
Five years on however, the complex is a near ghost town and draws mainly newly weds seeking a novel backdrop for their wedding photos.
American English may be more widely taught than The Queen's in Chinese classrooms, but all things British remain a benchmark for style and standards for many Chinese. China

Bayern are fully prepared for an 'arrogant' Mourinho
By Christopher Davies in Wolfsburg
12:01AM BST 04 Apr 2005
Comments
Germany's national newspaper, Bild, did not mince its words. "And you thought Bayern were arrogant? Meet Chelsea's manager-lout" was the headline while underneath were some of Jose Mourinho's more outrageous quotes, with spin that ensured the Portuguese looked even more of an egotist than he is. The latest episode in 'Josegate', the seemingly never-ending saga of Mourinho versus UEFA, is that Mourinho is apparently so unhappy with the lack of loyalty shown by Chelsea and chairman Bruce Buck at not fighting his two-game suspension he is threatening to quit at the end of the season - an unusual way, if true, of showing loyalty to the club. The story, initially in the Portuguese press, soon made its way round Europe and was devoured with relish in Germany, the media stoking the verbal fire as Bayern Munich prepared for Wednesday's visit to Stamford Bridge with a stroll in the sun, beating VfL Wolfsburg 3-0. Mourinho does not talk to the English media these days but enjoys a closer relationship with the Portuguese press so it would be unusual for them to fabricate such a story without a well-placed leak. Bayern coach Felix Magath was intrigued. "If it is true he could leave, it could cause a lot of problems, a lot of trouble at the club," he said after the victory in Wolfsburg.

Mourinho sent chief scout Andre Villas Boas, unsurprisingly banned from speaking to the press, to the Volkswagen Arena to run the rule over Bayern, who maintained their position at the top of the Bundesliga in a canter. First-half goals by Bastian Schweinsteiger - a right-foot volley from Torsten Frings' centre - and an unfortunate own goal by Kevin Hofland enabled the visitors to, in the words of Frings, "step down a gear, which helped us prepare for Chelsea". Frings got the slightest of touches to Schweinsteiger's left-wing cross to head Bayern's third in a game that became little more than a glorified training session for the superior Bavarians. Left-back Bixente Lizarazu said: "I think it is not always so easy to win like this here in Wolfsburg so we are very happy about the result. This was a perfect preparation for Chelsea. It will be a very interesting contest between two very good teams in Europe. "I would say that the style of the two teams is a little bit the same so it will be interesting to see what happens. "Chelsea have very good organisation, a very strong defence, and we know they play 'controlling' football. They have very quick players so are always a team that is very difficult to play. But we are a little bit the same, you know. We are playing the same way..." Lizarazu was wary of becoming involved in Chelsea's internal politics. "It has been difficult for them, but this is not really our problem," he said. "We don't care about that. We are playing a game against one of the best teams in Europe. "I don't know how it will affect the team for the coach not to be in the dressing room. I was never in such a situation so I do not know. You have to speak to the players of Chelsea but for us it does not matter." Bayern will be without Claudio Pizarro (hamstring). Sebastian Deisler or Mehmet Scholl will probably replace the promising Schweinsteiger in midfield or Magath may play both in a 4-5-1 formation with Roy Makaay a lone striker. Makaay came off in the 56th minute and did not take part in yesterday's training because of problems with a thigh muscle but the Holland striker is optimistic he will be fit to face Chelsea. "I hope so," said Magath. "A complete loss of our attack would be quite problematic." Football

Hull City defender Paul McShane tastes glory of promotion after suffering pain and rejection One moment Paul McShane was nudging in the goal that seemingly would send Hull City back to the Premier League. Half an hour later, McShane crouched in the tunnel with his team-mates, considering the possibility of an immediate future in the Championship play-offs.

Then Leeds United scored at Watford in the delayed game and Hull were up. McShane’s goal — even though it was not a winner — proved to be decisive. One moment Paul McShane was nudging in the goal that seemingly would send Hull City back to the Premier League . Half an hour later, McShane crouched in the tunnel with his team-mates, considering the possibility of an immediate future in the Championship play-offs. Then Leeds United scored at Watford in the delayed game and Hull were up. McShane’s goal — even though it was not a winner — proved to be decisive. At the moment of reckoning, the defender thought about both the glory and the pain. High in the stands there were the proud, smiling faces of more than a dozen family and friends. Absent, though, was his father, Sean, a former Dublin hurler, who died suddenly in 2010 aged 65 from a blood clot after routine ankle surgery. There was the private torment associated with suffering such a loss, but solace could not be found in a professional career. Two months after his father’s death, McShane was relegated from the Premier League with Hull. Later, with the arrival of Nigel Pearson as manager, and Nick Barmby after him, there seemed to be no future for the defender on Humberside. In the 2011-12 season, he made just one appearance. Reluctantly, he agreed loan moves to Barnsley and Crystal Palace. Related Articles

In one of the few quiet corners of the KC Stadium on Saturday afternoon, McShane still in his full muddied kit, shin pads and boots, recalled his story with a man of the match award in one hand and a bottle of beer in the other. “You train every day at your hardest and you’re not even considered, which is very frustrating,” he said. “Some people at the club wouldn’t talk to me at one stage because I was deemed as a bad egg or something because I wasn’t playing. “I was really contemplating it, just getting in my car, getting on the boat and going back to Ireland because it was just wall after wall that I kept hitting. But I kept going and that’s what you’ve got to keep doing, for yourself more than anything. I was giving my all so I could hold my head up.” With the appointment of Steve Bruce as manager last summer, McShane’s fortunes changed. In suffering rejection, the pair had something in common. Bruce was still smarting from his sacking at Sunderland. Talks were scheduled between Bruce and all squad members. “We had a remarkable conversation where Paul said he’d never trusted any manager he had worked under,” Bruce said. “I asked him to give me a chance because he had something to offer for certain. He never gave up and has a big heart. He’s had some stick and a difficult couple of years. But he’ll be the first one I speak to in the next couple of weeks and offer a new contract.”
McShane helped Hull to promotion by starting many games on the left side of a back three. Against Cardiff, Bruce switched the formation with McShane as a left-back and Robbie Brady, the player who usually fills that position, operating admirably as an emergency centre-forward. Bruce probably knows this current squad would not be strong enough to succeed in a Premier League survival mission. “You have to win 10 games. That sounds easy, but it’s not,” Bruce said. “If we think we’ll be signing people for £15 million, then we are far mistaken. If you’re trying to get a player like that, then he will have five or six clubs to choose from. You bring them here and burn huge money. I won’t do that to the chairman. “If you get people on big contracts, then you’re lumbering your club. There won’t be anything silly. Otherwise, it would be a Portsmouth.”
“We can do a Wigan Athletic or a West Bromwich Albion, building the club and making it stronger and put it in a healthy situation. To do that you need trust, and I know the trust of the owner is there.” That owner, Assem Allam, an Egyptian-born industrialist, bought Hull two years ago when the club was four days from bankruptcy. He described achieving promotion as one of “the proudest” moments in his life.

Five things Hull need to do
By Arindam Rej
1. Buy a striker
Hull’s attacking football has often been blunted by their own final-third failings, with Nick Proschwitz having struggled to adapt and Jay Simpson being a workhorse provider but not a finisher.
2. Keep the manager
Steve Bruce has departed quickly from clubs before and his stock is rising again. Even if Hull struggle, he is still the highest-calibre boss they could realistically hope for.
3. Maintain tactical versatility
Bruce has sprung surprises with his team selections and tactics, including the shock decision to ditch their wing-backs system against Cardiff, and must keep being instinctive even against the bigger clubs.
4. Make loans permanent
Hull’s most dangerous player this season, winger Ahmed Elmohamady, needs to stay put, while the likes of goalkeeper David Stockdale and midfielder George Boyd, practically a done deal, need to be tied up.
5. Be financially prudent
The long term must be considered to avoid any financial difficulties should they go down again with no repeat of contracts such as the £45,000-a-week, five-year one given to Jimmy Bullard five years ago.
