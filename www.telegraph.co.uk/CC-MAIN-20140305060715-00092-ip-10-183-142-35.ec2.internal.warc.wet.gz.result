Oscars 2013: Use these tricks to find out who will (possibly) win at the Oscars
Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin explains how to predict who will be the winners at this year's Oscars. The true soundtrack to the Oscars is the music of critics arguing Photo: GETTY	By Robbie Collin

Imagine there exists a group of film industry insiders who have correctly predicted the winners of the Best Picture Academy Award nine times in the past decade. Now imagine that this same shadowy cabal publishes its prediction very year, almost a month before Oscar night. Well, you don’t actually have to imagine this at all, because it’s true. With their Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures award, the Directors Guild of America has been quietly pre-ordaining the Best Picture Oscar since 1948 with uncanny accuracy. The DGA – a professional body made up of 14,500 film and television directors working in the US – has given its annual film prize to the eventual Best Picture winner 50 times in 63 years. What’s more, the same award has tallied with the Best Director Oscar 57 times, and is in the middle of an unbroken nine-year success streak. And now what if I was to tell you that in addition to this, there is a simple gimmick that can rule out at least half of the Best Picture nominees at a stroke, and which has only failed once since the earliest days of the Oscar ceremony? Again, this occult rubric actually exists: it is called the Best Director nominees list. Since 1933, the only film to have won the Academy’s top honour without also being mentioned in the directing category is Driving Miss Daisy. Otherwise, in almost eight decades of screenings, campaigns and secret ballots, the link has stayed unbroken. Related Articles

Before you take the deeds to your house to the nearest branch of Betfred, though, I should warn you that this year, these bellwethers are pointing in opposite directions, so whatever happens at tomorrow night’s ceremony, at least one of them will look a little less reliable in future. According to the nominations rule, Ben Affleck’s widely praised thriller Argo has no chance at Best Picture, because Affleck was not shortlisted in the Best Director category by the Academy’s 200-strong directors’ branch. On the strength of its DGA award, however, Argo’s Best Picture victory should be a certainty. But this is all part of the fun of the Oscar predictions racket, where money and reputations are staked – and lost – on forecasting the fickle tastes of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’s 5,783 members. Earlier this week, the film industry’s trade paper, The Hollywood Reporter, interviewed a director marking their ballot, allowing its readers an insight into the grapplings of the average Oscar voter. Michael Haneke’s Amour, a Palme d’Or winner at Cannes, was dismissed as “just a woman dying, and there’s no real story”. A Royal Affair, the Danish contender in the Best Foreign Language category, was passed over because “I fell asleep as I was watching it”. Life of Pi was also given short shrift: “Very well-directed and extremely well-thought-out, but I was put off by the religious message at the end,” said the director, who perhaps wisely elected to remain anonymous. Michael Haneke's Amour
Even for Academy members, second-guessing their colleagues is a slippery business. Listen on YouTube to the collective roar of disbelief that followed Jack Nicholson’s 2005 announcement that the Best Picture winner was not Ang Lee’s critically acclaimed gay cowboy romance Brokeback Mountain, but the Paul Haggis anti-racism drama Crash. Yet for those able to read the portents, Crash’s “surprise” victory was not so much of a surprise at all. Hollywood may like to think of itself as a liberal place, but it is not quite gay-cowboy-liberal just yet, and Tony Curtis and Ernest Borgnine, high-profile Academy members the pair, both publicly denounced Brokeback Mountain in the weeks leading up to the 2005 ceremony. (“If John Wayne were alive, he’d be rolling over in his grave,” Borgnine said.) A vote for Crash, with its less contentious message that racism isn’t very nice, allowed members to feel like they were still doing their bit. Consider this year’s contenders with that mindset, and the picture becomes clearer. Zero Dark Thirty, with its controversial depictions of present-day political strife in the Middle East, has generated less positive buzz than Argo, with its nostalgic depictions of Middle-Eastern political strife of yesteryear. Jessica Chastain in Zero Dark Thirty
It also goes some way to explain why Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino’s splashily violent anti-slavery Western, is languishing in the shadow of Steven Spielberg’s stately anti-slavery period drama Lincoln. Blood and guts has always been hard for the Academy to stomach: think back to the 1981 ceremony, when Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull was overshadowed by Robert Redford’s Ordinary People. Fast-forward 10 years and Scorsese’s Goodfellas was trumped by Kevin Costner’s Dances with Wolves. Emotional violence is fine so long as it is neatly resolved, but without a tidy ending you’re scuppered. Hence no Best Picture nomination this year for Paul Thomas Anderson’s troublingly open-ended melodrama The Master, or for other morally cloudy films in the past that are often ranked among the greatest ever made: Robert Altman’s Short Cuts, Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo, John Ford’s The Searchers, Carol Reed’s The Third Man. A final, crucial factor is the Academy’s ongoing efforts to make the Oscars more relevant to younger audiences. That was the rationale behind increasing the number of Best Picture nominees three years ago, and perhaps has steered their Best Picture choices over the past few years: The Artist, The King’s Speech, The Hurt Locker, Slumdog Millionaire and No Country for Old Men. A victory for Argo tomorrow night seems like a done deal. Is it the year’s best picture? Of course not. But is it a Best Picture? Almost inevitably. Follow Telegraph Film on Twitter

Moody's downgrade will stiffen George Osborne's resolve To understand Moody's late-night Friday downgrade of the UK economy it is helpful to go back to George Osborne's Autumn Statement of 2011 and a very useful analysis by the Centre for Policy Studies.
More significantly, Mr Osborne changed one of his fiscal rules into a "rolling target", allowing himself the luxury of hitting the Government's stated aim of eliminating the cyclically adjusted deficit two years later and well into the next Parliament. Moody's now expects that the UK's gross government debt level will peak at just over 96pc of GDP in 2016. Photo: PAUL GROVER	By Kamal Ahmed, Sunday Telegraph Business Editor

At a time of ballooning debt, the Government still found – one assumes down the back of the fiscal sofa – a few pages of policy initiatives with prices attached. There was a £50 cut in water bills for families in the south-west of England, a £250m fund to support "energy-intensive firms", a £1bn "youth contract" to subsidise work placements, a regional growth development fund totalling £1bn, a restriction on rail fare increases and £50m to safeguard cross-border sleeper train services (and, no, I didn't make that last one up).
"The harder the times, the greater the temptation for any Chancellor to indulge in initiativitis," said Tim Knox, director of the CPS.
"A few hundred million quid can be thrown at a particular region or demographic group and the headlines can be dissipated. Even with another £145bn of debt being incurred over the lifetime of this Parliament, the Chancellor still felt he should spend your money."
More significantly, Mr Osborne changed one of his fiscal rules into a "rolling target", allowing himself the luxury of hitting the Government's stated aim of eliminating the cyclically adjusted deficit two years later and well into the next Parliament. Moody's now expects that the UK's gross government debt level will peak at just over 96pc of GDP in 2016.
This 2011 tinkering sowed the seeds for Moody's move this weekend. When the economic headwinds turned sour through 2012, the "automatic stabilisers" such as increasing welfare benefits, kicked in, resulting in a loosening of fiscal conditions.

Mr Cameron, this is no way to treat business
06 Oct 2012
Add to that the travails of the eurozone, itself built from an alliance of states with unsustainably high levels of spending, and the UK's path to eliminating the deficit suddenly looked a lot steeper.
Mr Osborne rightly accused Labour of not fixing the roof while the sun was shining only to subsequently find that it was even harder to fix the roof when it was bucketing down with rain.
As the economist Mark Littlewood pithily stated on Friday evening: "If you pretend you are reducing the deficit, but are actually on a £600bn Keynesian deficit-financed stimulus, then expect to be downgraded."
Mr Osborne, of course, knows all this and far from damaging the Chancellor, oddly this downgrade is just what he needs. When the next Government minister approaches him ahead of next month's Budget with a scheme for a "little bit of help" for some policy or other, the Chancellor can wave Moody's latest opinions directly in his or her face.
Unlike his shadow, Ed Balls, the Chancellor has been given a new weapon against those who think that the way to cut the deficit is to initially add to it.
State spending still takes up far too great a proportion of GDP in Britain, particularly outside the economically more vibrant London and south-east of England.
The tax burden on both individuals and businesses is too high and overly complicated, depressing output and entrepreneurial flair. Since the last election, this Government has introduced, or is planning to introduce, 299 separate tax rises. We are still a nation that loves to fiddle at the edges rather than take the necessary strategic steps to fundamentally reduce the size of the state.
There are good reasons for hope. Mr Osborne's response to the downgrade ("Far from weakening our resolve to deliver our economic recovery plan, this decision redoubles it") was the right one. As Moody's said in its downgrade report: "The stable outlook on the UK's Aa1 sovereign rating partly reflects the strengths that underpin the Aa1 rating itself – the underlying economic strength and fiscal policy commitment, which Moody's expects will ultimately allow the UK government to reverse the debt trajectory."
The ratings agency said, and you will not read this in the critics' gleeful response to the downgrade, that the "UK's creditworthiness remains extremely high". It described the UK economy as highly competitive and diversified, helped by very long maturity cycles on its debt. Not being in the eurozone is an unmitigated blessing as sterling remains under the Bank of England's control and is a global reserve currency.
When France was downgraded, unlike the UK, it was maintained on negative watch, as was America. The UK is now "stable" in outlook. Even in France, with far greater economic problems, 10-year bond yields did jump temporarily, before settling back. The Chancellor has no need to panic.
What Mr Osborne does need to do is make the case more strongly than ever that the deficit must be cut and, ultimately, the UK's debt mountain tackled. That is how you regain triple A ratings.
In 2011, the Chancellor will possibly admit to himself now that he wavered with all the shouting around him that he "must do more" – always shorthand for higher spending. When the siren voices come next time, Mr Osborne should politely tell them where to go.
Centrica's doing good
"All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?" You must wonder whether the famous sketch from Monty Python's Life of Brian was on Sam Laidlaw's mind when he agreed for the first time to produce a "wider economic impact" report on the value of Centrica to the UK.
The report, released this weekend, reveals that Centrica, of which Mr Laidlaw is CEO, supports 174,000 jobs in the UK, generated £4.2bn in taxes and has a supply chain made up of 6,000 UK business.
The report should be required reading for every politician, think tank, pressure group and anti-business campaigner polishing up their outrage meter ready for this week's announcement that Centrica, which operates British Gas, has increased profits.
"Bills are going up," the critics will shout, "To line the pockets of management and shareholders. It's a disgrace."
Such criticisms are wrong. Yes, profits are up (which is good for our pension funds) but that is because British Gas sold 12pc more gas in 2012 than 2011, a milder year. Margins, the amount that Centrica makes from each unit of gas, are down. As a proportion of the household bill, just 5pc is paid to Centrica in profit, a far lower figure than that paid for green levies.
For the whole group, nearly all of the profit increase actually comes from smart investment decisions made in Norway and America, where acquisitions are starting to produce results.
For any other business this would be seen as a matter for congratulation, not opprobrium. Kamal Ahmed

The Prime Minister should have stood firm in the face of Tory revolt
David Cameron is showing true leadership in his pledge to give voters a say on the EU, but his retreat over the Immigration Bill was not his finest hour

Comments
In politics, authority – not just transient power, but true authority – is hard to acquire and easy to lose. The deeper meaning of auctoritas fascinated Cicero and the medieval scholastics alike. In the modern era, authority is a rare phenomenon indeed: a compound of menace, empathy, plausibility and mystique.
When David Cameron addresses his plans for a referendum on EU membership, he does so with a confidence that increasingly commands respect and attention. Last week, the Lords scuppered James Wharton’s private member’s Bill to ensure that the question is put to the British people before the end of 2017. No matter, replied the Prime Minister. He is, he said, prepared to invoke the Parliament Act to force the Bill on to the statute books, a constitutionally eccentric but politically audacious means of keeping the issue in the headlines. The lead of Europe is starting to glitter.
In other respects, however, the week was a patchwork of confusion and ignominy. On Thursday, the PM was saved from a serious defeat in the Commons only by Labour and Lib Dem votes. The Cameroons are furious with the Speaker, John Bercow, for (in their view) defying all parliamentary precedent and the guidance of Erskine May to call a vote on Dominic Raab’s amendment to the Immigration Bill.
The Tory MP for Esher and Walton proposed that the deportation of foreign criminals should be mandatory, except in the most extraordinary circumstances – a radical curtailment of judicial discretion, intended to stop the abuse of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (which protects family life) to thwart expulsions from these shores. Though sympathetic to the spirit in which Raab had drafted his amendment, Cameron was advised that this would breach the UK’s obligations as a signatory of the ECHR. But – to avoid a confrontation – the PM instructed ministers to abstain and gambled that Labour and the Lib Dems would vote the amendment down.
This was an inglorious moment in Cameron’s political history. His first intervention at PMQs, a little more than eight years ago, was of a very different fibre. Squaring up to Tony Blair, who faced bitter internal opposition to his plans for schools, the newly elected Tory leader cheekily offered his own party’s support to get his New Labour role model out of a hole. “The first issue that the Prime Minister and I are going to have to work together on,” Cameron said, “is getting the good bits of his education reforms through the House of Commons and into law.” That was in December 2005. In early 2014, it is Cameron who is depending on Opposition votes to avoid a clash with his own MPs, 85 of whom supported the Raab amendment. On Thursday, I was reminded of Bill Clinton’s remark that, as the years pass, all politicians suffer “cellular” damage. The most senior Tories in the land looked shrunken, supplicant and just a little bit desperate.

Lift the tax burden and reap the electoral reward
01 Feb 2014
What, for instance, was Theresa May up to when she suddenly proposed powers to strip foreign-born terror suspects of British citizenship? I have been generally supportive of the counter-terrorist measures proposed since 9/11 by Labour and Tory home secretaries alike: it is folly to pretend, as so many do, that a new conflict can be fought with old tools. That said, such measures should never be taken lightly. What Mrs May proposed last week has been eclipsed by the Raab amendment and its aftermath. But it is a significant step, and one that deserves detailed reflection. If passed into law, it will certainly leave some individuals stateless and, as a consequence, conspicuously vulnerable to ill-treatment and torture.
I am told, somewhat elliptically, that her 11th-hour amendment reflected fresh information about the number of terrorist suspects in this country and their possible purpose. Very well: let this contingency be discussed, as far as national security allows. Instead, the measure was swallowed by the petty politics of rebellion and barely scrutinised. This is not statesmanship.
Inadvertently, the Immigration Bill, which will now proceed to the Upper House, has become a political parable of the electoral struggle ahead. It embodies both Cameron’s desire to trump the UK Independence Party and – strategically – his insistence that he would go much further, were he at the helm of a purely Conservative government rather than a bipartisan Coalition.
It is true that, with a decent Tory majority, the PM would probably have taken tougher measures on immigration, sooner in the Parliament. Welfare reform, the Human Rights Act, taxation, free schools: in all these areas of policy and others it is at least plausible that a fully-Conservative government would have acted differently, and more radically.
Yet there is deep peril embedded in this narrative. First, it risks restoring the entirely discredited notion that the reason the Conservatives fell short in 2010 is that they were not sufficiently Right-wing: a proposition for which there is precisely zero evidence. Second, the relentless portrayal of Clegg as a contaminant in the Tory pool creates a potential crisis of expectation. Often, when Conservatives say “…if only the Lib Dems weren’t so fussy” what they really mean is “if only our international treaty obligations were different” or “if only we didn’t have to live in the reality-based community”.
It is not, for instance, Nick Clegg’s fault that Article 8 of the ECHR says what it does about family life or that Britain signed the convention (having drafted it) 64 years ago. Yes, a Tory-only government might indeed tear up that commitment or at least suspend it. But let us not pretend that such an act would be straightforward politically or constitutionally, requiring only the absence of the Lib Dems from the Cabinet table.
The same logic applies to welfare reform. Its progress has often been framed as a battle between tough Tories and lily-livered Lib Dems. But – again – the reality is much more subtle. Often, the very Conservatives who argue most vociferously for welfare cuts as a generality are the most plaintive about their surgeries, full of constituents complaining about the “bedroom tax” or relatives in wheelchairs mysteriously judged fit to work by Atos. These human dilemmas were not invented by the Lib Dems and will not evaporate if, as is now at least conceivable, the Conservatives win the next election outright.
The great achievement of Cameron’s predecessor as Tory leader, Michael Howard, was to restore the order that had been conspicuously lacking in the party’s ranks since the early Nineties. Last week, he made a rare intervention to remind his colleagues that “what is needed in this stage of the parliament is a degree of self-discipline by Conservative backbenchers”. In other words, unite or die.
Lord Howard is right. But unity is more than self-discipline; it is a collective response to authority. Cameron’s horizons are brightening, but he was wrong last week to avoid confrontation with his backbenchers. Too often, Tory dissenters and their sympathisers brandish the claims of conscience like Cambridge spies. It is not the primary function of a prime minister to make MPs feel good. A functioning democracy needs those who will speak truth to power. But it also needs leaders brave enough to speak truth to dissent.

The Pope
Pope Benedict XVI prays in Arabic for the first time The Pope delivered a greeting in Arabic for the first time during his weekly general audience on Wednesday as part of an effort to reach out to Muslims as well as Arabic-speaking Christians in the Middle East. A Vatican statement said the Pope wanted to continue the spirit of his trip to Lebanon last month Photo: Mohamed Azakir/REUTERS	By Nick Squires, Rome
4:17PM BST 10 Oct 2012
Benedict XVI typically delivers greetings in six languages, including English and Italian, but added a message in Arabic as he addressed the crowds in St Peter's Square.
"The pope prays for all people who speak Arabic. May God bless you all," the Pontiff said.
An Arabic-speaking priest read out a fuller summary of the Pope's address, which dwelt on the 50th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council, which reformed key aspects of the Roman Catholic Church in the 1960s.
The Vatican said it was adding Arabic to the six other languages, including Italian, English, French and Benedict's native German, typically spoken during the general audience.
The initiative reflects the Church's concern that Christians are being persecuted in the region and that their numbers are dwindling.

14 Sep 2012
A century ago Christians made up about 20 per cent of the population of the Middle East, but that figure has now dropped to around five per cent, as war and civil unrest force many to emigrate. The population is estimated to be around 15 million.
The Vatican said it hoped the Pope's adoption of Arabic would be a comfort to Arabic-speaking Christians in the Middle East and could ease tensions with Muslims.
Benedict's papacy was plunged into crisis in 2006, just a year after he was elected, when he gave a speech at the University of Regensburg in Germany, in which he quoted a highly critical remark about Islam made by a 14th century Byzantine emperor.
It referred to the teachings of Mohammed as "evil and human" and alluded to his "command to spread by the sword the faith he preached."
The Vatican insisted that the quote was taken out of context and that Benedict was misunderstood, but the speech led to violent protests in some Islamic countries.
The Pope, 85, is keen to further a spirit of reconciliation between Christians and Muslims following his trip to Lebanon last month, where he appealed for people of both religions to help to end the conflict in neighbouring Syria.
"The Holy Father intends to express his perpetual concern and support for Christians in the Middle East, and to remind everyone of their duty to pray and work for peace in the region," the Vatican said in a statement. The Pope

Cuttings from cut flowers
Sprigs eternal: roses are easy to propagate Elspeth Thompson
12:01AM BST 30 Aug 2006
Comments
The idea of taking cuttings raises terror even in experienced gardeners, writes Elspeth Thompson
In my mother-in-law's lovely garden in Bristol there is a corkscrew willow tree, about five feet tall and wide. Its twisted branches are covered in pussy-willow puffs in spring and form a striking, sculptural silhouette in winter. A similar sized tree would cost at least £40 in the shops, but my mother-in-law got hers for free by, several years ago, taking a large sprig of Salix babylonica 'Tortuosa' which had formed part of a church flower arrangement and sticking it in some moist soil. This got me thinking about the possibility of creating plants from cut flowers. Though few plants "take" as easily as willow, many other flowering shrubs or foliage plants which are commonly found in flower arrangements can be propagated fairly easily from cuttings. Not long ago, it was common for gardeners to propagate their own plants by growing from seed, or from stem, root or leaf cuttings. But the recent spate of garden makeover programmes on television has led the new generation of gardeners to believe that plants are to be bought in fully-grown from garden centres rather than lovingly raised themselves. The very idea of taking cuttings raises terror in even quite experienced gardeners: I'm ashamed to say that I myself have seldom strayed beyond the most foolproof candidates such as pelargoniums and brugmansia, which I simply stick in a jar of water on a sunny windowsill and wait for the roots to form. It was to encourage and revive gardeners' interest in propagation that John Cushnie - a landscape gardener best-known as a regular panellist on BBC Radio 4's Gardener's Question Time - wrote his most recent book, How to Propagate: Techniques and Tips for Over 1000 Plants (Kyle Cathie £19·99 - see below). Cushnie has been growing plants from cuttings for more than 40 years; while still a schoolboy, he raised a bit of extra pocket money by rooting hundreds of chrysanthemum cuttings and growing them on into plants, and it was to him I turned for advice on creating plants from bouquets. "It's a great way of saving money and letting that gift or floral tribute live on," he says. "Obviously fresh material is desirable but if the stems are in water and the foliage is fresh, with no signs of wilting, then there is every chance of success." At this time of year the things most likely to take are semi-ripe cuttings of conifers and lavender; but by October, he says, hardwood cuttings of hydrangea, philadelphus, weigelia and roses can be rooted out in the garden border. Hebe, hypericum and skimmia, greenery that is commonly found in cut flower bunches, are other good candidates. There are three types of stem cuttings - softwood (young, sappy growth from lilac, lavender and fleshy-stemmed plants such as busy lizzies and begonias); semi-ripe (springy shoots that bend but do not snap, which can be taken from July to October); and hardwood cuttings that are the twiggy sticks of this year's growth and best taken after leaf-fall in October or November. Each type requires special treatment, so exact instructions are impossible to give here, but it's always crucial to water the plant well a day or two beforehand, to use a very sharp knife or razor blade in order to reduce damage to the stem, and to make sure that hands, tools and work surfaces are scrupulously clean, as many cuttings fail due to rot or disease that sets in to the wound. For more detailed instructions, buy Cushnie's book or order an excellent DVD on the topic made by another of the real experts - Derry Watkins of Special Plants Nursery in Wiltshire. If, like my mother-in-law's willow, the stems in your bouquet have already sprouted roots in the vase, Cushnie advises taking advantage of this and letting them continue. "The trick is to transfer the water-loving rooted plant to compost," he says. "Remove the stems you don't need and gradually add soil to the water until it becomes wet compost. At that stage pot the cuttings, weaning them off the waterlogged conditions as you go." Creating plants from cuttings is a lovely way of making something lasting from a particularly special bouquet - one given for a silver or golden wedding anniversary, perhaps, or even flowers from a funeral. The most obvious example, of course, is a bride's bouquet, which might contain roses, jasmine, honeysuckle, mimosa or frothy white philadelphus (commonly known as 'bride's blossom'), all of which are relatively easy to raise from cuttings. Myrtle is another bride's favourite which can be propagated with ease; in fact many of the mature myrtle trees in large, public and private gardens in the UK are descended from cuttings that were taken from the sprigs of myrtle in Queen Victoria's wedding bouquet more than 150 years ago. How to Propagate by John Cushnie (Kyle Cathie) is published on September 21. To order for £17·99 + £1·25 p&p, please call Telegraph Books on 0870 428 4115.

Australian Open 2012: Novak Djokovic throws shirt to girl in crowd, sees it snatched by different woman
Competition was fierce in Melbourne on Sunday, with participants slugging it out for a gruelling six hours in order to take home the coveted prize on offer. By Telegraph staff

Comments
We're talking, of course, about the battle for position for the main event at the Australian Open final, and the epic contest for Novak Djokovic's sweat-stained shirt.
Following the Serb's epic win over Rafael Nadal he headed for the crowd and appeared to be aiming for a specific fan when he chucked his t-shirt.
Instead an entirely different lady swept in to steal the glory and a tasteful white number, which she then held up to inspect as if it was a blouse in H&M that she isn't quite sure about.
It's the acceptable face of opportunism.
