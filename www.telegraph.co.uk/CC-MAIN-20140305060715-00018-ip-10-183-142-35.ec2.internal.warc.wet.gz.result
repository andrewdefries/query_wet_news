Clove oil - The ten best homemade remedies
To treat: Toothache
Clove oil is a brilliant source of eugenol, a natural pain killer and antibacterial and is a popular toothache cure in folk medicine. Usually it is administered by mixing a few drops with 1/4 teaspoon of olive oil, applying cotton wool soaked in the mixture to the painful area. However individuals using clove oil should note the risks involved. Undiluted clove oil in contact with the mouth can cause burning, tissue or nerve damage and pain, with large doses potentially leading to vomiting, sore throat, seizure, difficulty breathing, kidney failure, or liver damage. Clove oil should not be applied to broken skin.
Disclaimer: always consult your doctor for advice before taking medicinal homemade remedies.

MPs' expenses: Jo Swinson submitted receipts for tooth flosser and eyeliner
Jo Swinson, the youngest MP in the House of Commons, included receipts for eyeliner, a “tooth flosser” and 29p dusters with her parliamentary expenses claims. Jo Swinsonss records show that she submitted receipts for items ranging in price from 29p to £544.90 By Rosa Prince
8:45AM BST 21 May 2009
Miss Swinson, a Liberal Democrat who was 25 when she was elected MP for Dunbartonshire East in 2005, denied claiming for cosmetics but defended the use of taxpayer-funded expenses to pay for dozens of other everyday items. At one point, she submitted a Tesco receipt for £22.67 that appeared to show that the MP or an aide went to the trouble of putting an asterisk next to three items, totalling £5.75, for which she intended to claim — a £1.75 chopping board, a “food saver” for £1.50 and a £2.50 sieve. An Asda receipt included a bottle of Mr Sheen cleaner costing 78p and a £1.19 window cleaner. She also claimed for a hair dryer and £16 lavatory roll holder, along with a £14.10 invoice to have a spare key cut for her cleaner. Public concern over MPs’ expenses has focused on the petty nature of some of the claims submitted on second home allowances, as well as the more extravagant spending of taxpayers’ money. Miss Swinson’s records show that she submitted receipts for items ranging in price from a packet of dusters for 29p to a television costing £544.90. Related Articles

MPs' expenses: So what is a duck house?
21 May 2009
Known in Westminster for the attention she pays to her appearance, Miss Swinson’s receipts contain a number of items relating to her personal care. They included a “tooth flosser” costing £19.10, which the Commons fees office rejected, along with a set of “toothbrush refills”. A few months previously, however, and in an apparent breach of the rules that prevented claims for personal items, she was reimbursed for an electric toothbrush and hairdryer. Also among her receipts was a £27.94 bill from Boots, which included a £5 eyeliner, a lip liner for the same price, and a £12.00 “R&M Eye Kit”. Contacted by the Telegraph, Miss Swinson said she had not claimed for the eyeliner, suggesting that it featured on a receipt that included other items for which she did seek repayment. No items other than cosmetics appeared on the receipt in question — it seemed to be the second of two pages, the first of which is missing. Asked why she had regularly used the additional costs allowance, which MPs may used to fund a second home, to claim for low-cost, everyday items, Miss Swinson said: “None of these items would have been necessary for me to buy were I not living away from home for half of the week. “Most of these were approved and the costs reimbursed, a couple were not and I accepted this. “As a new MP, my understanding was that the ACA reimbursed the costs of setting up a place to stay in London, including duplicates of the various kitchen and bathroom items that I use in my main home. “The receipt for the Mr Sheen and dusters was with the invoices from my cleaner submitted on Oct 13 2005. However, I directly reimbursed my cleaner for these items and did not claim for them. “I am at work when she cleans my flat, so it was necessary to provide her with a key in order to get in. A television is necessary in order to follow programming relevant to my job.”
Miss Swinson said she claimed less than the maximum food allowance of £400 a month — usually about £10 for each day she attended Parliament. Jo Swinson Job: backbench Lib Dem MP Salary: £64,766 Total second home claims 2004-05: £0 2005-06: £18,383 2006-07: £18,590 2007-08: £23,083 MPs' expenses

Rural Chinese banker built up £100 million property portfolio
A rural Chinese banker has been accused of using multiple identities to build up a property empire worth £100 million, in the latest case of the Communist party cracking down on corruption. Reports suggest Gong Aiai purchased flats in Beijing's eastern Chaoyang District Photo: ALAMY	By Carolynne Wheeler, Beijing
12:07PM GMT 24 Jan 2013
Gong Aiai, 49, who is known in the Chinese blogosphere as "Older House Sister", is said to have parlayed her position as deputy head of a small bank in northwestern China's Shaanxi province into at least three extra identities, one of them identifying her as a Beijing native that allowed her to buy up sought-after property holdings in the capital. Reports suggest she purchased flats in Beijing's eastern Chaoyang District, as well as in her native province, which is home to the Terracotta Warriors. Property ownership is an issue in China where fast-rising housing prices have put home ownership out of the reach of much of the middle class. By law only those with hard to obtain Beijing residency permits are allowed to buy property in the capital, and they are now restricted to just two. China's Ministry of Public Security on Thursday promised a thorough investigation with severe punishment. They have not said, however, they will investigate how she managed to accumulate such wealth while working for a county bank. Her properties have been seized, according to reports.

Three police officers, including the deputy head of the public security bureau of Shenmu County in Shaanxi, have been suspended, state media reported. Forging identity documents, a practice also commonly used to hide income, carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Xi Jinping, China's incoming president, earlier this week pledged to bring the rule of law down hard on both "tigers and flies" and the case of Mrs Gong and her apartments is the latest of several high-profile corruption cases exposed by online whistleblowers and put under official investigation. Along with "Older House Sister", there is also a "Younger House Sister" – a young woman in Henan province whose well-connected family acquired 31 properties using multiple identities – and an "Uncle House", a Guangdong housing official sacked last year after being found to own 22 properties. Other high-ranking officials are said to be selling off properties for fear of being caught. China
