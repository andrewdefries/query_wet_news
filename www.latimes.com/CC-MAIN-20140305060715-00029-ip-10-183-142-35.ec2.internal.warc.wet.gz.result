Kurt Andersen stays a step ahead of history with 'True Believers' The Occupy Wall Street movement's arrival is well timed for his new novel about a law school dean who intends to reveal her radical 1960s past. By Carolyn Kellogg, Los Angeles Times
July 8, 2012

The public intellectual has become a rare creature in America, but Kurt Andersen has helped keep it from going extinct. He co-founded Spy magazine, was editor of New York magazine and now writes pieces like Time's 2011 person of the year story, the Protester. These days, though, he mostly splits his time between hosting "Studio 360," broadcast weekly to 160 NPR stations, and writing the occasional bestselling novel. His next book, "True Believers" (Random House: 447 pp., $27), comes out Tuesday.The novel is about Karen Hollander, a law school dean and former Supreme Court nominee, who sets out to write an autobiography that will reveal her most deeply held secret, a radical 1960s past. Describing Hollander, Andersen jokes that she's like Hillary Clinton, "if Hillary never met Bill and became a lawyer … and had this secret in her life that presumably Hillary does not."In alternating chapters, the book works its way into that secret from two directions. First, there is Hollander's Midwestern childhood, in which she and her two closest friends play elaborate James Bond games based on Ian Fleming's books. Her granddaughter Waverly gleefully tells her that she invented LARPing before explaining that LARP is an acronym for live-action role playing. That's from the other thread, based in the present-ish 2013. As the secretly radical Hollander unpacks the narrative of her past, her adored teenage granddaughter is openly involved in public protests."I finished a draft before Occupy Wall Street existed," Andersen says. "I basically finished the book, and suddenly, holy cow! There's this thing called Occupy." That meant, on the one hand, some rapid revising — Waverly's radicalism took on a name and shape — and on the other, that Andersen had been one step ahead."I felt, dare I say, prescient?" he says. It is, indeed, all but predictive. Andersen is uniquely positioned to write so-close-it-comes-true fiction, drawing on his particular experiences analyzing the political and artistic world around him. "The journalist in me, when he is a fiction writer, gets to be a dowser," he explains.The lanky Andersen has a self-effacing humility; perhaps it's his Nebraska upbringing. He is quick to make sure that what he says doesn't come across as pretentious, and he's a lively, engaged presence on Twitter. Look closely, though, and his quietly elegant suit jacket and

Afghan protesters chant slogans against Pakistan during a demonstration on the outskirts of Kabul.
(Rahmat Gul / Associated Press / May 6, 2013)
By Hashmat Baktash and Alexandra Zavis
May 6, 2013, 2:33 p.m.
KABUL, Afghanistan — The Afghan government summoned Pakistan’s charge d’affaires in Kabul to the Foreign Ministry on Monday to file a “strong protest” after another clash along the countries' troubled border.
The skirmish, which broke out in the morning and lasted a couple of hours, underscored the deteriorating relations between the two countries at a time when U.S. officials are pressing them to step up efforts to reach a settlement with Taliban militants.
A statement issued Monday by the Afghan Foreign Ministry accused Pakistan of an “unprovoked attack” Monday against its troops in the Goshta district of Nangarhar province that involved both heavy and light weapons.
No Afghan casualties were reported in the firefight, which occurred in the same area where a clash last week killed an Afghan border policeman and wounded troops on both sides.
A spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry, Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, told the Associated Press that a Pakistani military post near the border came under fire from Afghanistan on Monday morning, injuring one of the Pakistani troops.
“That post has been under attack for some time now,” he was quoted as saying, but added it was unclear who had opened fire Monday.
The area has been a source of friction between the two countries. Each side has accused the other of cross-border shelling that has killed civilians and of giving sanctuary to Islamic militants who target their respective forces.
Last month, Afghan President Hamid Karzai accused Pakistan of building a border gate on Afghan territory, charges disputed by Pakistani officials, who said the gate was being constructed on their side of the border. “In the case of Pakistani forces’ continued refusal to remove all Pakistani installations in Goshta and other areas and any further unprovoked attacks by Pakistani forces, Pakistan will bear responsibility for any consequences,” the Afghan Foreign Ministry said in its statement.
Hundreds of Afghans demonstrated on the outskirts of Kabul, the capital, on Monday, chanting anti-Pakistan slogans, according to news reports.
Despite the fractious relationship, Pakistan is seen as a key player in international efforts to broker a peace deal between the Afghan government and Taliban insurgents in that country before most foreign troops withdraw next year.
Pakistan has longstanding ties with Afghan Taliban leaders dating back to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Many experts believe Pakistan continues to support insurgents fighting in Afghanistan. However, the government in Islamabad is concerned that if civil war breaks out in Afghanistan, it could embolden Pakistan's insurgency.

Flacco shows he's elite QB
11 touchdowns, no interceptions in playoffs, plus Super Bowl MVP should earn him respect
David Haugh
In the Wake of the News

NEW ORLEANS — Midway through the third quarter of Sunday night's Super Bowl XLVII, a Superdome spokesman issued a statement to explain what happened during the surreal 34-minute delay when the lights went out.
"Power has been restored,'' Eric Eagan said. "We sincerely apologize for the incident.''
Forgive Ravens coach John Harbaugh and the city of Baltimore if they bristled at the apology. How does one say I'm sorry for almost costing you the Super Bowl anyway?
As NFL and local officials got to the bottom of the embarrassment, the Ravens' commanding 28-6 lead quickly became a one-possession toss-up when the 49ers scored two touchdowns in 2 minutes, 21 seconds after the outage. Indeed, electricity returned to the building in every way and suspense suddenly filled the air again in a 34-31 victory for the Ravens that was not decided until the final tick.
All the while, Joe Flacco shrugged.
"Hey, those things happen,'' the Super Bowl most valuable player said of the bizarre circumstances. "We just had to go out and do our job.''
Ho and hum. Flacco had waited five years to establish himself as an elite NFL quarterback. No snafu at the Superdome delaying the inevitable another half-hour was going to unnerve the coolest Joe since Montana. No fourth-quarter drama was going to faze the unflappable quarterback who showed his most emotion of Super Bowl week celebrating as confetti fell around him.
"Crazy. Unbelievable. It's tough to put into words,'' Flacco said.
Go ahead and believe that Ray Lewis w

A pint and a play in London pubs
There are few bad seats in the London's intimate pub theaters, where the acting and action are heightened by close proximity. And who knows? The next breakout star could be a creaky-floored soliloquy away.
By John Lee
March 17, 2013

LONDON — It's Saturday afternoon in the jam-packed Old Red Lion on London's shopper-crowded St. John Street. Beer-fueled chatter — including some salty heckles — ricochets off the TV screens, while the pub's lone server pours pints of frothy ale in double-quick time. Local soccer team Arsenal is playing, and the game isn't going well.
Nestled among the red-shirted lager lovers are several quiet imbibers, their tables topped with glasses of wine and the occasional well-thumbed paperback. They don't seem to know there's a game on. The reason? This is a pub with two sets of regulars, and the second group is waiting patiently for the matinee performance of "The Revenger's Tragedy" upstairs in the tiny theater.
London is crammed with old-school pubs, several dozen of which are also part of a lesser-known theatrical tradition. Since Shakespeare's time, greasepaint-loving taverns across the city have adapted their spare rooms to host performances for patrons who like to catch a show or two without moving too far from their favorite bar taps.
A permanent fringe movement, this eclectic pub-theater scene thrives, with Londoners and savvy visitors regularly squeezing into 50-seat studios for dramas, comedies, musicals and even operas. And although tickets rarely top $25, quality isn't sacrificed: Kate Winslet and Alan Rickman cut their acting teeth in local pub theaters, so the next breakout star could be just a creaky-floored soliloquy away.
Today, squinting at photos of shows past on the Old Red Lion's walls, I don't spot any Winslets or Rickmans among the stills from "Diary of a Madman" and "The Importance of Being Earnest." But because it's almost 3 p.m., it's time to join the line climbing the carpeted stairs to the theater. Shuffling in, I slide onto a bench in front of the stageless performance area.
Two feet away, a spotlighted actor, studiously ignoring the audience, is doing push-ups. It's like being a fly on the wall while someone goes about his daily business. The raucous pub downstairs is soon forgotten as the doors quietly close and the enveloping silence creates nervous expectation.
There's just time to read the program and discover this actor's extensive résumé of movies, TV shows and stage produc
