A fresh take on the frittata: Master Class
In this pretty frittata, slow-cooked eggs make a soft-thin base for toppings.
By Nancy Silverton and Carolynn Carreño
September 8, 2012
Advertisement
It started out an ordinary enough morning. I was on vacation in London with Ruth Reichl and two other girlfriends, and naturally we'd planned our day around where we wanted to eat. For breakfast, we went to the Toe Path Cafe, an adorable little place I'd read about, and I did what I always do when I go out for breakfast: I scanned the menu for eggs. When I saw a frittata, I ordered it, having no idea that it was going to be nothing short of life-altering. Life-altering in terms of my egg-making and egg-eating life, anyway.I love eggs. With the exception of eggs that have been boiled so long they have a gray rim around the yolk and the terrible, recently popular, slimy 90-degree egg, which I hope never to have to see again, I love eggs almost any way they're cooked. I love properly hard-cooked eggs. I love fried eggs. I love poached eggs and soft scrambled eggs. And I love the French tradition of an omelet and salad for dinner.<

Walking 10,000 steps in a day requires some planning to reach your goal. Most don't reach 10,000 steps without adding in some moderate exercise.

From: To: Roaming the open spaces of Santa Barbara A rancho from Mexican land grant days. A coastal bluff. A butterfly preserve. The Land Trust for Santa Barbara County ensures they remain wild and welcoming.
CAPTIONS The 782-acre Arroyo Hondo Preserve sits beneath the Santa Ynez Mountains west of Santa Barbara between Refugio State Beach and Gaviota State Park. The open land of the former rancho is preserved through its purchase by the Land Trust for Santa Barbara County. (Susan Spano / For The Times)
