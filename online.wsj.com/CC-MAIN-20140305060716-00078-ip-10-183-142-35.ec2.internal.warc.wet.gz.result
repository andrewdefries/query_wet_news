Do we need religion to have ethics? Is it possible that a world without religion can be, on the whole, a better place to live?

I am through about half of Lawrence Krauss' A Universe from Nothing. It is a fascinating compendium of the current thought on the nature of the Universe. Krauss paints a picture of science progressing from flawed models of the Universe to what is currently known about it. He starts with Einsteins Theories of General and Specific Relativity. He quickly gets into a discussion of quantum mechanics and it influence on the field of cosmology. Based on these theories and observations scientists had begun to think that the Universe was a curved structure. However the expansion of the universe at an observed constant but probably increasing rate could not be explained by such a model. For one thing, there was not enough mass (including dark matter) to explain the observations of movement of observed galaxies. So he and others proposed that the actual universe was a 3 dimensional flat structure and the expansion was caused by heretofore unknown source of energy that made up 70% of the universe. This energy has come be known as dark energy and according to Krauss is responsible for the expansion of the universe at an observed constant rate. This energy acts as a cosmological constant much like the one Einstein used to keep his perception of the universe from expanding. Einstien knew that his equations suggested that the universe was expanding but current opinion was that it wasn't . Einstein called using the constant his greatest mistake. This is heady stuff and I as I have said before I barely understand what Krauss is describing. But I find it exhilerating that so many smart people are racking their brains trying to figure this stuff out. And it is also why I find it so maddening that there is a school of thought that thinks that this all just a waste of time. As scientist figure out more and more, this school simply observes that "all they'll find is that we were right all along" "God created the heavens and the Earth". So what notions of heavens did ancient man envision when he wrote that?
Our knowledge of the "heavens" has smshed the anthropic principle. Though a set of laws holds this universe together that happens to also allow our kind of life to exist, by in large this Universe is unrelentingly hostile to our type of life. And now there is no guarantee that this is the only universe to exist. There is some evidence that a universe results everytime a star implodes. And even if there was some sort of first cause agent, The distance between what was done and where we are in our thought process about what was done, renders worrying about such an agent a moot point. There is simply much more to know before we need to worry about a creator. With the maginitude of distances and masses involved, it would seem foolish to think that deity capable of creating all of this , then sets about writing letters to chosen subjects and arbitrarily suspends the laws governing how his creation operates. Indeed, we are just scratching the service of how these laws behave. We are simply not qualified to say that they have been suspended at all. Unexplained phenomena may be routine quantum events which suggest that there was no such intervention. Then again, as many of these phenomena are, they could be hallucinations , mass hyteria, or even more common natural events that were unknown to the observers or taken out of context. I still haven't gotten to part where Krauss proposes a universe out of nothing. But he is setting the stage for predictable quantum events as the causal agent.

"As scientist figure out more and more, this school simply observes that 'all they'll find is that we were right all along, God created the heavens and the Earth.' So what notions of heavens did ancient man envision when he wrote that?"Let's compare quotes: Krauss: "And the universe, in the far future, will be cold and dark and empty. So in fact as my late friend Christopher Hitchens, who was writing the forward for the book before he passed away, used to say: Nothing is heading towards us as fast as it can. So another answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is just wait."Genesis 1:1, "Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters." Krauss: "But if gravity is there, it can actually create stuff where there was none before. And you can actually create enough stuff to account for everything we see in the universe."Hebrews 11:3, "By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible." Krauss: "And while it's a little pretentious, I'll be pretentious anyway, the idea, I think, is similar, if you think about it, to the origin of life, Darwin's demonstration that life, which appears to be designed here on Earth, the diversity of life can actually arise, that diversity can arise by natural causes."And we don't yet know the true origin of life, but we think we'll understand it by chemistry, and what we're discovering is that in fact physics has suggested that maybe the same is true for the whole universe, that we don't need a creator." Me: So his goal is to find a way to explain the universe and its existence without a creator and has found pretty much what the Bible says, and although it's a "little pretentious" and "we don't yet know the true origin of life," "but we think" that physics has "suggested" that "maybe" we don't need a creator. Wow, he sounds pretty sure of himself there.Greg, if you want to support this guy, his ideas and work, buy his books and give to his cause. That's what I do with the things I care about.

"Greg, if you want to support this guy, his ideas and work, buy his books and give to his cause. That's what I do with the things I care about.
Nancy,
And your point... I bought his book. I guess the question is what is the appropriate path. To rely on a couple of biblical passages that have no explanatory power. Or to put together a puzzle of events that tells us what we all want to know. Could you be threatened by someone or a school of thought that is arrogant enough to think humans can figure it out?
I was listening to a podcast interview of Sean Carroll . He has just written a book called "Particle at the end of the Universe- The Search for the Higgs Boson." He claims that pure research often yields advances in unanticipated areas. The World Wide Web came about because of the scientific need to commisurate about their research. The power of Krauss' claims isn't that he is necessarily right. The power is that we will all most certainly benefit from that attitude which seeks to explain everything. Genesis and Hebrews make declarative statements that explain nothing. Would you prefer to stop there or suffer the arrogance of Krauss?

Nancy,A problem I have with Greg is that there is a plethora of credentialed people in this world that believe this and that and a discourse with Greg is like a trial where the prosecution's experts vie against the defense's experts. In that kind of discourse there is little room for those poor slobs like us that try to struggle along doing our own thinking. You can never talk with Greg, only with his various expert sources.

Greg said, "...there is a school of thought that thinks that this all just a waste of time."
I am curious what that school of thought is since over the months your targets have proven quite flexible. One moment it is all Christians and Jews, indeed, all religious people, sometimes sounding as it may even include Republicans, only to suddenly collapse to just Christians, and then even just certain Christians. So what is the school of thought that you refer to here?

Since when did "schools of thought" have to represent any one group. They are after all "schools of thought". There is a group of people that believe that Earth is flat . There is another group that thinks that the Earth is hollow and below the surface there is a civilization that is more advanced than ours. I suppose these could be thought of as "schools of thought". Now if you look around the room at your next Kiwannis Club meeting and you find most of your members don't have any use for basic research , then you are getting warm. Or if you happen to read the platform of one of your state's political parties and it says that they reject critical thinking , then you are getting close Or if you have a Governor of a state who now says that his party has to quit being the "stupid party" while having in the past signed a bill demanding that creationism be taught in the public schools - well then there you have it. The school of thought is just that. I'll leave who has it up to your powerul tools of analysis.

GregSchools of thought by definition represent groups.Your attempt to justify stupidity boggles the mind, one school of thought may differ from another, but each is that groups "school of thought".You say so yourself.Do you have it in you to back a specific school of thought over another?Do so.I care not what the Kiwannis Club thinks, I don't talk to them.What about you, what school of thought do you align yourself with?

Greg,Let me be clear that I certainly don't think the study of all these things is a waste of time. My husband and I watched a program on PBS just the other night that covered most of these discoveries and we were impressed. It's an amazing universe and world we live in. When someone sets out to prove God didn't do it and Christian engage in mystical thinking, however, I think they lose some people at that point. The program we watched didn't do that. It just explained recent discoveries. My post was to point out that the Bible doesn't contradict the discoveries this man is talking about. The Bible never says the earth in flat or that it sits on the back of an elephant. Instead it made declarative statements thousands of years before this man studied the subject and came to a similar conclusion. That being that what is seen is not made out of what was visible--meaning what we see is made out of the invisible, and without it being made it is simply cold, dark and empty--where Krauss and Hitchens believe we are headed again.

"...never says the earth is flat or that it sits on the back of an elephant."Come on Nancy, you are before a learned fellow who reads Krauss and listens to Carroll, you can't be making those mistakes. It's a turtle, not an elephant; read Stephen Hawking, who when he writes about turtles makes a very powerful point that is very relevant to this exchange.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down

Oh Xavier!Cut her some slack. There's a lot on her plate.What with Greg, Jim H., Zach and others to contend with.Wrong animal, big deal.Maybe it was symbolical and she means the world would be a better place if carried on the backs of republicans.

Yes, Nancy. The problem with atheism is the bleakness for humankind that accompany it. The faith battles always seem to focus on the logic of faith and ignore the yearning within people to want to be of some worth. I would take this opportunity to ask Greg, "Of what lasting worth are you?" I could elaborate, but the central question is as I put it here. The faithful can say they accept the challenge to follow the will of God and in the end their worth is weighed against that effort.

So "schools of thought" just happens to be any group you dislike at the moment, Greg? Another term for "those fools," to put it mildly and meaning anyone who disagrees with you on any topic and are therefore not as smart as you?

No Xavier. Schools of thought are ways that people think about things that we find of more than just passing importance. I am not the nexus of determination of what they are. There is a school of thought that believes that one day we will have figured out how the complex chemistry of life happened. I am a member of that school of thought. I aree with it. So now I have falsified your statement. Not all achools of thought "just happens to be any group you dislike at the moment because they disagree with [me]" Isn't this supposed be the way it works. You make a claim. I falsify it, Then you know the claim isn't valid. Now try that on jut about any relgious claim.

Though a set of laws holds this universe together that happens to also allow our kind of life to exist, by in large this Universe is unrelentingly hostile to our type of life. And now there is no guarantee that this is the only universe to exist.---------------------------------------------Well, it is nice that your sources are not ready to guarantee that no other universes exist since that is a no brainier idea. Given that a universe is by definition "all there is" then other universes are not of much import to us. However, I am not unaware of the claims of some scientists to be able to test for other universes through some effects on our own, but that is a far away investigation. If the universe is hostile to the existence of life, then why does life spring up on earth like popcorn everywhere? I understand that life does not spring up on every piece of rock around, but if one learns to comprehend the magnitude of the universe then if life pops up on every millionth rock then that is almost an infinity of rocks supporting life in our universe since for practical purposes the universe contains an infinity of rocks. There are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand on every beach in the world. Needless to say there are a lot more rocks than stars too.Indeed, if the universe is so extremely hostile to life then maybe Genesis got it right and it required an omnipotent power to create it in such an unlikely environment and we are then indeed the singular example of life in the universe, wouldn't you think? We can't have our cake and eat it too, can we?

Here is something that at least I find interesting. Most comments in the comments sections of articles in this Journal are very negative about Obama and the Democrats. The readership here is very conservative. As you guys know I dislike too much negativity, on either side although I am not always above it, and instead try to search for something positive or constructive to say. So in the last few days I tried to be actively constructive and the reactions are fascinating. In,"How a Trust Deficit is Hurting the Economy,"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323854904578264161278400462.html#articleTabs%3Dcommentsyesterday I posted, in the first page of the comments section (the link above doesn't seem to want to take you to that first page but it takes you close enough),"I think we all better start looking for the positive things around us and start pumping some optimism into the economy, and save the rhetoric for the next electoral campaign. Otherwise we are just going to chase our tails down a rat's hole. For starters there are positive signs in the housing industry, which has traditionally led to more solid recoveries. As to the Fed, Bernanke is not doing as bad considering that he is between a rock and a hard place."Then today someone accused me of wanting happy thoughts. I answered with,"Not necessarily happy thoughts, just constructive thoughts, Chris. Without them nothing gets fixed."I find it fascinating how negative everybody here is. Lots of recommendations for the most negative, zero if you try to search for constructive things to say. I have actually developed a theory of social change and development that identifies properties and processes required for effective change. Change produces stress so one of the process steps is to relieve that stress, i.e. to let off steam. If this step doesn't work well, you bottle up stress and it can then result in a sudden explosive release, the stuff of riots in the street that we see, for instance, in Egypt today. A well functioning society provides for lots of opportunities to relieve that stress before it becomes destructive. I suppose letting off steam in the comments section of articles in this Journal is as good a way as any :)."

XavierI understand and that's why, even on boring weekends, I stay here.Conservative, and I am one, tend to gang up on what they perceive as liberal. But the reverse is also true.The Wall Street Journal is not known for leaning left, and if you venture from this topic site you will find many hard line conservatives ready with convenient insults. But we are all held to a certain level of respect here.Not true on conservative sites such as The Blaze, Fox News Forum or the N.Y Post forum.They, to me, are too one sided and often disgusting.But never do they deny the participation of an opposing view.But remember, their are many liberal, leftist sites and blogs that will deny a conservative participation in any discussion where the creed and opinions may be challenged, even if honest and mannered.Happened to me more than once.I was actually informed by the administrator of one site that it was a pro Obama site and found my registration voided.So, tell me, which is the better choice, do we shut down opinions because we disagree, or do we shut down opinions because we disagree with the verbiage used to express them?To me, neither is right.

Xavier said....... I have actually developed a theory of social change and development that identifies properties and processes required for effective change.-------------------------------------I don't see where change requires, or is even influenced, by logical thinking. For example, Caesar changed the history of Rome when he crossed the Rubicon river and returned to Rome as a victorious Roman general against the warnings of the Roman senate not to return to Rome. The reason being that the ruling senate feared, and rightfully so, that Caesar was a threat to the Roman republic.The result was Caesar's assignation and an internal war that resulted in a new dynasty of individual rule for Rome How would your theory of change have worked in this specific case? The test of any theory that would predict the future is to match it with historical events to judge it.Perhaps I just don't understand it enough to discuss it, but this thought came to mind.

Well, after that diatribe against religion I wonder what the rest of us have left to talk about on the subject. Perhaps that is why we all meander all over the dialog landscape. But then you complain about that so we just can't win no matter what.If you stick around I am going to have to nominate you for the group subject matter policeman.

Larry, here is a 3 sentence proof that atheism is a faith-based belief:1. Atheists hold that atheism cannot be proven.2. Faith is the belief in that which cannot be proven.3. Therefore, atheism is a faith-based belief.That means atheists are in no position to criticize religion or religious people. That means atheists have no special relationship with science or logic.It means that atheism is irrational and a pure figment of the imagination.

LarryI believe this is your second or so post here.You are getting no better at communication and understanding, but that was never your goal.You are an antagonist and a trouble maker.Here, we strive for understanding, though the attempt is not always successful.You strive for conflict.Make a change in your approach to others or understand why everyone, even those who may see a point, will shun you and your antagonistic comments.

Well, I hope Larry will accept this post as being sufficiently related to our founding father, Zack's initiating question. Indeed with the new political orientation of the government as a combination of both political and moral rule I think politics is now bound into our modern moral codes. I call that wing the politico-moral.One of the things I harp and nag everybody about is the danger of our government running out of control of the populace. I see where Obama, being frustrated in his efforts to get a carbon tax legislated is clearly planning to use the EPA to make an end run around the congress.Without getting into the climate change, aka global warming debacle, I would like to ask the good people here what they make of that strategy in relation to our democratic republic constitutional government orientation in the past? In particular I wonder if the pro carbon tax believers have even a small qualm about this, or is it that the ends justify the means? Must we give up our old style constitutional rule because it is the only way to save the planet? I must say that viewed like that, the choice is clear.

Nancy:“By your own admission, computer source code designed by man can not come close to the abilities of the human design. Human knowledge and logic is not up to the task. That means our code is not written by us, but, in the opinion of you and Pinker, by nature.”Indeed, but the fundamentals are the same. Computer source code designed by man can’t come close to the abilities of the human brain YET; our knowledge isn’t sufficient YET. We make so much progress every year, though, that it isn’t hard to imagine developing powerful artificial intelligence in the future. “If Darwinian natural selection is our designer as Pinker suggests, then I believe we are the creation, not the designer. To say that we are all of nature and nature is us is the beginning of entering into the realm of religion.”Well, this is simply materialism. With mounting evidence that increasingly blurs the line between nature and humans, this may only be a religious perspective in the sense that one must have faith in the truth-seeking power of one’s own senses.

Indeed, but the fundamentals are the same.- - - Well . . . not exactly. Remember that all the advances in PC computers in your lifetime have been:Process fasterBetter Input / Output devicesSmaller and cheaper componentsDifferent Interfaces (Hard Drives, USB, Video)Number of bits used for processing (8 – 16 – 32 – 64)We haven’t seen any fundamental changes in how the PC really works. An Xbox is not really a huge advancement past the IBM desktop of 1984. Engineers just figured out how to cram more components into the box.About the closest we have come to mirror neural networks would be a connection machine, where up to 64,000 processors are linked together to allow data to transfer from processor to any other processor. The design is not to recreate the brain, but to allow for complex simulations were data from one point can affect nearby points. (Weather models, turbulence, complex systems). The problem is that it took a supercomputer just to program a connection machine. I doubt you’ll see a connection machine in your I-Pad any time soon.A PC is probably more akin in function to a cell using DNA / RNA (Program) to create proteins. A strand is split and we run down the chain sequentially to know what chemical pieces to assemble. Bits allow for 2 states (0 and 1) and a DNA strand allows for 4 states (different chemicals). You start somewhere in the strand and work in one direction.A neuron would contain both the processor and some memory. The neuron works by having hundreds of connection with other neurons. So smelling popcorn can simultaneously trigger memories of scary movies and the taste of Coca-Cola. I won’t try to unpack how a brain “really works” because, as Xavier notes, it’s still largely a black box from our understanding; and it wasn't really used as a template to design a microprocessor.Parts of the brain are also specialized. Reasoning, problem solving, and some speech functions happen in the Frontal lobe. The Temporal lobe handles sound, memory and speech. The Occipital lob handles visual processing. [e.g. seeing the banana.] The Hippocampus is critical for learning (i.e. converting short term memory to long term memory) but that is located in the limbic system, not in the lobes.http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/brains/structures

Okay. I’ll admit it; I just got schooled. Now, I think you did well to hedge your bets when you said “not exactly”, but you rightly emphasized a layer of complexity to the topic that my quick analogy did not cover. This is good stuff.

Bradley,How long has natural selection been designing our computer. Perhaps a billion years. How long have we been designing computers. Less than 100 years. I think I would give us a break. The other thing you forget is that computers nature has designed aren't exactly perfect. They are fragile and sometimes process information improperly. And the filtering mechanisms that we inherit, deny many if not most of us from fully understanding our environment. It seems that quite by accident we get folks capable of getting us out of the weeds. Our future designs may not be as adept at some things but they promise to be much more capable at others.

Zach,My question would be: What is the purpose of a mindless universe using natural forces to create consciousness and intelligence, and then having that intelligence create artificial intelligence all while heading for oblivion? By faith you hope for the development of artificial intelligence in the future, but to what end do you hope for all this? Is mankind going to save himself from a universe heading for its demise, or are we just trying to make life better until the end comes? Yes we are made out of the same material as the rest of nature, but that doesn't make us the same as a tree or a rock or a cloud. What evidence blurs the line between humanity and the rest of nature? What are you trying to say with that statement? If nature made a dog, can a dog one day make an artificial dog? I'm not sure why you think that if natural selection made man, than man can someday make artificial intelligence because we are a part of the nature that made man. You've lost me on this one.

James:“I always think, I have been thinking since before you were in diapers.I suggest that before you post a somewhat obnoxious comment (a winking smile doesn't cut it) to cover for your inability to refute...You think. I don't care the content of the discussion, the misuse of ‘empathy’ by you and others is ignorant and flagrant.”It’s ironic to criticize someone for not refuting a point when they added new information to the discussion and you failed to do so, wouldn’t you say? I explained to you quite plainly how empathy was absolutely the correct word in that situation, and you had nothing but personal attacks as a reply. I guess time spent thinking doesn’t necessarily equate to worthwhile thinking…

ZachThis habit of replying pages away from the original comment is clever, you can make claims to things you never did, knowing no one remembers.But if I site the page and quote you, you fare less well.Page 736(leaving out the ad hominem)"... The topic was the (sic) understanding God though (sic) the suffering of Christ. He felt a lot of physical pain and a lot of emotional torment as well. Have you ever had an experience where you felt either of those things? Even if you haven't been crucified, couldn't some of those experiences help you understand (at least to an extent) Christ's suffering? Think."What was the "added new information to the discussion"? The topic?Wasn't that there at the premise?And yes, I have felt physical pain and emotional... well let's just say, distress.But unless poking my finger can be extrapolated into the pain of being nailed to a cross, I have no experience, no understanding, so no empathy. All I can muster is sympathy. Sympathy for a person enduring something I could never imagine.As to the emotional tormentDo you think that men like you and me can understand to the point of empathy, the emotional state of a person who believes himself to be the Son of God, dying, while nailed to a cross?Understanding, "at least to an extent" is not empathy, it's sympathy.

James,Regarding your comment at,http://online.wsj.com/community/groups/religion-diversity-tolerance-governance/topics/do-we-need-religion-have?commentid=5382423to mine on the deeply held opinions of people that post in this Journal, I am not trying to shut down opinions, not at all, and I do agree that the WSJ sites are far and way the most civil. What is interesting to me is how deeply held those opinions are and, particularly, how deeply they divide people. As I travelled around the world and now read history, people have always been at each other's throats including, quite significantly, over ideology even when people profess they are not driven by it. Indeed, if you look at who does the attacking, you nearly always find some ideological motivator or excuse.One of the things I am trying to unravel in order to figure out how to address the divisiveness is whether ideology is indeed a motivator, or whether it is just an excuse used to cover up some deeper force --here it is usually easy to see in the case of the leader but what I am far more interested in is on how it works on those that follow that leader. Thus, take Greg's post higher up in that page on his reading of Krauss. It is definitely fascinating material I myself read continuously and when I am excited about what I read I tell others about it, including in this forum like with Harold Berman. But why use it, as Greg did, as a commentary on whole groups of people you disagree with?My interest in the subject comes from my interest in how to help people improve their situation. At first I came at it purely from an economic perspective but then I realized that what holds back economic development in most cases are social forces, and within that political forces. I then also realized that the process of change is immensely stressful for any number of reasons, and that there are people seeking power who are always looking and finding ways to use and capitalize on that stress. To do so they play to the uncertainties and fears that people have of the consequences of change and the fact that for the most part they don't understand those consequences, let alone how to cope with them. So those seeking power offer solutions, however false or inadequate they might be, and demonize those who don't see it their way, all just as part of a calculated plan. They soothe one side and demonize those that don't buy into their proposed solutions. For those that believe, it soon becomes ideological, i.e. a set of ideas that constitute their goals, expectations, and actions, all of which they defend by any means and, crucially to my quest for understanding of how to fix it, without compromise.Unfortunately those that disagree can't offer alternative solutions so they fall prey to precisely that with which they disagree with. And so it goes. All I am trying to do is figure out if there is some way of getting out of this morass short of people coming to blows or destroying that which they ostensibly are trying to improve. Failure to do so has historically eventually led to the demise of all organized societies, but even if this is not the case, as many still argue, some of the types of conflict it produces along the way tend to hold back economic development, which was my starting point.

Xavier,
It's funny you would call me out for using Krauss' notions on the origin of the Universe to refute other notions that have been repeated ad nauseum that contend that a deity created the Universe. Where were you then. And do you think that it wasn't one of Krauss' objectives in writing the book to state a hypothesis that is based on observation and analysis that says the universe could be the result of gravity and quantum fluctuations. That the energy in our "flat" universe is a zero sum game and in that scernario something could have come out of nothing. So why single me out when Krauss himself has been forceful in stating his opinion. I need only point you the Intelligence Squared debate conducted when Krauss was part of the two man team that took the affirmative position on the subject "Science Refutes Religion" . If anything it would appear that Krauss wants his book and his research to used in the manner that I used it. You sit silently as the religious make outrageous claims for their deity and mockingly declare that "DNA had to be designed". Yet when scientific research points to a different conclusion it is the person that points to the research that is at fault. This double standard you march around with is clear to anyone that has a shred of objectivity. You only play to your idealogical cohorts of which apparently any inane thing that they have to say is alright with you. Of course that is part of the playbook, isn't it. Accuse your opponent of the thing that you are guilty of. 1 Recommendation Link

And so it goes, round and round.At least they just make claims, unlike you, who demonizes them, and me (in my case just for pointing out and asking why you made a "commentary," which you did), for it.

XavierI re read my comment in your link, and see that toward the end I digressed a bit.I was never implying that you wanted to shut down opinion, I was referring to the liberal blogs vs. the WSJ site.The liberal site denies a view because it may oppose their mantra, this site denies a view if the verbiage falls outside the guidelines.I disagree with both practices, I prefer to know another's opinion, not be shielded from it, even if it uses harsh language.

BOAO, China—Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday stepped into the growing tensions on the Korean peninsula with a carefully worded warning that no country should be allowed to destabilize the world. Mr. Xi's language in a speech to the three-day Boao Forum for Asia appeared to be deliberately ambiguous, naming no nation directly. Acknowledging Asian "frictions" and "hot spots," Mr. Xi said, "No one should...

Biography
Updated May 20, 2013 4:57 p.m. ET
Houston 'Redneck white city down in Texas." That's how Houston Mayor Annise Parker
sums up the caricature of her town, and she wants everyone to know it's bunkum. Houston is "a really cool city," she says. "Open and entrepreneurial and welcoming." It's also booming. The mayor herself is a walking testament to the cosmopolitan contrarian reality of modern Houston. Annise Parker is a Democrat in a deep-red state, the first openly gay mayor of a major American city. She's a social liberal who's also a former oil-industry executive with a pro-business attitude running what may be the nation's least-regulated metropolis. Houston's recent track record is startling. For the calendar year ending in February, it saw the fastest pace of job growth (4.5%) among the country's 20 largest metropolitan areas. (With a population of 2.1 million, it's the fourth-largest U.S. city.) In 2011, the last year such data are available, Houston had the fastest-growing large metropolitan economy, at 3.7%. Add to that a cost of living that is 7.8% below the U.S. average—New York is 53.4% above the average—and you can see the attraction for waves of new arrivals. Housing costs run a third less than the average in the 29 largest metro areas. Adjusting for these lower costs, Houston has the highest per-capita income of any city in the nation. Enlarge Image
Terry Shoffner The mayor, who is 56, and I are discussing the city's makeover at one of its hottest new restaurants. Underbelly, Ms. Parker's choice for lunch, is in the Montrose neighborhood where she lives. "This was a huge lesbian bar," she says, before the neighborhood turned "trendy" and places like Underbelly moved in. As diners fill the capacious restaurant, Ms. Parker notes that Houstonians eat out more often than anyone else in America. Like Texas as a whole, Houston sells itself as "business friendly," and Ms. Parker ticks off the attractions—ease of permitting, unobtrusive regulations and low taxes. She also supports Houston's limited restrictions on land use, which some here call its real secret sauce. Without zoning, Houston can adjust to shifting market demands—whether for townhouse complexes or retail outfits—faster than most any other city. It looks unwieldy to anyone of the urban-planning persuasion, but it also keeps prices down. Tory Gattis,
who writes the Houston Strategies blog, says: "I'd argue we may be the most libertarian city in America. Live and let live; strong property rights; not much corruption; small business culture." The economic dynamism has demographic consequences. A couple of years ago, Ms. Parker says, she argued with New York filmmaker Spike Lee
over whose hometown was "the most international city in the U.S." The debate isn't as lopsided as it might seem to a non-Houstonian. The city has surpassed New York as the country's most racially and ethnically diverse, according to a study last year by Rice University. One in five residents was born outside the U.S. The city attracted the second-highest number of new, foreign-born residents in the first decade of this century, after the more populous New York. A Manhattan Institute report last year named Houston and Dallas the country's least segregated cities. Hispanics are hardly the only newcomers. The Korean, South Asian and Chinese communities are a backbone of the small-business community. European expatriates work in energy and at the Texas Medical Center—which, this being Texas, touts itself as the world's largest. No ethnic group makes up a majority, and Hispanics, whites, Asians and African-Americans are evenly represented. Houston's "melting pot" makes it "impossible for any one group to dominate another," says Fred Hofheinz,
who was mayor in the 1970s. Leave the politics of ethnic and racial division to other places. Stephen Klineberg
of Rice argues that in some 30 years all of America will look like Houston today. Conservatives and liberals can both find something to like in Houston's post-racial, post-ethnic present. Certainly broiling heat and sopping humidity aren't the draws. "We're never going to have the climate or the views of San Francisco," says Ms. Parker, who shares the Houstonian habit of managing to sound both proud of and deprecating about the city. Likening Houston to "a good soup where all the ingredients come together," she says: "All the things that people say you have to have to have a great city, maybe we don't have. But it's still worth it." The phrase echoes the city's promotional campaign: "Houston. It's Worth It." This being a town that doesn't take itself too seriously, the campaign's website explains that Houston is "worth it" despite a list of 20 "afflictions" that include "the flying cockroaches," "the ridicule" and "the refineries." It wasn't always worth it. A visiting journalist in 1946 called Houston "mostly ugly and barren, a city without a single good restaurant." Over several decades, it went through a couple of oil booms and busts. The last petered out in the early 1990s, when former Mayor Bob Lanier
invested in roads and policing to prepare the city for when the good times returned. Houston's revival is of course rooted in the current oil and gas bonanza, though less than in the past. Energy is half the city's economy, down from nearly 90% in the early 1980s. Houston is also now a global energy center. Anything related to the exploration, transport or refining of crude, gas or biofuels anywhere can be found here. Ms. Parker spent almost two decades in the oil and gas business, working for former U.S. Commerce Secretary and Republican Robert Mosbacher's energy company, Mosbacher Energy. "We were a one industry town," she says. "That's clearly not workable for anybody." She calls herself a "booster" of oil and gas but says Houston's strength comes from its ability to adapt to new trends. "We're 50% energy today but that's not just oil and gas," she says. "It is solar, it's wind, it's biofuels, it's transmission lines. We're a headquarters city—we've never been a big producing area. So we have to make sure that we maintain the ability to be the headquarters, the brain trust." Another driver of growth is the Texas Medical Center, which now has more commercial real-estate space than all of downtown Dallas—a particular point of Texas-rivalry pride. Biotech is taking off. The shipping port has, by some measures, become the nation's busiest. As a city council member and controller in the 1990s and 2000s, Ms. Parker built a political coalition of liberals, gays and business. When she decided to run for mayor in 2009, the business groups abandoned her, she says, because they doubted her electability as a lesbian, which she says was "frustrating and a little bit hurtful." She won narrowly. Those bad feelings are forgotten. Business appreciates Ms. Parker's response to the city's budget crisis and they're behind her bid for a third—and under the law, final—two-year term this fall. Coming into office in 2010 amid a recession, she laid off 776 city employees, starting with her deputy chief of staff. "I wanted to show it was going to start at the top," Ms. Parker says. No firefighters or cops were fired, but public swimming pools and libraries were shut. She also didn't raise taxes. "Raising taxes, that's the easy answer," the mayor says. Ms. Parker did impose the first drainage fee on properties to fund street improvements that would reduce flooding. It was dubbed by some as a "rain tax," but she says most Houstonians understand the need to invest in such basic public works. Ms. Parker plays up the need for a "working city" to serve people here and to attract those still put off by Houston's reputation. She wants to find ways to liven up downtown. A citywide network of bike and running trails is being built. Early one morning, I joined her and a few dozen others for a six-mile bicycle ride promoting the city's new bike-sharing program—yes, in this oil-guzzling, no-zoning-laws sprawl of some 600 car-friendly square miles. Some common urban ills remain. The public-employee pension funds are a mess. The funding shortfall is "the only cloud on our horizon," she says. Her critics says she hasn't shown the daring or urgency to take on government unions to fix the problem, but that's been a bipartisan failure nationwide. "If you look at her record in governing," a political consultant I meet in Houston says, "you'd think she was a conservative." Hearing this description, Ms. Parker doesn't choke on her Korean braised goat and dumplings. "There used to be jokes about how a Democrat in Texas was a moderate Republican in Connecticut," she says. "I do think there's a sweet spot there, where government is a tool to make peoples' lives better. . . . But I'm fiscally conservative. I came out of a conservative industry. I understand making payroll and balancing books." She also doesn't sound like a mayor who will tell you what size soda to buy. "I'm the black sheep in my family," she continues. "I'm from a long line of Republicans. Everyone else in my family is a Republican. The social issues are what drove me away from the Republican Party." Situated on a bayou and close to Louisiana, Houston mixes the South's hospitality and the West's independent streak and tolerance of differences. Ms. Parker cites these qualities to explain her political career. "The vast majority of Houstonians are pragmatic and they judge me for what I do, not what I am." She is a former president of the Houston GBLT Caucus and militated for gay rights in the 1990s. In her various stints as an elected city official, she emphasized financial matters and played down social issues. At least her mayoral victory, she says, got Houston a bit of attention for defying typecasting by outsiders. "I'm not a spokesperson for the gay community," she adds. Gay marriage is personal. "I've been with my life partner for 22 years." They have three children. "I want to marry her." Ms. Parker is holding out for Texas to legalize gay marriage. "I may be old and creaky, but it's gonna happen," she says. "This is a war we've already won. There are still battles left to fight. . . . mopping up operations." Anything, they keep telling you, is possible here. Mr. Kaminski is a member of the Journal's editorial board. Email
