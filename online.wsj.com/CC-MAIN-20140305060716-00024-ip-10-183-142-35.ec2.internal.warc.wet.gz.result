NYSE, Nasdaq Consider Cooperating to Address Glitches
New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Are Said to Be Discussing Backing Up Each Other's Data Feeds
By
Jacob Bunge
Sept. 25, 2013 6:59 p.m. ET
With technology glitches becoming more common, the country's two stock-exchange giants are pondering a scenario some might have considered unlikely: teaming to protect one another in the event of breakdowns. Longtime rivals NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. are discussing a plan with other exchanges in which each company would run a backup for the other's benchmark stock-pricing data, according to people involved in the...

Updated Feb. 1, 2013 11:06 a.m. ET
Some affluent buyers are getting the keys to their new home without putting a penny down. It's 100% financing—the same strategy that pushed many homeowners into foreclosure during the housing bust. Banks say these loans are safer: They're almost exclusively being offered to clients with sizable assets, and they often require two forms of collateral—the house and a portion of the client's investment portfolio in lieu of a traditional cash down payment. In most cases, borrowers end up with one loan and one monthly payment. Depending on the lender and the borrower, roughly 60% to 80% of the loan can be pegged to the home's value while the remaining 20% to 40% can be secured by investments. On a $2 million primary residence, for instance, the borrower could get a $2 million loan, which would require a pledge of assets in an investment portfolio to cover what could have been, say, a $500,000 down payment. The pledged assets can remain fully invested, earning returns as normal, without disrupting the client's investment goals. While these affluent clients may be flush with cash, this strategy allows them to get into a home without tying up funds or making withdrawals from interest-earning accounts. And given the market's gains combined with low borrowing rates in recent years, some banks say clients are pursuing 100% financing as an arbitrage play—where the return on their investments is bigger than the rate they pay on the loan, which can be as low as 2.5%. Some institutions offer only adjustable rates with these loans, which could become more expensive if rates rise. In most cases, the investment account must be held by the same institution that's providing the loan. These loans also provide tax benefits. Since borrowers don't have to liquidate their investment portfolios to get financing, they can avoid the capital-gains tax. And in some cases, they can still tap into the mortgage-interest deduction. (Borrowers can usually deduct interest payments on up to $1 million of mortgage debt.) While these loans make up a small portion of banks' overall lending, demand for them has been rising. BNY Mellon Wealth Management's mortgage team says it experienced a 10% increase in requests for 100% jumbo-mortgage financing involving clients' investment portfolios in 2012 compared with a year prior.

which offers up to 100% financing just to medical doctors through its private-banking divisions in eight states, including Arizona, Oklahoma and Texas, says there has been a roughly 25% increase (or about 100 more borrowers) in this lending from a year ago. Also, at Citi Private Bank, applications have been growing over the past two years. "Demand is two to three times what it normally is," says Peter Ferrara,
managing director of the private bank's residential real estate. Some banks are using this product to lure in clients, such as BOK Financial's offer, which is available to new physicians. To provide the loan, the bank must first receive proof that the borrower has cash or investments, like stocks or mutual funds, that equal 10% of the borrowed amount. (The company says it doesn't seek a pledge of those assets but just wants to know that borrowers can meet their obligations over time.) What to consider before signing up: • Portfolio restrictions. The amount clients can borrow against investment accounts will depend on what the portfolio comprises. In most cases, they can get up to 95% if the account comprises cash, up to about 80% if it's bonds, and between 50% and 75% with stocks. Withdrawing pledged funds is typically restricted while the loan is outstanding. • Relationship pricing. To get the lowest rate, clients who already have significant assets at a particular bank should consider applying for 100% financing there. • Underwriting standards. Borrowers will still need to pass regular underwriting requirements, including having a high credit score, a low amount of overall debt—including student debt—and providing documentation of substantial income or assets.

For years, as the principal public voice for the Southern Baptist Convention, the country's biggest evangelical group, Richard Land warned of a "radical homosexual agenda" and pushed for a federal ban on same-sex marriage. His successor, Russell Moore, sounded a different note when the Supreme Court in June struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. "Love your gay and lesbian neighbors," Mr. Moore wrote in a flier, "How Should Your Church Respond," sent to the convention's estimated...

President Barack Obama will visit Myanmar this month, the first trip to the country by a U.S. president, in another step toward engagement with the long-isolated nation. The trip underscores a remarkable transformation by Myanmar as a country under its leader, President Thein Sein, who in less than two years has taken his nation from pariah status to host of a U.S. presidential visit. Mr. Obama announced the U.S. would resume ties with Myanmar, also known as Burma, on his last trip to Asia, a year ago. At that time, he said Mr. Thein Sein had made enough progress in opening up his country, a military dictatorship just two years ago, to justify sending Secretary of State Hillary Clinton there for a diplomatic visit. The Clinton trip, the first by a U.S. secretary of state in more than 50 years, paved the way toward easing U.S. financial sanctions on Myanmar and restoration of full diplomatic ties. But the visit by Mr. Obama constitutes a further advance in U.S. relations with Myanmar and comes amid a debate about whether the Obama administration is moving too quickly or too slowly in coaxing the government toward greater openness. While there, Mr. Obama plans to meet with Mr. Thein Sein, who has helped move his nation toward reforms and engagement with the West. He will also meet with political activist and Nobel Peace Price winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who has encouraged Mr. Obama to more rapidly open U.S. ties to her country. He also will speak to civil-society groups "to encourage Burma's ongoing democratic transition," the White House said. "It's an opportunity to support the democratic transition in Burma and build a bilateral relationship," a White House official added. Some human-rights campaigners, though, fear the U.S. has moved too quickly and opened the possibility that Myanmar's military will be the largest beneficiary of increased investment in the country. At the same time, long-simmering ethnic conflict in the country has flared recently, underscoring that Mr. Thein Sein still has much work to do to satisfy U.S. conditions for further engagement. Myanmar has pledged to end its military ties with North Korea—but it isn't clear it has yet, fueling American weapons-proliferation concerns. Mr. Obama's four-day Asia trip, which begins Nov. 17, will include visits to Thailand and Cambodia, the White House said Thursday. The visit to Myanmar was welcomed by people there as a symbol of their country's progress and with the hope that Mr. Obama will use the visit to fully lift long-standing U.S. sanctions, leading to more U.S. investment. Myanmar has long been "ostracized by many as a sort of a leper. Now, his visit will inspire us," said Maung Maung Lay, vice president of the country's Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Nay Zin Latt, economic adviser to Mr. Thein Sein, predicted that sanctions would soon be permanently revoked and said Myanmar "is now really getting into the new times and the new world." The engagement with Myanmar also has implications for American efforts to counter Chinese influence in the region. Washington has seen the political opening in Myanmar as a unique opportunity to partner with a country that has traditionally been among China's closest allies. —Jay Solomon, Keith Johnson and Celine Fernandez contributed to this article.
