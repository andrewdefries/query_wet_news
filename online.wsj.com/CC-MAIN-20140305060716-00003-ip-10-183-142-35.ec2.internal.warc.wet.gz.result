WASHINGTON—The snowstorm moving into the mid-Atlantic region has largely bypassed the nation's capital, with less than an inch of precipitation falling at Reagan National Airport by midday Wednesday. Rain and wet snow were pelting Washington, and the National Weather Service forecast an accumulation of as many as 6 inches of snow. The federal government and most school systems closed in anticipation of a major storm. The storm is expected to taper off by Wednesday night, and temperatures are expected stay just above freezing. The federal government decided early Wednesday to close for the day, and the tracking service FlightAware said more than 1,300 flights into and out of Washington airports were canceled. The city government deployed 230 plows Tuesday night, and utility crews prepared for heavy, wet snow that can contribute to power outages. Enlarge Image

The worst winter storm of the season hit the Chicago area on Tuesday.
Brian Kersey/Getty Images Washington Wire D.C. 'Snowquester' Doesn't Fail to Disappoint The Metrorail system, which usually maintains a close-to-normal schedule when there are fewer than six inches of snow, was running normally Wednesday. The storm, which originated in Canada, hit other areas of the U.S. earlier, starting Sunday in Montana and traveling across Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois on its way to Washington. Some government plans were rearranged because of the storm. The House moved up a vote to Wednesday on a measure to continue funding the federal government, and the Securities and Exchange Commission moved back an open meeting to Thursday from Wednesday. President Barack Obama still planned to have dinner with a group of Senate Republicans Wednesday night. And the Commerce Department and Federal Reserve released data reports as scheduled. When asked by reporters in the Capitol what she thinks of Washington's reaction to snow, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) scoffed, "Oh come on, I'm from Massachusetts!" —Kristina Peterson contributed to this article. Write to Sarah Portlock at sarah.portlock@dowjones.com Email
