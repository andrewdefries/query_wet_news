NAACP leader: Stop and frisk a 'national priority'

Associated Press
NEW YORK — Ending the New York Police Department's extensive use of stop and frisk is a top goal for the nation's oldest civil rights organization, NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said Tuesday in pressing for new laws to rein in a practice he said amounted to racial injustice on a massive scale.
"Stop and frisk is the largest local racial profiling program in the country," Jealous said at a rally outside New York's City Hall. "Shutting it down is a national priority for the NAACP."
The NYPD has made 5 million of the stops in the past decade, fueling a debate that has reached what could prove a pivotal moment this year. While the City Council weighs proposals to create new rules for the stops and new oversight for the NYPD, a civil rights trial over the tactic is unfolding in federal court.
Tuesday's demonstration was designed to keep up momentum toward passing new stop and frisk laws after City Council Speaker Christine Quinn agreed last month to support a related proposal: a plan to create an inspector general for the police. That plan, which has yet to crystallize into legislation, grew out of concerns about both stop and frisk and the department's widespread surveillance of Muslims, as disclosed in a series of stories by The Associated Press.
Civil rights leaders, city lawmakers, Muslim advocates and others at the rally stressed that they wanted to make sure reform didn't stop with an inspector general.
"We've come a long way with the inspector general bill" but it's also crucial to pass the others, City Councilman Jumaane Williams said.
Proponents are focusing on a measure that would give people more latitude to sue if they believe they were stopped because of their race, an idea critics say would open floodgates to litigation. Other provisions would require to officers making stops to explain why and give their names.
Quinn said Tuesday she was continuing to negotiate with the advocates over the measures.
The Supreme Court has said it's legal for police to stop, question and sometimes pat down people they believe are acting suspiciously, but who may not meet the probable-cause standard for an arrest. The federal trial seeks broad changes in how the NYPD can use the tactic.
Critics say it harasses innocent people and reflects racial profiling. More than 80 percent of those stopped are black or Hispanic.
The NYPD and Mayor Michael Bloomberg have said stop and frisk helps drive down crime and violence and the stops are based on valid suspicions, not racial profiling.
"Nobody likes to get stopped," Bloomberg said last week, but "if it's a question of stopping and annoying you or saving your life, I know which one we're going to do."
After years of being something of a side issue in city politics, stop and frisk has gained profile in the last year from the court case, some prominent protests and the political dynamics surrounding this year's mayoral race.

Dutch to Take 'Breather' From Austerity Cuts
By
Maarten van Tartwijk and Robin van Daalen Updated April 12, 2013 1:46 p.m. ET
AMSTERDAM—The Dutch government is taking a more relaxed approach toward austerity and delaying changes in jobless benefits in a bid to restore consumer confidence, revive the economy and make it easier to meet European Union budget targets next year. The move is the latest sign that the Netherlands, one of the more fiscally hawkish members in the euro zone and a steadfast ally of Germany, is softening its hard-line stance as it...

KABUL—A man wearing an Afghan uniform opened fire on coalition forces in eastern Afghanistan Saturday, killing three service members in an apparent insider attack, coalition officials said. Further details on the circumstances of the attack weren't immediately available. Afghan and coalition officials are investigating the incident, the International Security Assistance Force said in a statement. If confirmed, this would be the eighth such case in which an Afghan soldier or policeman turned a weapon on coalition allies this year. The most recent incident took place in Kandahar in July, when an Afghan soldier shot and killed a Slovak soldier before defecting to the Taliban. So-called "green-on-blue" attacks became a major crisis for the international coalition last year. At least 61 coalition troops were killed in 48 separate attacks, undermining trust between Afghan and coalition troops and adding to the unpopularity of the 12-year war. "It's absolutely devastating because you break that bond of trust," a senior coalition official said in a recent interview before Saturday's attack. In response to last year's wave of attacks, the coalition and its Afghan allies introduced tighter security measures, sharply curbing the number of insider attacks. Members of the coalition who work closely with Afghan troops are now accompanied by armed "guardian angels," and new Afghan recruits are closely scrutinized to reduce the chances of Taliban infiltration. Joint patrols between Afghan and coalition forces are also much less common, further reducing the potential for green-on-blue attacks. "We are constantly refining our approach to reduce the potential for insider threats to coalition and ANSF [Afghan national security force] personnel," said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Will Griffin. The Taliban often exploit such incidents for propaganda purposes. "We have always given a hero welcome to these young fighters," said Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar in a message released earlier this summer.
