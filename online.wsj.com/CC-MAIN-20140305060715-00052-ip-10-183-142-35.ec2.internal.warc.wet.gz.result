Por RACHEL EMMA SILVERMAN
Es probable que en los minutos que le tome leer este artículo haga una pausa para revisar su celular, responda un mensaje de texto, lea un correo electrónico o eche un vistazo a los mensajes en Facebook o Twitter. También podría ser distraído por la conversación sobre el hijo pequeño de un colega o un compañero de trabajo podría detenerse en su escritorio para hacerle una pregunta rápida.La distracción en la oficina no es nada nuevo, pero conforme se multiplican las pantallas y los gerentes presionan a los empleados para que hagan más con menos, las empresas indican que el problema se está agudizando y está afectando sus negocios.
Muchas compañías se están percatando de que, al menos parcialmente, tienen la culpa.

La tecnología digital ha incrementado la productividad significativamente, pero el día laboral moderno parece estar específicamente diseñado para destruir la atención individual. Las oficinas abiertas y el énfasis en el trabajo colaborativo deja a los empleados indefensos frente al cotorreo de sus colegas. La incesante ola de reuniones y comunicaciones internas significa que tienen que arreglárselas para realizar su "verdadero trabajo" cuando puedan, ya sea temprano en la mañana o en horas de la tarde. Eso sin siquiera mencionar la necesidad de combatir la tentación de los mensajes y las actualizaciones en las redes sociales. "Es una epidemia", sentencia Lacy Roberson, directora de aprendizaje y desarrollo organizacional del sitio de subastas en línea eBay Inc. En la mayoría de las empresas, puntualiza, cuesta "terminar el trabajo diario con todas estas distracciones". Estudios muestran que los empleados son interrumpidos —o se interrumpen— aproximadamente una vez cada tres minutos, con numerosas distracciones tanto humanas como digitales. Después de una distracción, un trabajador puede demorar unos 23 minutos en retomar su tarea original, explica Gloria Mark, profesora de la Universidad de California en Irvine, quien estudia las distracciones digitales.
Las compañías ensayan estrategias para mantener la concentración de sus empleados. Algunas limitan el correo electrónico interno —una empresa de hecho lo prohibió por completo— mientras que otras reducen el número de proyectos que los trabajadores pueden abordar a la vez. Jamey Jacobs, vicepresidente divisional de Abbott Vascular, una filial de la empresa de salud Abbott Laboratories, se percató el año pasado de que sus 200 empleados habían acumulado estrés al tratar de no perder la concentración en medio de la ráfaga cotidiana de correos electrónicos y reuniones. "Se volvió algo frustrante en lo personal al no estar terminando las labores que querían completar", afirma. Los asistentes a las reuniones revisaban a menudo sus mensajes, intentando hacer varias cosas a la vez y perdían la concentración. Parte de la solución para el equipo de Jacobs fue una tecnología que a menudo pasa desapercibida: el teléfono. Jacobs y el consultor de productividad Daniel Markovitz hallaron que los empleados se comunicaban casi todo el tiempo a través del correo electrónico, independientemente de que el asunto fuera común y corriente o urgente, como un problema con los sistemas. Jacobs y Markovitz les dijeron al equipo que dejaran que la importancia y la complejidad del mensaje determinaran si se iban a comunicar por celular, el teléfono de la oficina o el correo electrónico. Los mensajes verdaderamente urgentes y los problemas complejos merecían llamadas telefónicas o conversaciones en persona, mientras que el correo electrónico se reservaría para los asuntos que podían esperar.
Ahora, los empleados usan el teléfono más seguido, envían menos correos internos y dicen que cuentan con mayor claridad sobre lo que es y no es urgente, aunque Jacobs sostiene que el personal debe mantenerse al corriente de los correos enviados por los clientes o colegas fuera del grupo. Roberson, la ejecutiva de eBay, recientemente instituyó como norma no usar dispositivos electrónicos durante algunas reuniones de su equipo, un cambio que las ha vuelto más eficientes, indica. No todas las distracciones perjudican la productividad. Mark dice que la gente tiende a trabajar más rápido cuando anticipa interrupciones. Aunque la precisión de su trabajo no se ve disminuida por las constantes interrupciones, el nivel de estrés de los empleados crece en forma significativa, manifiesta. En el grupo de software y servicios de Intel Corp., en el cual trabajan unas 14.000 personas, los empleados estaban preocupados porque no contaban con el tiempo suficiente para pensar más a fondo sobre la mejor forma de abordar problemas porque pasaban demasiado tiempo intentando mantenerse al corriente de las tareas cotidianas. Los gerentes decidieron, por lo tanto, implementar un programa piloto que permitiera reservar varias horas a la semana para hacer un trabajo más enfocado en un problema. Durante cuatro horas semanales de "tiempo para pensar", los empleados no tienen que responder correos electrónicos ni asistir a reuniones, a menos que se trate de algo urgente o si son parte de proyectos colaborativos.

Aereo Inc.'s upstart TV streaming service has provoked a legal onslaught from broadcast networks. But even if it wins that fight, it still has to overcome more-pedestrian issues, like making sure it can pay for the electricity it needs. The service depends on tiny antennas assigned to each of its individual users, who rent them to stream broadcast TV channels over the Web. Each of those antennas, which Aereo warehouses in centralized facilities, uses five to six watts of power. On their own, that isn't a whole lot—a...

Updated Nov. 2, 2009 11:15 p.m. ET
The biggest energy innovation of the decade is natural gas—more specifically what is called "unconventional" natural gas. Some call it a revolution. Yet the natural gas revolution has unfolded with no great fanfare, no grand opening ceremony, no ribbon cutting. It just crept up. In 1990, unconventional gas—from shales, coal-bed methane and so-called "tight" formations—was about 10% of total U.S. production. Today it is around 40%, and growing fast, with shale gas by far the biggest part. The potential of this "shale gale" only really became clear around 2007. In Washington, D.C., the discovery has come later—only in the last few months. Yet it is already changing the national energy dialogue and overall energy outlook in the U.S.—and could change the global natural gas balance. From the time of the California energy crisis at the beginning of this decade, it appeared that the U.S. was headed for an extended period of tight supplies, even shortages, of natural gas. While gas has many favorable attributes—as a clean, relatively low-carbon fuel—abundance did not appear to be one of them. Prices had gone up, but increased drilling failed to bring forth additional supplies. The U.S., it seemed, was destined to become much more integrated into the global gas market, with increasing imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). But a few companies were trying to solve a perennial problem: how to liberate shale gas—the plentiful natural gas supplies locked away in the impermeable shale. The experimental lab was a sprawling area called the Barnett Shale in the environs of Fort Worth, Texas. Enlarge Image
Getty Images The companies were experimenting with two technologies. One was horizontal drilling. Instead of merely drilling straight down into the resource, horizontal wells go sideways after a certain depth, opening up a much larger area of the resource-bearing formation. The other technology is known as hydraulic fracturing, or "fraccing." Here, the producer injects a mixture of water and sand at high pressure to create multiple fractures throughout the rock, liberating the trapped gas to flow into the well. The critical but little-recognized breakthrough was early in this decade—finding a way to meld together these two increasingly complex technologies to finally crack the shale rock, and thus crack the code for a major new resource. It was not a single eureka moment, but rather the result of incremental experimentation and technical skill. The success freed the gas to flow in greater volumes and at a much lower unit cost than previously thought possible. In the last few years, the revolution has spread into other shale plays, from Louisiana and Arkansas to Pennsylvania and New York State, and British Columbia as well. The supply impact has been dramatic. In the lower 48, states thought to be in decline as a natural gas source, production surged an astonishing 15% from the beginning of 2007 to mid-2008. This increase is more than most other countries produce in total. Equally dramatic is the effect on U.S. reserves. Proven reserves have risen to 245 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 2008 from 177 Tcf in 2000, despite having produced nearly 165 Tcf during those years. The recent increase in estimated U.S. gas reserves by the Potential Gas Committee, representing both academic and industry experts, is in itself equivalent to more than half of the total proved reserves of Qatar, the new LNG powerhouse. With more drilling experience, U.S. estimates are likely to rise dramatically in the next few years. At current levels of demand, the U.S. has about 90 years of proven and potential supply—a number that is bound to go up as more and more shale gas is found. To have the resource base suddenly expand by this much is a game changer. But what is getting changed? It transforms the debate over generating electricity. The U.S. electric power industry faces very big questions about fuel choice and what kind of new generating capacity to build. In the face of new climate regulations, the increased availability of gas will likely lead to more natural gas consumption in electric power because of gas's relatively lower CO2 emissions. Natural gas power plants can also be built more quickly than coal-fired plants. Some areas like Pennsylvania and New York, traditionally importers of the bulk of their energy from elsewhere, will instead become energy producers. It could also mean that more buses and truck fleets will be converted to natural gas. Energy-intensive manufacturing companies, which have been moving overseas in search of cheaper energy in order to remain globally competitive, may now stay home. But these industrial users and the utilities with their long investment horizons—both of which have been whipsawed by recurrent cycles of shortage and surplus in natural gas over several decades—are inherently skeptical and will require further confirmation of a sustained shale gale before committing. More abundant gas will have another, not so well recognized effect—facilitating renewable development. Sources like wind and solar are "intermittent." When the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine, something has to pick up the slack, and that something is likely to be natural-gas fired electric generation. This need will become more acute as the mandates for renewable electric power grow. So far only one serious obstacle to development of shale resources across the U.S. has appeared—water. The most visible concern is the fear in some quarters that hydrocarbons or chemicals used in fraccing might flow into aquifers that supply drinking water. However, in most instances, the gas-bearing and water-bearing layers are widely separated by thousands of vertical feet, as well as by rock, with the gas being much deeper. Therefore, the hydraulic fracturing of gas shales is unlikely to contaminate drinking water. The risks of contamination from surface handling of wastes, common to all industrial processes, requires continued care. While fraccing uses a good deal of water, it is actually less water-intensive than many other types of energy production. Unconventional natural gas has already had a global impact. With the U.S. market now oversupplied, and storage filled to the brim, there's been much less room for LNG. As a result more LNG is going into Europe, leading to lower spot prices and talk of modifying long-term contracts. But is unconventional natural gas going to go global? Preliminary estimates suggest that shale gas resources around the world could be equivalent to or even greater than current proven natural gas reserves. Perhaps much greater. But here in the U.S., our independent oil and gas sector, open markets and private ownership of mineral rights facilitated development. Elsewhere development will require negotiations with governments, and potentially complex regulatory processes. Existing long-term contracts, common in much of the natural gas industry outside the U.S., could be another obstacle. Extensive new networks of pipelines and infrastructure will have to be built. And many parts of the world still have ample conventional gas to develop first. Yet interest and activity are picking up smartly outside North America. A shale gas revolution in Europe and Asia would change the competitive dynamics of the globalized gas market, altering economic calculations and international politics. This new innovation will take time to establish its global credentials. The U.S. is really only beginning to grapple with the significance. It may be half a decade before the strength of the unconventional gas revolution outside North America can be properly assessed. But what has begun as the shale gale in the U.S. could end up being an increasingly powerful wind that blows through the world economy. Mr. Yergin, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, & Power" (Free Press, new edition, 2009) is chairman of IHS CERA. Mr. Ineson is senior director of global gas for IHS CERA. Email

After Adam Winter
read about a roving teleconferencing robot, he got a hunch that the $2,000 gadget might become the next big thing. So the 38-year-old technology consultant from Columbus, Ohio, sat down at his computer earlier this month, clicked a button and committed to plunk $10,000 from his bank account into the 18-month-old Silicon Valley startup that developed the robot. Startup companies are finding new ways to promote themselves to potential angel investors via funding websites, but the risks are high. One site that lets startups post profiles warns, "Expect to lose your money." Photo: Double Robotics.
Related Raising Startup Capital From Anywhere, USA Vote and Discuss
Mr. Winter used an investment website called AngelList and its new "Invest" button. "You say how much, hit 'go,' and you're committed," he said. "It's almost as easy as the Amazon one-click checkout." "It's a totally new way of raising startup capital," says David Cann,
co-founder of Double Robotics, the Sunnyvale, Calif., firm in which Mr. Winter invested. About 50 "angels," or individual investors in small businesses and startups, put money into Double Robotics with the Invest button. Neither the 31-year-old Mr. Cann, nor his 28-year-old partner, Marc DeVidts,
have met any of those investors. "Money is money," Mr. Cann says. "We're happy to take it from whomever." AngelList (Angel.co), a networking site for entrepreneurs and investors, has been around a couple of years but previously offered users only the opportunity to create a profile and share information, hoping to raise money in the process. Some critics say it is foolhardy to rely heavily on online research and tools to make startup-investment decisions, without ever meeting or even talking to the entrepreneurs involved. "You're adding a whole layer of risk to an already very risky investment class," says Jeffrey Sohl,
director of the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire. "With most of these investments, you're going to lose money." Enlarge Image

Jason Henry for The Wall Street Journal The AngelList site prominently posts stern caveats, stating bluntly, "Startups are very risky investments. Expect to lose your money." AngelList also warns that it doesn't verify the information posted by startups. It is more than a Wild West, though. The Invest tool on AngelList is powered by New York-based SecondMarket, an investment platform that is licensed as a broker-dealer by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and Securities and Exchange Commission. It allows up to 95 accredited investors—individuals with a net worth of more than $1 million, or with annual income exceeding $200,000 for more than two consecutive years—to commit as little as $1,000 each in a startup. Forming something called a single security fund for each deal, SecondMarket alleviates a startup's need to follow up with each individual investor to collect the money. So far, 11 startups have used the Invest tool. All were handpicked and invited by AngelList and SecondMarket. They wouldn't disclose names or details because of regulatory concerns. Unlike with crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter, people who invest through AngelList get a stake in the startup, although terms vary per company and per deal. On Kickstarter, supporters usually are promised a product or something related to the project they helped to fund. Kickstarter users can contribute a few dollars, whereas AngelList has a minimum of $1,000. Double Robotics turned to AngelList when it was seeking $300,000 as a safeguard to deal with any problems that could come up when the company starts shipping its new device. On the website, Mr. Cann created a profile where he told potential investors that his startup had nearly $2 million of preorders and that he and his co-founder—both engineers—had recently participated in an elite program for entrepreneurs. For now, the AngelList "Invest" tool is free for startups and investors to use while AngelList and SecondMarket figure out a way to monetize it, but many angels are cautious. Catherine Mott,
a retired entrepreneur in Pittsburgh who has been an angel investor since 1999, says she won't back a company until she—or a member of the 65-member local angel group she leads—has spent at least 20 hours of face time with its founders and team. "It's no different than when you go hire someone to work for you," says Ms. Mott, who hasn't invested through AngelList. "You just don't blindly reach into a bag and pull out a résumé and say this is the one I'm going to hire." After spending more than a dozen hours last year with the staff of a tech startup that piqued her group's interest, Ms. Mott says it became clear that the startup team wasn't working together effectively. "One team member didn't know what other was doing," the 57-year-old said. "It gave us great concern." Ms. Mott decided not to invest in the company based largely on her in-person observations. "You can't evaluate group dynamics and a manager's ability from a distance," she says. Brian Cohen, chairman of the New York Angels Group, an angel-investment group with 97 members, says he understands why some investors—those living far from entrepreneurial hubs like Silicon Valley and New York— may be tempted to trust what they read online to make investing decisions. "You get so excited about the possibilities," says Mr. Cohen, whose group hasn't used AngelList's new Invest tool. "Even the best angel investors get caught up in the excitement." Still, he advises angels to do as much research into a potential investment as possible before committing to a deal. "Not doing due diligence is like having unprotected sex," he says. "As you scale up the amount of dollars you put in, you need and want to do more due diligence." Kevin Moore,
43, a former investment banker who owns Applied Practice Ltd., an education-publishing business in Dallas, says new angel investing services on the Web have made it possible for him to invest in startups situated far away, such as in Silicon Valley. Over the past year, he has invested using AngelList-SecondMarket, FundersClub, and MicroVentures. While he's spoken with some of the entrepreneurs whose startups he funded through those platforms, he says he opted to invest in them mostly based on information he found online, including founders' portfolio websites and social-media profiles, coverage of their companies by tech blogs, and comments about their products within the funding sites' discussion forums. He also would conduct research on angels already committed to a startup, if he didn't recognize them, checking their background and domain expertise. Mr. Moore says he previously struggled to get in on deals with "highfliers" whose companies scored funding from "an old boys' network" of New York and Silicon Valley investors. With the new platforms, he is able to get in on these deals, alongside big- name investors, offering smaller amounts than he had to before, and without any special invitation to do so.

President Obama wants more government. In his second inaugural address, he masked the message with phrases like "collective action" and doing "things together." But these were stand-ins—euphemisms, really—for a bigger and more ambitious federal government. That's the unmistakable goal of his second term, and his inaugural address was devoted to his determination to achieve it. Mr. Obama paid lip service to reducing "the size of our deficit." This was followed by a crucial "but" as he went on to defend a series of programs he is unwilling to cut, including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. "These things do not sap our initiative," he declared. "They strengthen us." Related Video

In effect, Mr. Obama endorsed the entire liberal agenda as the guiding star of his next four years in the White House. He reached out to various interest groups in the Democratic coalition—gays, minorities, feminists, the poor, immigrants. But to Republicans, he offered nothing, not even a vague desire to meet them halfway or reach bipartisan agreements on taxes, spending or anything else. So there won't be a "grand bargain" in Mr. Obama's second term. As for the looming debt crisis, the president didn't give it so much as an anxious nod. His mind was on growing government. The speech should debunk two myths about Mr. Obama and his presidency, both trumpeted by liberal commentators and Democratic activists. One is that the president is really a pragmatist and a centrist. Not so. Only an ideologically committed liberal could have delivered the address that Mr. Obama did. The other myth is that Mr. Obama is eager to compromise with Republicans but has faced unprecedented obstructionism on their part. The speech told a different tale. It showed the president bent on pursuing an agenda with few if any sweeteners for Republicans. The highly partisan theme was a departure from recent second inaugural addresses. In 2005, George W. Bush talked about spreading freedom and touched on national unity and healing. In 1997, Bill Clinton called for "a government that is smaller, lives within its means, and does more with less." In 1973, Richard Nixon
emphasized peace. In 1985, Ronald Reagan
advocated "steps to permanently control government's power to tax and spend." (See Notable & Quotable nearby.) If there is a model for Mr. Obama's speech, it is FDR's
famous inaugural address in 1937, when he unabashedly extolled government. "Democratic government has the innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable, to solve problems once considered unsolvable," FDR declared. Mr. Obama was less explicit, but his emphasis was on the virtues of government. Enlarge Image
President Obama after delivering his second inaugural address, Jan. 21.
AP Perhaps we shouldn't have been surprised. For nearly two years, Mr. Obama has been touting government programs (except defense) while criticizing Republicans as morally deficient in their demands for reductions in spending. At a news conference a week ago, he said Republicans "have suspicions about whether government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat or whether we should be spending money on medical research." Indeed, the merits of government and the heartlessness of Republicans were the chief talking points of Mr. Obama's re-election campaign. And while he muffled those themes in his address, he didn't abandon them. "We reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future," he said. Who might those cruel rejectionists be? Mr. Obama's implication was clear—they're Republicans. And "some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science" about global warming, the president said, but "none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms." He didn't identify the anti-science "some," but it's an easy guess whom he had in mind. The day before the inaugural speech, the president's senior political adviser, David Plouffe, laid out Mr. Obama's strategy for defeating Republicans. On CNN, Mr. Plouffe claimed that Republicans in Washington are a "barrier to progress" and "out of the mainstream." He contrasted them with "Republicans in the country who are seeking compromise, seeking balance." There's no empirical basis for this supposed gap in the GOP ranks. But Mr. Obama and his aides would like to create one by driving a wedge between Republicans. The Democrats will first need a better understanding of the opposition: Republicans in Washington are more attuned to compromise than those outside. A hardy perennial of Obama speeches is an expression of wariness about government. "We have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority, nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society's ills can be cured through government alone," he said in his inaugural address. But the speech contradicted this claim, since practically all the solutions it stressed were government ones. Mr. Obama also likes to refer to obsolete programs—"We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time"—without citing any in particular for extinction. And there was another bit of misdirection—a classic Obama rhetorical trick—in the address. "Progress does not compel us to settle the centuries-long debate about the role of government for all time," he said, "but it does require us to act in our time." Practically every word of his second inaugural speech said that Mr. Obama knows precisely what the role of government should be: a big one. Mr. Barnes is the executive editor of the Weekly Standard.
