Mutual Funds vs Proactive Separate Accounts of ETFs- Which Choice?
Which would you choose?
Over 99% of Mutual fund families offer only buy-and-hold and bull-market-only strategies and refuses to sell securities short in a down market, go to cash, or hedge against risks or to suggest that their shareholders should consider doing so during a bear market. Actively-managed funds refuse to actively manage by doing any of those actions.
A separate account is often a brokerage account managed (using a limited power of attorney to trade and deduct management fees) and could easilly be in ETFs which are much lower cost than no-load funds. If the independent registered investment advisor chooses to invest proactively (to search for opportunities globally, attempt to hedge downside risks and/or profit during bear markets and to concentrate in a diversified portfolio of ETFs investing in the hottest sectors and to do all of this on a continuous basis.
Which is the better model for 401(k)s, retirement savings and the general public? I'd like your opinons.

The second question asked about ETFs is "How do they effect traditional mutual funds?"
My answer is, "If the value of a 'professionally-managed' investment fund is to earn positive and compeitive returns, you need to understand that is not what traditional mutual funds do." Mutual fund prospectuses are designed to be sold and not bought. To sell mutual funds it is considered good form to describe them accuarately, not manage them well. Most advisors who sell mutual funds sell them based on YOUR understanding of investments.
A good example is the absurd practice of selling "large-cap growth funds." First, they ignore the reality that many formerly large-cap stocks are now mid-cap stocks and second that a growth stock is hard to find these days. Growth companies are companies with growing sales and profits. That describes very few companies these days. Investing in "styel-box" stock funds (like "large-cap growth" has been demonstrated to cost investors about 2.0 to 2.5 percentage points lower returns each year, as much as 6 percentage points in international funds.
Traditional funds are bad for your investment hearth and experienced advisors to build portfolios of ETFs that can actually deloiver higher, safer returns are hard to find. Don't let the traditional fund industry shout down growth.

An old topic, but I'm in the midst of trying to reposition my meager retirement investments as the market comes back to life and am pretty much a novice investor, so this is a timely question for me. I am seeking to shift my investments to focus on sustainable energy and China/India as long term future winners, ideally together (eg: Asian sustainable energy sector.) I have to date held only mutual finds, and then based on some advisor's pick 15 years ago based on my desire for "growth". Well, they didn't grow and I didn't pay attention so I'm now pretty sceptical that a Mutual fund that claims to be a "growth" fund actually grows anything but fees.Mutual funds also seem to be few and far between that deal with sustainable energy (eg: no oil or oil related techonologies) and none focus on that sector in Asia. Many also eschew nuclear or focus on "low carbon" out of some misguided "save the planet" ideas which I find to be long term losing strategies.So, to bring all that to topic; to me, ETFs seem like the way to go for me, but can I use ETFs as vehicles for converting Mutual Fund IRAs (simple and ROTH?) (Obviously, my tax accountant should advise, but thought I'd get an opinion from here as well)

My first 'tax advantaged' investment was in an 'IRA' type account. For many years, it was beneficial. Any small maneuvers or repositioning in my account that were made had the benefit of not concerning myself with any long term or short term gains. When the ROTH IRA became the latest and greatest, it took me years to even recognize that there were advantages to switching over from the traditional IRA. I have accumulated a wonderful retirement from contributions to my IRA and am reluctant to start chopping it up and reallocating to a different type of account. If anything, my long term goal is to review my mutual fund and individual holdings and perhaps consider ETF's that track emerging and developing regions. I have observed that overseas markets will do better in the short run, but if I remember correctly, all the runups were squandered several years ago, when the overseas markets (ALSO) collapsed under the weight of poor fiscal policies and decisions relating to inverstors' stock selections. I review daily the best returns from ETF LISTS from ONE DAY, 3 MONTH, and ANNUAL returns. I have found that the Leveraged ETF's provide the best return, percentage wise, if one can stomach the roller coaster like peaks and valleys. Despite the warnings that come with each Leveraged ETF issue, how is it possible that EDC, DPK, UPRO, et. al. advising that these are one day ONLY investments, but regularly come out on top in the above listed time frame(s)? I feel as if I have been shredded and discarded by the mutual fund company's stated advertised goals of obtaining the best return versus their 'BENCHMARK.' When I note the high fees associated with Mutual Funds investments, ETF investing makes the decisions even easier. Additionally, after the 2008 debacle of wall street and watching people's hard earned money disappear, it provided me with renewed energy and strength to proceed to put into effect what years of reading about and learning from the markets have taught; "...no one cares as much about my money than I do...."
Finally, I have resisted the tempation to list the stocks, ETF's, and mutual funds that currently hold my IRA's. After all, my recommendations would be disappointing. They include neither exotic or hard to understand strategies and would be of little or no benefit to person's reading it. The strategy employed nothing more that reviewing how frequently each STOCK belonged to INSTITUTIONAL BUYERS. It's perhaps of little advantage, but I am at least somewhat secure of making selections based on one consistent model. As far as selecting ETF's, I have read that by selecting the top two (2) holdings of the fund I am reviewing for purchase will (perhaps) provide some insight into the benefit of purchasing the ETF, itself. As a new thread to this post, I am looking forward to browsing the other members comments of their experiences both positive and negative. Thanks!

A Bangladesh court sentenced an opposition Islamist leader and 13 others to death on Thursday in connection with an arms-smuggling case a decade ago. A special tribunal in the port city of Chittagong imposed the death penalty on Matiur Rahman Nizami, the head of the Jamaat-e-Islami party. The court also convicted Lutfozzaman Babar, a leader of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which is allied with Jamaat. The...

A drilling rig in Susquehanna County, Pa. Tapping the country's plentiful natural gas reserves requires drilling wells in rural communities and suburban neighborhoods previously untouched by energy production.
Redux Pictures America's abundance of natural gas is often described as a boon to national security and a "bridge" to a clean, low-carbon energy economy. It is an exciting future, but we are not there yet. The rush to develop the nation's abundant natural-gas reserves is trampling the environment and needlessly risking the health of communities in which gas development occurs. More needs to be done to ensure that the carbon benefits ascribed to natural gas are real and sustained. It is long past time to require energy producers to fully disclose the chemicals used in the fluids for fracturing shale. Citizens are justifiably concerned about these industrial materials, which are being used in proximity to their homes and water supplies. Producers insist that their chemical cocktails are safe, but their claims cannot be verified because the industry withholds that information. People get the distinct impression that the industry has something to hide. Read More Stepping on the Gas Building trust is crucial, and it begins with transparency. Tapping our nation's plentiful natural-gas reserves requires drilling wells in rural communities and suburban neighborhoods previously untouched by energy production. People are anxious about having a large, new industrial activity right next door. They expect natural gas producers to do the right thing. Requiring producers to disclose the chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluid should be a no-brainer. For all the attention given to technologies like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, some of the greatest gains to be made in reducing the environmental risks of natural-gas production come from simple things like the proper pouring of cement well casings and the proper handling of chemicals and wastewater, so that they do not spill or seep into streams or water supplies. Avoiding spills is not rocket science. Properly constructing and operating wells is a highly technical enterprise, but most natural-gas producers know how to do it. Too many are simply failing to achieve consistently good performance. “
Requiring producers to disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing should be a no-brainer. ”
Better regulations are needed on things like well construction and wastewater management, particularly in states without a recent history of natural gas production. With that in mind, the Environmental Defense Fund, Southwestern Energy and other progressive gas producers and environmental groups are working to develop a model regulatory framework for safe drilling that can serve as the foundation for better operations. Equally important, regulatory agencies will need greater resources for the timely and thorough review of permit applications, as well as for robust enforcement. Still, environmentally sound natural gas production will never exist until producers themselves get serious about environmental management. Natural-gas production takes place at thousands of wells spread over many hundreds of miles in a given state. Even under the best of circumstances, there will not be enough inspectors to oversee them all. Each company must operate with the understanding that its reputation, and the reputation of the industry as a whole, is only as good as the last well completed. If natural gas is to be a near-term solution for a clean energy future, the industry also must be much more rigorous in measuring, publicly reporting and fixing leaks in the production and distribution process. Natural gas is a potent greenhouse gas, so leaks can undermine much of the low-carbon benefits that come from using it to replace fuels like coal and oil. Preventing leaks also cuts back on other air pollutants associated with gas production and use, including such volatile organic compounds as ethane and butane. Cost-effective solutions for minimizing leaks exist. Many of these technologies have relatively quick paybacks. And the benefits work both ways: They can both reduce emissions and increase the bottom line of producers. —Mr. Brownstein is chief counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund's Energy Program. Email

Boeing's Flying Laptop Needs a Reboot
Oh, the humanity. But at least the company's goal was to make air travel nicer.
By
Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.
Jan. 18, 2013 7:23 p.m. ET
An Aviation Week blogger said it most precisely: The Federal Aviation Administration is requiring fixes to be made to the Dreamliner's battery system before Boeing's state-of-the-art jet will be allowed to fly again. The only problem is that neither the FAA nor Boeing has identified a problem or a way of fixing it. A thought went through every head when the plane's troubles first popped up: At least it's not the fuselage. The Dreamliner's signature innovation was to replace aluminum with stronger, lighter carbon fiber....

Mark Teixeira had to pull out of the World Baseball Classic with a right wrist injury.
Associated Press TAMPA, Fla.—The Yankees need to consult a voodoo priest, conduct a seance, get their palms read. Something, anything, to change their karma. Hardly a day goes by this spring without something unfortunate befalling this team. The Yankees are old, the oldest team in baseball, so they expect more than their share of injuries—but this is getting ridiculous. The latest blow came Tuesday. First baseman Mark Teixeira, away with Team USA at the World Baseball Classic, injured his right wrist taking swings during batting practice. He is dropping out of the tournament. "I was kind of shocked," said Yankees manager Joe Girardi, who said Teixeira had had no problems with the wrist. Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman said Tuesday night that Teixeira, 32, had felt a pop in his wrist while swinging, and an MRI showed a strain. He is shut down for a minimum of two weeks, but Cashman fears it could drag on far longer. "I'm concerned about it, to be honest," Cashman said. "This could be something where, even if it plays out as not serious, it could play out longer than anybody would want." Bad news is becoming de rigeur here at Steinbrenner Field in what is fast becoming a nightmare spring training. Center fielder Curtis Granderson was hit by a pitch and broke his forearm in his first at-bat of the spring. Pitcher Phil Hughes is shut down with back problems; it is unclear whether he will be ready to start the season. Reliever Boone Logan is having elbow issues and hasn't pitched yet this spring. That is to say nothing of Alex Rodriguez, who is off rehabbing his surgically repaired hip, and the uncertain status of Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera, neither of whom has yet appeared in a game. And it isn't just the players who are living under a dark cloud. Cashman has gotten the worst of it so far, fracturing his fibula and dislocating his right ankle skydiving for charity Monday. The only Yankee who has had a little good luck—if you can call it that—is Ichiro Suzuki, who totaled his Land Rover over the weekend in a two-car crash and walked away unscathed, despite the air bags deploying. "I guess you can say that you're going to have to do a lot worse to have me get hurt," a defiant Ichiro said through an interpreter. Teixeira wasn't so lucky. Initial reports on his wrist are promising, but that is what the Yankees thought with Granderson at first. Further exams discovered a break. Girardi, perpetually even-keeled, said that he is used to injuries and other problems piling up, and that this latest spate of troubles isn't dimming his optimism whatsoever. "No, it's not," Girardi said. "This is a club that I've seen go through this, most of the time that I've been here. We went through some injuries here and there and our guys have found a way, and I really believe they'll do that. Even if we have to do it a different way, we'll find a way." But if Teixeira is out for an extended period, the options for replacing him aren't terribly appetizing. "We have a number of guys who have played there," Girardi said of first base. "Juan Rivera has played there; Dan Johnson has played there; [Kevin Youkilis] has played there and you could put someone else at third." But Juan Rivera is already in the competition to replace Granderson in the outfield, and is no savior there or at first base. Johnson is known for two pennant-race pinch-hit home runs—and not much else. Moving Youkilis leaves a gaping hole at third base. Then there is the hole that losing Teixeira would leave in the lineup. Before Granderson's injury, the Yankees were already admitting they lacked the power of years past. Then Granderson and his 43 homers were stripped from the lineup until at least May. Now Teixeira and his 30-homer power are in jeopardy. No, there is little the Yankees can do from a baseball standpoint if things keep going wrong. They may have to cross their fingers and hope for the best. And if that fails, ask the Ouija board. Email

Though their recent performance has been less than stellar, the number of "tactical allocation" mutual funds is expanding. Managers of such funds generally have leeway to shift their asset mix, with the goal of exploiting the stock market's strong points and dodging its weaker corners over time. There are 41 mutual funds with...
