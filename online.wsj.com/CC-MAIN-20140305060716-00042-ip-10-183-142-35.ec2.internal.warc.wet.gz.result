PRAGUE—The Palestinian ambassador to the Czech Republic died after an explosion on Wednesday at his residence that local and Palestinian authorities describe as an accident, not an attack. The explosion occurred when Jamal al-Jamal, the 56-year-old diplomat, manipulated an old office safe deposit box, police spokeswoman Andrea Zoulova said....

's board voted to oust Mark Hurd
Aug. 6 after the chief executive reached a sexual-harassment-claim settlement that directors thought impeded their probe of the claim, according to a person familiar with the board's thinking. H-P's board decided to oust Mark Hurd after the chief executive reached a settlement on a sexual-harassment claim that directors thought impeded their probe of the claim. Joann Lublin discusses. Also, Nick Timiraos discusses what to expect at Tuesday's summit meant to address some of the problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The settlement between Mr. Hurd and Jodie Fisher,
a former marketing contractor for H-P, was reached on the evening of Aug. 4 without the board's input or knowledge, this person said. It scuttled a mediation session set for the next day at which Ms. Fisher and her lawyer were to meet with H-P's outside counsel and Mr. Hurd's personal lawyer, people familiar with the matter said. The effect was to short-circuit the board's investigation and increase mistrust among directors who already felt Mr. Hurd hadn't been fully cooperating with the internal probe, said the person familiar with the board's thinking. Mark Hurd's Tenure

More photos and interactive graphics The account of thinking at the board—which has faced criticism to the effect that it rushed to judgment and that the ouster wasn't warranted—contrasts with an account given by someone familiar with Mr. Hurd's thinking. This person stated that for more than three weeks before the settlement, H-P repeatedly had instructed Mr. Hurd's lawyers to settle with Ms. Fisher before the mediation session. Mr. Hurd provided everything the board requested for the investigation, this person said, adding that H-P didn't allow Mr. Hurd to address the board or to respond directly to questions from board members. On this point again, accounts differ. The person familiar with the board's thinking said a board member encouraged Mr. Hurd to speak to the board but he declined; the person familiar with Mr. Hurd's thinking disputed that account. According to the person familiar with the board's thinking, before the Hurd-Fisher settlement, H-P had seen enough evidence of misconduct by Mr. Hurd for there to be a sense among directors that he was no longer fit to serve as CEO. The alleged misconduct was said to include failing to disclose a personal relationship with an H-P contractor—something H-P defines as a conflict of interest—and filing expense reports the company determined were intended to conceal the relationship. Jodie Fisher Getty Images A person close to Mr. Hurd said that he didn't conceal a relationship, he didn't fill out expense accounts himself, and Ms. Fisher's name was on some of them. The canceled mediation session "weighed in" on the board's ultimate decision, a different person familiar with the matter said, "but it was not [the only] issue." H-P board members learned of the settlement with Ms. Fisher on Aug. 5. H-P announced Mr. Hurd's departure the next afternoon, sending reverberations through the tech world and H-P's stock tumbling. H-P cited violations of its code of business conduct, including inaccurate expense reports. Enlarge Image
Mark Hurd's surprise settlement of a harassment claim contributed to his ouster.
Associated Press More H-P Ouster a 'Teachable Moment' The board has since faced a backlash, including a shareholder suit. Critics have taken issue with the decisions to allow Mr. Hurd to leave and to give him an exit package possibly worth more than $35 million, with some saying expense-account problems don't warrant an ouster. It remains unclear exactly what Ms. Fisher alleged. Mr. Hurd has said through a representative there was no improper relationship. Ms. Fisher has said they didn't have "an intimate sexual relationship." H-P's board launched a probe of Ms. Fisher's claim after she sent a letter to Mr. Hurd, received June 29. At first, the board accepted his assurance the claim was meritless. As the investigation evolved, said a person close to it, the board came to believe that the CEO had a personal relationship with Ms. Fisher, even if not sexual. For instance, the investigation found that Mr. Hurd had looked at clips from racy films featuring Ms. Fisher, a former actress, this person said. Someone familiar with Mr. Hurd's thinking said he just did a Google search of 10 minutes or so. On Sunday, Ms. Fisher's lawyer, Gloria Allred,
declined to comment and said Ms. Fisher wouldn't, either. H-P recruited Mr. Hurd in March 2005 to be CEO after dismissing then-CEO Carly Fiorina, based on his success running NCR Corp., where under his leadership profits for 2004 soared. Mr. Hurd is on the board of News Corp.,

which owns Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Ms. Fisher, now age 50, was hired by Mr. Hurd's office in 2007 to work as a greeter at H-P customer events. She and Mr. Hurd were introduced in August 2007 at a Los Angeles hotel by Caprice Fimbres McIlvaine,
who was known at H-P as Mr. Hurd's chief of staff, someone familiar with the matter said. Mr. Hurd was en route home from San Diego and found time to meet Ms. Fisher because another meeting was canceled, a different person says. In September, Ms. Fimbres McIlvaine arranged for Ms. Fisher to fly to Denver for a second interview. Ms. Fisher and Mr. Hurd dined together and stayed at the same hotel with other H-P staff, people familiar with the matter say. Ms. Fimbres McIlvaine, who resigned last week, didn't respond to a request for comment Sunday. Ms. Fisher's job was to make sure Mr. Hurd spent time with CEOs of the larger customers at events. She worked a dozen or so such events, paid $1,000 to $5,000 each. The last was in late 2009. Ms. Fisher moved back to New Jersey and began work at her family's staffing company. After Mr. Hurd received a letter from Ms. Fisher with her sexual-harassment claims, within 30 minutes of reading it he handed it to H-P's general counsel, Michael Holston,
who soon started notifying directors. Mr. Hurd said there had been no sexual affair "and this was something that could be negotiated and it would go away," said a a person familiar with the matter. "Initially, he didn't see the need for any disclosure." Board members preferred full disclosure, this person added, believing the allegations "would come out eventually, and in retrospect, the board and Mark would look like they didn't do their jobs right." Sometime in July, Mr. Hurd told investigators he'd had a personal relationship with Ms. Fisher, though not sexual, said a person familiar with the matter. As late as the end of July, Mr. Hurd was convinced he could remain an effective CEO, another person added. Shortly before the scheduled Aug. 5 mediation, Mr. Hurd began negotiations with Ms. Allred to settle the claim, according to a person familiar with the matter. Neither Mr. Hurd nor his lawyer told H-P of the plan to settle, said a person close to the situation. A person close to Mr. Hurd said H-P knew of the negotiations. Lawyers for Mr. Hurd raced to reach a settlement, agreeing to terms Aug. 4. Details of it couldn't be learned. Ms. Fisher then wrote a second letter, absolving H-P of any responsibility, a person familiar with the situation said. She signed a confidentiality agreement barring discussion of the deal. Without Ms. Fisher's cooperation, the mediation session was moot and was canceled. For the board, the developments confirmed feelings of mistrust, said the person familiar with the board's thinking. "Mark had unanimous support going into this," the person said. "The board was keenly interested in keeping him." But this person added that by the time of the planned mediation, the board, based on what the investigation was finding, had concluded it needed to disclose the accusation of harassment. Now, whatever trust remained was gone, said this person—even though, given the settlement, the board had no choice but to find that Mr. Hurd hadn't violated H-P's sexual-harassment policy. "It wasn't a matter of the allegations themselves," this person said. "The board didn't know what other evidence might exist because it never got to see it." The board spent the next 24 hours tying up loose ends. Those included unanimously voting out the CEO. The board wanted to avoid drawing the situation out any longer, and they negotiated a severance package. —Alexandra Berzon, Don Clark and James Oberman contributed to this article.

Updated April 17, 2013 10:23 p.m. ET
Robinson Cano showed up for work at 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, and, before he could even put on his navy baseball undershirt, his corner of the Yankees' clubhouse became the loudest—and happiest—in the room. Soon, one teammate wandered over to visit, then two, then three. Enlarge Image
Robinson Cano watches his three-run homer Tuesday.
Getty Images Cano is undeniably hot, with 13 hits in 26 at-bats before going 0 for 4 in the Yankees' 4-3 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks Wednesday night. After losing four of their first five games, the Yankees won six of seven, even though their roster has been ravaged by injuries to their top players. The phrase that seems to have become popular among the healthy players is "holding down the fort," and Cano is the primary fort-holder. But that is not necessarily by design. "I don't put into my mind any pressure that I have to do so much," he cheerfully explained. More Teixeira Takes Swings, Pleased With Recovery He says he hasn't changed a single aspect of his game. He hit four home runs through the Yankees' first 12 games, including a three-run shot Tuesday, but he isn't swinging for the fences because Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira are hurt. "I'm not missing my pitch," he said, shrugging his shoulders. He is also continuing to have fun, because baseball would not be the same if he had to labor at it. Sometimes, Yankees manager Joe Girardi
said, Cano is so "relaxed" that it appears to outsiders as if he is nonchalant. But Cano thrives this way. And now the Yankees are taking his lead. "I've known Cano since '05 or '06, when I first signed with the Yankees, and I can tell you, I have never seen Cano mad," Ivan Nova, the winning pitcher Tuesday, said before batting practice Wednesday. Cano, 30, is in the final year of his contract. He fired Scott Boras as his agent earlier this month to join a new partnership between the rapper and entertainment mogul Jay-Z and leading agency CAA. The switch drew a ton of publicity. No matter who his agent is, Cano is about to sign a contract containing many commas and zeros. "I don't think Robby doesn't really worry a whole lot about it," Girardi said Tuesday. "I think Robby knows he's a good player. Robby goes out and works very hard, it's true, and he doesn't take for granted that he's a good player. [But] he understands the contract is going to take care of itself." To fill the spots temporarily left vacant by Rodriguez, Teixeira, Derek Jeter and Curtis Granderson, the Yankees patched together a roster with veterans such as Vernon Wells, Travis Hafner, Lyle Overbay, Ben Francisco and Kevin Youkilis. Cano says he can depend on them. "We got guys who have been playing a long time—guys who we know are going to help us win games," Cano said. The newcomers already knew Cano was pretty good. But they have also discovered something else about him. "He's a guy who's always happy. He has fun playing the game," Hafner said. "He's a tremendous competitor, and his top priority is still winning, but when you're at the park, it's such a long season, and you've got to have fun, and having somebody like him is part of that. "I think the chemistry on this team is great for a lot of guys, and he's one of the big reasons why," Hafner said. The Yankees moved Cano's locker last year to a more prominent position in the clubhouse, away from a pillar on the side of the room to the spot previously occupied by Jorge Posada, the admired catcher. Now the lockers of Cano and Jeter are at the head of the room, flanking the entry to the showers and an inner sanctum that is off-limits to reporters. But Cano is often seated at his locker, autographing memorabilia as he shoots the breeze with anyone who wanders past. Nova visited Wednesday to grip Cano's bat. Spanish, and laughter, flowed freely. But it would have been that way if the Yankees were under .500. "He's always happy, always enjoying the game," shortstop Eduardo Nunez, Cano's neighbor, said with a smile. "He's serious, but you have to enjoy it, too." Then Nunez said, "We're not thinking about the guys we lost. We think we can do this job." Write to at @wsj.com Email

Employers added fewer jobs in March than in any month in almost a year, a dark cloud after several months of slowly improving conditions in labor markets. Just 88,000 jobs were created last month, far below February's 268,000 gain. The unemployment rate, derived from a separate survey, dropped to a four-year low of 7.6%. But the decline was prompted by nearly a half-million workers leaving the job market, not job growth. There's no way to sugarcoat it: This was a lousy March employment report. Ben Casselman discusses takeaways from the jobs data. Photo: AP.
Friday's report from the Labor Department pushed investors out of stocks and into safer alternatives. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 172 points minutes after the report was released, but erased most of its losses to finish down 40.86 points, or 0.28%, to 14565.25. Demand for the perceived safety of U.S. Treasury bonds was strong, however, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down to 1.698%, its lowest this year. The report is likely to mute talk—which had grown louder recently—that the Federal Reserve might move to curtail the pace of its bond buying, which is aimed at lowering long-term interest rates in an effort to spur spending, investment and hiring. Fed officials have said they would buy long-term Treasury and mortgage bonds until the job-market outlook has improved substantially. One Fed official this week raised the possibility of a job market strong enough by summer for the central bank to begin pulling back from the program. But the March picture could raise doubts inside the Fed about how quickly the job market is healing and deflate that possibility. The March reading stirred some fears of yet another "springtime swoon" for the labor market. In recent years, hiring has started the year strong, only to wilt as the weather warmed. Friday's report underscored this point, as the government revised up its estimates for January and February by a combined 61,000 jobs. Even with those revisions, however, job growth started 2013 weaker than in the same period a year ago, suggesting the pace of hiring was trending down before March. The jobs numbers reflect "a very sharp slowdown," said Paul Ashworth,
chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. But, he added, the weak growth may be a more accurate reflection of the fragile recovery than the "surprisingly good" employment numbers notched in January and February. The Nonfarm Payrolls Report
Friday's jobs report shows that talk of an early end to the Federal Reserve's bond-buying programs might have been premature. The Journal's Jon Hilsenrath has more on what the jobs report means for the Fed.

Labor-market indicators tend to lag behind the broader economy. The big job gains of early 2013 were notable, coming on the heels of the meager 0.4% annualized growth in gross domestic product for the final quarter of 2012. Some economists considered that year-end weakness at odds with the strong jobs numbers registered early in 2013. March's report may represent something of a payback for the gains of the past two months. January and February's job-market progress came despite headwinds for consumers and businesses, such as higher payroll taxes. "It seemed very strange that for the first couple of months of the year we had seen no impact" from those forces on the jobs market, Mr. Ashworth said. In the past week, softness began to creep into some indicators, with manufacturing and services activity both slowing their pace of growth. A Historical View U.S. unemployment since 1948

Analysts cautioned against reading too much into numbers that reflect only one month's performance and will be revised. They also cited possible factors behind March's stumble, such as budget turmoil in Washington and unseasonably cold weather in parts of the country. The snapshot was the first jobs report after the $85 billion in sweeping federal budget cuts, known as the sequester, that were triggered early last month. Economists said the sequester's effect is likely to ripple through the recovery in the second and third quarters. The specter of that fallout may have damped some hiring in March. "Job creation clearly sputtered in March," said Eric Lascelles,
chief economist for RBC Global Asset Management in Toronto. "I chalk some of it up to trepidation over the sequester." Enlarge Image
Silver linings in the details were scant, beyond higher estimates for January and February's tallies. Employers took on 20,000 temporary workers in March, often seen as a hiring bellwether. The construction sector added 18,000 jobs, reflecting the housing market's healing, but well below the nearly 50,000 added the month before. Governments shed 7,000 jobs in March. The decline in the unemployment rate resulted not from more people getting jobs but rather from almost 500,000 individuals leaving the workforce, because of layoffs as well as retirement and other reasons. The labor-force participation rate, which measures those employed as well as those looking for work as a portion of the population, fell 0.2 percentage points to a seasonally adjusted 63.3%, a level last seen in mid-1979. Among the sectors that lost jobs was transportation, with truck transportation shedding almost 7,000 positions in March. Tennant Truck Lines Inc. of Colona, Ill., saw business "flatten out in the fourth quarter of 2012…after about 15 months of month-over-month growth," said Aaron Tennant,
chief executive of the family-owned company. Enlarge Image
The company, which hauls agricultural and construction equipment as well as construction materials, still is hiring, Mr. Tennant said, despite the pause in business. That's because "long-distance truck drivers are incredibly hard to come by." Recruiting is our biggest challenge, and then retaining them once we have them." He plans to add between 30 and 35 jobs this year to his workforce of 225. His company, which has been in business since 1946, is feeling both the benefits and costs of the housing recovery. The rise in housing starts since the market bottomed last year "means more demand for construction equipment and steel and lumber and other materials that we haul," Mr. Tennant said. But it also means losing some of his drivers to the construction industry. "Truck drivers hauling my freight can be gone from their families for a week," Mr. Tennant said. "They can walk out of my industry and into construction and walk into a job where they're home every night." The housing market's gains have yet to reach some commercial contractors. Richard Duncan,
who founded a project-management firm 11 years ago, said business in the first quarter has been "kind of a surprising flat line for us." His 15-person company, Rich Duncan
Construction, handles about 50 projects a year such as renovating offices, building restaurants or doing seismic upgrades on airport towers. The Salem, Ore., firm usually is juggling almost a dozen projects, Mr. Duncan said, but that pace has slowed to fewer than 10 because clients' "hesitancy" about the economy has put expansion on the back burner. The slower pace means more of Mr. Duncan's employees are doing hands-on work at job sites, instead of acting as general contractors and managing electricians, plumbers and other subcontractors. "When we're hiring, we're hiring someone who is already trained and can step into a fast-paced situation. There's a real lack of qualified applicants at that level," Mr. Duncan said. "If we did let somebody go, the chances of us pulling somebody back in at the level we need them at, it's too risky." —Jon Hilsenrath, Ben Casselman and Jonathan Cheng contributed to this article.

Tim Wilson From today's Wall Street Journal Europe.
Updated July 15, 2009 12:01 a.m. ET
GENEVA -- World leaders are talking a lot about climate change, not least in their flashy statement on controlling global temperatures at the recent Group of Eight summit in Italy. One of the smarter ways they can put this determination into effect will be to protect the intellectual property of green innovators from a growing onslaught by developing-world politicians and mistaken activists. Intellectual property rights are the underappreciated link in the environmentalist chain. By rewarding inventors and entrepreneurs, well-enforced patents provide the right incentives for the innovation that will produce technologies necessary to manage climate change. Yet this fact is getting lost. Access to low carbon technologies has become a central issue in international climate change negotiations as rich countries put more pressure on the poor to cut their emissions. Understandably the poor aren't prepared to do so unless they are given cheap access to technologies. Patents are increasingly viewed as the main obstacle to cheap technology transfer. So a representative of the Brazilian government, Haroldo Machado Filho, this week told a World Intellectual Property Organization conference in Geneva that leaders should consider the possibility of allowing "compulsory licensing" for green technologies. This would be a new loophole in international intellectual property rules that would allow developing-country governments to break patents "for the public good"; such a loophole already exists for pharmaceuticals. In a similar vein, Indian Climate Change Minister Shri Ramesh asserted late last month that access to intellectual property for low-carbon technology is a "global public good." This kind of thinking lays the intellectual groundwork for patent violations down the road. Most worrying, opponents of patents have succeeded in having included in the current negotiating text for a post-Kyoto agreement paragraphs to undermine patents. The final text won't be finalized until at least the December U.N. Copenhagen meeting, but current proposals range from "compulsory licensing" to the "creation of a global technology pool for climate change" that would socialize intellectual property. These proposals fundamentally misunderstand why low-carbon technology is expensive. A January report by Copenhagen Economics, a consulting firm, found that the high prices are most likely a result of the immaturity of technologies, not patents. New technologies are generally more expensive when there are fewer products competing in the market. As more technologies are innovated the price is likely to drop. Most promising green technologies are so new they simply haven't had time to decline in price yet. The Copenhagen Economics report also notes that weakening intellectual property for green technologies would be bad for the developing world countries whose governments advocate such measures. A growing number of patents on these technologies are held by developing-country innovators. China is one of the largest owners of solar and fuel-cell technology patents. The balance is still in favor of developed-world innovators, but the gap is narrowing fast. Allowing entrepreneurs in poorer countries to profit from their discoveries will be good both for the environment and for developing-country economies. Undermining patents won't help access to technologies, but it will stop the next generation of technologies being invented, and with it a long-term solution to achieving the twin goals of developing countries to reduce emissions and alleviate poverty. Rather than breaking patents, policy makers could re-evaluate tariff regimes and other barriers that can add up to 165% to the cost of some imported green technologies, according to a 2007 World Bank study. The best path to a green future is not to break free-market principles, but to return to them. Mr. Wilson is director of the Institute of Public Affairs in Melbourne, Australia. Email
