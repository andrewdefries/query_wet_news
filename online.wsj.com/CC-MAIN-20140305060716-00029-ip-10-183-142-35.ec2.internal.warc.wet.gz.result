Governos não se entendem e fusão de BAE e Eads fracassa

Da Redação doThe Wall Street JournalAs companhias aeroespaciais e de defesa BAE Systems PLC e European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. desistiram de sua planejada fusão depois que Reino Unido, França e Alemanha não conseguiram chegar a um acordo sobre quanta influência os países deveriam ter na empresa combinada. A decisão de ontem encerrou vários meses de negociações cada vez mais frenéticas das empresas para criar o maior grupo de defesa do mundo em vendas.
Reuters
Caça Eurofighter Typhoon, da britânica BAE Systems, durante salão de aviação de Paris, no ano passado.
A Eads, dona da fabricante de aviões Airbus, e a BAE puseram a culpa nos políticos pela derrocada do acordo, apontando em particular para a intransigência de Berlim, o que levanta novas questões sobre a capacidade dos governos da Europa de colocar de lado interesses nacionais em projetos conjuntos. O desfecho também representou um fracasso pessoal para os diretores-presidentes das companhias, Tom Enders, da Eads, e Ian King ,da BAE Systems, que lutaram com afinco pelo negócio. King ficou especialmente sob pressão de alguns de seus acionistas que achavam que a fusão com a Eads ia de encontro aos interesses do grupo britânico.
"Ficou claro que os interesses dos acionistas governamentais não podem ser propriamente conciliados entre si e com os objetivos que a BAE Systems e a Eads estabeleceram para a fusão", afirmaram as companhias num comunicado conjunto. "Nós não pudemos chegar a um acordo com os dois governos europeus sobre os nossos limites de segurança. É correto dizer que a Alemanha foi o principal ponto de conflito", disse King.
O presidente da França, François Hollande, assumiu uma posição neutra em relação ao colapso da fusão. "Não cabe a nós lamentar ou comemorar", disse Hollande numa entrevista coletiva em Paris. "Eu noto simplesmente que houve discussões entre essas empresas. A França apresentou um certo número de argumentos e condições, nossos colegas alemães colocaram um critério, os britânicos fizeram o mesmo, e as companhias tiraram suas conclusões."
A França e a Espanha são acionistas da Eads, com 15% e 5,5% de participação, respectivamente. A Alemanha não tem participação direta na Eads, mas a montadora alemã Daimler AG tem 15% e já estava vendendo grande parte disso a um banco estatal alemão. A fusão teria criado uma empresa com uma receita anual combinada de mais de US$ 90 bilhões e um valor de mercado de quase US$ 50 bilhões em 12 de setembro, quando o negócio foi anunciado. Os acionistas da Eads ficariam com 60% e os da BAE com o restante. As empresas pretendiam listar a nova entidade nas bolsas de Londres e Amsterdã. Embora algum progresso havia sido feito nas conversas entre Reino Unido, França e Alemanha na terça-feira, os governos foram incapazes de chegar a um acordo final sobre as participações de cada país, a composição do conselho e a localização da sede da empresa.
As reações dos investidores e analistas foram conflitantes e a ação da Eads recuperou parte do que perdeu desde que a notícia da fusão foi divulgada, enquanto a ação da BAE caiu. Desde o anúncio dos planos de fusão, o mercado havia demonstrado ceticismo quanto ao negócio derrubando as ações de ambas as empresas. "Um dia triste para a defesa europeia", escreveu Robert Stallard, analista do RBC Capital Markets, num relatório de análise. "Nós sempre acreditamos que esse negócio era benéfico para o setor de defesa da Europa, que continua relativamente fragmentado e com um orçamento significativamente menor que o dos Estados Unidos." Um porta-voz da Invesco Perpetual, uma unidade da Invesco Ltd., que é a maior acionista da BAE Systems com uma participação de 13,3%, aplaudiu o fracasso da fusão, depois de a empresa ter declarado na semana passada que o acordo colocaria em risco a capacidade da BAE de obter contratos de defesa nos EUA. King e Enders disseram que suas companhias têm um futuro promissor como entidades independentes. A BAE é "forte e robusta financeiramente", disse King.
"A Eads vai continuar no seu caminho de crescimento internacional e nossos acionistas podem continuar esperando crescimento lucrativo, excelente liquidez e execução de programas baseados numa forte carteira de encomendas", disse Enders. A Eads foi apoiada publicamente pelo presidente francês. "Eu tenho confiança na Eads, que é muito bem-sucedida e gera emprego", disse Hollande.
O governo da Alemanha afirmou que resolver um impasse de longa data sobre a participação alemã na Eads é agora uma prioridade. "Para o governo federal, é agora prioritário que a Eads continue a se desenvolver positivamente em todas as áreas de negócios", disse num comunicado o porta-voz do governo alemão Steffen Seibert. "Para garantir isso, o governo vai, entre outras coisas, continuar negociações sobre a aquisição de ações em poder da Daimler através do KfW." O KfW é um banco estatal de desenvolvimento que o governo geralmente usa para cuidar das suas participações. A proposta de fusão, que foi negociada durante três meses, morreu num telefonema de três minutos.
Na terça-feira à noite, depois de dias de intenso debate entre representantes de governos e executivos, a chanceler alemã Angela Merkel ligou para Hollande. Ela lhe disse que a Alemanha acreditava que o negócio tinha mais aspectos negativos do que positivos para seu país, e que ela não o iria apoiar, segundo várias pessoas a par da conversa.
"Nós tivemos a oportunidade de testar uma estratégia bastante audaciosa", disse ao The Wall Street Journal Dick Olver, presidente do conselho da BAE, depois do anúncio do fim das negociações.
A resistência da Alemanha, em particular, surpreendeu muitas pessoas envolvidas porque as companhias acreditavam que tinham um plano que faria da Eads, que é controlada por governos, uma companhia mais convencional. "Eu subestimei completamente a oposição alemã", disse Marwan Lahoud, diretor de estratégia da Eads, ao WSJ.
Pessoas familiarizadas com o raciocínio em Berlim disseram que governantes alemães duvidavam de um dos principais argumentos apresentados a eles em defesa da fusão: o de que o acordo aumentaria as vendas de produtos de defesa da Eads nos Estados Unidos.
A Alemanha também temia acabar marginalizada pela França e pelo Reino Unido, que são maiores nos setores aeroespacial e de defesa. Os três países queriam proteger empregos e unidades industriais. A França queria manter suas ações da Eads, enquanto os britânicos queriam reduzir a influência política.
As empresas agora têm o desafio de reconstruir as relações entre acionistas e governos. (Colaboraram William Boston, William Horobin, Matthew Curtin, Daniel Michaels, David Gauthier-Villas, Dana Cimilluca, Marcus Walker e Marietta Cauchi.)

Biography
May 1, 2013
The World's Greatest Orator appeared before the press yesterday, and here are some highlights of his remarks: "This is hard stuff. . . . Maybe I should just pack up and go home. Golly. I think it's a little--as Mark Twain said, rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point. . . . Right now things are pretty dysfunctional up on Capitol Hill. . . . You seem to suggest that somehow these folks over there [in Congress] have no responsibilities and that my job is to somehow get them to behave. That's their job. . . . I cannot force Republicans to embrace those common-sense solutions. . . . We're going to try to do everything we can to create a permission structure for them to be able to do what's going to be best for the country." Enlarge Image
Gray skies are gonna clear up, put on a happy face!
Zuma Press If only they could bottle this stuff and sell it, they'd have a sleeping pill that lasts eight years. President Obama's performance reminded National Journal's Ron Fournier of a long-ago news conference in which President Clinton projected "a sense of helplessness--or even haplessness--against forces seemingly out of a president's control." That was on April 18, 1995, shortly after the Republicans took Congress and before Clinton figured out how to get the better of them. "It was, by most accounts, the lowest point of the Clinton presidency," Fournier writes. "The next day, domestic terrorists bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and Clinton's strong response put him back on track for reelection in 1996." We hope no one accuses us of being an Obama-hating wingnut, but we really hope something like that doesn't happen again. Fournier, it should be noted, has a tendency to run hot and cold. (We blame global warming.) Just a day earlier he was exulting over the president's "amazing speech" at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner Saturday. Actually he referred to the final section of the speech, which was in a serious vein. According to Fournier, it "may stand as one of the best rhetorical moments of Obama's presidency"--a low enough standard to make the claim arguable, but even so, the passages Fournier quoted seem to us far less impressive than Fournier thinks. Perhaps then Fournier is overreacting to Obama's press-conference performance. With characteristic contrarianness, blogress Ann Althouse speculates that Obama's performance in "the Theater of the Ineffectual President" was "a scene in the script for winning the midterms. I can't accomplish anything without Congress. Congress is the problem. He needs his Congress. Will we not give this beautiful man. . . the Congress that will bring his presidency to a successful end." It's a clever theory but not a realistic plan. There's no doubt that die-hard Democrats will respond in the way Althouse imagines they are expected to. Every time we write a column making note of Obama's deficiencies of political skill, our small gaggle of fanboy adversaries on Twitter honk away at the "obstructionist Republicans" they believe are to blame for all that is wrong. Of course one man's obstructionist is another's valiant defender of the republic, but to insist on the former designation begs the question anyway. The Republicans in 1995 were no less "obstructionist" than today's, but Clinton was able to master the problem. At any rate, it's a safe bet there aren't enough die-hard Democrats in the right places to cost Republicans the House next year on the basis of an appeal like this. If there were, Nancy Pelosi would be speaker already. Even keeping the Senate in Democratic hands isn't a sure thing, given that the Senate class up next year is heavily Democratic but from heavily Republican states. In a rather droll follow-up piece today, Fournier employs a sports analogy. He quotes a sportswriter's aphorism--"The great ones play above the breaks"--and applies it to the president: "Can President Obama play above the breaks? Will he be remembered for his great leadership or bad breaks?" But the analogy breaks down when Fournier gets to Obama's grousing about his adversaries in Congress: Obama needs a coach to look him in the eyes and say, "Mr. President, I'm not excusing the other team. They suck. But you need to beat them, sir. That's your job, because if you can't stop them, we lose. And there's no excuse to losing to such a lousy-bleeping team." In sports, of course, coaches and players are happy when opposing teams "suck," for that makes them easy to beat. But Fournier is conflating two different elements of politics. Elections, like a baseball game, are zero-sum: One side wins, the other loses. But governing or legislating is more complicated. It requires both compromise and persuasion--the ability to yield to your adversaries and to make them feel it is in their interest to yield to you. It also requires a practical sense of both how your ideas will go over politically, how to make them go over favorably, and how they will actually work in practice. Obama is sorely lacking in all these skills--which even his detractors must acknowledge makes his re-election an impressive feat. The Althouse theory raises another question: If Obama succeeded in electing a Democratic Congress next year, what would he do with it? The president did not do much by way of outlining an agenda for 2015. He didn't mention his failed gun-control initiatives (though reporter Jonathan Karl did), which were blocked by the Democratic Senate. He did mention immigration reform, but he said he's "confident" the current Congress will pass that. And the substance of his comments about the problems currently facing the country was in line with the hapless tone of the passages we quoted atop this column. John Podhoretz likens him to Chip Diller, "the college boy who keeps screaming, 'Remain calm! All is well!,' as the town of Faber collapses around him at the end of 'National Lampoon's Animal House.' " He made as unconvincing a case against the sequester spending limits as could be imagined: Just one interesting statistic when it comes to airports. There was a recent survey of the top airports . . . in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25. Not one. Not one U.S. airport was considered by the experts and consumers who use these airports to be in the top 25 in the world. I think Cincinnati Airport came in around 30th. What does that say about our long-term competitiveness and future? And so when folks say, well, there was some money in the FAA to deal with these furloughs [of air traffic controllers]--well, yeah, the money is this pool of funds that are supposed to try to upgrade our airports so we don't rank in the bottom of industrialized countries when it comes to our infrastructure. Let's assume for the sake of argument that the president is correct about the poor state of America's airports. Until this week, he's telling us, the Federal Aviation Administration had a pot of money "to try to upgrade them." That money appears to have been wasted. Why not use it on something useful like air traffic control? He dithered on Syria, saying that the use of chemical weapons by Bashar Assad's regime "is a game-changer"--by which he means "that we would have to rethink the range of options that are available to us." That'll keep Assad up nights. He made excuses for the FBI's losing track of the Boston bombing brothers: The Russian intelligence services had alerted U.S. intelligence about the older brother, as well as the mother, indicating that they might be sympathizers to extremists. The FBI investigated that older brother. It's not as if the FBI did nothing. They not only investigated the older brother, they interviewed the older brother. They concluded that there were no signs that he was engaging in extremist activity. So that much we know. Heckuva job! But what was to our mind most stunning was the president's lengthy call for shutting the terrorist detention facility at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, a promise he failed to keep in his first term. Reporter Bill Plante asked the question, in a way that suggested he sympathized with the detainees: "Mr. President, as you're probably aware, there's a growing hunger strike [in] Guantanamo Bay among prisoners there. Is it any surprise really that they would prefer death rather than have no end in sight to their confinement?" A strong president would have disputed the question's premise. Obama accepted it: The notion that we're going to continue to keep over a hundred individuals in a no-man's land in perpetuity, even at a time when we've wound down the war in Iraq, we're winding down the war in Afghanistan, we're having success defeating al Qaeda core, we've kept the pressure up on all these transnational terrorist networks, when we've transferred detention authority in Afghanistan -- the idea that we would still maintain forever a group of individuals who have not been tried, that is contrary to who we are, it is contrary to our interests, and it needs to stop. Now, it's a hard case to make because I think for a lot of Americans the notion is out of sight, out of mind. And it's easy to demagogue the issue. That's what happened the first time this came up. I'm going to go back at it because I think it's important. The terrorists at Guantanamo have long used hunger strikes, riots and even suicide as tactics of "asymmetrical warfare," as Adm. Harry Harris, then the commander of the detention facility, told this columnist in 2006. One expects the president to project resolve against the nation's enemies, especially in the wake of a successful attack on U.S. soil just the week before last. Instead Obama's message to the terrorists at Guantanamo is that he would very much like to give in to their demands. But it's a doubly weak message, because Obama lacks the capacity to carry out that wish for appeasement. He complained yesterday that his plan to shut Guantanamo was thwarted because "Congress determined that they would not let us close it." He didn't mention that was at a time when Democrats had supermajorities in both houses of Congress. Terrorists are antagonistic toward the U.S. and don't care about Democrats vs. Republicans or the White House vs. Congress. They'll likely interpret the president's promise to close Guantanamo as a sign of weakness and his failure to do so as a betrayal. Americans, however, should understand it as an indication that Obama's commitment to leftist ideology is much stronger than his political abilities. Gay DNA? One fascinating oddity of the contemporary multicultural left is that it is devoted to the assumption that no important differences between people, and especially groups of people, are genetically determined--with one exception. Such "blank slatism" is most notable in debates over intelligence and differences between the sexes, which are claimed to be entirely the product of nurture rather than nature (although moderate lefties will sometimes concede a genetic basis for body size dimorphism). The exception is homosexuality, which we are supposed to believe is all in the genes. (Your sex is supposedly more malleable than the sex to which you are attracted!) The position that being gay is in the DNA is expedient, since it makes it harder to object to homosexuality on moral grounds. But we notice a bit of a crack in this dogma, and from a surprising source--the nasty partisans at ThinkProgress.org. TP's Zack Ford highlights a comment from Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association, in response to the "coming out" of basketball player Jason Collins: Collins has an identical twin, Jaron, who was "astounded" to discover that his brother had entered into the homosexual lifestyle. He, despite sharing Jason's identical DNA, is as straight as a laser beam. Identical twins share straits [sic!] that are genetically determined: height, skin color, eye color, hair color and so forth. If homosexuality is a genetically caused sexual preference, Jaron Collins should be as gay as his brother. He's not. Here's Ford's rebuttal: Just because homosexuality is a bit more complex than a particular gene prescription doesn't mean Fischer's point has any validity. The latest research suggests that variations in sexual orientation can be influenced--not by the genes themselves, but by how certain markers ("epi-marks") on the genes interact with hormones inside the womb. These epigenetic markers act as switches that can be activated during fetal development, affecting how DNA expresses itself. The end result is the same: an individual's orientation is determined before birth and cannot be changed. This actually jibes with some recent twin studies, which suggest that even identical twins who share a hormonal environment in the womb can still experience different levels of blood during development. Thus, even twins with identical DNA can have differences in how that DNA is expressed. Ford had the better of the argument, but he got it by making an important concession: that environmental factors as well as genes play a role in determining sexual orientation. Some gene or combination of genes might have been necessary for Jason Collins to be homosexual, but it was not sufficient. Another way of putting this is that Collins evidently had the DNA to be heterosexual but his environment, unlike his brother's, was insufficient to yield that result. Which raises an interesting question. Suppose researchers isolated both a gene that predisposed the Collins brothers to homosexuality and a prenatal hormonal condition that caused that predisposition to manifest itself in Jason's case but not his brother. Suppose further that parents or unborn children could be tested for that gene, and mothers carrying sons who have it could be administered a hormone treatment that would reduce or eliminate the possibility of a homosexual child. Would gay-rights groups push for outlawing such a therapy? If so, would their pro-abortion allies join the push, or would they feel compelled to stand for "reproductive rights"? If such a therapy were available, would parents forgo it given the increasing public acceptance of homosexuality? Would its popularity follow political patterns, so that conservative Southerners would opt for straight kids while liberal Northeasterners allowed nature to take its course? Or would lots of the latter group take advantage of their right to privacy and make sure their kids didn't turn out gay, not that there's anything wrong with that? Two Wannabe Sportswriters in One! "There's something noxious about seeing, in real time, someone being manufactured as a leader, a poster boy and even an icon without his proving it on the field. The [Tim] Tebow experience has been like seeing the DC political media establishment swoon over the 'next big thing' for higher office."--Dave Zirin, TheNation.com, Oct. 31, 2011 "Thanks to the courage of 34-year-old NBA veteran Jason Collins, we can no longer repeat endlessly that no active male athlete in North America has ever come out of the closet. Instead we're now able to say that we were there when our most influential cultural citadel of homophobia--the men's locker room--was forever breached and finally received a rainbow makeover on its unforgiving grey walls. But we didn't only get the act of coming out. We also got, courtesy of Mr. Collins and Sports Illustrated writer Franz Lidz, about as beautiful a coming-out statement as has ever been put to paper."--Dave Zirin, TheNation.com, April 30, 2013 'Food Insecurity' A reader has persuaded us that our stab at defining "food insecurity" in yesterday's column was too charitable. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service, you don't need to be at risk of starvation or even malnutrition to be "food insecure." To have "low food security," it's sufficient to have "reduced quality, variety, or desirability of diet" and not necessary to have any "indication of reduced food intake." Heck, we've got three steaks in the freezer but are all out of duck. We guess that makes us food insecure. Fox Butterfield, Is That You?

The party's nominee for next week's special election is none other than Mark Sanford, the former governor whose political career seemed over after he mysteriously disappeared, claimed to have been "hiking the Appalachian Trail," and then turned out to have been in Argentina carrying on an extramarital affair. Republicans likely are hoping to lose this, because they'd have an easier time picking the seat up in 2014 with a different candidate than defending it with Sanford. Meanwhile, the Hollywood Reporter reports Sanford has received an endorsement that might not be of much help: Hustler publisher Larry Flynt endorsed conservative Republican Mark Sanford's bid for South Carolina congressional seat Tuesday, hailing the state's disgraced former governor as "the sex pioneer of our time." . . . Flynt said Tuesday that he also was donating the maximum legal contribution--$2,600—to Sanford's campaign. He said "no one has done more to expose the sexual hypocrisy of traditional values in America today. He is the man of the hour—the midnight hour. He has demonstrated by his words and deeds that traditional values are shameful and that he will not live by such rules. As the bible teaches us: 'Ye shall know them by their fruits.' " . . . The publisher said the decision to back the conservative, who is not being supported by the national Republican Party's congressional fundraising arm, "has not been an easy decision for me. Even though Mark Sanford has emerged as the leader against sexual hypocrisy in American politics, he is a liar. He lied to his gubernatorial staff. He lied to his wife. He lied to his children. He lied to the people of South Carolina and to the press. Despite his journey down this Appalachian Trail of deceit, I support him not for his character, but for exposing the hypocrisy of traditional values. The liar has exposed the greater lie." The funniest part of this is Flynt's claim that he agonized over whether to pull this hilarious stunt. A source sends along an invitation from a February New York City fundraiser for Sanford's congressional campaign. One of the hosts was financier Ryan Morfin, whom TalkingPointsMemo.com identified three years ago as a member of the Young Eagles, a program for young GOP donors "whose night out at a bondage-themed LA club ended up on the [Republican National] committee's tab." (We think that's Los Angeles, not Louisiana.) After the Democrats held the White House and the Senate last year, one often heard that Republicans were too much in thrall to social conservatives. Perhaps the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction. Follow us on Twitter. Join Fans of Best of the Web Today on Facebook.
