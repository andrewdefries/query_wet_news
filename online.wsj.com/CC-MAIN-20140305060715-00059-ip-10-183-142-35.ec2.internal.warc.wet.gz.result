Texas Gov. Rick Perry addresses college-bound student Janahy Aguilar, far left, last week in Dallas, where he announced an education initiative.
Dallas Morning News / Associated Press For sale: a college education for $10,000 or less. Texas Gov. Rick Perry is renewing his call for such lower-cost undergraduate degrees, in what he hopes will be the state's signature response to the national problem of rising college tuition and student debt. "A $10,000 degree provides an opportunity for students to earn a low-cost, high-quality degree that will get them where they want to go in their careers and their lives," the Republican governor said in a statement last week. The governor has repeatedly urged schools to find ways to teach students more efficiently. Ten Texas colleges have responded to the governor's challenge, first made a year ago. Angelo State University, a 7,000-student school in west Texas, announced Wednesday it will offer a $10,000 degree starting next fall. The 10 schools educate more than 50,000 students, or roughly 10% of the undergraduates at public universities in the state, but don't include the state's flagship public universities, such as the University of Texas at Austin. Vote As details of the colleges' plans have emerged, so have skeptics who question the financial and academic viability of pricing college at a fraction of the roughly $30,000 that students at Texas public universities pay on average over four years. They say reaching the $10,000 goal in some cases involves big scholarships for select students rather than real reductions in the cost of providing an education, and thus the path to a low-cost degree still isn't open to large numbers of students. Taylor Ball, a graduate student in education at Angelo State, said the school's reduced-rate degree doesn't cover many significant costs, including campus housing, meal plans and textbooks. "It's those other fees that really get you," she said. Mr. Perry's plan comes at a time when tuition is soaring; undergraduate costs at public four-year universities climbed 139% between 1990 and 2010, according to the nonprofit College Board. For the 2011-12 academic year, average tuition and fees across the nation were $8,244 at a four-year public university and $28,500 at a private institution, the College Board said. Driving recent price increases are cuts in appropriations for higher education by states as they struggle to balance their budgets. Between 2006 and 2011 state governments appropriated 12.5% less per student, according to a March report by the State Higher Education Officers. One result is that students are taking on increasing amounts of education-related debt. Americans owed $904 billion in student loans at the end of March, nearly 8% more than a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That compares with the $679 billion they owed on credit cards at the end of the first quarter. A handful of public and private schools have experimented with ways to reduce costs. The University of the South in Tennessee cut tuition by 10% two years ago. That same year, Seton Hall University, a private school in New Jersey, cut tuition 68% for certain top students to match the in-state rate for Rutgers University, a nearby public school. In Texas, the University of Texas at Arlington introduced a $10,000-degree track that will credit classes students take in high school and at a local community college, and incorporate a $10,000 scholarship to qualifying students. Texas A&M University-Commerce, near Dallas, will offer a $10,000 degree in "organizational leadership" that will award some course credits to students as soon as they have demonstrated competency in a subject, such as accounting, by passing an exam—a potentially quicker route to a degree than the usual method of awarding credits only after students have spent a certain amount of time in class. To offer its new $9,974 degree, starting next year, Angelo State will increase class sizes, offer courses online and will incorporate a $5,000 annual scholarship for participating students. To qualify, students must have relatively high standardized test scores and maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or better. The program is designed for mature students, such as those with work experience who are prepared to be focused in their pursuit of a degree, said Angelo State President Joseph Rallo,
who notes that younger students often take relatively light course loads and struggle to complete their degrees in four years. The push for lower-cost degrees has generated widespread concern among Texas professors, who say they fear schools are sacrificing quality by seeking savings, for instance by increasing the use of adjunct professors. Adjunct faculty often are paid on a per-class basis and have to teach heavy loads just to earn a modest living, leaving them little time to advise and guide student outside the classroom, said Ann McGlashan,
a Baylor University professor who heads the Texas chapter of the American Association of University Professors. Thomas Lindsay,
an education expert at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank in Austin, said critiques of low-cost degrees miss the broader significance—that colleges, for the first time, are broadly thinking of ways to lower their costs. "The governor has incentivized the sort of creativity on the part of schools that it is going to take to address the college affordability problem," he said.

Sun Microsystems Inc. and other giant Silicon Valley tech companies. Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla,
a founder of Sun Microsystems and a Stanford alumnus, said he signed up a month and a half ago as one of several investors who serve as sponsors and advisors. Another venture capitalist, George Zachary,
a partner at Charles River Ventures and known for his early bet in Twitter Inc., said he spends about two hours a week at SSE Labs as a mentor to the student entrepreneurs. "Most entrepreneurs are in their 20s, and they don't understand a lot of the issues around company building—learning how to recruit people, how to create a vision, how to resolve conflict among founders," said Mr. Zachary, who wrote the first check to help get SSE Labs started. "College doesn't train people how to be leaders." That's the aim of the student-led SSE Labs. While the university has long served as a launchpad for innovation, it's lacked the infrastructure to provide students with all the nuts and bolts needed to build companies, graduates say. You're Either In Or You're Not Like Y Combinator and other popular business accelerators, SSE Labs chooses the brightest founders from a large batch of applicants to participate in a weeks-long mentoring program, in this case for the three-month duration of the fall, spring or summer sessions. Housing the start-ups thanks to a partnership with AOL, SSE Labs brings in a host of mentors—venture capitalists, angel investors, lawyers, serial entrepreneurs—to provide advice, while also offering customized classes around logistics such as marketing and employment issues, and providing resources like free web hosting via Amazon.com Inc.

and legal services from law firm Dorsey & Whitney. It also holds a "Demo Day," where its member companies pitch to investors. But SSE Labs is different in a notable way, besides not taking any equity in the start-ups like Y Combinator does. Operating as a nonprofit division of the student government's financial arm, it requires that at least one founder have been enrolled as a Stanford student within the last three quarters of the application period, and this founder must own a significant percentage of the equity. For that reason, SSE Labs is able to take full advantage of Stanford's rich alumni community of entrepreneurs, investors and executives, ready to help out with not just money, but advice. Other universities have incubators of sorts. The University of Utah launched the Foundry a year ago to help students create businesses, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology runs a well-established, two-month mentorship program where selected students are paired with experienced entrepreneurs or venture capitalists to compete for a $100,000 prize. But, arguably, no school is more entrenched at the cross section of high-tech and finance than Stanford. "In Silicon Valley you're either on the inside or you're not," said Michael Carter,
a co-founder of SSE Labs start-up Game Closure, which is developing a multiplayer game development kit. "This program allows students to join the in-crowd without having to spend three years establishing contacts." Entrepreneurial Education, Easy Money Including the current crop of nine companies about to graduate, 20 start-ups have gone through the program. Of those, at least six have raised seed capital, including educational game maker Motion Math, which took part in last year's summer session and raised financing from angels including Mitch Kapor,
the founder of Lotus Development Corp. Another five SSE Labs start-ups are in the midst of raising funding, including Game Closure. The founders are mum when it comes to their financing plans or investors, but access to capital isn't exactly difficult. "We made one request through SSE Labs to get a meeting with a partner at a venture capital firm, and within a week I was in the office talking" to the investor, Mr. Carter said. "We're able to move a lot faster and get what we need without worrying about it." Their timing couldn't be better. The emergence of SSE Labs is in lockstep with the latest Web investment boom. That's not lost on the investors who serve as sponsors or mentors, who get an inside look at the program's young companies. Mr. Zachary of Charles River Ventures, which has made 57 seed investments in the past four years, including 42 in the past 18 months, said he's already backed two SSE Labs start-ups (he declined to name them) and is working on closing a third deal. Mr. Khosla hasn't invested in any of the companies but said he might if he found the right one. Stanford Support But obtaining financing is not the point of the program, organizers emphasize. "We have touchpoints with every top-tier venture capital firm," said Dan Ha,
co-founder and managing director of SSE Labs, who graduated from Stanford in December. "But our top focus is the development of the entrepreneur." When co-founder Cameron Teitelman
looked into getting a business accelerator off the ground a couple of years ago, he talked to 220 former students who are now entrepreneurs to find out what Stanford needed. The student government, which operates independently of the university, had just scrapped a venture capital fund it created in 2008 called SSE Ventures that invested directly in student-led start-ups. The best entrepreneurs were simply going to Sand Hill Road for capital. What Mr. Teitelman found from their research was that the while the student entrepreneurs considered Stanford a great educational resource, there was little support when it came to starting a company. Paul Graham,
who heads Y Combinator, also sat down with them for a few hours, Mr. Ha said, stressing the community aspect of start-up accelerators--bringing entrepreneurs together allows them to feed off each other but also creates an added element of competition. (Mr. Graham couldn't immediately be reached to comment.) So after selling the idea to Stanford's faculty and administration, and despite some opposition from other student-led entrepreneurial groups on campus, Messrs. Ha and Teitelman launched SSE Labs in the summer of 2010 using money from Stanford Student Enterprises, which makes about $16 million annually mainly from selling Stanford apparel and distributing advertising-based coupon books. AOL provides the office space, and a slew of professionals hold in-house office hours or classes. In three sessions, SSE Labs has received a total of 190 applications, and accepted 20 companies. It's evaluating more than 100 for the upcoming summer session and is expected to accept as many as 18 companies, said Mr. Ha, who separately is developing his own start-up with Mr. Khosla's daughter, Nina, who graduated last year from Stanford with a degree in product design. "I wish I had more time for these young groups. Sometimes you get shocked at how much these 20-year-olds know," Mr. Khosla said. Write to Scott Austin at scott.austin@dowjones.com Email
