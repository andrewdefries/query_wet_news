In 1999, Michael Bruno did the same thing as many aesthetically minded, adventurous young Americans before him: He packed up his belongings and headed for Paris. Enlarge Image
Michael Bruno
"The dollar was so strong, I was buying things up like a drunken sailor," said Mr. Bruno, who had previously been working as a real estate broker in San Francisco. He had already renovated and decorated several of his own homes and had brokered multimillion-dollar property sales for San Francisco's young Internet moguls. He began scouring the Clignancourt flea market and—despite his inability to speak French—convinced high-end Parisian dealers to showcase their wares on 1stdibs.com, the trade-only website he'd just built. Since its launch in 2000, the lushly produced site has grown to include nearly 1,000 leading dealers of antiques, modern furniture, estate jewelry and vintage fashion. And this month, the site is expanding to include fine art. Currently exhibiting the top fine art dealers in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago, the site will ultimately include galleries in 10 cities. Enlarge Image

While his competitor artnet.com has a voluminous selection, Mr. Bruno likened his site to a small boutique. The 47-year-old elaborated, "When users go on artnet, they're in a research state of mind. When they come to 1stdibs, they're in a luxury shopping state of mind." 1stdibs.com uses a subscription-based model, charging dealers between $500 and $2,000 a month. Last month, Mr. Bruno said, 1stdibs.com counted 33 million page views, up from 12 million in October of 2009. Each week, Mr. Bruno and his team of editors and photographers add about 2,200 new items, and the dealers showcased on 1stdibs sell about 1,500 items. Enlarge Image

"When we started with just furniture, the average price per item was about $7,000. We added vintage fashion and jewelry and the average price went to about $5,500," he said. "We anticipate the number going back up with this month's addition of fine arts." Though he cautions it's still early, Mr. Bruno predicts his shoppers will flock to photography, where prices range from $2,000 to $200,000. Mr. Bruno credits Paris with teaching him about "amazing" objects, but he is thoroughly American in his approach to sales. It's a long way from his early beginnings, when to goose sales and get wary antiquarians to use his site, Mr. Bruno quietly became his own best customer and his apartment overflowed with French antiques. "Living in Paris didn't influence my business decisions, because if it did, I'd still just be selling things from the Paris flea market," he said. "That was fun and carefree, but I wanted to do more." Wish fulfilled. Château de Chantilly in France
Corbis Below, Mr. Bruno answers some questions about art, the Internet and margaritas. Online, I buy mostly furniture, lighting and objects and now art. I am a true junkie. Yes, I have shopped on Gilt. Just yesterday I brought two Thom Brown suits to the tailor that I purchased last year but never had fitted. Neither of them is right and it's too late to return them. From now on, I am sticking to cashmere throws and polo shirts on Gilt, and buying my suits at Bergdorf Goodman. Browsing the Web can be as fun and pleasurable as browsing a gallery. I wanted a faux bois cabinet for a front porch I'm renovating. I went on the site and looked at 30 options. It just opens up a whole new way to be able to make choices. I wanted to buy "Fun," a three-dimensional wall-mounted word sculpture by New York artist Chris Caccamise, who is represented by Eleven Rivington Gallery. But by the time I contacted them—it was only on the site for a few days—it was already sold. I love being at my country house, driving around in my 1963 convertible Mercedes, wearing my 1940s René Boivin cufflinks. Enlarge Image

My night table is a 1940s Jansen round table with a black marble top and a gilt bronze base. On top, there is a vintage lamp and a pile of books that I intend to read along with a glass of 9.0ph balanced Kangen water. When I'm traveling, I always stay at the Four Seasons. They have the best trained staff on the planet. But I also hold a soft spot in my heart for the La Valencia Hotel in La Jolla. The manager always brings me a margarita with no salt, my favorite. The best decorative arts museum is the Château de Chantilly in France—it's the worlds largest one-bedroom home. My favorite Paris boîte is Le Voltaire. The best galleries in the world are on the left bank in Paris, particularly along the rue Bonaparte and rue de Seine. My favorite boutiques and galleries: Brunello Cucinelli in New York City for cashmere, Galerie Yves Gastou in Paris for design and Regen Projects in Los Angeles for art. The worst thing about shopping online is organizing the returns. Once I buy something, it's not going back. I've learned that the Internet is always changing and there is always someone looking for a way to take over your territory, so you'd better be working on ways to take over someone else's.

Time turned these few feathers to stone, pressing them between layers of volcanic ash with the weight of 125 million years. To paleontologist Xing Xu at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who analyzed them, these exotic quills are the earliest known prototype of all the pinions, plumes and flight feathers that cloak the 9,500 or so species of birds alive today -- a primeval tubular filament predicted by evolutionary theory but never fully documented in fossils until now. Early 'Birds'Review some of the scores of dinosaur fossils that have helped document how feathers evolved well before the advent of birds.

A model of a Microraptor in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Associated Press In life, the stiff six-inch spines crowned a pot-bellied herbivore with Freddy Kreuger claws called Beipiaosaurus, a flightless cousin of modern birds that thrived in northern China during an era when life was a primordial riot of forms and possibilities. In that early day, some creatures flew on four wings, not two, and predators were ferocious fluff-balls. The sickle-clawed predecessors of Velociraptor were covered from head-to-toe in down -- a far cry from the leathery raptors that prowled the fictional Jurassic Park. They most likely brooded over eggs like modern fowl, recent discoveries suggest. "This new type is very important for understanding the evolution of feathers," says Dr. Xu, a senior researcher from the Academy's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing. He and his colleagues reported their conclusions earlier this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "It shows how fossil data and developmental theory work together to answer an evolutionary question." People have been making a fuss over feathers since the first fossil of one was unearthed in 1860. No one knows exactly where, when or why this body covering evolved. By analyzing how feathers grow among modern birds today, however, evolutionary biologists have proposed that feathers must have developed in distinct stages, each new form adapting and altering what had come before. One by one, these theoretical structures are being validated by fossil finds from China. Recommended ReadingResearchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences report their new analysis of a primitive feathered dinosaur in "A new feather type in a nonavian theropod and the early evolution of feathers" in The Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences. In 1999, they first described the find in "A therizinosauroid dinosaur with integumentary structures from China," published in Nature. Paleontologist Xing Xu explores the origins of feathers and avian flight in "Feathered dinosaurs from China and the evolution of major avian characters" published in the journal Integrative Zoology. Dr. Xu also explores related fossil finds in "Palaeontology:&nbsp;Scales, feathers and dinosaurs." In a broader look at evolutionary biology, paleontologist Neil Shubin draws the connections between our own body and the 3.5-billion-year history of life in Your Inner Fish. Evolutionary biologist Sean B. Carroll recounts the adventures of scientists who pioneered the study of life's history in a forthcoming book Remarkable Creatures. In celebration of the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin's groundbreaking book on natural selection, author David Quammen has edited a special volume called On The Origin of Species: The Illustrated Edition.
"The first feather should basically be an unbranched tube," says evolutionary ornithologist Richard Prum at Yale University, among those who proposed the theory. "These things that Beipiaosaurs have look exactly like that." Not so long ago, scientists were convinced that only birds had feathers. Since 1995, however, scores of fossils belonging to feathered dinosaurs have been excavated from the hillsides of Liaoning province, between Beijing and North Korea. In the last eight years alone, Dr. Xu has helped identify 27 new dinosaur types from these deposits, from a tiny feather duster called Microraptor to a 3,000-pound plumed bruiser called Gigantoraptor. All these feathered flightless dinosaurs, however, co-existed with species of true birds. Researchers still seek the older fossils that could completely bridge the gap between them. "No one can say that Beipiaosaurus is the ancestor of birds. It clearly is not," says paleontologist Thomas R. Holtz Jr. at the University of Maryland. "It was a weird, ugly distant cousin." Taken together, though, these fossils offer proof that feathers evolved among a diverse family of meat-eating theropod dinosaurs, well before the advent of birds or feathered flight, says Luis Chiappe, director of the Dinosaur Institute at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History. "This gives you a hint of what the ancestral feather may have looked like," Dr. Chiappe says. "This animal -- Beipiaosaurus -- must have had a huge amount of plumage." In addition to feathers, other researchers have documented about 100 anatomical similarities between modern birds and flightless dinosaurs. Still, the debate over avian evolution and the origin of feathers is far from settled. "What we are finding is that many of the things that we thought were unique to birds owe their origins to the history of dinosaurs," says Dr. Prum. In turn, "this is totally changing our perspective on dinosaurs we thought we knew so well." By transforming such notions, these finds neatly illustrate how the evidence of fossils can dovetail with the theories of developmental biology, turning informed conjecture into evolutionary fact.

In his own day, Charles Darwin, the 19th century naturalist who identified natural selection as the prime agent of evolution, believed fossils offered an important check on his own ideas of variation and adaptation. "If my theory be true," he wrote in "The Origin of Species" 150 years ago, "numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all species of the same group, must have assuredly existed." Next month marks the 200th anniversary of his birth. Shortly after he published his landmark tome, researchers in Germany discovered the fossil remains of a 150 million-year-old lizard-like bird called Archaeopteryx that combines fully developed feathers with more primitive features of a small carnivorous dinosaur. It is still the earliest and most primitive bird known. "Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world," Mr. Darwin wrote at the time. The quest to recover these missing chapters in Earth's autobiography invigorated him. "The pleasure of the first day's partridge shooting or the first day's hunting cannot be compared to finding a fine group of fossils bones, which tell their story of former times with almost a living tongue," Mr. Darwin wrote his sister Catherine in 1834. Like so many things in life, though, fossils reveal their secrets by happenstance. So it was with the perplexing specimens of Beipiaosuarus. When a farmer found the first fossil of the creature a decade ago. Dr. Xu and his colleagues immediately recognized it as one of the largest feathered dinosaurs they had ever seen, a member of an obscure family of creatures called therizinosaurs. "This group is like a dinosaur designed by a committee, with bits and pieces of other major groups of dinosaurs thrown together," says Dr. Holtz.

In technical papers describing the find, the researchers reported traces of the relatively modern complex feathers seen on other dinosaurs of the same time and place, but they overlooked the telltale signs of the creature's simpler, more primitive spines. Like any bird today, it had more than one kind of feather. Last year, however, Dr. Xu studied a more recently excavated specimen of the beast and spotted the distinctive ruffs and ruffles of quills. "Immediately, I noticed that it has very, very long rigid filaments attached to the skull and attached to the neck," he says. "They are different from the primitive feathers I have noticed on other specimens." Through such flukes of preservation are dinosaurs revealed as flightless birds of a feather.
