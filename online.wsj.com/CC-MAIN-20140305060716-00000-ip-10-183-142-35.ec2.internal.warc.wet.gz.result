Joy Ying Zhang, working Tuesday in his office at Carnegie Mellon's Silicon Valley campus, says he doesn't plan to return to China.
Brian L. Frank for The Wall Street Journal Most foreigners who came to the U.S. to earn doctorate degrees in science and engineering stayed on after graduation—at least until the recession began—refuting predictions that post-9/11 restrictions on immigrants or expanding opportunities in China and India would send more of them home. Newly released data revealed that 62% of foreigners holding temporary visas who earned Ph.D.s in science and engineering at U.S. universities in 2002 were still in the U.S. in 2007, the latest year for which figures are available. Of those who graduated in 1997, 60% were still in the U.S. in 2007, according to the data compiled by the U.S. Energy Department's Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education for the National Science Foundation. Who Stays?

More photos and interactive graphics Foreigners account for about 40% of all science and engineering Ph.D. holders working in the U.S., and a larger fraction in engineering, math and computer fields. "Our ability to continue to attract and keep foreign scientists and engineers is critical to…increase investment in science and technology," Oak Ridge analyst Michael Finn said. "Data for all available cohorts indicate that 'stay rates' of foreign science and engineering doctorate recipients in 2007 are slightly higher than they have been in recent years," Mr. Finn said. His findings, which use tax data to track graduates over time, cover the years before the U.S. plunged into a recession that damped job prospects in many U.S. industries and universities. Other analysts see signs that recent foreign grads are increasingly likely to return home, particularly in today's weak job market. "I have no doubt that the 2009 data will show a dramatic shift," said Vivek Wadwha, executive in residence at Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering, who has been warning loudly about the threat that trend would pose to innovation in the U.S. In October 2008, Mr. Wadwha and others used Facebook to question 1,224 foreigners studying at U.S. institutions at all levels. More than half the Indians and 40% of the Chinese said they hoped to return home within five years. Separate NSF surveys show the fraction of foreign Ph.D.s planning to stay in the U.S. dipped in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack and then rebounded. Nearly 80% of those with temporary visas surveyed in 2007 said they planned to stay; more than half had definite plans to do so. Joy Ying Zhang, the son of a primary-school teacher and a college professor, left China's Hunan Province in 1999 for Detroit's Wayne State University, where he arrived with two suitcases and $2,000 in cash. He later transferred to Carnegie Mellon University, which awarded him a Ph.D. in computer science in 2008. Enlarge Image

Brian L. Frank for The Wall Street Journal Read More With Fewer U.S. Opportunities, Home Looks Appealing to Expats (12/17/2009) Four or five of his friends have returned to China, he said, and he has discussed doing so. But Mr. Zhang, now a research assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon's Silicon Valley campus, has decided stay. "I have spent 10 years here already," he said. "It took me some time to get used to American life. Now, it'd be hard to get used to China. It's called 'reverse culture shock.' " Mr. Zhang, 35 years old, has a brother who works for a pharmaceutical company in the U.S. and a sister who is a physician in China and close to their parents. In recruiting for Carnegie Mellon, he finds young Chinese less eager to come to the U.S. than those of his generation. "Life in China is getting better. There are research alternatives in China—like Microsoft China," he said. "They can get good mentoring and advice there, instead of coming to the U.S." In 2007, foreign citizens accounted for 16,022 of the Ph.D.s awarded in science and engineering in the U.S., or 46% of the total, according to the Oak Ridge data. In contrast, the class of 1997 had 12,966 foreigners, or 30% of the total. Graduates of Ph.D. programs in the physical sciences and computer science are more likely to remain in the U.S. than those in other fields, Mr. Finn said. Those programs are popular with Chinese and Indian students, who are more likely to remain in the U.S. after completing studies than those from Taiwan, South Korea and Western Europe. Among 2002 graduates, 92% of the Chinese and 81% of the Indians were in the U.S. after five years; in contrast, 41% of South Koreans and 52% of Germans were. Aranyak Mehta, 31, came from India nearly a decade ago to study the science of algorithms at Georgia Institute of Technology and earned a Ph.D. in 2005. Today, he is a research scientist at Google—and planning, for now, to remain in the U.S. "There's always a trade-off—family, culture, and all that," he said. "One of the most important things with an academic background is the work that you do, and is it exciting? I'm not saying there is no exciting work in India. Many people have gone back and started companies." Using the LinkedIn online network, Mr. Wadhwa identified 1,203 skilled Indians and Chinese who had returned home. Three-quarters said visa issues weren't a factor. Rather, career opportunities, quality-of-life concerns and family ties were major factors. Some 70% of the Chinese and 61% of the Indians said opportunities for professional advancement were better at home. The NSF recently said the number of foreign science and engineering students enrolled in graduate programs of all types hit 158,430 in April 2009, up 8% from the year before.

Who's rich, anyway? Congress and President Barack Obama are struggling with that question as they wrangle over how to avoid the "fiscal cliff." If they can't reach a decision, tax rates will increase sharply for most Americans—both rich and not—and draconian spending cuts of $110 billion will kick in. Enlarge Image
Palm Beach, Fla.
Hemis/Zuma Press It isn't as easy as you might think to determine who is rich. There are many different yardsticks devised by Uncle Sam, banks, brokerage firms and other institutions. The thresholds—as low as $44,000 for people receiving Social Security benefits—matter because they determine the taxes you owe, the college aid you receive, the investments you have access to and the fees you pay. Overall, the top 1% of U.S. households have a net worth above $6.8 million or at least $521,000 in income, according to data from the Federal Reserve and the Tax Policy Center in Washington. The cutoffs for the top 5% are $1.9 million in net worth, or $209,000 in income. View Graphics
(top row, l-r): Express/Getty Images; Bloomberg News; Getty Images; Associated Press; (bottom row, l-r): Palm Beach Post/Zuma Press ; Bloomberg News; Everett Collection; Bloomberg News Needless to say, these national figures obscure large geographic differences. A prince of income in Danville, Va., is a relative pauper in New York City. In Danville, the threshold for the top 1% of earners kicked in at $179,000, while it took $588,000 to reach the top 1% in New York City and northern New Jersey, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal of U.S. Census Bureau data from 2007 to 2009 collected by the University of Minnesota Population Center. The income threshold for the top 1% falls midway between Danville and New York in places like Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Atlanta; Rochester, N.Y.; Miami; San Luis Obispo, Calif.; and Peoria, Ill. Enlarge Image
Masked guests at Truman Capote's Black-and-White Ball in New York City, in 1966. Hulton Archive/Getty Images Then there are emotional measures of wealth. H.L. Mencken once quipped that wealth in America means making a little more money than your brother-in-law. Samuel Johnson was just as shrewd, if less cynical. He wrote: "Every man is rich or poor according to the proportion between his desires and his enjoyments." So if your wishes align with your purse, the amount of money in it doesn't much matter. It is up to the politicians to determine who is rich under 2013 income, capital-gains and estate-tax rules. Here are some important thresholds that won't change next year—from lowest to highest—plus tips for making them work in your favor. $44,000 for Couples ($32,000 for Singles) This is the threshold at which 85% of Social Security benefits begin to be taxed. It isn't indexed for inflation. (At a lower level, 50% of benefits are taxed.) Enlarge Image
Mr. Capote in New York in 1966. Express Newspapers/Getty Images For most taxpayers, this threshold is computed by adding tax-free municipal-bond income plus half of Social Security benefits to adjusted gross income, or AGI. That's right: Muni income won't help avoid this tax. What will help is tax-free income from a Roth individual retirement account, which doesn't count in the calculation. In addition, owners of regular IRAs who are 70½ years or older and charitably minded can usually give up to $100,000 of donations directly from their account to charities and have it count as part of their required annual payout. There is no tax deduction for those contributions, but neither is there income that swells AGI. This wildly popular provision lapsed at the beginning of 2012, but many believe Congress will restore it retroactively. $170,000 for Couples ($85,000 for Singles) This is the level at which Medicare Part B outpatient-services and Part D drug-coverage premiums start to rise based on income for married joint filers. The Part B premium rises from $105 to $147 a month per person for couples earning above $170,000. It rises as high as $336 for couples with incomes higher than $428,000. The Part D surcharge for couples earning above $170,000 ranges from $12 to more than $65 a month. For more information on income thresholds, go to socialsecurity.gov. For many Medicare recipients, the definition of income is similar to the one for determining tax on Social Security benefits: adjusted gross income plus tax-free municipal-bond income. Most 2012 premiums will be determined using information from 2010 tax returns. Enlarge Image
A multimillion-dollar home in Greenwich, Conn. Getty Images How can you lower your income? As with Social Security benefits, tax-free Roth IRA payouts don't count as income, and people 70½ and older can help keep AGI down by making charitable donations directly from their IRA, assuming Congress renews this law. $180,000 for a Family of Four This is the informal income threshold for need-based financial aid for undergraduates at many private colleges, says Mark Kantrowitz,
the expert behind the financial-aid and scholarship resource websites FinAid.org and Fastweb.com. Besides income, the aid formula typically adds in 20% of the student's assets per year and up to 5.64% of the family's net assets (including 529 college-savings plans), but it excludes the value of retirement accounts. A rude shock for many families is that the formula includes the value of parental retirement-plan contributions starting in January of the student's junior year of high school, so it is a good idea to maximize those contributions until then. There are many variables, according to Mr. Kantrowitz. Often the most important are unusual financial circumstances—such as volatile income or high medical expenses in one year—and the number of children in college at the same time. With two children at private colleges, for example, the income threshold could be as high as $250,000 or more. But a school that denies need-based aid to a student also might give a "merit" scholarship to bolster geographic diversity, fill an undersubscribed department or activity, or maximize revenue. "These days almost everybody struggles to pay for college, regardless of income level," Mr. Kantrowitz says. "I have seen doctors living from paycheck to paycheck because of these costs." $250,000 for Couples ($200,000 for Singles) This is the threshold for the new 3.8% net investment income tax that kicks in on Jan. 1 to help finance the massive health-care changes. It applies to rents, royalties, net capital gains, interest and dividends, among other income. It doesn't apply to tax-free municipal-bond income. The tax is levied only on the amount of investment income above the threshold. So if a couple has $175,000 of wage income plus $50,000 of dividends and net capital gains, they aren't subject to the tax. If they have $150,000 of wages and $200,000 of net investment income from a windfall, then $100,000 is subject to it. For most taxpayers, the threshold is adjusted gross income. This means taxpayers will want to reduce AGI as well as time the receipt of investment income when possible. Charitable donations, mortgage interest and other itemized deductions don't help with that, but pension and 401(k) contributions can. Tax-free muni-bond income and Roth IRA income won't swell AGI, either. $417,000 This is the upper limit for a "conforming" mortgage for a single-family home in the contiguous 48 states and Puerto Rico. This limit is higher—$625,500—in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands and certain high-cost markets, such as the New York metropolitan area, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Conforming loans are mortgages that can be packaged and sold to government-sponsored buyers such as Fannie Mae

Home buyers who opt for private mortgages or "jumbo" loans on more expensive properties pay about 0.5 percentage point above the current average of 3.5% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, says Keith Gumbinger
of HSH.com, a mortgage-information website. The best way to stay below the limit, he says, is simply to buy a cheaper house or put more money down up front. With Congress considering scaling back the mortgage-interest deduction, there are tax reasons to be prudent about home mortgages as well. $1 Million/$200,000 Net worth of $1 million, excluding the value of the primary residence, or $200,000 in income for the past two years are the main requirements for "accredited investor" status, as set by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This designation allows investors to put money into lightly regulated hedge funds or private offerings. Those sums might not be sufficient, however. Some private offerings and hedge funds require investors to prove $5 million of net worth, and the median minimum for some investments is $1 million, according to eVestment, a research firm that tracks institutional money managers' performance. There can be ways around those minimums for accredited investors hungry to get into certain funds. Barclays

Wealth and Investment Management, for example, allows people with $5 million of investible assets to commit as little as $100,000 to $250,000 to funds normally requiring a $1 million minimum, says David Romhilt,
head of manager research at the Barclays unit. $10 Million A common threshold defining "ultrahigh-net worth." With variations, it is used by institutions such as Barclays, Merrill Lynch's Private Banking & Investments Group and Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Even retail giant Vanguard Group has a special category for "relationships with $10 million and more." What does this get you? Lower advisory fees, in many cases, and access to certain restricted investments. Also special treatment of large concentrated stock positions, such as hedges and collars, or attention to the execution of large trades. Ask about nonfinancial services as well. Does the hand-holding extend to finding a caterer for your daughter's wedding, or—in a pinch—walking your dog? —Julie Steinberg contributed to this article.

While the seasonal heat calls for light and floaty clothes with a touch of color or print, the skyscraping urban environment requires a sort of elegant armor. Too often, summery wardrobes lean too far toward the former. You could argue that most fashion rules are meant to be broken, but that still doesn't make a maxi dress, floppy straw hat and long beads appropriate for lunching on Madison Avenue. That's...

By
Saabira Chaudhuri
Feb. 20, 2013 6:54 a.m. ET
Toll Brothers Inc. swung to a quarterly profit as the luxury home builder capitalized on a recovering housing market to record broad revenue growth, outweighing a rise in input costs. However, results sharply missed Wall Street estimates. Toll Brothers, which caters largely to affluent move-up buyers in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, is considered one of the top performers in the home-building sector, which has shown signs of...

Local TV Stations Try Mobile Apps
By
Amol Sharma
Updated April 28, 2013 8:01 p.m. ET

But for TV...

By
Cassell Bryan-Low
Feb. 5, 2013 4:21 p.m. ET

Ah, autumn. Cooler temperatures, kids back in school—and cheap travel deals. During the "shoulder season," the time between the peak travel times of summer and the holidays, airfares to many European cities can go down an average of 40% and domestic rates decline by 20%, says Bob Harrell, owner of travel consulting firm Harrell Associates in New York. Hotel rates often have similar drops. What else is smaller? The lines and the crowds. Enlarge Image

senior travel analyst, says places such as Cape May, N.J., and Key West, Fla., have great prices during the fall, as do major cities including Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego and the Washington, D.C., area. At the Heritage Inn in Cape May, rates drop from $250 in July and August to $125 starting Sept. 15, says Mark Bednar, the inn's front-desk manager. With the kids back in school, fall is the ideal time for adults to visit Orlando. You get shorter lines at the theme parks, better golf tee times and some perks for foodies. Walt Disney World is hosting the Epcot International Food & Wine Festival near Orlando Sept. 27 to Nov. 11, says Sarah Gavin, an Expedia

spokeswoman. Expedia was recently showing a hotel-and-air package for two people traveling Sept. 14 to 18 from Atlanta, Washington, D.C. or Chicago to Orlando, with a four-night stay at the Waldorf Astoria Orlando, for around $1,200. Deals can also be had at many of Florida's beach resorts. ShermansTravel.com is showing a one-bedroom suite at the four-diamond Marco Beach Ocean Resort, just south of Naples, for $139 a night on select weekdays in September and October. You get a less-crowded beach, golf courses and the Everglades nearby. New Orleans is holding the Louisiana Seafood Festival and the Crescent City Blues and BBQ Festival, running Oct. 11-13 and Oct. 18-20, respectively. Hotel rates in the Big Easy go down 20% to 30% in its off-peak season (August and September) from an April peak. Orbitz.com has a round-trip airfare from New York to New Orleans and three nights at the four-star InterContinental New Orleans for about $548 per person, for travel Sept. 26 to 29. The Caribbean and Mexico: If you're willing to take a chance on the weather (hurricane season lasts through the end of November) you can save hundreds of dollars on travel to the islands. In the Bahamas, you can get 20% to 30% off fall travel packages, says Ms. Gavin. Travelocity was recently showing a $1,267 deal for two people, including airfare from Chicago to Nassau and a four-night stay at the Wyndham Nassau Resort and Crystal Palace Casino Oct. 9-13. According to Priceline.com, round-trip airfare from New York and a seven-night stay at the four-star Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino, for travel Sept. 28 to Oct. 6, is going for about $1,036 per person. In Mexican destinations like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, you'll get a drop-off in prices and no rowdy college crowds. You also can enjoy festivals such as Mexican Independence Day on Sept. 16 and the Day of the Dead in early November. In Cancun, prices for Mayan temple tours and snorkeling often go down 10% to 20% during the fall, says Ms. Gavin. Expedia has a three-day package for two people for travel Sept. 22-25 from Atlanta to Cancun, with a stay at the Westin Resort & Spa, for $910. Go more off the beaten path and you'll find San Miguel de Allende, a town with natural hot springs and historic cultural sights three hours northwest of Mexico City. The Best Western Hotel Monteverde Express's website recently quoted a price of $70 a night. Europe:The continent is chock-full of fall festivals. There's the La Mercè festival, with concerts, parades and fireworks celebrating Barcelona's patron saint, in late September. From Oct. 18-27, Edinburgh hosts the famed Scottish International Storytelling Festival. Dublin has Arthur Guinness Day Sept. 26-27. And, of course, there's Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. These festivals are all the more enticing with cheap airfare and accommodations. For instance, you can fly from New York to Dublin and stay three nights at the Maldron Hotel Citywest Sept. 25-29 for about $714 a person, through Priceline. While Turkey was hit by protests earlier this year, the country is safe and still popular with tourists. Airfare and hotel rates for fall travel are often down 30% from the peak summer season, says Levent Artun, co-owner of Artun Travel in Chicago. Cruises:Cruise companies will often cut their prices for September and October by 40% to 70%, says Stewart Chiron, chief executive of CruiseGuy.com. On Carnival Cruise Lines' Carnival Breeze, an eight-night southern Caribbean cruise leaving from Miami, and making stops at Grand Turk, the Dominican Republic, Curaçao and Aruba, starts at $699 a person, according to CruiseGuy.com. Departure dates include Sept. 28, Oct. 26, Nov. 9 and Nov. 23. And due in part to the continuing economic woes in the European economy, Mr. Chiron says, there are good opportunities to cruise around Europe. A seven-night cruise on the Norwegian Jade—departing from Venice, Italy, and visiting Corfu, Santorini, Mykonos, and Katakolon in Greece—has rates of $499 to $779 per person with departure dates of Sept. 28, Oct. 12 and Oct. 19, according to CruiseGuy.com. (Airfare to and from Venice is extra.) Write to Daniel Lippman at daniel.lippman@wsj.com Email

Paulo Winterstein
Nov. 22, 2012 3:46 p.m. ET
SÃO PAULO—General Motors Co. on Thursday became the latest auto maker to raise concerns about investments in new plants in Brazil, saying too much domestic production could put a strain on profit.
