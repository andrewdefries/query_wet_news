The women came from neighborhoods all over the city, from Brooklyn to the Bronx. They were black and white, Asian and Latino. Many had blue-collar roots; some had dabbled in modeling and acting. They were competing for the most pedestrian of beauty titles: Miss Subways. The winner would get a black-and-white poster featuring her face—and a snappy summation of her life and aspirations—splashed on every subway car in all of the city of New York. Enlarge Image

Fiona Gardner Between 1941 and 1976, nearly 200 women were bestowed with the honor of what evolved into perhaps the most democratic of beauty contests. While initially the contest's winners were picked by the John Robert Powers modeling agency and the New York Subways Advertising Company, by 1963 the contest had become a public referendum, with city residents asked to send in votes for their favorite finalists via postcards. Peggy Byrne, then a 19-year-old from Brooklyn Heights working as an insurance company intern, had her turn in the spotlight in the 1950s. Enlarge Image

Miss Subways Maureen Walsh Roaldsen was a 23-year-old secretary at Downstate Medical Center when her poster went up in the 1960s. In her 40s, she would become a lawyer after attending night school at Brooklyn Law School. And Ellen Hart, owner of Midtown's Ellen's Stardust Diner, won in 1959. Decades later, she started a tradition of holding periodic reunions at her diner, whose walls are plastered with Miss Subways posters. "It was the 'American Idol' of the day," said Ms. Byrne, who now lives in Kips Bay and works as the manager of operations at a church. More than 35 years after the contest ended, the women will be remembered in an exhibit at the New York Transit museum that coincides with the release of a book, "Meet Miss Subways," chronicling their lives, past and present. The exhibit opens to the public on Oct. 23 and the book will be released in early November. Enlarge Image
Ellen Hart in 2007
Fiona Gardner Photographer Fiona Gardner made it her mission to track down as many Miss Subways as possible. Together with writer Amy Zimmer, she tracked down 146 posters and interviewed 41 Miss Subways all over the country. "The archives of the posters were completely lost and thrown away," said Ms. Gardner. "I kind of re-created that from scratch." What they found and chronicled was a history of working women in New York City. "If you look at the posters, it really sort of follows women's work in those eras and choices that women were making," said Ms. Gardner. Enlarge Image
Ellen Hart, Miss Subways March-April 1959
Miss Subways In the 1940s, women started working at manufacturing plants because so many men were away, serving in wars. In the 1950s, women's careers became more diversified, and by the 1960s and '70s careers included everything from nurses to real-estate agents to a pilot who flew planes competitively. The Miss Subways pageant was also ahead of its time. By 1948, there was already a black Miss Subways. A year later the first Asian Miss Subways was anointed queen of the underground. More minorities would follow. "It was the first integrated beauty contest," said Ms. Gardner. "There were about 11 African-American Miss Subways that I know about. Two Chinese women; a number of women were Hispanic, and there were a lot of Jewish women….It reflected to a large extent the New York immigrant population." Many of the posters had a "Mad Men" quality to them, doctored up by ad agencies run largely by men. Ayana Lawson

Miss Subways Enid Berkowitz (now Schwarzbaum) submitted her picture in 1946 because she had never seen an obviously Jewish name among the winners, according to Ms. Gardner. She won, but wasn't entirely thrilled with how her poster read: "Plugging for B.A. but would settle for M.R.S.," it said. Other posters were more somber. The late Elizabeth Stern's read: "Elizabeth was born in Warsaw, Poland—1939. She was reborn at Idlewild Airport on Nov. 15, 1959. A 20 year search by her father had ended. Painful memories of the Ghetto, a war and a long separation would fade. For now, Elizabeth has a father." Ms. Gardner said Ms. Stern's son learned from the poster that his mother was Jewish and a Holocaust survivor. It was something she hadn't talked about. For Donna De Marte, who was 23 years old and a secretary at CBS when she became Miss Subways in 1966, the contest was a brief, shining moment in the spotlight. The highlight for her was that it provided an opportunity to meet her idol, Frank Sinatra. Ms. Roaldsen, who still lives in Brooklyn, said the honor brought her to President Richard Nixon's inauguration and the "Finian's Rainbow" premiere, where she met Fred Astaire briefly. "Besides being a full-time secretary at Downstate Medical Center, Maureen puts her Barbizon School training to use by modeling at industrial trade shows and being a hostess at Shea Stadium," read her 1968 poster. "She's also won or been a finalist in other beauty contests." But Ms. Roaldsen's life, like those of so many of the other Miss Subways, included multiple careers that often ended far differently than the aspirations memorialized on the poster. She ended up putting herself through college and then law school when she was in her 40s, and she just recently retired after working as a lawyer for the state appellate court in Brooklyn. "It wasn't a beauty contest, it was a contest for New Yorkers," she recalled. "Practically everybody rode the subway and they felt it was theirs, and you were part of them." — sumathi.reddy@wsj.com Email

MOSCOW—French actor Gérard Depardieu
on Sunday received a hero's welcome—along with offers of a free apartment and a cultural minister's job—in a province known for its Soviet-era gulags. But the new Russian citizen, who earlier dined with President Vladimir Putin,
betrayed no signs of planning a long stay in Saransk, a sleepy provincial capital studded by drab Soviet-era apartment blocks and a massive television tower. He turned down the minister's job, but praised the hospitality he received in the city and waved his new passport to well-wishers. Enlarge Image
RUSSIAN DRESSING: Film actor Gérard Depardieu, wearing a local costume, shows his new Russian passport in the town of Saransk on Sunday, after he abandoned his homeland in a tax dispute.
Reuters Mr. Depardieu has sought Russian citizenship as he wages a public—and highly personal— campaign against the French Socialist government's plan to impose a substantial tax on high earners in France. The request was a propaganda coup for the Kremlin, and Mr. Putin granted Mr. Depardieu's citizenship request last week. Russian state-controlled television has given the actor fawning coverage as he traveled to Moscow last week to pick up his passport. Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted citizenship to French actor Gerard Depardieu. The actor had told friends he was considering moving to Belgium, Montenegro or Russia to escape France's tough new tax regime. Dow Jones's Lukas Alpert reports. Photo: Associated Press
Mr. Putin invited the actor to dine Saturday at his residence in Sochi, the host city of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Russian television showed the two men embracing and then chatting through an interpreter over dinner, where Mr. Depardieu praised Russian actors and discussed a film that was shot Russia in 2011 in which he plays Russian monk Grigory Rasputin. Russian state television reported that he visited Saransk because he is interested in playing the role of Yemelyan Pugachev,
who headed a massive peasant uprising against Moscow in the 18th century. During his tour of the city, Mr. Depardieu visited the local museum and historic buildings. Mr. Depardieu's trip has allowed the Kremlin to tout its flat 13% income-tax rate, which it hopes will entice wealthy Russians to declare their income and even draw some foreigners to Russia as well.

Getty Images France's Socialist government is attempting to raise the tax rate above income on €1 million ($1.3 million) to 75% from the current 41%. The country's highest court struck down the plan, but Budget Minister Jérôme Cahuzac said on Sunday that the government is reworking the law so the high earners will still pay an elevated rate, and longer than the two years initially imagined. Still the highly publicized flight of figures like Mr. Depardieu has the government worried. Mr. Cahuzac said the government isn't planning any more tax increases for the next few years as it tries to offer stability to companies and taxpayers following the exit of high-profile citizens. Mr. Cahuzac said between 600 and 800 wealthy French people leave the country each year, although he said the figures for 2012 will only be available in late 2013, after people have filed their tax forms. Mr. Depardieu's sojourn has helped poison feelings between Moscow and Paris, which has lately taken Mr. Putin to task for rising authoritarianism in Russia. On Sunday, French government officials mocked comments from Mr. Depardieu praising Russian democracy, and Green Party Paris counselors suggested the city name as honorary citizens members of punk band Pussy Riot, currently jailed in Russia. The affair could also deal a blow to the career of Mr. Depardieu, who has gained considerable weight since he won huge critical acclaim for his role in 1990's "Cyrano de Bergerac," subsequently earning him millions in big-budget Hollywood movies. He was lampooned in 2011 for urinating into a plastic bottle and on the carpet of an Air France

flight, forcing the plane to return to its parking spot. A fellow actor said Mr. Depardieu had tried to urinate in a water bottle when denied access to the toilet by a hostess, and was deeply apologetic and humiliated by the incident. Lately he has spent considerable time in Russia, including for the filming of the French-Russian film "Rasputin," and has been seen in television ads for ketchup and kitchen furniture. Beloved in Russia for his past roles in French films that were dubbed into Russian, he has lately aroused the ire of Kremlin opponents by praising Mr. Putin, whom he has called a friend. —James Marson in Moscow contributed to this article.

Updated Nov. 27, 2012 4:54 p.m. ET
Here's looking at you, kid. Students today react like audiences 70 years ago, endlessly humming 'As Time Goes By.'
Everett Collection For almost as long as there have been movies, there have been sequels. "The Godfather," "Star Wars," "The Lord of the Rings," the Twilight series—if there's anything Hollywood likes more than a blockbuster, it's the follow-up to one. Perhaps it's the dearth of original ideas or the desire among studios to cash in on a proven winner one more time (or two or three more times). So I can't say I was particularly surprised to learn, earlier this month, that there's talk of a sequel to that most storied of Hollywood productions, "Casablanca," which turned 70 on Thanksgiving Day. Despite several earlier attempts that ultimately got the ax, the new sequel is actually an old one, written sometime in the late 1980s by Howard Koch,
who shared the original film's 1943 Oscar for Best Screenplay with Philip and Julius Epstein. The script, "Return to Casablanca," chronicles the afterlives of the four principal characters. After making it safely to America, Ilsa Lund (originally played by Ingrid Bergman) and Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) attempt in vain to reconnect with resistance fighters Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and Captain Renault (Claude Rains) in North Africa. The script's main conceit is that Ilsa has a son from her relationship with Blaine and the boy grows up to be like his father, politically and otherwise. View Slideshow
'Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in "Casablanca." "Casablanca" is a film that has come to represent, possibly more than any other picture, our most fundamental understanding of what movies should be and how they can affect us, writes Noah Isenberg.
WARNER BROS / Ronald Grant Archi In 1989, six years before his death, Koch's idea for the sequel was rejected by Warner Bros. But Cass Warner, granddaughter of studio co-founder Harry Warner, onetime writing student of Koch and head of her own independent production company, Warner Sisters, is determined to have the sequel made, as she recently announced on her website. Whether or not "Return to Casablanca" ever gets made may be of less interest, however, than the fact that it is still being considered. Even this many decades after its release, "Casablanca" remains the go-to film for celebrations of Hollywood. It may not occupy the same mythical place it once did, but its mystique and cult status still endure. Teaching a seminar devoted to the film this semester, I've been pleased to see my students respond the same way that audiences have since the premiere at New York City's Hollywood Theater 70 years ago. They laugh when Peter Lorre sidles into Rick's Café; they get misty-eyed during the singing of the Marseillaise; they cheer on Rick when he aids the Bulgarian couple trying to secure coveted exit visas; they express disbelief when Ilsa boards the plane with Laszlo; and they endlessly hum "As Time Goes By." Amazingly enough, the film's composer Max Steiner, a Viennese-born musician who scored hundreds of Hollywood movies, was initially disinclined to use a popular song. Little did he know that his subtle, recurrent variations of the tune would sear it permanently in our collective imagination. "Casablanca" has come to represent our most fundamental understanding of what movies should be and how they can affect us. Practically every story line plays directly to our common humanity. There's personal sacrifice for the greater good in Rick's relinquishing of Ilsa, the love of his life. There's an ugly truth about the inevitability of moral compromise, embodied by the shifty Renault. And there is an honest look at the noble if unglamorous path of Laszlo, following his convictions. It is the stuff of messy reality in every generation. Then too, of course, there are the iconic performances. Although Bogart had already established his rugged screen persona in such films as "The Maltese Falcon" and "High Sierra," his portrayal of Rick offered a reprise with added complexity and vulnerability. Similarly, Bergman's Ilsa introduced the world to a stylish yet demure femininity—sex appeal without sex. I recently interviewed Leslie Epstein, son of "Casablanca" screenwriter Philip Epstein, and he suggested another factor that makes the movie a perennial favorite. The picture, he said, remains the "archetype of how Americans would like to think of themselves—as tough ('I stick my neck out for nobody') but underneath there's a heart and they do the right thing." It's an idea that is as potent now as ever before. Whether that makes "Casablanca" ripe for a sequel, I don't know. I'll leave that to the executives in the front office. —Mr. Isenberg, who directs the Screen Studies Program at the New School's Eugene Lang College, is working on a book about "Casablanca." Corrections & Amplifications An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that the Bulgarian couple in "Casablanca" were trying to obtain letters of transit. Email

TOKYO—In the week before he was killed in a hostage crisis in Algeria, Fumihiro Ito made plans to go see his mother in his hometown of Minamisanriku, a Japanese northeastern coastal city still recovering from a devastating tsunami in 2011. Mr. Ito was going to turn 60, a milestone birthday in Japanese culture. His friends were organizing a reunion party with more than 100 former junior-high-school classmates. He was excited to...

A soft-spoken party loyalist, Rep. Hal Rogers (R., Ky.) isn't the kind to rock the boat on Capitol Hill. But the 16-term lawmaker and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee delivered a tongue-lashing to Republican Party leaders last week and called for abandoning the budget-cutting tool known as sequestration, a lament that rang through the Capitol like a firecracker in a church sanctuary. Enlarge Image
Rep. Hal Rogers quickly came to believe conservatives wouldn't back the transportation and housing bill.
Roll Call/Getty Images He stepped out after a bill that would cut spending for housing and transportation programs was abruptly pulled from the House floor for what he said was a lack of support. Reflecting on the bill's collapse in an interview Friday, Mr. Rogers said it showed that many in his party don't have the stomach for the kinds of spending cuts the GOP promised when the House in April passed the budget crafted by Rep. Paul Ryan
of Wisconsin. "A good number of members who had supported the Ryan budget ideals, when it came time to implement it with specific cuts, were unwilling to support it," Mr. Rogers said, smoking a cigar in his corner office in the Capitol. "They abandoned ship." Mr. Rogers's outburst—he called proposed budget cuts "unrealistic and ill-conceived"—was a fitting send-off as Congress left town Friday for a five-week recess, leaving behind a budget and legislative process in shambles. More Conservative Bevin Aims to Topple McConnell in Kentucky Primary The major accomplishments of this session of Congress are few. The Senate, after advancing a bipartisan immigration bill and a flurry of executive-branch nominations, relapsed into partisanship when Republicans blocked a spending bill. Nerves were so frayed this past week that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) at one point called for his noisy colleagues on the Senate floor to "sit down and shut up." Most ominous of all, Congress hasn't approved—or come even close to enacting—any of the 12 appropriations bills needed to keep the government running after Sept. 30. It is common for Congress to leave big budget fights until the last minute, but the budgeting process now seems so adrift that even congressional veterans find it hard to see a resolution. "I have to ask myself, why am I even doing this?" said Rep. Jim Moran (D., Va.). "We don't have any leadership in Congress, and there is no consensus among the American people." Now, frustration is so high that even a team player like Mr. Rogers is breaking ranks. Mr. Rogers joined the appropriations committee in 1983, a time when federal spending was increasing annually and the committee was a bastion of power. The panel could build support for legislation—and reward its members—by dispensing money for local projects known as "earmarks." Mr. Rogers, who represents a rural swath of eastern Kentucky that is one of the poorest districts in the U.S., in 2005 was dubbed by a local newspaper as the "Prince of Pork." He became appropriations chairman after Republicans won control of the House in 2010, and by that time, the political winds were shifting. The tea party pushed to end earmarks, anti-spending fervor raged, and GOP leaders even took away the committee's prime office space, near the House floor. Programs that need annual appropriations, the part of the budget overseen by his committee, proved the easiest to cut, even though they made up only about one-third of the federal budget. That frustrated Mr. Rogers, because the fastest-growing part of the budget is in automatic spending programs such as Medicare. This year's House budget called for making all the cuts in domestic programs and none in defense. The transportation and housing bill, which would have cut programs from $48.4 billion this year to $44 billion next year, was the toughest test yet of Republicans' budget-cutting mettle. Mr. Rogers knew Democrats wouldn't vote for the bill. He also expected to lose support from some centrist Republicans, especially from the Northeast, who opposed cuts to Community Development Block Grants, Amtrak and other programs. But Mr. Rogers quickly came to believe he couldn't even count on conservatives, with some opposing his panel's bills because they didn't cut spending more. GOP leaders said that the bill was pulled from the House floor because of time constraints. But Mr. Rogers said the vote count was "bleak." After the bill was pulled, Mr. Rogers aired his frustrations in a meeting with House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) Wednesday, who listened sympathetically but offered no new budget strategy for the party. "I understand the frustration that they're dealing with," Mr. Boehner said later. But "the sequestration is going to remain in effect until the president agrees to cuts and reforms that will allow us to remove it." After returning from recess, Congress is likely to pass a stopgap funding bill to keep the government running while it grapples with a fiscal conundrum more far reaching than Mr. Rogers recalls seeing in a career that stretches back to the Reagan administration. "I don't recollect a time like this," he said. Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com Email

At one of Playboy's first big bashes after going private in 2011, much seemed as usual for a brand that has embodied American hedonism for nearly 60 years. Bunnies and Playmates sashayed beneath black crystal chandeliers in The Palms Casino's Playboy Club in Las Vegas, while men in suits hit the dance floor. From The Archives Playboy CEO Discusses The Future of Playboy
Playboy chairman and CEO Scott Flanders, who replaced 86-year-old Playboy founder Hugh Hefner's daughter Christie Hefner as the company's top executive in 2009, talks to WSJ's Lee Hawkins in an exclusive interview about the future of Playboy and the company's restructuring plans. (Originally published Nov. 29, 2012)

One of them was Scott Flanders,
55 years old, Playboy Enterprises Inc.'s first CEO outside the family of founder Hugh Hefner. But the appearance of the uninterrupted good life was largely an illusion. Mr. Flanders was in the early stages of radically reshaping the company, shrinking its staff by 75%, moving its headquarters from its historic home in Chicago to Los Angeles, outsourcing much of its business, and ushering in what many current and former employees describe as a harsher company culture. Mr. Flanders has been building on Playboy's recent strategy of morphing into a licensing company—in the process shedding the seedier aspects of its image. It remains a work in progress. "Our favorite line is, 'Less sweatsuit, more Tom Ford,
'" says chief marketing officer Kristin Patrick.
Today, Playboy is both smaller and more profitable. It now has annual revenue of $135 million, down from $240 million in 2009, the year Mr. Flanders came aboard. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization improved to $38.9 million for the year ended September, up from $19.3 million in 2009, the company said, but it fell short of a 2012 profitability target set by its lenders in loan covenants. Playboy sold its Spice channels and other TV and digital properties to Internet porn giant Manwin, and struck partnerships with art and fashion leaders like Dolce & Gabbana to try to reposition its brand as more aspirational. This winter, the company, long barred from Apple's digital storefronts because of its pornographic associations, will package a nudity-free version of its content together for the launch of its first iPhone app, featuring lifestyle tips, articles from the magazine and, of course, photos of beautiful women. Licensing revenue increased to $62 million in the year ended last September, from $37 million in 2009, according to people familiar with the matter. But the revenue stream is often uneven. Already Manwin has tried to renegotiate the $14 million it promised to pay Playboy annually because the digital and TV content isn't generating enough revenue, according to people familiar with the matter. A Manwin spokeswoman declined to comment. Playboy said that, while such discussions were initiated, it refused to accommodate a reduction of its minimum guarantees. Enlarge Image

Playboy also found itself in violation of its loan covenants in part because the Palms Casino's Playboy Club closed down, depriving Playboy of $4 million in annual licensing payments, according to people familiar with the matter. If Playboy misses its covenant again, Rizvi Traverse, the private-equity firm that led the buyout with Mr. Hefner, will have to kick in another $10 million, Playboy said. After negotiations with lenders, Playboy needs to show that it is on track to generate $47 million this year in Ebitda. But Standard & Poor's believes the new target will be hard to meet, warning recently it may downgrade the company's credit rating, saying Playboy "has performed below our expectations." The company has cut costs by $33 million over the past two years, in part by outsourcing and shedding much of its media business while still allowing Mr. Hefner to keep his contractually protected role as editor in chief of the magazine. Mr. Flanders has shrunk Playboy's staff from 585 when he arrived to 165 today, 65 of whom work in the famous Playboy Mansion where Mr. Hefner lives, as stipulated in the contract taking the company private. Once the most widely circulated men's magazine in the country, the namesake publication—which was losing about $12 million a year when Mr. Flanders took over—is printing fewer issues and copies to reduce expenses. Today, it loses about $6 million a year, Mr. Flanders says, although that red ink is offset by licensing fees from its 30 international editions. Some current and former employees grumble that the restructuring pain extends beyond the cost cuts, and that Mr. Flanders has created a difficult work environment, requiring employees to file regular reports to him detailing their conflicts with other employees in the company, and sometimes doling out verbal abuse. At the 2011 party, Mr. Flanders allegedly didn't observe the expected boundaries between a CEO and female employees, according to some current and former employees, who said he was hitting on Playmates and other young women. (Despite its freewheeling reputation, the company had what many former employees describe as a "zero tolerance policy" barring unwanted advances.) Afterward, a female employee filed a complaint with the company's human-resources department about alleged comments made by Mr. Flanders. Playboy's board investigated, and Mr. Flanders underwent sensitivity training, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Flanders confirmed that he underwent the sensitivity training but labeled "absurd" the allegation that he was hitting on Playmates. He said the regular reports were designed to get office conflicts "out in the open quickly" and solve them. As for the allegations of verbal abuse, Mr. Flanders said he came into a company that "required radical change financially, but also culturally," and that he had to tell employees "in very direct language" that "they were part of the problem." "I don't believe that I ever crossed the line into abuse, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't felt as abusive toward the recipient," he said. "Because it's my view that they were hearing this message for the first time." Some current and former employees say Mr. Flanders predecessor—Mr. Hefner's daughter, Christie, who served 20 years as CEO—ran the company with a culture of respect that stands in sharp contrast to the current company culture. But Mr. Flanders says Ms. Hefner rewarded length of service over performance. Ms. Hefner resigned in 2009, shortly after the stock hit a low of just about $1 a share. Jimmy Jellinek,
the editorial director of Playboy, said Mr. Flanders could sometimes be a "terrible SOB," but he's never seen him cross the line into unprofessional behavior, attributing the shift in company culture to the fact that the company went from being public to being backed by the "Wild West" world of private equity. Before joining Playboy, Mr. Flanders served as CEO of Freedom Communications, a newspaper chain partly owned by private equity that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a few months after he left in 2009. Before that, he served as CEO of Columbia House, where he also led a leveraged buyout of the company by the private-equity firm the Blackstone Group.

Acknowledging that Rizvi will be looking for a return on its investment before long, Mr. Flanders said Playboy would be "well positioned to pursue a public offering at the end of 2014." Rizvi Traverse executives declined interview requests, but the firm said it is "pleased with our investment in Playboy Enterprises," adding that "Scott Flanders and his team have made great strides in restructuring the company." Meanwhile, as the company prepares for its 60th birthday later this year, it has brought in a sexual anthropologist to help it make the content appeal to a generation that grew up with free pornography on the Web. It got a print redesign in 2012 with more modern photography and an emphasis on natural beauty. Holding up a mock-up of the magazine's March issue, Mr. Jellinek bragged, "There is not a single fake breast in this issue."

Wireless Firms Chase Push to Talk
By
Thomas Gryta
Nov. 23, 2012 2:30 p.m. ET
Competition is heating up among wireless carriers seeking to grab push-to-talk customers as Sprint Nextel Corp. enters the final stages of closing the legacy Nextel network purchased for $35 billion in 2005. Push-to-talk service lets users communicate instantly as they would with a walkie-talkie. The niche service, using so-called iDEN technology, is popular in industries such as manufacturing and construction, and Sprint is battling against Verizon Wireless and AT&T Inc. to hold on to such customers.

Watch a clip from "Hellenic Home Hunting," a new show about looking for bargains on the Greek real-estate market.
One morning in Athens, George Stroumboulis
huddled with Greek network television executives about his reality show starring home buyers looking for bargains in crisis-battered Greece. The show, "Hellenic Home Hunting," follows jet-setting prospects touring homes in search of the perfect pied-à-terre or villa. Filmed in English with Greek subtitles, it is one of the first shows of its kind for the network, which had yet to test the house-hunting niche already popular in the U.S. But there is a hitch: It isn't being shown in Greece. "Greeks in Greece don't care about it," Mr. Stroumboulis, a 31-year-old Canadian marketer, who is of Greek heritage, said during a January visit to New York. The show made its debut early this month on Greek TV network Antenna in North America, most of Europe and Australia. The show spotlights a stumbling block for the Greek housing recovery: Most locals lack the means to capitalize on bargain prices. With home prices falling roughly 40% since the Greek housing market's peak in 2008, prices are expected to continue to drop at least through the first half of this year, according to the Hellenic Association of Realtors. Some agents say price cuts can run as deep as 60% to 70%. Enlarge Image
A Canadian couple and agents look at a home in Stoupa, Greece, in an episode of 'Hellenic Home Hunting.'
Greek Property Exchange Mr. Stroumboulis says that selling prime real estate to foreigners isn't the same as selling out. He and his crew wore T-shirts throughout the filming that read, "Greece is not for sale, but its real estate is!" Reactions were mixed. During filming, onlookers at Athens's famous protest site, Syntagma Square, seemed understanding, if a bit guarded, he said, and interested most of all in getting their own homes featured on the show. "When it's lowball [offers] from Greeks within Greece, they're insulted, but when it's foreigners, we entertain offers," he said. Mr. Stroumboulis has never lived in Greece, but like many second- and third-generation Greeks living abroad, he sees the show as an effort to help the homeland while getting a good deal. Finding a dream villa is one thing. But buying it is another matter. "All the foreigners are hesitant, because, on the one hand, they think Greeks are con artists, and on the other hand, the bureaucracy is chaotic," said George Moutzouris,
an agent on Lesbos, an island in the Aegean Sea. Still, perceptions haven't stopped some foreign buyers. Helen Robinson,
a 61-year-old manager of a cattle ranch in Australia's North Queensland, said she briefly lived in Greece in the 1960s before political tumult forced her Greek father to move the family out of the country. Now she is looking to buy a four-bedroom villa near her father's village in southern Lesbos for €255,000, or about $340,000. Four years ago, the same home would have cost €100,000 more, said listing agent Dimitra Balkizas,
who guided Ms. Robinson on the show. Enlarge Image
George Stroumboulis
For those acquainted with reality shows of this sort, there are the typical tableaux: choosy buyers with picky criticisms perusing home after home for the perfect fit. But in the Greek market, there are some twists. In one episode, after commenting on the typical gripes about bedroom size in a contemporary home on Lesbos, Ms. Robinson turns to her agent, bemused: "The other thing that slightly worries me is the ruins, for want of a better word," she says, referring to an ancient-looking stone wall in disrepair in an adjacent lot. That, too, can be remedied, the agent says—the neighbor is willing to sell his plot. "Hellenic Home Hunting" also followed Sudha Nair-Iliades,
43, a magazine publisher, on her house hunt. She moved to Greece about 12 years ago with her husband, Stephane Iliades,
55, a third-generation Greek who works in private equity. Neither of them had lived in Greece before working there, but Ms. Nair-Iliades said she was taken by Athens's energy. "I like the craziness and the anarchy of it as well, which reminds me a little bit of living at home," in her native India, she joked. A longtime renter, she and her family recently closed on a roughly 1,300-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment in Palaio Faliro, a suburb in the south of the city. The eight-floor building, tall for Athens, overlooks the Port of Piraeus and the island of Aegina. The view is what sold Ms. Nair-Iliades, she said, but she also "fell for" the fireplace—a not very common feature in the temperate island nation. Much of the area was redeveloped around the 2004 Olympics, she said, and has many pluses, like a nearby promenade for long walks by the water. Other residents in the building include Spanish and Greek-American families, at least one of which is using the home as an investment property, she said. Real-estate agent Pia Vafiadou,
who isn't on the show, says a slightly larger home in the area now sells for about €450,000, down from almost €1 million four years ago. The show has backers at the network. It is a welcome addition, especially with the dearth of programming now being produced in the country, says Leda Papachatzi,
a programming manager at the network. And it is a chance to dispel some popular myths about Greeks. "The problem in Greece is not foreigners—we're not racist," she said. "Of course, we welcome foreigners." Ms. Nair-Iliades agrees. After raising two young children who speak French, Greek and English, and learning to speak Greek herself, she says she has never in her 12 years in the city felt unwelcome in Athens. "It's a country that depends so much on tourism, they actually appreciate the fact that we love it enough to buy," she said.

won federal approval Wednesday for its controversial plan to buy a suburban Chicago rail line, a purchase that would enable the company's trains to bypass a city notorious for its rail bottlenecks. The federal Surface Transportation Board voted 3-0 to approve the deal. But since the board's ruling doesn't become effective for 30 days, it remained unclear whether Canadian National can successfully complete the proposed transaction, which has been fiercely opposed by suburban residents worried about increased rail traffic in their communities.

, which owns the suburban Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway line, said in August that it "cannot agree to extend the agreement into 2009." The transaction can't be completed until the STB ruling becomes official on Jan. 24, 2009. A U.S. Steel spokesman declined to comment Wednesday, referring questions to Canadian National. Karen Phillips, Canadian National's vice president for North American government affairs, said the Montreal company remains "hopeful" that U.S. Steel will be willing to sell in January. The proposal has been a lightning rod almost since the instant in 2007 that the two companies reached the agreement. Canadian National, one of the largest railroads in North America, said it would buy the line for $300 million and spend another $100 million on infrastructure improvements along the tracks. In the past year, the company has also agreed to spend at least $60 million mitigating the increased noise and traffic that would come with additional trains rolling through the suburbs to the south, west and north of Chicago. Still, opponents, including a number of prominent politicians, have criticized the deal. On Wednesday, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois released a statement saying the STB "rushed a decision -- giving final approval on Christmas Eve -- for a project that has untold negative consequences on communities in our region and on quality of life for affected residents."
