By Juan Montes MEXICO CITY--Mexican stocks opened lower Thursday after the country's government released a weaker-than-expected economic growth outlook for the first quarter. The IPC index of Mexico's most-traded shares was recently down 95 points to 42169 points on volume of 22 million shares traded worth 620 million pesos ($51 million). The peso, meanwhile, weakened against the U.S. dollar to MXN12.1810 versus its MXN12.1415 close Tuesday. Local markets were closed Wednesday for Labor Day. Among Mexican blue chips in early trade, wireless carrier America Movil (AMX.MX) was falling 1% to MXN12.94, retailer Wal-Mart de Mexico (WALMEX.MX) was down 0.4% to MXN3850 and cement maker Cemex (CEMEX.MX) traded flat at MXN13.69. In its January-March report on public finances, Mexico's Finance Ministry estimates that gross domestic product grew around 1% in the first quarter, compared with the year-earlier period. If confirmed, it would represent a significant slowdown from the 3.2% growth rate registered in the fourth quarter, and the lowest expansion since the fourth quarter of 2009, when Mexico's GDP fell 2% due to the global economic crisis.

See one of Google's self-driving cars, which the Internet giant has been developing since 2009. While the self-driving technology won't be available for years, the company hopes such vehicles will revolutionize the way humans get around.
Marilyn Dondero Loop, a Nevada state assemblywoman, remembers being skeptical and concerned of possible dangers with self-driving cars when a Google Inc. lobbyist first approached her last year. But then Google introduced Ms. Dondero Loop, who chairs the assembly's transportation committee, to people who had ridden in its self-driving cars and showed her a video of one stopping when people crossed in front it.

More Lobbying for the Driverless Car What It's Like to 'Drive' Google's Robo-Car "That was an 'aha' moment for me," said Ms. Dondero Loop, whose committee later introduced a bill paving way for legalizing the vehicles on Nevada streets that was quickly passed into law in June 2011. Google has taken the same inspirational playbook to other states, working with a network of local lobbyists and in-house policy experts to woo legislators with demonstrations and rides in its exotic cars. It has scored legislative wins in Nevada, Florida and California, and there are now similar bills before lawmakers in Hawaii, New Jersey, Oklahoma and the District of Columbia. Google has been revving up lobbying efforts with legislators nationwide to build support of their proposed driverless car. WSJ's Amir Efrati reports on Google's efforts to pass legislation in support of autonomous vehicles in several states. Photo: Getty.
In the process, the Mountain View, Calif., company is building its credentials as an astute political operator. Google has been "pretty savvy" at navigating state capitols, said Frank Douma, a transportation-policy author and associate director at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs. With its self-driving cars, Google "knew what they were doing by moving forward in Nevada" before approaching bigger states, he said. "If you blow it in the first state, you've really got problems." Success at legalizing self-driving car technology has broader implications for Google. Skills learned from lobbying state lawmakers could aid other endeavors that will require local policy-making, including the potential expansion of its Google Fiber Internet and TV service into markets dominated by cable companies. Self-driving technology won't be available for years and it's too soon to tell whether robo-cars become a huge moneymaker for Google. But the state-level efforts are laying the groundwork for the expected creation of federal regulations governing autonomous vehicles, say people familiar with the technology. Overall, Google spent nearly $9 million in the first half of 2012 lobbying in Washington for a wide variety of issues, including speaking to U.S. Department of Transportation officials and lawmakers about autonomous vehicle technology, according to federal records, nearing the $9.68 million it spent on lobbying in all of 2011. It is unclear how much Google has spent in total on lobbying state officials; the company doesn't disclose such data. Leslie Miller, a Google public policy manager, said, "We don't have a diagramed, master plan" for passing self-driving car legislation nationwide. The goal is to establish "parameters of what would allow that idea to get to the market in a very thoughtful way," she said. Google began testing self-driving cars in 2009 under engineer Sebastian Thrun, who had previously worked on the technology with Stanford University faculty. Google co-founders Larry Page
and Sergey Brin
pushed Mr. Thrun to perfect the technology, which allows cars to drive themselves with the aid of lasers, cameras, and other gear. In most states, autonomous vehicles are neither prohibited nor permitted—a key reason why Google's fleet of autonomous cars secretly drove more than 100,000 miles on the road before the company announced the initiative in fall 2010. Last month, Mr. Brin said he expects self-driving cars to be publicly available within five years. Autonomous vehicles are safer than human drivers, and the technology could prevent accidents, help disabled people get around and reduce traffic congestion and gas consumption, he said.

are competing with Google to develop such technology. Enlarge Image
A Google self-driving car on the streets of Washington, D.C. in May.
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Google's Mr. Brin has said the company is looking to partner with automakers who could implement Google's technology and that it wasn't interested in manufacturing its own cars. However, a person with direct knowledge about Google's initiative said the company has considered being involved in manufacturing self-driving cars. Google's effort to make the cars legal began in 2010 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. There, Anthony Levandowski, an engineer on Google's car project, met with lobbyist David Goldwater and discussed the hurdles to legalizing the cars and how the bigger, more closely watched legislature in Google's home state might be a trickier place to start. Mr. Levandowski later agreed Google should give Nevada a try, partly because the state's aging population might benefit from self-driving cars and it was close to California, said a Google spokesman. In January 2011, Mr. Goldwater approached Ms. Dondero Loop and the Nevada assembly transportation committee about proposing a bill to direct the state's department of motor vehicles to draft regulations around the self-driving vehicles. "We're not saying, 'Put this on the road,'" he said he told the lawmakers. "We're saying, 'This is legitimate technology,' and we're letting the DMV test it and certify it." Following the Nevada bill's passage, legislators from other states began showing interest in similar legislation. So Google repeated its original recipe and added an extra ingredient: giving lawmakers the chance to ride in one of its about a dozen self-driving cars. "We had it going 70 miles an hour," recalls Jeff Brandes, a Florida representative who sponsored the state's autonomous-vehicle bill, which passed in April of this year. "It feels like it is a better driver than you are." In California, an autonomous-vehicle bill became law last month despite opposition from the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which includes 12 top auto makers such as GM, BMW and Toyota. The group had approved of the Florida bill. Dan Gage, a spokesman for the group, said the California legislation would allow companies and individuals to modify existing vehicles with self-driving technology that could be faulty, and that auto makers wouldn't be legally protected from resulting lawsuits. "They're not all Google, and they could convert our vehicles in a manner not intended," Mr. Gage said. But Google helped push the bill through after spending about $140,000 over the past year to lobby legislators and California agencies, according to public records. The company also touted the self-driving technology as a way to prevent accidents and save lives. "That has bipartisan appeal," said Alex Padilla,
a state senator who sponsored California's bill. Write to Amir Efrati at amir.efrati@wsj.com Email

Tense Negotiations Inside the Fed Produced Muddled Signals to Markets
By
Jon Hilsenrath
Oct. 7, 2013 10:34 p.m. ET
The Federal Reserve's decision to continue one of the most audacious experiments in monetary history—an $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program designed to boost growth—followed six months of tense negotiations inside the central bank, and a stumbling effort to let the public know what was going on. A small group of Fed officials has been privately pushing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to plan an exit from his signature program, said several people familiar with the closed-door deliberations. But glimmers of a weakening...

Bangladesh Police Charge Factory Owners
Factory Produced Garments for Global Manufacturers Including Wal-Mart
By
Syed Zain Al-Mahmood
Updated Dec. 22, 2013 6:49 a.m. ET
DHAKA, Bangladesh—Police leveled homicide charges against the owner of a Bangladeshi garment factory where fire killed 112 people last year—one of the most serious legal steps ever taken against an executive in the nation's powerful apparel industry. On Sunday, police said they had charged Delwar Hossain, managing director of Tuba Group, which owns Tazreen Fashions Ltd.—the plant where the fire happened more than a year ago—as well...

A Wall Street Journal Roundup Updated Oct. 12, 2013 11:20 a.m. ET
ROME—A Maltese ship brought 143 survivors from a capsized smugglers' boat to Malta while a search continues for victims. Italian Naval spokesman Cmdr. Marco Maccaroni said 34 people drowned after the boat capsized Friday afternoon in the Mediterranean Sea about 70 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa, just a week after more than 300 migrants died when their boat sank near the same island south of Sicily. Other survivors of Friday's accident were in good health still onboard an Italian frigate, which Cmdr. Maccaroni said also rescued 180 people from other boats in the same area overnight. Dozens of survivors awaited rescue after a boat carrying migrants capsized southeast of the Italian island Lampedusa. At least 34 people drowned. More than 300 people died when their boat sank near the same island south of Sicily about a week ago. Photo: AP
Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said Saturday that most of the migrants in the latest tragedy were fleeing civil war in Syria. A migrant boat capsized Friday off Malta. Above, an image from the search-and-rescue operation.
Armed Forces of Malta The boat was bound for Lampedusa, Malta's military said. Shortly after 4 p.m., the boat—which appeared unstable—capsized and "numerous" passengers were seen in the water, it said, adding a military aircraft provided initial assistance by dropping a life raft near the people in the water. A military patrol boat arrived about an hour later, it said. The island of Malta lies just over 115 miles from the accident, which took place in waters under the responsibility of Maltese authorities. The incident comes a week after the deadly sinking off Lampedusa. Thousands of refugees and immigrants try to cross the Mediterranean each year, often in barely seaworthy vessels. Earlier Friday, the death toll from last week's shipwreck off Lampedusa rose to 318 and was likely to increase further as divers widen the search in the coming days, the Italian coast guard said. "This is a new, tragic confirmation of what is happening in the Sicily strait," Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta
said in a statement following Friday's accident. The ship that sank last week set sail from Libya and carried an estimated 500 people, most of them refugees from Eritrea and Somalia. There are 155 survivors. Enlarge Image

Armed Forces of Malta/Associated Press Earlier this week, Mr. Letta said the country will hold state funerals at an unspecified date for the people who drowned. The incident pushed Italy to demand better coordination with other European Union members in dealing with the influx of African migrants, who are attempting to reach the country to escape from conflict and poverty in their home countries. The European Commission pledged an additional €30 million ($40.5 million) by the end of the year to help Italy deal with the immigrants landing on its shores. In a statement Friday, European Home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom called on EU member states to urgently boost funding for Frontex, the EU border agency. "In the aftermath of the Lampedusa tragedy we heard solidarity expressions from all EU countries, but these will remain only empty words if they are not followed by concrete actions," she added. The sinking on Oct. 3 hasn't deterred smugglers from bringing refugees into Europe from the Libyan coast, said Maurizio Albahari,
assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Notre Dame. "And it cannot possibly deter migrants who have gone through countless stages of peril and exploitation in their own country, especially in Syria and the Horn of Africa," Mr. Albahari said. —Matina Stevis in Brussels contributed to this article.

Walter S. Mossberg
January 26, 2012
As you read these words, millions of people are conducting video chats using the popular Skype service, now owned by Microsoft. Most of these calls are low-resolution encounters between two individuals, conducted over personal computers. This week, I tested a new device that aims to transform Skype video chats into room-size experiences, involving whole families or groups of friends on each end—seeing each other, chatting and sharing...

Gold's Fall Undercuts Newcrest's Savings Plan
By
Robb M. Stewart
Updated April 23, 2013 8:59 a.m. ET
Australian gold producer Newcrest Mining had troubles even before the price of bullion tumbled last week. The main issues are rising costs and production problems, including problems at a plant in Papua New Guinea that Newcrest acquired when it bought Lihir Gold for 9.5 billion Australian dollars (US$9.8 billion) in 2010. In the first three months of 2013, production costs ballooned 30% year-on-year to A$1,086 an ounce....
