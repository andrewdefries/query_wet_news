"So what are you saying? White women who voted for Romney consort with Klansmen?"
Nancy,
No. I am saying that the only grouping of women that didn't vote for Obama on a majority basis had to be some weird subset like sarcastically created one that I made up. It wasn't just minority women or your favorite group, single white females over 18; it was just about all of them. So according to your theory the majority of women, no matter how educated or accomplished, were overwhelmed by Democratic rhetori about abortion and contraception. So the personhood amendments that would ban most forms of hormonal birth control had nothing to do with women looking at Republican positions with alarm? And extrapolating a situation where women without birth control would be at risk of pregancy and subject themselves and there families to the rigors of extra unwanted mouths to feed did not trigger concerns? The incessant attacks on Planned Parenthood which supplies quite a bit of medical service to lower income women could not have given them pause about Republican positions?
And attacks on Obamacare which outlawed the rejection of a person who has preexisting conditions such as cancer or heart disease, did not rankle an awful lot of women? If you ask me, the only cogent position a women could have when faced with these espoused political position is the one that the majority of women came to. And that is not even considering the barbaric positions on rape or the invasive procedures called for by Virginia when a women requests an abortion. Some women think that it should be their call as whether they want to view a film of their uterus before the get an abortion. They don't think that it is anyone else's call. Republicans lost women nationwide by 12 points. By any measure that is a shellacking. with women composing 53% of the electorate , most pundits believe that you can't win with that kind of performance. And whether you like it or not, agree with it or not, the positions that women vote for are not unreasonable. Perhaps what should be examined is the stridency of your own position and that of the Republican Party. Is their some nuancing that should be considered on personhood that would guarantee that hormonal birth control could never be outlawed. An undercurrent of this is that most women know full well who was going to pick justices for the Supreme Court. They clearly did not trust Romney with this task. It really wasn't about Democratic demonization of Republican positions on womens issues. It was the postions themselves. You need to figure out how you can convince women that once pregnant that they are stuck. Or that morning after pills or even what passes for normal birth control is immoral because it disrupts a natural process (attachment). Or why Planned Parenthood is such a bad idea. Had Romney been convincing on these issues and not run away from them as if he was embarrassed, he might be President Elect today.

"I am saying that the only grouping of women that didn't vote for Obama on a majority basis had to be some weird subset like sarcastically created one that I made up ["consort with Klansmen"]."Greg,So that's what you think of women who didn't vote for Obama? Some "weird subset"? You call that respect for fellow humans? (I was going to use "tolerance" instead of "respect," but being tolerant carries with it looking down and using that word would let you at least partly off the hook.) You really don't get it do you, how insulting and combative that is? You can rationalize it until hell freezes over and it will still remain insulting and combative. How does that help move any dialogue forward?

But no dialogue, right Greg? Your way or the highway? And insulting people is okay, it's not about you, it is about "the problem," where those people are therefore indeed a "weird subset."See my prior comment again, you are so invested in your way that you jumped the gun. Oh, right, in your view a dialogue may deny you victory so it is indeed your way or the highway. You don't care for a better America, one where people respect each other and enter into a dialogue to resolve their differences, just your personal vision of better. I think I am beginning to understand.

Xavier,
My original post wasn't a presciption. It was an analysis. You guys are still in denial about what is happening. So you blame people and things that have nothing to do with the problem. My purpose is to call attention to that. My advice is to moderate. But as you have already indicated, that comes off a arrogant and pedantic. The electorate spoke. They deselected the extreme. That means you guys need to walk back your position. It's like the tax issue. When I hear Republicans say that we should use Mitt Romney's tax plan, I wonder if your party got the memo. You lost. The appropriate response should be "can we make Obama's plan more palatable to our constituency". But it is tricky sledding working through those stages of grief.

"The electorate spoke."
You mean all those folks whose registrations were shredded by government bureacrats trying to fix the outcome? I'm sure those folks were surprised when they showed up at the polling place and their names were not on the list and they couldn't vote thanks to dishonest Democrats.

Xavier,
I'm sorry I didn't sufficeintly genuflect to your position. But elections do have consequences. We saw that in 2010. Gerrymandering of districts to make them election proof. Anti -union and voter suppression laws out of the kazoo. Not a lot of compromise there. After months of Keith crowing about Obama's near certain firirng, low and behold the people agree with me. Your idea of an insult is apparently anything that doesn't agree with you. So unless I agree with you then you will continue to be insulted. Not much I can do about that. C'est la vie.

In 59 voting districts in Philadelphia, Ohio, Romney did not win one single vote. These are the same districts where GOP election monitors were forcibly removed by Democrat election officials.
How does it feel, America, to live in a country where the rule of law doesn't apply, and where the government party controls the election process to such an extent that it now merely "deems" its candidate the winner?
For me, it feels like I now live in the Soviet Union, under Putin.
Under a system like this, we might as well call republican candidates "the opposition candidate" like they do in those third world dicatatorships.

Or it could be in heavily African American precincts, Romney got bupkus. After all he was polling at zero nationwide for the African American vote. Obama received 93% of the African American vote but most of those that were dissatified went Green Party. Sorry. When you show up at the NAACP convention and throw red meat at your base, you can't expect very much in support from those that you purposely antagonize. Oh yea. The 47% remark didn't help.

Not likely, Greg. Not one vote out of 19,720 votes? Statistical chance of that happening, zilch, Just as it's statistically highly unlikely that in these same districts that there was higher than 90% turnout of all voters, even all the registered republicans who voted for Obama...
You certainly do have blinders on, don't you?
Voter fraud is just not an option...even when there is proof that 150 year old Democrats were voting absentee for Obama in South Carolina.
Systemic fraud was happening, and we need to take steps to stop it, in a fair way. One option might be to actually count heads coming through the plling place doors, and to lock up the boxes when voting stops. Then compare the number of ballots to the number of heads. If there is a large discrepancy, then demand a revote, or just disallow all the votes if they can't be determined true and legal votes. That way there is an incentive for communities to promote fair voting or their votes just won't count.

"You mean all those folks whose registrations were shredded by government bureacrats trying to fix the outcome?'
Keith,
Well then you have your own ineptitude to blame. Republicans were in charge of the state voting machinery in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia, and Nevada. If there is widespread voter fraud as you allege, then the buck stops with the Secretaries of State of these states. They spent their time passing voter suppression legislation which was generally overturned by federal judges. Come on. You guys lost by 3 million votes. If Romney thought he had a shot at making a voter fraud case he would. But his defeat was too convincing and thorough. In a word, it was an electoral college beat-down. It was so thorough that only you and Breitbart (who is dead) are thinking there is a problem. Again. C'est la Vie.

1/2Hi Lee,Getting back to your reply here: http://tiny.cc/rntonw "For the starter, I am not a preacher so stop telling me that I am preaching a sermon." --- I think you missed your calling Lee. But you don't have t/b ordained to preach, you put some preachers I’ve known to shame conviction wise. I would think that would be a compliment? You have been thoroughly indoctrinated to carry out the Great Commission; you can't be too ashamed to preach/proselytize for Jesus can you? You must do so shamelessly Lee! The moment a prospect convert senses shame in you, you lose them. I probably shouldn't encourage you tho! :-!http://tiny.cc/lmtonw "As a Christian, I was simply pointing out the absurdity in your claim that the best alternative you’ve found in place of God is Asian mysticism of sort and that somehow it can answer the ultimate question of what and why of our place in the universe is so ludicrous that it almost leaves me speechless." --- Almost??? :-P This goes back to arrogance in thinking you can know my heart Lee, or Wai Nang/Lao Tzu/Shakyamuni for that matter, barely knowing me/understanding them. As for answering the ultimate question of what & why of our place in the universe, you just answered that Lee! You Great Sage you! :-) I'm now on to better understanding the subtleties of why we think & believe all the crazy things we do. Why we manifest the differentiating clinging mind consumed w/ignorance & delusional thinking, driven by fear & greed, which defiles us. Nothing personal towards you Lee, it is a purely academic exploration.http://tiny.cc/uktonw "All your rants..." --- I'm not ranting Lee, asking uncomfortable questions sure, challenging firmly held myths & illusions most definitely, but ranting? Come now Lee, you know better, I'm not trying to convert or dissuade you of anything. Just trying to understand better why you think, believe & cling to the things you do."...remind me of the Bible verse, And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not proper; --- Yet another glaring design flaw in God's ultimate creation, eh Lee? Why a loving compassionate God created us w/reprobate mind incapable of, or disinclined to, "retain God in their knowledge"? Or forgetfulness in general! http://www.freeimagehosting.net/g3ucp"...you as an unbeliever, obviously lack the helpful insight from the Holy Spirit..." --- Fess up Lee! You're reading some third party exposition & attributing it to the Holy Spirit? I didn't just fall off the turnip truck yesterday ya know! ;-)http://tiny.cc/0xwonw "It was not because they could not, but because they were displeased with God, and chose to forsake him, and follow their own passions and lusts." --- That's a long walk on a short pier Lee. How can one be displeased/forsake that which they have never felt the presence of??? I don't chase after or cling to the phantoms of ancient story tellers anymore than I do contemporary ones. Lee, if you believe in golden plates, seerer stones & magic underwear, you might be a Romney! ;-) It’s apparently just a matter of degree of delusional thinking & how far one can run w/it. The fruit of conflating ancient supernatural mumbo jumbo w/morals & ethics to manage/civilize simpletons, heathens & barbarians?

Superstition & the clinging mind are a powerful combination. :-(http://tiny.cc/ejtonw "...nor even is it said that he arbitrarily abandoned them as the first step; but they forsook him, and as a consequence he gave them up to a reprobate mind." --- Same difference here Lee; you are parroting the same thing over & over.

The administration has been unclear, to put it charitably, about how it plans to regulate entire sectors of the economy. And it's killing jobs, hurting the middle class, and limiting the country's potential for growth. Almost daily, the administration announces new plans to unilaterally alter the legal landscape of American business, tweaking agency rules or coming up with new ones. Complying with...

Wintry Weather Cools Gasoline Prices
By
Konstantin Rozhnov
Nov. 3, 2011 4:53 p.m. ET

But higher refinery runs, boosted by a desire to produce more diesel and gasoil, will lead to extra supplies of other...

GOP Senator Would Offer Legal Status for Immigrants
By
Sara Murray
Updated March 19, 2013 7:23 p.m. ET
Republican Sen. Rand Paul laid out a plan Tuesday that would grant legal status to illegal immigrants and an eventual pathway to citizenship, a move that could bolster his national profile while irking some of his supporters.

Andy Kessler: When Interest Rates Rise, Watch Out
The Fed's inevitable Sword of Damocles could be brutal for bonds and stocks. Some of us recall the massacre of 1994.
By
Andy Kessler
Feb. 21, 2013 7:09 p.m. ET
