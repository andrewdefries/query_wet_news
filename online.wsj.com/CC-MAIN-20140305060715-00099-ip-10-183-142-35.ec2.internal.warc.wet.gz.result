Affymax Shares Fall as Customer Pauses Pilot Drug Program

   By Joseph Walker 
 Affymax Inc. (AFFY) shares fell sharply Thursday after the drug maker said a major customer will pause expansion of a pilot program using the company's anemia drug in dialysis centers. Fresenius Medical Care North America, one of the largest operators of kidney dialysis centers in the U.S., will stall the rollout of Omontys as it contemplates a long-term purchasing agreement for the drug, Affymax said in a regulatory filing. Some investors interpreted the announcement as a potential setback for Affymax as it looks to take market share from rival Amgen Inc. (AMGN). Analysts had predicted the pilot program would be expanded as Fresenius evaluated a long-term contract with the biopharmaceutical company. Fresenius said it halted the rollout because it had gathered enough information to make its decision, although doctors and dialysis centers can continue to use the drug if desired. Affymax shares fell as much as 33% Thursday but were recently down 3.4% to $16.34. Over the past year, the stock was up 54% through Wednesday's close. Omontys was approved last year as the first direct competitor to Amgen's blockbuster anemia drug Epogen, which is used primarily to treat fatigue and other symptoms in patients undergoing kidney dialysis. Amgen controls about 96% of that market but has been expected to steadily lose share to Affymax and other competitors after Epogen loses patent protection in 2015. Amgen shares recently added 13 cents to $85.07. In July, Fresenius entered into a contract with Affymax to use Omontys in a limited number of its dialysis centers as it evaluated the drug's safety and effectiveness, raising the possibility that the drug could become a permanent addition to Fresenius's treatment regimen. Fresenius has now treated 18,000 patients with the drug and will begin an analysis to determine what role it will play in treating patients, a Fresenius executive wrote in a letter to staff included in Affymax's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "We will now pause expansion of the pilot that began in late July 2012," Chief Medical Officer Franklin Maddux wrote. "We are now working to analyze the full set of efficacy and safety profile information and feel that the current scale of our experience with use of the drug is adequate to complete this analysis." Fresenius is a division of Germany-based Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. (FMS), shares of which recently fell 1% in the U.S. to $34.69. The letter noted that in some instances, Omontys can produce an allergic reaction also known to occur with Epogen. The side effect has been "infrequent" and "mild" for most patients, Mr. Maddux wrote, and the "vast majority of patients who are receiving the medication on an ongoing monthly basis are tolerating it well." The letter recommended that patients already receiving Omontys continue to receive the drug "as it has been providing effective anemia management." The letter also allows physicians and facilities that have been using Omontys to continue prescribing it for new patients, "as many of you have become quite comfortable with the medication." Christopher Raymond, a Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst, said in a research note that he expects Fresenius to expand its purchasing contract for Omontys and that a decision will likely come before its initial pilot program agreement expires in April. "We see this communication as nothing more than standard operating procedure and actually a strong positive signal," Mr. Raymond said. Mr. Raymond noted that the total number of Fresenius patients treated with Omontys was "much larger than we and, we think, most investors anticipated."

   By Nathalie Tadena 
 Time Inc. unveiled a reorganization of its editorial operations as it prepares for its planned spin off from Time Warner Inc. (TWX), bringing back its former editor-in-chief Norman Pearlstine to serve in the newly created role of chief content officer. The publishing company said current editor-in-chief Martha Nelson will leave the company with the reorganization, which eliminates the position of editor-in-chief and the current editorial reporting structure. The reorganization will decentralize editorial operations, with Time Inc. editors to report directly to the group presidents of their respective divisions. Mr. Pearlstine -- who currently serves at chief content officer at Bloomberg LP -- will have oversight of editorial policies and dotted-line responsibility for editors at Time Inc. Mr. Pearlstine served as Time Inc.'s editor-in-chief from 1994 through 2005 and joined Bloomberg in 2008. "As our business continues to face headwinds and we prepare to go public, it's imperative we develop a larger vision for what our brands can become," said Time Inc.'s Chief Executive Joe Ripp, adding Mr. Pearlstine has a deep knowledge of the company's editorial operations. Time Inc.'s spinoff from its parent into an independent company comes at a time of great uncertainty for the magazine industry. Magazines, like newspapers, have been hit by a shift of ad spending to the Internet. Time Inc. publishes some of America's best known magazines, including Time, People and Sports Illustrated. Mr. Ripp, a former finance chief of Time Inc., was named chief executive in July. Write to Nathalie Tadena at nathalie.tadena@wsj.com (Updates with additional background on Norman Pearlstine)

Prior to joining Bloomberg, he was a senior adviser to private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG), focusing on the media and telecommunications sector. He also worked at The Wall Street Journal from 1968 to 1992, except for a two-year period from 1978 to 1980, when he was an executive editor of Forbes Magazine. He served as executive editor, among other roles, during his time at the Journal.

JUSTICE TO INVESTIGATE IRS FOR TARGETING TEA PARTY Attorney General Eric Holder is testifying in Congress today after launching an investigation of the agency's targeting of conservative political groups. 2. EURO-ZONE RECESSION DRAGS ON Economic output contracted in the euro zone for a sixth-straight quarter, as a slight recovery in Germany failed to offset recessions in France and Italy. 3. US AMBASSADOR CALLED TO MOSCOW IN SPY CASE Russian officials detained an American on spying charges for the first time in a decade, charging a U.S. diplomat disguised in a blond wig tried to recruit a counterintelligence officer. 4.

SIMPSON TO SPEAK The ex-football star plans to testify today at an appeals hearing after not taking the stand at his famed 1990s murder trial or at the trial that ultimately sent him to prison. 6. EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON JOLIE'S MASTECTOMY Cancer experts said Angelina Jolie's decision to have a preventive double mastectomy should encourage women to look into their family history for breast cancer. But they cautioned against the need for all women to routinely order a genetic test. 7. ARIAS FACES DEATH PENALTY The Arizona jury that convicted her of stabbing and shooting her onetime boyfriend will hear evidence to decide whether she deserves a death sentence. 8. AMERICAN STARTS SENTENCE IN NORTH KOREA Kenneth Bae entered a "special" prison today to serve 15 years of hard labor for what Pyongyang called hostile acts, while Washington has remained silent. 9. HSBC PLANS COST CUTS HSBC, laying out its next three-year strategy, said it plans to achieve further cost cuts of $2 billion to $3 billion by 2016, including eliminating 14,000 more jobs. 10.
