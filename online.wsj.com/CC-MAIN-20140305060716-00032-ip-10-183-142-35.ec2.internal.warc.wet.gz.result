--Nymex gas recently 0.2% higher at $3.565/MMBtu --Gas futures gain as traders focus on cold temperatures --U.S. gas stockpiles data due 10:30 a.m. EST Thursday 
 
   By Jerry A. DiColo 
 NEW YORK--Natural gas futures were slightly higher Wednesday as investors weighed this week's bitter cold temperatures against forecasts calling for milder weather ahead. Natural gas for February delivery recently traded 0.7 cents, or 0.2%, higher $3.565 a million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange after trading lower earlier in the session. Temperatures have fallen to the lowest levels this winter across the U.S. Midwest and East Coast, raising demand for natural gas used to heat homes and businesses. But after rallying 14% from lows near $3.11/MMBtu earlier this month, traders are wary of big bets on further gains with weather forecasters calling for milder temperatures. The National Weather Service said earlier this week it expects above-normal temperatures across a broad stretch of the eastern U.S. over the next two weeks. On Wednesday, private forecaster Commodity Weather Group LLC predicted a "stronger warm spike" over the next six-to-ten days than in previous forecasts. "We're relatively flat because of these mixed outlooks. There's a cold burst now, but the outlooks for next week are looking much more neutral," said Matt Smith, an analyst at Summit Energy. Roughly half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating, and many more are heated with electricity from gas-fired utilities, making cold weather the primary factor driving gas futures in the winter months. But analysts and traders are also looking ahead to stockpiles data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration due at 10:30 a.m. EST Thursday. "Tomorrow's storage report will likely determine how the market finishes this week, assuming no dramatic changes in the temperature views," said Jim Ritterbusch, head of trading advisory Ritterbusch and Associates, in a note to clients. Still, the cold weather is leading to surging prices for last-minute purchases. Natural gas for next-day delivery at Transcontinental Zone 6 in New York traded at $39.50/MMBtu, up from $19.75/MMBtu. Natural gas for next-day delivery at the benchmark Henry Hub in Louisiana recently traded at $3.5350/MMBtu, according to IntercontinentalExchange, compared with Tuesday's average of $3.6275/MMBtu.

--Crude edges higher as traders weigh China data, oil inventories --Early indications call for draw in stockpiles this week --'Backwardation' could encourage crude draws (Adds Brent settlement and details about stock-market move.) 
 
   By Dan Strumpf 
 NEW YORK--Oil futures edged higher Monday, as traders weighed weak economic data out of China against the prospect of declining U.S. crude inventories. Light, sweet crude for August delivery settled 37 cents, or 0.4%, higher at $106.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange settled 28 cents, or 0.3%, higher at $109.09 a barrel. Futures spent the session swinging between gains and losses, beginning lower after data indicated China's gross domestic product in the second quarter grew by 7.5% versus last year, a slowdown from the 7.7% registered for the first quarter. But prices staged a recovery through the day, as attention shifted to the likelihood of another draw in U.S. oil inventories in data later this week. Oil inventories have already fallen more than 20 million barrels over the last two weeks, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, as the huge glut of oil trapped in the Midwest finally makes its way to market. "We're just treading water up here," said John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital in New York. "There's a bullish tone to the market." Oil futures also got a late-session boost from a higher U.S. equity market. Oil futures often take cues from equities, which are often seen as a barometer of broader economic sentiment in the world's biggest oil consumer. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index recently rose 0.2% to 1683.13. Oil prices have risen sharply this month, lifted by falling oil stockpiles and unrest in Egypt that has traders on guard for potential disruptions to global crude supplies. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said Brent crude has climbed almost $8 since June 21 on the back of reduced output among members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and recent unrest in Egypt. The bank said output has fallen in Libya, Iraq and Nigeria in recent months. Dow Jones Newswires reported earlier Monday that OPEC could cut production by half a million barrels a day when it meets in December, the first output cut in five years, as rising U.S. oil output eats into demand for its oil. Separately, market observers say a recent change in the structure of the oil market could spur further declines to inventories in the coming weeks. Recently, Nymex crude has become more expensive in the front months versus months later in the year. The phenomenon, called backwardation, can encourage holders of physical oil to sell their more valuable crude now rather than later. "Front-end barrels are worth more than back-end barrels," said Peter Donovan, vice president at Vantage Trading, a brokerage. "Why would I want to hold onto something until December if I could sell it [for more] in September." Front-month August reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, settled 1.46 cents, or 0.5%, lower to $3.1029 a gallon. August heating oil settled 0.33 cent, or 0.1%, lower at $3.0261 a gallon. More information on settlements and highs and lows for futures on Nymex and ICE platforms can be found by searching for the following headlines: 
 
   Nymex Light Crude Oil Close 
   Nymex Harbor RBOB Gasoline Close 
   Nymex Heating Oil Close 
   ICE Brent Crude Oil Close 
   ICE Gas Oil Close

Six of the nation's largest banks are about to line shareholders' pockets with $8.7 billion in new dividend payments this year. Minutes after the Federal Reserve privately notified some financial institutions that they passed a new round of regulatory "stress tests," a half-dozen sent out a flurry of statements Friday detailing the new payouts. Three more banks said they may raise dividends without specifying the amounts, likely providing another $3.4 billion for shareholders this year, according to research firms SNL Financial LC and RBC Capital Markets LLC. More Bank-by-Bank Guide on Payouts Fed Completes Stress Tests Document: Methodology for Fed's stress tests Fed Poised to Ease Its Grip on Banks Analysts Handicap Dividend Possibilities Topics: Dividends Vote: Will TARP be viewed a success? The day was a watershed moment for the U.S. banking industry. In giving the nod to banks, regulators freed them from strict oversight for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. At the time, the government forced banks to cut dividends and use the money instead to shore up their financial condition. Potential 2011 dividends of more than $12 billion, paid by just 10 banks, would dwarf the $4.5 billion in profits the entire industry posted in 2008. The Fed's move Friday to allow some banks to resume higher shareholder payouts also presented a clear division between the industry's strongest and weakest players. J.P.

The infusion was critical for Goldman at the height of the financial crisis, but it was costly. Goldman had been paying Berkshire interest of $1.3 million a day, or $15 a second. The Fed, though, isn't letting go of all control. It will continue to require banks to notify regulators of any planned dividends and share repurchases over a 24-month period. Banks will be able to make their own decisions, but regulators still can slap institutions with enforcement actions if they determine that banks aren't using capital wisely. The Fed was cautious Friday in what it allowed even the healthiest banks to do. The restoration of dividends won't return to precrisis levels, with the Fed limiting the payouts to 30% or less of anticipated earnings. J.P. Morgan Chase intends to pay out 20% of its earnings, raising its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share, up from five cents. That is short of the 38 cents a share the company paid as late as 2009. The first round of U.S. stress tests were introduced in early 2009 to determine how much of a cushion would be needed if a sluggish economy deteriorated. Those tests showed the 19 banks faced a total of $599 billion in losses over two years under the government's worst-case, Depression-like scenario. The Fed directed 10 banks to add a total of nearly $75 billion to capital buffers to insulate themselves from potential losses. In this second test, the Fed asked the banks to show regulators whether plans to unleash capital could withstand an 11% unemployment level, a 1.5% drop in the real gross domestic product, a 6.2% drop in an index of home prices and a 27.8% drop in equity prices. The new test "wasn't wimpy," said Gerard Cassidy,
an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. He said the Fed's metrics show that regulators still are concerned about the banks but also may be worried that restrictions could hamper their recovery. So, citing the relatively mild drop in GDP, for example, he said the test "wasn't extremely difficult either." But it also was clear Friday that even as some banks lag behind rivals, the Fed allowed them to claim some sort of victory as a result of the test. Regions Financial Corp.

Bob Sechler
Updated Jan. 18, 2013 9:11 p.m. ET
General Electric Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings rose 7.5% as the conglomerate said demand in China and other emerging economies offset an "uncertain" outlook in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe. Profit climbed 12% in GE's industrial businesses year earlier, and the company said orders for big-ticket industrial equipment and services edged up slightly after two quarters of declines.
