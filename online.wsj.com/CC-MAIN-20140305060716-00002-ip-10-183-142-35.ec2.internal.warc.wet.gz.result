By
Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.
Oct. 29, 2013 7:17 p.m. ET
The White House has issued a clarification. When the president said if you like your insurance plan you can keep it, what he meant was you can keep it if he likes it. Hundreds of thousands of Americans who are getting policy cancellation notices this month can't be as surprised as they pretend to be. President Obama made it clear at his 2010...

Hostess Union Clings to Hope
By
Rachel Feintzeig and Mike Spector Nov. 18, 2012 6:01 p.m. ET
The union that brought the 85-year-old baker of Twinkies and Wonder Bread to its knees is holding out hope that a buyer will salvage chunks of the company and send the union's members back to work, even as Hostess Brands Inc. gears up for a fire sale. Hostess, the company behind treats snacked on for generations, is poised on Monday to present to a federal bankruptcy judge a plan to shut down 36 plants and sell off the company's business. The liquidation was sparked by a nationwide strike orchestrated by the snack...

Many Avoid Tough Path to Citizenship
Many Eligible Immigrants Don't Attempt Naturalization; Cost, Exam Are Cited
By
Miriam Jordan
Updated March 4, 2013 1:28 p.m. ET
The move to overhaul the nation's immigration system has stirred controversy in part over the issue of offering citizenship to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. But judging by the last time the U.S. opened such a path for illegal immigrants then in the country, many fewer than 11 million likely would become citizens. After the 1986 immigration overhaul, fewer than half of those eligible became...

Worker Jose Arias hauls a bag of oysters at southern New Jersey's Cape Shore Flats last October. Harvests have improved since the 1990s.
Emile Wamsteker for The Wall Street Journal New Jersey was once home to a booming oyster industry, as evidenced by the Victorian mansions along Cape May erected by fishing barons and coastal communities such as Bivalve and Shell Pile that took their names from the plentiful natural resource lining Delaware Bay. "In the heyday, they were shipping 20 boxcars of oysters a day," said Douglas Fisher,
the state secretary of agriculture. Disease, overaggressive fishing and other factors eventually crippled the industry in the 1950s and again in the 1990s. But New Jersey oysters are rebounding through advances in growing techniques, increased demand and a new push from the state to drive economic activity in some of its poorest counties. Watch Video: From Consulting to Oyster Farming After harvesting an annual average of 36,600 bushels in the 1990s, fishermen had a banner year in 2011, when 95,000 bushels were landed, though that number dipped last year to 78,000. The industry is concentrated in the Delaware Bay, northwest of Cape May. The shallow bay's nutrients and water flow help make the oysters plump, sweet and briny, restaurateurs and oyster harvesters say. Other Eastern oysters are found in places such as Maine, the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, while Pacific oysters are harvested in Washington and Oregon. Much of the shellfish is bought by canneries and have yet to become menu mainstays, in part, restaurant owners say, because New Jersey's reputation has faded as a provider of fresh shellfish, even in its own region. "I've never heard of them," Rebecca Charles, owner of New York City's Pearl Oyster Bar, said of New Jersey's offerings. That reputation, however, may be changing. "Once people have them, they become fan favorites," said Krystof Zizka, co-owner of Maison Premiere in Brooklyn. "Unfortunately, there's some skepticism initially." Cape May Salts, a brand sold by large New Jersey producer Atlantic Capes Fisheries, are served in New York restaurants such as Maison Premiere and Telepan on Manhattan's Upper West Side. "These are perfectly balanced," said Bill Telepan, the restaurant's owner. "Customers will call me out and say these oysters were terrific." John Merendino, owner of Madison Seafood, a Newark wholesaler, sells as many as 3,000 Cape May Salts each week to high-end New Jersey restaurants, though that pales in comparison with the number of the better-known Long Island Blue Points he sells, about 20,000 weekly. Oyster harvesting generates nearly $4 million for local growers, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. Officials say oystering generates $20 million in economic activity—the ripple effects beyond direct sales. In the early 20th century, Delaware Bay produced more than a million bushels of oysters a year, but began tapering off in the 1930s and was down to 49,000 in 1960. Since the mid-1990s, with the introduction of a quota system that limits the amount of oysters that could be harvesters, the annual haul has rebounded to an average of 72,000 bushels in the past 10 years. In some ways, the most recent push for New Jersey oysters can be dated to the early 1990s, when the industry was struck by the parasitic shellfish disease known as Dermo, which didn't affect humans. "It was a crisis point. The industry was going to collapse," said David Bushek, director of Rutgers University's Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory, in Port Norris, N.J. Among the first actions: a quota system in 1995 to limit the harvest and ease the pressure the oyster fleet was putting on the dwindling population of shellfish. Next, New Jersey passed legislation in 1997 to develop shellfish aquaculture—a technique in which larvae are raised in nurseries, then transferred into the open waters to mature. With traditional harvesting, fishermen use large metal rakes towed by boats to dredge up wild oysters embedded along the bay bottom. Aquaculture techniques produce more uniform oysters, allowing growers to charge more for them on the half-shell market. The method also makes the industry less vulnerable to fluctuations in wild oyster populations and natural disasters. More recently, the federal government, along with Delaware and New Jersey, tried to improve the wild-shellfish habitat by dropping millions of clam shells into the bay, which helps oysters mature by giving the larvae something to attach to. Oyster aquaculture has "gone from an experimental phase to selling $1.4 million oysters thus far this year," said Brian Harmon, oyster farm manager of Atlantic Capes Fisheries, which for now sells Cape May Salts from Washington, D.C., to New York. That is up from $750,000 total in 2011. Oyster harvesters are cautiously optimistic about aquaculture. "It's been good for me," said Barney Hollinger, owner of Elder Point Oyster Co. of Port Norris, who started practicing aquaculture in 2007 after decades of wild fishing. "It's definitely keeping people in business and keeping people working." Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com Email

Some Detroit Bonds Hit by Bankruptcy Filing
General-Obligation Bonds, Considered Among Safest, Take Hit After Being Targeted for Cuts
By
Mike Cherney
Updated July 19, 2013 3:59 p.m. ET
Some Detroit bond prices fell sharply on Friday, as the municipal-bond market took a hit one day after the city filed the largest municipal bankruptcy ever. Debt tied to Detroit's retirement system traded on Thursday, before the city's bankruptcy filing, at 38.5 cents on the dollar, according to Electronic Municipal Market Access. On Friday morning, the bid price, or the price that a dealer is willing to pay for the debt, was...

Debt Makes Comeback in Buyouts
By
Matt Wirz
June 12, 2013 6:47 p.m. ET
Shareholders in BMC Software Inc. will receive $6.9 billion to sell the corporate-software developer to a group of private-equity firms. But the buyers, led by Bain Capital LLC and Golden Gate Capital, only intend to pay $1.25 billion in cash out of their own pockets. The rest will come from debt raised by BMC to finance its takeover. The little-noticed acquisition is another milestone in the return of cheap debt and higher-risk deals to Wall Street: The cash put down by BMC's private-equity buyers is the lowest as a...

Jim Harbaugh and Screech, his cousin, on 'Saved by the Bell: The New Class.'
YouTube NEW ORLEANS—In shepherding the San Francisco 49ers to their first Super Bowl since they won their fifth NFL championship in 1995, coach Jim Harbaugh has returned the franchise to its once-customary heights of greatness. But he's also managed to pull off a feat that isn't quite so transcendent: He's revived the memory of his brief acting career. Video Jim Harbaugh on 'Saved by the Bell' 49ers Coach's Secret to Football Success Fresh from leading the Indianapolis Colts to the AFC title game as their starting quarterback, Harbaugh in 1996 made a cameo on "Saved by the Bell: The New Class," a Saturday morning sitcom geared to teenagers. As the 49ers piled up victories this season, winning the NFC Western Division and advancing to Super Bowl XLVII against the Baltimore Ravens—coached by Harbaugh's brother John—online clips of Harbaugh's five minutes of screen time on the show went viral, igniting fascination with a quirky pop-culture moment that had long been forgotten. "People have been tweeting me. 'How was Jim Harbaugh? What was he like?'" said actor Dennis Haskins, who played the bumbling high school principal Mr. Belding on the show. "I thought he was really good." Enlarge Image
San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh made a cameo on 'Saved by the Bell: The New Class' in 1996. YouTube It's common, of course, for professional athletes to test their thespian chops on television programs. Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Namath played himself on "The Brady Bunch" and "ALF" and even pursued a career in Hollywood. Mets and Cardinals first baseman Keith Hernandez befriended Jerry Seinfeld in a famous two-part episode of "Seinfeld" and later nabbed a role as a ballplayer in "Law & Order." But Harbaugh's cameo stands out because he's since attained a higher level of fame—he actually had a losing record as a starting quarterback over his 14-year career—and because so many of the men he now coaches are familiar with the "Saved by the Bell" franchise from their childhoods. "We all grew up watching it," 49ers quarterback Scott Tolzien said. A gentle comedy that aired on NBC from 1989 to 1993, the original "Saved by the Bell" series was set at fictitious Bayside High School and chronicled the misadventures of six friends, including the aggressively dorky Screech, played by Dustin Diamond. One of its later iterations, "The New Class" ran from 1993 to 2000 and had a similar premise: Screech had become an administrative assistant at Bayside, and he and Mr. Belding were counseling a new clique of teens.

San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh with Screech, his less-popular cousin, on 'Saved by the Bell: The New Class.' YouTube In the episode "Little Hero," a young football player has cost his team a victory by doing a showboating touchdown dance before crossing the goal line. So Screech invites his "more popular cousin"—Harbaugh—to the school to impart some wisdom to the students about sportsmanship and humility. "Being famous does not make you a hero," Harbaugh says in the episode's final scene as he puts his right hand over his heart. "Being a hero isn't about what you do out there on the field. It's about who you are in here. It's about helping your friends, your school and your community." Carl Kurlander, who wrote the script, said that he had a generic football player in mind as he outlined the episode. But after Harbaugh accepted the invitation to come on the show, Kurlander was pleased to find that the inspirational speech he'd written for the character "seemed to really be who Jim was, and perhaps all that was good practice for him being a head coach and inspiring teams." In fact, according to Don Barnhart, the episode's director, Harbaugh set himself apart in an impressive way from most non-actor guest stars: He didn't use any cue cards to deliver his lines. "He practiced at home, I guess," Barnhart said, "between throwing footballs." Super Bowl XLVII Super Bowl Streaming Story NFL Playoff Dossiers NFL Power Shifts to the Players Snapshot of Sunday's Schemes 3 Ways to Watch the Super Bowl 49ers Have Intel Inside Football: Where Nepotism Works Video: WSJLive's Super Bowl Lineup Kurlander still keeps a copy of the script, autographed by Harbaugh, at his home in Pittsburgh. After watching the episode again recently, Haskins called actress Lindsey McKeon, who played the character Katie Peterson. The irony was that McKeon didn't remember working with Harbaugh at all—even though her boyfriend grew up in Indianapolis and is a rabid Colts fan. "Dennis said, 'You know, you're all over Twitter and the Internet with this Jim Harbaugh thing,'" McKeon said. "I was like, 'Oh, my God, that's the brothers in the Super Bowl!' I had no idea." For his part, Harbaugh said he's taken a good bit of ribbing from his family members, his friends and his players over his fleeting foray into show business. "They made quite a bit of sport of me," he said. "I was going to deliver a positive message to the youth, and for that, I have been thoroughly humiliated." Tolzien first saw the clip after Brian Jennings, the 49ers' long-snapper, showed it to him in November, and soon enough, Tolzien said, "it started moving its way around the locker room." Among Harbaugh's players, the reviews of his acting ability were lukewarm at best. "I'm glad he's good at coaching," Jennings said. "I don't think Hollywood was in his future." But Jennings did admit that he—or any other pro athlete in Harbaugh's position—probably would have accepted the challenge of performing alongside such small-screen heavyweights as Haskins, McKeon and Diamond. "It's fun to hold your belly and slap your knee at him," he said, "but if I had a chance to appear on 'Glee,' I'd take it. My hypocrisy only goes so far."

Judge Denies BP Bid to Freeze Oil-Spill Payments
Company Cited Potential Wrongdoing by Lawyers Working for Settlement Fund
By
Tom Fowler
Updated July 19, 2013 4:45 p.m. ET
NEW ORLEANS—A federal judge here denied BP PLC's request to freeze all payments from its oil-spill settlement fund while former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh investigates alleged wrongdoing by lawyers who worked for the fund. BP contended that two lawyers employed by the court-supervised fund appeared to be taking kickbacks from a law firm whose clients had filed damage claims over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon...

Updated Nov. 17, 2012 5:29 a.m. ET
A Palestinian picks through debris after an Israeli air strike on the building of Hamas's Ministry of Interior in Gaza City.
Associated Press CAIRO--Israel pummeled political targets throughout the Gaza Strip, including the office of Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh,
as the Israeli military continued preparations for a ground invasion. The overnight offensive came hours before Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafik Abdesslem entered the Gaza Strip Saturday morning, following in the footsteps of Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Qandil
Friday. After another night of rocket attacks into Gaza by Israel, WSJ's Matt Bradley reports Saturday, November 17th, from the destroyed Hamas cabinet office in the Gaza Strip. Via WSJ's #WorldStream.

Smoke rose from Hamas sites after an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City Saturday.
Ali Ali/European Pressphoto Agency More Coverage Battle Tests Effectiveness of 'Iron Dome' Defense System U.S.: 'Working Overtime' to Avert Invasion Gaza to Dominate EU Meeting Gaza Scrambles Obama's Mideast Calculus Cairo's Outreach Feeds Hopes in Gaza The parade of foreign dignitaries exposes the profoundly altered diplomatic contours since the "Arab Spring" of revolutions upturned an old order of U.S.-backed autocrats whom Israel could count on as reliable partners. But a ground invasion would drastically raise the stakes for a worsening conflict that has already stretched the Middle East's delicate diplomatic balance, even as the U.S. prods Egyptian diplomats to arrive at a negotiated truce. The decision by Mr. Abdesslem, like Mr. Qandil, to literally wade into the midst of fighting presents a bold--if symbolic--challenge to Israel's government. The political brinkmanship has diplomats worried that a new generation of Arab leaders, who are beholden to their voting publics for the first time, may feel compelled to take action against the Jewish state. The Israel Defense Forces reported in a statement Saturday morning that they had struck "over 200 targets" including "120 underground rocket launchers and more than 20 smuggling tunnels" on the coastal enclave's border with Israel, according to the IDF's website. IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Yoav (Poly) Mordechai said Israeli bombs had also struck Hamas's police headquarters and its homeland security building in Gaza City, the main city in the coastal Palestinian enclave. Enlarge Image

Getty Images The Israeli government is "continuing to amass forces for a possible ground invasion," the IDF reported. This came after Palestinian rockets struck near Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and as neighboring Egypt escalated its own war of words against Israel. Late Friday, Israel's cabinet approved the call-up of 75,000 Israeli reservists, more than doubling the number authorized the previous day. Heavy armor and soldiers from two elite brigades continued to mass at staging grounds on the Gaza border. A decision to launch a ground invasion could come within 24 to 36 hours if rocket fire continues, Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon
told CNN Friday. "They don't call up all these reserves to keep people standing in the stands watching," said a senior Israeli military official. "After rockets on Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, it's pretty hard not to" order a ground invasion. For three hours Friday, Mr. Qandil visited the Gaza Strip and stood hand-in-hand with leaders of Hamas, the militant and political group that rules Gaza. Israel had pledged to hold its fire during Mr. Qandil's three-hour visit. But rockets from the Palestinian territory could be heard taking off toward Israel, even as the Egyptian premier spoke to reporters. In Singapore, where Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is traveling on a trip to Southeast Asia, a senior U.S. official said Saturday that the U.S. is "working overtime" with countries in the Middle East to de-escalate the rising violence. Mrs. Clinton has been in touch with top officials in Israel, Egypt and Jordan in a bid to get Hamas to stop firing rockets on Israeli cities and to avoid the need for Israel to invade Gaza, the official said. "Every nation has a right to take steps" to end threats such as those Israel faces, said the official, who is accompanying Mrs. Clinton on the trip. "We are working overtime" with regional countries to allow the situation to de-escalate "so that decision [of an Israeli invasion] does not face us." "We believe that there is an opportunity to de-escalate if Hamas and those engaging with Hamas take the necessary steps to create a situation of calm—and stop firing rockets," he said. The emerging question in the latest conflict—which was sparked by a rise in Gazan rocket attacks on Israel earlier this month, and broke into the open when Israel assassinated Hamas's top military commander Wednesday—is how far Egypt's new Islamist government can extend itself on the behalf of its ideological allies in Hamas. Egypt is a peace partner of Israel. Its gasping economy depends on Western largess and its military is largely funded by the U.S. In recent days, U.S. President Barack Obama
has had several calls with Egypt's recently elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi,
aimed at bringing Hamas in line. During Friday's call, the White House said, President Obama commended Egypt's efforts to de-escalate the siguation. "Morsi's room to maneuver is very limited," said Ofer Zalzberg,
a Middle East analyst with the International Crisis Group. "He is dependent on the West. Everything he has done so far is pretty standard, not very different than what [former President Hosni] Mubarak would have done. Even sending the PM to Gaza, he declared that only after his conversation with Obama. So he's not out there acting unilaterally." If Israel's leaders give the order for a ground assault on Gaza, it would be the first such operations since 2009 and would plunge Israel's government into risky territory—risking soldier casualties and steep political fallout should the operation go awry, and jeopardizing its international backing. Israel's three-week ground war against Hamas in 2009 left more than 1,000 Palestinians dead, and destroyed entire villages and much of Gaza's infrastructure. Israel's image tanked internationally as it fended off war-crimes accusations.. Israel continued to hit the Gaza Strip with airstrikes and artillery shells and Hamas ramped up rocket fire at Israel, as both sides widened hostilities in the conflict's bloodiest escalation in four years. Charles Levinson has the latest from Tel Aviv on The News Hub.

On Mr. Morsi's orders, Mr. Qandil arrived in Gaza on Friday morning to demonstrate his new government's clear policy break from Mr. Mubarak's more-pro-Israeli regime. In a visit unprecedented for such a senior Egyptian official, he met with Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh before visiting wounded civilians at a crowded Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. See Related Video on #WorldStream Egyptian P.M. Hisham Qandil at Gaza Presser Palestinian Flags at Rally for Gaza in Tahrir Square Vendor Sells 'Jerusalem Is Ours' Pins at Tahrir Rally In a chaotic news conference at Shifa Hospital amid hundreds of reporters and blood-spattered doctors, Messrs. Qandil and Haniyeh blasted Israeli aggression and declared a new unified front against Israel. "It isn't a matter of individuals, not a matter of community. It is a matter of a nation. The Arab nation, the Islamic nation," Mr. Qandil said. "We are all behind you, the struggling nation, the heroic that is presenting its children as heroes every day." It remained unclear what message Mr. Qandil relayed to Hamas. In the days leading up to Wednesday's Israeli attack, Egypt was busily trying to broker a cease-fire between the combatants. A Western diplomat in Israel said the Israeli offensive had further angered Egypt's government because Cairo believed that Israel had feigned interest in the Egyptian-mediated talks earlier in the week as a diversionary tactic so that Hamas would let its guard down. The Israeli government remains confident that, despite the tough talk from Mr. Morsi's government, there is little risk that Egypt would do anything to undermine the peace treaty with Israel. "There's ongoing dialog and channels open between the defense establishments of Egypt and Israel," a senior defense official said. One of the missiles fired from Gaza during Mr. Qandil's visit set off sirens in Tel Aviv for a second straight day, followed by a loud explosion. Israeli police officials said the rocket appeared to have fallen into the sea off Tel Aviv. Another rocket, fired on Thursday, was intercepted by Israel's missile defense system. Later Friday, two rockets hit near Jerusalem, falling harmlessly in open areas, according to Israeli officials. The strikes on Tel Aviv and Jerusalem—the first ever for Palestinian rocket teams—underscored the significant upgrade to Hamas's weapons arsenal in recent years, which could also increase the costs of a ground invasion. Meanwhile, of the 75,000 Israeli reservists approved for call-up late Friday, 16,000 have been called. The military posted and emailed pictures of its elite paratroopers preparing equipment near Gaza's border. "A ground maneuver is a political decision," said Capt. Eytan Buchman,
an Israeli military spokesman. "But we're ready to carry out the order whenever it comes." If Israel halted its offensive now, even with a reciprocal cease-fire agreement from Hamas, the strikes on Israel's two most important cities would remain the enduring memories of the conflict and could allow Hamas to claim victory, the defense official said. Hamas officials accused Israel's air force of targeting Prime Minister Haniyeh's home Thursday evening amid a massive overnight escalation. Mr. Haniyeh wasn't there at the time, Hamas said, and it was unclear whether his home was in fact hit. If true, the accusation that Israel targeted a nominally elected top leadership figure in Hamas would mark a serious uptick in Israel's controversial "targeted killing" effort against Hamas leaders. Israeli officials denied targeting Mr. Haniyeh's home. By Friday evening, Israel's military said it had carried out over 500 strikes in Gaza. In a single hour early Friday morning, the military said it hit 70 different targets, mostly earthen pits militants use as launchpads in central and northern Gaza. Palestinian militants have fired approximately 600 rockets at Israel since hostilities began, including more than 150 Friday. Of those, 400 have struck Israel, but only 30 have hit urban areas, according to the military. Israel's newly deployed Iron Dome missile defense system has intercepted 180 urban-bound rockets, the military said. Israel's strikes have killed 28 Palestinians, about half of them militants, and wounded more than 270, according to Gaza health officials. Three Israelis have been killed in a single rocket strike on an apartment complex in southern Israel on Thursday. —William Mallard contributed to this article.

Twentieth Century Fox is refusing to accept about $23 million it is owed on Chinese box-office receipts for producing "Life of Pi" as a result of a clash between Hollywood and Chinese authorities, studio executives say. Enlarge Image
Hollywood studios are working to resolve a dispute with China. Pictured, moviegoers walk past a 'Skyfall' poster after the firm's premier in Beijing.
Associated Press The dispute centers on a new value-added tax that China is in the process of imposing on a wide range of goods and services. When it comes to movie tickets, state-owned distributor China Film Group has recently sought to deduct the cost of the tax entirely from foreign producers' share of the box office, said several people involved in international film distribution.

The tax method is causing consternation in Hollywood, where it is seen as the latest in a series of efforts to limit American studios' ability to generate profits in China despite a deal last year that was supposed to open doors. The policy undercuts one of the provisions of that agreement, reached between the American and Chinese governments, which bumped up the percentage of ticket sales that foreign producers receive. Executives from several studios including Fox are objecting to China Film's approach to dealing with the tax. In other countries, value-added taxes are taken out of gross box-office receipts, before the money is divided between studios and theaters. Studio executives believe China Film's new policy could reduce by 8% their theatrical revenue in coming years from the world's fastest-growing movie market, potentially costing them millions of dollars. "This is a serious concern and we don't know when it will be resolved," said one senior movie studio executive involved in the discussions. The new tax has created confusion for many businesses operating in China, legal experts say. When a pilot program was rolled out in select cities last year, officials didn't specify whether it would apply to movie tickets. This month the government stated publicly that it would apply to cinemas, beginning in August. But at a meeting of U.S. film studios organized by the Motion Picture Association of America last week, a senior executive from Fox told other international distribution professionals in attendance that China Film was attempting to reduce its payment on "Life of Pi"—released last year in China—due to the new value-added tax. Rather than accept what it believes is an underpayment, the studio is refusing to take any money until the issue is resolved. One movie industry expert in China said that due to the lack of clear rules, the amount of a tax any studio has to pay may depend on its ability to negotiate with China Film Group. The expert also noted that domestic studios are exempt from the tax unless they are working with foreign partners. Related Video Strings Attached in Disney-China Marriage A Message for the Next Wave of Chinese Filmmakers Cracking Into China's Film Market A spokesman for China Film Group declined to discuss to discuss tax-related agreements, but said he wasn't aware of any disputes with Hollywood studios. "China Film Group always has good relationships with foreign studios, so as far as I'm concerned, there is no controversy," said spokesman Jiang Defu.

, declined to comment. The MPAA has been involved in the dispute since last week's meeting, which was held at the Cinema-Con movie theater industry convention in Las Vegas. Studios and the MPAA are working to resolve the issue without involving the U.S. government. "I'm well aware of the issue," said Chris Dodd, the former U.S. senator who is CEO of the trade association. "We're working on it and the studios are." "Pi" was one of the most successful films last year in China, grossing $91 million. As last year's agreement allowed foreign producers to receive a 25% share of box office, Fox's share of the "Pi" box office should translate to nearly $23 million. China Film's imposition of the new tax would reduce Fox's take by approximately $2 million, according to people briefed on the situation. Executives at two other studios who attended the Las Vegas meeting said they agreed with Fox's position. They said they were concerned that if Fox accepted the lower payment, that could become a precedent that would impact the entire industry. American films that opened in China after "Life of Pi" and are awaiting their cut of box office grosses in the country include "Skyfall," released by Sony Pictures Entertainment, "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" from Time Warner Inc.

Warner Bros., Paramount and Disney declined to comment. Last year's agreement was seen as marking major progress in Hollywood studios' long-running effort to gain greater access to the world's second largest movie market-projected to be No. 1 by 2020. Aside from the increase in box-office share allowed for foreign producers, the agreement increased the number of foreign films allowed to play in China and share in box office revenue from 20 to 34. But a series of setbacks have followed. Last summer, China Film opened several similar movies, including "The Dark Knight Rises" and "The Amazing Spider-Man," on the same dates. It also imposed month long "blackout periods" during which no foreign pictures were allowed to play in Chinese theaters. Those moves were widely perceived as an effort to limit the total box office of imported films, which were far outpacing local productions. This year, the trend has been the opposite. Executives at Sony Pictures were shocked earlier this month when Chinese authorities pulled "Django Unchained" from theaters the day it started playing. The studio made minor changes to satisfy censors and on Friday said it would be rereleased in China on May 12. The Hollywood executives concerned about the new tax dispute said they are hopeful it will be resolved soon, but none expect to enjoy smooth sailing going forward. "China's China and there is always some issue," said one. —Lilian Lin contributed to this article. Write to Ben Fritz at ben.fritz@wsj.com and Laurie Burkitt at laurie.burkitt@wsj.com Email

is aiming to become more Chinese as it plans a rapid expansion in the country. Belinda Wong,
president of Starbucks China, said in an interview that Starbucks aims to roll out 800 new stores in the next three years to add to its existing fleet of 700. Over that period it will increase the number of employees to more than 30,000 from the current 12,000. Enlarge Image
The company aims to capture a larger market by going more local and applying its cultural insights, Ms. Wong said. For instance, whereas kiosk-sized stores work well in the U.S., where office workers grab bacon-gouda sandwiches to go in the morning on the way to work, Starbucks has learned that Chinese consumers value space and couches on which to relax in the afternoons. The coffee company is adding some stores that are nearly 3,800 square feet and can seat consumers who come with groups of friends and business partners. Starbucks also has discovered that Chinese tastes for coffee go only so far. It plans to introduce new Chinese-inspired flavors, building on existing favorites like red bean frappuccinos. Localization is a critical factor in the success or failure of foreign companies in China. Yum Brands Inc.

Starbucks has just eight branches in the Nordics, but this is all about to change. WSJ's John Stoll has the latest on plans to expand in the region.
Coffee Prices Fall, but Not at Starbucks Starbucks' New Cafes Serving Wine and Champagne The Case of the Missing Pumpkin Latte Starbucks's Ms. Wong said the Seattle-based company understands the complexities of operating in a country where consumers in smaller cities are just getting their first Starbucks and where established big-city coffee drinkers already need upgraded stores. The coffee company has recently hired local graffiti artists to redecorate one of its older stores in Beijing's popular Sanlitun Village, a shopping district that, like New York's Soho, attracts the young and wealthy and sparks trends. Starbucks is also coming to the realization that family expectations will have a big impact on its success. To retain its employees, whose parents would rather their children be working behind bank counters than serving up Sumatra, Starbucks earlier this year launched a family forum, inviting parents to hear testimonies from managers who have worked their way up the career ladder. "We don't do one size fits all," said Ms. Wong, noting that over the past two years Starbucks has opened a Chinese design center to build out its new stores and has launched a research and development center to fill the stores with sandwiches like the Hainan chicken and rice wrap or the Thai-style prawn wrap. The company is aiming to cater to noncoffee drinkers like Cheng Xiaochen, a 27-year-old English teacher who hates coffee but occasionally meets his students and business partners at Starbucks in the afternoon. "It's a good place to meet people," said Mr. Cheng. "But the coffee is so bitter it tastes like Chinese medicine." Mr. Cheng said he sticks to mint hot chocolate and looks for other sweeter flavors. China remains a tea-drinking nation, but coffee sales rose 20% in 2011 from a year earlier, reaching 6.25 billion yuan ($995 million), according to market research firm Euromonitor International. China is an important growth market for Starbucks, whose executives want the country to become its largest market outside the U.S. The company doesn't break out China sales, but executives said this month that China-based sales have increased 52% year-over-year. They didn't offer further details. Industry watchers say that although Starbucks has been successful in China, it faces challenges. Food companies from U.K.-based Whitbread

PLC's Costa Coffee to Korean SPC Group's Paris Baguette, are expanding rapidly across China, said Torsten Stocker, an analyst for consultancy Monitor Group. "All of these are not only fighting to increase their 'share of stomach,' but also for top real-estate locations and the talent to expand and manage their stores," said Mr. Stocker. Experts agree that corporate localization in China is crucial, as most consumers have culturally entrenched tastes that differ from Western ones. While China has an elite band of consumers who buy only foreign brands, the typical consumer is more parochial. Still, some caution that Starbucks can't veer too far from its Western image. "It's extremely critical to keep authenticity and consistency," said Vincent Lui, a partner of Boston Consulting Group. Such worries would be misplaced, Ms. Wong said, as Starbucks aims for the authentic experience. While Starbucks is planning to hype Chinese New Year more than ever this year, it has just rolled out its U.S. Christmas cups for the Chinese stores.
