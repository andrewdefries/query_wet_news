Jon Krause In the shadow of the economic crisis, financial advisers and investors are scrapping old notions about how to build a portfolio. And that has drastically changed the fates of two titans in the mutual-fund business. More in Investing in Funds Fund-Category Track Records Can Lie Look Abroad for Higher Stock Dividends Fund Fiend: When 'Go Anywhere' Investing Goes Awry Funds That Mimic Buffett's 'Moat' Strategy Read the complete report . Vanguard Group, now the largest U.S. fund company, has seen its fortunes soar as investors and advisers gravitate toward its signature offerings—index funds, including in the form of exchange-traded funds. But American Funds' star has dimmed as those same buyers shy away from its core stock products. Buying and holding stocks for the long run, a bedrock of investing for decades, is losing favor to more frequent portfolio adjustments as investors attempt to hold on to whatever returns they can scrape out of volatile markets. Many investors, rightly or wrongly, are simply fed up with stocks and are piling into bonds despite record-low interest rates. Shift in Strategy For many financial advisers, especially those at the big brokerage houses, gone are the days of claiming to "add value" for clients by finding market-beating fund managers. Instead, the firms are emphasizing smart shifts among different types of holdings. Enlarge Image
Jon Krause And they are gravitating to what was once unthinkable: getting exposure to desired segments through lower-cost index-based portfolios, often through ETFs. Vanguard Group, where founder John Bogle
popularized index investing for do-it-yourself investors, is reaping the benefits of its once-controversial push into ETFs—and an effort to woo financial advisers. Meanwhile, things at American Funds have been made worse by some disappointing performance at its stock funds and a shortage of attractive bond offerings. Vanguard, of Malvern, Pa., is bringing in cash in massive amounts. In just the first six months of this year, investors placed $58 billion with the 37-year-old firm, accounting for more than one-third of all new investments in mutual funds. Roughly 2,700 miles away, Los Angeles-based American Funds has seen 36 consecutive months of outflows, and over the past year the firm's assets under management slid 9%. Leaders Come and Go Such swings in investor favorites are no surprise to executives at Capital Group Cos., which manages American Funds. The firm, whose funds generally favor solid companies at reasonable prices, has seemed out of step before only to land on its feet. Enlarge Image
During the tech-stock bubble, American Funds managers largely sat out the frenzy, and investors shunned their funds. Then, during the 2000-02 bear market, all of the firm's stock funds posted positive returns. Investors took notice. In 2003, the firm set an industry record at the time with $65 billion of inflows. An additional $310 billion poured in over the next four years. When the financial crisis hit, several key American Funds offerings didn't live up to investor expectations that the firm would shield them from losses in a big bear market. "On a relative basis, the funds did outperform, but no one really cares when you're down 39%," says Kevin Clifford,
president of American Funds Distributors, adding, "We know that had we done a better job, the outflows would be smaller." In 2008, American Funds Growth Fund of America,
then the largest stock mutual fund at $117 billion, lost 39%. Since then, the fund has seen $63 billion in net withdrawals. More than half of the outflow came in 2011, as the fund continued to lag behind the competition. American Funds executives say the exodus also reflects broader dissatisfaction with stocks. "It's just people saying, 'Get me out of equities, stop the pain,' " says Mr. Clifford. Investors moving away from stocks toward bonds haven't had a compelling option at American Funds. Its largest bond offering, the $33 billion American Funds Bond Fund of America,
was hit hard by the financial crisis and is in the bottom 10% of its Morningstar category for the past five years. In an unusual move for the firm, Bond Fund of America's investment approach has been changed, along with its management. The fund now focuses more on high-quality bonds and less on credit-sensitive holdings. Performance has picked up, with the fund in the middle of the pack for the past three years. American Funds executives acknowledge the magnitude of the shift toward indexing. But they argue that the jury is still out on how much is secular and how much is cyclical. "If you're a major brokerage firm…and your clients didn't do so well, it behooves you to come up with something different to talk to your clients about," says James Rothenberg,
chairman of Capital Research & Management Co., the adviser of Bond Fund of America. He is particularly skeptical of the staying power of ETFs as a tool for tactical trading. That is just another phrase for timing the markets, he says, and history shows that consistently getting those calls right "doesn't happen often." And, of course, plenty of advisers still lean on the company's products. Lon Burford,
an adviser in Sacramento, Calif., has had clients with American Funds for the past 25 years. While he selectively uses ETFs, he's sticking with the fund company. "I have no idea which strategy is going to be the best for the next five years, but give me a 10-year scenario, and I'll bet those guys are going to do pretty damn well," he says. Surging Ahead Nevertheless, American Funds executives have explored offering ETFs. Bond ETFs "could be a down-the-road potential," says Mr. Clifford. For stocks, the transparent nature of today's ETFs likely makes them a nonstarter for the firm. The concern is that such openness would tip off the market to the firm's trading. However, the firm is intrigued by nascent efforts to build actively managed ETFs that shield daily buying and selling of stocks from prying eyes. "ETFs are here to stay, indexing is here to stay," says Mr. Clifford. "It's anything but business as usual around here." For executives at Vanguard, that sentiment is music to their ears. Starting in 2003, Vanguard's top executives, including now-president William McNabb,
saw an opportunity in the growing trend of brokers getting compensated through flat fees rather than commissions. A fixed fee would put the emphasis on lower-cost investments—and eliminate the disincentive to use funds from Vanguard and other companies whose funds don't provide commissions to sellers. For most of Vanguard's history, there was little love among such advisers for the company and its low-cost, do-it-yourself emphasis. Mr. McNabb jokes that in the past, the response to Vanguard calling on brokers would have been " 'Who let the evil empire in?' " The firm now has a sales force of about 200 people targeting advisers of all kinds, in "vigorous, active" fashion, says Martha King,
a 27-year veteran of the firm who heads Vanguard's adviser-services group. While Vanguard has actively managed funds with solid track records, such as Vanguard Wellington,
it is the firm's ETFs that are attracting advisers. About three-quarters of the money going into Vanguard ETFs is from advisers, Ms. King says. Mr. McNabb says it is fair to ask if Vanguard has made a risky move in courting brokers, since they may turn quickly on money managers if performance slips. What's more, Vanguard's reputation might take a hit if advisers put clients' money in investments that don't fit. But he and others say the firm's focus on investors' long-term results is intact. "It's up to us to work like hell to maintain that reputation," he says. Mr. Lauricella is a staff reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York. He can be reached at tom.lauricella@wsj.com. Email

Theater Chains Pricing for Slow Growth By
Martin Peers
Updated March 29, 2010 12:01 a.m. ET
Hollywood studios looking for a solution to weak DVD sales may have found an unexpected ally—movie-theater chains. Last week's news that some chains were raising ticket prices, most sharply for already costly 3D movies, will likely backfire. Not only is the economy still weak, but the array of cheaper home-entertainment options are wider than ever. Of course, seeing a 3D movie at a theater is a superior experience to watching...

Liberals complain that America isn't post-racial. But given how hard they work to keep race front and center in our national discourse, you get the sense that they wouldn't have it any other way. Two days after the nation's first black president was re-elected, there was a National Public Radio segment about all the racism that Barack Obama supposedly overcame to win a second term. One example was that Mitt Romney interrupted the president during a debate and told him to "wait your turn" to speak. Another...
