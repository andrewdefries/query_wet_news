In a low-interest-rate world, yield-hungry investors are turning to areas of the financial markets they wouldn't normally consider. The latest star: "preferred securities," or "preferreds" for short, which trade on exchanges like stocks and are priced like bonds. Enlarge Image
But there are so many variables to consider that finding value in the $500 billion preferred-stock market can be tricky, experts say. "There's a lack of definition in preferred securities," says Timothy Strauts,
an analyst at investment-research firm Morningstar. "It's a niche asset type that can make some sense, but most investors don't know the risks they are taking." Preferred securities are hybrids of stocks and bonds that are sold by brokers to institutional and retail clients. They offer much higher yields than investors can get in most stocks. As with common stocks, the dividends can be cut or canceled without notice. Like bonds, they pay higher income, and are safer than stocks in the event of a bankruptcy. The Standard & Poor's U.S. Preferred Stock Index yields about 6%, compared with about 2% for the S&P 500-stock index. Nine of the top 10 securities in the index are individual issues from financial firms, such as one issued by HSBC

in 2008 that yields 7.74%. The price for such high yields is complexity. Some preferred securities convert to common stock at preset rates; others don't. What's more, like bonds, most preferreds can be "called away" by the issuer after a certain amount of time on the market, meaning the investor must relinquish the securities. That is why investors tend to view them more like bonds than stocks. In fact, bond-rating firms Moody's Investors Service and S&P rate preferred securities.

yielding 6.4%, has added $472 million—24% of its current assets—over that period, according to ETF tracker IndexUniverse. Actively managed mutual funds and closed-end-fund firms are seeing more demand as well. Chicago-based Nuveen Investments, for example, just launched its fifth closed-end fund dedicated to preferred stocks, alongside a six-year-old, $822 million mutual fund. But preferreds expose investors to risks. The biggest: volatility, both in share price and dividend payments. During the financial crisis, the preferred stock index fell 63% from July 2008 to the market low in March 2009—worse than the S&P 500's 46% drop over the same time period.

exchanged preferred stock or suspended dividend payments. (Citi resumed payments in 2010.) Early callbacks can be another risk. The issuing firm holds a call option allowing it to redeem the securities at face value after a certain period, usually five years. That can produce unexpected losses for investors, says Nuveen portfolio manager Douglas Baker.
What's more, diversification isn't always easy. Most preferred securities are issued by banks and other financial firms. While such companies have no problem financing themselves when money is cheap, they can run into trouble when credit gets tight. Still, preferreds' high yields are rare these days. So what is the best way to play them? Experts suggest thinking small. Despite the higher yields, preferreds are risky enough that investors should devote no more than 5% to 10% of their fixed-income allocation to them, says B.J. Webster,
chief investment officer at the Wharton Business Group, a financial-advisory firm in Exton, Pa. Mr. Webster says he likes the iShares ETF's income, liquidity and relatively low management fee of 0.48%. For investors interested in actively managed mutual funds, several firms offer closed-end funds or traditional mutual funds. Some newer preferred-securities funds try to slice and dice their exposures finely. The Market Vectors Preferred Securities ex-Financials

ETF, tracking an S&P index of the highest-yielding preferred securities that meet certain liquidity requirements. A safer bet: buying a fund that ties preferred shares into the riskier, more aggressive selections in a total return fixed-income fund that manages across asset classes, not just preferreds. J.J. Schenkelberg,
an analyst at CLS Investments in Omaha, Neb., says her firm's core allocation model includes about 5% in preferreds. For an income-focused strategy, the allocation runs 10% to 20%. Just remember that plump yields come with many caveats these days. Buying in is easy; making the risks work in your favor is the hard part. Email

Departure of Ben Bernanke Could Produce a Feistier Central Bank

Jon Hilsenrath
Updated Aug. 18, 2013 7:25 p.m. ET
During nearly eight years running the Federal Reserve, Chairman Ben Bernanke's signature style has been managing by consensus. He has given colleagues wide latitude to speak their minds at closed-door Fed meetings and in public. He also has worked behind the scenes to find common ground among the 18 other strong-willed Fed governors and regional bank presidents when he has had to make big policy decisions. With Mr. Bernanke expected to give up the helm when his term ends in January, his leadership style, and the style of...

Hostess Union Clings to Hope

The union that brought the 85-year-old baker of Twinkies and Wonder Bread to its knees is holding out hope that a buyer will salvage chunks of the company and send the union's members back to work, even as Hostess Brands Inc. gears up for a fire sale. Hostess, the company behind treats snacked on for generations, is poised on Monday to present to a federal bankruptcy judge a plan to shut down 36 plants and sell off the company's business. The liquidation was sparked by a nationwide strike orchestrated by the snack...

Some Executives Hoped for Broader Reach
By
Damian Paletta, James R. Hagerty, and Sudeep Reddy
Jan. 1, 2013 11:37 p.m. ET
Some corporate leaders are relieved lawmakers reached a deal to avoid most of the fiscal cliff, but also bemoan a lost opportunity to reach a larger deficit-reduction package that could have shifted the focus of many corporations away from Washington's fiscal dithering. Business executives were glad Congress approved legislation Tuesday to avert the combined tax increases and spending cuts that likely would have triggered a recession....

For Small Oil Firm, Big Money in Saving Old Platforms
By
Daniel Gilbert
Updated March 29, 2013 8:10 p.m. ET
In 2011, a new charity started a campaign to save old oil-and-gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico that it said had become an underwater Eden for aquatic life, supporting communities of coral, algae and fish. These platforms also have the potential to leak petroleum, especially in hurricanes, which is one reason the federal government in 2010 tightened regulations that force energy companies to remove disused platforms.

SEC Nominee Signals Shift
Obama Taps Ex-Prosecutor Mary Jo White, Portending Increased Policing of Wall Street By
Jessica Holzer
Updated Jan. 25, 2013 3:12 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama nominated a former prosecutor turned white-collar criminal defender as his choice for top U.S. securities regulator. The nomination of Mary Jo White marks the first time a former prosecutor has been chosen to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission in its 79-year history. The move could signal tougher policing of Wall Street. Ms. White is the only woman to serve as U.S. Attorney for the...

SYDNEY—A powerful earthquake in the South Pacific triggered a tsunami that destroyed villages and killed at least five people in the Solomon Islands Wednesday, according to government and hospital officials. A wave measuring three feet reached the island chain after the quake hit around midday local time, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. The magnitude-8 quake, with a depth of 17.8 miles (28.7 kilometers), was centered about 220 miles east of the Santa Cruz Islands, part of the Solomon Islands nation, according to a bulletin issued by the U.S. Geological Survey. Enlarge Image
A magnitude-6.3 quake had struck minutes earlier in the same area, and there were at least three aftershocks measuring above magnitude-6 later in the day. An initial tsunami warning for the Pacific region was soon canceled. Official accounts of the extent of the damage in the Solomons remained vague hours after the fact, and a government official said communication with the worst-hit areas remained difficult. Among the affected areas has been the provincial capital of Lata, a city of about 2,300 in Temotu Province where hospital patients were evacuated to higher ground. Chris Roger,
a registered nurse at Lata Hospital, said by telephone that five deaths had been confirmed; one child, an elderly male and three elderly females. "Houses have been washed down, and the airport has been filled with seawater," said Charles Elliott Fox-Ngali, also a registered nurse at Lata Hospital who was reached by telephone. Loti Yates,
director of the national disaster management office in the Solomon capital Honiara, confirmed that the airport in Lata had been damaged by the tsunami and that logs and debris which had washed into the area by the wave were blocking the runway. Mr. Yates said four villages had been ruined, but he couldn't confirm any fatalities. Mr. Yates said a team of officials will be sent to the region early Thursday. "Some villages were inundated with saltwater … At this stage we have very limited information," he said. Conditions in Honiara were described as calm, although some residents had moved away from coastal areas as a precaution, said Chris Nemaia,
an official at the Solomon Islands Visitor Bureau. "People are already up on the higher grounds," he said. Christian aid organization World Vision, which is active in the affected region, said at least 100 homes had been destroyed in Lata and that power outages were widespread. Located in the Pacific's so called Ring of Fire—a volcanic region that stretches across the ocean—the Solomon Islands have been hit by strong earthquakes in the past, including a major quake in 2007 that left 52 people dead. James Goff,
director of the Tsunami and Natural Hazards Research Group at the University of New South Wales, said it will likely be some time before the extent of the damage becomes clear. "This part of the Solomon Islands is in a particularly active part of the boundary between the Australian and Pacific plates, and has seen a swarm of earthquakes recently," he said. —Arpan Mukherjee contributed to this article.
