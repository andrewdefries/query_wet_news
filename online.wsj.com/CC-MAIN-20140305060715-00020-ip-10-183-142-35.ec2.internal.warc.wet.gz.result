Stephen Moore: Why Lower Tax Rates Are Good for Everyone
If we want millionaires to pay more taxes, then we need an economy where there are more millionaires.

Nov. 15, 2012 7:07 p.m. ET
President Obama on Wednesday announced that any budget deal must include $1.6 trillion from higher taxes. "When it comes to the top 2%," he said, "what I'm not going to do is to extend further a tax cut for folks who don't need it." He argued that we are never going to get anywhere near balancing the budget without more revenue from people earning above $250,000 a year. He's probably right about that, though not in the way he intends. The country needs an economy that will create more of the "millionaires and billionaires" that Mr. Obama loves to excoriate, not more taxes from those who already exist. Total taxes paid by millionaires fell by almost $100 billion between 2007 and 2010, the last year with statistics available from the Internal Revenue Service. The drop resulted not from too-low tax rates, but from the severe recession and an anemic recovery since 2009 that thinned the ranks of the wealthy. Related Video

If Mr. Obama wants the Warren Buffetts and Justin Biebers to shoulder more of the nation's tax burden, he would do well to pay attention to the history of tax rates. Over the past century, lower rates have shifted the tax burden onto high-income earners and away from the middle class while maintaining the tax code's progressivity. Let's start with the 1920s. All tax rates were cut during the Calvin Coolidge
administration, including the top rate, which fell to 25% from the World War I high of 73%. Between 1923 and 1928, benefited by lower tax rates, the economy surged, raising incomes and living standards for the middle class. Tax collections in real terms nearly doubled—and the share of taxes paid by those who made more than $100,000 a year (more than $1 million today) increased to 51% from 28%. The top tax rate rose to 63% in 1932, to 79% in 1936, and to 90% during World War II. The higher rates persisted after the war, and while the economy grew as the government's economic role ebbed, high rates generally helped to hold back the pace of growth. Enlarge Image
Corbis Tax rates weren't reduced much until the Kennedy administration. JFK
cut rates by about 30% for every income group. He argued that the lower tax rates would "boost the economy, produce revenues, and achieve a future budget surplus." He even called lower rates "an investment in the future." The Kennedy tax cut was enacted in 1964 (after JFK's assassination), lowering the highest tax rate to 70% from 91%. His prediction that the economy would surge was validated by rapid growth every year from 1965 through 1968. Tax collections grew by 8.6% per year and unemployment fell to 3.4%. "The unusual budget spectacle of sharply rising revenues following the biggest tax cut in history," announced a 1966 U.S. News and World Report article, "is beginning to astonish even those who pushed hardest for tax cuts in the first place." Americans earning over $50,000 per year (the equivalent of about $250,000 today) increased their tax payments by nearly 40% after the rate cut, according to a report from the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Their share of overall taxes paid rose to almost 15% in 1966 from 12% in 1963. Americans with an income of more than $1 million nearly doubled their tax payments to $603 million in 1965 from $311 million in 1962. President Reagan cut all tax rates across the board in his first term, with the highest rate reduced to 50% from 70%. That was followed a few years later with the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which closed loopholes and lowered the top tax rate to 28%. The economy soared in the 1980s and the unemployment rate plunged after the mini-depression of 1978-82. Tax rates fell but federal revenues rose to $1.032 trillion in 1990 from $517 billion in 1980. Taxes paid by the wealthiest Americans facing the highest marginal tax rates increased every year during the 1980s expansion. Meanwhile, the share of total income taxes paid by the top 1% rose to 25% in 1990 from 18% in 1981. The wealthiest 5% of Americans saw their tax share rise to 44% from 35%. The surge in revenues was the result of prosperity that was largely spurred by tax-rate cuts. The increase in government deficits during that period, on the other hand, was due to higher federal spending. In 2003, President George W. Bush signed legislation that cut the top income tax rate to 35% from 39.6% and cut taxes on capital gains, too. Federal tax revenues surged by a record $780 billion from 2003-07, when the housing bubble collapsed. And once again, the rich paid more tax, not less. The share of taxes paid by the top 1% rose to 41% in 2007 from 35% in 2003. Tax payments by millionaires doubled from 2003 to 2007 because there were more millionaires and their before-tax incomes rose rapidly. It is also true that when Bill Clinton raised tax rates in the 1990s, the economy boomed and the share of taxes paid by the rich increased. But the otherwise depressive effect of higher tax rates was counteracted by the lighter burden of government on the private sector—federal spending declined to 18% of GDP in 2000 from 22% in 1993. A cut in spending is the economic equivalent of a cut in taxes now, or later. This point is effectively conceded by Mr. Obama demanding that his spending and borrowing binge of the past four years must be paid for by a giant increase in taxes over the next decade. Some liberals acknowledge these fiscal facts of life but argue that tax revenues from the wealthy increased simply because the rich got richer. And so they did. But the economic growth that was touched off by lower tax rates, particularly in the 1960s and 1980s, also benefited middle-class incomes and living standards. If Mr. Obama has his way and raises tax rates on upper-income groups, it will slow the economy, and everyone will lose. Mr. Moore is a member of the Journal's editorial board and the author of "Who's the Fairest of Them All?: The Truth About Opportunity, Taxes, and Wealth in America" (Encounter, 2012). Email

A Magician from Memphis
Moroccan craftsmanship was on its way to extinction when an unknown decorator arrived in Marrakech in the 1960s. Bill Willis revived the skills of artisans—and the crumbling homes of expats—with a glory yet unmatched. At Villa Oasis, home of Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé, Willis's talent shines undimmed.

REVIVAL ARTIST | Willis, shot by Andee Nathanson in 1967, when he first arrived in Marrakech with Talitha and J. Paul Getty Jr.
Andee Nathanson SOMETIMES THE SURVIVAL OF ancient skills hangs by a frail thread, springing to new life through the passions of one person whose vision inspires a surge of creativity. Such was the case with Bill Willis, Memphis-born and a longtime fixture of the sacred yet seamy quarter of Sidi Bel Abbes near the heart of the Marrakech medina. Morocco had almost forgotten its indigenous architectural and design history, until Willis's fresh eye came along to rejoice in its contrast of grand sobriety, rainbow palette and subtle variations on ancient Islamic themes. His disciples are legion, and echoes of his lively vision can still be found everywhere in his adopted country. Willis had arrived in Morocco in the mid-1960s after an adventurous decade that took him from the Stella Adler school in New York to England, then to Rome, where he opened an antique shop near the Spanish Steps that dazzled for a moment. Wildly handsome in a green-eyed shock-haired Irish fashion, Willis was orphaned before he turned 20 and blew his inheritance on a jaunt to Europe sampling every hedonistic rapture he could discover before his self-imposed exile to Tangier in 1966. In the following spring, his newly married friends, Talitha and J. Paul Getty Jr., arrived from Rome and swept him off to Marrakech—virgin territory for all of them. Photo: At Home in Marrakech

Photography by Oberto Gili Together they explored a city very different from the throbbing hub it is today. Only a few years earlier the power of France in Morocco had waned, and King Mohammed had returned to rule. The city was small, dilapidated—everything was for sale. The old palaces and riads of the medina were being abandoned by their owners for French villas in Gueliz—the suburb that consul general Hubert Lyautey had conceived of 40 years earlier. As the comforts of the modern world proved more seductive than their tumbling family palaces, their former courts and painted rooms were gradually invaded by rats, snakes and pigeons. “
In 1967, Talitha and Paul Getty arrived from Rome and swept Willis off to Marrkech—virgin territory for all of them.
”
THE INCOMPARABLE BEAUTY OF of the city's setting, with great palm groves to the north and the curtain of snow-capped High Atlas to the south, ravished the three friends as they searched for a holiday retreat. They eventually settled on the Palais du Zahir in the quarter of Sidi Mimoun, near the city's rosy southern ramparts, purchased from its exiled French owner for about 10 thousand dollars. Willis, who had already decorated the Gettys' apartment in Rome, was commissioned to reawaken this sleeping beauty. He felt instantly at home in Marrakech, exploring its dusty alleys, unearthing subtle evidence of its ancient culture and discovering craftsmen still working with skills harking back to its medieval past. One maalem (or master craftsman), in particular, opened many doors for the decorator: Ma'alem Houman, who was skilled in the brickwork and tadelakt (a glazed plaster mixed with pigment and soap) that Willis brought out of the hammam (or bathhouse) and into Moorish interiors. Houman would introduce Willis to masters of other crafts, including zellige (glazed tile mosaic), gebs (carved and incised white plaster) and mashrabiya (intricately carved cedar for pierced screens). Not all were local. For centuries, silver-bearded turbaned craftsmen from Fez and Meknes had been coming to work in the ancient mosques and palaces of Marrakech, instructing sloe-eyed youths in their arts. Willis soon discovered Jean Gallotti and Albert Laprade's Le Jardin et la Maison Arabes au Maroc, a magnificent book featuring Lucien Vogel's photographs of the finest work from the '20s and line drawings clarifying, with great precision, the techniques used—naming, for example, each tiny shape that creates the great sunburst of zellige. The Gettys' palace, with its four courtyards, ancient harem and great green-glazed garden court, still retained much of its 19th-century grandeur, as well as decorative traces from the '20s and '30s. Thus, learning a new design language, Willis worked his spell, knitting everything together with confidence, subtlety and gaiety. The Gettys' place sprung to life as Gore Vidal, Marianne Faithful, Michelangelo Antonioni, Dado Ruspoli, the Rolling Stones and Lords Warwick and Lichfield visited to bask in its sudden refreshment. Others, simultaneously drawn to this city of the plain, were soon lured by Willis and the Gettys from their medina hideaways to Sidi Mimoun, enticed not only by the charms of its inhabitants, but by the grace, wit and sparkle of Willis's décor, which became swiftly legendary. Among the very first were Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé, who sensed instantly that here was an artist of exceptional gifts and imagination. They were to become his most constant, loyal, supportive and creative clients—mentors and friends as well—working with him for over 40 years as they transformed their own kingdom around the Jardin Majorelle. Saint Laurent and Bergé had discovered their rundown corner of paradise soon after their arrival. The painter Jacques Majorelle had lived in Marrakech for more than 40 years until his death in 1962. Like his father, he was interested in decoration, but his great skill and passion was gardening, and here he created a garden with noble collections of palms, bamboo and cacti. “
Saint Laurent sensed instantly that Willis was an artist of exceptional gifts and imagination.
”
At first they bought Dar es Saada, a modest, neglected house next door to Majorelle's garden where Willis helped them make a holiday retreat with rooms for guests—simple, elegant, cool and welcoming. Later, in the early '80s, they bought the much larger Villa Oasis—Majorelle's own house—and, with Willis editing, enriching and echoing earlier work, created the richly wrought pleasure dome that became their home (Dar es Saada was converted to a guesthouse). From the marbled central hall, with its raised platform for musicians, rooms flow: on the right, the wondrous library and bedroom; on the left, the salon vert—its ceiling green and white; the salon bleu, with its shimmering fireplace and paintings by F.L. Schmied and Boutet de Monvel; a small dining room with bold flowering panels and a deep-scarlet steeply beamed ceiling; and out to the garden and the green-roofed pavilion that seems to float above the pools of water lilies. Everywhere the rich repertory of Moorish decoration is celebrated, using a surprising palette that at times echoes the freshness and gaiety of the surrounding garden; at other times—as in the ravishing library—applies more sombre, mysterious, crepuscular tones. Many people contributed to this astonishing creation—Jacques Grange to the furnishing; Messieurs Dominique and Filloucat, both of Marrakech, to the woodwork and the painting, respectively—but it was always Willis who interpreted, with boundless verve and imagination, the yearnings of his more fastidious, most favored and like-minded clients. This secret, beautiful world, consisting of two private houses and the public Jardin Majorelle, has been saved from extinction by the Foundation Jardin Majorelle, run by garden designer Madison Cox, Bergé's longtime friend and restorer of their gardens. “

”
WILLIS WAS CAPABLE OF working in many veins. In his own home—a fragment of a medina palace, its great room with a high-painted dome overlooking a desolate graveyard—his use of marble and zellige was spare. Elegantly detailed brickwork, tadelakt and painted wood boldly articulating the architecture were his private pleasures. He lived among fragments of antiquity and talismanic objects from primitive cultures, creating a setting for him alone—not especially comfortable for visitors, although he was an exemplary host, serving delicious food rather later in the day than most. Early in his Marrakech career, he built a little jewel of a house at Sidi Mimoun—all brick, at once graceful and robust. If you follow the western wall of the king's new palace, just past the Gettys' house (which is now owned by Bernard-Henri Lévy and his wife, Arielle Dombasle), there it is, unchanged, at least outwardly. The interior was exquisite, and hopefully remains so. Willis was not enthusiastic about the concept of "progress." He found it coarsening, unappealing and preferred the city as he remembered it. So, as life rolled on, he spent more time at home listening to opera and watching tennis. He was not grieved that so many of his ideas had been hijacked by far less gifted architects and soi-disant designers, nor did he trumpet the truth that so much happening in modern Moroccan architecture and decoration had once flowed from his pen and his head of wild curls. Time and Jack Daniels took their toll, and he left home less and less. His interment in Marrakech's Christian cemetery (where he lies in the company of old drinking companions) was attended by several dignified Moroccan men representing the guilds of the city's craftsmen and builders. They came to show their respect and to honor the memory of someone who came from far away and made an extraordinary contribution to their work and livelihood. Email

Oct. 4, 2013 6:45 p.m. ET
In the words of a veteran investor, watching the U.S. bond market today is like sitting in a packed theater and smelling smoke. You look around for signs of other nervous sniffers. But everyone else seems oblivious. Yes, the federal government shut down this week. Yes, we are just two weeks away from the point when the Treasury secretary says he will run out of cash if the debt ceiling isn't raised. Yes, bond king Bill Gross
has been on TV warning that a default by the government would be "catastrophic." Yet the yield on a 10-year Treasury note has fallen slightly over the past month (though short-term T-bill rates ticked up this week). Part of the reason people aren't rushing for the exits is that the comedy they are watching is so horribly fascinating. In his vain attempt to stop the Senate striking out the defunding of ObamaCare from the last version of the continuing resolution, freshman Sen. Ted Cruz
managed to quote Doctor Seuss
while re-enacting a scene from the classic movie "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." Meanwhile, President Obama
has become the Hamlet of the West Wing: One minute he's for bombing Syria, the next he's not; one minute Larry Summers
will succeed Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve, the next he won't; one minute the president is jetting off to Asia, the next he's not. To be in charge, or not to be in charge: that is indeed the question. Enlarge Image
© Images.com/Corbis According to conventional wisdom, the key to what is going on is a Republican Party increasingly at the mercy of the tea party. I agree that it was politically inept to seek to block ObamaCare by these means. This is not the way to win back the White House and Senate. But responsibility also lies with the president, who has consistently failed to understand that a key function of the head of the executive branch is to twist the arms of legislators on both sides. It was not the tea party that shot down Mr. Summers's nomination as Fed chairman; it was Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren,
the new face of the American left. Yet, entertaining as all this political drama may seem, the theater itself is indeed burning. For the fiscal position of the federal government is in fact much worse today than is commonly realized. As anyone can see who reads the most recent long-term budget outlook—published last month by the Congressional Budget Office, and almost entirely ignored by the media—the question is not if the United States will default but when and on which of its rapidly spiraling liabilities. True, the federal deficit has fallen to about 4% of GDP this year from its 10% peak in 2009. The bad news is that, even as discretionary expenditure has been slashed, spending on entitlements has continued to rise—and will rise inexorably in the coming years, driving the deficit back up above 6% by 2038. A very striking feature of the latest CBO report is how much worse it is than last year's. A year ago, the CBO's extended baseline series for the federal debt in public hands projected a figure of 52% of GDP by 2038. That figure has very nearly doubled to 100%. A year ago the debt was supposed to glide down to zero by the 2070s. This year's long-run projection for 2076 is above 200%. In this devastating reassessment, a crucial role is played here by the more realistic growth assumptions used this year. As the CBO noted last month in its 2013 "Long-Term Budget Outlook," echoing the work of Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart
and Ken Rogoff
: "The increase in debt relative to the size of the economy, combined with an increase in marginal tax rates (the rates that would apply to an additional dollar of income), would reduce output and raise interest rates relative to the benchmark economic projections that CBO used in producing the extended baseline. Those economic differences would lead to lower federal revenues and higher interest payments. . . . "At some point, investors would begin to doubt the government's willingness or ability to pay U.S. debt obligations, making it more difficult or more expensive for the government to borrow money. Moreover, even before that point was reached, the high and rising amount of debt that CBO projects under the extended baseline would have significant negative consequences for both the economy and the federal budget." Just how negative becomes clear when one considers the full range of scenarios offered by CBO for the period from now until 2038. Only in three of 13 scenarios—two of which imagine politically highly unlikely spending cuts or tax hikes—does the debt shrink from its current level of 73% of GDP. In all the others it increases to between 77% and 190% of GDP. It should be noted that this last figure can reasonably be considered among the more likely of the scenarios, since it combines the alternative fiscal scenario, in which politicians in Washington behave as they have done in the past, raising spending more than taxation. Only a fantasist can seriously believe "this is not a crisis." The fiscal arithmetic of excessive federal borrowing is nasty even when relatively optimistic assumptions are made about growth and interest rates. Currently, net interest payments on the federal debt are around 8% of revenues. But under the CBO's extended baseline scenario, that share could rise to 20% by 2026, 30% by 2049, and 40% by 2072. By 2088, the last date for which the CBO now offers projections, interest payments would—absent any changes in current policy—absorb just under half of all tax revenues. That is another way of saying that policy is unsustainable. The question is what on earth can be done to prevent the debt explosion. The CBO has a clear answer: "[B]ringing debt back down to 39 percent of GDP in 2038—as it was at the end of 2008—would require a combination of increases in revenues and cuts in noninterest spending (relative to current law) totaling 2 percent of GDP for the next 25 years. . . . "If those changes came entirely from revenues, they would represent an increase of 11 percent relative to the amount of revenues projected for the 2014-2038 period; if the changes came entirely from spending, they would represent a cut of 10½ percent in noninterest spending from the amount projected for that period." Anyone watching this week's political shenanigans in Washington will grasp at once the tiny probability of tax hikes or spending cuts on this scale. It should now be clear that what we are watching in Washington is not a comedy but a game of Russian roulette with the federal government's creditworthiness. So long as the Federal Reserve continues with the policies of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, the gun will likely continue to fire blanks. After all, Fed purchases of Treasurys, if continued at their current level until the end of the year, will account for three quarters of new government borrowing. But the mere prospect of a taper, beginning in late May, was already enough to raise long-term interest rates by more than 100 basis points. Fact (according to data in the latest "Economic Report of the President"): More than half the federal debt in public hands is held by foreigners. Fact: Just under a third of the debt has a maturity of less than a year. Hey, does anyone else smell something burning? Correction: Net interest payments on the federal debt are about 8% of revenues. The Oct. 5 op-ed "The Shutdown Is a Sideshow. Debt Is the Threat" misstated the payments as a percentage of GDP. Mr. Ferguson's latest book is "The Great Degeneration: How Institutions Decay and Economies Die" (Penguin Press, 2013). Email

SEOUL—North Korea refused to allow South Koreans to travel to a jointly run industrial park inside the North, the latest form of pressure from Pyongyang as relations between the two nations remain tense. Enlarge Image

North Korea usually allows South Korean factory managers and delivery staff to travel to the park early each morning, and others to return to the South after spending the night in the complex. The South's Unification Ministry said the North notified it on Wednesday morning of its intention to ban staff traveling to the Kaesong Industrial Complex, which sits about 6 miles north of the border. Over 170 South Koreans were refused entry to the North on Wednesday. The North again blocked entry on Thursday morning, the ministry said. A ministry spokesman said the North cited the reason as the current "situation" on the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang made no comment about the move through its state media. South Koreans have been able to leave the complex. A total of 33 traveled back on Wednesday and over 200 planned to return on Thursday. Over 800 stayed overnight in the complex on Wednesday as tenant companies made adjustments to ensure operations at the plant weren't affected by the ban on incoming staff.

North Korea recently cut off a military telephone line used to coordinate traffic flowing into and out of the complex, but instead has used a separate phone line in recent days to allow goods and people to travel as usual. It wasn't clear whether the entry ban would extend beyond Wednesday. Each morning, South Korea makes a request to the North to allow in workers to travel to the park. The industrial zone opened in late 2004 and was a product of the first-ever inter-Korean summit meeting in 2000 between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il.
More than 120 South Korean companies employ about 53,000 North Koreans to make basic products such as shoes and bags. It is also a lucrative operation for the North: About $90 million in annual wages are paid directly to the North's government., and some of the companies based at the industrial park are among the biggest employers in Kaesong, North Korea's third-largest city.

During previous periods of inter-Korean tension, North Korea has threatened to close the project. South Korean workers were blocked from traveling to the complex for three days in 2009 as the North reacted angrily to annual military drills in the South, as it is doing again this year. But operations at the park have continued even as all other cooperation has been suspended after provocations by North Korea against the South, including two attacks in 2010 that killed 50 South Koreans. One South Korean factory manager who regularly travels to the complex said that his operations were running as normal on Wednesday but the entry ban meant he was unable to deliver raw materials or bring out sportswear worth about 200 million won ($178,600). The South Korean government provides insurance for most companies operating in the Kaesong complex, but any major disruptions to operations would hurt other small South Korean businesses in the supply chain. A shutdown of the complex could have a broader impact on the South Korean economy as a signal of heightened risk of armed confrontation between the two Koreas. "The Kaesong complex is always like a yardstick for some foreign investors when it comes to the geopolitical risk for their business on the Korean peninsula," said Cho Bong-Hyun, a senior research fellow at the IBK Economic Research Institute in Seoul.

AP While South Koreans were able to travel out of the complex and back into South Korea on Wednesday, the project presents a potential risk of hostage taking by the North if relations deteriorate sharply. A senior government official in Seoul said Tuesday that preparations have been made to deal with that scenario, but added it is considered highly unlikely. "Of course we have [a contingency plan for any hostage taking at Kaesong]. We hope these things don't happen. We are getting benefits but North Korea is getting more," said the official, who spoke on condition of not being identified. South Korea's defense minister said Wednesday that military action would be an option if needed to ensure the safety of South Koreans at the park. Relations between the two Koreas remain tense after the North said on Tuesday it would restart its only nuclear reactor to provide more plutonium for nuclear weapons. Pyongyang also has threatened attacks on the South, Japan and U.S. bases as it reacts to sanctions imposed on it for its Feb. 12 nuclear test and military drills in the South that continue to the end of this month. —Min Sun Lee and Kwanwoo Jun contributed to this article.

BALANCING ACT | Meriwether, navigating the Fox lot on her signature vehicle.
Photography by Darcy Hemley THERE'S A GIRL POWER PHENOMENON happening in Hollywood. As studio executives green-light a flurry of comedies by young writer/producers—such as Mindy Kaling
of Fox's The Mindy Project and Lena Dunham of HBO's Girls—Elizabeth Meriwether, the 31-year-old creator of the sitcom New Girl, has emerged as the most far-reaching talent among this new vanguard. Now in its second season, nothing has found the sweet spot of critical acclaim and high ratings quite so well as the Fox hit, whose fall premiere last year was the network's most-watched in a decade. A Day With Elizabeth Meriwether

It's likely that viewers first tuned in owing to the appeal of lead actor Zooey Deschanel. But in its sophomore season, New Girl blossomed into the rare show that enjoys both a mainstream fan base and a cult following. What started as a standard post-Friends ensemble revolving around four Los Angeles roommates—loosely based on Meriwether's early twenties—has found its footing with a unique comic voice that borders on the absurd without feeling out of touch. Raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Meriwether studied play-writing at Yale before moving to New York, where Fox (owned by News Corp.

, which publishes WSJ. Magazine) recruited her through a writing program. New Girl was only the third pilot she had ever written, the kind of lightning-strike success that's virtually unheard of in the entertainment industry. As a showrunner, she serves as the executive producer while also overseeing all the daily elements of bringing the show from the writers' table to the screen. Meriwether doubted whether she could helm a weekly show without any prior television experience but quickly adapted. "When you have to make a show every week, no matter what's going on in your life, you just figure out a way to make it happen," she says. Making it happen, for Meriwether, means approving every wardrobe choice, making sure every joke lands and sitting with the editors for every cut. There's nothing resembling Hollywood glamour in her day, which often begins before dawn and stretches into the late hours—with food and showers an afterthought. But during those long spans at the writer's table and behind the camera, her quirky, unvarnished charm, easily recognizable to any viewer of the show, shines through—Hollywood's new girl, come to life.

Geoffrey A. Fowler, Tamara Audi and Derek Kravitz Updated June 26, 2013 11:09 p.m. ET
In cities across the U.S., Wednesday's Supreme Court rulings on gay marriage were met with an outpouring of emotion—and a few marriage proposals—among advocates for gay rights. Groups planned street parties at New York City's famous Stonewall Inn, San Francisco's Castro District and the West Hollywood, Calif., neighborhood near Los Angeles, after the high court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act and let stand a ruling...

Janet Hook and Damian Paletta Updated Jan. 21, 2013 4:48 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—House Republicans on Monday moved to extend U.S. borrowing authority until May 19, setting a timeline for the next phase of budget wrangling between the White House and Congress. The bill to extend borrowing, which was introduced by GOP leaders Monday and is expected to be approved by the House on Wednesday, would suspend the debt ceiling until May 19, allowing the government to issue new debt to pay existing bills. At the end of that period, the debt limit would be increased to reflect the new amount of total...

REUTERS WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court unanimously held Thursday that human genes cannot be patented, even when isolated from the body, a ruling expected to quickly expand access to genetic testing while potentially allowing inventors to retain rights to artificially created DNA. The decision marked the latest step in the court's decadelong march to toughen the requirements for patents. The justices repeatedly have declared that 21st-century innovation depends less on locking up intellectual-property rights than on expanding access to discoveries in order to spur further progress. The case involved two genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, where mutations can indicate significant likelihood of breast and ovarian cancer. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that human genes isolated from the body can't be patented, a victory for doctors and patients who argued that such patents interfere with scientific research and the practice of medicine. Jess Bravin reports.
Saving the Best for Last Three weighty issues -- voting rights, affirmative action and gay marriage -- are awaiting resolution by the High Court. They likely will be decided in a hectic final week of June. Here is a primer on the cases .

patented them and enforced its monopoly to control the market in genetic testing for the propensity to develop those cancers. The actress Angelina Jolie recently thrust genetic testing into the spotlight when she disclosed that she possessed the cancer-associated mutation, prompting her to undergo a double mastectomy. At issue was whether the genes, when isolated from the chromosomes in which they reside, are an invention, and therefore eligible for a patent, or a product of nature, which, regardless of the effort or expense involved in its discovery, cannot be patented. In an opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court followed the blueprint laid out by Solicitor General Donald Verrilli,
rejecting the views of both the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the specialized tribunal that hears patent appeals, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Justice Thomas credited Myriad for a "medical breakthrough" in identifying and isolating BRCA1 and BRCA2, which can foretell a 50% to 80% likelihood of breast cancer, compared with the average American woman's 12% to 13% risk. But, he continued, "groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy" federal law's requirements for a patent. In 1948, he observed, the court found unpatentable a product that combined several bacteria useful in improving soil-nitrogen levels, because the bacteria themselves were naturally occurring. Likewise, Justice Thomas wrote, "separating (a) gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention." And far from promoting innovation, as the company and its industry allies argued, allowing its patent to stand would frustrate progress. Enlarge Image
The decision should have "an immediate impact" on public health, allowing rival companies and laboratories to enter the market on genetic testing, said Harry Ostrer,
a physician at Yeshiva University's Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, N.Y. Researchers including Dr. Ostrer, as well as medical groups and patients, challenged Myriad's patents and were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union. "Costs should come down considerably," and greater competition should "improve the quality of genetic testing overall," said Dr. Ostrer. Myriad, in a statement, stressed the patent claims the court didn't invalidate, particularly for synthetic, or complementary, DNA created through gene splicing and known as cDNA. "We believe the court appropriately upheld our claims on cDNA, and underscored the patent eligibility of our method claims, ensuring strong intellectual property protection for our BRACAnalysis test moving forward," said Myriad Chief Executive Peter D. Meldrum.
Myriad charges $3,340 for its genetic test, which accounted for more than 80% of the company's $496 million revenue last year. Medical companies on Thursday were quick to announce plans for products testing for genes linked to breast and ovarian cancer after the decision. Beyond BRCA1 and BRCA2, Dr. Ostrer said the Supreme Court decision could invalidate patents for as many as 4,000 isolated genes, including ones that can help forecast the propensity for birth defects and heart conditions. The ruling means genetic testing 'costs should come down considerably,' and greater competition should 'improve the quality of genetic testing overall.' --Dr. Harry Ostrer, medical geneticist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who challenged Myriad's gene patents.
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images The director of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins,
said the ruling will make it easier to develop new combinations of tests and therapies "tailored to each person's unique genetic makeup." The Supreme Court long has held that "laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable," Justice Thomas wrote, for they are not themselves innovation, but rather the "basic tools of scientific and technological work." Allowing a company to tie up the building blocks of nature "would be at odds with the very point of patents, which exist to promote creation," Justice Thomas wrote. The court foreshadowed Thursday's decision in a March 2012 unanimous ruling that threw out two medical-testing patents and overruled the same specialized appeals court that had favored gene patents. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote at the time that the medical-test patents merely recited laws of nature and walked doctors through obvious steps. In Thursday's opinion, the court gave Myriad a small consolation prize by finding in favor of the patentability of cDNA, which typically is used for genetic engineering. "The lab technician unquestionably creates something new when cDNA is made," Justice Thomas wrote, with novelty among the essential elements of patentability. Still, a footnote gave Myriad little reason to cheer. Justice Thomas added that the court took no position on whether cDNA met the other requirements for a patent, such as being "nonobvious." He referred to a brief filed by the Obama administration, which observed that "given the prevailing level of knowledge in biotechnological fields, future patent applications directed to cDNAs and other synthesized DNA molecules may be rejected as obvious." Myriad shares initially rose sharply on the ruling but ended the day down 5.6% at $32.01 as investors reconsidered the odds that the cDNA ruling would help the company.

PARIS—French military forces joined Malian troops battling Islamist rebels in the West African nation, and Paris asked the U.S. to send drones to support the campaign, amid Western fears that insurgent groups with links to al Qaeda could destabilize the region and gain the ability to strike overseas. President François Hollande said Friday that French soldiers were intervening alongside the local army and other troops from Western African countries, at the Mali government's request, to help stop the progression of rebel...

President Obama
likes to talk about civility in politics, but then he has a particular personal talent for attributing to his political opponents only base motives and beliefs they don't come close to holding. Consult his Monday press conference for a classic of the genre. Mr. Obama was asked an anodyne question at one point about reducing the deficit and the long-term accumulation of debt, and perhaps you've noticed that the deficit is $1 trillion a year and the debt is building rapidly toward 90% of GDP. Mr. Obama acted as if solving this problem would be a pleasant stroll through a dewy meadow, claiming that "if we're trying to reduce the deficit, then we can shape a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit. . . . There's a recipe for getting that done." Good to know. And there are a few reasonable Republicans, Mr. Obama allowed. "But it seems as if what's motivating and propelling at this point some of the House Republicans is more than simply deficit reduction." Here's the rest in full: "They have a particular vision about what government should and should not do. So they are suspicious about government's commitments, for example, to make sure that seniors have decent health care as they get older. They have suspicions about Social Security. They have suspicions about whether government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat, or whether we should be spending money on medical research. So they've got a particular view of what government should do and should be." The next time Mr. Obama holds a press conference, somebody should ask him to identify by name those who want to repeal Social Security, steal food from orphans and cancel science funding. We'd like to meet these Visigoths. Otherwise, if the fiscal negotiations are going nowhere, perhaps it is because the President simply won't make an honest argument.

Sanne Ytting came to New York from Copenhagen 14 years ago, trained in music therapy and psychology. But when she started to miss the pickled herring of her native Denmark, she became a restaurateur. "I started wondering why there wasn't a place where I could introduce my friends to Danish food," Ms. Ytting said. "So I got the idea to create a little piece of Denmark in Manhattan."
