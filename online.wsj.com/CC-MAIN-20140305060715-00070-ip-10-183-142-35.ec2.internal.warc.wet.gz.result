Obama resaltará la agenda económica en su visita a México Artículo

Por THOMAS CATAN
CONNECTWASHINGTON—El presidente estadounidense Barack Obama buscará resaltar los recientes avances económicos de México cuando visite el país esta semana como parte de un esfuerzo para colaborar más allá de las drogas y el crimen. "Nos concentraremos mucho en la economía", dijo Obama durante una conferencia de prensa el martes. "Hemos pasado tanto tiempo en temas de seguridad entre Estados Unidos y México que a veces creo que nos olvidamos de que se trata de un gran socio comercial, responsable de enormes cantidades de comercio y empleos en ambos lados de la frontera".

El viaje de dos días —el cuarto de Obama a México como presidente— coincide con cambios en ambos países. El Congreso de Estados Unidos debate una reforma inmigratoria que, de aprobarse, podría eliminar una antigua fuente de fricción entre ambos países. A su vez, el nuevo presidente mexicano, Enrique Peña Nieto, ha lanzado una ambiciosa campaña para fortalecer la economía al inducir una mayor competencia en sectores como los de telecomunicaciones y energía y reformar el código tributario y la educación, metas que fueron esquivas por mucho tiempo para gobernantes anteriores. El Senado mexicano dio el martes el visto bueno final a la reforma de las telecomunicaciones. Los avances de México después de años de parálisis han provocado una ola de entusiasmo entre los inversionistas, lo que ha llevado a que el peso se aprecie más de 6% frente al dólar desde que Peña Nieto asumiera el poder, y los analistas ya empiezan a hablar de la llegada del "tigre azteca". "El momento escogido para la visita es excepcionalmente fortuito debido a lo que está pasando dentro de los dos países", dijo Arturo Sarukhan, quien fue embajador de México en Washington hasta enero y ahora preside la división de consultoría de Podesta Group. Más allá del optimismo, sin embargo, siguen habiendo tensiones en la relación bilateral. México, por ejemplo, está poniendo fin al amplio acceso que le otorgó a las agencias de seguridad de EE.UU. a sus contrapartes mexicanas para ayudar en la lucha contra el narcotráfico y el crimen organizado. Desde que asumió el poder en diciembre, Peña Nieto ha intentado mantener un mayor control de las agencias del orden en un esfuerzo por reducir la violencia ligada a las drogas que ha provocado la muerte de decenas de miles de mexicanos en los últimos años. Las autoridades dicen que estos cambios no dañarán la cooperación del país con las autoridades estadounidenses. Al aludir a estos cambios en su conferencia de prensa, Obama dijo que "no voy a evaluar cómo esto alterará la relación entre Estados Unidos y México hasta que escuche de boca de ellos qué es lo que están buscando exactamente". También hay interrogantes sobre si Peña Nieto podrá mantener la frágil coalición multipartidista que hasta el momento ha respaldado sus reformas. Ya se han producido manifestaciones por parte de los profesores la semana pasada en el estado de Guerrero en contra de los cambios a la educación que ha propuesto. Obama se reunirá con Peña Nieto el jueves antes de viajar a Costa Rica, donde se espera que se concentre más en temas de seguridad con los líderes de varios países centroamericanos. Se prevé que el mandatario estadounidense resalte que el progreso económico de México es positivo para el empleo en EE.UU. Se calcula que seis millones de puestos en EE.UU. están ligados al comercio entre ambos países.
El presidente también intentará promover la reforma inmigratoria estadounidense. Para conseguir el apoyo de los legisladores escépticos "se necesita mostrar a México de una manera mucho más positiva", dijo Ana María Salazar, consultora de seguridad en México que trabajó en la Casa Blanca y el Pentágono durante el gobierno de Bill Clinton. El progreso de México es evidente. Desde su crisis financiera en 1995, el país ha mantenido un crecimiento estable y se ha ganado una reputación de estabilidad económica y política. La economía ha crecido un promedio de 4,5% al año en los últimos tres años y algunos analistas dicen que, de fructificar, las nuevas políticas del gobierno podrían elevar su potencial tasa de crecimiento a 6% al año. Igualmente, la clase media de México se ha expandido ampliamente, haciendo que este mercado de más de 115 millones de personas se vuelva cada vez más atractivo para las empresas estadounidenses. Desde la firma del Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte hace 20 años, el intercambio comercial entre México y EE.UU. se ha más que triplicado en términos reales y ahora supera los US$500.000 millones al año.

When it comes time for a meeting, co-workers can be deadly. Discussions get hijacked. Bad ideas fall like blunt objects. Long-winded colleagues consume all available oxygen, killing good ideas by asphyxiation. When it comes time for a meeting, the office can be deadly. Long-winded colleagues consume all available oxygen and good ideas get killed by asphyxiation. Sue Shellenbarger explains on Lunch Break. Photo: Getty Images.
Co-workers wander off topic, send texts, disrupt decision-making or behave in other dysfunctional ways. Even the best leaders can resort to desperate measures to keep the discussion on track: chocolate rewards, Elmo dolls and ice-cold rooms. Multitasking at meetings is such a given that unless a leader sets a "no devices" rule or schedules "tech breaks," nearly everyone texts or sneaks a peek at email during meetings. And yet, that is nothing compared with real sabotage. Naysayers are the ones who "whatever you bring up, it will never work," says Dana Brownlee,
founder of Professionalism Matters, a corporate-training company in Atlanta. One of her strategies is to take serial naysayers to lunch before meetings to let them vent and try to reach agreement. Once the meeting begins, she sets ground rules, requiring anyone who complains also to offer a solution. Another problem personality is the silent plotter, Ms. Brownlee says. "They may be the quiet person sitting in back, but as soon as the meeting is over, they're over there by the Coke machine, planning your demise," she says. She makes a point of calling on plotters during meetings to try to draw out their feedback. And for the toughest offenders, ramblers, Ms. Brownlee sometimes puts an Elmo doll in the center of the meeting table and tells participants, "Anytime anybody in the session thinks we're getting off track, pick up the Elmo doll." This allows co-workers to express frustration without interrupting, she says. Brenna Smith
still talks about her big meeting victory. She was making a slide presentation to her new boss and 10 colleagues several years ago when, mid-sentence, a co-worker stood up and walked toward the front of the room, arguing that her ideas wouldn't work. To show that she could hold her ground, Ms. Smith says, she returned fire. "I think you're making a really good point," she told the interrupter, "but I want to finish what I'm saying first so we can talk about my ideas, and then we can talk about yours if we have time." View Graphics
Illustrations by M.K. Perker The room fell silent. The co-worker retreated to his seat. He never got time to make his case and her proposal was adopted, says Ms. Smith, founder and chief executive of SheNow.org, a website for women. More on Meetings Pants Required: Attending Meetings from Home People who ramble can be equally disruptive. Samir Penkar,
a Minneapolis project-management consultant, was running daily meetings among 20 employees at an insurance company last year when two participants kept taking the conversation off-track. So, he started bringing in chocolates. Whenever either "started their rambling, I handed them a chocolate," he says. He repeated the tactic six times over two weeks until the employees learned to stick to the agenda. To keep a meeting moving, leaders sometimes set aside time early in the discussion for naysayers to voice objections and challenges, and then direct the group to shift gears and focus on making a decision, says Patti Johnson, chief executive of PeopleResults, a Dallas-based career and workplace consulting firm. In a meeting she attended several years ago, co-workers were close to reaching consensus on a new project, Ms. Johnson says. Then, a senior manager blew it all up. "She asked a question that was almost impossible to answer," Ms. Johnson says. "It threw the speaker off balance." Several of the manager's 15 frustrated co-workers asked, "Why are you bringing this up at this point? Shouldn't you have raised this earlier?" she says. But the naysayer's objection was enough to stall the project—an outcome that seemed to please her. With advances in technology and an emphasis on efficiency, the office should be running more smoothly than ever. Meetings are supposed to be a time of creative problem-solving, where the best ideas emerge. Yet even some of the best managers can't seem to run them. The Quiet Plotter: CRIME: Practices passive-aggressive insubordination. MODUS OPERANDI: Remains quiet at meetings; later undermines bosses and decisions. LEVEL: First degree nuisance
M.K. Perker Office workers spend four hours a week in meetings on average—and they regard more than half of that time as wasted, according to a British study of 1,000 employees released last week by Opinion Matters, a London market-research company, for Epson, a maker of office printers and projectors, and the Centre for Economics and Business Research, an economic consulting firm. "Too many meetings" was the No. 1 time-waster at the office, cited by 47% of 3,164 workers in a separate study by career site Salary.com this year on workplace time drains. That is up from 42% in 2008, when meetings tied for third place with "waiting for a co-worker to finish something you need." (No. 1 was "fixing someone else's work" and No. 2 was "dealing with office politics.") Ad-agency executive Bill Shelton
acknowledges that he and others in his profession "have a way of drawing out meetings, grandstanding and trying to command attention. Part of your job is to sell your work, which you do in a meeting," he says. To keep meetings from dragging on, his boss at a former employer positioned the conference table in his office right under the air-conditioning vents. "About an hour before the meeting, he would crank down the thermostat to about 50 degrees," then tell employees as they arrived to "leave your sweater at the door," says Mr. Shelton, now president of Left Field Creative, a St. Louis ad agency "We had the most efficient, productive meetings in history, because everyone got down to business. We simply wanted to get out of the 'walk-in freezer.' " Get More Done Advice from executives, meeting planners and trainers on productive meetings: •Set a clear agenda. •Impose a 'no devices' rule or schedule periodic tech breaks for email, texts and phone calls. •Redirect people back to the agenda when they ramble or digress. •Draw out quiet people by asking them in advance for a specific contribution. •Do a 'round robin,' when appropriate, to allow everyone to contribute. •Ask early for objections to keep them from derailing discussions later. •Limit the length of slide presentations. •Interrupt people who talk too long or talk to each other. •Set an ending time for the meeting and stick to it.

Boeing Preps Redesign to Get 787 Flying Again
By
Jon Ostrower, Andy Pasztor and Daniel Michaels Updated Feb. 6, 2013 8:26 p.m. ET
Boeing Co. is proposing a series of battery design changes that it believes would minimize the risks of fire on its 787 Dreamliners and allow the grounded jets to fly again while it continues searching for a longer-term fix, say government and industry officials briefed on the matter. The company is looking at increasing the separation between cells in the lithium-ion batteries to reduce the potential hazards from heat or fire spreading within the batteries and adding enhanced heat-sensors, these officials said.

is a lot smaller now. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh,
who presided over the jury trial between the two rivals in a California courtroom last summer, on Friday overturned a jury's damage award for about half of the devices at issue in the case. The ruling slashes the amount Samsung is obligated to pay Apple by about $450.5 million, or nearly 43%, to $598.9 million. She ordered a new trial to consider the proper amount owed to Apple for the devices for which she reduced the damages. A Samsung spokesman said the South Korean company was pleased with the jduge's decisions to reduce the jury's award and deny a permanent injunction against its products. "Samsung intends to seek further review as to the remaining award," he said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Judge's Order See the full text of the court order on damages Enlarge Image
The judge's ruling slashes the amount Samsung is obligated to pay Apple by about $450.5 million, or nearly 43%, to $598.9 million.
Getty Images The ruling is a setback for Apple, which has locked horns with Samsung in courtrooms around the world for nearly two years—one of the most prominent in a series of patent battles in the smartphone industry. Last August, the jury found Samsung's devices infringed six Apple patents. Their damage award of slightly more than $1 billion was one of the largest patent awards on record. While reducing the potential financial blow to Samsung—at least temporarily—the ruling could also be a step on the road to settlement. Christal Sheppard,
a former chief patent and trademark counsel for Congress and now a law professor at the University of Nebraska, noted that both companies can now claim victory in this patent battle—Apple, for its initial win and Samsung for its reduction of damages. More Law Blog: Judge Koh Takes Bite out of Apple's Billion Apple Wins Big in Samsung Patent Trial Count by Count: The Apple-Samsung Verdict The Patent Trial of the Century "They've made their point and the devices are no longer relevant," she said, adding that Samsung has since changed its smartphones and tablets so they no longer infringe Apple's patents. "Both sides see some uncertainty in this process and there's little upside." She said it is unclear how the new trial would proceed, but noted that Judge Koh's decision appeared to mirror that of other judges who have complained that there aren't currently good ways to calculate damages in these massive patent battles. Judge Koh's order included discussion of Apple's argument that Samsung's infringing devices caused it to lose profits. As a result, a calculation by one of its experts about how much time Samsung's infringing products disrupted sales, and how much that hurt Apple, was an important part of the jury's final decision. An additional element was when Samsung had received notice that it was infringing Apple's patents, and how many products were sold afterward. In her 27-page order, the judge also discussed Apple's request for additional damages. She said the iPhone maker hadn't given enough evidence of lost profits to justify an increase in its award and neither company had cited enough case law to back up some of their claims. She also noted that due to the way one of Apple's witnesses argued how much the company should be awarded per device for each infringed patent, it was hard to reasonably calculate the right amounts based on various timelines about when Samsung was informed it had been infringing and how much money it had made since. The new trial will involve four Samsung phones—the Gem, Indulge, Infuse 4G and a Galaxy S II sold by AT&T Inc.

In her order, Judge Koh said the jury's award still stands for 14 of the devices targeted in the case, including Samsung's Galaxy Ace, Galaxy S II i9100, Galaxy Tab 10.1 WiFi and its 4G LTE variant, among others.

TIMBUKTU, Mali—French tanks were closing in on this storied caravan city on the night of Jan. 23, when the al Qaeda-backed militants who had governed Timbuktu since April left a departing blow. They broke into one of the world's most valuable libraries, ripping centuries-old manuscripts from shelves. Then they torched these priceless artifacts, in a scene of destruction that horrified scholars around the world. But in a relief for this beleaguered city, and in a triumph for bibliophiles, the vast bulk of the library was saved by wily librarians and a security guard—with an assist from modern technology. An estimated 28,000 of the library's artifacts were smuggled out of town by donkey cart, said Prof. Abdoulaye Cissé
and security guard Abba Alhadi,
who worked to relocate the documents. Gunmen managed to burn only a few hundred papers, but even those were backed up digitally, said the library's bookkeepers. "We knew that what we had here was threatened," said Mr. Cissé, a history professor and acting director for Timbuktu's Ahmed Baba Institute for Higher Studies and Islamic Research. "So I said, 'We're going to have to start moving them out.' " Enlarge Image

Aside from its 14th-century mud mosques, and a fabled name, Timbuktu houses at least 100,000 ancient manuscripts that date from the 11th century, and account for some of the medieval world's most sophisticated scholarship. Subjects include medicine, law, astronomy and botany. Still, the treasures of Timbuktu have been looted and smashed by a succession of invading armies, the most recent being al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM. In April, the al Qaeda affiliate, alongside local allies, took control of this dun-colored town—home to 50,000 people—and began imposing strict Islamic law. The punishments are spelled out on a lined piece of paper still left in the Malian Solidarity Bank that the rebels made their Islamic Police Headquarters. For petty theft, one hundred blows. For an affair with a married woman, death. The gunmen also bulldozed shrines deemed un-Islamic, some as old as the 15th century. The International Criminal Court has said the destructive binge could constitute a war crime, and is considering an investigation. On Sunday, al Qaeda's wrecking spree came to a close, as French and Malian tanks trundled into town. The parade brought locals dancing into the street, playing music (which had been banned) and smoking cigarettes (also banned) and waving French flags. Saving the Treasures of Timbuktu View Slideshow

Benoit Tessier/Reuters The next challenge is to hold the towns. French troops are looking to hand over the duty to a West African coalition of troops, who aren't as well armed as AQIM. France on Thursday conducted airstrikes on a mountain range in Mali's northeast where Islamist insurgents are believed to have sought refuge, as Diocunda Traoré,
Mali's interim president, signaled he was ready to begin conditional negotiations with ethnic Tuareg groups that have claimed the country's north as their independent homeland. Malian soldiers complain their enemies boast stronger, more ample ammunition. Many Malian officials say they believe rebels are refashioning Soviet rockets trafficked from Libya into dangerous land mines. There are other things buried under Timbuktu. Locals here have long stashed ancient documents under the brick floors of their houses, or under furniture, out of an enduring fear of invading armies. When Alpha Konaté's grandfather died six years ago, he found about 30 wooden trunks filled with manuscripts in a workroom where he had been forbidden to play as a child.

Others were plastered into the house's walls, stashed there by a great-grandfather who had accused French soldiers of stealing and destroying his parchments when they conquered this desert in 1905. The sepia-toned pages are penned in ornate Arabic. "We have more that belong to us, but they're in France," he said. More recently, technology offered a way to put Timbuktu's ancient manuscripts out of reach of pillagers. In 2008, the University of Cape Town helped finance a multistory, glass-paneled library and preservation complex, whose staff sought to digitize Timbuktu's written heritage. Locals were slow to bring in their papers, though. Just 2,000 texts were stored at the center, said Mr. Cissé, and other library workers. "They prefer to look after it themselves, because it's their cultural riches," he said. "They're all over the city." About 28,000 parchments stayed in Timbuktu's older, more modest library nearby. Both institutions came under threat in April, when the city fell to separatist rebels fighting to carve this northern half of Mali into an independent nation for the Tuareg people. The gunmen looted the town, and several tried to break down the doors of the new library. AQIM and an allied militia called Ansar Dine stopped the looting, said Mr. Cissé. Ansar Dine's leader, Iyad ag Ghaly
—famous in Mali for his reclusiveness—personally gave the curator his phone number. "He said, if these people ever come back to try again, you call us," said Mr. Cissé. Islamists sent a more-menacing message on Dec. 30, when they came to the old library, which houses the bulk of the literature. They told the guard, Mr. Alhadi, that they planned to convert the building into a Quranic school. Over the next two nights, Messrs. Cissé and Alhadi met in darkness, and began stuffing texts into empty burlap millet sacks. They stacked the bags onto donkey carts, stashed them in bedrooms, and over the next few days, carted them to small boats along the nearby Niger River. From there, the boats sailed four days south to the first town under government control, Mopti. A truck, the two men said, carried the priceless artifacts to the capital, Bamako, where officials with the University of Cape Town said they are safe. On Wednesday, Ansar Dine gunmen came to the library, said Mr. Alhadi. The elderly guard refused to let them in, then hobbled away on his cane. The militants broke in, taking a refrigerator, mattresses and plastic chairs—but no manuscripts. Across town, Mr. Konaté had a simpler preservation method. On Tuesday, he said he saw two gunmen looking at the plaque outside his house: It reads "Biblioteque de Manuscripts," or manuscript library, a reference to his grandfather's parchment collection. "I had no trust in them," said Mr. Konaté, a watch repairman by profession. So he emptied the shelves of his library, filled them with children's schoolwork, and stuffed his heritage into Nescafé boxes. —Gabriele Parussini in Paris contributed to this article.

VATICAN CITY—Two top managers at the Vatican bank resigned on Monday, the Holy See said, in a shake-up that deepens uncertainty around the scandal-plagued institution.

For more than a decade, telecom moguls and hedge fund titans have wrangled with regulators in a bid to wring billions of dollars out of thin air. This week, the government crowned a winner. The Federal Communications Commission late Tuesday said Dish Network Corp., led by satellite-TV pioneer Charlie Ergen, would be able to use a slice of the airwaves designated for satellite-phone transmissions to instead offer much more lucrative...

TOKYO—After months of much tension and little dialogue, Japan and China are edging gingerly toward repairing diplomatic relations, seeking ways to contain the fallout from a territorial row, even without any clear sign of how to resolve it. Tokyo's highest-ranking career diplomat traveled to Beijing on Monday for two days of talks to "exchange opinions on a broad range of issues" with Chinese officials, Japan's chief government spokesman said. It was the first time for the foreign ministry's top official to meet...
