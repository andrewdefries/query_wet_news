A false comparison, but that's to be expected from someone that doesn't use logic but uses emotion instead.But to answer your question, when they drafted the 2nd Amendment.BTW - Where you talking about the children the US military routinely murders in foreign lands or the most recent case of a mentally ill person on prescription meds going off the deep end?

Typical misdirection used by so many with an illogical Liberal mind. The real question is "when did the rights of the deranged and mentally ill" become more important than the life of a six year old child? Answer; Ask the bleeding heart liberals who champion them.

I'll tell you when. When Joe Biden spent all his time lecturing the NRA about the 2nd Ammendment and not a single word about actual school safety. Obviously he thinks it's more important. Seriously, quit while you are behind. Liberals don't belong in a discussion of logic.

Since when did emotions and Executive Orders by an un-American Dictator replace the US Constitution?Barack Obama and every representative who would be willing to infringe upon our Constitutional rights should be tossed out of office!My God, when are Americans going to get angry enough to stand up for their rights? I want to scream! This is our birthright! Better citizens than ourselves have fought, bled and died for our unalienable rights. You can't let it end like this. You can't surrender to a mere community organizer and his statist cohorts. Come on America--Stand-up and be counted. It's time to draw the line in the sand! Enough!

When did you acquire the right to argue that the 2nd amendment should simply be ignored because that appeals to you? That actually seems to be what you're suggesting.If you don't like the clear language contained in the second amendment, you're welcome to attempt to amend the US Constitution, but, until you do, it's language is quite clear and compelling. Is that so difficult to understand?

To all of you sheep out there...
Doesn't it bother you just a little bit that the same politicians who think they should make the decisions on what food you are allowed to eat are the same ones who want to take away your right to defend yourself? Why is all the gun crime highest in the city's with the strictest gun laws? Why do all the worst mass shooting occur in "Gun Free Zones"
Why is it the biggest failure in our gun control laws lies with the government bureaucracies that can't seem to upload their mental health database to the Federal background check system. And that same government is supposed to protect us when you take away everyone's guns?

Point one: No one is taking away your right to defend yourself. The issue is do you need an AK47 type weapon to do it.Point two: Gun crimes in cities - all the guns are flowing in from southern states that have loose or no gun laws at all.Point three: Gun Free Zones - because the offenders with guns bring the guns into said zones.Point four: Mental Health Databases - the great majority of mental health records are held by private institutions. There is no way in hell a private hospital is going to release mental health records to a government agency. State hospitals are a little different. But, since states have gotten rid of mental health facilities there aren't many records available.

Point one: I'll make that decision. Not you or Mike Bloomberg.
Point two: any data to back that up? Becuase you're facts are wrong.
Point three: Thanks for making my point. You advertise to the world that no one will be able to defend against afformentioned gunman. Point four: Wrong. Read the article about this very topic. Most states have a horrible record on submitting the data and who should be doing it. It's not because they don't have it. The state has a record of EVERY person involunarilly committed. Start with that. The Virginia Tech shooter would have been stopped by this very problem.

Point One: I DO need an AK47 and an AR15 to protect myself from a tyrannical government which is what the 2nd Amendment is about in the first place. And it is looking more and more like we will need a boat load of them under BHO."When governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government." - Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), US Founding Father, drafted the Declaration of Independence, 3rd US President of the United States

Joe,Point one: What exactly is "an AK47 type weapon?"Point two: How incredibly illogical it is to argue that, to provide for one's own defense, "...do you need an AK47 type weapon to do it" when you don't even bother to define what, as you use the term, "an AK47 type weapon" actually is.Point three: You are so unclear concerning your views on "gun free zones" that I have no idea what they are.Point four: What exactly is your point concerning "Mental Health Databases?"

A very interesting article from a foreign publication which doesn't fully support your comment that was meant to reflect the heading of the article. Howeveer it is possible to make a number of other inferences from it. Of the ten states mentioned California, Arizona, Indiana. Ohio and Pennsylvania are far from southern states. Texas may be considered southern but is far from the I-95 corridor.CA, TX and AZ are generally acknowledged to have the highest percentages of illegal Mexicans in their populations. Is there a connection?GA, FL TX, NC, CA, and VA have the greatest poulation of military personnel resident at facilitues in those states. Are illegal weapons coming from there?CA and TX are the two most populous states. You would expect them to be on the list for that reason.Washington DC, Chicago and Detroit are the large cities with very high crime and murder rates. . VA, IN and OH are the adjacent states to which the criminals are most likely to go for weapons due to proximity.Miami is another problem city and it is located in Florida. FL is also the fourth most populous state.The comment about Mexico is not pertinent to the subject of the articel. In addition, Mexico s further from I-95 than TX and is also where the Justice Dept. sent all the guns run in Fast and Furious. Those guns were all bought in AZ. Is that one of the reasons that AZ is on the list?I am not saying that my alternative hypotheses are correct, but the referred article does not have any more argument for saying its hypotheses are either correct.

Ironically, we seem to require less from someone who runs for President of the United States than we do for someone who wants to buy a gun. We've got to stop spending time on issues that are not as important as the overall financial health of the country otherwise we're going to be a country with thorough background checks on any form of purchase but with no citizen or government with enough money to buy anything. Let's focus on the big picture and not the issue of the moment that diverts attention from the real problems. We owe that to our great-great-great grandchildren.

I'm a big believer in gun control. Criminals should give up their guns, and gun crime should be prosecuted. If all those criminals gave up their guns and thuggish behavior, that would provide actual gun control, as people wouldn't feel the need to have guns for self-protection.Also, I'd like to see it made possible to commit mentally ill people with violent tendencies to mental institutions, as the Connecticut shooter's mom tried to do over and over to no avail. It should be a little easier.But how do we get the criminals to give up their guns? Option one: Follow current policy: Make crime easier, especially armed crime. Take away the guns of all who might be armed and resist their attacks, and just hope the "alleged" criminals are stupid enough to get caught and sent to prison, *after* the fact. Oops, the victims might already be dead...Option two: Increase the criminals' risk of getting shot by their prospective victims, by giving law-abiding citizens the right to freely bear arms and defend themselves, even if only to make the criminal move on to a less imposing victim. Nah, that can't be right....Chuck Schumer sez so....Discuss.

No one has to "GIVE" us anything because option # two already exists in the form of the second amendment to the United States Constitution. Schumer, Obama, Vice President (foot in the mouth) Biden and the anti-gun lobby want to change that to what you've described in option # one!

If that lop-eared, pin-headed , liar-in-chief, whjo is living in the WH thinks he can take my guns away from me, he is dead wrong, again. He is a master of double -speak , but even with the "village idioot", biden, at his side, he is a parody of what a real leader should be. We must stop this ego-maniac from creating any laws that will hasten thre demise of America as we knew it when we were the #1 power in the world.

I think that if one is an ex-criminal, mentally off, or incompetent (ie: if one could figure out what is incompetent), they should be denied gun ownership. A national data base would help.

Only a real right wing wako would believe someone should be allowed to purchase firearms without a background check. No wonder why the public are turning against the NRA loons in droves!

This is about our birthrights. If government can restrict our 2nd amendment by background checks, whats the point of the 2nd amendment? Back after the civil war, blacks had to pay the poll tax in order to vote, this is no different and affects us all.

blacks still have to pay a poll taxit's called VOTER SUPRESSIONMost Blacks and Hispanics vote democrat so making it nearly impossible for the Blacks and the Hispanics to vote it's on the very top of the republican agendaSo it's very interesting that The Republicans Want Blacks and Hispanics to show an ID to VoteBut the Republicans DO NOT want Blacks and Hispanics to show an ID to purchase an Assault Rifle

Only a left wing wako would think our birthrights are not important, while they are running around screaming that people with alternative lifestyles should have the right to marry....

The only thing you have to know JAMES in dealing with Pete Jones is the delicious irony that his avatar describes him perfectly!

Why is it that you have to call people names? Are you that low class that name calling is a normal part of your speech pattern?Face facts. A criminal can always get a weapon. Background checks don't impinge on a criminals ability to procure anything he has the money to pay for. He might just get something from the Attorney General. Drug laws haven't slowed down the drug trade and gun laws won't slow down illicit weapons trafficking. Background checks are just another ploy to reduce more of our rights.If the choice is between a criminal getting a weapon from a store versus the gov't compiling a database of every law abiding citizen with a gun, then I'll take my chances and still vote no checking. History teaches that gov't can't be trusted long term, and we are nearing the end of the road on this one. When Homeland Security contracts for 1.6 Billion rounds of hollow point ammo, something is afoot. Wake up!

I do not object to a background check, I object to the background check system - the shallowness of the check and the disposition of the information it has found. Government entities seldom perform as intended.The broad accusations of gun shows are also a problem. Not all gun shows are the same. When a member of the Washington Arms Collectors, membership required a background check and transactions between members therefore where covered. Non members at the show were required a background check.

When I was running a office I had several contract employees who did most of their work at home, spending only a few hours a month in the office itself. As long as they completed their work on time and satisfactorily it made no difference to me or my partners where the work was done. The other employees understood the arrangement and the type of work being done and didn't seem to care one way or another. It seemed to be a entirely satisfactory arrangement for all concerned but obviously won't work for all employees.

It’s a poor manager that can't articulate the goals of the company/department to their staff. They should manage to deliverables. It’s also a poor manager that doesn’t interact with their staff and know who they are, no matter where they are. For those who whine that they want to see the “whites of their eyes” so that they can “collaborate” don’t have what it takes to be an effective manager in today’s world. Who really cares where someone is located at as long as the work gets done and done right. They need to get a grip.

WASHINGTON—Vice President Joe Biden has resumed a push to withdraw virtually all U.S. troops from Afghanistan at year's end, arguing for a far-smaller presence than many military officers would like to see, said officials briefed on the discussions. The White House convened a meeting of top national-security officials on Thursday to discuss the war and the future of the U.S. troop presence. Mr. Biden has lost previous debates...

EU Targets Currency Derivatives
By
Matthew Dalton
May 5, 2010 1:03 p.m. ET
BRUSSELS—The European Commission wants to require most trading in currency derivatives to be routed through clearing houses, despite the relative resilience of this market during the financial crisis, according to a document from the European Union's executive branch. Clearing houses are at the heart of the EU's plans to reduce risk in the derivatives markets. They are entities that stand between buyers and sellers and absorb losses...

THINK DIFFERENT | Dorsey at the Legion of Honor museum in San Francisco's Lincoln Park
Photography by Elena Dorfman EVERY FEW MONTHS, Jack Dorsey
screens a carefully selected film for his employees at San Francisco–based Square, Inc.—a movie that "speaks to something we need to learn as a company," as he explains it. He's considering Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times as his next cinematic lesson. "Every little move Chaplin does, every tic," says Dorsey, "is either to further the story or for comedic effect. There's no wasted motion. It's so stark and so clear. And when you focus on the details and on efficiency of motion, something really magical happens." At 35, Dorsey has already masterminded not one but two of today's most fascinating, most disruptive technology brands. In 2006, he created Twitter, which has since evolved from a social-media hangout into a major platform for breaking news (as well as a key tool for politicians, nonprofit causes and the revolutionaries of the Arab Spring). In 2009, he founded Square, a mobile app that lets anyone accept credit card transactions using a smartphone or tablet. It has already improved the lives of millions of small-scale entrepreneurs—yoga instructors, piano teachers, food-truck chefs and others. It may, in time, upend the entire payments industry: Square has just announced it will handle all credit- and debit-card transactions for Starbucks's

7,000 American shops. The Innovator of the Year Awards 2012
Click to view this year's Innovator of the Year Award winners How does one person innovate in such grand fashion, then turn around and do it again? With both Twitter and Square, Dorsey's flashes of insight are by-products of a lifelong quest for simplicity and order. Dorsey yearns to create streamlined beauty out of giant ungainly systems that at first glance appear to be irredeemably chaotic. He is the Charlie Chaplin of technologists: He makes the impossible happen through efficiency of motion. Twitter emerged from Dorsey's teenage obsession with the unruly urban tangle of his hometown, St. Louis. He'd spend hours eavesdropping on the radio chatter from local ambulances. "They would announce where they were and where they were going," he recalls, "and I realized I could make a computer program that would plot their routes on to a street map." Before he'd even turned 18, Dorsey managed to transform this effort into software capable of simplifying the whole dispatch process. He set about searching the Internet for the largest dispatch company in the world. When he found it, he quickly hacked into its corporate servers, sent a note to its CEO's unlisted e-mail address (both announcing the security breach and asking for a job) and then moved to New York to become its lead programmer. This work eventually fed into the creation of Twitter, which lets not just vehicle fleets but regular people broadcast instant status updates—with no need for specialized equipment, and not just across a city grid but across the globe. Square was invented to cut through the complexities of a different network: the credit card payments industry. Dorsey has an artist friend, a glassblower, whose business was too small to justify the monthly fees and confusing rules and rates of a traditional credit card swipe machine. One day he failed to make a sale on a $2,000 piece because a customer had no cash on her. "That would've been enough money for him to live on for a month," says Dorsey. "The best innovations come out of real problems and real pain. As I was commiserating with him over our cell phones, it occurred to me that we were both holding up to our ears powerful general-purpose computers. I thought there must be some way we could use them to do easy money transfers." Soon enough, Dorsey had engineered a tiny swipe reader that could plug into the headphone jack of an iPhone or iPad. Square mails this free device to anyone who requests it. The company then nips a flat 2.75-percent fee from all transactions. For self-employed flight instructors and children's party magicians, Square is a godsend: zero upfront costs; intuitive to use; instant operability; and total mobility. The moment they grab that swipe reader from the mailbox and plug it into a smartphone, they can start accepting Visa, MasterCard,

just like a big box-chain store. Square also provides business analytics to help small merchants understand who's buying what, how much of it and how often. And the newer Pay With Square app lets a customer enter a store, make a purchase and pay for it without swiping anything: The customer simply states his name—the vendor's iPad automatically identifies any nearby smartphones running the app and then displays the customer's photo as confirmation before it processes linked credit card data. It's a retailer's dream—a completely frictionless transaction. (Which is precisely why a crop of Square competitors has begun to bloom. PayPal and Google

have already developed rival platforms. And companies like Visa and American Express are strongly motivated to prevent Square from acquiring enough clout to shove them around—and Have been backing the competition with this in mind.) DORSEY'S OVERARCHING MISSION flows from his urge to unencumber and simplify every corner of his life. For instance, he has no desk at Square. He works standing up at an immaculate, clutter-free table in the center of the wide-open office, typing alone on his iPad, easily accessible to colleagues who can informally sidle up and ask him questions. His daily uniform includes dainty Repetto shoes from France (because, as he recently tweeted, they are "light" and "graceful") and special open-collared shirts, the provenance of which he refuses to identify ("halfway between a Nehru and a priest's collar," as he describes them). This allows him to convey enough formality for meetings, yet frees him from the constriction of wearing ties. He encourages midday strolls outside Square's offices as a means of inspiration. He leads groups of employees on exploratory excursions to museums or across the Golden Gate Bridge. A man of widely varied interests, Dorsey is a genuine eccentric—not a mere collector of affectations. He treats his obsessions more as callings than as hobbies. When young, he studied botanical illustration under the tutelage of a master at the Missouri Botanical Garden, gazing for hours at the contours of gingko leaves. He later became fascinated by bespoke denim and enrolled in fashion design classes. Perhaps most bizarrely, he devoted himself for a solid year to the art of massage therapy, after dealing with sore wrists from too much coding. "I was ready to do massage for the rest of my life," he says. "I tried to convince a nightclub owner in St. Louis to let me give people chair massages at the edge of the dance floor, wearing all white clothes and white clogs. He thought it was a terrible idea, so I went back to programming." To protect his wrists, he trained himself to type in Dvorak—a keyboard alignment that is ergonomically superior to Qwerty. Dorsey delves deeply and intensely into whatever piques his curiosity, on the theory that innovation happens when disparate thoughts mesh. "It's important to demystify the term. Innovation is just reinvention and rethinking. I don't think there's anything truly, organically new in this world. It's just mash-ups of all these things that provide different perspectives—that allow you to think in a completely different way, which allows you to work in a different way." “
Jobs didn't worry much about how people might use his products to transform society. Dorsey identifies societal roadblocks and endeavors to unblock them.
”
Thus he carefully curates the cultural intake of his employees, in hopes that unfamiliar concepts might be distilled into something new. It's why he screens films: Modern Times for its economy of expression; Bullitt for its stark, empty compositions; Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory for its depiction of a company that packages delight and surprise. In a prominent spot near Square's welcome lobby stands a communal bookshelf where employees place reading material for their colleagues to peruse and borrow. Most titles lining the shelves cover subjects you might expect at a high-flying tech startup: inspirational CEO biographies, trend-gazing futurist tomes and guides to effective management technique. And then there are books placed on the shelf by Dorsey. He offers up Wabi-Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers—an explication of the Japanese concept of serendipitous beauty. He suggests Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea for its concision. (Papa Hemingway might have thrived under Twitter's 140-character constraint.) "My personal philosophy," says Biz Stone, a cofounder of Twitter, "is that creativity is being able to draw upon nonlinear paths to a solution. And the best way to do that is to have some knowledge of a lot of different fields." Other Silicon Valley entrepreneurs approach their ideas as scientists or mathematicians. But Dorsey is a curious polymath. "Jack is a technologist with the soul of an artist," says Stone. With Steve Jobs gone, Dorsey has become a new focal point for those who examine the tech world through the lens of biography. As one industry reporter puts it, Dorsey seems to have inherited Jobs's title as "the most fascinating man in tech." But the two men differ in vital ways. While Jobs was maniacally focused on Apple's products—he created new objects with perfect physical form and didn't worry all that much about how people might subsequently use them to transform society—Dorsey's vision is more top down, and of broader scope. He identifies big societal roadblocks and endeavors to unblock them. When asked which areas of interest he's eyeing for a potential third act—after communication and payments—Dorsey mentions health. "It's the most precious thing we have as humans and yet the average person knows so little about it. I don't know how health insurance works. I don't know how the health industry works. I don't know how to diagnose myself. We need new tools." Perhaps Dorsey, in his head, is already reinventing, beautifying and simplifying another of life's many thorny thickets. The Innovative Workplace From the notebook of Twitter creator and Square founder Jack Dorsey, field notes for a more perfect corporate union.

plans to raise around $1 billion this week to strengthen its balance sheet, according to two people involved in the deal. The Mumbai-based bank hopes to raise around $877 million by selling 34 million shares to institutional investors around 1,390 rupees ($25.84) a share, one of the people said. It plans to raise another $152 million from some existing shareholders by selling them shares on a preferential basis at the same price, another person said. The expected price would translate into a small discount to the bank's share price on Monday, which was 1,415.1 rupees ($26.21) apiece on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Bankers already have begun taking orders. If successful, this would be the largest equity share sale this year. The deal is being managed by Citigroup Inc.,

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and Axis Capital Ltd., a unit of Axis Bank, the two people said, asking not to be identified ahead of a formal announcement. Large banks like Axis need to raise funds to meet regulatory norms that govern the ratio of a bank's capital to outstanding loans. At the end of December, Axis Bank's capital adequacy ratio—the ratio of its capital to risk-weighted assets like loans—stood at 13.73%. This was higher than the regulatory minimum of 9%, but India's third-largest nongovernment bank by assets needs to further boost its capital as it expands its business and makes fresh loans.In December, the bank's board allowed the lender to issue up to 45.8 million shares to raise up to $1 billion. The bank informed Indian stock exchanges of its plan to sell shares earlier Monday, but didn't elaborate how much money it hoped to raise or whether it plans to issue all of the shares allowed by the board To sell its shares, Axis is looking to capitalize on a recent resurgence in investor appetite for Indian equity. The benchmark 30-share Sensex gained nearly 26% in 2012, and has risen another 3.5% since the start of this year, to close at 20103.35 on Monday.

Healthy eating doesn't have to be an exercise in self-denial—really. Inventive chefs are devising ways to make rich-tasting food without the fat, salt and sugar. Liz Gunnison reports. Photo: F. Martin Ramin for The Wall Street Journal.
GOD WILLING, 2013 will go down in history as the year chefs emerged from the haze of fat-forward cooking, rubbed the lard from their eyes and discovered all the flavor they were missing. Lighten Up Without Dumbing It Down
Enlarge Image
LIGHT, FANTASTIC | Cathal Armstrong of Restaurant Eve in Alexandria, Va., created this 'fettuccine carbonara' without relying on the animal fats that make the classic version so heavy.
Linda Pugliese for The Wall Street Journal, Food Styling by Jamie Kimm, Prop Styling by Stephanie Hanes 'EGGS AND CHEESE'In place of the traditional, cholesterol-laden sauce, the pasta is cloaked in a velvety white-bean purée. 'BACON' Crisp crescents of toasted garlic lend the texture and savory depth typically provided by guanciale, a fatty, unsmoked Italian bacon.
Anyone who has logged time tableside at America's trendier restaurants can attest to the full-throttle bender on which chefs have escorted diners in recent years. The cooking aesthetic I'm talking about is summed up quite evocatively in a term coined a couple of years ago by the food writer Josh Ozersky: lardcore. Deep-fried pig tails. Bacon deviled eggs. Marrow bones the size of hockey sticks. Foie gras doughnuts. The list goes on. Then there are the rivers of butter and cream that course through these meals unseen, basting meats and fish, thickening sauces or simply as an insurance policy whenever a dish's oomph is in doubt. Cathal Armstrong,
chef-owner of Restaurant Eve in Alexandria, Va., has been among the first to cry "uncle." After joining first lady Michelle Obama's "Let's Move!" campaign against childhood obesity and subsequently shedding 50 pounds of his own, Mr. Armstrong set his sights on his restaurant guests: Shouldn't they benefit from the same nutritional standards he sets for himself and his kids? So Mr. Armstrong began tinkering with preparations and proportions, experimenting with trading the calorie-dense and nutrition-light for more nourishing fare. In the process, he discovered that the flavors he could achieve without all the fat and salt weren't just passable; they were actually better. Enlarge Image
Cathal Armstrong of Restaurant Eve in Alexandria, Va.
Melissa Golden for the Wall Street Journal Take carrot purée, which would traditionally be made by simmering the vegetable in liquid, then puréeing and layering in butter, cream and salt. Now, Mr. Armstrong uses the sous-vide method—sealing the food in plastic and submerging it in a low-temperature water bath—to cook carrots slowly in their own juices, concentrating their flavor to create a pungent carrot mousse that runs rings around the classical version. "Using lots of butter is the way we all learned. We always said 'fat equals flavor,' " Mr. Armstrong explained. "Well, it does, but there are other things that have flavor, too." With that in mind, Mr. Armstrong has quietly transformed Restaurant Eve into a prototype for healthy high-end dining. Sauces thickened with butter and flour in the old French style have been replaced by lively vinaigrettes and clean, protein-rich meat stocks. House-made Greek yogurt is used instead of cream. Game meats like venison and antelope, with their earthy complexity and low fat content, have become go-to ingredients. Rib eye is still on the menu, but it's grass-fed (and therefore leaner), the portion is smaller and it's served alongside an appropriate complement of vegetables. The restaurant doesn't charge guests for water (still or sparkling), which Mr. Armstrong believes is vital to a balanced diet. "This is not 'spa food' by any stretch of the imagination," Mr. Armstrong said. "It's rich and fulfilling and everything luxury food should taste like. You eat a nine-course tasting menu and you're stuffed at the end of it. Tomorrow morning, you'll be hungry for breakfast, because it's all-natural and your body can absorb it easily." “
'This is not spa food,' Mr. Armstrong said. 'It's rich and fulfilling and everything luxury food should taste like.'
”
In many ways, this evolved approach seems overdue. Today's chefs are some of the best-trained and most curious cooks the country has ever known, and stories about them taking their own eating habits in hand to drop excess pounds are increasingly commonplace. Many have become involved in childhood nutrition, too. Meanwhile, fresh, high-quality ingredients are more available than ever, meaning there's rarely a need to compensate for substandard raw materials. And while Falstaffian excess seems to be the order of the day, the idea of mining for flavor outside the easy reaches of salt, fat and sugar isn't actually a novel approach to fine cooking. France's nouvelle cuisine of the 1960s and '70s was all about ditching heavy sauces in favor of a lighter touch; by the mid-1980s, French expat Hubert Keller
was showing Americans that his native cuisine could be at once light, vegetable-focused and luxurious at his San Francisco restaurant Fleur de Lys. Mr. Keller has since made a career of teasing out flavor via health-conscious methods—whether as simple as slow-roasting a root vegetable in its own juices, or as innovative as enriching a meat sauce with thrice-blanched, puréed garlic in place of butter. Flavor Cheat Sheet Chef Cathal Armstrong's techniques for making dishes tasty without making them unhealthy Drop some acid. Adding a splash of citrus juice or vinegar to sauces, soups and stews can awaken your palate even more effectively than salt. Try Sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar for meat-based preparations, lime juice with lobster dishes and lemon juice everywhere else. Make friends with cured meats and smoked fish. Rich, funky smoked trout, gravlax, prosciutto, pancetta and the like pack a lot of savory punch in small portions. Trade a meaty Bolognese for tomato sauce with a little bacon or pancetta added for body and flavor. A cracker topped with smoked trout and crème fraîche makes for a memorable, elegant hors d'oeuvre. Grow your herbs and grind your spices. Herbs begin to lose their zest the moment they're picked, so it's well worth growing your own parsley, cilantro, basil and chives to sprinkle on dishes just before serving. Try mixing fresh-picked herbs in with leafy greens, too, for a vibrant salad. In the same vein, buying spices like pepper, cinnamon, coriander, nutmeg and cumin whole and grinding them just before use is the only way to experience their full effect. In desserts, using freshly ground spices can allow you to cut the sugar content by up to one-third. Sear like you meant it. Getting a dark, strong sear, or even char, on everything from steak to mushrooms provides an extreme flavor boost. Outdoor grills are a great place to play with the power of high heat without triggering smoke alarms. When cooking indoors, always start with a hot pan, then add a heat-safe oil like canola and wait until it's so hot it shimmers. Once you place your food on the heat, leave it undisturbed for at least one or two minutes to ensure that it browns properly.
"When you're trained to cook with lots of fat, it becomes automatic," Mr. Keller said. "But I would tell young chefs, 'Push against the wall and you'll see doors open up.' That's all that cooking is: extracting flavors and making things taste good. Sometimes we forget that we don't need to add flavor to a beautiful vegetable. We just need to find it." Mr. Armstrong and others are doing just that. Tory McPhail, who won a James Beard Award last month for his work at Commander's Palace, has made his mark on the New Orleans institution by delivering flavor without all the fat. "Twenty years ago it was heavy lemon butter and cream sauces," said Mr. McPhail. "These days we do more vinaigrettes and infused olive oils." Meanwhile, fish and meat portion sizes have been reduced across the board. At brunch, the famous white-truffle hollandaise is made with twice as much lemon juice and served in half the quantity it used to be. Mr. McPhail rhapsodizes about a new brown-butter vinaigrette that, via a little culinary wizardry, gets its unctuous texture from egg whites and uses only a little bit of butter for flavor. "I feel myself getting more conscious of how food makes you feel over the course of the day, or the course of the week," Mr. McPhail said. "I think chefs have a responsibility to guests to not only feed them, but to be helpful to their diet." Nate Appleman,
another James Beard award-winning chef, lost 75 pounds after the birth of his son. His health-focused ethos was already firmly in place when he switched two-and-a-half years ago from a career in fine dining to his current role as the culinary manager for Chipotle Mexican Grill.

One of his most recent success stories is a new menu item (currently available only in California) called sofritas, a meat-free and nearly fat-free dish that derives its flavor from the patient, low-heat cooking of onions, garlic, peppers and tomatoes into a deep, savory stew of sorts. He seasons the dish with freshly ground, dried chipotle peppers—the traditional method of soaking the chilies in water before grinding leaches away some of their flavor, he said. And he adds tofu for protein. Mr. Appleman has also been busy developing the company's new Asian concept, called ShopHouse. There, he relies on blisteringly hot woks and planchas to give foods smoky, seared flavor, and plenty of citrus and vinegar in place of excess salt. "We don't even have a fryer," said Mr. Appleman. "Which is sort of crazy for a quick service restaurant." Barbara Lynch,
the chef-owner behind critically acclaimed Boston restaurants including No. 9 Park and Menton, describes herself as a "health freak." She says the food at her restaurants, which range in focus from Italian to French, has gradually evolved to hew more closely to her own nutritional practices. These days she uses very little butter. Flour is confined to pasta and bread, and left out of sauces and off meats. Portions are smaller, and desserts aren't overly sweet. She's also working on a retail line of dehydrated vegetables designed as a better alternative to frozen options for time-crunched home cooks. When it comes to proteins, Ms. Lynch is excited about fish and game birds. "There are other things out there besides pork fat," she said. "I'm so sick of pig." And yet lovers of pork belly confit and duck-fat french fries needn't despair; rest assured, these trappings of culinary indulgence are hardly in danger of extinction. Even the most health-centric chefs are quick to acknowledge that it's expanding and developing flavor, not simply abandoning high-fat foods, that's really at the heart of what they're doing. "We haven't stricken fat from the record," Mr. Armstrong readily admitted. "You need some fat. It all comes back to balance. Fine dining was all about fat. It doesn't have to be." 'Fettuccine Carbonara' This vegan riff on a carbonara (pictured above) derives its deceptively meaty flavor from garlic that is roasted until it is mellow, complex and deeply savory. Puréed with white beans and vegetable stock, it makes for a rich tasting, but not heavy, sauce. Active Time: 30 minutes Total Time: 1¼ hours Serves: 4 1 small head of garlic, plus 4 cloves, thinly sliced and lightly toasted 1 tablespoon olive oil 6 ounces canned, cooked white beans or 1/3 cup dried beans, cooked ¾ cup vegetable stock 8 ounces fettuccine 2/3 cup frozen peas, thawed or fresh peas, blanched Salt and freshly ground black pepper What To Do 1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cut ½ inch off top of garlic bulb. Drizzle with oil and wrap in foil. Roast until tender, 45-60 minutes. 2. Squeeze roasted garlic cloves into a blender or food processor and discard skin. Add beans and purée. With the motor running, add stock in a steady stream, using only enough to yield a creamy, sauce-like consistency. Strain sauce through a fine-mesh sieve and set aside. 3. Meanwhile, cook pasta according to instructions on package. 4. In a medium-size pan, heat bean purée until warm. Add pasta and peas and stir to combine. Season with salt to taste. Divide among four serving bowls. Garnish with toasted garlic slices and season with pepper to taste. Shiitake Mushrooms With Harissa Vinaigrette Harissa, the Tunisian chili paste packed with spices and herbs, can add punch to all kinds of dishes. To save time, you can use a store-bought harissa and skip straight to the instructions for making the vinaigrette. Total Time: 1 hour Serves: 4 Enlarge Image
Shiitake Mushrooms With Harissa Vinaigrette
Linda Pugliese for The Wall Street Journal, Food Styling by Jamie Kimm, Prop Styling by Stephanie Hanes For the harissa: 1 pint Fresno chilies 1 teaspoon coriander seeds 1 teaspoon caraway seeds 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 4 cloves garlic ½ teaspoon smoked paprika 1 tablespoon olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped mint 1 teaspoon lemon juice For the vinaigrette: 1 tablespoon harissa ¼ cup lemon juice ¼ cup lime juice ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil ½ cup canola oil For the mushrooms: 4 tablespoons canola oil 1½ pounds shiitake mushrooms, trimmed 1½ teaspoons chopped garlic 1½ teaspoons chopped fresh thyme Salt and freshly ground black pepper ¼ cup cilantro leaves, roughly chopped What To Do 1. Make harissa: Place chilies under broiler and roast, turning frequently, until blistered and lightly charred all over, 6-8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover and let steam 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a skillet set over medium heat, toast coriander, caraway and cumin seeds until fragrant, 2 minutes. Grind toasted spices in a spice or coffee grinder. Once chilies have steamed, rub off skins. Place peeled chilies in a food processor along with ground spices, garlic, paprika, olive oil, mint and lemon juice, and blend to a paste. Remove harissa from food processor and set aside. 2. Make vinaigrette: In food processor, combine 1 tablespoon harissa, lemon and lime juices and blend to combine. With motor running, add olive and canola oils in a light stream, blending until emulsified. 3. Sauté mushrooms: In a heavy-bottomed skillet, heat canola oil over high heat until shimmering. Add shiitakes and sauté until browned and tender, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and thyme, stir to coat mushrooms and cook 2 minutes more. Transfer mixture to a bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. 4. Toss mushrooms with ¼ cup vinaigrette. Reserve remaining vinaigrette and harissa in airtight containers in the refrigerator for later use. Transfer dressed mushrooms to a serving bowl and garnish with cilantro. Salmon With Ham Hock Vinaigrette The braising liquid from a slow-cooked ham hock brings smoky depth—but little fat—to the vinaigrette on this pan-fried salmon. Active Time: 1 hour Total Time: 5 hours Serves: 4 Enlarge Image
Salmon With Ham Hock Vinaigrette
Linda Pugliese for The Wall Street Journal, Food Styling by Jamie Kimm, Prop Styling by Stephanie Hanes 1 smoked ham hock 1 carrot, coarsely chopped ½ onion, coarsely chopped 1 celery stalk, coarsely chopped 10 sprigs thyme 5 sprigs rosemary 1 fresh bay leaf 3 cups veal or beef stock 2 small shallots, minced ¼ cup red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon chopped chives 3 tablespoons olive oil Four 5-ounce salmon fillets Salt 2 tablespoons canola oil What To Do 1. Preheat oven to 275 degrees. In a small, lidded, oven-safe casserole, cook ham hock, carrots, onions, celery, thyme, rosemary, bay leaf and stock, covered, until ham is very tender, about 4 hours. 2. Remove casserole from oven and let ham cool completely in liquid. Once ham is cool, place it on a cutting board and remove meat from bone, discarding fat and skin. Finely dice meat and set aside. 3. Strain liquid through a fine-mesh sieve into a heavy-bottomed pan. Place pan over medium heat and cook, skimming often to remove any fat rising to the surface, until liquid is reduced by about half and reaches a syrupy consistency, 15-20 minutes. 4. In a mixing bowl, whisk shallots, diced ham, vinegar, ¼ cup reduced ham-hock liquid, chives and olive oil until combined. 5. Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until very hot, about 3 minutes. Season salmon with salt. Swirl canola oil into skillet, then add salmon. For rare fillets, sear 1-2 minutes per side. Divide fillets among four plates and spoon vinaigrette over salmon. Serve immediately. Explore More

Biography

What's trending on Twitter? The use of an option known as 'favoriting,' which is becoming a go-to tool for some people who long for a more discreet, less public way to navigate the raucous waters of the popular social network. Choire Sicha, a writer and editor, says he favorites tweets he likes and even tweets he hates.

The Twitter feature allows users to mark with a star icon tweets they find amusing or useful. Doing so both bookmarks the tweet and alerts its creator that they appreciate the sentiment without republishing it in their own streams. This May, Twitter users hit the favorite button on tweets 1.6 billion times—four times more than they did in May 2012, according to Topsy, a data-analytics company that is a partner to Twitter, Inc., which now has 200 million monthly active users. The rise in 'favoriting'—or starring, as it's also known—is a safer way to engage with others on the network. Rather than retweeting risky comments or observations, users can more quietly add their approval or note their amusement by favoriting. Choire Sicha, a writer and co-founder of the blog The Awl, says a "lack of impulse control" got him in trouble a few times on Twitter. Now he relies heavily on favoriting as a means to let him more carefully communicate with his Twitter network of friends and strangers. In a recent 24-hour period, he tweeted, retweeted or replied to other users' tweets 47 times. During the same period, he favorited tweets 150 times. He favorites tweets when they make him laugh. "I also use it to back one side in a fight, when two people are going at it and I don't want to get involved," he says. When a tweet annoys him, he does what he calls "hate-favoriting," a sort of sarcastic use of the favorite option. "When someone is totally awful, hitting 'favorite' is the most perverse thing you can do." Josh Hara, a creative director at an advertising agency in Columbus, Ohio, learned how to tell jokes on Twitter by immersing himself in the community at the website Favstar.
Resource John Manoogian III,
the founder of 140 Proof, a social-advertising company in San Francisco, has been using Twitter since 2006, the year it launched. He considers favoriting the most valuable Twitter currency. Mr. Manoogian
says that a tweet with many favorites often suggests that it has caused people to laugh spontaneously—and to quickly hit the star icon as a wink, a hat-tip, a show of appreciation. "Favorites are like a secret discovery mechanism to find who is the funniest," he says. On Twitter's website or its smartphone apps, user profiles include a favorites tab that reveals a list of the user's favorite tweets. But it takes several clicks to land on that list, and in the twitterverse, that is a lot of effort. Enter Favstar, a website dedicated to ranking tweets and tweeters by the favorites they generate. Founded in 2009 by Tim Haines,
Favstar has 3 million monthly users. Mr. Haines, an engineer, says he created the site because he realized that the favorite was an important feedback signal that could help him get a sense of what his Twitter followers were interested in reading in his feed. Enlarge Image
Comedian Jim Gaffigan's Favstar page
favstar Favstar has morphed into a tool that helps people find writers and comedians, as well as a community for writers and comedians to meet online. It now offers pro accounts. For $29.99 for six months, premium subscribers can nominate tweets for the Tweet of the Day award and connect with other pro users. Josh Hara,
an associate creative director for social content at a marketing firm in Columbus, Ohio, joined Twitter in 2009. He built a following of nearly 59,000 by surfing Favstar and learning how to craft a joke in 140 characters or less. He still judges his own humor based on favorites. "If I don't get more than 10 faves in first three minutes after tweeting something, I'll probably delete it," he says. Heather Denkmire, 43, became active on Favstar a few years ago. She says she met talented writers through the site, but became obsessed with monitoring how many favorites her tweets were generating. Ms. Denkmire,
who lives in Portland, Maine, says she pays no attention to how many people are starring her tweets. "It can have a high-school popularity-contest vibe," she says. Write to Katherine Rosman at katherine.rosman@wsj.com Email

Next BOE Head Plays Down Talk of Major Change
By
Charles Forelle And Jason Douglas Updated Feb. 7, 2013 4:29 p.m. ET
LONDON—Mark Carney, the Bank of England's next governor, told a parliamentary committee Thursday that the U.K. should debate its methods of setting monetary policy, though he sounded skeptical notes about any radical change to the inflation-watching regime that has long been the tool of choice in major economies. Mr. Carney, now the governor of the Bank of Canada, said repeatedly that he thought charging the central bank with holding...

Motor Co., long considered the sickest of the Big Three U.S. auto makers, is showing signs of a surprise turnaround. When Chief Executive Alan Mulally took over in 2006, Ford was barreling toward the worst one-year loss -- $12.6 billion -- in its 105-year history. A frail U.S. economy and high gasoline prices were ripping into sales. But in the past year, Mr. Mulally, a former Boeing Co. executive with no auto experience, has improved year-on-year earnings each quarter. In 2007, Ford startled the industry by reporting $400 million in positive operating cash flow, something General Motors Corp.

That chopped $1 billion off Ford's warranty costs last year. The firm isn't done cost-cutting. According to people close to Mr. Mulally, he is looking at selling Volvo despite Ford's repeated statements that it intends to hang on to the brand. Similarly, he hopes to shutter the ailing Mercury brand. More job cuts may be coming. In Ford's most recent buyout offer, only about 4,000 workers signed on, according to a person familiar with the matter, about half the desired total. Mr. Mulally will likely offer one more round, then could resort to layoffs, people familiar with the matter say. "Clearly, we have lots of mechanisms to keep taking the fixed costs out," Mr. Mulally says. He declined to comment on the possibility of a Volvo sale, and has long maintained that Ford is committed to Mercury. Discuss

On Thursday, Ford's quarterly earnings will offer fresh clues as to whether Mr. Mulally can actually deliver on his promise to be profitable by 2009, a goal many thought improbable a year ago. Analysts expect Ford to post losses of 15 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial, the same as a year earlier. Ford executives have repeatedly said their goal is to continue year-on-year gains. Like GM and Chrysler, Ford has trimmed costs in ways big and small. It has eliminated more than 46,000 North American jobs in the past few years, or about a third of its work force. It has also reined in a mind-boggling level of vehicle customization, which jacked up costs. Until recently, for instance, the Lincoln Navigator offered 128 options on its console alone. "You know what 128-factorial is -- it's a lot of combinations," Mr. Mulally joked at a conference recently, mocking the number of designs theoretically resulting from mixing-and-matching the options. (Answer: 3.85620482 x 10 to the 215th power.) But unlike Chrysler and GM, Ford has also rapidly pared back the number of brands it offers so it can instead focus on the core Ford lineup. Mr. Mulally shed Aston Martin, Jaguar and Land Rover -- acquired over the past two decades -- to steer investment toward Ford and accelerate a push into new small cars, where sales are rising. Shedding Volvo and Mercury would leave Ford with only two lines, Ford and Lincoln, plus a controlling stake in Mazda Motor Corp. By contrast, GM is sticking with eight brands. Chrysler, a much smaller company, is still sorting out how to position its three. 'Shrink to Grow' "This is a classic example of how one can shrink to grow," says Peter Nesvold, an analyst at Bear Stearns. Mr. Mulally "is making many difficult decisions during a down cycle, which should benefit the company as they enter the next upturn." Ford's restructuring could still lose traction. Rising energy prices, Wall Street's debt-market woes and the nation's housing downturn are also hurting auto sales. Annual sales this year could hit their lowest level in more than a decade, according to J.D. Power & Associates. And while Ford is doing well now with the Edge small SUV, Fusion sedan and Focus compact, car-buyers can be fickle. A few years ago, Chrysler had huge hits with the 300 sedan loaded with a powerful eight-cylinder engine, but its appeal has waned as gasoline prices zoomed past $3 a gallon. Moreover, Ford still needs cooperation from the United Auto Workers union to replace older workers with lower-paid new hires. Still, Mr. Mulally, 62 years old, has managed to improve the bottom line during the worst auto-sales downturn in more than a decade, while shifting Ford's vehicle mix away from fuel-thirsty trucks and SUVs. In 2004, Ford relied on large trucks and SUVs for 70% of sales; in March that number was 43%. Mr. Mulally came to Ford from Boeing, the aircraft maker, where he had spent his entire career. Boeing twice passed him up for the CEO's job despite his work rehabilitating Boeing's once-struggling commercial-airplane division by borrowing efficiency ideas from Toyota. Newshound Quiz

By the summer of 2006, Ford's troubles were mounting. William C. Ford Jr., then CEO as well as chairman, decided the auto maker needed a new chief executive. A Ford board member suggested Mr. Mulally. On a Saturday in July, Mr. Mulally flew out for a meeting at Mr. Ford's home in Ann Arbor, Mich. The two quickly hit it off: Both men recall that, during the meeting, they started finishing each other's sentences. They also agreed that, to restore profitability, the company should focus on its core Ford business. But Mr. Mulally quickly ran up against a corporate culture that viewed Ford as just one brand among many. In one case, he recalls, colleagues suggested he remove the blue Ford logo from the pages of a PowerPoint presentation lest colleagues from Volvo, Jaguar, Lincoln or other brands feel slighted. "You're going to alienate everybody," Mr. Mulally recalls being told. He capitulated. A big cause of Ford's trouble was becoming clear to the new CEO. Ford, like GM and Chrysler, profited richly on trucks and SUVs during the 1990s but ceded to the Japanese in cars. Ford only had one small car, the Focus, compared with Toyota's six. Dumbfounded Mr. Mulally was also dumbfounded to discover Ford's various global regions operated independently of one another. After one product-development review, he learned Ford built two Focus small cars, with different parts, depending on the market -- one sporty, hot seller in Europe and a cheaper dud in the U.S. "Can you imagine having one 737 for Europe and one 737 for the United States?" Mr. Mulally said. There is a business rationale for designing individual vehicles for different markets. For years, Ford adhered to the strategy as a way to cater to regional consumer tastes. Mr. Mulally accelerated Ford's restructuring plan, among other things curtailing low-profit-margin bulk sales to rental-car fleets. The move was risky and caused Ford's market share to drop below 15%. For the first time ever, Toyota passed Ford as the second-largest car maker, behind only GM, in the U.S. by sales. But Mr. Mulally wanted Ford's market share to reach its "natural level" -- the volume where cars sell without big discounts. "I don't care what market-share level you are," Mr. Mulally says, the goal is to "get back to profitability." Last year's 6% production cut helped Ford command higher prices for its cars, narrowing its annual pretax loss by $4 billion. Car Makers' Holy Grail To attack Ford's far-flung operations, he turned to Derrick Kuzak, the North American development chief who had also worked in Europe, where Ford builds several highly regarded cars. The mission: Build a portfolio of "world cars" that share most of their components no matter where they're sold. This is the holy grail for car makers because it improves economies of scale. But it's tricky because it requires global teamwork to build vehicles that appeal across cultures. Ford's first big test will be the Fiesta subcompact, its first world car under Mr. Mulally, which goes on sale in Europe and Asia this year, then hits U.S. showrooms in 2010. How well Americans receive it will go a long way toward determining whether Ford can compete with foreign rivals. To improve its competitiveness in small cars, in early 2007 one of Mr. Kuzak's lieutenants assembled a team of engineers, marketers, and other experts to update the Focus compact sold in the U.S. Over the years, Ford executives internally had come to deride such cars as "cheap and cheerful," due to their staid designs. Mr. Kuzak's objective was a tall order -- remake the Focus to be appealing to "millennials," or first-time buyers under the age of 28. To get inside the heads of young consumers, team members immersed themselves in twentysomething pop culture. In a conference room they posted pictures of the brands and personalities that had managed to appeal to the generation, including actress Jessica Alba and the Starbucks coffee brand. One team member began watching the Disney channel's "Hannah Montana" show, a hit among young people. To tap into younger consumers' love of cellphones and portable music players, the team decided to center the marketing of the Focus on a new voice-controlled entertainment system called Sync. Developed by Microsoft Corp., it lets drivers use voice commands to control a car stereo, among other things. As the Focus launch approached, however, sales and market share continued to slide. In April, members of the Ford family (which controls the auto maker) gathered to hear from a Wall Street deal-making firm amid concerns over Ford's suspended dividend and general financial weakness. Meetings like these are often convened to weigh a company's sale. Ultimately, the family decided not to hire the firm lest they undermine Mr. Mulally, whom they wanted to first give a chance, said a person familiar with the situation. Shortly after that, more tangible signs of turnaround became apparent. The new Edge small SUV was a hit. With production and inventory reigned in, Ford was under less pressure to offer discounts, protecting profit margins. In the second quarter, Ford surprised investors by posting a $750 million profit. Meanwhile, Mr. Mulally was thinking about distractions -- namely, Ford's other brands including Jaguar and Land Rover. A courteous Midwesterner who often describes things as "neat," Mr. Mulally can resort to profanity when discussing Ford's past acquisitions of noncore brands like these, people familiar with the matter say. Mr. Mulally says he isn't judgmental about Ford's past decisions. Ford had already sold Aston Martin, the niche British sports-car maker. In early summer 2007, Mr. Mulally told Mr. Ford they should also part with Jaguar and Land Rover. Mr. Ford wasn't so sure that was a good idea. Land Rover had some hot-selling new models, and Jaguar seemed to be poised for a comeback. But Mr. Mulally argued the company "can't support all this and have Ford recover as fast as you'd like," according to people familiar with the matter. Earlier this year, Ford sold the brands to India's Tata Motors Ltd. for $2.3 billion, less than half what it originally paid. Mr. Ford says he remained "in total sync" with Mr. Mulally "from day one" about selling the luxury brands. Any differences, he says, arose over minutiae in completing a sale. Last fall, the company made two other big strides. To create a new image for Ford, Mr. Mulally poached Jim Farley, a Toyota marketing guru. In November, the company reached a landmark cost-cutting deal with the United Auto Workers union. By then the launch of the Focus was under way, and the voice-controlled Sync was such a hit that Ford started offering it as a standard feature on other models. So far this year, vehicle sales in the U.S. are down 8%, but Focus sales are up 23%. This past January -- about 18 months after his first, logo-free, PowerPoint presentation -- Mr. Mulally started making managers carry around pocket-sized plastic cards outlining his "One Ford" vision in bullet points. At the top of the card: Ford's blue oval. Write to Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com
