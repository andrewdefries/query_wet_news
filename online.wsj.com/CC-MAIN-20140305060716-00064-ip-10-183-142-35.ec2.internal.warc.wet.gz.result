Republic Wireless has a service for those who want to pay only $19 a month for unlimited data, voice, and text, but they have to use the Motorola Defy XT Smart Phone, which Walt Mossberg says is mediocre. (Photo: Republic Wireless)
A typical smartphone costs around $200, but it's usually shackled to a two-year contract that often costs $70 or more monthly and includes limits on data consumption, voice minutes and texts. Even prepaid smartphones, without a contract, can cost $30 to $50 a month and carry limits. But I've been testing an Android smartphone from an upstart carrier that charges just $19 a month for unlimited data, voice and texts—with no contract. That's right: $19 a month, unlimited. Motorola's Defy XT is the only phone that works with Republic's network.
Republic Wireless Mossberg's Mailbox A New View on Windows This carrier is called Republic Wireless, a private firm in Raleigh, N.C., which launched its service in December. The sole phone that works with the company's technology is a Motorola model, the Defy XT. The phone costs $249—partly to help offset the low monthly price. However, as of Tuesday, the company is offering a second pricing option for people who would rather pay less up front: $99 for the phone and then $29 a month, unlimited. That's still a bargain service price. The phone and two service plans are only available online, at republicwireless.com. The company offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. And to sweeten the deal, Republic says Motorola will be offering customers a $50 credit at the Google

So what's the catch? Well, Republic is using an unusual technology approach that's smart and may even represent the future. But today, it doesn't deliver the best voice quality and it requires a specially equipped phone. The sole phone that works with the system now is mediocre. Republic is mostly able to offer such low monthly prices because it's a Wi-Fi-centric carrier. That means whenever you make a voice call while the phone is connected to a Wi-Fi network, your Republic phone places it over Wi-Fi rather than using a costlier cellular phone network. The same is true of texts. You aren't limited to Wi-Fi calling and texting—the phone can make calls, send texts and connect to the Internet over Sprint's cellular network, at no extra charge. But Republic believes so many people connect their phones to Wi-Fi so often that most calls and other activity will be conducted over Wi-Fi, saving the company money on payments it makes to Sprint. And it says it has developed a system that properly places 911 calls over Wi-Fi, which has often been a problem. Wi-Fi phone calls aren't new, or unique to Republic. You can easily install an app on your iPhone or Android phone that will place calls over the Internet via Wi-Fi, just like Republic. But these apps generally require you to use a separate dialer and have a separate phone number. Republic's phone is what it calls a "hybrid" device—the main dialer and text-messaging modules have been configured to work on either Wi-Fi or the cellular network, without the need to launch an app. The phone defaults to Wi-Fi but will place the call over Sprint if it decides the Wi-Fi connection isn't good enough, or if you manually choose cellular. In my tests, conducted in and around Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Silicon Valley, call quality was adequate, text service worked normally, and Web browsing and apps mostly worked OK, at my home, office and public Wi-Fi hot spots in airports and coffee shops. But there were definite downsides. First is the phone itself. The Defy XT is a chunky device with a lower-resolution screen than any current iPhone or leading Android model. It comes with only about 2.5 gigabytes of usable storage, compared with a more typical 16 gigabytes on other phones, though you can expand the storage by buying a larger memory card. It has a relatively small 3.7 inch display. And when it isn't on Wi-Fi, it can only use an older-type, slow, 3G network. Plus, it runs a clunky, old version of Android called Gingerbread that was released two years ago. Republic says it plans to roll out several better phones running current versions of Android and much faster networks, including the best—4G LTE—starting in late summer. Second, there's no seamless handoff between Wi-Fi calls and cellular calls. If you leave a Wi-Fi coverage area, the call drops, and, after a brief but annoying delay, the phone will redial the call over Sprint. Republic says it plans to roll out a feature this summer that will cut the handoff to seconds and make it nearly seamless. Third is call quality. Wi-Fi calls have come a long way and in my tests, most were adequate, meaning the other person on the call and I could understand each other. But many of my calls had some slight echo effect or occasional clipped words, despite a recent software update intended to fix the problem. There was a noticeable improvement when I made the call on the same phone over Sprint. The phone even displays a button during calls, called informally "the escape hatch," which allows you to kill the Wi-Fi call and force the phone to redial the other person over Sprint for no added charge. But in general, I found the Wi-Fi calling acceptable, if not pristine, as long as I wasn't walking too far away from the Wi-Fi hot spot. Finally, there's almost no company-provided customer service. Republic relies on online forums of avid customers—its "community"—to provide help to users with problems. You can get help from an employee through these forums, but that's not typical. If you can live with these limitations, Republic Wireless can save you a lot of money. —Find all of Walt Mossberg's columns and videos at the All Things Digital website, walt.allthingsd.com.

Senators Tom Coburn, Richard Burr and Saxby Chambliss leave the dinner.
Getty Images President Barack Obama
stepped up his wooing of rank-and-file Republican lawmakers Wednesday, hosting a dozen senators at a dinner at a Washington restaurant and setting a visit to the Capitol in hopes of reigniting talks on a broad budget deal. The efforts mark his most aggressive outreach to lawmakers in years and show Mr. Obama
is trying to build his own coalition in Congress at a time when his past negotiating partners in the GOP leadership are under renewed pressure to accommodate the party's conservative base. Mr. Obama phoned a number of senators not in leadership positions over the weekend to gauge support for what has come to be known as a grand bargain on deficit reduction and other fiscal issues. One hurdle: Sharply different views on taxes. Mr. Obama has insisted that tax increases be part of any deal to rein in deficits, while many Republicans are open to tax increases only as part of a revenue-neutral broad reform of the tax code, in which tax rates would be reduced. "The heart of the discussion tonight was, 'How do we get there? How do we get people to come together and really effect the reforms?' " said Sen. John Hoeven
(R., N.D.), one of the dinner attendees. Mr. Hoeven said he saw the opportunity to reach a grand-bargain-style deal as the House and Senate work on their budgets for the next fiscal year and lawmakers face a May deadline for raising the federal borrowing limit. There is "a recognition we really need to do this in the next four- to five-month window. The key is to stay in this intense dialogue," Mr. Hoeven said. The dinner topics included the mandatory spending cuts known as the sequester, the continuing budget resolution passed Wednesday by the House to extend the government's funding past March 27, energy and an overhaul of the immigration system, Mr. Hoeven said. "The real focus was the debt and the deficit and how we come up with the kind of bipartisan reforms, tax reform and entitlement reform, that preserves and protects Social Security and Medicare, but that also enables us to deal with the debt and the deficit on a long-term basis," Mr. Hoeven added. Sen. Lindsey Graham
(R., S.C.), speaking before he attended the event, said that the president asked him to organize the dinner at the Jefferson Hotel and that he believed Mr. Obama was looking to start a substantive discussion. More House Approves Stopgap Budget Deal Forced Cuts Affecting Lawmakers' Offices, Too Live: Budget Battle Stream The White House is actively courting Mr. Graham because he has said he would be open to raising tax revenue as part of a larger deal that also would retool entitlement programs. A senior administration official said that "the president greatly enjoyed the dinner and had a good exchange of ideas with the senators." The White House said Mr. Obama paid for the meal from his own pocket, a move that, along with the neutral venue, seemed designed to show the president was reaching out. Some Republicans remained doubtful that Mr. Obama can strike a deal that would shore up Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs, reduce deficits and potentially overhaul the tax code. Some went so far as to dismiss the dinner as political theater. In addition to the dinner, the president has asked to address Republican and Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate next week. And in recent weeks he has stepped up contacts with business leaders, who could be important allies in maintaining momentum in the budget talks, should they begin in earnest. The overtures mark a departure for a president who has been criticized for shunning lawmakers, choosing instead to socialize and play golf with a small circle of friends and aides. One of the dinner invitees, Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), said in an interview beforehand that Mr. Obama showed little appetite for direct talks with lawmakers in his first term, but that his stance had shifted lately. "Whether that translates into action, I'm not sure," he said. "I want to work with the guy." One barrier is the high level of mutual distrust. Rare is the day in Washington when the two parties aren't blaming one another for gridlock. Related Video
On the day President Obama invited a group of Republican Senators to a private dinner, Sen. John McCain tells WSJ's Jerry Seib that such overtures are being "well received" and are a sign that the president "now is interested in outreach and dialogue."
Wednesday brought fresh examples: The Democratic National Committee launched a website blaming Republicans for what it said were hardships imposed by the automatic spending cuts known as the sequester, while House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) chided the administration for canceling tours of the White House due to the sequester cuts. Some Republicans who weren't invited questioned Mr. Obama's sincerity. "Call me cynical, but it just feels like, well, the media criticizes him, his approval ratings drop and suddenly he wants to talk," said Rep. Patrick Tiberi
(R., Ohio). Sen. John Thune
(R., S.D.), the Senate's No. 3 leader, wasn't invited to the dinner, but was more welcoming. "This seems to be a more general outreach than just trying to pick off a couple of Republican senators," he said. "So, hopefully, this will be more meaningful." Enlarge Image
The president, shown Tuesday, will meet with Congress on budget issues.
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Even some Democrats are doubtful that Mr. Obama's latest efforts will bear fruit. Senate Democrats believe the White House had far more leverage at the end of 2012, when Republicans were eager to avoid across-the-board tax increases under what was called the fiscal cliff. Mr. Obama hosted several gatherings with chief executives to seek input as he tried to reach a budget deal at the end of the year. After he gave a speech last week to CEOs at a Washington hotel, he lingered for nearly an hour for private discussions with the corporate leaders, moving table to table, said someone who was at the gathering. Senior Obama aides also have held conference calls with the chiefs of several dozen top companies, including Xerox Corp.

, according to participants on the calls. "The president and his aides realize they need as many allies as they can get for the four years ahead," said one executive who has been in the thick of the recent White House outreach campaign. Recent calls hosted by Obama advisers Valerie Jarrett
and Gene Sperling
have focused on concerns about the sequester and perceived sticking points in moving forward on an immigration overhaul, according to call participants.The most recent call was on Friday, the day the automatic budget cuts began. Several people who have been on the calls say the White House hasn't pushed business leaders to lobby Congress on the White House's behalf.An important question is whether the two sides can reach an understanding on how to use the revenue that a tax-code rewrite could generate. Generally, Republicans want to use it to lower tax rates while Democrats want to use it to forestall further spending cuts. The White House also plans to send first lady Michelle Obama and an array of top White House aides to talk next week to a Business Roundtable gathering of about 60 CEOs. Tax reform is a top priority for many Republicans, making it a potential bargaining chip as Mr. Obama and lawmakers decide whether they can sweep several budget questions into one set of talks. Those negotiations would include discretionary spending restraints, long-term entitlement reforms and "a process to get to pro-growth tax reform," said Sen. Rob Portman
(R., Ohio). Rep. Chris Van Hollen
(D., Md.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said recently some tax breaks could be eliminated as part of a deal to soften the effects of the sequester, which Democrats want, without undermining the longer-term goal of a tax-code overhaul. The GOP goal of lowering rates could become "part of the negotiation" over a tax rewrite, he added. —Neil King and John McKinnon contributed to this article.
