Por ANUPREETA DAS, BEN WORTHEN y SHARON TERLEP
Hewlett-Packard Co. ha recibido expresiones de interés por parte de posibles postores por su filial Autonomy Corp., la división que el gigante de tecnología ha afirmado que incurrió en prácticas contables irregulares antes de que H-P la adquiriera en 2011, según fuentes cercanas a las negociaciones. Las propuestas provienen principalmente de compañías estadounidenses de tecnología o sus representantes, señalaron las fuentes. Algunos potenciales compradores también han expresado interés en EDS, una firma de servicios tecnológicos que H-P adquirió por US$13.900 millones en 2008. La presidenta ejecutiva de H-P, Meg Whitman, no está interesada en vender, dijeron las fuentes. Pero H-P señaló en un reciente comunicado a los reguladores que consideraría desprenderse de algunos negocios "que podrían no ayudarnos a cumplir nuestros objetivos".

Updated Nov. 7, 2009 12:01 a.m. ET
On a bright Nov. 6 morning 140 years ago, a "jerky little train," as someone later described it, left Princeton, N.J., at 9 bound for New Brunswick, about 20 miles to the north. The "foot ball" players of the College of New Jersey or Nassau Hall—some just called it Princeton, but that official designation was 27 years away—stepped off the train and greeted their Rutgers hosts. After a midday stroll around town and some friendly games of billiards, the players from the two teams walked over to College Avenue and Sicard Street to a field that today is behind the Rutgers gymnasium (it was known as Bishop's Ground and wasn't even Rutgers property at the time). They then played a game of something vaguely resembling today's football, and from there it's pretty much been a straight line to tailgate parties, bowl games and million-dollar halftime shows. Well, perhaps not so much a straight line. Nothing is beautiful at birth, and the modern college-football fan might not find much to recognize in that so-called first game. Enlarge Image
William Boyd, Rutgers-Princeton football game of 1869.
Courtesy of Special Collections and University Archives, Rutgers University Libraries The two captains, William J. Leggett of Rutgers (class of '72 and later clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church—the phrase "muscular Christianity" was much in vogue) and William S. Gunmere (College of New Jersey class of '70, who would go on to become Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court) met before the game to discuss the rules, among which were "Goals must be 24 feet wide," "No tripping or holding of the players," and "Each side will be limited to 25 players." (According to the plaque that now hangs in the College Avenue Gym, Rutgers brought 27 players to Princeton's 23—no small achievement for Rutgers, which had a student body of just 141 to draw from, compared with 304 enrolled at the mighty football factory to their south.) Another rule, already understood by both sides, was that there were just two ways to advance the ball: kicking it and slapping or punching it. Picking up the ball and running with it would be a contribution of the Harvard team a few years later. The players varied in age from Rutgers's William James Hill, age 29, born in Ireland and a future seminary student, to John Herbert, age 16, later to become a lawyer and a Rutgers trustee. They were future admirals, judges and senators; one Rutgers man, John P. Clum, who may not have been in that first game but played for Rutgers in future games, became an Indian agent in the Arizona Territory, arrested Geronimo and, as mayor of Tombstone, was a close friend of Wyatt Earp. Rutgers men wore turbans of scarlet cloth; hence the football team's current nickname, the Scarlet Knights. One player, D.B. Williamson, later a New Brunswick architect, misunderstood the pregame instructions and began a college tradition by wearing a scarlet sweater. Princeton men dressed in sloppy street clothes—in other words, pretty much as Princeton students dress today. The captains initiated yet another tradition by flipping a coin to see who would kick off. Princeton won the coin toss, and the game began at about 3 p.m. After perhaps 90 heart-pounding minutes, interrupted a few times for repairs to the small round rubber game ball—no one thought to bring a back-up ball—the game came to what one player later recalled as a "crashing end." Rutgers won, six goals, or points, to four. (You scored by kicking the ball between the posts, as there were no cross bars.) Baseball historians have never been able to agree on the "first" baseball game, but most football historians are on comfortable turf in pinpointing the start of their game with Rutgers-Princeton in 1869. Some have called that contest "primitive football," some describe it as "primitive soccer," and still others as "nascent rugby." In truth, claims can be made for all these descriptions. But as Bob Boyles, co-author of the USA Today College Football Encyclopedia, says: "There are a great many traditions that started on that field in New Brunswick. The kicking factor, the goal posts, the physical contact—the men allowed to run 'interference,' an early term for what we call blocking—that pull that game towards the direction of American football and away from soccer or rugby." Rutgers archivist Tom Frusciano notes the number of off-the-field football traditions that began with that game. "There were students along the sidelines rooting their team along with college songs and cheers. That was probably the origin of the cheering sections you see at football games today." One of those students may well have been the inspiration for Mr. Magoo, the cartoon character often seen in a raccoon coat and carrying a Rutgers pennant whose voice was that of actor Jim Backus. According to one of the show's writers, his creators wanted Mr. Magoo to be "a college alumnus who was still fired up with the old school spirit . . . Rutgers was the embodiment of the 'old school tie' in America." Rutgers alumnus Steve Greene, who is researching a book on football in 1869, believes that "If you traced a line of dominoes from this year's Super Bowl back in time, the first domino in the line would be Rutgers-Princeton, 1869." Mr. Greene notes that the game even had the first known critic of college football, a man riding by on a bicycle who stopped to watch and shouted to the players before riding on, "You men will come to no Christian end!" Mr. Greene says that "he was probably a Rutgers professor." The 1869 Rutgers-Princeton game was also the origin of one very important staple of college football, namely "Braggin' Rights." The following week, Princeton won the rematch, 8-0, and in fact Rutgers would lose the next 31 contests. To date, in 71 games against Princeton, Rutgers's record is just 17-53-1."But we won the first one," says Mr. Greene, "and nothing can ever change that." —Mr. Barra writes about sports for the Journal.

Seattle Genetics Inc. said its novel blood-cancer treatment, which attacks cancerous cells but ignores healthy ones, shrank tumors in three-quarters of patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to a study of 102 patients released Monday. The drug, called brentuximab vedotin, in development with Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., is part of a generation of biotechnology therapies that aims to bolster chemotherapy's effectiveness while reducing its damaging side effects. Chemotherapy is usually given to a patient as a systemic treatment, meaning it travels through the entire body. While killing cancer cells, it also kills other cells and often makes patients very ill. Brentuximab vedotin is a type of drug often referred to as an antibody conjugate. It is a cell-killing drug attached to a type of cancer-targeting antibody so that the drug seeks the cancer and kills it. The theory is that harmless cells aren't affected, thus lowering the drug's toxicity. Seattle Genetics is also studying its use in earlier forms of the disease and in other blood cancers. While the study's data show the drug's success, analysts also highlight that it validates the company's technology related to making antibody conjugates and the future of such drugs. In the trial, which involved 102 patients who had previously received other cancer treatments, 75% of patients responded to the drug, with the median duration of response exceeding six months. Those who responded to the treatment either saw their tumors disappear completely or had a 50% or greater reduction in tumor volume. The company plans to present more complete data at a future scientific meeting. "Few agents have demonstrated this level of clinical response," Chief Executive Clay Siegall said. "We are particularly encouraged by these results given that all patients had failed multiple lines of therapy."Mr. Siegall said that a patient response of 30% or higher would have been viewed as a success in the trial. The company plans to file for Food and Drug Administration approval in the first half of 2011 using the data, with a potential launch in the U.S. in the second half. Takeda is talking with European regulators about submitting the data for approval next year. Although hopes are high for the future of antibody-drug conjugates, Michael Rosenblum, head of the immunopharmacology and targeted therapy lab at the University of Texas's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, notes that further studies will determine the level of their success. "These agents have come a long way and it is nice to see the field evolving," Dr. Rosenblum said, "Right now, we would anticipate that is a whole new class that has broad applicability, but I think we are going to find that it has its own built-in set of best applications and limitations." Hodgkin's lymphoma is a cancer that begins in a type of white blood cell and is curable in 75% of patients. About 8,500 new cases are expected in the U.S. during 2010 along with 1,320 deaths, according to the National Cancer Institute. Needham & Co. estimates peak annual world-wide sales of $400 million to $500 million in use of the drug for Hodgkin's lymphoma alone. Seattle Genetics developed a linking mechanism that connects the cell-killing drug with the antibody so they don't separate until they enter the tumor cell. Brentuximab vedotin seeks a target called CD30, which is on the cell surface of several types of blood cancers, but is less common on normal tissue. The company licenses the technology and has collected more than $130 million in payments. It is also using the technology in a number of other drugs in its pipeline. The idea of adding drugs as payload to an antibody has been in the works for decades, Dr. Rosenblum said, but has proved frustrating to achieve mostly because of the instability of the link mechanism. In 1997 when Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. decided to end its efforts in the field, Mr. Siegall and another former Bristol-Myers scientist formed Seattle Genetics with technology they licensed from their former company. In June, Pfizer Inc. pulled the only antibody conjugate drug that was on the market, a drug called MyloTarg that was approved by the FDA in 2000. The leukemia treatment caused severe side effects and further research raised questions about its effectiveness. Many have blamed the drug's unstable linking technology for the toxicity. Seattle Genetics said in a statement that its drug's side effects were "generally consistent with prior clinical trial experience." A previous trial showed side effects including fatigue, fever, diarrhea and nausea. The drug is similar in concept to Roche Holding AG's trastuzumab-DM1, or T-DM1, being developed with ImmunoGen Inc., which has also developed a linking mechanism That drug attaches a cell-killing agent to breast-cancer blockbuster Herceptin, but it recently had a setback when the FDA rejected its accelerated approval application. Roche expects to make a new submission by mid-2012. Mr. Siegall stressed that Seattle Genetics has worked with the FDA in developing the trials for brentuximab vedotin and is confident of its eventual approval. Furthermore, he said the delay for T-DM1 wasn't related to it being an antibody conjugate, but was more related to the number of breast-cancer treatments already available. The brentuximab vedotin study was conducted under a special protocol assessment, an agreement with the FDA on the study's design. The drug has orphan drug status in the U.S. and Europe, meaning the governments provide drug makers with incentives to develop new treatments for diseases with smaller patient populations. Seattle Genetics and Takeda are also conducting several other trials of brentuximab vedotin, including a phase II trial for advanced anaplastic large cell lymphoma, another type of blood cancer, that is expected to have data in coming weeks.
