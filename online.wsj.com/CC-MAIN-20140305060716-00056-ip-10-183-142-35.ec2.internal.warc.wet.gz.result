Dear Judge, Gupta Is a Good Man
Bill Gates, Kofi Annan Among Those Writing in Support of Inside Tipster Ahead of His Sentencing
By
Michael Rothfeld
Updated Oct. 12, 2012 7:47 p.m. ET
Rajat Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. director convicted of insider trading, has lost his powerful spots on corporate boards, his reputation and likely his freedom when a judge sentences him later this month. But Mr. Gupta, 63 years old, still has plenty of powerful backers, including Bill Gates and Kofi Annan, and they are lining up...

Updated Feb. 2, 2011 12:01 a.m. ET
A co-op apartment inherited by a Nepalese butler, Indra B. Tamang,
at the Dakota, one of the most famous apartment buildings in New York, has found a buyer for under $4.5 million, brokers said. Mr. Tamang, who came to New York from Nepal nearly four decades ago to work for a socially prominent family, inherited an estate valued in court papers at $8.4 million, including two separate apartments at the Dakota. The co-op apartments were bequeathed to Mr. Tamang by Ruth Ford,
a film and stage actress who died in 2009 at the age of 98. She was the wife of Zachary Scott,
the Hollywood star. Mr. Tamang worked as a butler, cook and caretaker for the family beginning in the 1970s. But Mr. Tamang put the larger of the two apartments on the market to help pay inheritance tax due on the estate. He has said he had hopes of keeping the smaller studio where Ms. Ford's brother, Charles Henri Ford,
a surrealist poet and artist, had lived. The larger apartment, with three bedrooms, a living room and dining room, was listed for $7.5 million when it first went on the market in December 2009. The asking price was gradually cut to a low of $4.5 million, after a change in brokers, the following April. It lingered on the market for so long, brokers said, because the apartment was priced too high, especially considering that it faced north and lacked the much-coveted views of Central Park of many other apartments in the building. The most recent listing by Dolly Lenz,
of Prudential Douglas Elliman, noted it had "angular views of the park." The sale price wasn't known, but was said to be close to the lowest asking price of $4.5 million. Last June—as the market for luxury apartments picked up—the asking price had been raised to $4.95 million. The lower sale price suggests that the estate may be worth considerably less than originally set out in court papers, because of declining values of real estate and artwork from peak prices several years ago. The Dakota, built in the 1880s with steep gables around a central courtyard, has been the home to many famous names in entertainment and the arts, including Leonard Bernstein,
Lauren Bacall
and Judy Garland.
The listing said that Ms. Ford had turned her home into a salon where many prominent theater people gathered. It said that the idea behind the musical "West Side Story" was hatched during a chance encounter during one such occasion in her apartment. But in recent decades, the building's board and many residents have been publicity shy, especially after John Lennon
was fatally shot in the entrance to the building in 1980, and the building turned into a Mecca for tourists. When Mr. Tamang's inheritance drew attention to the building, a number of brokers said that they expected that the finicky board with its high standards and aversion to notoriety would reject him if he applied to live there. So far he has not done so. But the board, which usually operates under a deep cloak of anonymity, issued a rare statement saying that Mr. Tamang's "prior capacity as an employee of a Dakota resident would not adversely affect our decision about his residing here." "We at The Dakota are proud that for many years ours has been an extraordinarily diverse community of residents," the statement said. Mr. Tamang also owns a house in Queens he purchased with help from the Ford family, and his current plans aren't known. Mr. Tamang didn't return a phone message left Tuesday and a lawyer for the estate declined to comment. Mr. Tamang grew up in a mud house in a farming village in Nepal, and was brought to New York in 1974 by Charles Ford, who had lived for several years in a house in Katmandu. He said he shopped and cooked for Mr. Ford and looked after him as they traveled around the world. He took up photography and collaborated with Mr. Ford on collages and other works of art. Mr. Ford died in 2002. Since his inheritance has become known, Mr. Tamang has raised his public profile a bit, maintaining a blog, where he comments on world events, his views on life, and displays his recent photographs, including images of chained bicycles covered in snow. A Jan. 17 post includes an excerpt from a newspaper interview where he shares his recollections about Mr. Lennon at the Dakota. He said he still sees Yoko Ono in the building and she is "always charming." Write to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com Email

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg described recent visits to communities in the Rockaways and Staten Island to assess damage and relief efforts in the hardest hit areas of the five boroughs.
The problem loomed as wintry weather descended on the region, endangering hundreds of thousands of other people whose homes were intact but didn't have electricity they needed to heat their homes. Enlarge Image
Mira Satryan left the Rockaway Beach parking lot, which is serving as a location for volunteers, where she found some warm dry clothing.
PJ Smith for The Wall Street Journal Temperatures in the region are roughly 10 degrees below normal—mid to low 30s at night—and the National Weather Service forecasts a coastal storm will likely hit the area Wednesday and Thursday, possibly bringing heavy precipitation, high winds and more coastal flooding. While authorities have made headway on easing a gasoline shortage and mass transit woes, they were pivoting to figure out how to get roofs over the heads of people displaced by Sandy—a daunting issue in a dense region without much vacant housing. Officials didn't yet know just how many people would need a new place to live and for how long. Photos: Life After Sandy

Getty Images "We don't belong here," said a tearful Susan Clingen, 53 years old, who was staying in a shelter Sunday after floodwaters destroyed the Queens home she shared with her husband. "A lot of people here, their lights are out. We have nothing. Where do we go? All I know is I'm with him and that's all that matters." The national death toll from Sandy stood at 110 on Sunday. A spokesman for the American Red Cross, which faced criticism immediately after the storm for what some officials said was a slow response, said the charity understands the frustration but attributed the delay to "challenging conditions in the disaster area that prevented aid from getting in as quickly as anyone would have wanted, including the American Red Cross." "We know that people have high expectations of the Red Cross and we understand that and it keeps us on our toes," the spokesman said. Enlarge Image
Residents of Staten Island, a borough of New York City and one of the hardest hit by Sandy, warmed themselves on Sunday.
Reuters Sandy decimated neighborhoods in both New York and New Jersey. More than 182,000 residents of those two states and Connecticut had registered for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency as of Sunday, a spokesman said. The government had approved $158 million in assistance funding. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
said Sunday that 30,000 to 40,000 people in the city were made homeless by Sandy. About half of those are residents of public-housing projects in which wind-driven sand and water knocked out infrastructure such as boilers and electrical systems. Enlarge Image
Power in public housing was hard hit by Sandy. Volunteers Steve Schall, left, his wife, Amy Russo, and their son Nate, 11, deliver meals to a homebound resident of the Red Hook Houses.

The mayor estimated that roughly 20,000 New Yorkers could still be homeless in two weeks. In New Jersey, officials didn't estimate how many people were without homes. More than 5,000 people were staying in shelters Sunday, according to FEMA. Many more were likely staying with friends and family.

Photo: Getty Images.
"This is going to be a massive, massive housing problem," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo
said. "And you're going to need a number of options for a number of situations—short-term, long-term, so it's going to be a true challenge. We'll get through it, but it's a true challenge." Officials said they were taking a series of steps to find places for the newly homeless to live, though they warned it might not be possible for people to stay near their old homes. Some would be housed in hotels, an aide to Mr. Bloomberg said. Speaking in New Jersey, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano
said the government would pay for temporary housing in apartments. The government's goal, she said, "is to get people out of the shelters now as quickly as possible." On the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, people spoke Sunday about enduring the coldest night yet since the storm left the area without electricity, heat and potable water for the seventh straight day. The entire peninsula, home to 130,000 people, was without electricity Sunday and likely wouldn't get it for back for at least three days, according to the Long Island Power Authority. Relief crews had set up at least five distribution centers in the area, handing out food, water, blankets and flashlights. Many who planned to stay in their homes spent the day in search of blankets and warmer clothes with plans to layer and huddle together in hopes of riding out the wait until power and heat were restored. Others were preparing to leave. Daniel and Laura Flores decided to abandon their apartment in a public-housing project and stay with a daughter in Brooklyn. "It's too cold," Mr. Flores said. "The first few days after the storm was not too bad, but last night was horrible. The development is made of concrete and it just holds in the cold. It was just bitter cold. It was going through your bones." At the same time, a gasoline shortage lingered, continuing to strain tensions around the region. Lines outside some filling stations stretched for more than a mile. Mr. Cuomo said problems still persisted with gasoline delivery and distribution, meaning that the shortage wouldn't end for a "couple of days". Sandy put a number of kinks in the region's gasoline distribution system: It forced New York Harbor to close—preventing fuel tankers from entering—damaged terminals and pipelines and knocked out power to gas stations. The harbor has since re-opened. "There will be more of a supply of gasoline and more of a distribution," Mr. Cuomo said. "That does not mean there will be a total alleviation of the problem in the immediate future, but it is getting better." Mass-transit problems were expected to stretch into the coming week. Commuter rail service in New Jersey was limited. The Long Island Rail Road, bringing commuters from the eastern suburbs, has sputtered to life with a limited schedule, and the Metro-North line, for commuters north of New York, was close to full service. New York City's subway system wasn't yet back to normal. Workers continued pumping out subway tunnels, drying and reinstalling equipment and testing power supplies in advance of the Monday morning commute.The morning rush will be the biggest test yet for the subways, which carry 5.5 million riders on an average weekday. It won't run a full complement of trains because of lingering damage to underwater tunnels, washed out tracks near the coastline, and damaged stations and track equipment. —Laura Nahmias, Alison Fox, Josh Dawsey, Christopher Weaver and Ted Mann contributed to this article.

Scientists have converted human skin cells into brain cells and used them to treat mice with myelin disorders, a family of diseases that includes multiple sclerosis. The research, reported Thursday, marks another promising advance for a technique known as cell reprogramming. The approach returns mature cells to an embryonic-like state, and then transforms them into various types of fresh, healthy tissue that could be used to treat diseases. Multiple sclerosis is the most common myelin disorder. It strikes when the body's own immune system attacks myelin, the coating around nerve fibers. That disrupts communication between cells and can cause problems related to muscle movement, balance and vision. In the latest study, the reprogramming technique "led to the re-myelination of the complete nervous system" of diseased animals, improving their symptoms and prolonging their life, said Steven Goldman, lead author of the report and a neurologist at University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, N.Y. The findings appear in the journal Cell Stem Cell. Myelin is made in cells known as oligodendrocytes. Those, in turn, are the offspring of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, or OPCs. One way to tackle a malady like multiple sclerosis is to transplant healthy, lab-made OPCs into the diseased brain, which could restore the lost myelin and reverse the damage from the disease. Dr. Goldman's team first reprogrammed human skin cells into embryonic-like stem cells. Then they identified the cascade of chemical signals used by the body to turn embryonic cells into OPCs—and replicated that process in a lab dish. It was hard to do, mainly because OPCs form very late in the body's development, via a multistage and complex process. It took the researchers six years to decipher the signals and to produce and purify enough OPCs that would yield sufficient myelin. The OPCs were transplanted into mice with leukodystrophy, a hereditary condition that rendered them incapable of producing myelin. (Each year, thousands of children are born in the U.S. with some form of leukodystrophy.) In the experiment, untreated mice displayed the typical symptoms of myelin-loss as they grew older: They developed tremors, lost their sense of balance and died prematurely, often from seizures. The treated group initially also developed tremors and other symptoms. But once the transplanted cells began to produce sufficient myelin—it took four months—their symptoms improved and they no longer died of seizures. Dr. Goldman said he hopes to start human trials using the cell-transplantation approach in 2015. Write to Gautam Naik at gautam.naik@wsj.com Email

A gas explosion triggered a large fire Tuesday evening near an upscale shopping-and-entertainment district in Kansas City, Mo., injuring several people, police said. The fire began around 6 p.m. local time and emergency responders had largely extinguished it within a couple of hours, but the exact extent of the damage and injuries wasn't immediately clear. Kansas City fire spokesman James Garrett
said at least 14 people had sustained injuries, including nine transported to area hospitals. Mr. Garrett told CNN that there were no immediate fatalities, but two victims had life-threatening injuries. He said authorities were investigating reports that some people were unaccounted for.

KCTV/Associated Press The University of Kansas Hospital is treating five victims of the explosion, including two in serious condition and one in critical condition, a hospital spokesman said. The two other patients walked into the hospital. The five victims' injuries are related to blunt-force trauma, he said. The hospital is expecting two more victims with serious burn injuries, he said. Missouri Gas Energy said in a statement that an investigation into the explosion is ongoing but "early indications are that a contractor doing underground work struck a natural gas line." The company said the area has been secured and the flow of gas stopped. The fire was largely contained around JJ's Restaurant, which sits just west of the Country Club Plaza district. At about 7 p.m. local time, Kansas City Mayor Sly James
wrote on Twitter that the fire was mostly under control and that the city's fire department and gas company were working to prevent secondary explosions. Write to Jack Nicas at jack.nicas@wsj.com Email

SNOW CONES | A twist in the track at Colorado's Bridgestone Winter Driving School
Bridgestone Winter Driving School WHEN I WAS 16, my dad threatened to take me out on a frozen lake and "really teach me to drive." We lived in Minnesota, on top of a large and often icy hill, and he said he didn't want to see the family car stuck in a snowbank at the bottom. I left home before he was able to finish off my driver's education, but 17 years later, I found myself in an SUV, queued up with four others, waiting my turn to practice driving through a maze of snow banks and ice. I had enrolled in an ice driving class at Bridgestone Winter Driving School in Colorado, whose track is built on ranchland eight miles from Steamboat Ski Resort. Unlike most winter driving schools, Bridgestone foregoes frozen lakes for ice- and snow-covered courses to mimic winter driving conditions. Over the past three decades, more than 80,000 people have tackled winter driving at Bridgestone. Presumably, so could I. Enlarge Image
SUVs in wait
Bridgestone Winter Driving School I live in a Colorado mountain town and drive a low-clearance, front-wheel-drive hatchback with all-season tires. The night before my class, heading down a slick road, my car slid to the left. I turned the wheel right, but the car kept going left. I turned the wheel more, then I slipped right. Snow banks loomed through dusky light; in my panic, I let go of the steering wheel. It unwound and, miraculously, the tires gained traction. I took hold of the wheel and eased my foot onto the gas. My heart still beating hard, I wondered what I should have done. I could only hope ice driving school would teach me. The following day, I was introduced to instructors who looked like normal people but had secret lives as rally car drivers and professional racers. Everything made sense in the classroom when our instructor, Lea Croteau,
drew diagrams on the white board: what to do when the car doesn't respond, easing the car out of a skid, avoiding a crash. Enlarge Image
A vehicle pushes through the snow.
Bridgestone Winter Driving School It got a little trickier out on the course, where we were told to drive in tight circles on icy hills without spinning out. Muscle memory took over and I drove like I always had. Instead of recovering from a skid, I braked and skidded more. After four hours practicing the new techniques, all I'd nailed was pumping the brakes to come to a stop on icy roads. My next task was to steer around a line of orange cones without braking. The car ahead of me sneaked up on the cones and swerved right, then left and smoothly around a turn at the bottom of the hill. I inched toward the starting line. "Alissa, you're up," said Ms. Croteau. The Lowdown: Bridgestone Winter Driving School Getting There: Steamboat Springs, Colo., is located about 3½ hours by car from Denver. The Yampa Valley Regional Airport, a half-hour drive away, offers direct service from cities including Newark and Houston. Staying There: Classes meet at the Steamboat Grand Hotel, with shuttle service to the track. After class, head over to the illuminated Ice Castle, a local attraction made from thousands of icicles. Learning There: Bridgestone offers daily classes between mid-December and early March, with the exception of Christmas Day. Anyone with a driver's permit or license can sign up, no matter their age. From $480 for a daylong class, winterdrive.com She watched from the bottom of the track, where she was seated in her own car and giving instructions over a two-way radio. Our group of 10 had been split up into five pairs. My partner was a teenager in aviator glasses. I'd initially feared he was too young and would drive fast. We worked well together, taking turns behind the wheel. At our teacher's cue, I accelerated to 25 miles per hour, which felt much faster on down-sloping ice. I stepped off the gas and turned the wheel to the right, then left. I skirted the cones but the car tried to do a 180. We slid downhill sideways. I felt stuck in slow-motion, unable to respond. The instructor's voice told me how to regain control, but I couldn't focus on her words—I was too busy looking at her car, and hoping I didn't hit it. I braked when I should have accelerated, just missing the vehicle and sliding into a second row of orange cones before coming to a stop. My next try was better. Ms. Croteau coached me to let the steering wheel go back to center after I cleared the orange cones. The car gained traction without spinning out, and I accelerated to maneuver around the turn. "You don't have to wait for the car to find traction," she said. "You can step on the gas to help the wheels stick sooner." After a few tries, I almost had it down. I was not ready to quit when it was Mr. Aviator's turn. I climbed into the passenger seat, my brain fuzzy from all the new information, and wondered: Am I a better driver now? At the end of the day, the instructors let the entire class drive the course at once. Mr. Aviator and I traded the SUV for a front-wheel-drive sedan similar to my own car. I drove first, slowing to 15 mph at the turns. My partner directed me to go faster. I let go of my hesitation. Suddenly everything clicked. I kept the speedometer near 20 and 25 on turns, hit 45 on straightaways and didn't worry about spinning out. The wheels humming over snow and ice, I smiled. My dad never told me winter driving could be such fun. Email
