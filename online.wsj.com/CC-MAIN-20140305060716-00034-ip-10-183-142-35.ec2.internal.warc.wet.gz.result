     By Judy McKinnon 
 Canadian regional- and corporate-jet maker Bombardier Inc. (BBD.B.T) said Thursday it will offer an extra-capacity seating option on its new CSeries aircraft, allowing the CS300 model to accommodate up to 160 passengers. Montreal-based Bombardier, which is unveiling its new single-aisle Cseries Thursday, said the extra-capacity option, which requires the addition of a second pair of over-wing exit doors, will be available both in-production and as a retrofit. The company said Latvia-based airBaltic has already chosen the extra-capacity seating option. "Our main focus continues to be the development, optimization and marketing of the CSeries family of aircraft in the 100- to 149-seat market segment," Mike Arcamone, president of Bombardier Commercial Aircraft, said in a statement. The increased capacity option is a result of "keen customer interest and market trends," he said. Bombardier's new CSeries aircraft aim to compete with the smallest jets of its bigger rivals, Boeing Co. (BA) and Airbus (ABI.YY). Bombardier is targeting the first CSeries flight by the end of June and has said deliveries will begin in the first half of 2014. As of the end of December, the company said it had booked orders and commitments for 382 CSeries aircraft, including firm orders for 148 CSeries airliners.

This is part of a series in which readers tell us about their favorite trips and destinations. Send us your suggestions at encore@wsj.com. Approaching our 40th wedding anniversary, I knew that my wife, Jane, wanted to go somewhere special. What I found was Al Petrogallo, an Italian farmhouse built in 1571—exactly 400 years before we married in 1971. She was impressed. Journal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/Encore More in Encore: The New Retirement Summer Fun: The Best Camps for Grown-Ups The Hazards of Going Home From the Hospital How to Ease the Tax Bite on Your Social Security Benefits The Big Squeeze: More Pressure on the 'Sandwich' Generation Vote
Al Petrogallo is in Umbria, near the Tuscan border in central Italy. I discovered it on agriturismo.it, a website about Italian country homes, and began corresponding by email with Antonella, daughter of the owner. Antonella said we would enjoy walking along the Tiber River and visiting nearby Umbertide. She recommended exploring the cities of Gubbio, Assisi and Perugia as well. In early September 2011, we flew to Rome and then boarded three consecutive trains to Umbertide, where Antonella met us. The farm itself is a collection of three buildings with eight bedrooms, set amid wheat fields and sunflowers. Our apartment was roomy (about 900 square feet) and modern, yet lovingly restored with brick, tile and timber. Enlarge Image
For their 40th anniversary the Blakewells stayed at an Italian farmhouse built in 1571.
Roger Blakewell Poolside, we met guests from Germany, Belgium, Poland and the Netherlands. We enjoyed evenings together sampling local wine and cheese. We also met Antonella's sister, mother and father. It was her father, Mario, who had renovated the old home. With the farm as our base, we began exploring a region steeped in history. As planned, we walked on the dirt path along the Tiber River to Umbertide, where we wandered through the colorful farmers market. (Among our favorite discoveries: porchetta, roasted pork on a fresh, hard-crusted roll.) One day Antonella's brother-in-law, Andre, kindly drove us to Gubbio, where he worked. In the middle of a conversation about the town's Roman influences and medieval architecture, we rounded a curve and came upon both—a Roman theater and, behind it, the walled city, whose narrow streets and stone buildings gave us a glimpse of the Middle Ages. Then it was on to Perugia and Assisi. The former features an ancient underground city (reached by modern-day escalators). Tunnel-like walkways take visitors back to the times of the Etruscans, who predated the Romans. Assisi, of course, is the birthplace of St. Francis. As we made our way along hilly streets there lined with quaint shops, we reached the basilica that bears his name—and found ourselves watching a wedding party. The link to our marriage four decades earlier was perfect. The week went all too fast. We went on to Rome, but our best memories return to the farmhouse along the Tiber. Mr. Blakewell is a retiree in Florida and Wisconsin who teaches college English. He can be reached at encore@wsj.com. Email

Biography
Updated Jan. 31, 2014 9:35 p.m. ET
Proving that you can gamble on pretty much anything at the Super Bowl, the creative geniuses in Las Vegas have set an over/under on how many times Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning will shout "Omaha!" during Sunday's game: 27.5. Manning is legendary for his histrionics and vocalizations at the line of scrimmage, but his constant use of the word "Omaha" on national television during the playoffs has gone viral. A collection of local companies have pledged to donate $1,700 for every time Manning name drops their city Sunday, while Omaha Steaks has even considered offering Manning an endorsement deal. So how should fans bet? If recent history provides any guidance, take the over. The Journal counted every instance of "Omaha" during the Broncos' two postseason games. Both times, Manning surpassed 27.5, using the signal 44 times in the AFC divisional round against the San Diego Chargers and then 31 times in the conference championship against the New England Patriots. Nobody knows for sure what "Omaha" means. It could be an audible. It could be a snap count. It could be a nonsense word that means nothing at all. Manning, of course, won't reveal his secrets. "Well, Omaha, it's a run play," Manning said before the AFC championship game. "But it could be a pass play, or a play-action pass, depending on a couple of things: the wind, which way we're going, the quarter, and the jerseys that we're wearing," One thing that can thwart prospective bettors: Now that Omaha has gotten so much attention, Manning may just change the word altogether. How would "East Rutherford!" sound on TV a few dozen times? —Jared Diamond

Workers in Spain and Italy are the least skilled among 24 developed countries surveyed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a deficit that is likely to impede the ability of those two countries to boost their competitiveness as part of efforts to overcome the euro-zone fiscal crisis. In a report that covered a wide range of countries, the OECD also concluded that in both the U.S. and the U.K., younger people are significantly less-skilled relative to their peers than older people, while Japan and Finland boast the most-skilled workers. Skills Testing Workers in Spain and Italy were the least skilled among the 24 developed countries surveyed by the OECD for proficiency in literacy and numeracy

Related Article Younger Americans Fare Poorly on Skills Against International Peers OECD Report Most assessments of the quality of human capital available to national economies have focused on time spent in education. The OECD's study is the most extensive effort to date to measure the skills acquired during education. For Spain and Italy, its conclusions are chastening. Both economies have suffered from a loss of competitiveness over the past decade, resulting in large trade deficits and high levels of borrowing. To return to strong growth, generate trade surpluses and pay off their debts, their competitive position will have to improve. But according to the OECD, Italy ranks bottom, and Spain second-to-last among the 24 countries in literacy skills. Over one in five adults in both countries can't read as well as a 10-year-old child would be expected to in most education systems. In a ranking of numeracy skills, the positions are reversed, with Spain bottom, and Italy second-to-last. That means one in three adults have only the most basic numeracy skills—a fate shared by their U.S. counterparts. "If you measure Spain by the number of university degrees, it looks good," said Andreas Schleicher,
deputy director for education and skills at the OECD. "But that doesn't tell the truth. The skill base will limit the capacity to grow." Spain's government said the report's results underscore the need for broad educational changes that improve student performance, making workers more employable. Skills Testing Percentage of adults, age 16-65, scoring above average in the study Spain U.K. U.S. Literacy 32.5 49 45.7 Numeracy 28.6 41 34.4 Source: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development survey conducted between August 2011 and March 2012 "Over the last decades all the emphasis has been placed on schooling students from an early age through university, but not enough attention has been paid to the quality of education," said Montserrat Gomendio, deputy education minister. Italy faces an even greater challenge. Not only does it have fewer highly skilled workers than most other economies, it also uses them badly—or in the case of many highly skilled women, not at all. "Even the highly skilled are not well used," said Mr. Schleicher. The economies of Italy and Spain both contracted last year, and are forecast by the European Commission to shrink again this year, before returning to modest growth in 2014. Enlarge Image

Reuters There is some encouragement for Spain in that younger people are more skilled relatively to their peer group than older people. Indeed, in terms of literacy, Spain is second only to South Korea to have registered the greatest improvement over time. The U.K. and the U.S. have made the least progress in improving skills over time, an indication that their economies may grow more slowly in the future than those of other countries. According to the OECD study, in both countries skills are below the average of the 24. In the U.K., people aged 16 to 24 have exactly the same level of literacy as their grandparents, while in the U.S., there has been only a modest improvement over the generations. As a result, the U.S. share of highly skilled workers has fallen to 28% in the 16-24 age group from 42% in the 55-65 age group. "In the U.S., the older generation was one of the most highly skilled, but the younger generation does worse than average," said Mr. Schleicher. However, both the U.S. and the U.K. are exceptionally good at ensuring that workers' skills are fully exploited, ensuring that their respective skills deficits don't translate into a growth gap with other leading economies. "The U.S. and England are very good at extracting the maximum out of their higher skilled worker force," said Mr. Schleicher. By contrast, Japanese workers are the most skilled in the 24-nation survey, but don't fully employ many of those skills, particularly because they are denied the opportunity to use their problem-solving abilities in what the OECD calls a "technology environment." The OECD attributes that to the relative inflexibility of Japan's job markets. It does suggest that if Japan were able to fully use its workers' skills, it could generate higher rates of economic growth, having long stagnated. The OECD surveyed 166,000 adults between August 2011 and March 2012. —Ilan Brat contributed to this article. Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com Email

Libya to Retool Security for Diplomats
By
Margaret Coker
Updated Dec. 26, 2012 5:20 p.m. ET
BENGHAZI, Libya—Libyan authorities plan to create a specialized diplomatic security unit as part of a larger overhaul of security services, according to Libyan officials briefed on the new government proposals, in part to help stanch growing international criticism about Libya's response to the anti-American attacks in Benghazi. The deadly violence that erupted on Sept. 11 exposed dysfunction within Libya's security forces, where commanders often have little control over the actions of their men and have had little...

Janet Yellen, a Top Contender at the Fed, Faces Test Over Easy Money
By
Jon Hilsenrath
Updated May 12, 2013 11:04 p.m. ET
The next chief of the Federal Reserve will decide when to reverse the easy-money policies of Ben Bernanke, a judgment that could strangle the economic recovery if made too early or trigger runaway inflation if made too late. The task could fall to Fed vice-chairwoman Janet Yellen, a meticulous and demanding Yale-trained economist, who issued prescient, early warnings about the housing bust. After the financial crisis, she helped...

Truman Capote, center, with Harper Lee and Alvin Dewey in 1966
Steve Schapiro/Corbis GARDEN CITY, Kan.—
Truman Capote's
masterwork of murder, "In Cold Blood," cemented two reputations when first published almost five decades ago: his own, as a literary innovator, and detective Alvin Dewey Jr.
's as the most famous Kansas lawman since Wyatt Earp. But new evidence undermines Mr. Capote's claim that his best seller was an "immaculately factual" recounting of the bloody slaughter of the Clutter family in their Kansas farmhouse. It also calls into question the image of Mr. Dewey as the brilliant, haunted hero. Photos: A Look Back at Truman Capote
View Slideshow
Truman Capote in 1980
Getty Images A long-forgotten cache of Kansas Bureau of Investigation documents from the investigation into the deaths suggests that the events described in two crucial chapters of the 1966 book differ significantly from what actually happened. Separately, a contract reviewed and authenticated by The Wall Street Journal shows that Mr. Capote in 1965 required Columbia Pictures to offer Mr. Dewey's wife a job as a consultant to the film version of his book for a fee far greater than the U.S. median family income that year. In researching "In Cold Blood," Truman Capote received first-class service from the KBI and Mr. Dewey, its lead detective on the case. Mr. Dewey gave the author access to the diary of 16-year-old Nancy Clutter
—her final entry logged only moments before two strangers invaded her home in late 1959 and murdered her, her brother and her parents. Mr. Dewey opened the KBI's case file to Mr. Capote. He pressured press-shy locals to cooperate with the author and granted him extraordinary access to the killers. Mr. Dewey even helped Mr. Capote, a New Yorker with no home in Kansas, obtain a Kansas driver's license. Related Reading Did the Clutter Murderers Kill Again? And Mr. Capote's book painted Mr. Dewey as the investigator who led the KBI's brilliant cracking of the case, and the KBI as a model agency. But at a key moment in the 1959 investigation, when 19 days of utter bafflement ended with an informant stepping forward and naming the killers, the KBI didn't snap to action, according to the new documents. It didn't, as Mr. Capote's book says, dispatch an agent that very night to the Kansas farmhouse where one of the suspects had been living with his parents. Instead, the KBI waited five days to visit that farmhouse, according to the KBI documents. The details are to be found in papers from the Clutter case that a now-deceased KBI agent, Harold Nye,
carried home with him years ago. Those documents, reviewed in August by the Journal, are the subject of litigation between the adult son of Mr. Nye, who hopes to publish or sell them, and the KBI, which claims to own the material. Today, the KBI declines to explain the five-day delay in visiting the suspect's farmhouse or to answer other questions delivered via email as well as by hand to a receptionist at its Topeka headquarters.

Associated Press Duane West
says the delay is no mystery to him. Mr. West, 81 years old, is the prosecutor who ultimately won convictions and death sentences against the killers, Perry Smith
and Richard Hickock.
Mr. West says he remembers well the first time he heard the two suspects' names. It was in the county sheriff's office here, where investigators convened each morning to brainstorm under Mr. Dewey's leadership. On Dec. 5, 1959, when news came that an incarcerated former employee of the Clutter farm had fingered Mr. Hickock, Mr. Dewey delivered a line that his "In Cold Blood" character never spoke. "Dewey said it wasn't them," Mr. West recalls. "Dewey was convinced it was somebody local who had a grudge against Herb Clutter." Over the decades, literary sleuths have turned up numerous journalistic sins in "In Cold Blood," ranging from minor inaccuracies to outright fabrication. The latest revelations, though, are particularly damaging because they undermine one of the longest-standing defenses of the book: that the KBI hailed it as true. Mr. Dewey many times called the book accurate. Mr. Capote's defenders note that the rules of non-fiction-book writing, including the footnoting of source material, hardened only after Mr. Capote helped pioneer the genre. A similar defense can be made for the KBI, which in 1959 had no protocol for how to handle celebrity writers from New York promising not to publish a word until long after the case had been resolved—a vow Mr. Capote kept.

"In this day and age, we can't even recreate the proper context for these events," says Larry Welch,
a longtime KBI director who retired in 2007. "Alvin Dewey was a friend of mine," Mr. Welch says. "He was very professional in everything he did." In state court in Topeka, the Kansas attorney general has obtained a temporary restraining order against Ron Nye, the son of the late detective, and Gary McAvoy,
owner of Vintage Memorabilia in Seattle, prohibiting them from publishing or selling Clutter-related documents brought home years ago by the deceased KBI sleuth. The attorney general contends, among other things, that the documents belong to the state and that their dissemination would violate the privacy of surviving Clutter family members. Enlarge Image

Associated Press Messrs. Nye and McAvoy counter that the agency's primary purpose is to suppress unflattering truths about the agency. The KBI documents at issue "directly contradict portions of In Cold Blood," the men asserted in a Feb. 1 court filing. "Because of that disconnect," the filing says, "current KBI management—hoping to keep that material from the public—has embarked on an intimidation and suppression campaign." The surviving members of the Clutter family, breaking a 50-year policy of silence about the case, last year spoke out in opposition to the sale of crime-scene photographs of the murder and other KBI evidence. "I cannot describe for you the pain and anguish it would cause the family if these items were actually allowed to become public information," Topeka attorney Michael Clutter,
a relative of the murdered family, wrote in an Aug. 15 letter to Mr. McAvoy. To be sure, the KBI's hesitation in pursuing Messrs. Smith and Hickock was brief, resulting in no delay of justice. Within five months of killing the Clutters, Messrs. Smith and Hickock were caught, convicted and sentenced to death. Both men confessed. They were hanged in 1965. The agency's assistance to Mr. Capote contributed heavily to the success of a book that became an instant classic, earning its author millions of dollars and acclaim for having created what was hailed as a new literary genre, the nonfiction novel. The book also remains a point of pride at the KBI. Visitors to the agency's headquarters are shown a glass-encased copy of the book along with evidence such as the shotgun used to kill the victims. The agency has long played down its role in the creation of "In Cold Blood," saying Mr. Capote received no favors or access beyond that granted other journalists. "I never treated Truman any differently than I did any of the other news media," Mr. Dewey said before his death in 1987, in an interview with George Plimpton.
"As far as showing him any favoritism or giving him any information, absolutely not. He went out on his own and dug it up." A substantial body of evidence contradicts Mr. Dewey. In the Capote archives at the New York Public Library, handwritten letters from the author to Mr. Dewey—whom he often called "Foxy"—express gratitude for information and documents received from the agent, along with specific requests for more. "Alvin, something VERY important! Nancy's diary had entries for the last four years. I need the entries for Sat. Nov 14th in 1958, 1957, 1956. Urgent!" Mr. Capote wrote in a postcard to the Deweys on May 3, 1960. Two weeks later, a Capote letter to the Deweys begins, "Dearhearts…Bless you for sending the diary entries." The notes show that when Mr. Capote and his assistant, novelist Harper Lee,
traveled to Garden City in the winter of 1960, Mr. Dewey gave them exclusive access to the Clutter files for a week. Mr. Dewey also granted them private interviews with the arrested killers after he had told the media that no such interviews would be granted, according to Charles J. Shields,
who studied the Capote archives for his 2006 biography of Miss Lee, "Mockingbird." Through her attorney, Miss Lee declined to comment. In an interview shortly before his 2003 death, Mr. Nye, the former KBI detective, told Mr. Shields that he, too, granted special interviews to Miss Lee. In one of Mr. Nye's recently resurfaced notebooks is an inscription that says: "For Harold Nye, in affectionate admiration. Nelle Harper Lee. January 15, 1960." Mr. Nye also told Mr. Shields that Mr. Dewey gave Mr. Capote and Ms. Lee "a full set of the reports. That was like committing the largest sin there was," according to Mr. Shields' book. Despite researching and writing "In Cold Blood" for five years, Mr. Capote spent relatively little time in Kansas, relying on mail and telephone calls. His letters to the Deweys suggest that the author also relied on Mr. Dewey to persuade reluctant Garden Citians to talk. For instance when Mr. West, the prosecutor, proved uncooperative, Mr. Capote asked Mr. Dewey to coax the assistant prosecutor, Logan Green,
into talking. "Dear Foxy," began a 1960 Capote letter to Mr. Dewey, "Bless you for your help with Logan Green; the result was excellent." Also uninterested in talking was 17-year-old Bobby Rupp,
Nancy's boyfriend. As the last person to see the Clutters alive—he had visited Nancy at the Clutter home the night of the killings—Mr. Rupp became an early suspect. In a recent interview, Mr. Rupp, today a farmer outside Garden City, said he had no interest in talking with Mr. Capote or Ms. Lee. "I only did it because Al Dewey advised me to," he said. Enlarge Image
Mr. Capote's Kansas license
Gordon M. Grant for The Wall Street Journal Mr. Dewey helped obtain a Kansas driver's license for Mr. Capote, who had no Kansas address. According to a 1962 letter at the New York library, from Mr. Capote to the Deweys, the license gave the author's address as a Garden City post-office box belonging to the KBI agent. In search of the license, the Journal found that it now resides in the wallet of Joseph Petrocik,
a friend of the late author. "It's a treasured memento," says Mr. Petrocik. Only upon the recent death of a Hollywood memorabilia collector did it emerge that Mr. Capote required Columbia Pictures to offer Mr. Dewey's wife, Marie, a job as a consultant to the making of the 1967 film version of "In Cold Blood." The contract, which landed with Los Angeles dealer George Houle,
states that Columbia Pictures will "pay her as compensation for her services the sum of $10,000." Mrs. Dewey died in 2002. A person close to Columbia Pictures confirms that she was paid as a consultant to the film. In letters composed while writing "In Cold Blood," Mr. Capote expressly articulated his intention to make Mr. Dewey the hero of the book. By virtue of being stationed in Garden City, Mr. Dewey took charge of the other agents who came to town following the killings. Tall, dark and "JUST PLAIN HANDSOME"—as Harper Lee wrote in her notes—Mr. Dewey exuded a grim determination that helped reassure a community terrified by the massacre. As day after day after day passed without a break in the case, the laconic lawman endured a private agony apparent only to his wife, according to Mr. Capote's telling. Too haunted by the murders to eat much or sleep, he started smoking 60 cigarettes a day, his mind obsessed with theories about who might have bound, gagged and fired a shotgun to the heads of Herb and Bonnie Clutter
and their teenage son and daughter. Nineteen days passed before a prison inmate, Floyd Wells,
offered an answer. Mr. Wells, a former employee on the Clutter farm, came forward to announce that one of his former cellmates, Mr. Hickock, had told him he intended to rob and kill the Clutters with the help of Mr. Smith, another ex-convict. In Mr. Capote's telling, that very evening the KBI dispatched Mr. Nye to the farmhouse of Mr. Hickock's parents. Finding only the parents home, Mr. Nye sits down to coffee with them. Making no mention of murder, Mr. Nye pretends to be seeking Mr. Hickock only for parole violation and hot-check writing. That tactic induces Eunice and Walter Hickock inadvertently to disclose all manner of incriminating information about their son, including that he recently bought a 12-gauge shotgun, leaning right there against a wall—the same gauge used to kill the Clutters. "Nye shut his notebook and put his pen in his pocket, and both his hands as well, for his hands were shaking from excitement," Mr. Capote wrote. Within a few hours of receiving the Wells tip, in Mr. Capote's telling, the KBI had essentially confirmed it. But according to the KBI documents, this isn't how it happened. The documents show that the agency waited five full days after Mr. Wells' statement to visit the Hickock farm, the last known whereabouts of Richard Hickock. When the visit did occur, the documents show, it didn't involve a lone agent venturing in the dark of night to the farm, and being served coffee. The documents show that four lawmen—three KBI agents and a local sheriff's deputy—converged midday on the farm. They found only the suspect's mother at home. They made no pretense of pursuing a parole violation. Executing a search, they found the shotgun, took it outside and fired it to collect the empty casing for ballistic purposes. They also confiscated clothing that appeared to be smattered with blood. Shortly before his death, Mr. Nye penned an account of the investigation that supported Mr. Capote's telling. And conceivably, KBI documents not in the Nye cache could contradict those that are. But in both his official report on the investigation and his daily steno notebooks on the case, Mr. Nye cites his first visit to the Hickock farm as taking place on Dec. 9. Moreover, in contrast to Mr. Dewey, Mr. Nye many times called the book a work of fiction. "I was under the impression that the book was going to be factual, and it was not; it was a fiction book," Mr. Nye said in Mr. Plimpton's 1997 book, "Truman Capote." The KBI documents appear to support what Mr. West, the former prosecutor, has been saying for years: that the KBI didn't act immediately on the Wells tip because Mr. Dewey didn't believe it. "Alvin Dewey pooh-poohed the Wells tip," says Mr. West. "He said Wells was a no-good criminal who had made the whole thing up." Mr. West, a longtime critic of "In Cold Blood," personifies something that Mr. Dewey said shortly before his death. In an interview with the Garden City Telegram, Mr. Dewey said that the treatment people received in Mr. Capote's book depended on whether he liked them. "I was the luckiest," Mr. Dewey said. Mr. West, not so much. An unapologetic booster of Garden City—he went on to become its mayor and compose a musical about one of its founders, Buffalo Jones—Mr. West says he found distasteful the awe that the arrival of a famous writer inspired in townspeople, particularly the Deweys. As lead prosecutor, Mr. West says he treated Mr. Capote as no more important than any other journalist. Mr. Capote, meanwhile, expressed contempt for Mr. West in notes and letters written at the time and now at the New York library. In the book, Mr. Capote mischaracterized Mr. West as an underling to Logan Green, the assistant prosecutor who cooperated with the author. Mr. Capote described Mr. West as a "portly young man of twenty-eight who looks forty and sometimes fifty." Although the recently surfaced KBI documents support Mr. West's argument that "In Cold Blood" exaggerates the role of the KBI, he nevertheless supports the agency's legal battle to keep the documents from being sold or published. "The victims in the case are the Clutters," he says. "It's time to let them rest in peace." Corrections & Amplifications The night of the Clutter-family killings in 1959, Nancy Clutter and her boyfriend watched television at the Clutter home. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that Nancy and her boyfriend went out on a date that night. —Sara Germano in New York contributed to this article.

Gupta Challenges U.S. Wiretaps in Appeal
Former Goldman Sachs Director Says Rajaratnam Phone Records Shouldn't Have Been Used in His Insider-Trading Trial
By
Chad Bray
Updated May 21, 2013 6:03 p.m. ET
Rajat Gupta was convicted on insider-trading charges in part due to phone records that showed he finished a conference call with the board of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and called a friend who was a hedge-fund manager, who moments later placed a profitable trade on Goldman stock. His lawyer argued Tuesday it was merely a coincidence. Mr. Gupta, in a bid to stay out of prison, is trying to convince a federal appeals court to set...

Cole Hamels
Associated Press In baseball, weird statistical quirks have a way of evening themselves out over the course of a season. But until that happens, there's plenty of fun to be had gawking at them and marveling at the good fortune—or in the case of Philadelphia Phillies starter Cole Hamels, the distinct misfortune—they can bring. Hamels, the 2008 World Series MVP, hasn't thrown a pitch with his team leading the game since April 7. On Monday, in a 5-1 loss to the Marlins, the Phillies wasted a 10-strikeout, zero-walk outing by Hamels, whose streak of pitching without a lead has now reached 52.2 innings, the 10th longest since 2000. But while most of the pitchers ahead of him on the list were at least partly to blame (seven had ERAs over 5.00) Hamels has pretty much been the same All Star pitcher he was in 2012. Over his last eight starts (52 innings), he's compiled a 3.12 ERA—which isn't far from last year's 3.05 ERA, which was good enough for a 17-6 record and eighth place in Cy Young Award voting. Enlarge Image
Against Miami Monday, Hamels pitched six innings, allowing only two earned runs, but lost anyhow. It was the fifth time during Hamels's streak that the Phillies have scored one run or less. In the 31 Phillies games started by someone other than Hamels during this span, they've only scored one run or less four times. One ray of hope: On Sunday, Hamels (1-7) is scheduled to take the mound against the Nationals, a team he's beaten the most (13 times) in his eight-year career. —Michael Salfino

Ten months after an Afghan-born surgeon named Aria Sabit arrived in Ventura, Calif., local hospital staffers noticed he suddenly developed a preference for an obscure brand of spinal implants for many of his surgeries. Soon his volume of operations increased, with sometimes-tragic results. By the time he moved on less than a year later in late 2010, he had become embroiled in investigations by the California medical board and the...

HTC Warns That Revenue and Margins Will Decline
By
Lorraine Luk And Aries Poon Updated Feb. 4, 2013 6:17 a.m. ET
TAIPEI—Smartphone maker HTC Corp. said first-quarter revenue and profit margins would fall, as it battles competition from Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and makers of low-cost phones. HTC said Monday that it hoped that revenue would get boosts starting in the second quarter from a new flagship phone and continued growth in emerging markets. Analysts were skeptical about the company's outlook, however. The Taiwanese...
