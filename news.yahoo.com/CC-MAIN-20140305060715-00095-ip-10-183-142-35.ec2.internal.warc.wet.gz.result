Salmonella Outbreak Blamed for 16 Illnesses in 5 States

At least 16 people in five different states have fallen ill with salmonella. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told the Associated Press and other media outlets on Monday that the salmonella has been linked to ground beef sold by two different Michigan businesses.The businesses in question, Gab Halal Foods and Jouni Meats, are both located in the Metro Detroit area. Both businesses issued recalls for a combined total of more than 1,000 pounds of ground beef late last week.Here is some of the key information that has emerged about the salmonella outbreak as of Monday.* Gab Halal Foods, which is located in Troy, Mich., issued a recall for "approximately 550 pounds" of ground beef that had been sold through its facility. The beef in question had been produced between Dec. 4 and Dec. 10 of last year.* Jouni Meats, which is located in Sterling Heights, Mich., had actually issued its recall first, for 500 pounds of ground beef that had been produced at its facility between Dec. 4 and Dec. 9 of last year.* The majority of salmonella cases have been reported in Michigan, with at least seven cases stemming from the exact same restaurant, where patrons had reportedly consumed raw kibbeh.* According to reports by Reuters and other media outlets on Monday, nine of the 16 people that have fallen ill with salmonella are from Michigan, while an additional three cases have been identified in Wisconsin, two in Illinois, and one each in Arizona and Iowa.* No deaths have been reported so far, but at least half of those that have fallen ill with the strain of salmonella linked to the two Michigan businesses have had to be hospitalized.* Jouni Meats and Gab Halal Foods are individually owned by a pair of brothers. The owner of Jouni Meats, Khalil Jouni, told Reuters on Monday that he believed that the meat may have been tainted elsewhere, as his facility distributed beef to many other local businesses without any report of further illnesses.* As the Detroit Free Press noted on Monday, salmonella can affect people of all ages. Those affected so far range in age from 2 to 87 years of age. Young children and seniors are likely to be hit harder by the disease than others.* Various media outlets have noted that this particular strain of salmonella, known as salmonella Typhimurium, is fairly rare in and of itself. More specifically, according to a report by NBC News, the "genetic fingerprint" of this strain has been "rarely seen previously."* A person who becomes ill with salmonella typically suffers from abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever, all of which manifest themselves within 12-72 hours "after infection," as noted by the Detroit Free Press.Vanessa Evans is a musician and freelance writer based in Michigan, with a lifelong interest in health and nutrition issues.Healthsalmonella

US construction spending down 2.1 percent

WASHINGTON (AP) — Spending on U.S. construction projects fell in January by the largest amount in 18 months as home construction stalled and spending on government projects fell to the lowest level in more than six years.The dip was viewed as a temporary setback with construction expected to keep moving higher this year.Construction spending fell 2.1 percent in January compared with December, when spending had risen 1.1 percent. It was the biggest one-month decline since July 2011, the Commerce Department said Friday.Residential construction, which has been leading the rebound in building, stalled in January with no gain in activity following a 1.7 percent rise in December.Non-residential building dropped 5.1 percent while public construction was down 1 percent, pushing activity in the government sector to the lowest point since November 2006.For all of last year, construction spending totaled $855.4 billion, an increase of 9.9 percent from 2011. It was the first annual gain after five straight years of decline. But construction still well below healthy levels.

Construction activity in 2012 is 26.7 percent below the all-time high of $1.17 trillion set in 2007 at the peak of the housing boom.The housing market began recovering last year after a deep, six-year slump. Steady hiring and nearly record-low mortgage rates have encouraged more Americans to buy homes. More people are also moving out on their own after living with friends and relatives in the recession. That's driving a big gain in apartment construction and also pushing up rents.Sales of previously occupied homes ticked up in January after rising to their highest level in five years in 2012. And new home sales jumped 16 percent last month from December to the highest level since July 2008 while home prices rose by the most in more than six years in the 12 months ending in December.Rising home prices encourage more people to buy before prices rise further.Builders, meanwhile, started work on the most new homes in 4 1/2 years in December. Last year was the best year for residential construction since 2008, just after the recession started.Politics & GovernmentReal Estate
