Demi Moore
Demi Moore is admired not only for her strong acting skills but also for her looks. She's always been a raven-haired beauty with distinctive facial features and a toned, shapely figure.These days, however, the "Margin Call" actress looks painfully thin. Everyone knows by now that the 49-year-old star split with her 33-year-old husband Ashton Kutcher. The stress from the divorce has likely taken its toll. So if the woman who will appear in "Linda LoveLace" as Gloria Steinem isn't eating much these days, we understand it.But is it more than that? Demi was recently hospitalized for what her reps are calling "exhaustion." "Because of the stresses in her life right now, Demi has chosen to seek professional assistance to treat her exhaustion and improve her overall health. She looks forward to getting well and is grateful for the support of her family and friends," said her rep.However, TMZ claims the actress is being treated for substance abuse.Is it one, or the other, or both?As reported at HelpGuide.org, sudden weight loss or weight gain can be attributed to substance abuse. It would not be a stretch to learn that the mother of three is abusing drugs, due to everything that's going on in her life.Not only has Ms. Moore lost her husband, she's also dealing with being an "over-the-hill" actress. As reported at BBC News, "Hollywood is littered with tales of aging starlets who see their careers take a nosedive after they pass the big 4-0."Says James Parish, a Hollywood historian and author of Katherine Hepburn: The UnTold Story, on 53-year-old Michelle Pfeiffer, "She does very few films - not because she's not talented, not because she's not pretty in a mature way, but just because there aren't many parts for women over 40."Although a good actress like Demi will likely continue to get roles, even if they are centered on non box-office bonanzas, such as "Another Happy Day" with Ellen Barkin, she can also make a name for herself as a director. She recently helped direct the Lifetime Network's "Five," a movie that showcases five stories about breast cancer. The film was co-directed with Jennifer Aniston, Alicia Keys, Patty Jenkins and Penelope Spheeris.Meanwhile, her fans root for her recovery so that she can get back on her feet and move on with her life, whether in acting, directing or both.

Ex-Penn State assistant wants firing decision date

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A former Penn State assistant football coach who was a key witness in the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse case is disputing the university's assertion that he was fired as part of a routine changing of the guard under a new head football coach.Former assistant coach Mike McQueary has filed a whistleblower and defamation lawsuit against Penn State alleging that statements made in 2011 by then-university president Graham Spanier after charges were filed in the Sandusky case made McQueary look untruthful. The university tried unsuccessfully last month to have the lawsuit thrown out, but a judge ruled that the allegations of "outrageous conduct" on the part of the school are sufficient to keep it alive.The university has maintained that new head coach Bill O'Brien simply didn't rehire McQueary after his contract expired at the end of June 2012, and it was no different from the turnover of scores of college assistants every year, The (Harrisburg) Patriot-News (http://bit.ly/ZksKX2) reported.But a response by McQueary filed Friday in Centre County court said he had been employed since 2004 "with no specified ending date," and even if the contract ended last year, "strict proof" is required of when the decision to terminate him was made.McQueary testified last summer during Sandusky's three-week criminal trial, which resulted in a 45-count guilty verdict. Sandusky, 69, is serving a 30- to 60-year sentence but is appealing and maintains his innocence. McQueary's suit argues that he was eventually fired because of his role in the case. He is seeking millions of dollars in damages.Sandusky was first charged with child sexual abuse in November 2011. At the same time, athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz, administrators who worked under Spanier, were accused of perjury and failure to properly report suspected abuse. Additional charges were added last year against Curley and Schultz, and Spanier was also charged in the alleged cover-up of Sandusky complaints. All three dispute the allegations.Spanier, forced out as president shortly after he issued a news release in support of Curley and Schultz, remains a tenured faculty member and is on paid leave. Curley has been on leave to complete the last year of his contract as athletic director. Schultz has retired.___Information from: The Patriot-News, http://www.pennlive.com/patriotnewsCrime & JusticeSociety & CultureJerry SanduskyMike McQuearyGraham Spanier
