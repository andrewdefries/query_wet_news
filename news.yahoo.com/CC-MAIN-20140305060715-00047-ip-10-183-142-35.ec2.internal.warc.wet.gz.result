The New Orleans Saints lost cornerback Tracy Porter in free agency but they’ve ensured their other top starter will not be going anywhere.
Jabari Greer, who had one year remaining on his existing deal, has agreed to an extension worth $23 million, according to James Varney of the New Orleans Times-Picayune.
Greer has been with the Saints for three seasons and has probably been the best and most consistent performer in the secondary. Locking him up ensures some continuity with Patrick Robinson, the former first-round draft pick, expected to step in as a replacement for Porter. That means Johnny Patrick will become the top backup.
Now, if the Saints and general manager Mickey Loomis could just find a way to sign quarterback Drew Brees, they would really be on a roll. Perhaps that news will be delayed until news finally comes of discipline for players involved in the bounty scandal. That news could come next week.
