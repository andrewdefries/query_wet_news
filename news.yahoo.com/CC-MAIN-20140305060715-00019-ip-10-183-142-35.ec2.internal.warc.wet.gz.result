Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas and Guanabara Bay will be the site of water sport events during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. Although Rio's Olympic bid included the promise to clean up the filthy waters, industrial and human pollution still remain a major problem. According to the Deputy State Secretary of Environment just 34% of Rio's sewage is treated while the remainder flows untreated into the waters.
