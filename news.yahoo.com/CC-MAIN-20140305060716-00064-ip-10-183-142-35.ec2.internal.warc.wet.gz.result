Kenyans are waiting in long lines to cast their ballots five years after more than 1,000 people died in election-related violence. Multiple attacks against security forces in Kenya on Monday killed at least 19 people. The country's top two presidential candidates condemned the attacks. Prime Minister Raila Odinga called it a "heinous act of aggression" during a historic exercise. Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta said he was discouraged by the news but he was sure the security situation would be brought under control.Here is a collection of images from AP's team of photographers covering this tense day of voting in Kenya.___Follow AP photographers on Twitter: http://apne.ws/XEJ4O2Politics & GovernmentUnrest, Conflicts & WarKenya

Descriptive Camera Trades Pictures for Text

The Descriptive Camera is a novel idea. It’s the kind of idea someone who’s looking for new ways to approach photography comes up with, when, as a society, we’re oversaturated with digital cameras, Facebook and Instagram.
Instead of revealing a picture, the camera prints a description of what’s in the image. And the description isn’t written by Watson or a carefully written algorithm, it’s actually crowd sourced. The camera hooks up to a wired internet line, and after you take the picture it’s sent to a webpage. There a “describer” views the image, types whatever he or she sees, and hits “submit.” A printer built into the camera then reveals the description. It can be literal or humorous; it can be a short 140 characters or the truly necessary 1,000 words.
The camera is homemade and built with off-the-shelf technology by Matt Richardson, a student and, fittingly, an editor at MAKE Magazine. The camera clearly didn’t roll off the Apple manufacturing line next to its sleek chrome and glass devices, but that’s part of what of what makes it interesting. It’s not a re-imagined smartphone or tablet; it’s something new and funky.
Does it have any practical applications at the moment? No. But it’s not as if Mr. Richardson doesn’t know that. He sees the Descriptive Camera as a first step and an opportunity to talk about photography in creative and new ways.

Calif. seeks record fine in pipeline explosion

California regulators on Tuesday July 16, 2013 called on Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay at least $300 million in fines in connection with a deadly 2010 gas pipeline blast in what they said would amount to the largest fine ever levied by the state Public Utilities Commission.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California regulators on Tuesday called on Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay at least $300 million in fines in connection with a deadly 2010 gas pipeline blast in what they said would amount to the largest fine ever levied by the state Public Utilities Commission.In an amended brief filed in the pipeline case, the commission's safety division cited the eight people killed and 38 homes destroyed in the blast in the San Francisco Bay Area suburb of San Bruno and said there were steps PG&E could have taken to prevent the explosion."The tragedy in San Bruno, which was directly caused by PG&E's unreasonable conduct and neglect for decades, was the worst disaster in the history of California electric and/or gas utilities," the safety division said in its filing.Regulators had originally called for a $2.25 billion penalty against PG&E, though it would consist entirely of funds the utility has spent or promised to spend on pipeline system improvements ordered by the commission.Consumer advocates and San Bruno officials had objected to that penalty. San Bruno officials said it was tax deductible and "littered" with credits and perks to benefit PG&E that would amount to a net penalty of almost nothing to the company.The lead PUC attorneys probing the blast abruptly quit the investigation after the penalty was announced, with one, Robert Cagan, calling it "unlawful" in an e-mail sent to radio station KQED.Under the amended brief, $300 million of the $2.25 billion would go into the state's general fund in the form of a fine. Additionally, PG&E shareholders, not ratepayers, would be on the hook for a significant share of the costs to fix the pipeline system, said Tom Long, the legal director of The Utility Reform Network, a utility watchdog group."What the safety division announced today is finally a real penalty," Long said. "It will actually require PG&E shareholders to pay real money."Tom Bottorff, PG&E's senior vice president for regulatory affairs, characterized the revised penalty as overly punitive and said it would backfire by making it difficult for the utility to raise "the capital necessary to maintain the extraordinary investment in safety currently under way, or raise billions of dollars more for safety improvements mandated by the CPUC.""In its zeal to punish PG&E, the staff of the California Public Utilities Commission has lost sight of our important shared goal of making PG&E's natural gas operation the safest in the country as quickly as we possibly can," Bottorff said in a statement.The National Transportation Safety Board unanimously agreed in 2011 that the blast was caused by what board chairman Deborah Hersman called a "litany of failures" by PG&E, as well as weak oversight by regulators.Separate from the NTSB investigation, investigators at the utilities commission blamed PG&E for the explosion, which occurred when an underground pipeline ruptured at the site of a decades-old faulty weld, sparking a massive fire.PG&E has accepted liability for the disaster in numerous public statements but has denied most of state investigators' allegations that the utility violated safety rules.The penalty recommended Tuesday still must be reviewed by an administrative law judge and the five-member commission itself, both of which can offer amendments or counter-proposals before a final vote.Disasters & AccidentsSociety & CulturePublic Utilities Commission

Clinton soars, Palin plummets in most-admired survey

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sets a record in Gallup’s annual most-admired survey, while Sarah Palin falls farther off the popularity radar.
View photo.800px-Defense.gov_News_Photo_100406-D-7203C-002Gallup has run its most-admired man and woman survey since World War II, and in the 2012 edition, Clinton and President Barack Obama kept their top positions among those asked a simple question: “What man that you have heard or read about, living today in any part of the world, do you admire most? And who is your second choice?”
Link: Read the survey
Clinton was named as most-admired woman for the 17th time since she became a national figure in 1992. Eleanor Roosevelt held the previous record when she was named 13 times as the most-admired woman.
The only two women to finish ahead of Clinton in that 20-year period were Mother Teresa (twice) and Laura Bush (once).
Obama was named most-admired man for the fifth time. President Dwight Eisenhower was named 12 times in the survey as most admired.
Palin came within one percentage point of matching Hillary Clinton in 2009, when she had 15 percent of the polling, compared with 16 percent for Clinton.
In 2012, Palin had just 2 percent of the polling, finishing in a fifth-place tie. Clinton had 21 percent, followed by First Lady Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and Condoleezza Rice.
President Barack Obama had 30 percent of the polling for men, followed by Nelson Mandela, Mitt Romney, the Reverend Billy Graham, George W. Bush, and Pope Benedict XVI.
The pollsters at Gallup say it’s not unusual for the current president to be named as most-admired man. But in the past, Pope John Paul II, Henry Kissinger, and then-former president Eisenhower were picked over sitting presidents.
With the exception of Mother Teresa, the eight most popular women in the poll since 1946 have had political connections. Margaret Thatcher and Jacqueline Kennedy won a combined 11 times.
The Reverend Billy Graham has appeared in the top 10 list a staggering 56 times, with Ronald Reagan second with 31 appearances. Queen Elizabeth II has been in the top 10 list 46 times. However, neither Graham nor the queen were ever named first in the poll.
Among the names from the 2011 top 10 list that didn’t make it in the following year are Angeline Jolie, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Bill Gates, Laura Bush, Ellen DeGeneres, and Michele Bachmann.

Debt and spending deal picks up momentum in Senate

WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House and congressional leaders worked Monday to align lawmakers from both parties behind their formula for averting a financial meltdown and halting the government's prolific spending habits. Despite resistance from both liberals and conservatives, momentum appeared to be building in support of the compromise deficit-reduction plan.In an apparent show of confidence, leaders in the House said they planned to bring the plan to the floor for a vote Monday afternoon. Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier, R-Calif., said there would be an hour of debate before moving to a vote.In the Senate, where one senator can hold up action, Majority Leader Harry Reid said he was hoping to get agreement to allow a vote Monday evening. "We need to send this to President Obama as soon as we can."A member of the Republican leadership in the Senate predicted at least 30 GOP votes. "Maybe 35 will support it in the end. There will be some who will pull back," Sen. Mike Crapo, the deputy Republican whip, told reporters, as climactic votes approached in both the House and Senate on the long-sought spending plan.Leaders in both chambers were meeting with their rank-and-file to promote the package, and President Barack Obama sent out a video message to sell Democrats on the plan. "This has been a long and messy process," he said. "As with any compromise, the outcome is far from satisfying."Obama was also doing debt-related tweeting. "The debt agreement makes a significant down payment to reduce the deficit — finding savings in both defense and domestic spending," he said in one."We'll know over the next two to three hours," said House freshman Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., when asked if House Speaker John Boehner had the votes in the House, where conservatives have been more resistant to the compromise.Reid opened the day's session in the Senate by declaring the deal shows that the often-dysfunctional Senate can come together when it counts. "People on the right are upset, people on the left are upset, people in the middle are upset," he said. "It was a compromise."Crapo's assessment came as Vice President Joe Biden, who played an instrumental role in successful weekend efforts to hammer out an accord, went to Capitol Hill to sell the plan in separate meetings with House and Senate Democrats.Relief around the world was indisputable, with Asian shares on Monday enjoying one of the best sessions in weeks. The advance continued in Europe. Wall Street opened higher, but faltered on a report that a key manufacturing index had dropped sharply in July.Whatever momentum could be claimed for the deficit-reduction plan, Congress still has precious little time to avert a potentially devastating default on U.S. obligations. And there was little dispute that the endgame product contained plenty to offend lawmakers of both parties, and tea party sympathizers as well.Sen. John McCain conceded as much, saying he'd have to "swallow hard" to vote for it because of cuts in defense spending. But the Arizona Republican said lawmakers had little choice in the face of the specter of default.Fellow Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he was a no vote. "Simply stated, it locks us into more debt, bigger government and most devastating of all, a weakened defense infrastructure at a time when we face growing threats."Another House Republican, Michael Turner of Ohio said he was not ready to endorse the package as he left a closed-door meeting of House GOP lawmakers. Turner is a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and potential cuts to defense spending could be an issue among some Republicans.Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said she was undecided because of concerns about cuts to rural hospitals and home health care as well as defense. "I want to avoid the kind of hollowed-out military we saw after Vietnam," she said.The compromise plan agreed to late Sunday would mix a record increase in the government's borrowing cap with the promise of more than $2 trillion in spending cuts.Democratic votes are certain to be needed to pass the measure in the Republican-dominated House, just as Republicans will be needed to clear the measure through the Democratic Senate. Liberal Democrats were already complaining that Obama had given away too much to GOP leaders.Rep. Elliot Engel, a liberal Democrat from New York, said he was leaning no because the plan could lead to cuts to Medicare and other benefit programs. Boehner should get the votes from his majority Republicans, Engel said. "I don't think we're under any obligation to support this package.""Now, is this the deal I would have preferred? No," Obama said. "But this compromise does make a serious down payment on the deficit reduction we need, and gives each party a strong incentive to get a balanced plan done before the end of the year."The legislation would slice more than $2 trillion from federal spending over a decade and permit the nation's $14.3 trillion borrowing cap to rise by up to $2.4 trillion, enough to keep the government afloat through the 2012 elections — a key objective for Obama, whose poll numbers have sagged as the summertime crisis dragged on.John Boehner, R-Ohio, telephoned Obama at mid-evening to say the agreement had been struck, then immediately began pitching the deal to his fractious rank and file."It isn't the greatest deal in the world, but it shows how much we've changed the terms of the debate in this town," he said on a conference call, according to GOP officials. He added the agreement was "all spending cuts. The White House bid to raise taxes has been shut down."House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was publicly noncommittal. "I look forward to reviewing the legislation with my caucus to see what level of support we can provide," Pelosi said in a written statement. But Democratic officials said she was unlikely to do anything to try to scuttle the package."This deal trades people's livelihoods for the votes of a few unappeasable right-wing radicals, and I will not support it," said Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz.Tea party favorite and presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., countered that the deal "spends too much and doesn't cut enough. ... Someone has to say no. I will."The government presently borrows more than 40 cents of every dollar it spends, and without an infusion of borrowing authority, the government would face an unprecedented default on U.S. loans and obligations — like $23 billion worth of Social Security pension payments to retirees due Aug. 3.The increased borrowing authority includes $400 billion that would take effect immediately and $500 billion that Obama could order unless specifically denied by Congress. That $900 billion increase in the debt cap would be matched by savings produced over the coming decade by capping spending on day-to-day agency budgets passed by Congress each year.A special bipartisan committee would be established to find up to $1.5 trillion in deficit cuts, probably taken from benefit programs like farm subsidies, Medicare and the Medicaid health care program for the poor and disabled. Republicans dismissed the idea that the panel would approve tax increases.Any agreement by the panel would be voted on by both House and Senate — and if the panel deadlocked, automatic spending cuts would slash across much of the federal budget. Social Security, Medicaid and food stamps would be exempt from the automatic cuts, but payments to doctors, nursing homes and other Medicare providers could be trimmed, as could subsidies to insurance companies that offer an alternative to government-run Medicare.Top Obama aide Plouffe said in a morning network television interview that the administration wasn't giving up on pushing for new tax revenues down the road."The only way to really reduce the deficits significantly in a smart way is to make sure there is smart entitlement reform and closing of loopholes and tax reform," he said.But Republicans set the parameters of the debate, with Boehner successfully winning spending cuts equaling the amount of the debt increase — though the cuts phase in over time and future Congresses will have ample temptation to find ways around stringent spending caps called for in the pact.Obama said such appropriated accounts would be left with the lowest levels of spending as a percentage of the overall economy in more than a half-century.In the end, the deal was a split-the-differences compromise, with plenty for both sides to dislike. House GOP defense hawks came out on the losing end. So too did Democratic liberals seeking tax increases.Plouffe was interviewed on ABC's "Good Morning America," CBS's "The Early Show" and NBC's "Today" show. McCain appeared on CBS.David DreierSen.

WASHINGTON (AP) — With disgruntled passengers complaining about airline flight delays, Republican lawmakers and the airline industry pounced on the Obama administration. The glitch was invented by the White House for political reasons, they charged, and officials waited until the last minute to warn Congress and the airlines of the impending upheaval.They were wrong on the first count, and partly right on the second.The FAA has no choice but to cut $637 million as its share of $85 billion in automatic, government-wide spending cuts that must be achieved by the end of the federal budget year on Sept. 30.The cuts are required under a law enacted two years ago as the government was approaching its debt limit. Democrats were in favor of raising the debt limit without strings attached so as not to provoke an economic crisis, but Republicans insisted on substantial cuts in exchange. The compromise was to require that every government "program, project and activity" — with some exceptions, like Medicare — be cut equally."It was intentionally designed to provide no discretion whatsoever," said Stan Collender, a former House and Senate budget committee staffer, and author of "The Guide to the Federal Budget."At the time, it was thought the prospects of the cuts would be so dreadful that it would force both sides to negotiate a more sensible plan to resolve the government's budget woes. But that didn't happen, and the first of the cuts kicked in on March 1.As a result, the FAA has reduced the work schedules of nearly all of its 47,000 employees by one day every two weeks, including 15,000 air traffic controllers, as well as thousands of air traffic supervisors, managers and technicians who keep airport towers and radar facility equipment working. That's a 10 percent cut in hours and pay.Late Thursday, the Senate voted to allow the FAA to shift money among budget accounts to avoid controller furloughs. Approval still is needed in the House, which could vote as early as Friday.Republicans and the airline industry insist the FAA could find other places to cut in its nearly $16 billion annual budget. Two airline trade associations have filed a lawsuit trying to halt the furloughs."They (the White House) want to cause the most pain to the American people out there so they will put pressure on Congress to back away from sequestration (spending cuts)," said Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. "This should be laid right at the president's feet."But the budget law doesn't allow steeper cuts in one program in order to offset cuts in another. Air traffic control is part of the FAA's "operations" account, 70 percent of which goes toward employee salaries. The FAA plans to cut $485 million from operations, about $220 million of which will come from furloughs, said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta.Shuster points to contracts, consultants and travel as other expenditures that could be cut instead. But that's not as simple as it may sound.Travel already has been reduced, mainly to trips to keep the air traffic system functioning, like sending a technician to a facility to resolve an equipment problem, Huerta said. Overtime is being preserved for emergencies.The largest of the agency's operations contracts is to provide and maintain a communications system for air traffic operations. The second largest contract is for provision of weather, information on flight restrictions and other services to pilots. And the third largest pays companies to provide controllers for towers at small airports. The FAA's proposal to save money by shutting down 149 of the towers already has drawn complaints from lawmakers in both parties who don't want airports in their states and districts to lose towers."I would have to take the administration's position on this," said Bill Hoagland, a former Republican Senate Budget Committee aide who helped write a 1985 budget law that was the model for the current budget-cutting law. "They are administering the law as written."The budget law is specifically worded so that cuts are spread evenly across programs, making it difficult for the FAA to use money for contracts, for example, to make up for payroll cuts even through both are in the same budget "account," he said.At a news conference Thursday, congressional Republicans said if the FAA had to furlough controllers, it should have furloughed more of them in places like Waterloo, Iowa, instead of at big hub airports.The FAA decided against doing that because it would mean picking winners and losers among airlines and regions of the country, Huerta said. Also, the air traffic system is by nature interconnected — small airports are needed to feed passengers to the bigger hubs, he said.Lawmakers also have complained that the FAA didn't warn them air traffic disruptions were coming."How come you didn't tell us about this beforehand, the sequester, impact on the layoffs, the furloughs? Not a word. Not a breath," House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., angrily demanded of Huerta at a hearing this week.Airline and airport officials say they didn't receive specific information from the FAA about how the furloughs might affect air travel until a meeting called by the agency on April 16, six days before the furloughs took effect. Airport officials said they weren't invited and had to push the FAA to allow them to come to the meeting.In fact, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and FAA officials have been warning Congress and airlines since February that the furloughs were coming and that they could cause major delays. LaHood even held a news conference at the White House. Administration officials also discussed the impending furloughs at congressional hearings in March and earlier this month.But lawmakers and industry officials also have a point. In none of those hearings did FAA or Transportation Department officials go out of their way to disclose to Congress the extent of the anticipated flight delay mess, even though they had that information in hand at three hearings last week. Nor did they solicit help from Congress to avoid the furloughs. Rather, officials emphasized that safety would be maintained."We offered our apologies to them for the fact that we had not kept them informed about all of the things that we had been discussing," LaHood told reporters after a meeting Wednesday with Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., the senior Republican member of the committee, to discuss possible legislation to resolve the situation.___Follow Joan Lowy on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/AP_Joan_LowyEDITOR'S NOTE _ An occasional look at claims by political figures and how well they adhere to the facts.Politics & GovernmentGovernmentCongress

VALLEY FORGE, Pa. (AP) — Prescription drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp. said Thursday its net income increased 11 percent in its fiscal fourth quarter on greater sales of lower-cost, higher-profit generic drugs, as well as a boost from recent acquisitions.The company also raised its quarterly dividend 62 percent to 21 cents, and plans to buy back $750 million more in company stock on top of $97 million left in a previous stock buyback program.AmerisourceBergen's July-September revenue dropped 4 percent, but its profit rose because generic drug sales are more profitable than sales of brand-name drugs. Revenue from the company's generic division fell and specialty drug revenue increased. Specialty drugs are medications that require special handling, such as IVs or infusions.The company said its net income rose to $163.5 million, or 66 cents per share, from $147.3 million, or 54 cents per share. Revenue fell 4 percent, to $19.45 billion from $20.35 billion, helped by $335 million from acquisitions during the year.Analysts were more optimistic. They expected profit of 68 cents per share and $20.24 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.In fiscal 2012, AmerisourceBergen said its net income rose 2 percent, to $719 million, or $2.80 per share, from $706.6 million, or $2.54 per share. Revenue fell less than 1 percent, to $79.49 billion from $80 billion.The company said it expects to earn between $3.06 and $3.16 per share from continuing operations this year. AmerisourceBergen is pursuing the sale of its contract pharmaceutical packaging business, AndersonBrecon, which added 4 cents per share profit in 2012.Revenue is expected to grow 6 to 9 percent, or about $84.26 billion to $86.64 billion.Analysts are forecasting net income of $3.13 per share and $84.88 billion in revenue.AmerisourceBergen shares rose 78 cents, or 2 percent, to $40.22 in morning trading.Investment & Company InformationFinance

Indian publisher withdraws book on Hindus after court case

By Sruthi Gottipati NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Penguin Books India has agreed to withdraw from sale all copies of a book that takes an unorthodox view of Hinduism, and will pulp them as part of a settlement after a case was filed against the publisher, the petitioners' lawyer said. "The Hindus: An Alternative History" by Wendy Doniger, a professor at the University of Chicago's Divinity School, was published in India in 2011. Its depiction of the religion drew criticism from both conservative Hindus and some scholars. Penguin on Monday agreed in the Saket Court in Delhi to recall the book, the petitioners' lawyer Monika Arora said. What appeared to be a copy of the court agreement was widely circulated on the internet on Tuesday. A complaint was filed by seven petitioners' in the court in 2011. Penguin did not respond to several requests for comment. The lead petitioner's original complaint criticized the book for "heresies and factual inaccuracies" and criticized Doniger for having a selective approach to writing about Hinduism. "She denounced the Hindu Gods and freedom fighters of India," the petitioners' lawyer Arora told Reuters. A group headed by the lead petitioner has previously made complaints about diverse subjects including sex education in schools and a magazine article about Hindu militancy. The book's withdrawal triggered anger on Twitter, rekindling a debate on freedom of speech in the world's largest democracy. "The 'offended' prevail over freedom of speech. Surely gods too great to be so easily upset?" tweeted Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. It was not the first time a book has been banned in India. Rushdie's 1988 novel "The Satanic Verses", which many Muslims deemed blasphemous, is proscribed due to its depiction of Islam. The legal notice said Doniger was incorrect in describing the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), India's largest Hindu nationalist organization, which is close to the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as the party's militant wing. The BJP is the frontrunner in national polls due by May. The notice also said that Doniger incorrectly tells readers the RSS was behind the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, India's freedom hero, saying a judicial commission had exonerated the RSS of any complicity in Gandhi's murder. Gandhi was shot dead by a former member of the organization. In a separate incident last week, Hindu hardliners burned copies of an Indian magazine because of a story in which it quotes a Hindu nationalist leader as saying that Mohan Bhagwat, who leads the RSS, had sanctioned deadly attacks on Muslims. The RSS has denied the allegations against Bhagwat. (Reporting By Sruthi Gottipati; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Alistair Lyon)Religion & BeliefsBooks & PublishingPenguin Books IndiaWendy Doniger

WINDSOR, England (AP) — The "Sculling Sloth" is getting even slower.Hamadou Djibo Issaka, the Niger rower at the London Olympics despite only three months of experience in the sport, competed again Tuesday at Dorney Lake.He crossed the finish line with his boat almost at a standstill.Djibo Issaka captivated the crowds over the weekend with show-stopping turns in the heats and the repechage of the single sculls, when he finished out of breath — and nearly two minutes behind the winners.Complete with the warmest of smiles and extraordinary spirit, Djibo Issaka pushed his body to the limit in a lower qualification race this time. His mark of 9 minutes, 7.99 seconds for the 2,000-meter course was the slowest of his three races at the regatta by 28 seconds.Wearing a yellow T-shirt underneath his orange-and-green Niger jersey, he was given a rousing reception as he passed the main grandstands 300 meters from the line."Give him a big cheer for plowing on," the announcer said.

Niger's Hamadou Djibo Issaka rests after a men's rowing single sculls semifinal in Eton Dorney, near …
Like on Sunday, he bent over as soon as he crossed the line, taking deep breaths."I am very happy because this is my first time at an Olympics," the 35-year-old Djibo Issaka said. "It's not easy for me to be here. I don't have any technique. I've been learning only three months. But with the time and the years, I'll get the technique."Reporters scurried in their droves to catch a word with a man who has captured the imagination of spectators and the media, earning him nicknames "Issaka the Otter" and "Hamadou The Keel," among others.His displays on Dorney Lake have brought back memories of Eric "The Eel" Moussambani, the Equatorial Guinea swimmer who memorably splashed his way through a 100-meter freestyle heat at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.Djibo Issaka learned the basics of rowing in a wooden fishing boat in his home city of Niamey, the Niger capital where he lives with his two kids. Niger is landlocked, 80 percent desert and has few rivers. Rowing clubs? What rowing clubs."Before this week, I hadn't been in a (professional sculling) boat before," he said. "There aren't these kind of boats in Africa."

He swam at a competitive level over distances of 50 and 100 meters in Niger but turned to rowing when the Niger Swimming Federation sent him to Egypt to try it out. He received a wild card for the Olympics from the IOC Tripartite Commission, which allows each National Olympic Committee to enter up to five athletes for the Summer Games.At the start of a two-week camp last November, he took the first step of his new career by climbing into a vessel — and promptly toppling out of it."I fell out," he said, chuckling. "But as a swimmer, that wasn't a problem."When he isn't learning to row, he earns a living gardening and working at a children's swimming pool.Strengthened on a breakfast of chicken and beef, he took to the water Tuesday and was given a huge cheer by the packed grandstands when his name was read before the race.Rowing against competitors from El Salvador, Hong Kong and Peru, Djibo Issaka quickly fell behind. "It's going to be hard for the Niger athlete to come back now," remarked the announcer at the 500-meter mark.By the time Sau Wah So of Hong Kong crossed the line to win the race, Djibo Issaka still had 300 meters left, but the ovation he received was tremendous."I am very happy because they encouraged me and helped me finish. It's all about courage," he said.It's not the last we'll see of him at the Olympics.First, he will return on Friday for the "F'' final against Aymen Mejri of Tunisia and Paul Etia Ndoumbe, who both finished in under 8 minutes in their races Tuesday.But his longer-term goal is to compete at the Rio Olympics in 2016."I'm getting ready for it," he said. "I hope to train in Niger. Maybe new boats will be there now so I will be able to do it."Sports & RecreationRecreational WatercraftNiger

State Department Drones Are Still Patrolling Iraqi Skies

State Department Drones Are Still Patrolling Iraqi Skies
The lead story in The New York Times today concerns U.S. surveillance drones, operated not by the Pentagon or the CIA, but by the State Department, that are patrolling the skies over Iraq even after our combat troops have gone home. In the story, Iraqi officials complain that the drones are an affront to their new nation's sovereignty. RELATED: U.S. Troops Leaving Iraq, But U.S. Presence There Just Ramping UpThe State Department drones do not carry weapons, but are used as sky high lookouts over the massive U.S. embassy and other consulates. The fact that they can't shoot missiles is a distinction that is lost on most Iraqis, given the growing American reputation for striking from the sky without warning.	“We hear from time to time that drone aircraft have killed half a village in Pakistan and Afghanistan under the pretext of pursuing terrorists,” Mr. Salah said. “Our fear is that will happen in Iraq under a different pretext.”Even putting aside Iraqi's natural concerns about another country running spy planes over its land, the program raises potentially bigger questions about diplomats operating what amounts to a spying campaign in someone else's country. The drones have traditionally been the domain of the military, but even as their use has increased in combat operations, it seems they're now becoming a visible part of every aspect of American action overseas. But as the quote above shows, to those living under the "watchful" gaze of unmanned planes, the difference between American security and American aggression isn't much of a difference at all.RELATED: The Foreign Service Officer Who Rants Against the State DepartmentThe program is also another reminder of just how entrenched the American government plans to be in Iraq as the country struggles to find its footing as an independent, democratic nation. If the drones are needed to protect 11,000 U.S. workers at the giant Baghdad embassy, perhaps we should rethink just how big that embassy needs to bePolitics & GovernmentGovernment
