Buffalo Sabres right wing Patrick Kaleta (36) checks Detroit Red Wings defenseman Jakub Kindl (4) during …
UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Sabres forward Patrick Kaleta has been suspended by the NHL for 10 games for an illegal check to the head of Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Jack Johnson last week.The punishment, which will cost Kaleta $152,439 in lost salary, was handed down Tuesday by the league's Department of Player Safety. Kaleta is considered a repeat offender under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players' association.Kaleta was suspended for five games last season after he shoved New York Rangers center Brad Richards from behind and into the boards. That ban cost Kaleta $72,000 in salary. Kaleta was suspended two other times earlier in his career.The latest hit took place at 3:10 of the first period of Buffalo's 4-1 loss to Columbus on Thursday. Kaleta wasn't penalized in the game.Kaleta already missed games against Chicago and Minnesota, while awaiting an in-person hearing on Tuesday. He then sat out that night's game at the New York Islanders.Kaleta's lost salary will go to the Players' Emergency Assistance Fund. He is eligible to return Nov. 2 against Anaheim.Sports & RecreationIce HockeyPatrick KaletaBuffalo SabresColumbus Blue Jackets

Woman's Gifts Of Friendship Are Now Being Sold Online

DEAR ABBY: I have a close friend who is obsessed with selling "finds" on eBay. I often give her little items that she has mentioned she liked -- or outright asked for. I always thought she wanted to keep them for herself. Recently I saw some of the things I gave her for sale under her eBay account. I am dismayed that she is taking advantage of my generosity to make a few bucks. No, she is not desperate. And no, I don't feel comfortable saying something unless it's clever and I won't appear to be jealous or petty. -- TRACI IN PENNSYLVANIADEAR TRACI: You don't have to say anything clever. What you should do is tell your friend that you were hurt when you saw the items she had requested up for sale on her eBay account. Period. And in the future, be a little less generous about providing stock for her retail venture.DEAR ABBY: Over the years, I have seen many letters from soon-to-be-brides asking if they should include their husband's sister or other female friend in their bridal party, even if they don't know them. There is a solution.This summer, I was honored to be the best man at the wedding of a close friend. He had a female friend, "Liz," whom he wanted in the wedding party. Liz didn't know the bride, so instead of having her be a bridesmaid, Liz was a groomswoman. She stood in photos with the groomsmen, and even wore a matching outfit -- a lovely gray dress with a red ribbon to match our gray suits and red ties. -- BEST MAN IN REDMOND, WASH.DEAR BEST MAN: That is certainly an appropriate solution to something that shouldn't be a problem in the first place. Women have also occasionally served in the capacity of "best man." I'm glad you mentioned it.DEAR ABBY: I have seen letters in your column referring to not being invited to children's birthday parties and the hurt that follows. It's amazing to me that some adults have also never learned the importance of being sensitive to the feelings of others.We recently moved into an established neighborhood where a group of adults go on trips, out to dinner, etc. I am old enough to realize that my husband and I will not be invited to everything. But I am not "old enough" not to feel a stab of pain and isolation when group plans are discussed in my presence and we are not invited.Somewhere along the line, people need to learn not to discuss group activities in front of those who are not included. No one wants to feel left out. -- NEWCOMER TO MINNESOTADEAR NEWCOMER: You've said it well. While I don't think the offenders are being deliberately cruel, if people would think before opening their mouths, a lot of hurt feelings could be avoided.DEAR ABBY: I'm just wondering what you and your readers think about this: If you see your doctor only once a year (or less if you are well), but you have been going to that doctor for five years or so, should that doctor remember you? -- LOUISE IN ARIZONADEAR LOUISE: It depends on the volume of patients the doctor has in his (or her) practice. However, before seeing you, the doctor should certainly familiarize himself (or herself) with your file so you are not being seen "cold."Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips. Write Dear Abby at www.DearAbby.com or P.O. Box 69440, Los Angeles, CA 90069.What teens need to know about sex, drugs, AIDS and getting along with peers and parents is in "What Every Teen Should Know." Send your name and mailing address, plus check or money order for $7 (U.S. funds) to: Dear Abby, Teen Booklet, P.O. Box 447, Mount Morris, IL 61054-0447.
