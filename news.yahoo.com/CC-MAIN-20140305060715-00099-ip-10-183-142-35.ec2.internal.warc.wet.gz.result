NRA Releases Shooting Game for Kids (ABC News)
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has released a "Practice Range" Shooting App for iOS, according to Apple's App Store description. The app combines the NRA's facts and educational materials with a 3-D shooting game, which, according to the description, "instills safe and responsible ownership through fun challenges and realistic simulations."The game was first released in the App Store on Sunday, Jan. 13 for children ages 4 and up; the description of the app was updated on Tuesday, Jan. 15 to reflect that it was rated for ages 12 and up.The game includes nine firearms and three different shooting ranges, though you have to pay 99 cents to unlock some of weapons, including a Beretta, MK11 and a Colt pistol. The game is rated for children ages four and up, and says it "strikes the right balance of gaming and safety education, allowing you to enjoy the most authentic experience possible."The app, which is available for the iPhone and iPad was created by MEDL Mobile, and is described in Apple's App Store as an "Official NRA Licensed Product." The NRA and MEDL Mobile did not respond to ABC News' repeated request for comment.NRA Executive Director Wayne LaPierre has argued since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings that video games and movies are to blame for the culture of violence in the United States. "There exists in this country, sadly, a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells and stows violence against its own people, through vicious, violent video games with names like 'Bullet Storm,' 'Grand Theft Auto,' 'Mortal Combat,' and 'Splatterhouse,' " LaPierre said at a press conference on Dec. 21.The app was released just as the NRA finished meeting with Vice President Joe Biden about gun violence. "We were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment," the NRA said in a statement following the meetings last week.Biden also called on game industry leaders. In a meeting with representatives from the video game industry, including members of Electronic Arts, the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, and Activision Blizzard, Biden asked for help. "We're anxious to see if there's anything you can suggest to us that you think would be -- would help, as this president said, diminish the possibility, even if it only saved one kid's life."Technology & ElectronicsSoftwareAppleshooting gameApp Store

Wal-Mart vs. the Mob Michelle Malkin's column is released once a week. By Michelle Malkin

Black Friday always brings out the worst: long lines, short tempers and random outbreaks of shoppers' rage. This year, Big Labor will ratchet up the Strikesgiving tension with professional grievance-mongers and workers picketing at 1,000 Wal-Mart stores nationwide. Attention, Wal-Mart directors: Mob appeasement never works. They've tried repeatedly to stave off union thuggery through political "partnerships" and capitulation. It has failed and failed and failed. As you may recall, the discount retail giant shocked many observers in 2009 when it announced it was embracing the principles of President Obama's federal health care mandate. The nation's largest private (and non-union) employer was joined by its perennial arch-enemy, the Service Employees International Union (then-helmed by frequent White House guest and deep-pocketed heavy Andy Stern) and the far-left Center for American Progress (run by Obama confidante John Podesta and funded by billionaire George Soros). In their joint Obamacare letter, the strange bedfellows declared: "As the nation's largest private employer, the nation's largest union of health care workers with over 1 million members and a think tank that has been a leader on health care policy, we have worked closely in support of health care reform since 2006, when we came together to help break the stalemate that had defined the health care debate for too long." Wal-Mart, SEIU and CAP together endorsed Obamacare's employer mandate and "shared responsibility" provisions, which they called "important proposals that should be included in the current efforts to reform our nation's health care system." These unholy alliances were forged out of Wal-Mart's desperation and political expediency. Providing cover for the White House on Obamacare bought Wal-Mart one day of goodwill theater. But SEIU and Soros operatives have promoted a no-holds-barred campaign against Wal-Mart for decades. The union funded an incendiary "Wal-Mart Watch" website with at least $1 million in rank-and-file employee dues. Wal-Mart foolishly contributed between $500,000 and $999,999 to Podesta and his Soros-backed Center for American Progress. But Soros' MoveOn hit team is now instigating the Black Friday strikes online. Similar corporate outreach to the Congressional Black Caucus brought rebukes from, you guessed it, SEIU leaders, which blasted Wal-Mart for "undermining standards for all American workers." Never mind that Wal-Mart employs 1.3 million people, 250,000 of whom have been there for more than 10 years and 165,000 of whom are hourly associates who were promoted last year. Nor will the company ever have the sympathies of the president — despite first lady Michelle Obama's comfy seat on the corporate board of directors of TreeHouse Foods Inc. Wal-Mart happens to be the conglomerate's biggest customer. The TreeHouse Foods position netted Mrs. Obama $45,000 in 2005 and $51,200 in 2006 — as well as 7,500 TreeHouse stock options worth more than $72,000 for each year. While Mrs. Obama welcomed Wal-Mart's decision to team up with her on her anti-"food deserts" campaign last year, Obama's union cronies at the SEIU and AFL-CIO once again excoriated the nation's largest employer. "Wal-Mart should not be celebrated for false contributions to our communities and glitzy public relations campaigns that disguise their destructive policies," the union bosses railed. President Obama has said nothing about the strike actions, but he made his allegiances clear in 2007, when he told union activists he "would not shop" at Wal-Mart. Company heir Samuel Walton forked over $300,000 to the Priorities USA super PAC, run by former Obama flack Bill Burton. How's that working out? For the sake of its survival, I hope the Black Friday lesson isn't lost on the rest of Wal-Mart's management and heirs. When you lie down with thugs, you get up with ... more black eyes.
