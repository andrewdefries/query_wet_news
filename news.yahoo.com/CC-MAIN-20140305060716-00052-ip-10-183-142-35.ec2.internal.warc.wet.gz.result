BRATTLEBORO, Vt., May 13, 2012 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- World Learning announced today that Donald Steinberg, deputy administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development and a former ambassador, will be the organization's next president and CEO."Donald Steinberg is a true leader in the field of international development. He brings invaluable experience, energy, enthusiasm and an impressive record of achievement to World Learning from his many years of public service," said Rosamond Delori, chair of World Learning's board of trustees. "We look forward to working with him to continue World Learning's efforts to empower people and strengthen institutions around the world."Steinberg will officially begin his role at the organization in early July and will use the interim period to develop a comprehensive understanding of the World Learning's work, which spans more than 60 countries and includes participants from 140 countries annually."It will be a great honor to work with the World Learning staff, board and alumni to continue its remarkable success in global development, international education and exchange, and graduate and professional education," Steinberg said. "I am equally excited at the opportunity to partner with civil society institutions, the private sector, educational institutions and governments around the world to encourage inclusive development."As deputy administrator at USAID, Steinberg's areas of focus included the Middle East and Africa, women's empowerment, organizational reforms under the USAID Forward initiative and enhancing dialogue with development partners. During his nearly 30 years with the government, he served as director of the State Department's joint Policy Council, White House deputy press secretary, National Security Council senior director for African affairs, special Haiti coordinator, U.S. Ambassador to Angola and the president's special representative for humanitarian demining. Steinberg was also deputy president for policy at the International Crisis Group and a Randolph Jennings senior fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace.Steinberg has published more than 100 articles on foreign policy, African developments, gender issues, post-conflict reconstruction, children and armed conflict, and disarmament. He holds master's degrees in journalism from Columbia University and political economy from the University of Toronto, and a bachelor's degree from Reed College.His honors include the Presidential Meritorious Honor Award, the Frasure Award for International Peace, the Hunt Award for Women in Policy Formulation, the Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship, the State Department Distinguished Service Award and six State Department Superior Honor Awards."From our very first meeting with him, it was immediately clear to us—staff and trustees—that Don's dedication to and experience in making the world better for all its citizens was precisely aligned with World Learning's 80 years of work around the globe," Delori said.Steinberg will succeed Adam Weinberg, who announced in November that he would step down as World Learning's president and CEO in June 2013 to become the president of Denison University in Ohio. World Learning selected Steinberg for the position after a five-month search led by former World Learning president and current Trustee Charles MacCormack, which involved trustees, staff, faculty and students. "I look forward to building on the proud legacy of Adam Weinberg and his predecessors and colleagues by helping empower a new generation of global leaders with the skills and values needed to build prosperous and democratic societies," Steinberg said.He and Weinberg will work together closely over the next several months to ensure a smooth and timely transition.To download Steinberg's full biography visit the World Learning website.To learn more about World Learning, read:International Development and Exchange ProgramsThe Experiment in International LivingSIT Study AbroadInternational Honors ProgramSIT Graduate InstituteWorld Learning is a nonprofit organization advancing leadership through education, exchange, and development programs in more than 60 countries.www.worldlearning.org SOURCE World Learning, IncEducationSociety & Culture OrganizationsWorld Learning
