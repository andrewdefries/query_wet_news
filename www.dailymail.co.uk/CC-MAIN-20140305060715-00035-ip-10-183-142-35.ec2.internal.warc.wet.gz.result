Do one intelligent thing in your life. RETIRE. You over stayed your welcome by 20 years. Bitter, desperate, rude ... you have never been entertaining. It would be a JOY to see you leave.

Two thirds of childless working women say they are forced to work longer hours than mothers
This system has been going on for years,especialy in the armed forces.apart from getting marriage allowance,when a married serviceman was abroad he also recieved an increase in pay,the reason being to bring him up to the same status as a single man.Mind you the reason for marriage allowance was,they could not keep a wife on their income.
