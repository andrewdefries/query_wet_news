Emgee I take your point, I don't disagree with you about Barritt. There's no doubt he's a great defender, and he's never let England down, I've said so in previous posts. It's an interesting problem for Stuart Lancaster. I'm not sure Twelvetrees and Tuilagi played together at Leicester much at all for it to be 'underwhelming'....considering Twelvetrees moved to Gloucester to play more rugby because he was hardly playing at Welford Road. If England do stick with Barritt and Twelvetrees, I imagine Brian O'Driscoll would prefer that to having to deal with Tuilagi
