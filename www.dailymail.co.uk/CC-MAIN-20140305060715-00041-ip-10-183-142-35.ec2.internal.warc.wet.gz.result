Frankie Howerd was the master of innuendo. Now secret tapes reveal protests over his smuttiness drove him to drugs

Comment:
I used to see Frankie Howard nearly every morning in Potters Chemist in Malta when I was a child, he was a huge man, very red faced and never smiled - I knew him from the movies but never would have been game to say hello, since reading about his life I wish I had. Sad.
