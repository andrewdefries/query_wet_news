'One bottle of cheap whisky a day quickly doubled to two': James Bulger's father on coming to terms with the grief and rage that very nearly destroyed himRalph Bulger speaks of how he turned to alcohol to numb the painStuck in 'Groundhog Day' he would do anything to escapeJames Bulger was two years old when he was killed on February 12, 1993

In the weeks and months that followed James’s death, my wife Denise and I tried so hard to comfort each other. But it was impossible: we were both so angry. I was not the type who was used to opening up about my feelings. All I knew was that I felt so badly broken that I didn’t believe anything could ever put me back together again. There is no handbook to tell you how to deal with the awful murder of your own son by two young boys.I just wanted to run away from what I was feeling, and that led me to drink. I would drink anything I could lay my hands on, and often that would be pints of lager washed down with large whisky chasers. In so many ways I had given up on life. I would lie in bed during the day, hungover, ill and in a world of physical and mental pain. In the beginning, I was drinking a bottle of cheap whisky a day, but that quickly doubled to two. I would buy the drink and then take myself off in private somewhere. I often used to walk through the night drinking until I arrived at James’s grave, where I would sit for hours and hours just talking to him aloud.

This must have been a terrible time for Denise, too. She was trying to cope with losing our son and she had a husband who kept going missing and was bent on self-destruction. The truth is, I couldn’t cope. I didn’t come from the kind of background where you went to the doctor to ask for counselling or antidepressants, and I sank to a very dark place. To escape from my feelings, I would get in my car and start driving. I never knew where I was going. I would end up in Wales or the Lake District, hours from home. When I arrived, I would buy my bottle of whisky and just go walking through the night. I would sometimes stay away for two or three days. More...

'Thompson was like the Pied Piper, he had a hold': Lawyer recalls 'angelic-looking' face of Jon Venables after James Bulger's brutal killing
I felt as if I was stuck in Groundhog Day. I would think about James constantly. I would grab some of his clothes or his bed linen and hold them to my face so I could still smell him, and I would sob like a baby for hours. I wanted James’s killers dead and I would be lying if I said I felt any other way. But I am not a sadistic or nasty man. As a father, I would never harm or be cruel to children. I felt terrible that I had these feelings, but my responses were primal. Having these thoughts in my head does not mean I will ever spill over into being a killer myself.In November 1993, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables were found guilty of James’s murder. The judge recommended that they serve a minimum of eight years, which would have meant they would be eligible for release at the age of 18: and that was the first kick in the teeth we received from the judicial system. ‘Eight f*****g years! Is that all my son’s life was worth?’ I screamed in despair. Torn apart: Ralph and Denise Bulger pictured in front of James' portrait in 1996 as the killers began legal action
Memorial: Ralph holding James's coffin at the child's funeral in Merseyside in March 1993
Denise was heavily pregnant and on December 16 she gave birth to a little boy. Michael James Bulger came into our lives and for the first time since our son was murdered, I felt real happiness. When I held Michael close to me, I felt overwhelmed with love. But there was still tension at home. Denise and I had been through so much, we were both exhausted. I was too scared to tell her how I really felt, because I knew it would hurt her. The chasm that had opened between us seemed to be getting deeper and wider with every day that passed. Eighteen months after his death, I was still having vivid nightmares about James’s torture and murder. A dream about the gravestone being soaked in blood regularly haunted my sleep. I would wake up bathed in cold sweat. Often it would wake Denise, which was exhausting for her.What we endured was beyond what most people suffer in a lifetime and instead of growing stronger together, the marriage shattered into pieces. I couldn’t return to being the man I was before, so I knew I had to go. People might judge me for leaving Denise after what had happened. Perhaps I was taking flight from our grief. I will always be grateful to her that I had the chance to meet James, even if his stay on this earth was so short. I am sorry I wasn’t able to make the marriage work.Time doesn’t heal; I know that for certain. At this point, I still felt James’s death like a permanent knife in my back. It was in April, 1996 that things started hotting up legally. Lawyers acting for Thompson and Venables had filed applications to the High Court in protest after the then Home Secretary, Michael Howard, raised the minimum tariff of their sentences to 15 years. It was to prove a lengthy legal battle. 'Angelic face': James Bulger pictured as a two-year-old shortly before he was murdered in 1993
Newspapers reported how the pair had their own bedrooms kitted out with en suite shower and toilet, and luxuries such as TVs, games consoles and the latest in designer trainers and clothes. The authorities have never commented one way or the other, but I assumed the press had access to sources I did not and the reports over the years have made my blood boil. It was as if James’s family didn’t matter any more.The legal wrangling went on and on. March 1999 saw the first of two European rulings on the case. The European Commission of Human Rights concluded that the trial for James’s murder had been held in a ‘highly charged’ atmosphere, which led to an unfair judgment. As a result, the trial had been a breach of the human rights of Venables and Thompson. Then, in December of the same year, the European Court of Human Rights echoed the findings of the Commission. It also reinforced the earlier High Court ruling that Michael Howard was wrong to intervene in the sentencing of the two killers. Judges agreed that the pair did not receive a fair trial because it was held in public and subject to intensive press coverage.The whole issue was sickening. Once again, it seemed those in charge had treated James’s killers with kid gloves. Why did we let a European court start dictating what is right or wrong in British law? The high regard I’d once had for our legal system was totally gone. There has to come a time when the victims of crime and their families are put before the rights of the criminals. Failure to do so makes a laughing stock of justice. Wrongful freedom: The front page of the local paper as the news broke of the release of the killers of James Bulger
Killers: Jon Venables, left, and Robert Thompson, right, were convicted of James Bugler's murder aged 10
We believed our views meant nothing to a judicial system that had already decided it wanted to release Thompson and Venables. It felt as if we had been tucked up by a bunch of interfering lawyers from Europe who had hijacked the laws of Great Britain to defend the ‘human rights’ of two young psychopaths.In October 2000, my worst fears came true. The Lord Chief Justice reinstated the original eight-year tariff set by the trial judge. We were back to square one, but even worse, the tariff expired immediately, paving the way for their release. If we had been overprotective already, now we became terrified for our families. I was still living in Kirkby, on the edge of Liverpool, but now with my new partner Eileen and our three young girls, aged six, five and two. The biggest impact fell on Ree, the eldest, who had started school but was already having her freedom clipped. We didn’t like her to go to friends’ houses to play. We didn’t like her to be out of our sight.In January 2001, Thompson and Venables were granted an unprecedented anonymity for the rest of their lives. They were also to be given secret identities.‘What kind of bloody message are we sending out?’ I asked my older brother Jimmy. ‘They have been given everything to make life easy – everything short of a pat on the back and a gold star for savagely murdering an innocent baby. What next, a sodding knighthood? Shattered lives: Ralph and his then-wife Denise plead for their son's safe return a day after he went missing
‘These evil cretins have had better lives as a result of killing my baby than they ever would have if they had stayed at home.’I felt like a snarling animal in a cage that was being prodded with sticks by the upper classes. We didn’t matter because we were ordinary, working-class folk. I couldn’t even say goodbye to my boy at his funeral because he had been so badly mutilated. The judges might have forgotten that. But I never can.The tenth anniversary of James’s death in 2003 was a major turning point in my life. Perhaps it helped that our legal battle seemed to be over: there was no more we could achieve. Thompson and Venables had been freed. I knew the best thing I could do was look after my family, so I finally stopped the binge drinking and, when I wasn’t looking after the kids, I would go training for hours or do a spot of fishing.Talking to our parish priest, Father Michael O’Connell, was the most enormous help. He had been a comfort throughout. But one emotional afternoon, I wept buckets of tears with him and felt not one ounce of embarrassment. Afterwards, I thought about
what he had said. Could I ever stop blaming myself for James’s death? I
just didn’t know if that was possible. The truth is that my anger was the only thing that kept me going sometimes, but I also knew it was eroding every fibre of my humanity. I knew I could never forgive Thompson and Venables, but I desperately wanted to feel normal again. I couldn’t remember what it felt like to start each day with joy and happiness, as I had before James was killed. Father Mick taught me it was OK to feel the way I did.

It was late afternoon on March 2, 2010 when the doorbell rang. And when the two official-looking callers, a man and a woman, said they were from Merseyside CID and the Ministry of Justice, my heart quickened. I knew it could only be related to one thing.‘I am afraid we have to tell you that one of your son’s killers, Jon Venables, has been recalled to prison for breaking the terms of his release,’ said the man. Almost a week later, there were reports that Venables had been hoarding vile child pornography on his laptop and had been dangerously out of control during his years of freedom.He was jailed for just two years. The Ministry of Justice said they had launched a probe into his reoffending and whether he should have been recalled to prison earlier. No public inquiry was ever launched and I’ve never been told the outcome of any investigations by the ministry, and probably never will. The whole episode sent shivers down my spine and the only relief was that Venables was back in jail, where he deserved to be. On the night he began his new prison term, I hugged my girls extra close to me and thanked God they were all safe.It has now been 20 years since that terrible day when James was murdered. He would now be 22. His death still shocks people all these years on and will forever be a stain on our nation’s conscience. I live with it every single day. But in many ways the love and emotion that people from all over the world have expressed has meant James has never been forgotten. His angelic face and, of course, that giggle, encapsulated the very vision of innocence.© Ralph Bulger 2013 My James by Ralph Bulger and Rosie Dunn is published by Sidgwick & Jackson, priced £16.99.

First zoo-born male orangutan to be released into the wild is killed by a poisonous snake after less than 18 months in the rainforest

The world's first zoo-born male orangutan to be released into the wild has been killed by a poisonous snake after just 17 months in the jungle.Seven-year-old Semeru made history in 2011 when Perth Zoo in Western Australia decided he had the right temperament to be released into his natural rain forest habitat in Indonesia.But park rangers on the island of Sumatra were horrified to find his body in the jungle, where he had easily adapted to his surroundings. Poisoned: The seven-year-old orangutan became the first zoo-born male to be released into the wild in 2011
However an investigation has now begun into whether his background of being born and raised for six years in a zoo left him without the basic instincts needed to protect himself from the dangers of the jungle.'We have been keeping track of Semeru ever since he was released into a protected part of the rainforest and he seemed to be doing well,' said a spokesman for Indonesia's orang-utan rehabilitation department.

'We found a snake bite and tests have since proved he died from toxic poisoning.'His death might also have been due to what zoo officials said was his independent and curious nature. Instincts: Officials are looking into whether Semeru's upbringing at Perth Zoo left him without the basic instincts to cope in the jungle
Whether his curiosity had led to him approaching and perhaps trying to handle a toxic snake is a question that no-one will be able to answer.A spokeswoman for Perth Zoo said: 'All the staff are devastated at this loss, but we're glad that Semeru was able to spend part of his life in the wild.'Semeru was transported from Perth Zoo in October 2011 to Bukit Tigapuluh in Sumatra as part of the Sumatran orang-utan re-introduction programme to establish a new population of the crtically-endangered species in the wild.He was born at Perth Zoo in June 2005 to mother Sekara and father Dinara.Zoo officials said Sekara was an excellent first-time mother and doted on Semeru, the first of the third generation of orang-utans born at the zoo.He was chosen for the release programme because of his age and temperament.Officials said he had reached the natural age of dispersal for a male orang-utan and was confident, curious and independent. The world's first female orang-utan to be released into the wild was Temara, who was also born at Perth Zoo.She was released in the same area as Semeru in 2006 and is said to have adapted well to her surroundings.Indonesia has four extremely dangerous snakes, the venom of which can bring about death in an hour or so. Venomous: The black cobra (pictured) is one of a number of highly dangerous snakes found in Indonesia, along with the pit viper, the king cobra and the banded krait
They include: the banded krait, the bite of which causes muscle weakness, loss of co-ordination and eventually respiratory paralysis. Victims have only a 50 per cent chance of surviving.The black spitting cobra and the king cobra, the bite of both causing pain, muscle weakness and respiratory paralysis.The pit viper, which causes great pain, bleeding and tissue damage, and the tree snake, which also causes death through paralysis of heart and lungs.
