He was best known for his role as the complex mob boss and family man Tony Soprano on the hit HBO series The Sopranos.So it is touching to discover that behind-the-scenes, James Gandolfini – who died suddenly from a suspected heart attack on Wednesday – was considered to be one of the family by his colleagues.Tributes from his co-workers on the show immediately poured out following the tragic news of his death, lead by the Emmy-winning creator of the show David Chase. Scroll down for video Family man: James Gandolfini, seen here as mob boss Tony Soprano, was considered to be member of the family to his colleagues on the hit HBO show
James Gandolfini in some of his most memorable film & TV roles
‘He is one of the greatest actors of this or any time,’ said Chase.‘A great deal of that genius resided in those sad eyes. I remember telling him many times, 'You don't get it. You're like Mozart.' There would be silence at the other end of the phone.’He added: "For [wife] Deborah and [son] Michael and [daughter] Lilliana this is crushing. And it's bad for the rest of the world. He wasn't easy sometimes. But he was my partner, he was my brother in ways I can't explain and never will be able to explain.’ Tribute: David Chase, creator of The Sopranos, seen here with Gandolfini in Beverly Hills in March 1999 at the very beginning of their journey together
Mob: Steven Van Zandt seen standing to the left of James Gandolfini (middle) said he had lost his 'brother' in a touching message
Respect: Sopranos creator David Chase described Gandolfini as being 'like Mozart'
Gandolfini had reunited with Chase for The Sopranos creator’s feature film debut Not Fade Away, a 2012 drama in set in 1960s New Jersey in with Gandolfini starring as the father of a teenage rock ‘n’ roll band lead singer. Fans of the show had anticipated a Sopranos movie from the pair, with some rumours of a prequel about the Sopranos’ grandparents first coming to America from Italy.For Chris Albrecht, who originally gave the green light for the family drama back in 1999, and was personally responsible for selecting Gandolfini in the role, his untimely death came as an immense shock. He told Deadline that he was ‘absolutely stunned.’‘I got the word from Lorraine Bracco and just got off with Brad Grey who had just heard from David Chase. We had all become a family. This is a tremendous loss.'Joe Gannascoli, who played Vito Spatafore on the HBO drama, said he was shocked and heartbroken.'Fifty-one and leaves a kid -- he was newly married. His son is fatherless now ... It's way too young,' Gannascoli said. More...

I am very sad.’Steven Van Zandt, who played Silvio Dante on the HBO drama, Tweeted on Wednesday night, ‘I have lost a brother and a best friend.

Partners: Lorraine Bracco, who played Tony Soprano's psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi, pictured here, said she had one of the 'greatest partners' in Gandolfini
Lorraine Bracco, who played Tony Soprano's psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi in the show, said: 'I had the greatest sparring partner in the world, I had Muhammad Ali. He cares what he does, and does it extremely well.'Brad Grey, The Sopranos‘ executive producer, also told Deadline: 'Jimmy was one of the most talented, authentic and vulnerable actors of our time. He was unorthodox and truly special in so many ways. He had the sex appeal of Steve McQueen or Brando in his prime as well as the comedic genius of Jackie Gleason.Gandolfini’s managers, Mark Armstrong and Nancy Sanders, who along with cable channel HBO confirmed his death in Italy, said, ‘Our hearts are shattered and we will miss him deeply. He and his family were part of our family for many years and we are all grieving.’The Sopranos was considered by many to be groundbreaking television, and ran from 1999 until 2007 on HBO.

Sign of respect: A reserved sign was put on the very table used in The Sopranos in honor of actor James Gandolfini who died Wednesday in Italy
TONY SOPRANO'S MOST MEMORABLE QUOTES FROM THE HBO SERIES'You know my feelings: Every day is a gift. It's just, does it have to be a pair of socks?''What kind of (expletive) human being am I, if my own mother wants me dead?'About his father: 'The belt was his favorite childhood development tool.''Nothing beats popping up some Orville Redenbachers and listening to `Men in Black.'''Nowadays, everybody's gotta go to shrinks and counselors, and go on `Sally Jessy Raphael' and talk about their problems. What happened to Gary Cooper? The strong, silent type.''I gotta be honest with you. I'm not getting any satisfaction from my work.''I'm like King Midas in reverse. Everything I touch turns to (expletive).''You got any idea what my life would be worth if certain people found out I checked into a laughing academy?''When you're married, you'll understand the importance of fresh produce.''It wasn't like it was friggin' Cobain. It was just a little suicidal gesture, that's all.'

The clip from Rome was pointless, and the VW Golf ad that led into it of Frank Sinatra tribute singers singing 'My Way' was a bit crass. It's like a PR man was waiting for a famous Italian American to die. 6

The Writers Guild of America unveiled its picks for the 101 best-written TV series of all time over the weekend, and The Sopranos whacked the competition. That was published on June 3rd. Not hard to believe at all. I've owned the entire set of DVDs for years and watched them several times. James Gandolfini WAS The Sopranos. What a great human being. He PLAYED a part. I've read comments about him that are in regard to what he did in the Sopranos. You KNOW he was a good actor when people are trashing him because they thought that's the way he lead his persona life. He stayed on with HBO and even got involved with other series about our US Military. He was taken from us way too soon. God bless his real family and his TV family which I know are in deep shock and grief at this time.

Too young to die, very sad news, very very sad for his children too. Tony Soprano was a gift of a role for any actor, he had great writers to thank for that. "The Sopranos" was really a fantastic TV show.
