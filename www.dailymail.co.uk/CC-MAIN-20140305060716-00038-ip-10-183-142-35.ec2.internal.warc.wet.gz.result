Don't comment, then. See: Questions mostly have easy answers. They don't need to be convoluted; you don't need to use all kinds of mental gymnastics or fudge. Well, I guess you do if you believe a supernatural entity made everything.

Raise the Ba, Arsene: Wenger makes loan bid for Chelsea striker - and also has his eye on PSG star Pastore

Why should Mourinho object to Ba joining Arsenal? He didn`t think that being rivals should prevent United from selling Rooney to Chelsea.

'It's making children cry': Police tell man to tone down annual charity Halloween display in honour of his grandmother

So millions of kids cried and hid behind the settee when Dr Who was on. Did we send the police round to the BBC? Of course not! If we were scared - we could go to another room, likewise there is an alternative route.

The pot prospectors: How middle America is piling into the 'Green Rush' and quitting their jobs to grow and sell marijuana

Comment:
Marijuana makes people boring. And awkward and lazy, too. You know I'm correct- would you rather have a conversation with someone who has smoked a joint or one who had drunk a beer? If you took your car in for repairs, would you offer the mechanic a joint before he started the job?
