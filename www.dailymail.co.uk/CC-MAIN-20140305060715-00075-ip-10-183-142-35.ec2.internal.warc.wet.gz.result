I wonder what that must feel like - to have every person who knows or knows of you to just wish that you were dead because you're nothing but a hated burden. I can't imagine there's anyone on this earth who cares anything about him. He's a walking dead soul.

Adkins looks on bright side after Swansea draw despite another defensive mistake By

Nigel Adkins focused on Southampton's improved performance today despite yet another defensive mistake costing his side three points against Swansea.Saints had the better of proceedings at St Mary's after a week in which the position of the struggling side's manager had come under increasing scrutiny.Adkins' team responded with character and took the lead 64 minutes in when Morgan Schneiderlin made their dominance count by nodding home from close range. Bright side: Nigel Adkins drew positives from his side's draw despite a goalkeeping error against Swansea
However, the Premier League's leakiest defence was founding wanting once more as goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga's poor pass to Maya Yoshida was picked off by one-time Southampton academy graduate Nathan Dyer, who punished the hosts.'I think the supporters, players and everyone is having a go for each other, which is the important thing,' Adkins said.'We're together as one. Everyone is having a right go, the performance was good.'Listen, take the positives. We got a point. We wanted the three and a clean sheet but let's take the positives.'We got another point on the board. Everyone's together, everyone is working hard.'We're 11 games into the Barclays Premier League and we're improving all the time.'We believe we can give all sorts of teams problems going forward, which we've gone and done this season. We've scored goals.'It is the decision-making process at the back [which is the issue]. Today was an improvement in respect of the defensive resolve about ourselves.'Again, the second half against Tottenham, you throw that into the mix. We were on the front foot and dominated that second half.'There is a lot of good things that we're doing and we'll stick at it and keep working hard.'Asked if the result had helped reduce the pressure building at the club, Adkins added: 'I think you can see again today that the football club is united and we're determined to be successful here at Southampton. Haunted: Nathan Dyer scored against his old club
In front: Morgan Schneiderlin (left) had put Southampton in the lead earlier in the match
'We should have had a penalty the other night but didn't get one so at this moment in time things just aren't going are way, but we'll keep working.'Adkins took his side away for a break in the build-up to the game and shuffled his side around in a bid to take the three points.Luke Shaw was one of those brought into the side, with the 17-year-old left-back becoming Southampton's youngest ever starter in the Premier League.'I don't think it was a gamble at all because we believe in him,' Adkins said.'I think if he hadn't have been ill after the Stevenage game, he was knocking on the door then.'We want competition for places and we've got a very young side. I don't know what the average age was but we believe in the youth system we've got here and we want to give them the opportunity to go and perform and play. Hard fought: Michael Laudrup (left) felt his side deserved the point at St Mary's
'Unfortunately he has come off with a bit of cramp there before the end, which is understandable I would imagine.'I thought Danny Fox did ever so well when he came on so again competition for places is what you want.'Southampton moved up to 19th after a match in which Swansea manager Michael Laudrup was relieved to get a draw.'I am pleased with a point,' the Dane said. We knew already before the game that it would be very difficult.'I think that I said in the press conference on Thursday that we would like to win against Southampton, but they need a win.'You could really see that. They gave everything in every moment so it was a really difficult game. I think we can be satisfied with going away from here with a point.'I think we did well in the first half. We did not create much today, to be honest, and in the second half they put us under pressure.'If I have to be positive, there are two things. One is obviously the point and the other is, like last Saturday [against Chelsea], we came back from 1-0 down.'That once again shows character in what was a very difficult away game.' More...
