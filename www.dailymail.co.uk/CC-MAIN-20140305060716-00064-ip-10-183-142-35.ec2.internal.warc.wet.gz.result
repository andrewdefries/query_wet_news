We always thought Jimmy Savile was creepy, say Bruce Forsyth and Paul McCartney as Strictly host claims paedophile's fundraising led others to trust him

What's that, Sirs? You always thought Jimmy Saville was creepy? Well why didn't you tell anyone else? We all thought that a scarecrow in a tracksuit sucking on a cigar bigger than a log was a perfectly sane, stable, well thought of person. Thanks for stating the obvious 50 years later ............... when he's dead.
