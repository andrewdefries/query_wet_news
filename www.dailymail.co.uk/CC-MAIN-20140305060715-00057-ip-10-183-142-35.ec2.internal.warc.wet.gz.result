Latest 'Bigfoot sighting' racks up 2m hits on YouTube (even though camera turns away at the key moment)

Rumours of large hairy ape-like creatures roaming through the forests of North America have sparked curiosity and debate for decades.And the latest possible sighting of Bigfoot by Beard Card on a camping trip with three of his siblings in Provo Canyon, Utah, has triggered just as much interest.Mr Card says he spotted what appeared to be a black bear shuffling about behind trees near Squaw Peak and Little Rock Canyon last week.Scroll down for video Is this dark character lurking in the woods Bigfoot or just the latest in a long line of hoaxes and false sightings?
He began filming but suddenly the dark-coloured creature appeared to stand upright and turn towards the camera.Unfortunately, a moment later a frightened Mr Card flees from the scene. In the panic the camera spins away from the subject and the image becomes shaky as .Despite it's amateur nature the video has already attracted more than 2million hits on YouTube as skeptics and believers in the Bigfoot phenomenon dissect the latest piece of evidence.Speaking on to Fox 13 Mr Card said he had wandered into the area to get a closer look at the scores of deer which are rife at the moment.He said: 'None us us have ever believed in Bigfoot or anything. We all have these different ideas about what it was. I am almost positive that it wasn't a bear and it was so huge I don't know what that was. When he first started filming the moving dark image in Provo Canyon in Utah Beard Card thought it was a black bear
What appears to be an arm raises upwards as the the creature stands on two feet and begins to walk away
'We had nothing to do with it. None of our friends knew where we were going to be that night. I highly doubt there was anybody there hiding in a gorilla suit what with it being deer hunting season.'Mr Card said he ran straight to the car leaving a lot of camping stuff at the spot.THE MYSTERY OF BIGFOOTBigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is described as a hairy, ape-like creature purportedly living in forests, mainly in the Northwest of North America.Scientists have rejected the beast's existence, and sightings are widely considered to be either misidentification or hoaxes.Yet
some scientists, including Idaho State University's Jeff Meldrum, have taken interest in further investigations into sightings.The
most famous sighting of the beast was in 1967, with footage taken of a seven-foot-tall, hairy biped by Roger Patterson on the Klamath River in California.Images have been taken more recently, including by hunter Rick Jacobs in 2007 who captured a beast using a camera attached to a tree. It was dismissed as a 'bear with mange'.
There was certainly a large slice of cynicism about the possibility of the creature being Bigfoot from YouTube viewers. One wrote: 'Looks like a guy in a hoodie.'Another said: 'The brush makes the bear arm look like a big gorilla forearm. But yeah, it's﻿ a black bear.'There have been numerous Bigfoot sightings over the years and this latest spot comes after teenagers in woods near Mink Creek in Franklin County said they noticed a dark creature watching them from a ridge in May.On that occasion one of the students managed to grab his camera to film the large figure retreating between the trees.There were also three separate 'sightings' of yetis in Siberia last month.All
were in the remote Kemerovo region, where around 30 'abominable snowmen' live, according to the country's leading researcher on the creatures. In one previously undisclosed case last month near Myski village, fishermen in a
boat on a river initially mistook distant figures first for bears and then people, said the Siberian Times'We shouted to them - do you need help?,' said fisherman Vitaly Vershinin.'They just rushed away, all in fur, walking on two legs, making their way through the bushes and with two other limbs, straight up the hill.'
Lack of evidence: Scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax (stock picture)
He said: "What did we think? It could not be bears, as the bear walks on all-fours, and they ran on two.... so
then they were gone.'On a second sighting on the bank of the Mras-Su River several days later, an unnamed fisherman was quoted saying: 'We saw some tall animals looking like people.'VIDEO: Watch 'Bigfoot' hiding behind trees in Utah	Share or comment on this article

Hope people leave these poor creatures alone, especially hunters who have shot and killed many Bigfoots already. They are losing their natural habitat, huge swathes of pristine forest and clean rivers.

In all fairness, If some big furry thing stood up in the brush right in front of me and took a step forward, I'd probably have bolted like greased lightening too. One does wish that the guy had a little bit more fortitude for a couple more second though.

The family are only able to visit 15-year-old Justina at the hospital (pictured) for one hour every week, and can speak only twice a week on the phone for 20 minutes at a time
Justina was admitted to Boston Children's Hospital to receive treatment from a specialist she has known since her diagnosis. Upon admission however a team of new doctors allegedly swooped in on the teen and came up with a different conclusion about her condition. They also cast doubt on whether she had ever had mitochondrial disease, suggesting she in fact suffering from Somafotorm disorder - a psychological condition that manifests itself in
physical symptoms. More...

After the conflicting diagnosis, doctors allegedly gave Justina's parents the heart-breaking news that they wouldn't be able to take their daughter home. Nine months after the incident. Mr and Mrs Pelletier remain embroiled in a bitter custody battle with the hospital who allow Justina so little time to see her family she has resorted to smuggling letters to them in origami artwork. 'This one’s in her artwork,' says Justina’s sister, Jennifer, pointing to a folded note. Justina has resorted to hiding handwritten notes to her family in origami artwork
Despite being diagnosed with the condition which can affect muscle coordination and mobility, 15-year-old Justina lived a normal life until being taken to Boston Children's Hospital in February
'It's kidnapping': Justina's parents Lou and Linda Pelletier have been left embroiled in a bitter custody battle with the hospital 'I know you trust in me. Don’t forget it. I love you more than everything in the whole world. Justina,' Linda Pelletier reads from one note.The Massachusetts Department of Children and Families allows Justina’s parents just one hour-long visit per week and two twenty minute phone calls. Before being taken to hospital after coming down with the flu in February, Justina enjoyed a normal life and was a keen ice-skaterSpeaking
of the moment their daughter was taken away from her, the teenager's mother said: ''They came in, and they said we cannot take Justina out of
the hospital. 'They called DCF (Department for Children and Families). 'They said Justina had 'somatoform disorder,' a form of mental illness that is characterized by physical symptoms.'Linda
and her husband Lou Pelletier were escorted out of the hospital by security, and within the short space of four days they had lost custody of their beloved daughter. 'It's beyond any wildest nightmare that you could think of,' said the teenager's father. 'It's kidnapping,' he told Fox CT. 'It's the most bizarre situation I've ever been involved with,' said Dean Hokanson, Justina's clinical psychologist. 'They were actually being accused of being too active in pursuing healthcare matters for their child,' said Hokanson who has been involved with the Pelletier family for five years. Now, the family is locked into a bitter custody battle with the hospital that has
allegedly accused them of 'overmedicalizing' their child. Doctors at Boston Children's Hospital involved the Department of Children and Families after asserting Justina's parents were 'overmedicalizing' her THE CONFLICTING DIAGNOSES THAT HAVE RIPPED THE PELLETIER FAMILY APARTJustina was diagnosed with mitochondrial disease several years ago, a genetic condition that affects muscle coordination and mobility. The illness includes a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to intracellular structures that produce energy.There is no cure for the condition that is progressive and can cause death. Symptoms can include weakness, intolerance for exercise, heart failure, dementia and rhythm disturbances. Every year 1,000 to 4,000 children in the United states are born with a mitochondrial disease.After being admitted to Boston Children's Hospital in February however doctors concluded the teenager was suffering from Somafotorm disorder, a psychological condition that causes sufferers to feel pain, although there is no physical cause for it. Sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel, rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain.Doctors cannot identify the sources of patients' pain and instead prescribe antidepressants. Patients can become increasingly frustrated with the diagnosis as there is seemingly no explanation for their symptoms. Experts
estimate that between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and less than 0.2. per cent of men in the US suffer from the condition.
While the Pelletier family were able to give their account before the court case began, the Department of Children and Families and Boston Children's hospital could not comment on the case following a judge's decision to prohibit public statements. A spokesperson for the DCF said the Department tried to 'abide' by the recommendations of doctors where possible
Internal discharge documents however reveal why the hospital may have felt inclined to involve child protection authorities. A report, written in April 2013 by one
of the hospital's staff states how doctors took Justina off many of the
medications she was taking at the time she was admitted.'Due to concerns regarding Justina’s regressive behavior changes around her family, the multiple medical procedures and care episodes she has been through … and both parents’ resistance towards recommended treatment plans for Justina … a child protection team was convened,' it read.The Pelletier family however provided proof that every procedure and prescription in Justina's medical history was sanctioned by doctors, including Tufts Medical Center specialist, Dr Mark Korson. In an email to the family, the doctor wrote: 'I am dismayed... it feels like Justina's treatment team is out to prove the diagnosis at all costs... The team has demanded that Justina be removed from the home... This represents the most severe and intrusive intervention a parent can undergo... for a clinical hunch.' Dr. Amel Karaa of Massachusetts General Hospital, says conditions like mitochondrial disorder commonly lead to confusion for health care providers.She told Fox news: 'A lot of social cases have been reported where the children were taken away from their parents by social services and the hospital because the medical team thought that the parents were causing this to their child.'The Pelletiers continue to fight the hospital to regain custody of Justina. They will appear again in court on December 5. Read more:

Confused. It is REQUIRED to have genetic tests to prove mitochondrial genetic disorder before diagnosis. Surely she had these done.
Psy "care" workers ignore physical proof all the time (usu b/c they can't understand it). They use gossip and opinion to "diagnose". Psych is political hell, and nothing else. Numerous studies have proven psy drugs most often cause more damage and rarely help. psy "doctors" ignore medical, genetic science all the time. This is why there's so much exponentially increasing "mental illness" today --- their corruption, damage, and crimes are causing it. Review any historical and current FACTUAL data .... psych "treatments" rarely- usually never - heal, and usually make patients worse & addicted w/ more drug side effects ruining their lives.
Studies prove that MOST psych "doctors" are those who nearly failed medical school - they are morons who ignore helpful, healing TRUE science.

Children's hospital is one of the best hospitals I have ever been to. They delivered my twins and have dealt with everything from asthma and food allergies to speech therapy for my children. I find it hard to believe they would keep her if it wasn't in their best interest. 280

As a parent whose child is a patient of Boston Children's, I can absolutely say that the hospital is an incredibly well-run, caring, professional and utterly capable facility. It is the best in the country, by far. Boston Children's goes above and beyond to ensure the optimum health of every child that comes through its doors. Our child, and many others (whose parents we have spent time with), received misdiagnoses elsewhere and it is only at Boston that we finally found out what was wrong. It took time, but we found out. Child illness can manifest itself in so many different ways that are not the same as adult symptoms and those symptoms can also change over time. Boston Children's knows what it is doing and the multi-disciplinary teams do not operate in isolation, they constantly communicate. Something other than the Daily Mail's interpretation of the story is obviously going on, so judging both the hospital and the parents just because of one article is very premature.

AVB and Pearce lead emotional tributes to Sir Bobby at charity event to mark former England manager's 80th birthday By

A host of stars turned out to pay their respects to Sir Bobby Robson at a charity event that would have marked his 80th birthday.Andre Villas-Boas and Stuart Pearce both paid tribute to Robson, who
led England to the semi-finals of World Cup in 1990 as well as managing
Newcastle, Barcelona, FC Porto and Ipswich during a glittering career.The fundraising event for the Bobby Robson Foundation was planned before the ex-England manager's death from cancer in 2009. Everybody needs good neighbours: And Andre Villas-Boas had one of the best in Sir Bobby Robson, who inspired the Portuguese to go into management
Tottenham boss was glowing in his praise of the great man, who he lived next door to during Robson's spell at Porto.The Portuguese told the Northern Echo: 'Sir Bobby is one of the great managers of the game and without him I probably would not be where I am now. 'He offered me a unique opportunity to get involved in football, taking me under his wing when I was still a
teenager. His enthusiasm and passion for management certainly rubbed off on me. 'He was not only a great manager but a
great man and I will never forget his generosity towards me, he will always be an inspiration.' Respect: Current Newcastle boss Alan Pardew (left) attended the charity event with Steve Harper (centre) and Shola Ameobi (right)
Pearce took
to the stage to regale the audience with his memories of England's most
successful World Cup campaign since 1966 under Robson's leadership.The current England Under 21 coach said of Robson: 'He was a great statesman of the game and had so much enthusiasm and he was someone who was respected all over the country.'Newcastle's present manager Alan Pardew was also in attendance with Shola Ameobi and Steve Harper, along with Sunderland manager Martin O'Neill.Ameobi said he will take the spirit of Sir Bobby with him in Newcastle upcoming match with Metalist Kharkiv. Past master: Robson in action for West Brom, a club that he made 239 appearances between 1956-62
'Listen, I take him everywhere with me,' he said. 'He made me who I am today. 'He encapsulates everything football means to me and his enthusiasm for the game was imparted on me.'Durham's former England fast bowler Steve Harmison, a Newcastle fan, also paid his respects: 'When you look around at all the people here tonight you can see how much Sir Bobby meant to the rest of the country, but especially to the North East, most importantly to the black and white half.'A specially recorded interview before Robson's death was shown and the famous grey jacket he wore during Italia 90 was on show for the audience. Perfect fit: Robson (seen here wearing the famous grey suit) came agonisingly close to leading England to their first World Cup final since 1966
The ex-Newcastle manager's son Mark Robson commented: 'This was dad’s proudest years, he was a proud Englishman. 'It brings back great memories, especially seeing the television footage of him in that jacket with the Three Lions badge.'Lady Elsie, his widow, said: 'It is a night to remember for many reasons. 'We’ve had such generous support from
so many people. Too many to mention, really. But the team organising things deserve to be singled out for their dedication. They’re wonderful
and so committed and professional.'The charity event also hosted numerous stars outside the world of sport and was hosted by Jim Rosenthal and former Lindisfarne singer Billy Mitchell. Inspiration: Robson led Stuart Pearce and his team-mates to the semi finals of the World Cup in 1990
Another legend of the North East, Dire Straits guitarist Mark Knopfler, continued the tributes: 'It means a lot to me to be a part of this celebration of the life of Sir Bobby Robson,' he said.
'Thanks to the commitment and determination of Sir Bobby and the generosity of thousands of people in the North East, the foundation has achieved an enormous amount in the fight against cancer. May it go from strength to strength.'Comedian Alistair McGowan said: 'Bobby was a huge part of my growing up. I cheered on his Ipswich in Europe and our England against the world. Royalty: Robson celebrates winning the King's Cup with Barcelona
Champion: Robson celebrates with his players and coaching staff (Jose Mourinho, right) as manager of Porto
'He was always so passionate about his work and yet always dignified and ready to laugh, qualities often missing in modern football. 'I met him on a couple of occasions and he really was a true gentleman and very nice to my mother so I’m delighted to help raise money for his foundation.'
Sir Bobby Robson - A Celebration was held in aid of The Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, which was launched in March 2008, the year before his death at the age of 76
The charity has raised almost £5m to help fellow cancer sufferers in the North East. Legend: Robson will always be regarded as a hero at St James' Park
