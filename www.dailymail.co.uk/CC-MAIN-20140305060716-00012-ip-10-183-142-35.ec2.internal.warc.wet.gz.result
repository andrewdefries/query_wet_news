Immortalised in the film The Great Escape, the mass breakout from PoW camp Stalag Luft III on March 24-25, 1944, was swiftly followed by terrible retribution – the cold-blooded murder of 50 recaptured prisoners, on Hitler’s direct orders Fifty of the Allied airmen who tunnelled out of Stalag Luft III were executed in chilling scenes like this. In 1946, RAF Special Investigation Branch officers reconstructed the murders of Squadron Leader Thomas Kirby-Green and Flying Officer Gordon Kidder near Zl�n, Moravia, (above). Gestapo officer Erich Zacharias was hanged for his role
On March 29, 1944, Australian Squadron Leader James Catanach and three fellow Allied airmen found themselves languishing in a Nazi prison just a few miles short of the Danish border. After being prisoners inside Stalag Luft III, a notorious PoW camp located 100 miles south-east of Berlin, freedom had seemed so close just days before. Two years after being shot down over Norway, Catanach had been part of the most daring escape of the war. Some 76 Allied airmen had tunnelled out, before attempting to disperse across Europe and escape back to Britain. The 22-year-old Aussie spoke fluent German and believed – wrongly, as it transpired – that he had a reasonable chance of making it to neutral Sweden.Catanach and Arnold Christensen of the Royal New Zealand Air Force had managed to make their way to the railway station at Sagan, the town nearest the camp, and catch the express to Berlin. They spent the night in the capital, avoiding detection, and purchased train tickets to Flensburg. It was here, in this ancient city on the Baltic coast, that they were spotted and arrested.Now, with Christensen and fellow escapees Hallada Espelid and Nils Fuglesang, Norwegians with the Royal Air Force, Catanach sat wondering what awaited them. They assumed the Germans would return them to a prison camp, as was normal protocol. STILL IN THEIR ESCAPE CLOTHES: Photographs of (from left) Lieutenants Hallada Espelid and Nils Fuglesang, Norwegians with the RAF, Australian Squadron Leader James Catanach and Pilot Officer Arnold Christensen of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, taken by the Kriminalpolizei shortly after their arrest in Flensburg in March 1944. All four were murdered by the Nazis
But that afternoon, Major Johannes Post of the Gestapo and his comrade Oskar Schmidt arrived to question the quartet. Post, 38 years old and a stocky five-and-a-half-feet tall, was an ardent Nazi, fanatical in his loyalty to Hitler and intimidating to all who knew him.The interrogation proving futile, the prisoners were handcuffed and marched to the waiting cars outside. Post took custody of Catanach in his car and set off with his driver, eyeing his captive in the rear-view mirror. Out in the countryside, where the road curved sharply to the right, the Mercedes came to a halt.Catanach was told to get out and cross the road, where a gate opened into a meadow. Without uttering a word, Post then pulled a Luger 7.65mm pistol from his pocket and shot Catanach between the shoulder blades, killing him instantly.As Post pocketed his weapon, the second car arrived. Schmidt ordered his driver to pull in behind the Mercedes. The journey back to Sagan, he told his three prisoners, would take several more hours. The men would be wise to relieve themselves. Schmidt and his two partners marched the prisoners across the road. One of the airmen saw a dark object lying in the grass. The realisation that it was Catanach drew a panicked scream. Frances McKenna had been a detective-sergeant in Blackpool, where his dedication had earned him the nickname 'Sherlock Holmes'All three jumped backward and tried to scramble away before three gun reports echoed across the meadow. Two of the airmen fell lifeless; the third hit the ground but struggled, opening his mouth as though wanting to speak. Post approached the airman and put a bullet in his head.Built on Hermann G�ring’s orders, Stalag Luft III sat in a clearing in pine forest 200 miles south of Germany’s Baltic coast. The camp holding Allied airmen was designed to be escape-proof. The barracks were set on stilts.
Concrete pilings that served as foundations for each washroom and kitchen were dug into the earth. Prisoners would have to dig through these before they even hit soil. And the Germans sank microphones 10ft underground to pick up the sounds of any subterranean activity.Squadron Leader Roger Bushell was 32 years old when he arrived in 1942. He had already been a prisoner for two years and had a reputation as a veteran escape artist. Assuming command of the escape committee, Bushell hatched a plot to break out 250 inmates.The audacious plan called for the simultaneous digging of three tunnels named Tom, Dick and Harry. To avoid the microphones, vertical shafts would be dug 30ft down before horizontal digging commenced. To reach the cover of the nearby forest, he estimated that tunnels would have to reach at least 200ft.Disaster struck in September 1943 when Tom was discovered, but by March 1944 it was thought Harry – at 336ft – had reached the cover of the trees. The escape was set for Friday, March 24, a moonless evening.On the night, freezing temperatures had hardened the ground. It took more than an hour to open the exit shaft, only to reveal a near-catastrophe: Harry fell a good 20ft short of the forest, meaning escapees had to risk crawling across open, snow-covered ground to the trees.By four in the morning, it was decided the 87th man in the tunnel would be the last to go. Above ground, meanwhile, a sentry patrolling the perimeter approached the edge of the woods to relieve himself, only to notice steam rising from the ground. As he approached, three escapees broke cover with their arms raised high. Startled, the guard fired a single shot into the air.Armed guards swarmed the compound and eventually a roll call was taken. The numbers tallied were startling. Seventy-six men had escaped. Stalag Luft III, the notorious PoW camp located 100 miles south-east of Berlin, was the scene of a mass breakout in March 1944
Hitler’s rage was all-consuming. He summoned SS chief Heinrich Himmler and Reichsmarschall G�ring and ordered that all 76 fugitives be executed upon recapture. Word of such an atrocity, G�ring explained, might result in fierce Allied reprisals. Himmler agreed, prompting Hitler to order that ‘more than half the escapees’ be shot. Random numbers were suggested until Himmler proposed that 50 be executed. Hitler ordered his SS chief to put the plan in motion.The Kriminalpolizei (the criminal-investigations department of the Reich police) issued a Grossfahndung, a national hue and cry, ordering the military, the Gestapo, the SS, the Home Guard and Hitler Youth to put every effort into hunting the escapees down. Nearly 100,000 men needed to defend the Reich were redirected to the manhunt.By Wednesday, March 29, five days after the breakout, 35 escapees languished behind bars in the cramped cells of the jail at G�rlitz, not far south of Sagan. Those who remained on the run hoped to make destinations in Czechoslovakia, Spain, Denmark and Sweden. Luck, however, worked against them. They were seized at checkpoints, betrayed by informants or simply thwarted by freezing temperatures. Before long, all but three of the fugitives were back in captivity. Two weeks after the escape, the whereabouts of the escapees remained a mystery to the prisoners inside the camp. Just six men had thus far been returned to Stalag Luft III and marched directly into the cooler, the solitary-confinement block. Murdered in cold blood: A list of the escapees, with photos, who were shot. Among the dead were 25 Britons, six Canadians, three Australians, two New Zealanders, three South Africans, four Poles, two Norwegians, one Frenchman and a Greek
But on April 6, Group Captain Herbert
Massey, the senior British officer in the camp, was to learn the fate of so many of his men. The
camp commandant, Colonel Braune, informed him that 41 had been killed while resisting arrest or attempting to escape after being captured; not
one had been merely wounded. Braune was unable to look Massey in the eye as he told him the lies.On
April 15, a list identifying the victims appeared on the camp’s noticeboard. The list now contained not 41 names, but 47. Two days later, a representative of the Swiss Protecting Power visited Stalag Luft III on a routine inspection and was given a copy of the list. Among
the dead were 25 Britons, six Canadians, three Australians, two New Zealanders, three South Africans, four Poles, two Norwegians, one Frenchman and a Greek.The
Swiss government then reported the killings to the British government, including three additional victims, bringing the total number of those murdered to 50. Churchill was incensed, and even amid the final push for
victory made finding the killers a priority. ‘His
Majesty’s Government must record their solemn protest against these cold-blooded acts of butchery,’ Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden told Parliament. ‘They will
never cease in their efforts to collect the evidence to identify all those responsible… When the war is over, they will be brought to exemplary justice.’In
August 1945, three months after the Allied victory in Europe, the man to mastermind the hunt for the killers was found. Tall and lean, Frank McKenna had been a detective-sergeant in Blackpool, where his dedication
had earned him the nickname ‘Sherlock Holmes’. Escape route: A reconstruction of 'Harry' from the tunnel entrance point at the Stalag Luft III Prisoner of War Camp in Zagan, PolandHe could have spent a relatively safe war in the police, but instead joined the RAF and volunteered to join a bomber aircrew, flying on 30 missions. He subsequently secured a posting with the Special Investigation Branch (SIB) of the RAF Police, where Group Captain WV Nicholas, the head of SIB, quickly came to admire McKenna’s puritanical work ethic. When the Sagan case file hit his desk, Nicholas knew who to send it to.In McKenna’s view, the odds of conducting a successful investigation were daunting but not impossible. His plan was to comb the files of regional war-crimes record offices in the hope of establishing leads. Despite the obstacles and the sheer numbers involved, McKenna believed the investigation would last several months at most. It was an optimistic assessment.Joining McKenna in the hunt for those responsible for the 50 murders was Wing Commander Wilfred ‘Freddie’ Bowes, chief of the Special Investigation Branch, British forces, Occupied Germany. Powerfully built, he had served in the RAF since 1918, the year it was founded, and didn’t suffer fools gladly.Their investigation saw them criss-crossing the rubble-strewn landscape of post-war Germany and Europe. Each murder case proved to have its own challenges, as they pursued every clue in the search for justice.In February 1946, Bowes left for Czechoslovakia to pursue a lead in the murders of Squadron Leader Tom Kirby-Green and Canadian Flying Officer Gordon Kidder. The two airmen had got as far as southern Moravia in their attempt to reach Hungary before they were murdered. Now, a prisoner called Friedrich Kiowsky had implicated Gestapo officer Erich Zacharias in the killing.Two years earlier, while working as a driver for the Frontier Police in Zl�n, Kiowsky had seen Zacharias take part in the killing of the two Allied prisoners. The handcuffs were taken off the dead men, and everyone present was given the strictest instructions to discuss what had happened with no one.A Gestapo lawyer later helped witnesses orchestrate their alibis should the International Red Cross launch an investigation. They were to say the two fliers had tried to escape while relieving themselves and were shot at a distance of 20 to 30 metres.Bowes wanted to see the actual crime scene for himself, so he and a member of his team travelled by jeep until Kiowsky told them to stop. Bowes pulled the jeep over and surveyed the landscape: open country, with no possible cover for anyone attempting to escape. Johannes Post at his trial, at the moment the death sentence was passed
A few weeks later, McKenna arrived in the American-held port of Bremen. Records showed that a German national by the name of Erich Zacharias worked as a clerk at the U.S. Army Refrigeration Plant at the docks. McKenna arranged a U.S. Army military police escort, and that afternoon descended on the docks, where he spotted Zacharias standing outside the refrigeration plant. He was taken under armed guard to an American-run prison while McKenna sought permission to transfer him to British control. In the interim, however, Zacharias managed to escape, running off and disappearing into the nearby wreckage of a bombed-out building. Weeks later investigators intercepted a letter addressed to a friend of his and sent American soldiers to storm the return address – a house in Brunswick – where they found the fugitive Zacharias packing for a long trip.McKenna took Zacharias into custody and placed him in a British holding facility in Minden. A strip search revealed a wristwatch of the kind worn by British aircrews. Zacharias made no attempt to assert his innocence. On April 5, 1946, McKenna then escorted Zacharias to the London Cage: three large white mansions in Kensington Palace Gardens operated by MI19, the branch of the War Office charged with the interrogation of captured enemy personnel.Lieutenant Colonel AP Scotland oversaw the facility’s operation. When Scotland received Zacharias at the London Cage, the Gestapo man struck him as being ‘a wild young brute’. McKenna warned the colonel that his new inmate had a penchant for escaping, but Scotland dismissed McKenna’s concerns. Too short: Richard Attenborough and Steve McQueen in iconic film The Great Escape. 76 PoWs made it out through 'Harry' but the tunnel fell 30 yards short of vital woodland cover
Zacharias was soon transferred to a holding facility at Kempton Park Racecourse in Middlesex. But on the night of May 13, he took his tin dinner plate and began scratching away at the wood surrounding the lock on his cell door, eventually scraping away enough to release the mechanism and escape for a second time. Officials sounded a national alarm, while the BBC broadcast news of the escape, warning that Zacharias, ‘a Nazi police officer’, was extremely dangerous. He was not at large for long, for later that morning a member of the public spotted a man hiding in a local park. Zacharias was discovered beneath a bush, nursing a sprained ankle. By May 1947, the investigation appeared to be winding down. The RAF had tracked down 329 suspects, 23 of whom were directly complicit in the Sagan murders. Two of those individuals were dead by their own hand, and one – Kiowsky – was in Czech custody.Soon afterwards, the commandant of the holding facility in Minden called McKenna to say that the North West Europe War Crimes Unit had just brought in a man working as a haulage contractor. The man’s name was Johannes Pohlmann, but he had been identified by a witness as former Gestapo officer Johannes Post. McKenna went to see the prisoner, and pulled from his tunic a picture of Post. The face was thinner – but the eyes and prominent chin left no doubt in his mind.His cover blown, Post freely admitted to knowing all about the murders of Catanach, Christensen, Espelid and Fuglesang, adding with apparent pride that he was in command of the execution squad. He even admitted that the last word Catanach had uttered was ‘Why?’On July 1, 1947, 18 defendants in the Sagan case went on trial at the British Military Court in Hamburg charged with committing war crimes by killing and ordering to kill prisoners of war who had escaped from Stalag Luft III. All the defendants pleaded not guilty.The defence argued that orders issued by Hitler were legal; disobeying them was not. International law, however, deemed the following of such orders to be illegal, and on September 3, 1947, the court rendered its verdicts. All were found guilty.Post, Zacharias and 12 others were sentenced to hang. Six months later, on gallows built by the British Army’s Royal Engineers, the 14 Sagan murderers went to their deaths at the end of a rope, bringing to an end one of the most extraordinary manhunts of the 20th century.‘Human Game: Hunting the Great Escape Murderers’ by Simon Read is published by Constable & Robinson, �18.99.

'Half black, half white and almost everything it does stinks': Racism row erupts as Tea Party calls Barack Obama a skunkPresident admits fixing economy is 'long-term project' that will take more than one term to fixSays unemployment rate could fall to 8% before election

An ultra-conservative 'Tea Party' group has defended its depiction of President Barack Obama as a skunk as satirical - after it was accused of being racist.The Kansas-based Patriot Freedom Alliance came under fire for posting a photo of a skunk on its website.The caption above it read: 'The skunk has replaced the eagle as the new symbol for the president. It is half black, it is half white, and almost everything it does, stinks.' Offensive: The Tea Party branch posted this on its own website
On with the show: President Barack Obama meets with Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the White House in Washington
Area president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) Darrell Pope called the depiction a 'blatant statement of racism'.He said: 'As far as I'm concerned it's proof of the kind of organisation that they are, which I felt it always had racial overtones in the first place. More...
Stars come out for Christmas in Washington as Obama family join Justin Bieber, Jennifer Hudson and Conan O'Brien to sing carols
'You would think that an organisation that claims to be about patriotism and what this country is supposed to stand for would have a better way of expressing it than what they're doing.'Thomas Hymer, who maintains the website, defended the post which has now been taken down by saying: 'It's satire is what it is. Satire in a politically incorrect form.' Post: The image of the skunk, and the offending caption, have since been removed from the Patriot Freedom Alliance's website
And local tea party supporter Chuck Sankey said former U.S. vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin had been the target of worse insults.He told the Hutchinson News: 'It just makes a point that we're in trouble and what's happening doesn't smell right. That's what it means to me.'Asked about the note to half-black, half-white, seen as a reference to Obama's dual heritage of having a black father and white mother, he said: 'Isn't that the truth? 'What's wrong with the truth?' Appearance: Barack Obama spoke on CBS's 60 Minutes showUNEMPLOYMENT COULD FALL TO 8% BY ELECTIONPresident Barack Obama said the U.S. unemployment rate could fall to 8 per cent before he faces re-election next November.The rate, currently at 8.6 percent, has not been at or below 8 per cent since he took office in January 2009 amid a global economic crisis.In the 60 Minutes interview he was asked specifically whether he would get the rate back down to 8 percent before November's general election.He said: 'I think it's possible. But ... I'm not in the job of prognosticating on the economy. 'I'm in the job of putting in place the tools that allow the economy to thrive and Americans to succeed.'In the interview, he likened himself to a sea captain guiding a ship through a bad storm. So long as the boat is rocking and people are getting sick, he said, people will blame the captain.He added: 'People are going say, `You know what? A good captain would have had us in some smooth waters and sunny skies, at this point.'And I don't control the weather. What I can control are the policies we're putting in place to make a difference in people's lives.'
The Patriot Freedom Alliance meets regularly and has hosted rallies in the Hutchinson Sports Arena.The race row came as Obama said he 'always believed fixing the economy was a long-term project' during a wide-ranging interview on last night's 60 Minutes show on CBS.He acknowledged it would take more than one term in office for his administration to achieve what it set out in his hope-and-change campaign in 2008.He also blamed 'Republican intransigence' for stymieing his efforts to enact policies to improve the economy.He said he knew that 'reversing a culture here in Washington dominated by special interests would take more than year, more than two years, more than one term, probably take more than one president.'But he vowed not to bow out after a single term and added: 'One thing I pride myself on before becoming president and that has continued as president: I’m a persistent son of a gun. I stay at it. I keep staying at it.'Speaking about his potential 2012 opponents, he said former House speaker Newt Gingrich was 'good on TV and good in debates'. He also said former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney was 'good at politics'. But he asked voters to judge him against the alternative, and not against the ideal.He added: 'I’m being judged against the ideal... don’t judge me against the Almighty, judge me against the alternative.'

Has Tamra Barney had a tummy tuck? Real Housewives star shows signs of surgery on bikini break

She has spoken out about having breast surgery three times and admitted she needs to wean herself off the Botox she has been getting for years.But it looks like Tamra Barney may have gone under the knife once again, although wasn’t quite so forthcoming about it this time.The Real Housewives Of Orange County star was spotted frolicking in a bikini while on Miami Beach in Florida on Wednesday. Telling tummy: As she hit Miami Beach on Wednesday, Tamra Judge's belly button looked a lot different to how it did back in 2009, sparking rumours she has had a tummy tuck
And as she showed off a somewhat unnatural looking belly button, it sparked rumours that Tamra could have had a tummy tuck.The 46-year-old’s belly button was looking much tighter than in previous years, which is a sign of surgery on the stomach.But the mother-of-four wasn’t shy about showing off her figure as she took a dip in the sea in a mismatched two-piece. Fun in the sun: The Real Housewives Of Orange County star frolicked in the surf in a mismatched bikini
Close knit: The reality star was joined by her new husband Eddie Judge and her three youngest children
Tamra wore a black halterneck bandeau top with frilly peach coloured bottoms, topping off her beach look with a straw trilby and sunglasses.When she wasn’t splashing around in the surf, Tamra slipped on a baggy white top with black cross motif, and black hotpants.The reality star is currently holidaying with her three youngest children and her new husband Eddie Judge. Up top: Eddie clearly has a strong relationship with his new stepchildren as they goofed around on the beach
Funnyface: The 46-year-old showed she is young at heart as she stuck her tongue out playfully
The happy couple married in June in a lavish ceremony at St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort in Laguna Beach, Orange County.And Eddie, who stood out in bright green swimming trunks, showed he clearly has a close bond with his stepchildren as they goofed around on the sand.Tamra is mother to an adult son, Ryan Vieth, from her first marriage, and younger children Sidney, Spencer, and Sophia from her failed ten-year marriage to Simon Barney.Tamra has previously revealed that she regretted getting DD implants and replaced them with C-cups in 2007. Let's play: Tamra's son Spencer gave her a gentle push towards the water during the fun-filled day out
Beachy keen: The blonde mother-of-four later slipped a baggy top and hotpants over her two-piece
But a few years later the blonde had those removed and is now a size 34B.She has written on her blog of the decision: ‘I had them removed for several reasons, 1. I live a more active lifestyle now (working out and running) and they really got in the way. 2. I feel at 44 I am finally comfortable in my own skin and I don’t need big ta-ta’s to make me look better.‘3. One of the biggest reasons, I had a scare with breast cancer and I thought it would be better to just have them removed.’Tamra has been appearing on The Real Housewives of Orange County, the first program in the franchise, since the third season. Easy to spot: Tamra would have had no problem finding Eddie in a crowd in his bright green swimming trunks
Now and then: Botox fan Tamra loves to share bikini clad shots of herself, and is pictured left in a photo from February and right in a vintage snap

I agree she looked better before the tummy tuck. I have stretch marks and have never been pregnant. I would kill for my stomach to look like her before. She hardly had any stretch marks!

She looks better in the pic on the right before surgery. Her stomach looks odd now and especially her belly button, well ... her belly slit.
