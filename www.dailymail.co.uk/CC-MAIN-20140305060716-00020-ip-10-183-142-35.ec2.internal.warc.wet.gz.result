It's often said that you can't see London in a day. Well, now you can.Using 48,000 individual frames, photographers have created the world's largest panoramic image, allowing you to explore England's capital like never before.Taken from the top of the BT Tower, London's tenth largest building, the interactive picture offers a 360-degree view that lets you weave through the architectural maelstrom and even occasionally stumble upon some greenery. London in 320-Gigapixels - use your mouse to navigate around London (may not work on all mobile devices) Bird's eye view: An overview of the 360-degree image that consists of 320 billion pixels
LONDON'S 360 IN NUMBERS3 – the number of days it took to shoot all the individual photos3 – the number of months over which the computer processed the final result60,000 – times bigger than an iPhone 4 photo98 – length in metres if printed in normal photographic resolution24 – height in metres if printed in normal photographic resolution29th – The floor at the BT Tower where the photos were taken20 – number of miles distant to the viewable horizon
Whether zooming in on the Shard,
or picking up a group of friends playing football in the park, the picture offers an immediate taste of life in the city.Photographers spent three days painstakingly capturing the city while enduring sub-zero temperatures, making sure that every inch was covered.The 320 gigapixel image (320 billion pixels) took a further three months to finalise, as technicians from photography firm 360Cities amalgamated the images and welded them into a final vista.

The completed interactive image - 64,000 times more detailed than a standard iPhone snap - would measure 98 metres in width and 24 metres in height if printed in 2D.The nearest attempt at creating a similar image was in 2010, taken from Centrepoint. But the image was a quarter of the size, measuring 80 gigapixels.These new images, which were taken following the London 2012 Games, capture the city during a remarkable year in which it hosted the world's biggest sporting occasion, saw patriotic fervor swell due to the Queen's jubilee and welcomed Europe's largest building to its skyline. Vista: A trio of photographers from company 360Cities spent three days in 2012 compiling the images using four cameras
Detail: The photographers meticulously gathered the images from every angle possible in order to create the image
Hard work: The trio were forced to endure sub-zero temperatures and 50mph gusts of wind to complete the project
Toil: After the pictures were taken the team spent another three months amalgamating them into a final piece
The image was taken from the BT Tower's 29th floor - with the horizon 20 miles in the distance.Suzi Williams from BT, who sponsored the picture, said: 'What better way to capture that remarkable year than with a full panoramic photograph taken from its roof. This isn’t just a world record for the BT Tower, it’s for London and the people who live, work in or visit the capital.'The interactive map invites Londoners, or indeed anybody with a soft spot for the capital, to mark their favourite views or places on it.The director of 360Cities described how his photography team of Jeffrey Martin, Tom Mills and Holger Schulze had to battle the elements to capture the image. Deatil: The interactive picture allows you to zoom in incredible detail, whether it is looking at the Shard or perhaps recognising yourself walking along the street Sightseeing: The in-depth zoom function allows to explore London's landmarks, such as Tower Bridge
Hi there: Passengers on the London Eye, another of London's impressive viewpoints
The trio had to endure below freezing conditions and were battered by gusts of winds of up to 50mph.Steve Hercher said: 'So many unknowns and variables had to be
addressed in the planning of this unprecedented shoot, really the first
of its kind. 'Software and hardware were pushed to the limits, and rain,
wind and other potential stumbling blocks had to be dealt with.'Our photography team of Jeffrey Martin, Tom Mills and Holger Schulze did an amazing job and not a single individual frame from the more than 48,000 planned was missed.' Stunning: The incredible interactive image of London comprises more than 48,000 individual frames amalgamated Have a look: The image allows users to span the capital as captured from the 29th floor of the BT Tower, London's tenth largest buildingThe team used four Canon EOS 7D cameras to record the 48,640 images. They were mounted on Clauss company Rodeon VR Head ST robotic panorama heads and positioned in four secure locations around the platform. The robotic heads are capable of 72,000 steps in a single 360 degree arc and the cameras here were set to fire four frames a second. Laptops monitored a live preview of the images.The team behind the photo have also hidden a BT mascot in the image, with prizes up for grabs for those who find him. Operation: The detailed operation captured at height as the photographers captured the images and reviewed them them live as they were fed into nearby computers

Here to stay! Januzaj handed five-year deal as United aim to tie down sought-after teen

Manchester United are on the brink of sealing a new, five-year deal that will tie young starlet Adnan Januzaj to the club until 2018. The 18-year-old Belgian’s current deal is set to expire at the end of this season and Januzaj had been attracting the attention of Juventus, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. New United manager David Moyes has been impressed by the talent and maturity of Januzaj and he has ensured that the club have acted quickly to keep the forward at Old Trafford. Talented: Manchester United are preparing to keep Januzaj for the long-haul with a five-year contract
Januzaj is already one of the highest earning youngsters at Old Trafford and Sportsmail understands that United are putting the finishing touches to a new deal that will recognise the emergence of Januzaj as United’s most exciting young talent after an impressive pre-season under new manager David Moyes. Januzaj, along with fellow youngster Jesse Lingard, was one of the shining lights on United’s tour of Asia and Australia and the young Belgian dazzled Old Trafford with his quick feet and powerful shot during Rio Ferdinand’s testimonial against Sevilla earlier this month.Although Januzaj appears to be on the verge of breaking into the United first-team - he also appeared in the Community Shield win over Wigan - Sportsmail understands that it is United’s preference to allow the player to leave on loan this season to continue his development. First team action: David Moyes has been impressed by the youngster, just as Sir Alex Ferguson was
Academy stars: Jesse Lingard is another highly rated player at United, appearing on their pre-season tour
There is a desire at United to see Januzaj in the Premier League but a loan move to elsewhere in the top-flight will only be granted if the forward is offered guarantees of regular, first-team football. The likelihood is therefore that Januzaj will spend this season at a leading Championship club. Sir Alex Ferguson was an admirer of the Belgian and Januzaj was handed a place on the substitute’s bench for the former manager’s final game in charge of Manchester United at West Brom in May. Ferguson said: ‘Adnan is a beautifully balanced player. He’s only 18 and still to grow into his frame. But he has good balance, good acceleration and he’s a very good technical player.’ Experience needed: Meanwhile, Nick Powell could be sent on loan
Meanwhile, another of United’s brightest young prospects, Nick Powell, will be allowed to leave the club on loan this season. Powell missed United’s pre-season through injury and although Sir Alex Ferguson intended to push Powell towards the first-team this season, it is understood that David Moyes intends to loan Powell out, with Wigan registering an interest in the former Crewe man. The player’s long term future, though, is very much seen to be at Old Trafford. More...
