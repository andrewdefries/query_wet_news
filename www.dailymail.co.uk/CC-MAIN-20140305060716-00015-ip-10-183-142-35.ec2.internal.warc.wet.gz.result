Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe is talking about plans to make all coppers wear cameras to prove they're not bent
Believe me, I had no intention of writing about the police today. If I never had to mention the Old Bill again, that would suit me just fine.When I was a young reporter, the only time you used to hear from Plod was when they were appealing for witnesses or giving an impromptu Press conference outside the Old Bailey at the end of a major trial.These days there’s no hiding place. Take yesterday, for instance. Turn on the television news and there’s the Home Secretary insisting that the police will have to sign up to a code of ethics promising to ‘respect and obey the law at all times’.Switch on the wireless and the Met Commissioner Bernard Hyphen-Howe is talking about plans to make all coppers wear cameras to prove they’re not bent.I couldn’t help laughing. Jim Davidson used to do a comedy routine about bobbies on the beat wearing flashing blue lights on their hats. Now Britain’s ‘top cop’ has gone one better, intending to equip all his officers with their own helmet-mounted personal CCTVs.Nick, nick!Open the papers and read about the appearance of assorted policemen before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee in connection with the ‘Plebgate’ scandal.What a desperately unimpressive bunch. Take away the chief constables’ uniforms and they could have been just another bunch of dissembling NHS bureaucrats or BBC ‘human resources’ suits attempting, and failing, to deflect criticism of their spectacular incompetence.But the chiefs looked like paragons of probity alongside the Indians — those three Police Federation shop stewards who lied through their teeth in an attempt to smear the former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell. The committee chairman Keith Vaz told them their evidence was ‘most unsatisfactory’ and reminded them that lying to Parliament was an offence.

The Inspector's mouth was set as hard as a death mask
Even though their version of events was completely contradicted by a recording of their meeting with Mitchell, they are still refusing to apologise to him. Meanwhile, the investigation into the officers who fitted him up is still rumbling on after more than a year. How much longer is it going to take?A couple of people have been charged, but no one has been disciplined, sacked or taken to court. There are serious doubts as to whether any officer involved will ever be brought to justice.It’s not often the Mellorphant Man and I agree on anything. But he was bang on when he said ‘Plebgate’ should be the end of Hyphen-Howe’s brief but undistinguished career at Scotland Yard.As I wrote a few weeks ago, the Met is trying to pin criminal charges on newspaper group directors whose reporters are accused of phone hacking. Andrew Mitchell should have been reinstated to the Cabinet months ago, after Channel 4 obtained film of what really went on Downing Street that night. So why hasn't he been?
So, in the still-not-certain event of a few coppers ever appearing at the Bailey over the conspiracy to destroy Mitchell, why shouldn’t Hyphen-Howe be put in the dock alongside them?Especially as — in clear contravention of his own draconian rules on contacts between the police and Press — he personally briefed reporters in support of his officers before the full facts were known.Mitchell should have been reinstated to the Cabinet months ago, after Channel 4 obtained film of what really went on Downing Street that night. So why hasn’t he been?It is still disputed whether or not he used the word ‘plebs’. He denies it.But the buzz from Westminster is that there remains concern over him telling the cops who tried to stop him taking his push-bike through the main gate: ‘I thought you guys were supposed to effin help us.’ Except he used a stronger expletive than ‘effin’. It might have been un-parliamentary language, but plenty of people would share his sentiment.Even those who dismiss ‘Plebgate’ as a demeaning and distant squabble between police and politicians think Plod has lost the plot.That includes legions of retired and still-serving officers who write to me in despair at what the Job has become. Home Secretary Theresa May has insisted that the police sign up to a code of ethics promising to 'respect and obey the law at all times'
Belatedly, the Home Secretary has woken up to the glaring realisation that the police no longer enjoy the confidence of the decent people of Middle Britain whom they are paid to serve and protect.Is it any wonder? Take the case of Ingrid Loyau-Kennett. You may remember the name. She was the celebrated ‘Angel of Woolwich’ who confronted the men alleged to have murdered Drummer Lee Rigby in South-East London.Miss Loyau-Kennett, a teacher and former Girl Guides leader, lives on an estate in Helston, Cornwall, where she has been the target of a local gang which has repeatedly thrown eggs and stones at her house. Recently she caught some boys in the act and called the police. I’ll let her take up the story...‘They arrived after 20 minutes which was useless as by the time they got here, the kids had left. The police were saying that I should stop ringing them and that I had no proof. One of the policemen grabbed my arm really tight and twisted it. He told me that if I didn’t calm down I would be arrested.‘They made me out to be the wrongdoer — he just wouldn’t understand my side of the story and that I was actually the victim.’Sounds about right. How many times have we read similar stories about the Old Bill ignoring the original crime and threatening to nick the innocent victim instead?Back in August, I brought you the case of 57-year-old grandmother Elaine Perry, who called the police after she was threatened in the street.Her ordeal began when she remonstrated with parents whose children were constantly sounding a car horn. Miss Perry, a librarian, was threatened by the children’s mother, who has a string of convictions for everything from assault to affray.But when the bold Plod arrived, they decided bizarrely to arrest Miss Perry, who had never been in trouble before. She was put in a ‘spit hood’, her legs were taped together and she was bundled into the back of a van in front of a crowd of jeering onlookers.When she appeared in court, accused of threatening behaviour and assault, magistrates had no hesitation in throwing out the charges. What kind of copper would subject a 57-year-old grandmother to such brutal treatment? Look no further than the Twitter account of one of the officers involved, a dopey WPC called Katrina Saunders. If someone had told you ten years ago that coppers would have to wear cameras on their heads to prove they weren't fitting people up, would you have believed them?
In response to news about the introduction of tasers, she wrote: ‘Yeaaaah taser taser taser!!! :-)’ We’re not talking George Dixon here, are we?Both Miss Perry and Miss Loyau-Kennett would undoubtedly agree with Andrew Mitchell. They, too, grew up believing the police were there to ‘effin help us’.Look, I accept that there are thousands of coppers doing the right thing every day. I’ve consistently praised and supported those officers who put their lives on the line, especially those involved in fighting terrorists and hardened criminals.But there is a significant minority of policemen and women who hold the paying public in contempt and believe they are our masters, not our servants.Plenty of them think they are above the law, too. Would you trust that dead-eyed inspector from the Police Federation who appeared before the Commons this week to do the right thing?Me neither. Something has gone horribly wrong with Her Majesty’s Constabulary. If someone had told you ten years ago that coppers would have to wear cameras on their heads to prove they weren’t fitting people up, would you have believed them?Or that a Conservative Home Secretary would demand that police officers sign a code of ethics promising to ‘respect and obey the law at all times’. Isn’t that why they joined in the first place?And that, I promise, is the last word I’m ever going to write about the police. Until the next time.Mind how you go. Let’s agree that the energy firms are robbing us blind and we should never have sold our gas and electricity industries to foreigners.This week John Major has demanded a windfall tax on the profits of the big suppliers. Our fuel bills would be ten per cent cheaper if Ed Miliband hadn't committed us to lunatic 'carbon reduction' targets when he was Labour's Energy Secretary
In so doing, he has given succour to the shameless opportunist Ed Miliband, who cynically promises to freeze bills for two years. Of course, our fuel bills would be ten per cent cheaper if Miliband hadn’t committed us to lunatic ‘carbon reduction’ targets when he was Labour’s Energy Secretary. His ‘green energy’ levies will soon cost every household an extra �200 a year. Forget Major’s windfall tax, we should scrap Miliband’s windmills tax. Ready, Steady, Cook the booksLast week I pointed out the resemblance between George Osborne and the young Robert Maxwell. Paul Drury has sent me this poster which he spotted in a supermarket in Glasgow. How long, Paul wonders, has Boy George been moonlighting as a chef in Morrisons? Paul Drury has sent Richard this poster which he spotted in a supermarket in Glasgow. How long, Paul wonders, has Boy George been moonlighting as a chef in Morrisons?
A team of crack Romanian policemen has been seconded to London to help combat a crime wave by Romanian gangsters.I know this is going to sound controversial and perhaps the teensiest bit ‘racist’, but wouldn’t it have been a better idea to stop the Romanian gangsters coming here in the first place? German Chancellor Angela Merkel complains that the U.S. government has been hacking her mobile phone. Just as well Met Commissioner Bernard Hyphen-Howe isn’t in charge of the Washington Police Department.Otherwise he’d have raided the White House at 6am, arrested President Obama, and searched his daughters’ knicker drawers for ‘evidence’.

Kim Kardashian has been likened to Marilyn Monroe by Carine Roitfeld.The former French Vogue editor, who now edits her own title, CR Fashion Book, explained why she cast the newly-engaged reality star, 33, in her latest issue.Ms Roitfeld told Time Out London: 'She’s controversial, but so was Marilyn
Monroe and I always like controversial people.' A modern Marilyn Monroe? Kim Kardashian has been likened to the late icon by Carine Roitfeld, who featured her on the cover of her magazine CR Fashion Book
Dividing opinion: Monroe, pictured in 1953. The former French Vogue editor said of Ms Kardashian: 'She's controversial, but so was Marilyn Monroe and I always like controversial people'
The photo shoot saw the heavily-pregnant Kardashian pose for Karl Lagerfeld back in May, in a shoot art-directed by Riccardo Tisci. She was seen wearing a grill on the magazine cover, while inside shots showed her with jam smeared across her mouth and an embellished mask over her face. More...
They're engaged! Kanye West proposes to Kim Kardashian on her birthday with a huge 15-carat diamond ring... and he rents out ENTIRE baseball park to pop the question
Out with the old and in with the new! How does Kim Kardashian's 15-carat sparkler from Kanye West size up to the 20-carat bling she received from ex-Kris Humphries?
Another image shows her in a black veil and a Yankees cap, while a further frame shows her baring her seven-months-pregnant belly with pride. Tastemaker: Ms Roitfeld, pictured at the Met Gala in May, says Ms Kardashian's beauty is a 'talent'
'She was brave. . . with Karl Lagerfeld shooting,' Ms Roitfeld continued. 'She had one guy for hair, one guy for make-up – no extensions or lashes – and for her it must have been like being naked, and she accepted everything.'I
don’t think normally she would wear those sort of clothes – I’ve never seen her in a Comme des Garcons jumpsuit or a basketball jacket, but she
said yes to everything. She was the easiest model we’ve had. And when we put a mask on her face, she didn’t say anything.'Ms Roitfeld added that she considers Ms Kardashian's beauty a 'talent' and also praised her work ethic.'She’s beautiful – and in fashion, that is a talent you know,' she said. 'She was also a very sweet person, a hard worker. You don’t see her
in parties drinking loads of alcohol.'Ms Kardashian, who got engaged to boyfriend Kanye West in an elaborate proposal last night, features in the third issue of CR Fashion Book.Roitfeld told WWD that the image was a 'precious moment of Kim’s pregnancy that people haven’t seen.' And, she insists, her feature on Ms Kardashian is a far cry from the weekly magazines that charted every stage of her pregnancy.

'This is not something for a gossip magazine that goes into the trash. This is a magazine that is a collector’s item,' she said.'I hope the issue will be
a good souvenir for her and her baby,' she added to Time Out.The new issue of CR Fashion Book is on newsstands now.

No wonder Vogue fired Ms Roitfeld - she always was a joke. You only have to look at the way she dresses to see that. She is as ridiculous as Kim Kardashian herself and nothing in this new magazine of hers surprises me at all. 1

What is going on - story after story is about this family - I've never even seen their programme and I'm sure that a lot of other people reading this paper have never seen it either - please please please can't you shut up about them - most of us are sick of even seeing the Kardashian name - never mind reading the stories. It's so boring, boring, boring and they don't have anything in their lives that most people want to know about - so why do you inflict them on us day after day?

Three things That Kardashian thing doesn't have that Munro did. Talent, looks and a personality.
Carine Roitfeld you need to get your head tested or at least pay a visit to Specsavers.
Either way you need help for even thinking This over paid piece of trash is even close to Monroe.

Don't you just love how enthusiastic they are about their HATE! - WeAreSoDoomed, USA, 1/8/2012 13:12+++++++++++++ What about the hate you are showing. It works both ways.
- Lilly, USA, 2/8/2012 15:48................ Lilly I was wondering where you see the hate from the first statement,also you are saying that one side is actually showing hate as you say it works both ways. In other words those that you support (your words not mine) do hate so assume the other side hates from a post that does no such thing,apart from your imagination. Yes she was obviously being sarcastic (no humour allowed?) but no hate,unless you´re reading the posters mind in someway?
