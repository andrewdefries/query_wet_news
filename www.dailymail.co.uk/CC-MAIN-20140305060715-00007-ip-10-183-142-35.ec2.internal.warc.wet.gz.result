This is kind of silly to get rid of a huge building that covers an entire city block it seems, when we are constantly told there is no money to be had to help people, like the victims of Super Storm Sandy.

PREMIER LEAGUE LIVE: The New Year's Day action from around the grounds as it happened

Matt1986, Kent, 01/01/2013 16:38 At least try concentrating on Man Utd when they're playing. Or was the game effectively over by 16:38? Well that's because the referee denied Wigan a perfectly onside goal which would made it 1-2 and swinged the momentum their way. And there's me thinking Clattenburg, Halsey and Webb was enough for Man Utd.
