New York newspaper removes map of handgun owners three days after state passes gun control legislation

Comment:
I've no idea why the interactive map was printed in the first place, but do think it's hilarious that the news weenies rushed out and hired guards, armed with guns, to keep them 'safe' from possible consequences of their own actions. Well, a free press demands responsible reportage, and the printing of the interactive map was not, in my opinion, the least bit responsible, just a way of using the Newtown incident for financial gain, which is disgusting.
