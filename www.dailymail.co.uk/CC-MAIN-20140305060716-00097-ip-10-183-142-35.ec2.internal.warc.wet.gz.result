Were I to tell you that I started my current relationship just six months after my husband died, would you judge me? You wouldn't be alone. The matter of how soon is too soon to move on after being widowed is a highly controversial one. But I don't feel guilty because I know my late husband would be glad for me. Tragic: Jayne with Neil on their wedding day in 2004, six years before his death
In fact, when I met my current partner, Adam, the last thing in the world I wanted or expected was a new relationship. But we are proof that you simply cannot plan life - or choose who you fall in love with, or when. When happiness came my way, I chose to grasp it with both hands. I have no regrets in doing so, even though I know people may criticise me for it. More...

Of course, I could never have imagined my life would pan out like this. I was 18 and at sixth-form college when I met Neil, the man who would become my husband. He was also 18, and I'd always thought we would grow old and grey together.I'd had boyfriends before, but Neil was different: he was that rare mix of gentle, funny, clever and kind. Our relationship flourished, despite the fact that over the next three years we attended universities miles apart. Neil studied criminology in Lincoln and I did nursing in Harrogate. Wedded bliss: Jayne celebrating her nuptials with late husband Neil
We married in July 2004, after graduating, and moved into a new two-bedroom terrace house near Colne, Lancashire. Our two children soon followed: Alexander, now seven, then Amy, five. Neil was now a police officer, and I worked part-time as a nurse, so I had time at home with the children. Neil was caring, protective and, best of all, a real family man. If life wasn't perfect, it was as happy as I could possibly have imagined it.That's until one Friday night in April 2010, when Neil went to a friend's stag party in Newcastle. I was going out too that night and my parents were babysitting, so I dropped the children off with them and drove home to get ready.I'd only just arrived home when my father turned up and said Amy wouldn't settle. 'Will you come back with me and give her a cuddle?' he asked.'My fit, healthy, gorgeous husband, who was only 30, had walked into a pub and collapsed before he had even had a drink.'
I thought it was strange that Dad hadn't just phoned me. It was only later that I realised he had something terrible to tell me, and wanted me to be safe with him and Mum and the children when he did so. As we pulled into my parents' drive, Dad turned to me and said: 'It's Neil.' I saw two police officers through the window in my parents' front room and my stomach lurched. Dad and I rushed into the house and I sat, flanked by my parents, as the police confirmed Neil was dead. My fit, healthy, gorgeous husband, who was only 30, had walked into a pub and collapsed before he had even had a drink. His friends - many of them fellow police officers - had desperately tried to revive him and called an ambulance, but he had died within minutes of collapsing. Neil's heart had simply and inexplicably stopped beating. A post-mortem examination later classed the cause of death as Sudden Adult Death Syndrome - a fatal disturbance in the heart's rhythm, which can strike at any age, and which can affect even fit and healthy people. Jayne and late husband Neil and baby Alexander on a day out in the summer of 2006
My first fear was that Neil might have suffered. Then I just felt numb. We all sat there crying, in disbelief and shock.It took two days to summon the courage to tell the children Daddy wasn't coming home. They had thought he was away for the weekend, so that bought me the extra time. I sat them down in the living room, but as I tried to utter the words, I broke down. My mum had to take over. Amy was too young to understand. Alexander - who idolised his dad - fell silent. I don't think he properly comprehended either - how could he? - because he kept asking when Dad was coming back. For three weeks, we stayed with my parents. Consumed by grief, I found my only solace in sleeping pills prescribed by the doctor. Even the funeral two weeks later was a blur. Jayne and Neil with their son Alexander and daughter Amy a year before Neil passed away
When I finally mustered the courage to take the children back to our home, it felt cold and empty without Neil. His police uniform was still hanging in the wardrobe and his favourite football DVDs were next to the television. At every turn, I was reminded of how happy we had been, and of how much we'd been looking forward to our future together.A fortnight later, Neil's sergeant came to tell me Neil had passed his sergeant's exams with flying colours. It broke my heart to think my hard-working husband would never know of his success. Thankfully, my parents came over every day. They helped me care for the children and establish new routines, and that forced me to carry on when I thought I couldn't. Alexander was starting school that September in 2010 - a school Neil and I had carefully chosen together. This was the first milestone we would have to reach without my husband and even buying our son's uniform, knowing Neil would never see it, was incredibly upsetting.'Adam and I had met a few times before, so I arranged for him to come round and advise on the work that needed doing.'
The most difficult times, though, were at bedtime because Alexander would get upset that Daddy wasn't there to tuck him in. It was truly heartbreaking. Our house had been on the market since before Neil's death. In late September, an offer was made on it, which I felt I should accept because a fresh start would help.I managed to find a house down the road - two minutes from my parents - where I thought we could, eventually, be happy. It needed lots of work doing to it, but I thought this might provide a distraction from my grief and give me something to focus on other than my loss.My brother Christopher said his friend Adam, a 30-year-old builder, might be able to help me lick the new house into shape. Adam and I had met a few times before, so I arranged for him to come round and advise on the work that needed doing.That first time, there was no discernible spark – of course, that was the last thing on my mind. Adam knew of my loss and was considerate and professional, and his advice was very helpful. New love: Jayne and her fiance Adam
I moved in towards the end of September. A month later, I held a Halloween party for the sake of the children, and I invited Adam along with our friends. He was easy to talk to, and we seemed to have lots in common as we chatted in the kitchen that late afternoon. Not only had his mother worked with Neil's mum, but he'd known my brother for years through mutual friends. Again, I wouldn't say there was any chemistry as such - we just got on well. Two weeks later, Adam phoned and invited me out for dinner. I was surprised and hesitant. Was it too soon after losing Neil to go on a date? It was a dilemma, but in the end I decided to say yes, if only for a couple of hours away from being sad, in the company of someone who made me laugh. It did feel strange getting dressed up for a date after so many years. I pulled on a checked skirt with a purple top and felt very nervous. We went to an Italian restaurant and I was surprised that my awkwardness evaporated. And as we chatted, I noticed that I was warming to him; I found him attractive. Growing family: Jayne with Alexander, Amy and eleven month-old Maisy
There was no guilt, nor did I feel like I was betraying Neil. Adam is completely different and being with him felt completely different. We really hit it off that evening, and I felt I could trust Adam despite being vulnerable. We talked about friends we had in common and I spoke openly about my grief. When Adam dropped me home, he leant in to give me a gentle kiss goodbye and it felt completely natural. It was only when I thought about it the following morning that I found I was torn. Neil had only been gone seven months. I couldn't imagine how a man would fit into my life, which was all about my children, and of course I worried about getting hurt. But I saw Adam several times over the next few weeks while he worked on the house. I could grieve and cry in front of him. He didn't mind. I handled my twinges of guilt that it was too soon by reminding myself that Neil would not have wanted me to be alone. Somehow, I felt his presence, and sensed he was happy I had a supportive man like Adam in my life.I never stopped thinking about Neil, but I also felt someone like Adam might never come along again. I didn't want to lose him. We worried what other people would think, so we kept our relationship secret for the first month. Adam visited me in the evenings after the children had gone to bed. It seemed too soon to introduce a new man into their lives. I also didn't know how I would break the news to Neil's parents, who had been so supportive. Nobody could ever take Neil's place, but would they see it that way?Adam started to stay for the odd night. Amazingly, being intimate didn't feel wrong. I realised it was time for a new life.So I decided to introduce Adam to the children. 'When Adam kissed me for the first time it felt so natural - but in the morning I felt a pang of guilt'
He started coming over for tea and he was great with them, taking them to the park and the swimming pool and helping Alexander with his homework. They grew to think the world of him.One evening, I asked them how they would feel about Adam moving in. I was relieved when they started jumping excitedly on the bed. Having Adam round was like an adventure to them. Mum said she had guessed we were together but I was still afraid of telling Neil's parents. Thankfully, they took it well and assured me I was still young and deserved to be happy. Neil's mum has since confessed they worried they might lose touch with their grandchildren, but the children see them every week, and there is no awkwardness when Adam drops them off.Adam moved in with us in March 2011. I still occasionally worried when I had to explain to Neil's old friends that I'd met someone else. And there have been some awkward moments when people assume Alexander and Amy are Adam's children - and Alexander turns round and says: 'My daddy's in heaven.' But if people ever thought badly of us, they didn't say so. Six months after Adam moved in, we started trying for a baby. Happy family: Jayne with her partner Adam, son Alexander, and daughters Amy and Maisy
I know some people will say that was too soon as well - and again, I didn't find it easy telling Neil's parents or friends - but it felt right to us, and we thought a new baby would be a wonderful way to cement our relationship. We were prepared for the fact that it might take a year or two for me to get pregnant, so we were surprised and delighted when I conceived as soon as we started trying. Our daughter Maisy was born in July last year. She's created a special bond between all of us. Adam and I are getting married next May. I still grieve for Neil, and I always will - particularly on the children's birthdays. We have his framed photograph in our sitting room, and the children have their own albums of pictures of their father. Adam will never replace him, and he wouldn't want to, but he is a wonderful father figure to them.Some people might find it hard to understand how I could move on so quickly. But Neil's death proves that life is too short and I'm not ashamed of what has happened. At 33, I'm just thankful to have met two such wonderful men in one lifetime. I count my blessings every day.

You cant put a time limit on grief, However I find it strange that she could get romantically involved so soon after loosing her partner and father of her children. I have experienced grief and wouldn't have had the energy, time or inclination to think about a new romance. But each to their own and Im sure she had the children's needs in her thoughts also.

I am pleased that you have been lucky to find happiness a second time.The only thing I would say to you is make sure your children know their paternal Grandparents as it is easy for them to be pushed out at this time.

I think there's two ways of looking at this. 1) You've had a wonderful, loving relationship, why wouldn't you want to replicate that? It's a huge compliment to your husband. 2) If you love someone so much, you're never going to be able to replace them. Who are we to judge?

Why should anyone condemn you. Finding love again does not mean you forget your lost love. I know because it happened to me. Finding love again is not replacing something you lost. The lost love was then and my new love is now. I do not compare, it is not a competition to mark one against the other. True love is without compromise, you love completely without qualification and new and past love are a compliment to each to the other.

I commented on this article yesterday and i just wanted to point out that having read pretty much all of the comments here - those who are being judgemental, horrible and insensitive have NOT had this happen to them. They haven't the pain of losing their loved one and having to comprehend life without them. Mose of the lovely, respectful and well-wishing comments (thankfully the majority) come from those who have experienced this and understand what this poor woman went through....because you don't truly understand unless you have. I lost my partner 3 years ago tomorrow, and it still hurts every day, I still miss him....but if love came along, even after 6 months, it wouldn't mean that I didn't love him with all my heart. All of the people who have said 'well she can't really have loved her husband' - you have NO idea what you are talking about. 4

Think 6 months is WAY too soon for a widow (or widower) to fall in love again. I can never understand anyone being able to do that. Can't see how real love is SO easily replaced...this is a person, not a cd player you're on about! Other people I've talked to agree with my theory; you shouldn't automatically stay single forever if you've been widowed, but if you replace your "true love" TOO quickly, it's like having a "significant other" in your life is the real priority, not the person you've lost. People who've been callously dumped by a spouse often can't more on THAT quickly, and in that case I really would say "Good luck: show the creep you're over him/her", but I'd hate to leave someone widowed and find out they're planning they're next marriage within the year! Why are you wasting news room on anyone who's SO "co-dependent" and unable to function alone that they replace husbands and wives like possessions? Get a life! Fiona, Berkshire

Six months is too soon in my opinion. My dad died in December 1995 (yes, Christmas that year was the worst ever, obviously) - I would have totally hated it (and my mum?) if she'd found new love in June 1996. If she had fallen in love again after a more healthy interval - say, 3 years, I'm sure I'd have been okay with it - but six months! Takes me back to a problem I read in a teen mag of mine years ago "My mum died a year ago, I can't cope, and my dad already has a girlfriend". What is it with some married people that they get widowed and think "Help! I'm starting to suffer from empty bed syndrome! It's been three months, and there's this man/woman I fancy..." I hope if I ever marry, no one trivialises my memory in such a hurtful way. I'd say don't be alone forever (if you have a choice) - but I'd like to think a man could stay single for, say, 2 years before finding my equal again. 31

I think people grieve differently. Six months seems awfully soon especially considering it was such a shocking sudden death, but regardless, I'm glad she's not on her own and that she has found someone to be with again, nobody deserves to be alone and in the grand scheme of things it's really down to how comfortable the people involved are.

The �4,600-a-night hotel where Prince Albert is 'trying to persuade Charlene to stay in marriage'

Comment:
Rosie of Bristol - you are so right. For years she has been with this man and until very recently she seemed not only happy with him, but poised and confident. The bride of Saturday had had all that knocked out of her - her face was unable to conceal her feelings and he looked bad tempered and angry when she was crying. No doubt reflecting on the years spent with him when he may have been cheating on her. It's typical that Monaco sources would assume that luxury and a fabulous honeymoon would make all the difference. William and Kate???? Kate didn't have that kind of shadow hanging over her wedding! Even Charles and Diana, whose marriage was practically an arranged match - looked blissful as newlyweds in comparison. I have NEVER seen a more unhappy looking couple as I saw on the TV on Saturday in Monaco.

Multi-millionaire who lost his �1.8m home and had to move into a rented flat in 'disastrous' divorce is given reprieve by judges over 'too favourable' settlement to his wife

Comment:
She gets pregnant and then stays home to look after their children and they build a family together. Suddenly everything falls apart and she walks away with nothing after 34 years? What a foolish idea!
- Common Dog , Dorset, 30/10/2012 11:36
BUT its "her" body her decision no??? With that logic she should be held more responsible for "her" decision to have children so it shouldn't be 50/50 on that account no? Bet that doesn't sit right!

The men questioned in the study said animals 'just taste too good to not eat them' whereas women were more apologetic about eating meat. The study surveyed 125 undergraduate psychology students for one study, and 89 for the second.They were all white middle class students in their late teens and early 20s. Prof Rothberger found: 'Men expressed more favorable attitudes toward eating meat, denied animal suffering, believed that animals were lower in a hierarchy than humans, provided religious and health justifications for consuming animals, and believed that it was human destiny to eat meat.'
'These are direct, unapologetic strategies that embrace eating meat and justify the practice.'
While the professor admits his study was limited, he believes there could be even more pressure to 'prove manhood' by eating more meat.Whether it is hunting for animals, flipping the barbecue burgers or carving the Sunday Roast, past studies have shown the association between men and meat is as old as the hills. The men questionned in the study said animals 'just taste too good to not eat them' whereas women were more apologetic about eating meat
Researchers from the University of British Columbia revealed that vegetarian men are seen as wimps and less macho than those who like tucking into a steak – even by women who do not eat meat themselves. They gave hundreds of young men and women descriptions of fictional students varying only according to diet, and asked them to rate aspects of their personalities.The vegetarian characters were seen as being more virtuous.And further questioning revealed that men who do not eat meat were also viewed as less masculine than the others – even by vegetarians.And last year, a team from the University of Pennsylvania and Brian Wansink of Cornell University showed consumers link meat with masculinity and concluded was 'a strong, traditional, macho, bicep-flexing, all-American food.'Prof Rothberger, told MSNBC he set out to find out why so many Americans cling to their meat-eating habits despite research showing that eating a lot of meat is bad for our health and for the environment.He said: 'There’s a growing awareness that it’s not great to eat meat, but still, people are doing it.'

It may have been a rainy day in Manchester, but Katie Price seemed determined to flash the flesh as she stepped out on a lunch date. Donning an extremely racy ensemble, the 34-year-old star showed off not only a bright pink visible bra, but also more than her fair share of thigh in a pair of dramatic slashed black leggings. The mother-of-three was spotted leaving the city's exclusive Lowry Hotel and later arrived at Panacea in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, where she was reportedly meeting up with footballer Dwight Yorke, the father of her eldest son, Harvey, 10. Sexy: Katie Price donned a racy ensemble of slashed black leggings and a see-through top with visible bra as she stepped out in Manchester on Monday
It would seem the star caused a spot of havoc by parking her bright pink Range Rover in a bus stop, before later moving it to a car park, where it sat side-by-side with an identical blue model. More...

Katie made sure to show off her famous curves for the surprise meeting, teaming a see-through cream vest top with her revealing leggings and a pair of towering leopardprint shoe boots. Wrapping up against the cold winter weather in a charcoal grey cable knit jumper, the former glamour model made sure to add a touch of glamour to her outfit with a pair of oversized shades - despite the rainy weather.

Fair weather: Footballer Dwight braved the weather to venture out and meet ex Katie with whom he shares son Harvey
Although the star's reasons for allegedly meeting her ex are not known, there is no doubt Katie has endured a stressful time of late. After splitting from her fiance, Argentinean model Leandro Penna, late last month, Katie claimed she had been left riddled with debt. Speaking to The Sun newspaper, she said: 'I've broken up with my husband-to-be and discovered I've been left saddled with debts that he has left behind.' Rainy day: Katie was spotted leaving Manchester's exclusive Lowry Hotel, where she was being shielded by a member of staff carrying a huge umbrella
