Plus-size models have been making strides in the fashion world recently, and now another has been chosen to grace the cover of a major, mainstream magazine. Justine Legault, 26, looks effortlessly chic as Elle Quebec's May 2013 cover girl, striking a pose in a white shirtdress, her blonde
hair styled in natural waves.And rather than attempting to conceal her curves, the image celebrates the 5ft 9in, size 14 model's full-figured thighs, placing them front and center. Beautiful at any size: French-Canadian model Justine Legault, 26, has been chosen as the cover girl for this month's Elle Quebec Magazine. At five-foot-nine and a U.S. size 14, she fully embraces her womanly curves
With her blonde locks, soft features and green eyes, Miss Legault, who has done fashion campaigns for Nordstrom, Macy's and Avenue, to name a few, exudes timeless beauty.In the interview with the magazine, the French-speaking model - whose dream was once working behind the camera - explains that she was discovered by chance at the age of 20 by an agency looking for a plus-size girl.

'At my first photo shoot, I remember hearing the photographer call my agent on the phone and say, "Oh my god! We've got something here!"' she said.And after her career began to take off, Miss Legault moved from Quebec to New York, where she now lives and
is represented by Muse NYC.'My beauty regime is similar to other models, except that I love a good meal!'
'My beauty regime is similar to that of other models,' she explains, noting that her job means she has to take care of her skin and maintain her figure. 'Except that I love a good meal and I eat very well!' she adds.The reactions to Miss Legault's cover
and spread have overwhelmingly positive, with fans praising her for embracing her womanly curves, as well as applauding the magazine's decision to choose her.One supporter wrote on the magazine's website: 'So nice to see the cover of Elle Quebec take on a new shape. Bravo.' Real woman: 'My beauty regime is similar to that of other models,' Miss Legault explains, noting that she, too, has to take care of her skin and maintain her figure. 'Except that I love a good meal and I eat very well!'
Another said: 'Bravo Elle Quebec for the May issue! I received it yesterday and as soon as I laid eyes on the cover, I said to myself, "Finally! A plus-size model." It's great to see the 'real world' sometimes.'And while some may criticize her or judge her solely on her appearance, Miss Legault says it doesn't faze her.'How many times have people told me during an audition: "I don't like your hair, I don't like your teeth…?"' she says. 'I didn't listen to those people and I continued to have confidence in myself. I prefer to remember compliments from people who like me how I am, and believe in me.' Read more:

"People are such delicate flowers and just can't handle the TRUTH. And hell yeah, I can do a 100 meters, easy, unlike that fat, greasy "model". Spike, Los Angeles ---------- Judging by your childish nonsense you wouldn't know the TRUTH if it fell on your head. I guarantee not only are you NOT in shape like you claim, but that you also have zero experience with women in real life. I've never seen a sane man judge a woman's physical attractiveness on how fast she can run a 100 meter dash! The silliness of your point aside, if you really even cared about fitness you wouldn't be attracted to starving twigs with zero muscle mass who would pass out if they tried running the same 100 meters you keep screaming about.

Oh here we go the 'real' women campaigners out in force. Who cares what size she is, it's the fashion industry paying lipservice to the fad du jour. There will always be slim women proclaiming their superiority over fat women and fat women proclaiming theirs over slim women. Ultimately, just be happy who you are and if you aren't then do something about it. I can't run 10 metres anymore and I'd love to be able to do that again (AS and Lupus), the model probably can, as can girls bigger and smaller than her so it's a stupid argument. Guys, sure you go ahead and criticise an unknown woman for her looks, but I'm sure that there will be those who find you equally repugnant or attractive depending who you ask. All I do know is that the magazine will probably find that this cover will have the lowest sales of the year, and that's the sad truth because we've been indoctrinated to see size as the be all and end all.

" I'll bet she can't pass 10 meters without gasping for air or dropping dead of a massive coronary." Spike, los angeles ---- Oh and I bet YOU can:) Because I'm sure you're an Olympic runner when not trolling internet message boards. What I want to see is one of those starving skeletors you prefer try and do a squat without their stick legs breaking in half. - York , New York------------------------------------People are such delicate flowers and just can't handle the TRUTH. And hell yeah, I can do a 100 meters, easy, unlike that fat, greasy "model".

A doctor today revealed her desperate battle to save a nine-year-old boy's life after he was crushed by a falling tree during a training session at a cricket ground.Karolina Miller gave emergency first aid to Lewis Gaston who was struck by the tree during gales at Spencer Cricket Club in Earlsfield, west London.She told how he appeared lifeless with a fractured skull and was unable to breath after the accident on Saturday. Shock: The tree fell on the three boys at at Spencer Cricket Club in Earlsfield, south west London
Practice nets: Two boys were seriously hurt when a tree fell onto the nets at Spencer Cricket Ground
Dr Miller, who works at Dorset county
Hospital, said: 'I gently took his head in my hands as we laid him on the ground and put him in the recovery position. 'He was not breathing. I kept calling his name and telling him to swallow as he had a blockage.
'He eventually did and I was able to open his mouth and help him breath.'
The three injured friends – Aidan Oakley, Lewis Gaston and George Roberts – were among 50 boys waiting in line to practise their bowling at the Spencer Cricket Club when a huge lime tree was blown on to them on Saturday afternoon. Aidan, who was trapped underneath the
trunk, was released from hospital yesterday while Lewis and George were
being closely monitored. Their condition was said to be improving.
Terrible accident: Three children were hurt when a large tree came down during high winds in Earlsfield
Aidan’s father Christopher, 47, yesterday told how he rushed to help after seeing the tree fall on his son. With the help of other parents, players and spectators he managed to lift the tree to drag his son and the two other boys out. Speaking from his home in Wandsworth, Mr Oakley said: ‘It was very frightening. Suddenly this tree just took them all out.’ Although his son was pinned under the
tree by his torso, it was Lewis and George who were worst hurt, after being hit on the head by its branches. ‘Aidan is OK, just scratches to his legs, but we were very shaken. Obviously our thoughts are with Lewis and George.’
Mr Oakley said the boys had been practising for what should have been their first match as Surrey Inner London under 9s yesterday morning. The match was cancelled after the accident and the club yesterday postponed all further fixtures until an investigation is carried out. Stuart Broad, left, and Andrew Flintoff,right, have reached out to the three boys, sending messages and signed shirts
Charlie Masson-Smith, of Wandsworth Council, described it as a ‘terrible accident’, adding: ‘You can have a really healthy tree, but if the wind catches in a particular way a healthy tree can be blown over.’ A spokesman for the Spencer Club, which was founded in 1872, said: ‘The club would like to thank all those
from around the world who have sent the boys their best wishes.’
Their plight prompted former cricketer Andrew Flintoff to send a special message of support and inspired current star Stuart Broad to send the boys shirts signed by the
England team.After news of the accident broke, a number of cricketers tweeted messages of support.Andrew Flintoff wrote: 'Sorry to hear the news from Spencer CC @alextudorcoach ! thoughts and prayers are with the youngsters and their parents mate x'Former team skipper Michael Vaughan tweeted: 'Big thanks to @StuartBroad8 who will be getting signed England shirts for the 3 boys injured at Spencers CC.' Monique Wilkinson, 33, was staging a birthday party for her three-year-old daughter at her home when she heard the tree fall.Reliving the horror, she said: 'We could see the kids stuck under the tree and there were a lot of people around. It's terrible.'These kids play on the field every weekend.'The air ambulance landed in the field across the road from us and there were four or five ambulances in total.'The emergency services seemed to have everything under control.'Another tree came down on this road earlier in the day which shows how bad the winds were.'The strongest winds yesterday were in Southampton, where they reached as high as 56mph.'That is a strong gust for the time of year,' MeteoGroup senior forecaster Brendan Jones said.'Across most of southern England and south Wales there have been gusts of 45 to 50mph which is pretty blustery.'In Blackpool, the inaugural concert by Sir Elton John at a new venue was cut short last night by strong winds. Unsafe: Police advised Sir Elton to stop playing due to the high winds
Nearly
two hours into his set at the Blackpool Tower Headland outdoor arena, Elton told a disappointed crowd of almost 11,000 that on police advice he had been told to stop playing. In
Bournemouth, a charity 10k run due to take place today has also been
hit after a thick layer of sand was blown off the beach on to the seafront course.The seafront road was covered with up to a foot of sand, leaving Bournemouth
Borough Council with insufficient time to clear it before the Cancer Research UK Race for Life events. Cancelled: Cancer Research UK's 10km Race for Life has been scrapped due to the thick layer of sand blown onto the seafront road in Bournemouth, but the 5km is still scheduled
Hazel Bedford, spokeswoman for Cancer Research UK, said: 'The sand drifts mean you cannot see where the road ends and the beach starts in some areas. KAYAKER DIES IN WALES A male kayaker has died in 'challenging' river conditions.Police were called to the River Conwy in Betws-y-Coed in Snowdonia, North Wales, at about 3.30pm yesterday.The body was recovered from the water near the Fairy Glen Hotel.A spokesman for North Wales Police said: 'The investigation is still ongoing and the next of kin have yet to be informed.'Emergency
services would like to advise all watersports people visiting the area that the rivers in the vicinity are very full and conditions are challenging.Caution should be exercised
'We don't want to risk twisted ankles
or people falling, so for safety's sake, we are going to restrict the course to the 5k that the council is kindly able to clear for us.'
Nearly 5,680 women are due to take part in the Bournemouth events, 700 of them in the 10k.Emergency services have reported that a number of other trees and power lines have come down today, elsewhere in the country.
In Plymouth, Devon, a tree was uprooted and sent crashing down into a family home by heavy winds around 8am Saturday.A window was smashed and railings damaged, but miraculously no one was hurt.Heavy rain fell yesterday in the country's west, along with Wales and Northern Ireland.Forecaster Brendan Jones said today would be calmer but the bad weather would return by the evening.'It will be a better day, winds will be a lot lighter before going downhill tonight when there is a going to be heavy rain and the chance of some flooding in the
south east corner,' Mr Jones said.'There could be 20-30mm of rain in just a few hours.' Lucky escape: The occupants of this house in Plymouth escaped unhurt when a large tree came down in high winds and smashed into their home
