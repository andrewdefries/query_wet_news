COMMENTEMAILMOREThe clock is ticking for Georgia, like it is for the rest of the FBS, but the Bulldogs' clock remains stuck on one number in particular: five. As in five yards to the end zone. Or five seconds left. Georgia's 2012 season came down to those numbers, those moments, and the Bulldogs' inability to seal the deal against Alabama in the SEC title game.So, in a sense, Georgia's 2013 season began before its 2012 campaign came to a close. This year's team – 10 starters back on offense, almost entirely rebuilt on defense – takes its incalculable motivation from those five seconds, when a battle-tested team came up short, both in time and distance, against a team currently atop the heap in the SEC.Want to get to Pasadena? Better bring your 60-minute game. Want to stick around for another set in the weight room, spend another hour in the film room, run one more set of stairs? Think about Alabama, the SEC and a quest for the national championship, those five seconds and five yards left on the field. Championship teams have found motivation in far less.NO. 125 TO NO. 1: College football countdownLAST YEAR'S PREDICTIONWe need to see Georgia get rattled and still prevail in the second half, and not just once, and not just against a team like Vanderbilt, but against the real power teams on this slate – South Carolina, perhaps Tennessee and Florida, perhaps an Alabama or LSU should the Bulldogs repeat as East champs. Beyond the offensive line and the kicking game, this is Georgia's biggest hurdle: the 60-minute game. If the Bulldogs can show that fortitude against a title-worthy team, then the sky is the limit. For now, this is clearly the top team in the SEC East and one of seven or eight teams that can make a serious run towards a national championship. Anything less than a 10-2 regular season would mark a substantial disappointment.2012 RECAP— In a nutshell: The Bulldogs won 12 games for the third time in school history, the second time under coach Mark Richt, and notched another SEC East Division championship. Then came the title game: Georgia fought back admirably, going blow-for-blow with the nation's best team in one of the memorable games of the season, eventually drawing within four points, five yards and five seconds of a legendary victory – but then fell, defeated, in an indefinably painful loss. That the Bulldogs bounced back a month later to unseat Nebraska in the Capital One Bowl reflected well on the coaches, the players and the team's inherent leadership; another team might have wilted in the postseason, especially given how the loss to Alabama dropped the Bulldogs from the national championship game to a non-BCS bowl. One pass – one completed pass, rather – was all that separated Georgia from a date with Notre Dame in Miami.— High point: Wins against Florida and Georgia Tech, followed by the bowl victory against Nebraska. The former handed Georgia the East Division, setting up the date with Alabama. Topping the Yellow Jackets is always good for business. As noted, the Bulldogs bounced back nicely to top the Cornhuskers.— Low point: Alabama. It's a loss that'll live in history. Check your local listings for replays.— Tidbit: Georgia is 10-2 in season openers under Richt. The Bulldogs have been ranked in the preseason in 11 of Richt's 12 seasons, with the lone outlier in 2001, his first year in Athens. Georgia's two season-opening losses under Richt came away from home against top-10 competition: Georgia lost to No. 9 Oklahoma State in 2009 and No. 5 Boise State in 2011. This year's opener is at No. 8 Clemson, as you may have heard.— Tidbit (recruiting edition): The Bulldogs' 2013 recruiting class was rated as one of the best in the country by every recruiting service, which isn't new. What is new: Georgia had 13 players enroll early, the most in program history. Enrolling more than a dozen players in time for spring drills will Georgia weather a storm of attrition its defense, which returns only two full-time starters from a season ago.— Tidbit (turnovers edition): Georgia is 18-3 since the start of the 2007 season when intercepting two or more passes, including a 3-0 mark in such games a year ago. In fact, this record improves to 18-1 when counting only regular-season games; two of these losses came in bowl play, to Michigan State in the 2012 Outback Bowl and UCF in the 2010 Liberty Bowl.FORMER PLAYERS IN THE NFL— 48: OG Justin Anderson (Indianapolis), DT Geno Atkins (Cincinnati), CB Champ Bailey (Denver), K Brandon Bogotay (Cleveland), OG Clint Boling (Cincinnati), CB Brandon Boykin (Philadelphia), WR Marlon Brown (Baltimore), P Drew Butler (Pittsburgh), FB Shaun Chapas (Detroit), TE Orson Charles (Cincinnati), DE Chris Clemons (Seattle), CB Sanders Commings (Kansas City), LB Thomas Davis (Carolina), LB Akeem Dent (Atlanta), TE Demarcus Dobbs (San Francisco), WR Kris Durham (Detroit), LB Dannell Ellerbe (Miami), DE Robert Geathers (Cincinnati), DT Kwame Geathers (San Diego), OT Cordy Glenn (Buffalo), DE Kedric Golston (Washington), WR A.J.

Don Mattingly2. J.T. Snow3. Keith Hernandez4. Mark Grace5. Wally JoynerCOACHING— Mark Richt (Miami '82), 118-41 after a dozen seasons with the Bulldogs. After two ugly years – three if you consider 2008, when Georgia entered the year ranked No. 1 but lost three games – Richt has led the Bulldogs back to the top of the SEC East during the last two seasons. Georgia's return to the upper crust of the SEC put some of the bloom back on Richt's rose; we have all been reminded of the great work he's done over his decade-plus at the forefront of this program. The next step, one that has remained slightly out of Georgia's grasp, is the complete, 60-minute game needed to top Alabama and take the top spot in the SEC.From the start, Richt has maintained the Bulldogs' place among the top programs in the nation. After going 8-4 in 2001, his debut season, tying a Georgia record for wins by a rookie coach, Richt led the Bulldogs to a team-record 13 wins in 2002, a season that culminated in an SEC championship. Richt duplicated that feat in 2005, when he led Georgia to a 10-3 mark and its second conference title. There had been no real down point prior to 2010 for the Bulldogs since Richt took over, though one could point out the 9-4 mark in 2006 as a previous, brief lull for the Georgia program. Only five SEC coaches have won 10 games or more in four straight seasons: Richt (2002-5), Nick Saban (2008-13), Bear Bryant (1971-74, 1977-80), Vince Dooley (1980-83), Phil Fulmer (1995-98) and Steve Spurrier (1993-98). How about that list?And though Georgia Tech stole a few headlines from the Bulldogs in the early days following Paul Johnson's arrival, Richt remains 11-1 against the program's arch-rival; the Bulldogs have held the Yellow Jackets to 17 points or less in nine of those 11 victories. Prior to taking the Georgia job – his first head coach position – Richt spent 15 years as an assistant at Florida State, the last seven as offensive coordinator. During that seven-year stint, the Seminoles went 76-9-1, winning the 1999 national title. In the nine years following his departure, FSU went 74-42 with only a single 10-win season. Coincidence? Nope. This guy can coach, pure and simple.PLAYERS TO WATCH— Offense: Two things separate Aaron Murray from every other quarterback in the country: experience and production. What else can you ask for? Murray enters 2013 with 41 career starts, the most of any player in the FBS; he's won 22 of his last 26 starts, leading the Bulldogs to back-to-back SEC East championships – and within a hair of the national title game a year ago. He also leads all active FBS quarterbacks with 95 career touchdown passes and stands fourth in the FBS in career quarterback efficiency rating; Murray threw for 3,893 yards and 38 scores a year ago, helping Georgia score a school-record 529 points. With another solid season, Murray will break the SEC record for career touchdown passes, break Georgia's record for career yards and become the third quarterback in FBS history to throw for 3,000 yards in each of his four seasons, joining Timmy Chang and Kellen Moore. What does your quarterback bring to the table? Murray brings experience, production, leadership, toughness and gumption, five assets that separate him from the vast majority of his quarterbacking peers. Sit back and enjoy: Murray is a Heisman Trophy contender, a championship-caliber leader and, before too long, the finest quarterback in school history.You can't think of one without the other, so let's combine the two: Todd Gurley (1,385 yards and 17 touchdowns) and Keith Marshall (759 yards) combined for 2,144 yards and 25 touchdowns last fall, as true freshmen, and enter 2013 having progressed to the point where anything but continued improvement would come as a significant surprise. Who's the leader? I guess it's Gurley, who quickly earned that right with a sublimely consistent rookie season – scoring nine touchdowns in September and racking up at least 100 yards six times during SEC play. But you can't have one without the other, as noted, and Marshall quietly – well, somewhat quietly – chips in his fair share of game-changing production when given the opportunity. What separates this pair from most backs in the FBS isn't their speed or elusiveness, since that's not an overly rare commodity; what makes Gurley and Marshall different is that they combine these qualities with size, allowing Georgia to pound away inside while maintaining a very dangerous outside running attack. You're starting to see a clear trend: Georgia is identifying bigger backs on the recruiting trail, with this recent class as further evidence, and Gurley and Marshall are the prototype backs for this system. It's not out of the realm of possibility that both crack the 1,000-yard as sophomores.Aaron Murray pilots one of the best offenses in college football.(Photo: Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports)The growth of junior Malcolm Mitchell (40 receptions for 572 yards) and the healthy return of junior Michael Bennett (24 for 345) will help Georgia's receiver corps survive the loss of Tavarres King, last year's leading pass-catcher. Mitchell, who has dabbled on defense during his first two years, has the body, leaping ability and overall athleticism to shine as Georgia's go-to target. Bennett, meanwhile, was on pace for a banner 2012 season before his year was cut short due to injury in October. This duo teams with projected All-American tight end Arthur Lynch (24 for 431) to give Georgia's passing game a superb top grouping. Where the Bulldogs' receiver corps can separate itself from the pack, however, is in the team's terrific depth at each position. Junior Chris Conley (20 for 342) will see enormous time behind Mitchell at flanker, as will senior Rantavious Wooten (15 for 187). Along with Bennett, Georgia can use sophomore Justin Scott-Wesley, senior Rhett McGowan and touted JUCO transfer Jonathon Rumph. Behind Lynch, the Bulldogs have a significant degree of trust in sophomore Jay Rome (11 for 152), who played extensively as a rookie. This receiver corps stands only behind Alabama in the SEC.No other team in the championship hunt can say the same: Georgia returns its entire starting five and the majority of its two-deep, making this offensive line one of the top units in college football – on paper, at least. But if last year's growth is any indication, Georgia's front really should be one of the nation's best; the only thing holding this group back is its unsteadiness in protection, but that should be improved due to added experience. You know the names: senior Kenarious Gates at left tackle, senior Dallas Lee at left guard, junior David Andrews at center, senior Chris Burnette at right guard and sophomore John Theus at right tackle. Theus is a star in the making. Depth is also stronger, especially with junior Kolton Houston's ability to step into the starting lineup at right guard and tackle. On the left side, juniors Mark Beard and Watts Dantzler are trustworthy reserves.— Defense: It's a bit misleading to say the Bulldogs returns only two starters on defense, since five defenders have started at least five career games, but nonetheless: Georgia's lack of overall experience – especially when held against the cream of the crop – is ample cause for concern. The biggest issue is the secondary, as we'll touch on below, but no one unit is amply stocked with experience and proven production. This is an issue. How can Georgia survive? Well, there's a chance the Bulldogs' defense doesn't survive, instead serving as this team's Achilles heel. There's also a chance that the many early enrollees have already grasped the schemes, meaning that Georgia's defense, while young, will be more than athletic enough to flourish in coordinator Todd Grantham's system. Let's give some credit: Grantham has remade the Bulldogs' defensive mentality and degree of confidence.The second level is the strongest group on this defense. In my mind, in fact, the Bulldogs' linebacker corps will exceed many expectations if it remains healthy – because I like the starting four, but the youthful nature of the second tier is a noteworthy concern. The new star, replacing Jarvis Jones, will be sophomore Jordan Jenkins (31 tackles, 5.0 sacks), who showed clear all-SEC potential as a spot starter and key reserve a season ago. Can Jenkins replicate Jones' production? No, but few can. What he can do, however, is show consistent growth while putting his speed, athleticism and aggressiveness to good use coming off the edge – since the numbers will come as Jenkins adds more moves to his repertoire. In terms of leadership, the entire defense should take its cue from junior Amarlo Herrera (70 tackles), a steady hand at inside linebacker. Joining Herrera inside is junior Ramik Wilson, who will take a sizable step up in playing time; behind this pair, however, are true freshmen Reggie Carter and Tim Kimbrough. On the outside, Georgia will team Jenkins with sophomores Josh Dawson and James DeLoach, with true freshman Leonard Floyd standing in reserve.Georgia signed two JUCO defensive linemen in February, Toby Johnson and Chris Mayes, and both should be heavy factors in the rotation by the heart of SEC play. Mayes has already made a push for playing time at the open nose tackle position, and should rotate with junior Mike Thornton in the opener. One noticeable difference: Mayes and Thornton come in at 321 pounds and 290 pounds, respectively; last year's nose tackles, John Jenkins and Kwame Geathers, tipped the scales at 358 and 355 pounds, respectively. So that spot has gotten smaller, it seems, and that's a bit of an on-paper worry for this defensive front. Johnson will see some time at end, but he'll have to crack the top quartet to earn playing time. Senior Garrison Smith (57 tackles), the Bulldogs' most experienced lineman, will be joined in the starting lineup by sophomore Sterling Bailey, who barely saw the field as a freshman. The third end is junior Ray Drew (23 tackles), who must deliver when moved into the lineup. The Bulldogs also have redshirt freshman John Taylor, all 335 pounds of him, and I wonder if he could be a valuable swing lineman for this defense – spending some time at end in bigger packages while also moving inside to provide additional depth.— Special teams: Sophomore kicker Marshall Morgan will be special once his technique catches up with his booming leg. He should put that leg to good use on kickoffs, helping Georgia's coverage teams continue to improve after a major lull in 2011. A bigger issue in the kicking game is the production from sophomore punter Colin Barber. Mitchell leads the way on both kickoffs and punts, though Gurley – as evidenced by his early-season success – can be a game-changing returner if given the opportunity.POSITION(S) TO WATCH— Secondary: Clemson's coming. The date in Death Valley stands four days away, not counting today, and this is an issue – because Georgia's secondary looks even less stable this week than it did in April, which is saying something. The big-picture concern is that Georgia lost three starters from last season's secondary and has not been able to identify replacements, largely due to injuries. This is a concern that defines this defense, as well as an issue that could end up defining the Bulldogs' quest for Pasadena. But a bigger issue stands ahead: Clemson. How will the Bulldogs defend Tajh Boyd, Sammy Watkins, Charone Peak and this passing game with so little experience on the two-deep? Remember that projected starter Josh Harvey-Clemson will miss the game due to a suspension, robbing Georgia of a starting safety and nickel back – with the latter a huge loss. Overall, counting the loss of the three starters, Harvey-Clemons' suspension and the injuries, Georgia will start at least one freshman against Clemson and perhaps two – and should play as many as three freshmen in major roles altogether.Phew. You can lock junior Damian Swann (53 tackles, 4 interceptions) into a starting role, obviously, and pencil him in for some level of all-conference honors. For Clemson, however, Swann might be used more in the slot, replacing Harvey-Clemons. If so, Georgia's outside cornerbacks will be sophomore Sheldon Dawson and true freshmen Brendan Langley and Shaq Wiggins – again, true freshmen. Another true freshman, Tray Matthews, will get the nod at free safety for the opener, ahead of fellow true freshman Quincy Mauger. That's not a great situation. At least the Bulldogs know they can rely on senior strong safety Connor Norman (18 tackles), who could also slide into the slot as the nickel back. In fact, when it comes to the Clemson game, I'd think Georgia would rather keep Swann outside – or match him up with Watkins – and push Norman into the slot, promoting one of juniors Corey Moore and Shaquille Fluker into the starting job at strong safety. How will things look when everyone is available? Harvey-Clemons will flex between safety and the slot, Norman will play both safety positions and Swann will star on the outside, but no matter how you cut it, Georgia's going to play a ton of true freshmen in the secondary.GAME(S) TO WATCH— Clemson: Why is Clemson the most important game on the schedule? Here's one reason: Georgia's worst team of 2013 will be its first team, the untested defense that steps onto the field against Tajh Boyd and the Tigers. Here's another reason: Losing to Clemson dooms Georgia's title hopes, in my opinion, because unlike a one-loss West Division team, the Bulldogs won't have major opportunities after September – because Clemson, South Carolina and LSU all come in September. Then again, there's a strong case to be made for the Gamecocks, a game the Bulldogs obviously cannot afford to lose if they hope to net another SEC East championship.SEASON BREAKDOWN & PREDICTION— In a nutshell: The offense alone makes Georgia a major SEC contender and an obvious threat for a BCS bid. It's the defense that gives me pause, as it does with many others, and it's hard to imagine how the Bulldogs can roll through this schedule unscathed unless the younger tier of the two-deep delivers in starting and secondary roles. Remember that the defense opens with a bang, at Clemson, before coming back home for South Carolina; after a win against North Texas, the Bulldogs play host to LSU. My point: Georgia's defense gets no breathing room, and must step forward from the start to keep Georgia's title hopes alive before heading into a far more manageable October and November.It's about surviving early. Good thing the Bulldogs' offense is around to carry the load. This is an offense to love: Murray is an all-everything quarterback, Gurley and Marshall are superb, the receiver corps has three go-to leaders along with nice depth, and the offensive line has the makings of Richt's best front in several years. The offense should be the one of the best in college football; it should also be the best in program history, even if last year's totals may be tough to top. Georgia's quest for a national championship will ride the back of this offense – and it's an offense capable of lifting this team to the national title game.My take: I love the offense – adore the offense, admire its leadership, consistency, weapons and athleticism – but have significant concerns with the Bulldogs' defense. I'm not alone in that regard. The Bulldogs' best-case scenario is the influx of young speed and talent holds down the fort against Clemson, South Carolina and LSU, pushing Georgia into October at 4-0. If this team is 4-0 on Oct. 1 it will go undefeated. Agreed? The nightmare is that the defense is unsteady early, leading to a pair of September losses and ending Georgia's championship and SEC hopes. Each scenario is plausible. The offense is an exclamation point; the defense is a question mark. That's Georgia in 2013. It's on Murray and the gang to carry this team to perfection – and that's a possibility. I have Georgia at no worse than 10-2, very likely 11-1, neck-and-neck with South Carolina, with that date against the Gamecocks deciding the SEC East. Going 11-1 and taking the East means Georgia will very likely head into the SEC title game needing a win to play for the national championship.— Dream season: Georgia goes 12-0 in the regular season and knocks off Alabama in the SEC title game, scoring on a short passing play with five seconds to win by three points.— Nightmare season: The Bulldogs go 9-3, losing to Clemson, South Carolina and Florida, and finish third in the SEC East.— All-name team nominee: TE Jake Star.UP NEXT— Who is No. 5? This team once went 0-11, scoring only 12 total points in the entire month of September (four games).2013 TEAM OVERVIEW— Conference: SEC, East— Location: Athens, Ga.— Nickname: Bulldogs— Returning starters: 12 (10 offense, 2 defense)— Last year's ranking: No. 6— 2012 record: 12-2 (7-1)— Last year's re-ranking: No. 7— 2013 schedule:Aug. 31 at ClemsonSept. 7 South CarolinaSept. 21 North TexasSept. 28 LSUOct. 5 at TennesseeOct. 12 MissouriOct. 19 VanderbiltNov. 2 vs. Florida (in Jacksonville, Fla.)Nov. 9 Appalachian StateNov. 16 at AuburnNov. 23 KentuckyNov. 30 at Georgia TechPaul Myerberg, a national college football writer for USA TODAY Sports, is on Twitter @PaulMyerberg.PHOTOS: COUNTING DOWN TO NO. 1FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInNCAA preview: Ranking college football teams 50-1 FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 50. East Carolina: The Pirates join Marshall and Tulsa as the three best teams in Conference USA. Look for the season finale between the Pirates and the Thundering Herd to determine the East Division. Can ECU be one of the more surprising teams to come out of Conference USA? Without a doubt: ECU is very potent offensively and should have its best defense under fourth-year coach Ruffin McNeill, so a conference championship is very much a possibility. USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
49. Louisiana-Lafayette: This team's excellent offense and strong defense makes it the favorite to win the Sun Belt Conference championship. This is one thing missing during coach Mark Hudspeth's otherwise superb two-year tenure with the program. While the Ragin' Cajuns' have some issues with the kicking game, that shouldn't prevent this team from winning eight or nine games during the regular season. USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
48. San Diego State: SDS's schedule should prevent another season with nine wins, but the Aztecs are easily one of the top three teams in the Mountain West Conference and a threat to Fresno State in the West Division. Games against Ohio State, Oregon State, Fresno State and Boise State should end in defeat, but the majority of the Mountain West lacks SDSU's talent, experience and solid coaching. USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
47. Mississippi: Ole Miss returns 18 starters, the most in the SEC, and reeled in one of the nation's best recruiting classes on national signing day. Will it be enough to join Alabama, Texas A&M and LSU in the race for the SEC West Division championship? It would not be wise to doubt coach Hugh Freeze, but the Rebels might need another year (and another recruiting class) before challenging for the SEC championship. USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
46. Ball State: The Cardinals have gone 15-10 under coach Pete Lembo, winning nine games and reaching a bowl in 2012
The offense, led by quarterback Keith Wenning, should be one of the MAC's three best. To beat Northern Illinois and Toledo, the Cardinals must improve defensively. Danny Wild, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
45. North Carolina: UNC enters year two under coach Larry Fedora with one of the ACC's best offenses but continued question marks on the defensive side of the ball. To return to the top of a crowded Coastal Division, UNC must do a better job stopping the run and forcing turnovers. While the Tar Heels have 10-win potential, a tough first half could lead to a fourth-place finish in the division. Sam Sharpe, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
44. Toledo: The program has reeled in the MAC's top recruiting class not merely once but in each of the past four years, according to the rankings compiled by Rivals.com. This year's seniors have gone 26-13 during the past three seasons Andrew Weber, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
43. Arizona State: Quite clearly a Pac-12 South and Rose Bowl contender, a team with athleticism to burn on both sides of the ball, increased familiarity with the second-year coaching staff and the sort of next-level talent– any national challenger needs to weather the storm. Cary Edmondson, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
42: UCF: This team joins the American Athletic Conference, along with three others former Conference USA rivals, and immediately becomes one of two strongest challengers to Louisville's place atop the league. Surprisingly, the Knights' issues are on defense, long an area of strength for the program. The offense, on the other hand, might be the American's best overall unit. USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
41. Washington: This team already has the talent needed to challenge Stanford and Oregon for the Pac-12 North Division and a spot in the Rose Bowl. What the Huskies need is time to develop the many redshirt freshmen, sophomores and juniors set for starting or key reserve roles. With only two seniors set for starting jobs, UW might be a year away from reaching its full potential. USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
40. Marshall: The program of Donnan and Pruett, Pennington and Leftwich enters the 2013 season with its highest expectations in more than a decade. After some fits and starts under fourth-year coach Doc Holliday – a step forward, two steps back – Marshall has the talent and offensive direction to storm through a reworked and revamped Conference USA and challenge for nine or more wins during the regular season. 2013-07-29-marshallFullscreen
39. Ohio: There's no ignoring the Bobcats' talent and experience in the secondary. Returning cornerbacks like Carrie and Shaw, along with Wells and Fisher, give the Bobcats depth at the position unmatched – or even neared – by any rival in the MAC. Andrew Weber, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
38. Vanderbilt: The Commodores won nine games for the first in nearly a century last season, with five wins against the SEC. Last year's team finished 20th in the USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll, and compiled the nation's 19th-best recruiting class, according to Rivals.com. Mark Humphrey, APFullscreen
37. Penn State: The Nittany Lions will need to replace eight starters, and the roster will lean more and more on non-scholarship players to augment smaller recruiting classes. The players will change, the standards might change, but the formula will remain the same: Coach Bill O'Brien will develop skill players, putting his talent in position to succeed, and weather the storm with every tool at his disposal. USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
36. Oregon State: Last season marked a nice return to the status quo. OSU was picked sixth in the Pac-12 North Division – last, behind Washington State – and won nine games, ending the year in third place in the North, inside the top 20 nationally, back on the national radar. So what happens when the Beavers, picked third in the 2013 preseason poll, are handed logical expectations? USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
35. Georgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets' offense is more diverse and dynamic than it often gets credit for being. Sophomore Vad Lee, who has shown aptitude as a passer in addition to running chops, is the likely QB.
In terms of career starts among its players, Georgia Tech is the FBS' third-most experienced team. Bob Donnan, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
34. Cincinnati: The Bearcats have a new coach, Tommy Tuberville, but enough returning talent and experience to challenge Louisville for the American Athletic Conference championship. Cincinnati also has one of the nation's easiest schedules, and could start 8-0 before hitting a snag in November. The season finale against Louisville could decide a Bowl Championship Series berth. Al Behrman, APFullscreen
33. Baylor: The team's offense will continue to rank among the nation's best despite a change at quarterback, with junior Bryce Petty stepping into a starting role. Whether the Bears can leap into the Bowl Championship Series conversation depends on the play of a questionable if talented defense. Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
32. Brigham Young: BYU has one of the best defenses in college football, which should help the Cougars survive what will again be one of the toughest schedules in the country. But to gain a national ranking, BYU needs help from new starting quarterback Taysom Hill and the rest of the offense. Kirby Lee, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
31. Wisconsin: This team has a new coach, Gary Andersen, but the standards won’t change. The Badgers have won three Big Ten titles in a row and reached three consecutive Rose Bowls, and enters 2013 with the same sense of purpose despite the new staff. But to get back to Pasadena, Wisconsin needs to choose a starting quarterback and solve some personnel issues in the defensive backfield. Andy Manis, APFullscreen
30. UCLA: Jim Mora led the Bruins to the Pac-12 South Division title, upending USC in the process, marking his debut campaign a nearly unqualified success. With key returners and recruits, the next step is moving past the rival Trojans. Christopher Hanewinckel, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
29. TCU: The Horned Frogs will deal with inexperience, youth and attrition – so it's similar to 2012, if to a lessened degree. In many ways, whether the Horned Frogs can regain their place in the championship picture hinges on one factor: whether TCU is stronger for last year's growing pains. USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
28. Miami: This team enters 2013 with its best chance at an ACC championship in several years. But to reach that point, the Hurricanes must augment a very prolific offense with a stronger defense. For now, Miami has the weapons to score points on any team in the ACC but can’t be viewed as a championship contender until a young and untested defense rounds into form. USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
27. Michigan State: The Spartans continue to house one of the nation’s best defenses, a group more than good enough to lift this team to the Rose Bowl. To rebound from last season’s disappointing seven-win finish, Michigan State must land more production from quarterback Andrew Maxwell and a stable of four or five backs battling to replace Le’Veon Bell. Al Goldis, APFullscreen
26. Tulsa: The Golden Hurricane should be viewed as a heavy favorite to win another Conference USA championship. Tulsa has bigger goals, however, and could conceivably reach the Bowl Championship Series with a strong September against opponents like Oklahoma and Iowa State. For now, this team has too many issues on defense and is too reliant on freshmen for depth to be considered more than a contender for a national ranking. USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
25. Fresno State: The team’s offense will be one of the best in the country. Quarterback Derek Carr, the third-year starter, should be viewed as an All-American contender and a darkhorse Heisman Trophy candidate. Whether the Bulldogs can win more than 10 games hinges on the defense’s ability to replace several stars, including an All-American at safety. The season will come down to two games against Boise State, one in the regular season and another in Mountain West Conference title game, should the Bulldogs reach that point. Brian Losness, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
24. Kansas State: This year's squad enters a rebuilding year, a season far removed from last year's 11 wins, Big 12 title and Fiesta Bowl berth. Ten returning starters? No Heisman Trophy contenders? No All-American linebacker? The basic tune remains the same, just altered for 2013: KSU was questioned heading into last September. There's no reason to doubt Bill Snyder. The Wildcats were picked to finish eighth in the Big 12 in 2011 and finished second, and were picked to finish sixth last fall but finished first. Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
23. Virginia Tech: The Hokies looks to rebound after winning only seven games, four in the ACC, a season ago. The offense has some depth issues at wide receiver and needs a big year from Logan Thomas. But the defense is one of the best in the ACC and one of the best in the entire country. Douglas Jones, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
22. Northwestern: The Wildcats went 10-3 and won a bowl game in 2012 to enter this season with high confidence. Northwestern has a wonderful amount of talent on offense, especially at quarterback and running back. To win the Big Ten, the Wildcats must beat Nebraska and Michigan during the regular season. Phil Sears, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
21. Northern Illinois: The Huskies remain the clear and undisputed leader in the MAC for another year, coaching change or no, and is once again a major threat for 12 or 13 wins and an at-large BCS bid. Andrew Weber, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
20. Oklahoma State: OSU has offense to spare but a few issues on defense. Is the offense alone good enough to win the Big 12? Maybe, especially if Texas and Oklahoma continue to tread water. But the Cowboys are not a complete team until the defense joins the offense. USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
19. Southern California: USC looks to rebound after a painful 2012 season that began with enormous promise but ended at 7-6, behind UCLA in the Pac-12 South Division. To return to the championship race, the Trojans must find a new starting quarterback and land steady play from more than a dozen underclassmen set to hold major roles on offense and defense. Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
18. Michigan: UM has more than enough talent to win the Big Ten Legends Division and play for a Rose Bowl berth, especially if quarterback Devin Gardner limits his turnovers. But the Wolverines are still very young at several key positions, so developing this youthful talent is the biggest key for the coming season. Rick Osentoski, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
17. LSU: The program hired Cam Cameron as its new offensive coordinator, hoping the former Baltimore Ravens assistant can breathe life into a predictable unit. At the same time, LSU's proud defense faces some questions along the defensive line, which is traditionally a strength. While the Tigers might struggle at times, this team remains a BCS threat. Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
16. Louisville: The Cardinals have the luxury of playing one of the nation's weakest schedules. At the same time, the Cardinals realize one loss will end their championship hopes. Expectations are high, but with coach Charlie Strong and quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, anything is possible. Chuck Cook, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
15. Oklahoma: The Sooners need to settle on a starting quarterback before moving to the defense, which is once again short on bodies along the line. Another issue is the secondary, which must replace three starters. But the team as a whole remains dangerous inside and out of the Big 12. Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
14. Florida: UF has a defense worthy of a national championship but an offense with some major question marks. For example, is quarterback Jeff Driskel ready to take the next step? If so, does he have the receivers to make this passing game click? With a tough schedule, any chance Florida has at playing for the national championship hinges on the growth of this offense. Chuck Cook, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
13. Notre Dame: The Fighting Irish return much of the same team that went 12-1 a season ago but are less explosive on both sides of the ball. To make another charge at the national championship, Notre Dame must land steady play from quarterback Tommy Rees and be equally stout on defense without All-American linebacker Manti Te’o. Matt Cashore, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
12. Texas: The Longhorns should be viewed as the top team in the Big 12 and national championship contenders. Whether UT can finally break out of its slump depends entirely on the play of a defense three or four years removed from its glory days. With the offense turning a corner, the Longhorns’ defense is the lone missing piece of the puzzle. Overall, however, Texas is one of the most experienced teams in the country. Brendan Maloney, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
11. Nebraska: Coach Bo Pelini, a lover of shutouts, leads a team almost wholly defined by its immensely talented offense. It's an offense to love, one with a senior quarterback, a 1,000-yard back, an elite receiver corps and a stout offensive front, but nevertheless – it's an offense, and Pelini viewed offenses with nothing short of disdain for every second of his pre-Nebraska career. Brian Spurlock, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
10. Clemson: The team lost leading receiver DeAndre Hopkins to the NFL in the offseason, but it has Sammy Watkins (shown) -- one of college football's top pass catchers -- back this season. And it also has senior quarterback Tajh Boyd, a legitimate Heisman trophy candidate throwing. That combination has helped Clemson become one of the ACC's top BCS candidates. Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
9. Boise State: Quarterback Joe Southwick outruns two Washington defenders in last year's MAACO Bowl. Boise State enters the 2013 season with Southwick returning as its starting quarterback, which bodes well for the season. The Broncos are 51-2 under coach Chris Petersen in seasons when they've returned their starting QB. Kirby Lee, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
8. Florida State: FSU will lean on some of the nation's best depth to survive losses like quarterback EJ Manuel and defensive ends Bjoern Werner and Tank Carradine, among others. But the Seminoles' recruiting efforts will help this team survive despite the losses, especially on the defensive side of the ball. Keep an eye on redshirt freshman Jameis Winston, the replacement for Manuel at quarterback. Melina Vastola, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
7. Texas AM: Johnny Manziel alone makes this offense one of the nation's best. In addition to the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, however, Texas A&M has one of the nation's best tackles in Jake Matthews, a superb backfield and some of the best talent receiver talent in the FBS. What's separating A&M from Alabama is a defense, though the Aggies could score enough points to top the Crimson Tide and all comers to win the program's first national title since 1939. Troy Taormina, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
6. Georgia: This team has one of the nation's best offenses but must replace nine starters on defense. In a nightmare scenario, Georgia scores enough points to go undefeated but loses two or more games due ot an inability to stop opponents like Clemson, South Carolina and Florida. But if the young defense clicks, Georgia can win the national championship. John David Mercer, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
5. South Carolina: This team has the schedule, talent, coaching and experience to win the SEC East Division and play for the conference championship. To get there, however, the Gamecocks need to land a healthy season from quarterback Connor Shaw. The defense, led by Jadeveon Clowney, will be one of the nation's best. Curtis Wilson, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
4. Oregon: This team will remain among the elite programs in college football despite a coaching change, with former offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Mark Helfrich replacing Chip Kelly. The offense will continue to roll behind quarterback Marcus Mariota, running back De’Anthony Thomas and a seasoned offensive line. The defense is raw at linebacker but could have the nation’s best secondary. The season comes down to Oregon’s trip to Stanford in November. Scott Olmos, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
3. Ohio State: Urban Meyer set a shot across the bow of the rest of the Big Ten, the SEC and the entire FBS, rapidly moving OSU out of a short lull and back into the national championship conversation. After a 12-0 stance in 2012, what's next? Perhaps better results in 2013, as the Buckeyes bring back their core. QB Braxton Miller is a Heisman hopeful. Andrew Weber, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
2. Stanford: David Shaw's Cardinal have wonderful depth at every position. That, along with quarterback Kevin Hogan's growth, the line's continued improvement, the awesome front seven and wonderful secondary, makes Stanford one of the top teams in the FBS. Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY SportsFullscreen
1. Alabama: Alabama is the pick to win the 2013 national championship. Don't act surprised. While sliding in new faces at some new spots, the Crimson Tide are stocked, locked and loaded, ready for another run, ready to again plant its flag amid a shower of confetti in January. Don't be surprised. Alabama is again the nation's best team, against coached better than anyone, again propelled forward by wonderful leadership and again defined by its ability to put forward the sort of consistently balanced effort needed to throttle every opponent in its path. This team is no worse than last year's version; it's better in many areas, in fact, and extremely motivated to secure a unique spot in college football history.
