TWEETCOMMENTEMAILMOREThe first word: Eastern Kentucky enters the 2013-14 season as the most experienced team in the Ohio Valley Conference, bringing back four starters from last season's record-setting team. The Colonels' turnaround season — school-best 25 wins and the first postseason victory in 68 years — was the first step in coach Jeff Neubauer's ultimate goal of bringing EKU to the NCAA tournament.FULL COUNTDOWN: Projecting the field of 68On paper, Eastern Kentucky will be the favorite because of its returning talent, but it's so often underestimated how much a league such as the OVC can change based on the influx of highly rated junior college transfers and younger players stepping up. For instance, the Colonels were picked to finish second to last in the OVC last preseason but rattled off nine consecutive wins to start the season before finishing with the second-best overall record in the the league.And even though four starters come back, EKU might have lost its best player in senior point guard Mike DiNunno (14.8 ppg, 4.3 apg) who facilitated much, if not all, of the team's offense last season with the ball in his hands most of ever game. Still, Neubauer has reason for optimism as OVC all-newcomer guards Glenn Cosey and Corey Walden are completely capable of spearheading an offense.2012-13 in review: 25-10 overall, 12-4 (second place in OVC), lost in CollegeInsider.com Tournament (CIT) to Evansville.Tournament projection: No. 13 seed.Path to the dance: Win the OVC tournament to take league's automatic bid. Belmont last season had a high RPI and probably would have earned an at-large bid had it not beaten Murray State in the final. But it's a rarity for the OVC to send two teams to the NCAAs; the last time it happened was 1987.Conference outlook: EKU plays in the toughest side of the conference, the East Division, where Belmont probably will challenge despite losing its top two players in Ian Clark and Kerron Johnson. Also in that division, Morehead State is poised for an improved season under Sean Woods, and Tennessee State has the top player in the conference in Patrick Miller (14.8 ppg, 5.8 apg). In the West Division, Murray should again be good even though Isaiah Canaan is gone. Austin Peay could play spoiler.STARTING FIVE: Top story lines for 2013-14Quote to note: "If I was picking teams to be in the NCAA tournament before the season, I'd pick Eastern Kentucky to win the Ohio Valley." — Belmont coach Rick ByrdCoach's corner: "We won 25 games last year. So what? To make that huge step to get to the NCAA tournament, we need to get better. We took a big step. Now it's time to take another." — Neubauer, who's coached at EKU since 2005 and is a former West Virginia assistant.Star watch: The backcourt of Cosey (15.2 ppg, 3.2 apg) and Corey Walden (13.0 ppg, 3.5 rpg) give the Colonels two dynamic catalysts to drive the offense.Role players: Guard Tarius Johnson (6.6 ppg, 4.2 rpg) and forward Eric Stutz (8.3 ppg, 4.7 rpg) are also key returners. Stutz finished the season strong — averaging 15.8 points and 6.3 rebounds in four postseason games. Marcus Lewis is another guard who distinguishes himself with jump-out-of-the-gym abilities.X-factor: Miami (Ohio) transfer Orlando Williams only played 12 games last season because of injury and NCAA transfer rules, averaging 7.2 points. If he's healthy and can provide a spark, less pressure will be put on EKU's top backcourt players.Team strength/weakness: Last season the team fed off its defense to lead to easy baskets, and that will need to again be a strength for EKU to win the OVC. The team's biggest weakness could come early with finding a new team identity without DiNunno. The Colonels will need to establish the right formula in the non-conference season. Neubauer thinks the Colonels might have more of an in-and-out game this year but still expects lots of high ball screens.Basics: Eastern Kentucky University is in Richmond, Ky. and plays home games at McBrayer Arena, which has the world's longest wooden laminated cross-arched roof.Tournament history: EKU has seven NCAA tournament appearances in its history, last playing in 2007. The Colonels have never won a game in the Big Dance, however.Trivia: ABC Good Morning America weather man Sam Champion is an EKU graduate.About this post: Every weekday, one of the 68 teams in USA TODAY Sports' projected NCAA tournament field will be dissected.
