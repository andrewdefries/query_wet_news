COMMENTEMAILMOREFOXBOROUGH, Mass. – According to the official Gillette Stadium game clock, the New York Jets lost their cool with 38 seconds remaining in a winnable battle they let slip away against a frustrated Tom Brady.Jets center Nick Mangold tackled New England Patriots cornerback Aqib Talib below the knees on the Patriots sideline following Geno Smith's third fourth-quarter interception in Thursday night's 13-10 loss to the vulnerable-looking 2-0 Patriots.BOX SCORE: Patriots 13, Jets 10Mangold's tackle ignited a wild melee that ended with left tackle D'Brickashaw Ferguson and guard Willie Colon getting ejected."Mangold tried to make a tackle, he goes to try and take the guy, the guy turned his back, he went into the back of his legs – and it wasn't intentional,'' Jets coach Rex Ryan said. "He just tried to make a cut tackle. He went out of bounds. And then all heck broke loose apparently. And our team was the only one involved in it.''Mangold was surprised Patriots coach Bill Belichick lit into him."I figured he would have had more poise than that,'' Mangold said. "I find it hard to believe that we were the only ones who got ejected. We played a hard-fought game. But turnovers killed us.''EX-JETS QB: Sanchez injury blessing in disguiseThat's because the 1-1 Jets truly lost it when Smith reverted to rookie form with his three-interception, fourth-quarter meltdown. It began with the first of two ill-advised throws intercepted by Talib.On third-and-5 from the New England 27-yard line with 11:22 remaining, his team trailing by the final margin, Smith had his Mark Sanchez red-zone implosion.PHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 2FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInBest of NFL Week 2 FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Cornerback Kyle Arrington deflected Smith's pass and Talib intercepted it. That snuffed the Jets' best last chance to score either the go-ahead touchdown or tying field goal."I just made a decision that ultimately cost my team,'' Smith said. "We came out, competed hard. But with the mistakes that were completely on me, we didn't get it done.''The former West Virginia star finished 15 of 35 for 214 yards with a 27.6 passer rating."I don't like to look at this as a learning experience because I think I'm ready for this,'' Smith said. "I know I'm ready for this. And I've got to take care of the ball. I've got to give us a chance to win.''PREDICTIONS: USA TODAY Sports' Week 2 picksThe Jets are starting over with Smith now that incumbent starter Mark Sanchez's dislocated throwing shoulder requires surgery. Sanchez declined to discuss his condition with reporters afterward.Though Sanchez said Thursday he will try to rehab his dislocated right shoulder, a person close to him told USA TODAY Sports that eventually Sanchez will need surgery on the shoulder, and it's likely to land him on season-ending injured reserve.Thursday night's game was there for the taking for New York. Rookie defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson heard disgust hissing from Brady after each dropped pass or missed scoring connection with his injury-depleted cast of pass catchers. With his receivers whittled by free agency and injuries to a group of unproven rookies, Brady longed for the trusted hands of Wes Welker, Rob Gronkowski and Danny Amendola. When wide open rookie receiver Aaron Dobson turned the wrong way in the end zone on what should have been a 12-yard, second-quarter touchdown, Brady clapped his hands to his helmet and screamed.<!--iframe comment-->The Patriots converted just 4 of 18 third downs."The defense was tremendous; we kept Tom Brady off the field,'' Richardson said. "He was throwing balls to the ground, they were dropping passes. He was frustrated.''There was good reason. Amendola and running back Shane Vereen (broken wrist), who combined to catch 17 of Brady's 28 completions in Sunday's win against Buffalo, sat out with injuries.At another point, Brady slammed his helmet to the ground when he returned to the bench following another sloppy series."I have to do a better job with my body language,'' Brady said. "I definitely can improve that. I wouldn't say it's a real strong point of mine right now. We'll just try to keep doing better.''Tom Brady throwing a tantrum against the Jets.(Photo: Jim Rogash, Getty Images)When Talib's second interception sealed the game, Ferguson and Colon lost it far worse than Brady. They could face stiff fines from the league office.Ferguson was ejected for throwing a punch at Wilfork, while Colon bumped an official."I hope I don't get suspended,'' Colon said. "I hope it is not the case. I lost my temper. I lost my cool out there, and we can't have it. It hurts your team, and I know better.''Ferguson only knew that he got ejected, not the reason why as he walked to the team bus afterward."I don't really remember what happened, I just know at the end of that I got ejected,'' Ferguson told USA TODAY Sports.Ryan was asked about at least six drops by Smith's receivers, including a fumble by Stephen Hill that set up Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski's first of two field goals."We've got to hang onto the football,'' Ryan said. "Would it have changed the outcome? I don't know. But I would have liked to have found out.''SHARE
