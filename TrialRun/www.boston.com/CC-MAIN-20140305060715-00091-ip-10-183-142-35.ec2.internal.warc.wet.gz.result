In Response to Re: Trade value on Thomas may be at its peak!!!:[QUOTE]Here's a good idea. List all the teams that: 1- Need a goalie. 2- Can afford him (have cap space, or the willingness to pay it) 3- Are not a serious threat to the B's come playoff time with TT in net. 4- Have something the Bruins really, really need, with little to no impact on the B's own Cap problems. Once you've done that, you see what kind of market there really is. Not much.Posted by perrysound[/QUOTE]QFT, especially the bolded part. So many cockamamie trade proposals made without knowledge or recognition of the realities of the salary cap.

And PBergeron. Where you said if Crosby was offered for Thomas! That's where Shero would lose his job! Not only is that non-debatable, it's completely unrealistic. In sports anybody can be traded. What I'm saying is even with Thomas at his peak. The B's would not be able to get someone as valuable to them as TT is to them. He's on pace to win 3 to 4 trophy's this year. The Conn Smythe being the most important. The B's will NEVER get the value. I already said this past summer that if a Jeff Carter, Bobby Ryan, Getzlaf type player came knocking? That's an investment that PC would have to take a look at. None of these players would be offered & that's the value TT is worth right now!NAS, Bookboy, Sandog & Legion say something about this foolish talk will ya's! Make these people listen to reason!

Slim, you are so right. I am actually mad at myself. BUt I can't stand 'internet tough guys' who think they can control when people respond or write on a message board....I'll leave it alone now though so we can actually talk BC sports.

In Response to Re: ACC vs. Big East Basketball:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: ACC vs. Big East Basketball : they will be fine... unlike the BC teamPosted by Donnnn[/QUOTE]I actually think that BC will be fine, too, in two years. Next year, they could be a .500 team, but I think that the following year, if they stay together, they'll be pretty good. I look at what Tom Crean did with Indiana. After Knight was fired in 2000, they had Mike Davis. Kelvin Sampson, Dan Dakich, then Crean. It's taken Crean 4 years (6-25, 10-21-12-20) to rebuild to where they are today. Skinner did it at BC when Jim O'Brien left after the dispute with admissions. Skinner went 15-16, 6-21, 11-19, 27-5 and a BE Championship. I think it will happen again.

Vereen had 160 all-purpose yards, on 20 touches. To be frank ... unless it's game plan/situation specific, I think he should be the offensive centerpiece until Gronk gets back. You have chosen to ignore posts from BabeParilli.

First: Last: Did Francona leave him in too long? I say yes. Beckett is healthy but remember he has a history of being injured. This is only April. Wouldn’t it be prudent not to start running up the pitch count so early in the year. This is a marathon. We want a healthy Beckett in October. The 125 pitches was one fewer than his career high of 126, which came when he was with the Marlins in 2004. In fact this was only the ninth time in his career he has thrown 120 or more pitches in a regular season game, fourth time since coming to the Red Sox before the 2006 season. Furthermore, since Terry Francona became manager of the Red Sox, only four pitchers have thrown more pitches in a game than Beckett did Thursday night: Lester threw 130 in his no-hitter against the Royals on May 19, 2008; Matsuzaka threw 126 and 129 in starts 17 days apart in 2007, and 39-year-old Schilling threw 133 on April 25, 2006 in Cleveland. Francona should have pulled Beckett after he completed the seventh inning having thrown 107 pitches. Francona should stick to his customary practice and not overextend his starting pitching staff.

Do you have to complain about everything - if he took him out and bard or jenks got hit - you would be complaing about taking him out to early.

First: Last: It will help to remedy the downfall to do the following:1- They need more offense, since it is difficult to make a trade in the waivers, and expensive, it will help if the use Ellisbury, he is hot now, and he can hit an run, he will help instead of playing WIlly Mo o Hinske, or to give a dayoff to Coco Crisp, and will give the offense and upgrade. Also when Big Papi cannot go, put Manny on DH, and Ellisbury on the field.The sox played well then he was on the team.2- The way Gagne is throwing the ball, is better to return the way the bullpen was used before the trade Papelbon is great, Okahima is pitching great, Timlin has been doing good lately, the same for Delcarmen. Do not use Gagne in close games, so he can fix himself and return to the way he can pitch.3- I would like to see Buckholtz, I read he was leading all the minors in strikeout, he could help, I am hoping it they promote it to pitch friday in Boston.4- it will be nice to get another bat, but not at the expense of Buckholtz, Ellisbury or the other grate prospects.

Everything is going wrong now and when that happens we tend to magnify all the little chips and dents and bruises that we've seen all year long. We always knew that Francona wasn't the brightest light in the outhouse but when he takes out Okijima to put in Gagne, and then disaster strikes ... it stands out as a monumental blunder. We all knew that Theo was a one-year-wonder so when he opts to disrupt the pecking order of an allready excellent bullpen and ignores the glaring need for more offensive production ... it once again stands out as a monumental blunder. So, once again, here we are. The lead has shrunk to four games and, following another brief homestand lurks another lengthy (10 games) roadtrip. And, while the lead slips away into oblivion and the going-wrong becomes even more going-wronger ... we must sit by and watch: Francona throwing old Willy Moe into line-up for more k's and misjudged fly balls Gagne becoming a 'lets save the ten run lead' late-in-the-game pitcher. Okijima's increased unhappiness with being relegated to the sidelines. Tina lobbing softball questions to Terry after another series of mis-managed ballgames; Jerry and Don ignoring the game and trading jokes with one another; and, sad to say, another couple of Stadium and Fenway massacres by the charging Yankees. Oh, the life of a Red Sox fan. What-to-do, what-to-do, what-to-do?

Sorry dude, but the Yankees played an over .500 team on the road this weekend and the Red Sox are the ones who played a crappy team. Yankees swept and the Red Sox lost 2.Also, everyone forgets what the Yankees pitching staff was like at the beginning of the year with the likes of Chase Wright filling out the rotation.

Controversy is brewing over the recent New York times op ed: A terrifying way to discipline children, in which Bill Lichtenstein describes his five-year-old daughter being held in a seclusion room at a Lexington school when her behavior was out of control. A Globe headline asserts in response: Account of putting pupil in isolation disputed. Of course I do not know what actually happened. However, I do know that a very commonly held belief among parents is that one should leave a child alone, or "ignore" him, when he is having a meltdown. Yet all of the best of developmental science tell us that this approach is completely wrong.When I work with families who are struggling with a child's out-of-control behavior, I explain that in the middle of a meltdown, a child feels completely helpless. If left alone, he will feel not only frightened, but also abandoned. I explain that at such a moment, the higher cortical centers of the brain responsible for rational thought are not functioning properly.These types of severe meltdowns are common in children who have experience early trauma, at the time when the higher cortical centers of the brain were not yet fully developed. Stress of a seemingly minor nature can lead the rational brain to in a sense go "off-line." The child will have access only to the lower brain centers that function more instinctively.I recall working with the parents of a four-year-old child who had been adopted from another country. There he had lived on the street with his mentally ill mother, from whom he had been separated at one year of age and placed in an orphanage. His adoptive parents where both horrified and overwhelmed by what they interpreted as "anger." He would scream at them, spit at them, kick and hit them. Not only would they get angry in return, interpreting his behavior as "defiant," but they would send him to his room, saying, "I'll be back when you can calm down and behave nicely."When I explained that during a meltdown he was developmentally more like a newborn than a four- year-old, their approach to him completely changed. Rather than react in anger, they would ask calmly, "Do you need a hug?" Or they would try to hold him. If he were too out-of-control to allow physical contact, they would take him to a place where he was physically safe, and speak to him reassuringly until he began to calm down. Not only did the tantrums subside, but his parents began to learn to recognize when he was about to descend into what they now understood as a lower center of brain function. They would try to engage him when the thinking part of his brain was still working.Similar mechanisms are at play in a child who has not had this kind of severe trauma. Frequent meltdowns are common in the setting of sensory processing problems and developmental problems such as speech and language delay (as apparently was the case for Rose, the child described the New York Times piece.) When a child is repeatedly abandoned both physically and emotionally in the middle o
