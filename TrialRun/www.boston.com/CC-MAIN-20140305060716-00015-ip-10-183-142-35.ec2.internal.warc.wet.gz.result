Boston Symphony Orchestra music director James Levine will miss the remainder of the summer season at Tanglewood to have a kidney removed.His condition, due to a cyst "causing pressure and discomfort," will require six weeks of recuperation, and he hopes to be ready to conduct the BSO's season opening at Symphony Hall in the fall, the orchestra announced in a statement yesterday.The BSO said the Tanglewood schedule, which called for Levine to conduct eight more concerts, will continue as planned. Assistant conductor Julian Kuerti will take Levine's place Sunday afternoon in a concert featuring pianist Peter Serkin. Other conductors will be announced as they are lined up.<
