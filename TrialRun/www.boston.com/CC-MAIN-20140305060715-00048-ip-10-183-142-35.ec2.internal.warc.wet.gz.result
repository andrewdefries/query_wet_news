LinkedIn is the professional way to connect and get found. It has over 161 million registered users in over 200 countries and territories, with new users signing up at a rate of approximately 2 per second. Linkedin users tend to be of higher income level, are over 35 years of age, and are typically the decision makers. Linkedin is a leader for B2B, headhunters and recruiters.
Google holds LinkedIn in high regard; if you Google your name, you’ll likely find your Linkedin profile within the first page of those results. And we know 80% of searches take place on Google. So you want your profile to be polished and ready to go!
Much like the spiders that Google, Bing and Yahoo use to match keywords to search queries, LinkedIn is also looking to give their users a great experience by connecting them to the right people. Linkedin searches only certain sections within a profile; let’s make sure those are enhanced and are primed to show the world you’re an expert.
The Basics:
1. Put an image up. Nothing is worse than a profile that’s neglected, so upload a great image and make your digital resume stand out. Use an image that shows your face, not too casual, think professional and flattering. Higher quality professional images are best.
2. Your title is very important. Utilize this position by making it keyword dense.
3. Think through your current & past work experience. Remember it is a story.
4. Summary is your chance to connect with visitors. Spend some time and make it sticky. More about this below.
5. Headline is very important. Think keyword keyword keyword!
6. Sign up for Industry Groups. Post specifically to them, and make conversation. 7. Update your profile with targeted information. Sign in at least twice a week, daily if you’ve got the hustle.
The basics can land you many a lead or job offer, but if you really want to light it up, read on…
Content: Some LinkedIn accounts are a cut above the rest because they think about engaging their viewers, not just posting a resume. The copy should read much like a website would, a consistent cadence or voice and be sure to clearly define what you do. Tell us what can you do for us, and what do you want us, the reader, to do. Remember to customize all of the copy for your target audience with likely search terms for your industry.
Connect: Groups are a powerful way to introduce new ideas, ask questions and drum up unparalleled industry specific conversation. You can utilize groups to chat and gather information, but once you begin contributing is when the magic begins.
A lot of folks recommend that you make your own group. I think that depends on what you do and how much time you have. I prefer to participate in other people’s groups. And I find most of my clients are too busy to add another task like that to their plate. I suggest you jump in and see what works for you.
Contribute: Go for the Gold! Get in the conversation. You’ve joined some groups, and you’ve listened for a while. Now it’s your turn to jump in.
Share your content. Whatever you’re producing is game: your Blog, Video, a PowerPoint presentation, new product launch, a great quote, or simply an idea you want feedback on. This is when you’ll start to make deeper connections. And with these connections you can invite them to give feedback or even share an article of yours. This isn’t an avenue for sales, think industry secrets, tips and

I'm pregnant with my second, and for several reasons, I'm hoping to do take a hybrid nursing/formula approach. I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this arrangement, or any tips to share? Thanks!

So, we all saw the thread of 10 most hated hockey players. I want to see who YOU, the fan, hates the most. Now its tough to hate someone, when you really dont know them, but lets hear who you hate, because of their style of play and the way they act.
My most hated player, is Scott Hartnell. Something about him, just makes me want to see one of the Bruins or any player for that matter, beat his arse. Oh and the hair style is the worst in the league.

I am generally very supportive of my team, players, manager and front office. But right now I am livid about what happened on August 18, 2013. Last night's game just may have put more stupidity on display than any single game in history. This game had it all, a bonanza of baseball boneheadedness. It wasn't just the Red Sox who were stupid. All the parties played their role. Start with the fact that the game was played on a Sunday night with the Red Sox having to fly to San Francisco for a game the next night. Add in the fact that Red Sox-Yankee games often last about 4 hours, like this one did. That covers the commercialism and greed angle. Next we have the A-Rod circus. Here is the guy who is presumably the biggest offender in the Biogenesis situation. All the other lesser players have been suspended without a fight. And here's A-Rod still playing. Here's A-Rod's lawyers blasting the Yankees and the Yankees firing back. It seems like the Yankees wish A-Rod was gone. But there he is playing. Now here's The Red Sox, an aggrieved party to all of the above. So how do they handle things? By making things worse. Let's bean A-Rod. Sure, I can see why they would want to do that. But let's wait till the worst possible time to do it. Let's wait till the third game of the series. Let's do it when we have a good chance of winning. Let's do it when our starting pitcher risks getting thrown out of the game early so we can fry our bullpen. Best of all, let's fire up A-Rod and the Yankees so they can beat us and make us look like idiots. You have chosen to ignore posts from SFBostonFan.

Best of all, let's fire up A-Rod and the Yankees so they can beat us and make us look like idiots. ====================================== Many, many posts about our play last night, the plunking, leaving Dempster in etc. but yours, in my opinion, is the best ! Regarding scheduling it is a beautiful day in SF but might be foggy & cool tonight. Giants too flew 6 hours from Miami but as had a day game got here last night while we had a very late unhappy ending game. Monday morning quarterback but we'd been better off if Ump had tossed Dempster after the plunk ! Wow, our guys need start play with little rest with body clocks at 10:15 EST. I did same in Military but I was in my early 20s. Many of these guys are not youngsters. OH well, hope we take at least 2 out of 3. You have chosen to ignore posts from Hammah29r2.

First: Last: What are some of the longest cruiser trails in N.E.?I just returned to skiing after 4 years and 2 injuries, and find that I now prefer the long effortless cruisers to the more active/advanced terrain. What I don't like is a 10 min ride up the lift for a 2 min trip down the hill.
