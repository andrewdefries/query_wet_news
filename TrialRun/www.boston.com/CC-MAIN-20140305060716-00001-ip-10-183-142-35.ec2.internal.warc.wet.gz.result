That is a good question. He can play but can he contribute to a NBA team. He looked awful the first year and broke out in the Spring of 2012 only to return to Earth last year and managed to not be much of a factor last year. He can defend and it appeared for a while he could score, but teams backed off and took the backdoor away from him and forced him to shoot under pressure. This worked and his confidence fell off a cliff last year. Will a new offence designed to take advantage of his strengths help. Yes, thank goodness we have a coach this year that will try to get his best players their best shots. Doc became so predictable last year that his club was easy to defend because everybody knew what we were going to do. Players like Randolph that could have helped us rotted on the bench. The ball will move this year and the players will move, looking for pentetration and passes to open teammates. Rondo will be more invo

3.2 innings, 9 hits, 7runs (5 earned), 2 BBs, and 2 HRs (bombs) late in his stint. Not to belabor the obvious but this experiment hasn't worked well recently. Often he was behind in the count but what troubled me most last night was: when he did throw strikes he threw them right in the middle of the plate and they were mashed. My sense is that Theo really has to make a move for a new 5th starter before the trading deadline comes and goes.

Miller is pitching scared. Each outing seems worse than the last one and I think he's trying so hard not to make mistakes that he's making things worse. He needs to calm down and remember that it is OK to pitch to contact if you defense can help you get outs and his defense can.

My take is that the RS are not going to be "saved" by a deadline trade for a starter. The season but even more so the post season largely depends on Buch being able to return and Lackey's recent performances being sustainable. I just don't think the answer is in the deadline market.But I concur that the recent outings do suggest that Andrew Miller still has plenty of issues with control. Even in his early successful appearances the walks did not seem eliminated just mitigated. You have chosen to ignore posts from moonslav59.
