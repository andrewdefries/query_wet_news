The nor’easter was expected to dump a wet blanket on southern counties and a fluffier covering in the west, according to the National Weather Service in Taunton.The weather service said the storm could produce blizzard conditions, especially in the early morning.“We’re expecting this is going to have a huge impact on the morning commute,’’ said Peter Judge,
