Once they can roll over consistently from back to tummy, then there is not much you can do but it means they are strong enough to get their head to the side to breathe. Usually babies can roll from tummy to back long before they roll from back to tummy, so they should be able to roll back to their back. I do believe though once the baby can roll from back to tummy and you are swaddling them, that you need to stop swaddling them since they need to be able to have use of their arms to get themselves into a better position if they rolled over awkwardly. This includes any swaddle sacks you use. We are using the Woombie (one brand of swaddle sack) and I know as soon as she shows she can roll from back to front, that we will have to transition to the arms out woombie and/or sleep sacks with arms out and free. You still want to keep the crib clear of toys, blankets and bumpers - suffocation risks are still present if they roll and trap themselves (especially with bumpers) and can not free themselves when their air is cut off. This is why even those mesh things to keep the babies from climbing out makes me cringe - they have the same risks. Note - in that same vein - if you did not see that major recall of the peapod travel bed for infants, please be sure to follow up on that if you own one. We got one but never used it for some reason, and after that recall, we plan to junk it since it makes us way too nervous even with their repair kit to trust it won't be a safety hazard.

[/QUOTE]She's been unswaddled since around 12 weeks, so we're good with that. We use the A+A sleeping "bags". I know she's super strong but that doesn't lessen my worries, ya know? I've never seen that travel bed before- why is it being recalled? PS- there's an edit button now? Have I been blind and not seen it til just now?!

The peapod travel bed is recalled after a 5 month old twin died when he was put in one for a nap. It appears the baby got his head wedged between the air mattress and tent side. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/16/pea-pod-travel-crib-recall_n_2143489.html I don't know it ever gets easier with worrying - DS is two and we sometimes check on him to be sure we can feel or hear him breathing especially at nap time if he is sleeping longer than usual. DD is a noiser baby so we can hear her during the night so it is easier to listen for her when i wake up at night and worry about her. You have chosen to ignore posts from poppy609.

Congrats, Luv! How exciting. You will love having all that extra space (well, except when it comes to vacuuming. I had to send both kids to babysitters yesterday in order to vacuum the whole house). DS is 4 months today and still waking every 2 hours all night long to eat. I'm wondering if he'd wake less if he didn't sleep a foot away from me. Has anyone ever experienced a baby waking less if moved to his/her own room? I'm hesitant to actually commit to doing it because I really don't want to have to get out of bed and go into another room to feed him 4x per night, when right now I can just roll over. But if I had some glimmer of hope that it might help, I would try it...
