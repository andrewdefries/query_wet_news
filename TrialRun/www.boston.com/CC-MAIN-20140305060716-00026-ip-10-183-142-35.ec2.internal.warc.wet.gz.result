In response to realdfury13's comment: In response to snakeoil123's comment: In response to realdfury13's comment: In response to SeemsToMe's comment: Using the ring to determine the degree of greatness. Russ 11--Wilt 2 Sanders 8--Baylor1 KC Jones 8-- West 1 S Jones 10-- Robertson 1 Heinsohn 8-- Pettit 1 Many years ago I also used the RING to prove that Russ was better than Wilt. I also used the RING to prove that the Yankee Clipper was better than Ted Williams and Mantle was better than Willie mays. As the years passed I was able to tone down my Favorite Team bias and take a more detached view of the players. Perhaps my view on this matter changed during the Bird-Magic years when the ring count favored Magic over Bird. Absolutely nothing wrong with being a loyal, passionate, fan of your favorite team. Been there,done that but I guess that old age has mellowed my views to a great extent. I always enjoy these posts on player comparisons as well as post on the old timers vs the present day players and teams. Keep them coming. Seems Robert Horry - 7 rings Charles Barkley - 0 rings Karl Malone - 0 rings Robert Horry - 7 rings. Nash- 0 rings. Howard- o rings. I like this game. All current Celtics: 4 rings Kobe (#4 all-time scorer) 5 rings Wow I had no idea. So Horry is the best of all, then comes kobe and then Terry is better than Nash or Howard. This is all really fascinating.

All current Celtics: 4 rings Kobe (#4 all-time scorer) 5 rings Gifted ring by refs in 2010. Garnett injured in 2009. Shaq wins three rings in a row without the help of Kobe. As Shaq said then we could have won those three rings with Pierce. You have chosen to ignore posts from KingShaq.
