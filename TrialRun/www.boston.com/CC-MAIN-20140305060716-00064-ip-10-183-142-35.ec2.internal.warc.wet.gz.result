I have never been a Rondo hater, but I have criticized him in the past, and have even suggested they play Nate over Rondo towards the end of the game, but now..., I have change my mind, Rondo should always be in there at the start, and the end of games. I admit, his absense, has shed new light to me, and now I realize how great of a floor general that he is. All hail ROndo!!!

Rondo played perfect tonight,and he passed up alot of open shots to get Ray and Big Baby and others going. They shot 61 percent,because he gets everyone involved and easier shots.

YESSSS.. but more than ever i think he has a shooting issue... thus, like tonight at the end, would still have preferred a delonte in there to close it out. rondo runs away from the ball for he can tshoot free throws. that turnover by nate was a great example, same with pierce one.. i want delonte coming for the ball in those situations and going confidently to the line as a 80 percent foul shooter. rondo cant do that!

Heard this on the radio:
Look at playoff history. Most teams don't score over 30 points for all their games. Not even the greatest offenses. Last team to do it was in 2009 were the Saints, and in the NFC champ game it took OT to get to 30, and a pick 6 in the Super Bowl to reach 30.
Greatest show on turf failed to score over 24 in the NFC championship and Super Bowl (11 points and 23 points respectively). They scored 49 during the divisional round.
2010 Packers went 21, 48, 21, 31.
2008 Cardinals went 30, 33, 32, 27
2007 Patriots went 31, 21, 14
2011 Patriots went 45, 23, 17
Not saying history predicts the future. But it's interesting considering we're in an era that is more offense based. Whether it be defenses have figured out offenses by seasons end or refs don't call as many penalties, I don't know. Divisional round seems to be where the offensive explosions occur. Patriots haven't scored 30 over the Ravens since 1996, and theyre now without their best red zone weapon.
I'm picking the Patriots to win, but I think it's going to be extremely close. I also think it will be a game in the 20's as it usually is. I'm surprised that so many people are picking the patriots to score in the 30's when not only Patriots history, but NFL history in general points to them not scoring 30+. Of course, teams are meant to break trends and this Patriots could be that team. I hope I'm wrong and the Patriots win 52-0, in honor of Ray Lewis, but being realistic, I don't see it.
Can't solely win this game on offense. Still takes complete teams. I think this will be a Talib, Wilfork, Spikes, Nink game.

According the Ravens' fans, they will score 30+ and keep the Pats lower. Who knows... 20 - 30 - 40 - 50, as long as it is one point more than the other team, it means a WIN!! Winning big just means more bragging for some fans and those that picked it.

As long as the Pats have one more point (but I think they'll need to score 30 at the least)

In response to pumpsie-green's comment:Its not a better place when religious zealots attempt to perpetrate their bigoted viewpoints on citizens who have been discriminated against for years Zac. That only perpetuates bigotry in this country. Our founding fathers didn't set the country up to be run by religious laws, fortunately. But thats exactly what 67 is proposing. It won't make us a better place at all. I hear U mr greenwhile I try hard not to get into these personal deep topics here let me say this IMO just because one goes to far in a debate it doesn't automatically mean their good points lose all merit personally I frown on gay pride night just as i do/would on Irish, Italian or PR pride night rather see people celebrate what we have in common

Pitching is upsetting timing.- Warren Spahn It’s not how hard you practice when somebody is watching, it’s how hard you practice when nobody is watching. Hitler was trying to make the world a better place by getting rid of a group of people he didn't like. Hate is hate plain and simple. [/QUOTE]So you are comparing my christian beliefs to the beliefs of hitler, really? Hate is a strong word and should not be thrown around so easily. Do I say you hate christians? Do you want to get rid of christians, then does that make you like hitler? [/QUOTE]OK....you really need to stop hiding behind your Bible. Why don't you really tell us what YOUR opinion is on this? Does your Bible tell you what your opinion should be on all topics? Mine doesn't..... For the love of GOD...think for yourself. So please tell us your REAL issue on this... Do you think it's yucky? Do you not like people who are 'different' then you? Are you 89 years old? Do you think all homosexual men or women (no idea on your gender) find you irresistable? Here's a thought....let people live there lives, let a business do what they want to do. It doesn't mean you have to like it...but remember, you're not the final 'jusdge'. That job is somebody elses and I'm pretty sure he'd be ticked off if he knew you were trying to do his work.....
