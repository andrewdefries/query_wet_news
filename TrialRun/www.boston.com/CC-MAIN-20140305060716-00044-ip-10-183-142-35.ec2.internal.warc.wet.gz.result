by Gordon Edes/ESPNMatsuzaka can't blame injuries. He can't hide behind being out of shape. Or the ball being different in Japan. Or America being different from Japan. The Red Sox have been beyond patient with him and afforded him every advantage, from masseur to chef to interpreter, plane tickets and town car and housing allowance. He has an agent whose menu of services, from physical conditioning to psychological counseling, is without rival, and if he has not availed himself of those services, that's on him. He can't accuse the Sox of trying to Americanize him because then we should accuse them of doing the same with every Latin kid who has ever come here to play ball, too. The difference in pitching in Japan, where you pitch once a week, and in the big leagues, where you take the mound once every five days, is like the difference between college ball and the big leagues. He had a pitching coach who studied Japanese before he got here so that he could talk to him, and a catcher who put in countless hours of study so that he could do for him what he tries to do for every pitcher on the staff: make him better. And when Jason Varitek sat down with him, the message was not, "This is how you do it" but "What do you want to do?'' The next time he walks by a mirror, Matsuzaka should remember that and ask himself what has he tried to do in the past five years to signal to his teammates a desire to fit in, to talk with them, to at least be accessible enough that his manager, Terry Francona, no longer laments he can't even have a casual conversation with him without the use of an interpreter. Do you think the blame for Dice-K’s struggles falls squarely on his shoulders, or should the Red Sox be more accommodating and just let Dice-K be Dice-K?

Do you agree?:[QUOTE]bottom line is perhaps he's just isn't as good as we thought he'd be and certainly it's all on him...Posted by Beantowne[/QUOTE]I disagree, its not HIS fault he was never as good as OWNERSHIP thought he was. Thats ownerships fault for signing a player who goes out and pitches every 5th day but is really just a marketing tool in Asia. You have chosen to ignore posts from SpacemanEephus.

I don't see the point of taking him to task. No, he hasn't been as good as advertised. But, I don't see or hear him making excuses or spinning anything. He has been straight up about his failures and his dissapointment in letting the club down. I agree with Jamesey that, if anything, the FO can be taken to task for shelling out the 50 million dollar posting fee (since his salary is actually about right on value for his production over these past 4 years). I also take the fan base to task for believing the hype to the point that they are just so enraged and judgemental that he has not performed up to the lofty expectations. He wouldn't be the first pitcher to have a couple solid years and then flame out. But, to apply these totally conjectural negative attitudes to Matsuzaka is just piling on b*tching about him, when it is not necessary. He has not performed well for the past 2 seasons. Period. Why all the venom? Unecessary.

He's being made a scapegoat by the media and many of the fans here.The problem with the Sox is no more the fault of Dice-K than Youk. This team oveall su.cks right now and virtually everyone needs to be held accountable.

Political Circuit
If this desk could talk ...
E-mail|Link|Comments ()
January 29, 2010 06:45 PM
By Andrew Ryan, Globe Staff
Politics can be a funny business, full of delectable little ironies that can make even the most jaded partisan smile. Take this story from freshly minted City Councilor Felix G. Arroyo, who this week showed off his new office at City Hall.
"We know that the last city councilor to actually use the desk was Councilor James Kelly," Arroyo said with a devious smile.
That's the irascible James M. Kelly from South Boston, the late longtime City Council president both revered and reviled for his unwavering principles. From behind that four-drawer, dark wooden desk, Kelly fought court-ordered busing and integration of public housing.
"Councilor James Kelly was a proud social conservative, so
his office and his desk were a place where that policy really took
root," Arroyo said. "Now I'm a proud progressive. To think, that desk
has seen both sides of that conversation."
During his 23 years on the council, Kelly also made a name
for himself for his obsessive attention to constituents' needs, often
responding personally to complaints about potholes and other urban
irritations. Arroyo hopes to do the same and suggested that he and
Kelly also both championed the causes of organized labor.
But the irony of them sharing a desk is rich. Arroyo
followed a trail blazed by his father to become only the second Latino
ever to be elected to the council. Kelly was famous for what could be
called a lack of ethnic sensitivity.
"All I would say is that he grew up in a different time
than me," Arroyo said, adding, "When they told me it was his desk, I
thought it was kind of cool."
