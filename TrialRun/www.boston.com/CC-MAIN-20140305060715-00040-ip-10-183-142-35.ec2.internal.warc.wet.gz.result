Posted about today's episode of Y&R and poof - it disappeared. What is Lauren thinking?? First of all, he's too young for her, and secondly, why would she want to fool around when she has Michael? Another thing, wish they would recast the role of their son. He looks like a weasel. Can't stand him. And poor Billy Boy. From the previews of tomorrow's episode, he tells Victoria he bought a restaurant rather than have her find out he's gambling again and won it in a poker game! Billy, Billy, Billy. Are you never going to learn? Victor's going to get ahold of that information and hold it over your head like a sledge hammer. Avery is another piece of work. She doesn't want to marry Dillon, but neither does she want to let him leave town and get on with his life. "stay and be my friend" - right. He'd better get out of town soon anyway, before he's hoodwinked into thinking he's papa to Chelsea's baby. See where Sharon is going to tell Adam that Chelsea's pregnant, and hopefully he'll find out he's the real father. Think that's all I saw today, but it was a pretty full half hour that I caught anyway. Have to make sure I watch tomorrows', sure it will be a Friday cliffhanger.

What a trying few days for you Winter. Good of you to show DS bravery in the face of overwhelming terror.

In response to genaro008's comment: This one is over It was over since 2nd quarter. This team isn't good enough and so is the coach. Barbosa should have been playing more minutes. Other guys didn't show up to play. You have chosen to ignore posts from prakash.

In response to Fierce34's comment: In response to prakash's comment: In response to Fierce34's comment: In response to prakash's comment: In response to Fierce34's comment: The defense forces the miss but the Hornets just grab the offensive rebound and put it back in the basket. Fierce, they are breaking us down in pick and roll. We just don't have anybody making shots. Making shots is the bigger problem. Nobody's making shots because the Hornets know the Celts will just shoot from the outside. NO INSIDE THREAT! Understand. But so many wide open shots are being missed. Make them and the lane will open up. You can't go outside first then inside. It's supposed to be pass the ball in the low post then kick it out if double teamed. A shooter will be open. There's no need to double team outside shooters, just challenge the shot. It doesn't matter how you get the open 3. The Celts got a lot of wide open 3s. They missed most of them. Plus the free throw issues. I conclude that the Celts just didn't have their focus today. Doc was conflicted and the Celts were just not ready.

In response to VeniceSox's comment: Fierce said it best when he stated that a "winning streak" solves all problems .... well this game is an obvious example of the same problems that make this team average. Rebounding problems, interior D issues and lack of a real scorer will keep the Cs in the middle of the pack... To get beat this badly at home is an embarrassment... horrible 3pt as well as foul shooting.. getting beat on the boards and no real fire from this team tonite... these are the games youd like to see rondo take over but it seems he goes the other direction.... not blaming Rondo for the loss but if he is the leader of this team then he needs to bring it every night
