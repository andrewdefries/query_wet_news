Deadly Delays SCITUATEResponse rate: 89.1% When Colleen Fyffe's home on the west side of town caught fire in January 2003, it took 20 minutes and three 911 calls for the fire department to arrive.

In Concord, a high price for suburban serenity
By Bill Dedman, Globe Correspondent | January 30, 2005
CONCORD -- For his family's 15,000-square-foot dream home, businessman Douglas R. Brown chose a wooded spot in the north end of Concord, not much different from when Henry David Thoreau hiked there in the 1850s."The remote location was an attractive issue for us," Brown recalled. "We never thought about the additional time it would take for the fire department to get there."Seven times now, emergencies small and large have schooled the Brown family in the price of serenity.

And they did choose to live at the northern edge of Concord, far from the nearest fire station. But a long wait for help can happen at any address in town.The Middlesex School, in northeast Concord, waited 8 minutes for a fire engine in 2000.

The two firefighters on each shift assigned to the ladder truck also serve as the ambulance crew. It is a recipe for trouble, as the Browns found out that Christmas Eve. The fire crew was busy with a stove fire; the ladder crew had to return to the station to get the ambulance and mak
