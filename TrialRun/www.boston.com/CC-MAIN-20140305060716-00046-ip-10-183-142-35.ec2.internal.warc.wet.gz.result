Khudobin has a better save % than Rask both...this season and life time ...I know he hasnt played that many games but still this season he is at .962 save % wich is the best in the NHL ...only 29 shots on Rask tonight wich means that with a %.962 save Khudo would have given only 1 goal tonight ...question : Khud Stanley have been right ??

In response to Chowdahkid-'s comment: In response to stevegm's comment: I agree nas. This type of sensationalism is becoming mainstream. I know it's standard news practice nowdays, but sports journalism seems to almost be getting worse. Wish they'd focus more on the drama of the game. The media hears what DiPietro said and they ran with it. Are they supposed to avoid it altogether and put it down as " ah he was only kidding" ?It was newsworthy considering what came out of his mouth originally. No they're supposed to act like professional journalists, not tabloid gossip mongers. I agree he didn't use the best choice of words(twice), but you fail to see the reporter showed even less maturity. If Di Pietro indeed said, "drive my car into a tree", a child should have been able to interpret what he meant. The media is always whining about the lack of colorful interviews, candor, and real emotion. This hackjob is a great example why that is so often the case. As for the "kidding" part of your statement, again, no. They're supposed to report news...not make it. They're assigned with the task of context. Failed miseably in both instances.&nbs

Lets brainstorm how we can shed this 12M, get well below the tax this year, and eliminate the logjam at PF.
I'll start. My question is, can we just give him to the Bobcats? Straight up for a TPE? If they need to include a player, I'll take anyone. Sessions would be alright. He's at 5M, an expiring deal, and he's a back-up PG. Heck, give them a future 2nd round pick to get the deal done. Shedding 7M allows us a lot more flexability this year in terms of signing vets and moving players. The ultimate goal is to not pay tax, so we avoid the repeater rules.
One Note: I've read that the CBA makes it so that you can only trade one player at a time for the guys we got from BKN. So unfortunately we cannot package Humphries with one of our many mediocre guards.

But aren't we under the luxury tax now? Getting under the cap is not going to happen this year, just not possible. What are we trying to do here again?

MVP, I agree.There are a number of ways this draft can play out, and the Pats have a number of needs.BPA does not exist, but when you have a ton of needs it can broaden the pool. Anyhow, this draft is so durned deep, and really lacks the blockbuster top-tier kids, so I cannot see any player worth moving up for really. I think if you are in the market for a CB maybe Jenkins?Crabtree possibly if you need a franchise WR?But is Orakpo that much better than English? Or Davis that much better than Smith?Incidentally, James Laraunitis has claimed that he can put on 15lbs in two weeks if necessary to play 3-4. That sounds really quick. But it also sounds kind of fun. Just go on an eating expedition. I would start at one of thoe steakhouses that sell the 72 oz challenge steaks, and if you finish it is free. LOL. But if he shows up to the combine weighing close to that figure it will be interesting.

It would be nice to have a taller CB to put on the taller receivers. I might be pretty thrilled to land Davis, if he can put together a convincing interview and satisfy some fundamental doubts. If he didn't have attitude/character question marks, they might be talking about him as the best CB prospect in years, and better than Jenkins.I just hope the Patriot ethos survives with the new generation after the icons gradually retire.Davis vs. Moss in practice would almost be must see.

Z, I meant to post this yesterday. Here's a recent photo of Maybin with his shirt off, and a discussion about it:http://draftcountdown.com/forum/showthread.php?t=30263I'd say he's about the 248 he claims to be, or within a few pounds of that.Still looks a little skinny, especially compared to Cushing.I'm still very intrugued, and have watched some sweet highlights on youtube under the name Penn St defense, and he's number 59 I believe.I've come around to agreeing with you that English is the better prospect, but if Maybin looks like he can cover like a madman, I'll be right back on the fence. And his arms are crazy long.What a jump off the snap this guy gets, though he could get swallowed up by tackles at the next level.Very young, very promising, slightly risky.

A lot of people thought the Pats needed to draft a WR. And a lot of people,for some reason, thought they would go after Dez Bryant. When it came out that the guy was about as bright as a bag of rocks, I knew there was no way Bill would target him.Apparently, stupidity isn't Dez's only issue. Turns out he's a grade A punk. He is in the news for refusing to do what all rookies do: take part in "hazing." He refused to carry a verteran's pads http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/07/25/dez-bryant-wont-carry-roy-williams-pads/He will accomplish two things with this little stunt: All the veterans will hate him and be rooting for him to fail. He has become an outcast immmediately. Secondly, they will screw him twice as hard. They are going to get him. The whole idea is to show the rookies a little humility. Like Williams said, they are going to take it up a notch. Now it's personal. He's disrespected all the vets with this move.And I can guarantee you if he doesn't learn his place, at some point in a preseason game, one of the vets will "miss" a block that gets Dez lit like a Christmas tree. Hopefully he isn't injured. But you can't say he didn't have it coming. He can play along now, or he can play along later. It's just a question of how hard he wants to make things for himself.And anybody that wants to defend Bryant for "sticking up for himself" has never played football and just doesn't have a clue as to how teams work. This guy is a joke. I am so happy the Pats didn't waste a pick on this arrogant antisocial loser.

Hey dafoe and ALL:Lmao, Check out THIS comment in the reader section of the article ya gave:"This makes me like Dez Bryant a million times more. Respected is demanded, not earned." ~Posted by (ROFLOL): IndyColtsfan45~Sorry people, This is far and away- Less about carrying some pretty mediocre NFL Vet's Shoulder Pads...Than it is about Teaching a fresh outta college NFL Rookie, a little respect & humility by having him do a meaningless simple task, HERE's WHY:Many of these Collegiate Football Superstars, WERE no doubt, the top apex of the food chain On their team, schools, peers, And EVERYthing and EVERYwhere else they knew... Suddenly they have become INFINITELY higher in popularity an recognition: Millions of dollars, 3 Cameras to 300 Cameras, Reporters, People and Circumstances bowing 100 fold to their every whim, And Yet: They haven't accomplished 1 d#mn thing yet in The Big Leagues, although they're being hailed as the next Messiah.THIS could, would and Should- Inflate their already Large Egos, Infinitely. Suddenly it's, I'M amazing, I'M a wonder, I AM the best... Huge Egos=No Humility. No Humility=I can do it alone, and need NOone. I can do it alone=NO TEAM. Look, IS this pointless, st#pid, and somewhat belittling? Yea. it is. But, It's the way of life in most every secular and/or exclusive organization and/or group. And it's MORE than instilling some humility as a curve to stave off some, "It's all about ME," Prima Dona Behavior... It's an initiation, a passage rite to show humility & grounding, secularization & unity, and finally acceptance & group mentorship.And please, This ain't someone getting beaten or drinking to death. This is simple and easy, An It HAS a reason and an aim. God, even IF the dude's a pr#ck, You really MIGHT NEED that vet to show you the ropes, learn something critical from, and ultimately get your back as a TEAMMATE...ya don't show 'em up and proverbially say, "I don't need you, Because I'm better than you." And man, Look- I HEAR Dez Bryant not wantin' to take cr#p from ANYone, After he had that Combine Interview, Where the sc#mbag NFL-Suit Interviewer, actually called his own Mom a h#, JUST to see HOW Dez would react. Here though? Jesus, It's a simple curve on self-pride, steering it towards the humility of WE and the counting on- US...THIS is different, THESE are the guy's Bryant needs to count on and be part of when they go to war together...

What is it with wide receivers? Being a disruptive influence on the team must be a prerequisite for that position. (My Interpretation) AHH, Yeah "I'm really happy Dallas drafted me but I just don't want to be part of the team so everybody leave me alone and watch me win games. They're not getting me the ball enough in training camp either."

Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not Laz. I've had the honor of being hazed or whatever you want to call it several times in my life. I don't know why it has any use in team building, but I am sure that it does. Maybe it's necessary to create a hierarchy, because without people on top and people on bottom we can't tap into the natural competitive drive to excel past others. Really, in the NFL everyone is the same, it is only the perceptions created by the players that make those on top. Every group needs leaders, and those leaders need to at least have the perception that they have earned their status. Several years ago I went to a Special Ops unit, and despite having some level of respect and power where I came from I was informed that I was in charge of the garbage cans. And furthermore I had to paint my name on the garbage cans and take them out every day along with a bunch of other pointless stuff. I could fight it, and probably not do a bunch of stupid things but in reality it wasn't going to earn me any respect. The feeling was "we did it, and if you don't than you are weak and we don't want you around." So I just did it, laughed about it, and a few months later I was "in." Now I can relate to Dez, later in my career I went to flight school and got to start all over again at the bottom. I was given the dubious honor of being in charge of stocking the fridge for snacks since I was "new." Now at this point in my career my left boot basically had more combat experience than all of the people "above me" combined, and I really wasn't feeling the superiority of my peers but that has to be proved, not told, so that is what I did and that's what Dex needs to do. What Dez, needs to do is play along and show on the field that Williams belongs on the bench and then he will get his respect. Now here in America we love our independent, non conformist types, but in other endeavors around the world like maybe sports, military, police, etc., cohesive teams are essential to success. So maybe he should keep his rebel, non conformist behaviours out of the football stadium.

In response to Joebreidey's comment: In response to georom4's comment: Paps has not tailed off at all as many predicted (myself included) but a great closer is not as valuable as a good starter and i would have rather seen the money spent that way I don't think people expected him to tail off 1.25 years into a 4+1 contract. The biggest issue is that most of the posters assessing FAs look at his first year and say 'we should've signed him'. Most contracts are good in the early portion. Paps did very well in 2011, so I would expect him to do well in 2012. But just like Teixeira, Gonzo, ARod, Ryan Howard, Carlos Lee, Helton, etc., the damage is almost always done in the latter half of the contract. I thought he was going to tail off immediately Notin - the indicators were there (sort of) - but the Phils prove my point that a great closer on a so so staff is not that important
