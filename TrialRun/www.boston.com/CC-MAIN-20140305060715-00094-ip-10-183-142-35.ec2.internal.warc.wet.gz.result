(Bill Griffith/Boston.com)
One of the most-anticipated rides I’ve taken was in Mini’s electric model, one of 500 prototypes being leased to select customers.
However, when it comes to driving an all-electric vehicle, Boston’s 1950s-era trolley cars were smoother.
Hit the gas and there was a lag before acceleration began. That’s disconcerting to anyone used to the always-perky Mini performance.
Hit the (regenerative) brakes and brace yourself. The computerized system is way off. The car stops so powerfully that you’re thrown against your seatbelt. Even just taking one’s foot off the accelerator winds up initiating a major braking event.
The suspicion here is that Mini tossed out some trial balloons and the revised versions will be fine.
And we’ll still be ready to line up for a test ride.

Why the acceleration lag? You didn't explain what causes it, and it shouldn't happen in an electric car. Unlike gasoline engines, electric motors have instant high torque.

Godwin's Law is invoked. Please don't stop writing for I am reading through the postering to actually learn alot about the juniors even if it is biased or worthy of challenge. It is far better reading than NHL dribblings of the defuncted season! You have chosen to ignore posts from Fletcher1.

In response to Klaas' comment:[QUOTE] In response to BsLegion's comment:[QUOTE] loss 3-2 for Canada Ugly game by Canada against the Finns. 2 5 on 3 PP goals for the Finns and a weak 3rd goal on Subban. As for the 2 other Bruins really didn't see anything special from Camara, Dougie looked ok on the 1st unit of PP other than that they, the whole team looked asleep . Let's call it jet lag. Canada very un-disciplined (Dougie 2 calls). Some so so calls but that's how they will call them in Europe. Also they better get used to the big ice service otherwise they'll have big problems in the tournament . Especially penalty killing , so so much space and Canada's PK was lost, awful. Wish I could check out the U.S. but some of us have to work. :) ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Nice update BsLegion. Canada's coach has no problems how Subban played in that game, unlike some of the meathead Canadian press. I didn't have privy to seeing that game, but the 3rd goal allowed by Subban was actually a deflection, not a weak goal. As per TSN.ca: The game-winning goal was the source of much of the criticism directed at the Belleville Bulls goalie, but Tugnutt absolved Subban of any blame for that one as well. "We have great video that I went through and, I don't think anyone knows, but the last goal was actually tipped," he said. "I was completely comfortable with Malcolm's game. I thought he made some key saves at key times to give us a chance and he'll just get better." "I saw it going up and my glove started going up," Subban said when asked about the third Finnish goal, "and then it started flipping down and I tried to get to it, but it was too late. It's whatever. I still got to do what I can. Obviously [the deflection] makes it a little more challenging." In Summary ... Subban allowed 2 goals when the Finns had a 5 on 3 PP ... the other go

Why does everyone think our secondary is awesome now? Shawn Springs is 34. How good a CB can he be? Leigh Bodden? Never heard of him. Wheatley and Wilhite are second year players. Who knows if they're ready. Butler is a rookie. He'll be at the bottom of the depth chart until mid-season. Hobbs left for contract reasons, not performance. None of the naysayers remember him pre-injury, in the 2006 playoffs, shutting down the Chargers' and Colts' wide receivers. He got injured returning kickoffs in the 2007 season - cause we really needed the field position that season. Why did we spend money on over-the-hillers Springs and Fred Taylor instead of locking up Hobbs? Unless Wheatley and Wilhite step up, this secondary ain't that good.

Then that is more a testament to how bad you think Springs and Bodden are, rather than how good Hobbs was. Hobbs was indeed a very good returner, but just an average back. I will not jump on the bandwagon of people who thought he was terrible. He was average as a back. Nothing worse, nothing better. The guy had heart and toughness, I'll give you that. I wish him the best of luck, but I am glad to see a change. I'll have faith in BB that the change is for the better.

A blind retarhd in a wheelchair can cover better than him. That's why they let him go. I'm pretty sure the urge to kick him in the buttoks on the way out the door was present.

In response to BabeParilli's comment: In response to russgriswold's comment: I don't care what he averages. I care how bad he is in AFC Title games or SBs, right wing nutty. You don't care what he averages once I expose your lie about what he averages! What a phony you are. Virtually every word out of your mouth is a lie. Brady has 2 INTs in 5 SBs, a 4.5-1 TD/INT ratio. You are soooooo lame dumbkoff. And he has a 5-2 AFCCG record, Montana is 4-3 in championship games. And Brady has a lower career %INT in the playoffs than Montana. Face it nutcase, your whole Brady is deficient in the playoffs spin hinges on a ONE GAME blowout by the the Ravens in 2009 when the whole team played like crap and Welker was hurt just before the playoffs. The D just melted right off the bat and Brady had to play catchup without ihis biggest offensive weapon of that year. Learn the game you imbecile. See, you guys go at it like Archie and Meathead! No offense to either of you........it is funny to watch sometimes though. You have chosen to ignore posts from BabeParilli.

In response to russgriswold's comment: So, in 2011 vs Denver when he did 6 TDs and 0 INTs and then turned around vs Baltimore and did 0 TDs and 2 INTs, that second game, with the poor outing, somehow washes away things because his "INT average" isn't awful? It's an average dumbkoff. You start taking things away to make a point and you're just cherry picking. Anybody can do that and bend something to look a certain way. Take away his 2004 playoffs and his pre 2007 numbers look the same as his post 2006 numbers. You have chosen to ignore posts from TFB12.
