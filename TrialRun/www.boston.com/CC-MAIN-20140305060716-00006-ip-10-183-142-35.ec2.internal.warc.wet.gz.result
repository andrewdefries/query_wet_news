In response to slomag's comment: In response to Hansoribrother's comment: [QUOTE] In response to A_Concerned_Citizen's comment: [QUOTE] In response to Hansoribrother's comment: [QUOTE] Leftwingers have such faith in Putin and Assad to live up to their agreement. How touching. I thought it was the neo-cons that were cheering for Putin. Obama started the mess by trying to get us involved in something that had no support. He was leading the charge and when he turned around there was no one there. When I see Obama supporting terrorists in Palestine, Egypt, Libya and now Syria, I see the same thing happening that led to Iran and Afghanistan turning into rougue states. I fail to see how that is good for us. Libya and Egypt are already on their way to becoming home to terrorists that want to attack us. Congratulations lefties!! To summarize: Obama and the US, according to the wingnuts, had no justification to launch a strike at Syria, despite the fact that Syria broke a long-standing worldwide UN ban on chemical weapons. Apparently Saddam breaking a UN resolution and gassing his own people a quarter of a century prior is enough justification to invade his country. lose 4000 American troops in the process and still not find those wmd's. Fine. Whatever... Putin in Russia and Assad in Syria admit that Syria has stockpiles of wmd (something Saddam constantly denied and was proven he wasn't lying) and the ability to manufacture more. They agree to an ultimatum which demands the unilateral disarming of these weapons overseen by international inspectors under a UN resolution. They also agree to go on record, signing the UN chemical weapons ban pledging not to use or manufacture these weapons in the future.... and did all this all because Kerry made a condescending, sarcastic remark. The US gets wmd out of the hands of a psychopath without firing a shot and the the wingnuts are apoplectic because we didn't lose 4000 more Americans in a futile war to do it. So, despite the fact that everything about the negotiation is in the US's favor, the whackjob wingnuts go beserk and plant their lips squarely on Putin's derier, proclaiming him a 'winner' for giving the US everything we wanted....all because they share a common hatred from Obama. The wingnuts are one seriously unhinged bunch of dipsticks. [/QUOTE] As a presidential candidate, Sen. Barack Obama (D.-Ill.) emphatically stated that the Constitution does not give the president the authority to unilaterally authorize a military attack unless it is needed to stop an actual or imminent attack on the United States. Obama made the assertion in a Dec. 20, 2007 interview with the Boston Globe when reporter Charlie Savage asked him under what circumstances the president would have the constitutional authority to bomb Iran without first seeking authorization from Congress. “The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation,” Obama responded.“As Commander-in-Chief, the President does have a duty to protect and defend the United States,” Obama continued. “In instances of self-defense, the President would be within his constitutional authority to act before advising Congress or seeking its consent. History has shown us time and again, however, that military action is most successful when it is authorized and supported by the Legislative branch.” ------------------------ There is no such threat to the USA as a result of chemical weapons being used in Syria. It is obvious by Obama's actions that he does not have support of Congress to conduct a military strike on Syria. And I see the leftwingers here continue to have faith in Putin and Assad that they are going to go through all of the bureaucratic steps to verify that the weapons have been identified and destroyed in the MIDDLE OF A CIVIL WAR?!?!? Didn't Assad say he didn't have any? Oh he was lying?Shocker! But now the dull witted lefties believe him when he agrees to destroy all of his chemical weapons. This is all face-saving politics by the President at the expense of our security for we will certainly be threatened again to test the weaknes and incompetence displayed by Obama. That is the real threat here, not Syria's chemical weapons. Dull witted libruls - fighting for the islamic jihadists [/QUOTE] UN weapon inspectors will verify

In response to dezaruchi's comment: I don't agree that they played horribly for that long. They started well and had a lull in the middle frame. Then they got down 3-1 to some bad bounces so they had to take way more risks to try to climb back in it. That led to another odd man rush and a 4-1 Leaf lead. I felt the Leafs lead was mostly a result of puck luck. Wins are wins. Doing it with 5 D that included 2 rookies just makes it more special. I still can't believe it.

Here is the prepared text of Governor Deval Patrick’s State of the Commonwealth speech, which he is delivering tonight in the House chamber at the State House.
Lieutenant Governor, fellow Constitutional Officers and members of the Governor’s Council, Madame President and Members of the Senate, Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Judiciary, Members of the Congressional Delegation,
Municipal and other Elected Officials, Members of the Cabinet and Administration, Reverend Clergy, and, most especially, Fellow Citizens of Massachusetts.
Good evening and Happy New Year. Please join me in welcoming our extraordinary First Lady, Diane Patrick. I thank you for your unsung service and for putting up with me. Before I begin, let us pause quietly to reflect on the necessary sacrifice of our men and women in uniform here and abroad, and the unnecessary sacrifice of those poor first graders and their teachers in Newtown, Connecticut, and all those lost to gun violence in our neighborhoods here at home.
I spent some time yesterday at the Orchard Gardens School in Roxbury. I’ve talked about this school before. Whenever I visit Orchard Gardens or any of the many other extraordinary schools in the Commonwealth, I wonder whether people in public service should make such visits a daily requirement. The energy, the optimism, the hopefulness provide both fuel and focus for our work. Yesterday, I listened to first, third and eighth-graders read essays on “What I want to be when I grow up.” They want to be engineers and firefighters, to work in clean tech and go to law school. Adriana, an unimaginably poised second grader, told me her dream was to be a teacher. Every one of them is thinking about college.
I was the first person in my family to go to college. I grew up with grandparents who were educated only as far as the third grade and a mother who had dropped out of high school. My big break came through a scholarship to Milton Academy when I was 14. And while (thankfully) no one ever told me college was not for me, Milton was the first environment I was ever in where college was a normal expectation.
I applied to five colleges back then. When the letter arrived saying I was admitted to the one I really wanted, I called home with the news and my
