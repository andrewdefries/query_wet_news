Julian Edelman - WR - Patriots
Free agent WR Julian Edelman is visiting the Giants.
It's the first we've heard of Edelman since the start of free agency. The local media has been expecting Edelman to re-sign with the Patriots, but ESPN Boston believes the broken foot that landed him on injured reserve last December has been stalling his market. Edelman may be steamed the Pats signed Danny Amendola to replace Wes Welker instead of giving him a chance in the slot, but he'd have more depth-chart climbing to do in New York than New England.

First piece of good news. I thought he will shop himself around to the highest bidder. That is a surprise quick move by the Pats.

Nice! I made a thread about this a week or two ago hoping we get him and I think this changes the draft completely. He apparently has a 2nd round grade, from what I hear, so it's pretty much like a free second round pick. First round, Pats can draft a DE. Assuming Chandler Jones is healthy and improves (hopefully makes a JPP like jump), then Jones, Nink, 1st round pick, and Francis is a decent DE group. Maybe they can find a veteran edge rusher, but this isn't a terrible group. Then 2nd round, they can just take the best player available. Sorry, I don't trust BB spending high picks with dbs anymore. Get them via FA or later in the draft.

In Response to Re: NEWS FLASH - In case you haven't noticed Ellsbury is having one of the greatest years ever for a lead off batter!:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: NEWS FLASH - In case you haven't noticed Ellsbury is having one of the greatest years ever for a lead off batter! : If he wins the mvp vote, I think he's a superstar.How many guys win multiple MVP titles? Very few. He is putting up huge numbers this year and has already earned the superstar title after this year in my opinion. He has also led the league in SB before. And hit over .300 before. He was an emerging star. His numbers overall have been comparable to Crawford's and now he has topped Crawford's best year. If Crawford got $140 mil, I think he was considered a superstar. In Crawford's best year, in 2010, he had 62 XBH, far fewer than Ellbury. Ellsbury is making Crawford's last year look mediocre. It's semantics. He could tank next year and lose the moniker but this year, IMO, he is a superstar player.Posted by Boomerangsdotcom[/QUOTE]I don't put as much credence in awards as you do, Boom.Many are by-product of popularity contests.And too many members of press have bias which alters voting.Nor do I use the term superstar lightly. In fact, IMO, only Pujois is a legit superstar. I'm going by production, not salary, as many players are over-paid.Aroid will never fit the criteria because he's an admitted user. No telling how much of his production was needle-induced. AGONE has SS status, but needs to have a post-season resume to match.Verlander needs multiple seasons like 2011 to qualify. Same with Jake.Halladay is upper echelon. In my book, huge difference between star quality and elite level of super-stardom.

In Response to NEWS FLASH - In case you haven't noticed Ellsbury is having one of the greatest years ever for a lead off batter!:[QUOTE]Rickey Henderson's best year ever for RBI = 74. Ellsbury now has 98 with quite a few games left. Has any leadoff batter ever had more than 100 RBI? Rickey Henderson never had more than 64 XBH in a year. Ellsbury now has 78 folks, with games left to play. He is a PLUS 15.6 UZR/150 and is now a 8.7 WAR, with a valuation of $39.2 MIL for his year SO FAR. He should edge out Bautista for the MVP vote if it were held today. He's been that good ladies and gentlemen. Ellsbury is having one of the greatest year's ever for a leadoff batter.Posted by Boomerangsdotcom[/QUOTE]"for a leadoff hitter"? who cares? that is meaningless. if he was batting 9th, you could say he is having the one of the greatest years ever for a #9 hitter.

As the role of women increases in Judaism, questions swirl about a gender imbalance

American Judaism has a boy problem.After several thousand years in which women were relegated to the sidelines of worship and community leadership, scholars and denominational leaders now say that women are significantly outnumbering men in numerous key segments of non-Orthodox Jewish community life.At the Reform movement's seminary, 60 percent of the rabbinical students and 84 percent of those studying to become cantors are female. Girls are outnumbering boys by as much as 2 to 1 among adolescents in youth group programs and summer camps, while women outnumber men at worship and in a variety of congregational leadership roles, according to the Union for Reform Judaism.The evidence is everywhere. At Temple Sinai in Sharon, nine of the 11 members of this year's confirmation class were girls. At Temple Beth David in Canton, last Saturday's Bible study drew 11 women and no men. At Temple Isaiah in Lexington, the executive board for the last year had eight women and one man. And at the Prozdor, an intensive supplementary high school program at Hebrew College in Newton, 59 percent of the students are female."After bar mitzvah, the boys just drop out," said Sylvia Barack Fishman, a professor of contemporary Jewish life at Brandeis University and the coauthor of a study on "Gender Imbalance in American Jewish Life," which was publicly released last week."American Jewish boys and men have fewer connections to Jews and Judaism in almost every venue and in every age, from school-age children through the adult years," the study declares. "Contemporary liberal American Judaism, although supposedly egalitarian, is visibly and substantially feminized."As with so much about gender, every
