5 Corners KitchenThis is his first restaurant, but Marblehead local Barry Edelman knows what he’s doing. He’s worked at both Lumiere and Aquitaine, and that French training comes through in his smoked garlic sausage with lentils and his steak frites, some of the best around. But this is a New World bistro, which means more inventive dishes, such as chili-rubbed pork chop with preserved lemon and romesco sauce, too. It’s worth a drive north, and if you live nearby, lucky you. 2 School Street, Marblehead, 781-631-5550The AbbeyFans of Brookline’s Washington Square Tavern will love this comfortable and comfortably priced nearby hangout, opened by two alums. Chef Josh Sherman serves his craveable bison Bolognese and other New American dishes; those and a generous selection of single malts will keep you cozy through the winter. 1657 Beacon Street, Brookline, 617-730-8040, http://abbeyrestaurant.comAka BistroHalf sashimi bar, half French bistro means double the pleasure for western suburban diners. Lincoln got lucky when manager Christian Touche and chef Christopher Chung joined forces. Their combined talents, plus easy parking, create an easy-on-the-palate, easy-to-return-to restaurant. The menu ranges from classic mussels with frites and perfect lamb loin chops with a potato galette to sustainably raised kindai tuna belly slices with miso mignonette. 145 Lincoln Road, Lincoln, 781-259-9920, http://akabistrolincoln.comAlma NoveHollywood comes to Hingham as Paul Wahlberg (the chef brother of actors Mark and Donnie) opens this scene-y eatery on the water. You’ll find crowds, cocktails, and satisfying fare influenced by Italy – flaky cod cakes and rich meatballs, tagliatelle with short ribs, and halibut kissed by North African flavors. 22 Shipyard Drive, Hingham, 781-749-3353, http://almanovehingham.comAriana RestaurantFrom your first taste of warm nan to the last crumb of sweet, nutty bucklawa, you’ll be thrilled with this beautiful Afghan cooking. A former Helmand chef is in the kitchen making this saucy, rice-based cuisine, with similarities to both Indian and Middle Eastern foods. 129 Brighton Avenue, Allston, 617-208-8072, http://arianarestaurantboston.comAzamaPerch on a stool in the window of this tiny spot and sip delicious lemony red-lentil soup, then split a juicy lamb kebab dish with a friend. The owner is Egyptian, the food is halal, and the cooking is exceptional. 54 Harvard Avenue, Allston, 617-779-0003, http://azamagrill.comBergamotThis restaurant has been firing on all cylinders since the week it opened. Chef Keith Pooler brings both solid technique and exciting flavor combinations to his food: plantain gnocchi, pork tenderloin with sweet and sour eggplant and shishito peppers. It’s lovely and delicious. Combine that with great wine and warm hospitality, and you have a winner. 118 Beacon Street, Somerville, 617-576-7700, http://bergamotrestaurant.comBlack Duck Market & DeliFollowing a heated, only-in-the-suburbs protest of a CVS moving to a space that had been occupied by Newburyport’s local White Hen franchise, owner Scott Munroe gave the bird a second coming with a market and deli in the Tannery. Made-to-order sandwiches (the duck-ball grinder is a favorite), homemade organic soups, and fresh-baked cookies complement all the basics a beach town general store needs: coffee, peanut butter, bug spray. Tannery Historic Marketplace, 50 Water Street, Newburyport, 978-462-0323
Boston Local Food FestivalOn a glorious Saturday in October, Boston’s first Local Food Festival drew 30,000 attendees to the waterfront at Fort Point for $5 tastings, demos on subjects from butchering to baking, and face time with farmers, chefs, and food entrepreneurs. The Seafood Throwdown was a net win for everybody. http://bostonlocalfoodfestival.comChopChopThis cooking magazine for families is an inspiration. The beautiful layout, great recipes, games, puzzles, and tips are intended to get children ages 5 to 12 (and their parents) excited about cooking and eating real food. The magazine has the endorsement of the American Academy of Pediatrics. http://chopchopmag.comCitizen Public House & Oyster BarThe team behind the South End’s Franklin Cafe has set up shop in the Fenway, with chef Brian Reyelt serving nouveau takes on tavern standbys. The Citizen is dark, cozy, and capable of serving you and nine friends a whole roast suckling pig. In addition to craft cocktails and 80 kinds of whiskey, it offers cult digestif Fernet-Branca on tap. What more could you want? 1310 Boylston Street, Boston, 617-450-9000, http://citizenpub.comCutty’sWhen a Culinary Institute of America grad and former Cook’s Illustrated ed

Cory Booker , soon to be Democrat Senator from New Jersey is actually an interesting politician, does seem to bring different perspectives , doesnt always toe the liberal line...friend of Chris Christie, defender of Mitt Romney's business enterprises...
However, it was funny how he addressed supposed rumors that he is gay, so so politically correctly.
"And people who think I’m gay, some part of me thinks it’s wonderful. Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I’m gay, and I say, ‘So what does it matter if I am? So be it. I hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I’m straight.’ ”--Cory Booker
Well, it matters a lot to guilty white liberals, who would die to vote for an openly gay black candidate to show themselves how wonderfully tolerant they are.........so if Booker wants to sew up the Democratic Party nomination in 2020 or so, there is just one thing left to do.
The coup de grace will be when Cory Booker gets an operation and becomes a transgendered gay woman!
Gay, black and a woman...a "threefer" !!!! Pandering guilty white liberals wouldn't be able to resist voting for "three minorities in one" Cory, er, "Chelsea" Booker !!

In Response to Re: Welcome to the Bruins Dougie Hamilton:[QUOTE]I love how people who truly have never seen the kid for one second before tonight's game are all on his jock, and yet I make a statement about drafting in general and I'm the bad guy. You love the pick because of what THEY say. I hate the pick because of history. Before you starting clammering for a spot on this kid's lap and counting your future Cup rings, take a look back over the past 10 years at defensemen drafted in the Top 10. Then come back here, RIGHT HERE, and apologize for being so stupid that you chose to jump on me without having the slightest bit of knowledge on the subject. (Most defesemen drafted in the Top 10 over the past 10 years are either busts or on different teams.) I'll wait right here. Go get your shinebox.Posted by Not-A-Shot[/QUOTE]First thought when he got picked was Tyler Myers from Sabres. Very comparable although he wa picked 12th by Sabres. Proof enough to prove your theory wrong.I like this pick only and it's not that I've really seen him play but got a pretty good scouting report from a member here (Chowdah) that has seen him play a lot and had nothing but good things to say about him.

B*tch. Whine. B*tch. Whine. Julien's crap. Flip Flop Tuna Thomas. The Bs will win nothing with Jacobs. Kaberle will lose the cup for the Bs. Kelly adds nothing. Hamilton will be a bust or will never play for the Bs. Blah, Blah, Blah. Sound familiar? And where did it get you? Some of you guys really need to change the record. Yeah, some of the first round D picks have been pretty ropey but where/how exactly did the Bs acquire Orr and Bourque? Exactly.Now listen. Acquiring Hamilton was a no brainer and the best choice the Bs could have made as the #9 pick.Next! You have chosen to ignore posts from red75.

Workman is headed to the pen after this deal becomes offical. This helps the BP greatly. Still would like one more righty.
