IRobot wins injunction against competitor

A federal judge in Boston has issued an injunction against a Chicago-area robot maker accused of stealing trade secrets from iRobot Corp. of Burlington.
In August, iRobot sued Robotic FX Inc. of Alsip, Ill., a company founded by former iRobot engineer Jameel Ahed. IRobot claimed that Ahed had used iRobot trade secrets in the building of a robot called the Negotiator, which beat out iRobot�s PackBot for a $280 million military contract.
After the suit was filed, detectives hired by iRobot witnessed Ahed trying to discard iRobot-related materials. Ahed also acknowledged shredding data CDs and erasing hard drives. Ahed said that he was not destroying evidence, but US District Judge Nancy Gertner said that his behavior ��gives rise to a strong inference of consciousness of guilt�� and ��profoundly undermines Ahed�s credibility as a witness.��
During closed court hearings, iRobot discussed three areas in which it claimed the company�s trade secrets had been stolen by Robotic FX. Gertner refused to issue an injunction covering two of the areas, saying iRobot had revealed some of the information in a patent filing, thus undermining its status as a trade secret. But Gertner said there was good evidence that Robotic FX may have misappropriated iRobot technology used to make the rubber tracks that propel its robots. ��While Ahed claims that he developed the track independently, this court will not credit his testimony,�� Gertner wrote. Because the tracks are vital to the operation of the Negotiator robots, the injunction is a major barrier to continued manufacturing operations at Robotic FX � at least until a trial is held in April. Officials at Robotic FX did not return calls seeking comment. (By Hiawatha Bray, Globe staff)

In response to PhatRex's comment:[QUOTE] In response to Neal Page's comment:[QUOTE] In response to Homecheese's comment:[QUOTE] Cromartie says the Jets will make the playoffs http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/8607511/antonio-cromartie-rex-ryan-new-york-jets-make-playoffs [/QUOTE]LOL! Cannot be made up. Absolutely cannot be. [/QUOTE]Imagine what would happen to you if Cromarie is right? After all, I was convined that you had finally taken your own life during the fourth quarter of the Jets/Patriots game after the Jets slammed the ball from McCourty in the fourth quarter and the Patriots still had the lead. How pathetic was that of you running away for a week....or was it "out closing a big $50,000 deal" on latex futures? Then, you claimed that by some shocking coincidence you were "banned" at the precise moment that it looked as though the Patriots would lose the game. Rusty at his most pathetic. Yep, if the Jets can overcome the loss of their best defensive player (the best CB in the NFL) and their best offensive player and make the playoffs, I'm positive that you will truely finish yourself off. [/QUOTE]Dont hold your breath. Not gonna happen Phatty.

It's exiting to see all the attention on the propsects ... I know it's the right week at Fenway, but it's a refreshing thing to see all the same.
I know propsects are still prospects, but after any number of years we had to stick up for our prospects as sort of "oh yeah, well I like ours better" and stick out our chests in Red Sox bravado ... all the while having a real nagging sense that the farm wasn't producing good reason for hope.
I am recalling a loooonnng history of this reality, remembering the days when the Orioles had a system that was so good their AAA squad in Rochester was probably good enough to beat several MLB teams (those years under Earl Weaver, give or take ...), and the Yanqui system that produced the "Core Four" and more - yup, they signed big name FAs, but they seemed to have a decent pipeline as well. Of course, the Rays have had a farm system full of arms ...
Anyway, while some manage to wage a war of negativity against the present FO - old habits die hard - we can be glad for the careful way they have protected and restocked the farm with truly admirable and exciting prospects.
After the debacle that was last year, I find this, the immediate and close to near future as exciting.

The Red Sox have always had a problem producing and keeping young pitchers. Many of our greats have come from other organizations, Pedro, Schilling, Tiant , ( even Beckett , who was great it 2007). I used to follow the Bruins ( back when hockey was worth it), and they had a similar problem with goalies. The few good ones they had always came from elsewhere, Cheevers, Gilbert, Peeters, Lemelin, Moog. When they did actuallt draft a talented goalie they would go on and have success elsewhere, Bernie Parent, Danny Bouchard , Bill Ranford. The Red Sox need to draft , develope and keep some quality pitching. John Lester could easily have been given up on, but I give them credit for having faith that he will bounce back. Another lefthander that became a steady successful pitcher , John Tudor , was dealt away and became the ace for St. Louis Cardinals. Oakland has a terrific track record for producing good young pitching. This team emphasizes pitching and they have a keen eye for talent in that area. Instead of throwing millions at has-been pitchers like Smoltz, Wells , Dumpster and similar useless pitchers, they would be better off hiring some decent scouts and coaches to imitate what Oakland does. Unlike Oakland, the Red Sox have the money to keep these guys once they mature into MLB top tier pitchers. I would prefer this startegy to picking damaged goods off the scrap heap, which seems to be the logic used with our brilliant front office spin doctors.
