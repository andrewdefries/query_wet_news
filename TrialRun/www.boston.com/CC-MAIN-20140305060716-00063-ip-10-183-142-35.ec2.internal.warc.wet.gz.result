Use a restroom outside Fenway before entering. Have an Italian sausage with onions on the street before and/or after the game. Avoid sitting along the right grandfield stands as they do not face home plate and you will leave the park with a stiff neck. Enjoy the game. It will be an everlasting memory. Sox4ever
