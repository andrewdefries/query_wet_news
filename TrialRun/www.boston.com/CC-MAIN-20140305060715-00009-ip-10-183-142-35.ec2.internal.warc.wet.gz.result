Food doesn’t match billing at Stephi’s on Tremont
The lobster shepherd’s pie (above) and the hot smoked trout are commendable entrees at Stephi’s on Tremont in the South End.

This is a tale of two restaurants. One, Stephanie’s on Newbury, a see-and-be-seen spot popular with tourists and shopping gal pals. The other, Garden of Eden, a neighborhood cafe for South End residents in search of brunch, sandwiches, and socializing. They had a few things in common - stellar patios, average food. But they felt very different, by virtue of their locations. Stephanie’s felt like shiny Newbury Street, Garden of Eden like the more alternative South End.Then Garden of Eden closed, the victim of a dwindling customer base (and the pesky little matter of unpaid meal taxes). And who should take over the space but Stephanie Sokolove, owner of the namesake Newbury spot, and now also Stephi’s on Tremont, the little sister restaurant with the cutesy nickname.There were doubters. The South End doesn’t have the kind of tourists and shoppers that make up the crowd at Stephanie’s, they said. Or, the South End just isn’t the right place for a Stephanie’s clone.But Stephi’s isn’t a clone. Just like real siblings, the two places have different personalities. To the doubters’ surprise, Stephi’s on Tremont looks like a pretty big hit. For one thing, it’s more of a neighborhood hangout than one might have expected, with a lively bar scene. For another, that neighborhood has changed since Garden of Eden’s heyday. “More alternative’’ becomes less alternative each year. And so the people at Stephi’s are an interesting mix: preppies, families, business people, tattoo obsessives, rich kids, older couples, women in going-out outfits, neighborhood types, and one night a guy who looks like a younger Hulk Hogan.Stephi’s catches plenty of its barflies with sugar: The cocktail menu is replete with flavored vodkas. The wine list is fairly mass-market and reasonably priced. When a customer tells a server she wants sangria but not if it’s sweet, he recommends the pink version over the red. The first sip is a high-fructose pow right in the kisser. Offer up a prayer for the teeth of the person who favors the red.The food is more palatable. It’s the equivalent of Juicy sweats, a tad more dressed up than your average comfort fare. Meatloaf gets stuffed with cheddar cheese, shepherd’s pie spiffed up with lobster, and macaroni and cheese fancified with prosciutto and truffle oil. These dishes aren’t fooling anyone: They’re still sweatpants.There’s a certain amount of overlap with the food at Stephanie’s on Newbury; executive chef Corey Comeau comes from that kitchen. On the menu, adjectives abound. In a section marked “comfort food classics,’’ the meatloaf is billed as “our famous meatloaf.’’ In the whole entire world, how many restaurant dishes actually qualify as famous? And how many of these are described as being famous on the menu? Fame means never having to say you’re famous. But if the claim must be made, at least be better than OK. Stephi’s meatloaf is OK. The texture is good. The cheddar doesn’t add much flavor. The mushroom gravy tastes salty and . . . brown. The mashed potatoes are bland and airy.
The macaroni and cheese is “legendary.’’ I would describe it as “creamy,’’ which doesn’t have the same ring.
