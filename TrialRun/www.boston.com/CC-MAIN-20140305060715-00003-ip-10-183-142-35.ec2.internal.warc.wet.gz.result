Music A musical mensch-in-residence, with 'keys in hand'
In his Medford home, Yehudi Wyner, 80, recalls his career’s expanse, studying, singing, playing, composing, and the influence on him of his father’s Yiddish art songs.

If you go to a classical concert in Boston - one with music that really matters, whether old or new - there’s a good chance you’ll find the composer Yehudi Wyner perched near the back of the hall, surveying the scene with warm eyes and a knowing presence. Bump into him at intermission and he might dispense a wry joke or a casual but penetrating remark about what you’ve just heard. He’s not there simply for a pleasant night out but because, in short, he is one of the most actively engaged composers you will meet.Wyner, who is also a fine pianist and conductor, an adored teacher, and the city’s all-around musical mensch-in-residence, turned 80 this month and there have been generous tribute concerts here and in New York. And a new CD out on the Bridge label finally gives listeners a chance to encounter or meet again his Pulitzer Prize-winning Piano Concerto “Chiavi in Mano,’’ in a superb performance by Robert Levin and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, recorded in concert under the baton of Robert Spano in February 2005.As this disc alone makes clear, Wyner is a rare breed of composer. He has lived through a century of musical polemics but never cast his lot with any one of the dom inant stylistic schools of his day. He has spent decades teaching at universities (Yale, SUNY Purchase, and until his retirement a few years ago, Brandeis) but he does not write what could be called academic music.He is rather a composer with a fiercely independent spirit, a modernist who believes that serious music can and should still bring sensual pleasure. His works are vital and capacious, often finding fresh ways of wedding extremely visceral expression with a refined sense of craft. Levin, speaking by phone recently from Florida, where he is again performing Wyner’s Piano Concerto, described his music this way: “It delights, it exalts, it mourns, it broods, it rejoices, it engages in behavior which is sophisticated and elegant, and at times in something which is raucous and obstreperous. It’s just a wonderful combination.’’To know the music is also to know the man. The other day, Wyner took a break between rehearsals for an upcoming recording and met for a conversation in his studio. The space was once a freestanding garage just behind his Medford home but Wyner has converted it into a kind of Mahlerian composer’s hut, crowded with a piano, scores, recordings, and memories.He is a natural raconteur who talks like he writes music, with a crisp precision of language - he might dismiss a piece as “Victorian fustian’’ or simply as “repellent’’ - but also with colloquialisms tossed in to season the mix, sometimes from the Yiddish he learned as a boy. He began a conversation that spanned several hours by speaking about his father, the composer Lazar Weiner, and continued with reflections on his own journey in music.
Roots in the Kiev opera To be sure, Wyner’s story rightly begins on the day that his father, the son of a shoemaker in Ukraine, was plucked from his town by a passing musician and given the opportunity to sing in a choir at the great Brodsky Synagogue of Kiev. Lazar went on to become a boy soprano in the Kiev opera and even sang alongside the legendary Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin. He immigrated to New York and ultimately became the leading composer of Yiddish art songs. Wyner (whose last name was changed by his father when he was a boy) is deeply admiring of his father’s legacy and has labored to help preserve it.“Essentially what he did was to codify in a body of work a whole culture, and to embody that culture in its most idealistic and most passionate medium,’’ Wyner said. “My feeling is that it is a monument to a certain aspect of idealistic Judaism, and to Yiddish. I also feel now that time passes and I’ve lived with those songs over the years, they only get better, they don’t tarnish. My feeling is that as long as there is classical music, and any aspiration for singing art songs like those of Schubert, Brahms, and Wolf, there will be a place for this music.’’Wyner grew up in New York, and his musical gifts were spotted early and encouraged at Juilliard. His piano technique was good enough for him to consider a solo career but he could not reconcile himself to playing the same repertoire again and again, nor did he think he had the prodigious memory required to succeed as a concert virtuoso. Composing beckoned, and two of the most magnetic teachers at the time were both Ã©migrÃ©s from Hitler’s Europe: Arnold Schoenberg, who taught at two schools in Southern California, and Paul Hindemith, who taught at Yale. Wyner was more drawn to Hindemith’s music at that time, so off he went to New Haven, only to learn upon arrival that Hindemith did not have real contact with undergraduates. Years later, when Wyner embarked on graduate study at Yale, he finally got the old man’s attention.“It was a struggle and not very pleasant,’’ Wyner said bluntly. By that time, his romance with Hindemith’s music had faded and he recalled having frequent arguments with his teacher over the way a piece of music should be heard. As part of his training, however, Wyner also sang in a chorus directed by Hindemith, and that experience, he said, was revelatory. The chorus began with music from the 12th century and worked incrementally up through Anton Bruckner. “For Hindemith, every composer had an individual stamp, was so characteristically himself, and yet also a representative of a whole culture. It was wonderful.’’
After completing his studies Wyner won a fellowship to spend three idyllic years at the American Academy in Rome, living in a communal setting with poets and writers of all stripes . Elliott Carter was also there, and Wyner had the opportunity to immerse himself in Carter’s music and in some essential scores by revolutionary

Verizon drops new supplier surcharge after customer complaints

Verizon Communications cancelled a days-old supplier surcharge on high-speed Internet service after customers complained that the company was taking advantage of them by replacing an expiring government tax with a fee of its own.
"We have listened to our customers and are eliminating this charge in response to their concerns," said Bob Ingalls, chief marketing officer of Verizon Telecom.
Verizon stopped collecting a federal tax called the Universal Service Fund on DSL customer bills on Aug. 14 and replaced it last Saturday with its own fee that comes out to be just slightly less. The new fee, called a supplier surcharge, was to go to Verizon.
Some of Verizon's 6 million DSL customers had reacted with dismay to the new supplier surcharge, which is equal to 8 to 9 percent of their monthly bill.

The President's claim that his new ideas for federal programs wont raise the deficit, has the same credibility as his promise to halve the deficit in his first term... The liberal media will no doubt ignore the substance of Marco Rubio's speech and obsess over his getting a drink of water...

The Republicans just launched a new attack on Social Security.Marco Rubio's response to the President's State of the Union absolutely buried the headline: Republicans want to make devastating cuts to Social Security benefits. Maybe you missed it because Rubio awkwardly took a sip of water...sorry but he did... and then tried to sell those cuts to the American people as a plan to reduce the deficit and "save" Social Security.The Republican plan to "save" Social Security? It's just another scheme to push down working families and prop up subsidies for big corporations.

Nash is in a terrible situation. We saw what he could do when he was playing his game at the last olympics. Torts wants nash to be a shot blocking trapper. nash is an extremely talented player. I blame that system more then the player. ie. Gabby, richards, nash etc etc etc. torts kills offensively gifted players by making them soccer players. You have chosen to ignore posts from Not-A-Shot.

The "linemates" arugment only really goes so far, doesn't it? At what point does someone say yeah, but, Rick, I mean...come on.... Brad Richards is exactly the kind of player you would expect Nash to thrive with. He distributes the puck very well - good proxy for JT Superstar, who is the best fit for Nash I've ever seen. They had his with Gaborik on the other side. That line worked out so badly that Gaborik was shipped out, Richards demoted to the fourth line...and St. Rick? Derick Brassard is able to score almost a point/game in that system, with those teammates, in the playoffs. Nash is 6th on the team in playoff scoring. Again, I agree with a lot of the things people are saying in Nash's defense, but it isn't a "not-guilty" defense. It's a "guilty under extenuating circumstances."

R. Turair to decide between Boston and Miami Wednesday. ProBasketballTalk KG has show me that he should be resigned by Boston, he may be one of the better free agents that we can get. Steamer has look good lately, he should be a Boston keeper also. WE are in desperate need of a couple of big tough guys, hurry Danny.

Today they played Bradley in LF some. For the first time. I want to send Bradley to AAA ball for 11 games but then he is slotted as our leadoff guy soon after being called up. Possibly immediately upon call up. Why? This is why. Against RH pitching, this is probably a much better lineup: 1) Bradley 2) Pedroia 3) Ellsbury 4) Napoli 5) Middlebrooks 6) Nava 7) Sweeney 8) Salty 9) Iglesias / Drew I think Farrel should give Victorino a shot for 11 games in RF, and I fully expect him to hit LH pitching well but he and Gomes should maybe sit against RH pitching, especially if either do not produce early on. They are always available to pinch hit as needed later in the game but with the above lineup they could DH Napoli and play Nava at 1st ( or vice versa ) with the outfield still being decent defensively with Sweeney, Bradley and Ellsbury. Perhaps most importantly, I think we need to slot Ellsbury #3 on this team, this year. We need some Right / Left balance and he is by far the most likely offensive stud we have on this team this year IMO. We need to be able to produce runs when against RH pitching, especially if Ortiz is not expected to contribute much. We could then trade Victorino / Sweeney and it looks like even Aceves might have some value right now as well.

Now that the big storm is over, I am looking at why this was such a poor forecast. The basic reason was a bit more cold air than expected, more moisture and it lasted longer. No one expected so much snow to fall from 4 AM this morning until mid-afternoon. Storms usually need to be at roughly 40 degrees latitude and 70 degrees west longitude to give us a major snow event. Meteorologists around here call this the benchmark. If a storm passes near the benchmark, and it's cold enough, we are often in for a good snowstorm. This storm passed hundreds of miles further east than that typical spot for a major snowstorm. One of the reasons I was confident in not seeing this size snowstorm, was the predicted distance of the storm from our area. That prediction by the models turned out to be pretty good. Temperatures were also forecast to be about 4 degrees milder. As it turn out, it’s sort of a good thing it ended up being colder because heavy wet snow of these amounts would have been catastrophic to the power situation.I'll be updating my weather forecasts on Twitter at @growingwisdom please follow me there.
The northern part of the storm acted like a paddle wheel and pushed copious amounts of moisture into the area. This morning, the intensity of the flow of snow from the ocean increased as the storm sat spinning nearly in place to our east. Additionally, as the storm was sitting over the ocean, some extra energy in the atmosphere was riding south into the storm from New York. This helped keep the plume of moisture flowing west towards Massachusetts off the moisture rich ocean. To the north, in southern Maine just a few inches fell and to the south across Connecticut there was not nearly the intensity of snow.
In looking at the satellite photos from this afternoon it also appears that a small storm may have formed west of the main storm. I noticed a circulation south of Nova Scotia and much closer to New England than the main storm. Other meteorologists will have to evaluate this and see what they think. In the absence of surface observations over the ocean, satellite photos are the only real tool to do some evaluating of the storm. Sometimes a new storm can develop on the boundaries created by the initial one. When this happens, it tends to slow down the ending of the precipitation and enhance the amounts.
There were forecasting elements of the storm that were good. The coastal flooding and erosion part of the forecast was ended up happening on schedule. This gave people ample warning about this element
