Hi ladies, Hectic yesterday and today at work with trying to get everything done before tomorrow. I don't like to leave loose ends. Winter, sounds like you have success! tt, sorry your visit wasn't what you hoped for. And Pingo, so nice to see you back!! Thank you everyone for your well wishes. So crazy after 9 months of unemployment, I get a job and 2 months later get a a call about another job I applied to in December! But very happy. Same type of work and this is another great law firm. Plus the financial puts me over what I was making 5 years ago. I worked hard all my life to make a good salary and it was so depressing to go backwards. So I am a happy camper : ) You have chosen to ignore posts from toytrumpet.

Pouliot this year has 5 points in 8 games. Bourque has 5 points in 40 career games. Pouliot stinks and he's still head and shoulders above Bourque (literally and figuratively).

I agree with Dez. Even though Bourque scored the game winner last night, that doesn't mean he's an NHL caliber forward. He reminds me alot of Marchands' first season. The difference is Bourque's 27.

Fierce will probably just blame KG for not putting together a team that can compete! Remember that 2011 series against the Heat? The Celts only won once because Rondo had a broken arm. But when the Celts won, KG had a 20-10 performance. Today, KG only has 9 po

thanks to Moss' best friend, he just keeps dishing out the motivation as a special delivery. He is killin us in the media and KEEP IT COMMING! They think we arent good. they think we made a mistake. they think our offense will be bad now. well then things are back to the way they should be. Prove them wrong again Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. Show these pretenders how a Dynasty is built. Carter on weei was straight up disrespectful. reminds me of tom jackson in 2001

Deion Sanders, who usually leaves his friendships with players at the door, said NE is in no way a playoff team and this move proves NE is quitting on the season.I'd slap that up on the bulletin board before the Baltimore game.Cris Carter isn't very intelligent, though.

The pathetic thing is that I remember him questioning the Pats sanity when they got Moss who he labeled as a malcontent who wouldn't perform. Then when they went undefeated and set the TD record he labeled moss as reformed and BB as a genius for the move. Now BB is an idiot and Moss is a victim. This is why I ignore the meatheads. They'll say what ever they think the viewers will agree with or what their bosses have told them the story line should be.

Packers (and Saints) are about the only teams who can keep up with us in a shootout. But I would say our offense is the best of the three because we have an effective running game.People look at the Packers and Saints, and they think "Oh, Rodgers and Brees won the Super Bowl just throwing all over defenses."That's not accurate. Remember that Packers barely made the playoffs last year. The reason behind their spectacular playoffs run was because they found a good running game during the playoffs behind James Starks.The Saints won the Super Bowl in '09 because they had an effective run game. The following season, they lost to Seattle in the wild card round. The difference: Saints couldn't run the ball effectively in '10.WIth the offense that we have, all we need is some more improvement on defense and I think we stand a great chance against anybody.

Moon - I made this point in another thread but I fell off my seat reading your comment. For 500 At Bats, a .300 average equates to 25 extra hits. Some of those by the law of averages would not only be extra base hits but they would produce some runs that a BB would not. Also, there have been only a handful of players in the history of baseball that have had .400 OBA with BA at or below .250 (M.Bishop in 1930, Mickey Tettleton with 97 BB in 339 official AB's, Gene Tenace with 124 BB in 420 official At bats. If someone had 450 official PA and a .250 average they would have 113 hits. For that player to have a .400 OBA average, they would need 112 BB's to get up to a .400 OBA. That would mean they would have the same number of Walks as hits. Most guys in the history of baseball (99%+) who have OBA of .400 have very high batting averages.

ORLEANS — He was married at 18, a father at 20, divorced at 23. His own father abandoned the family around the time he was born. It took 15 years of night classes for him to earn associate’s and bachelor’s degrees.He has launched a half-dozen businesses or careers, including a 7 1/2-year stint as a Wareham police officer that has become the focus of his opponent’s ferocious attacks in the campaign for the open seat in the 10th Congressional District.To say Jeffrey Davis Perry took an unorthodox route to a career in politics is an understatement.Perry, now 46, a four-term state representative and the Republican nominee in the 10th, is a late bloomer, the product of a working-class upbringing and a tortuous career path.“I’ve enjoyed doing different things in my life, challenging myself, and taking risks,’’ Perry said. “I don’t want to be that guy who’s 85, sitting in a rocking chair, saying I wish I had started a business or run for Congress.’’Heading into the final full week of the congressional race, Perry hopes to ride a surge of enthusiasm among conservatives to Washington and overcome controversial aspects of his past that have dogged his candidacy.Perry was raised by his mother, Mildred, who moved in with her parents in Attleboro after his father left. His grandfather, George W. Davis, was his “de facto father,’’ Perry wrote in “My GOP,’’ self-published last year as a personal political manifesto, outlining his belief in the conservative principles of Ronald Reagan.At 12 or 13, he met his father, Herbert, for the only time, he said.“My mom said, ‘Your father’s here.’ I thought she was joking,’’ he said. “And I went in and this gentleman took his hand out and said, ‘I’m your father,’ and my reaction was, ‘No, you’re not my father,’ and I pointed to my grandfather and locked myself in my room.’’An average student, he said college wasn’t an option after graduating from Attleboro High School in 1982.Instead, Perry worked a series of odd jobs — gas station attendant, laborer, warehouse worker — and enlist

WASHINGTON — A small, controversial effort launched under President George W. Bush to fund and train election monitors in Egypt played a key role in the movement to topple President Hosni Mubarak’s regime.The program, which provided millions in direct funding to prodemocracy groups, helped dispatch 13,000 volunteers to observe Egypt’s parliamentary elections in December. Thousands of those monitors, angered by what they said was blatant election rigging, joined the protests. Some became outspoken leaders; others used the networking and communication skills they learned to help coordinate 18 days of rallies.“The very fact that they saw the fraud firsthand has contributed to them turning from monitors into activists,’’ said Saad Eddin Ibrahim, founder of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies, which has used a share of the US funds to train volunteers. “They became very disillusioned with the regime.’’The evolving role of the monitors provides a measure of vindication for Bush administration officials and allies, including Elizabeth Cheney, the daughter of Vice President Dick Cheney, who fought for permission to funnel money to the monitors, bucking a longstanding US policy of giving Egypt a veto over US funds.“I certainly feel vindicated,’’ said Charles King Mallory IV, a former aide to Elizabeth Cheney, who could not be reached for comment.But it also raises questions about whether some Egyptians will see a grain of truth in Mubarak’s allegations that “foreign intervention’’ fomented the uprising.Stephen McInerney, executive director of the Project on Middle East Democracy, a Washington-based advocacy and research group, said the protesters would probably still have been active without US support, but they wouldn’t be as well-organized.“We didn’t fund them to start protests, but we did help support their development of skills and networking,’’ he said.Mahmoud Ali Mohamed, head of the Egyptian Association for Supporting Democracy, the largest election monitoring organization in Egypt, said his monitors were dispatched to Tahrir Square on the first day of the protests to document attacks on demonstrators.As the protests grew, he opened an operations room from which 320 volunteers took tips from the public about abuses by progovernment forces, and he wrote press releases publicizing attacks and arrests. Now his group is considering launching lawsuits against those who killed or hurt protesters.He said December’s parliamentary election, viewed by many as the most fraudulent in Egypt since the 1970s, galvanized the entire nation.When the government announced that the opposition won less than 12 seats in parliament, down from 95 in 2005, in the first round, Egyptians “understood that there was no fair election,’’ he said.“In a way or another, it helped what is happening right now,’’ he said, speaking through an interpreter in a telephone interview.
The United States began to fund election monitors in Egypt as part of Bush’s push for democratic reform. For decades, the United States hesitated to apply too much pressure to repressive regimes in the Midddle East, believing that stability in the region was more important than democracy. But after the Sept. 11 attacks, Bush said that policy would change. He asserted that repression produces instability in the long run and fuels religious extremism.To bring his vision of promoting democracy to life, Elizabeth Cheney launched a State Department effort to support reforms, known as the Middle East Partnership Initiative, or MEPI.The administration increased funding for good governance and democracy in Egypt, from $3.5 million in 2005 to $55 million in 2008. But in the early years, most funding was channeled through the government, which often undermined the efforts, according to a 2009 report by the inspector general of the US Agency for International Development.For instance, USAID spent $950,000 on civics textbooks for children that Egypt’s Education Ministry did not want to distribute. Funds were also spent on state-run media.So a small group of officials led by Cheney pushed for more than three years for permission to fund independent groups. “We were saying, ‘The situation [in Egypt] cannot hold,’ ’’ recalled Mallory, Cheney’s aide.They faced fierce opposition from career US diplomats who didn’t want to upset a key ally. But in 2005, the initiative provided about $1.2 million in funding for five organizations to train political parties and candidates, strengthen the advocacy skills of civic leaders, and monitor elections. Last year, MEPI gave $1.3 million for such groups.Mohamed said his group received

Mass. Legislature passes ‘upskirting’ ban
The bill banning “upskirting” came a day after the state’s highest court ruled that the state law aimed at prohibiting criminal voyeurism does not apply to taking secret photos up a woman’s skirt. (Produced by Anush Elbakyan, Globe Staff)
