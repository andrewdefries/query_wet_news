In response to BostonBruinss' comment: People must be tired of winning in the playoffs bc thats what will stop if we get rid of Horton. Im so sick of these message boards idiots who thing they know whats good for the team. You are right. No Horton, no wins. Although, I'm not sure how Chicago is winning without Horton.

In response to SoxFanInIL's comment: In response to bostonfan191646's comment: [QUOTE] In response to SoxFanInIL's comment: Ference will be gone at 2.25 Jagr's 1.1 will be gone Peverley and Keel's salaries are a drag... maybe PC gets creative there. And rask's hit this year is 3.5... if gets a multiyear raise to 5, thats only a 1.5 raise. Hortons 5 would only be a 1 mil raise... ?? there was this thing called a lockout and this thing called the salary cap is going down. also, leave and don't come back. I know there was a lockout and that the cap is going down. But all the scenarios seem to calculate +5 for Horton and +5-6 for Rask. Its actually +1 and +1.5. None of them count the other calculations. If the Pens can field an All Star team and even the Wings got their stars to fit into a team concept, I dont see how Horton cant be kept using some creativity. [/QUOTE]it's also +2 for lucic, +2 for marchand, +5ish for seguin (really more like +2 with his rookie bonuses). Sure you subtract for Ference but add the 650K for bart. 1.7 for krug. Maybe do 5 seconds of reading before spouting your idiotic opinions. or just honor your word and don't come back. loser. You have chosen to ignore posts from SanDogBrewin.

In response to islamorada's comment: Detriot will be looking to add a 20 something forward as well. [QUOTE] Toronto will not waste time on the 1st day of free agency, they will out bid all, they will overpay and howl all summer how they stole Horton. There will be planty of teams who drive the price up.
