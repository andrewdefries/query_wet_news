How Boston changed LincolnOn a visit to this abolitionist hotbed, a young congressman had a revelation that would change history.

Buy reprints	A dark, gangly figure emerged from the Boston and Providence Railroad depot in Park Square on Sept. 15, 1848. Except for his unusually lofty, angular frame, Abraham Lincoln would have attracted little notice as he walked the byways of Boston. The obscure 39-year-old freshman congressman was on his first visit to the city and his first venture into presidential politics. Lincoln’s long gait carried him to lodgings at the elegant Tremont House at the corner of Tremont and Beacon, just steps from the bones of Hancock, Revere, and the other patriots in the adjacent Granary Burying Ground.
The Abraham Lincoln who visited Massachusetts in 1848 was not yet leading man m

There is cause to not have confidence. Cupcake regular-season schedule, easy draw versus Denver, Baltimore gave the game away with 2 errors. And the celebration after the "win" where I hear the players say "we are going to the super bowl" as if that were enough. Not to mention Brady's terrible performance, the injury to Gronk, the worst D in history and the Giants gutting out huge wins against #1 and #2 on the road in bad weather. Giants should win this next one as well.

In Response to Re: WOW, are there a lot of worried fans here or what???:[QUOTE]Just saying....Everyone thought the same with the Ravens too right? Im glad so many folks no football. If we win the game its gonna be because we play better. Not revenge! That was 5 years ago and most players are gone. How did the pats do avenging their loss from just 2 years ago??? Yeah, like I said. This wont be easy. Why would we run all over the Giants? WHo else has done that. The Giants may not be the Ravens, but they present their own challenges. The Ravens have a slow D-line and they played guys back to stop the pass and thats why running lanes were open. We will have less luck vs the Giants who will have their backers up at the line and rush their 4 guys. Can we have success running, maybe, but it wont be because of what we did yesterday. These are totally different teams. Micheal Boley is a Beast. JPP, Kiawanuke, Osi, Tuck, these boys get after it. Brady will have to play his best game of the year and our defense will have to find an answer for tha slot position.Posted by JayShizzle45[/QUOTE]But we did get revenge on the Ravens, in spades.We avenged a divisional loss with an AFC Chanpionship loss, and just to rub it in, gave them the taste of overtime and a chip shot FG sent them down in flames.The Ravens must be devastated. Maybe even moreso than a blowout.We have already shown we can play with the Giants. I say it's our turn to steal the win at the last minute.I see the D pulling it out at the end with a fluke tip or something. That would be justice.

Last night as the Giants game was coming to an end and it looked like it was going to be a Patriots vs Giants SB I just felt excitement that the Patriots were going to the SB and now have an opportunity to win the SB. A chance to win is all I ask for at this point and that's exactly what the Patriots get... a chance to do it and thats the way I am going to feel about this SB. The season is extended, the hype is going to be 2 full weeks of SB hype with the Patriots and I'm just going to take it all in and look forward to watching the Pats play in the big game and get that chance. Sure beats watching two weeks of SB hype and a SB game with two teams I couldn't care less about. The Pats have a chance to now beat the team that ruined their 2007 season, that makes all the 2007 SB highlights we will see these next two weeks a bit more bearable to watch now.

September 20, 2013 10:24 PM	Latin Academy's Igbokwe Chenedu brings down Dorchester's Johny Mims during Dorchester's first-ever home football game on Friday night. Latin Academy defeated Dorchester 24-10. (Justin A. Rice / For the Boston Globe)
By Lorenzo Recupero, Globe Correspondent
Dorchester played its first game at its new home field Friday night, but it was Latin Academy that danced off the Roberts Field turf victorious.
Behind a balanced offensive attack and a swarming defense, the Dragons spoiled Dorchester’s home opener, 24-10. Spearheaded by dynamic senior quarterback Kyle Dance’s three touchdowns (2 passing, one rushing), Latin Academy improved to 3-0. “It feels good [getting the win], especially the way they beat us last year, which kept us from going to the Super Bowl,” said Dance, Latin Academy's three-year starter under center. ‘”They were a good team, we came out hard, they came out physical, but I think in the end we did a good job."
Even though Dorchester scored the first ever points on Robert’s field, Latin Academy took the lead in the second quarter and never relinquished it. The first two points were provided by Dorchester middle linebacker Leon Sealy, who sacked Dance in the end zone on third down with just over six minutes to play in the first. “It means a lot, a lot of people didn’t get a chance to play out here ... but it means something to me,” Sealy said of scoring the program's first-ever points on their home field. “Coach sent me on the blitz through the A gap and I just got to the quarterback. That’s about it.'' With 3:45 to play in the first half, Dorchester spit up their first of four fumbles in the game on a pitch inside the 5-yard line. The ball bounced into the end zone before being pounced on by Latin Academy senior defensive lineman Johnson Kellen for the team’s first points of the game. The Dragons, who started the game with an errant snap and an ugly safety, never looked back offensively once their defense gave them a kick start.
“We have talented kids, and when our quarterback has enough time, good things happen for us,” said Latin Academy coach Rocco Zizza, who has watched Dance flourish in both the run game and the passing game this season. “The thing is, so long as the line can give him some time, we have guys who can catch the ball. And the better we run the ball, the easier it is for us to pass the ball.” Dance, who finished the game with 64 rushing yards and 81 passing yards to go along with his three touchdowns, echoed his coaches winning strategy.
“Me being able to run the ball helps keep the defense off balance, so it works out good to our advantage,” he said.
Dorchester showcased six different rushers out the backfield, but had much less success than they are used to. Senior Hakim Harris, who scored the Bear’s only touchdown on a 66-yard rush, finished with a team-high 79 yards on 9 carries.
And although it was Dorchester’s homecoming party, coach Zizza felt his team did what they could to open the field with dignity. “We played as hard as we can and that’s the ultimate form of respect for both Dorchester High and coach Moran,” he said.
