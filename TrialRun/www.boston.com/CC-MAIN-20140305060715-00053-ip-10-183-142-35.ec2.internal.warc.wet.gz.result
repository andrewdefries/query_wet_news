Politics Losing faith in Democrats' religious outreach
FILE- In this Jan. 15, 2007, file photo, then-Sen. Barack Obama , D-Ill., speaks to the St. Mark Cathedral congregation on the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during a birthday celebration in Harvey, Ill. In 2008,Obama took aim at the "pew gap," the overwhelming Republican edge among voters who regularly attend church. The Democratic presidential nominee came nowhere near closing it, but he didn't have to. He just needed an extra percentage point or two among traditional GOP constituents, and he got it. The Democratic National Committee is promising a repeat performance in 2012. But some religious leaders and scholars who backed Obama in 2008 are skeptical. They say the Democrats have, through neglect and lack of focus, squandered the substantial gains they made with religious moderates and worry it will hurt Obama in a tight race against Republican Mitt Romney.
