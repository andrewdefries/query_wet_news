Good morning,Snow again, ss? I can't take anymore. Congrats to you, Winter, for having brought DS up being responsible. We didn't even have to ask our sons to help shoveling; they did it on their own. But we did it with them too to show them, it was a family project. I guess these days it is not cool to help around the house. So sad. When I grew up, it wasn't even a question, it was taken for granted. And that is the way we looked at it, when the boys grew up. Sounds like you had a great time - though exhausting - visiting with the trips, Kar. Your thought of going on a weekend day, so mom and dad can have time together, is a very honorable. But have you ever been alone with a toddler and 3 babies? Wow, you are ambitious. I know, mom does it everyday. But she has gotten the know-how by now. And GT did a quilt? Impressive. Now where is that photo option? Would have loved to see a photo of it. I wouldn't worry about washing it either. I stick mine in my dryer on just air to remove dust and air it out every so often. Or I hang it over my railing on a nice day out. I have never had it on high heat, as Robin suggests, but I don't think it will hurt it, unless it is an old antique one. I am sore all over today. The PT increased my ankle weights yesterday. Was ok yesterday, but I can feel it today. I have just a couple more times to go this round. I know, I will miss it. I do the stretching and some of the exercises at home, but it is not the same. Leaving shortly for the office. Have a good day everyone. You have chosen to ignore posts from GoneToTheDogs39.

Allergies are more common now, wool, dust, dust mites etc. So, if you gave the quilt to a guest to use that was sensitive...they may wake up itchy. I threw out my cheap comforters I got from Building 19, although I washed them from time to time, I suspect the dust mites were quite happy living in the plastic filler stuff in the middle, they didn't bother me, but they bothered my dog with allergies. I now have some cotton type quilts I got at Marshalls that are working out just fine :)

G.T. has made many quilts now, Pingo. I know I posted a picture of the cat and mouse one, the first one, he made for me. Since then he has made them for the beds in their home and now with the little ones, Lilly, and pumpkin, he has made crib size ones, washable, for them. He's working on one for the new little guy now. He's made a lot of drapes for their home too, finding material he likes that fits in with the time period, and as he says, it's all straight stitching. Working with his hands, whether it's gardening, sewing, refinishing furniture, painting, is his relaxation.

Could be an interesting one. The Lightning were beaten up by the Leafs physically a few days ago and will be highly motivated. The B's have not played, it seems, since the last ice age.

In response to damfuno's comment: It has become apparent that while we PP is still a wily player he is not a go to closer anymore. He is the only one that the Celtics can remotely place into that category but can no longer be counted on to be consistent in that role. Without him there is no one else. The Celtics play really hard and well for the first 3 and a half quarters but when crunce time comes we simply do not have that go to guy. All too often over the last two years, this year in particular, PP tries to be the closer he once was but since he is the only possiblitity and, since other teams are aware of this, as soon as he puts the ball on the floor, in comes the double team and all too often his mind takes over where his body cannot and he either forces up a shot, dribbles the ball off his body, throws an errant pass or some other inane play which proves the point. The Celtics simply do not have a closer. I hope that for next season we can get a proven closer.............and as long as we are wishing an effective big. The only ones who don't know this, are Pierce and Doc!!

I know Brady and Branch work very well together. Branch came in last season and him and Brady didn't miss a beat. Seemed like Branch never left. Yet this preseason branch has not caught a pass and has only been targeted once. Do you find this a bit strange?

Pats are slightly in desperate mode to get Johnson up to speed. He is no where near what they thought he would be. Pats also know Branch will play next Monday night like he never missed a beat.I was critical regarding the media and Johnson about 3 weeks ago on this BDC board and got slammed, but I still find it amazing that the media is reporting that Johnson is on Hard Knocks, yet they are not harping on the fact that he still doesn't have the playbook down, he has looked bad in practice, and if not for the $$$, Johnson would have been standing next to Sanders when BB summoned him a couple of days ago. My field of work often has me around

In Response to Re: Dodgers will be unloading contracts and selling soon: Who Should the Red Sox trade for?:[QUOTE]We better not let Ells or Lowrie go. U guys want to dump Lowrie who is batting as good as any MLB short stop for the future of Iglesias who will be a gold glover, but never hit nearly as good as Lowrie? No way.Posted by btownteamsrking[/QUOTE]No way is right. It's nuts to even think of selling Ellsbury and Lowrie. Jed is fast becoming a solid hitter, kills lefties, can play anywhere in the infield while Ells is a 300 hitter who can steal between 60-70 bases a year. Iglesias is a terrific fielder but as all
