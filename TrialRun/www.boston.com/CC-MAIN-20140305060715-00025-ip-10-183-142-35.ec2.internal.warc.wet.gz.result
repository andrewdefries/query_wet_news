Elizabetta was not one of the 3 worst dancers this week. She was last week however. And her demeanor was sour, no one really knows who she is, except that she's Clooney's ex. So where was her support going to come from, George Clooney stalkers? That seems like a very small pool. If it was based on dance alone, then Chaz should've been shown the door. But it's not. Were people dissing Grace? I'll have to reread the thread. I put a couple of "contributors" on ignore, but I only would've done that b/c they were going off topic. I never heard of her, until that Casey Anthony case, but even then I was only getting 3rd hand rants from the political blogs I read. Finally having seen her, I thought she came across as likeable. Her dancing is good enough to keep her going a couple more rounds for sure. In a merit-based system Chaz would be the next to go, but I suspect we have another Bristol situation on our hands, and we'll be seeing the wife-beater outfit for weeks to come. David Arquette, like all the Arquettes, is a very strange bird. I dunno, he was one of the bottom two, and this season the bottom two are the real low scorers for a change. The gay guy is a riot, but I don't think I've ever seen a more uncoordinated person in my life. I'm amazed he can tie his own shoes.

In Response to Re: Dancing with the Stars Season 13:[QUOTE]I didn't see the show Monday night..so caught the condensed version last night. I am not sure why anyone is knocking Nancy Grace..I thought she did a good job and so didn't the judges. Ricki Lake was awesome...I didn't think Clooney's ex girlfriend was bad enough to get booted..I thought there were worse.Posted by miscricket[/QUOTE]Nancy Grace is a troll. Besides looking like a beached whale in a sparkling dress she is a completely unpleasant person. She should have gone.

http://www.boston.com/sports/hockey/bruins/extras/bruins_blog/ Healthy Scratch. Paille up to the third line. Not really sure MacDermid is an upgrade over Bourque in any way. I thought maybe it had something to do with the new "tough Sabres", but other than super agitator Ott and the big goon Scott they really aren't all that tough at all.

It's not so much about MacDermid being an upgrade over Bourque. It's that Paille is an upgrade over Bourque on the third line and that Macdermid doesn't make the fourth line much worse, especially considering the type of game we're all expecting. That's how I see it anyway.

If he is as contrite as people say and wants to finish his career on a positive note this could be a worth looking at on the cheap. He still can split the D and a better outside shot option over Rondo in crunch time. Thoughts?

He's not the answer, but he can be an important piece to the puzzle. If we resign West, we can slide West to the 2 and have A.I. run the back up point.

CINNNYJBUFFMIABALSAN DMINNCLEVPITTINDYDETNYJCHIGBBUFFMIASeeing the way that defense played last night with very little chance of improving any time soon, how far off is my prediction? when the Pats are 1-6 or 2-5, how much pressure do you think there will be on our rooks? How will Gillette stadium sound in November? I just pray they lock up Brady soon or he might not want to stay. Oh yeah, and when Moss leaves, along with having no pass rush or running back, we will no longer have a deep threat.

But it was 14-2 after our preseason game against the Saints, and 12-4 after our preseason game against the Falcons, and if we win good next week does the prognostication change yet again? I mean, does one bad preseason game really spell doom? I don't think so. I certainly hope it doesn't, because we wouldn't even be 8-8 the way they played last night.Oh well, I guess this is why they still make the teams play in the regular season and don't give out playoff slots now. Look on the bright side, if we're in trouble based on one bad preseason game, at least the Colts will be joining us.

Way off.I was half-expecting this to be about the Jets.It won't be an easy schedule, but really, who gets an "easy" schedule in today's NFL? EVERYONE outside of NE is overlooking the Pats, and obviously so are some within the 6 states.With Brady and Belichick the Pats start a few steps ahead of everyone else. A year of seasoning for this young D will only have helped, the TE looks like a position about to rise from it's 6 year slumber, the OLine has surprised everyone, and I expect a good contract year from Moss. Also, Brady has been listening to people doubt the Pats relegating them to second in their own division, questioning if he cares as much as he used to with his family and celebrity status, or even if he's a little gunshy now after a few injury-riddled years. Knowing who this guy is, and what motivates this team...I'm not doubting them. They ROUTINELY used what other's have said in the past as motivation and I've NEVER heard so much doubting. Talk about "no respect", they used that card for a few years when everyone WAS calling them the best, I wonder how they'll respond this year. If I was a gambling man, I'd be taking the Pats in each of the first 6 weeks with whatever spread Vegas determines, and I'll take the OVER on, what I believe is, a 9 win total.
