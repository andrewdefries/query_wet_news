How can Linus, a boy, "choose" an abortion? He's anatomically ineligible. Gotta love those strawmen, though.

Discussions are underway regarding whether to raise the age of draft eligible players to 19. What do you guys think about this issue? I personally would like to see them LOWER the age but keep 18 as the minimum age that you're allowed to play in the NHL. What I mean is that if a team wanted to draft a 15 year old like Tavares for instance(stud at that age),they're welcome to do that but still have to wait until he's old enough to play. Thoughts?http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/juniors/2011/10/20/king_chl_age/

I think it's fine as it is. I wish they would lower the AHL age to 18.

But I am curious as to why you'd want to lower the draft age. It's a cr@p shoot now with 18 yr olds, so why?I'd prefer they raised it. From what I saw, Seguin could have used another year in Junior. Same with Hall. It's just that they have a long time ahead as adults, and a very short time as kids. You have chosen to ignore posts from dezaruchi.

Statement of Joseph Kennedy E-mail|Link|Comments ()
September 7, 2009 03:52 PM
I want to thank the millions of Americans who have expressed their love and admiration for Senator Kennedy over the last few weeks. It was very moving to see so many people come out to pay their respects to a man who fought so hard to make this world a better place, especially for those struggling for life's basic needs � a decent home, a living wage, a safe neighborhood, their daily bread, a good education, and access to health care.
Given all that my uncle accomplished, it was only natural to consider getting back involved in public office, and I appreciate all the calls of support and friendship that have poured in.

My father called politics an honorable profession, and I have profound respect for those who choose to advance the causes of social and economic justice in elective office. After much consideration, I have decided that the best way for me to contribute to those causes is by continuing my work at Citizens Energy Corporation.
Our efforts cover a broad array of the challenges facing this country � to heat the homes of the poor, install energy-savings technologies to cut costs for homeowners and businesses, build wind farms throughout the United States and Canada to lessen our dependence on foreign oil, and construct transmission lines to carry new sources of renewable energy.
