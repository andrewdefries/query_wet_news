While a freshman at the Stratton Mountain School in Vermont, Carolyn Beckedorff had just finished her first ski race when a teammate came running to her, calling her name. The 14-year-old Beckedorff spun around to accept congratulations. "Carolyn," exclaimed her teammate, "you were skiing so slow!""That was my introduction to ski racing," says Beckedorff with a laugh.Beckedorff can smile about the memory now. Some 28 years later, no one would dare put the word "slow" and the name of the reigning FIS masters slalom champion in the same sentence. At 42, Beckedorff is a dazzling, and dominating, presence on New England's Sise Cup masters ski racing circuit, running the gates with a surgeon's precision and the full-throttle agility of a BMW. The 5-foot-4-inch, 135-pound dynamo is also a wife, a mother, and a successful stock trader for a Boston brokerage firm."Uber mom sums it up," says her husband and coach, Tony DiGangi. "Because, in addition to everything else, all her training, she's the best mom in the world."While Beckedorff shies from the term "uber mom," she packs more into her weeks than many people do in a month.

"Ever since I was a little kid, I was ultra-organized and very driven," she says. "Whether that came from my parents or my family lineage, I don't know. But I've always been that way. I've always been interested in making it all work. I'd be lying if I didn't say there are days when I sit back and ask, 'What are you doing?' But we figure out how to make it all work."Early to ski, late to race Growing up in Wellesley, Beckedorff started skiing when she was only 3, her family heading north to Stowe in Vermont on a regular basis. When she was 13, the ski-racing bug bit, and she started inquiring about ski academies, including the Green Mountain Valley School and Burke Mountain Academy in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom. Her parents steered her toward Stratton Mountain School."Now that I'm a mom, looking back on it, I'm sure they were really sad that I wanted to leave home at 13," says Beckedorff. "Because they knew someone at Stratton, I decided to just look there,
