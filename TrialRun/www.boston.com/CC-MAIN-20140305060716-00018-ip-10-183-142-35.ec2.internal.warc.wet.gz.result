I am waiting for a meeting that is running late... but just saw on my calendar that it is officially June, so I thought I would start the post!! I had my last medical appt last week, so no new medical updates, but lots more strong movement and wiggling. Although we are supposed to sleep on our lefts for babies' sake, mine does not like it- he can't get comfortable or something... so no more of that.And we set up the nursery this weekend. I still have a few things to do like curtains and such, but the furniture is all in place. I have 8.5 weeks left, so it is perfect timing, but it was very exciting. Made it all seem more real.

Fun! We have our furniture and the walls are painted, but DH is putting up wainscoting/shelves and we need blinds for the skylight, curtains, etc ... my next OB appointment is this week, then I think the Glucose Test is the one thereafter ... which seems a bit late as I'm 25 weeks this week. Is that done at 28, do people remember offhand? Feeling pretty good overall, though! Hoping you ladies are in the same boat. You have chosen to ignore posts from Brighton1.

20 weeks here. Had the u.s. on Friday and had the exact same situation that many of you had - they weren't able to get all 9 views of the heart, so have to go back for another at 24 weeks. I'm not complaining at another chance to see the bean! Although I am glad that I had read here about that being quite a common occurrance, or I probably would have been worried.Hmm... thinking I should start to think about furniture, etc...

GC- my glucose was paired with an office visit as well, and I am not on even week dates... so I think that mine was 27 weeks (the next option was 31)Brighton- congrats!! not on the nausea, but on being pregnant!Poppy- I was one of the heart repeaters. The second one, because they are just looking at smaller details, is much quicker... so be prepared (I was hoping for the same 45 minutes to longingly adore him- it was really quick- like 5 minutes). and it is time to start looking at furniture, one of the gliders we liked was 6 to 8 weeks to order and receive (and then you have to assemble it)... I decided I wanted to guarantee we had it BEFORE we had the baby and we had to choose another one. Really sad that is how it works for nursery

Unfortunately this is an ongoing issue with both of these blokes. Amendola is far too fragile.

In response to Not-A-Shot's comment: In response to BabeParilli's comment: [QUOTE] I've been mulling over the prospect of whether we should trade Gronk. He just really doesn't seem to care much about the NEP. Based on what? He's injured and doesn't want to be rushed back before he feels he's ready. The team doesn't care about him. They care about the bottom line. He cares about himself. That makes the team a company and Gronkowski a person. Yeah, let's advocate a trade based on that. [/QUOTE]I'm not a "The Rob Gronkowskis" fan, I'm a "The New England Patriots" fan. I put the company before the employee. Always have, always will. And this employee leaves much to be desired at this point. Of course the team cares about him. Why the hell would they want their multi-millions of dollars investment be at risk for game 4 of the regular season unless the risk was minimal? What is becoming clearer by the year is that Gronk could care less about this team, not that the team doesn't care about him. Somehow he is always either hurt, or doing something questionable. And the going out on the field and looking like a HOFer is a part-time gig he dabbles in. If he does not play tomorrow, he will have missed 9 of his last 20 possible starts. That's an almost 50% problem. We can disagree, but I'm saying his act is getting tired and old. He was an injury risk when he was drafted, and that risk is coming home to roost.

In response to Brad34's comment: Unfortunately this is an ongoing issue with both of these blokes. Amendola is far too fragile. No he isn't. I was told on here before the season started that he isn't injury prone. That he only had 2 "freakish" injuries that kept him out of games and that he will be great for this team.

There was a time where I thought he was way too arrogant and at times a prima donna, but even though things haven't gone well for Beckett last few starts, I appreciate him even more as a quality pitcher and teammate for Sox. He doesn't hold back in his quotes, and he takes responsibility for his own mistakes. As much as I don't care for Lackey, for different reasons, I find myself rooting more and more for Beckett to do well. I understand his importance to the team and I realize he's not as dominating when he was young, but he's still a better pitcher overall. I think he could have gotten away with the loss of control of his fastball later in that game. He should have gone curve instead of a 3-2 fastball on the walk preceding the inside the park homer, but that's again just a thing he will do as he adjusts to using more of his stuff rather than just be a "power" pitcher. He's capable, and he will be a good pitcher for a long time if he keeps in shape. I hope he stays a Sox for the rest of his career, and maybe he'll get another shot if the Sox do somehow win WC.

New England vacations 18 tons of steel shake, rattle, and roll up Mount Washington

BRETTON WOODS, N.H. -- At 10 sharp one morning last month, Mark ''Cookie" Sodergren yanked twice on the whistle lever, released the forward steam valve, spun the brake wheel free, then throttled up locomotive No. 10.Like a dragon cut loose, 18 tons of fire-breathing steel lurched forward for yet one more charge up the Mount Washington Cog Railway. One of the cog stable, Kroflite rattled, shook, belched, and wheezed, pounding home with attitude that the care and feeding of the world's oldest cog railway remains a Sisyphean labor of sooty love.The summer season for this New England icon opened last weekend with a fleet of seven temperamental steam engines. They appear to have been constructed from leftovers; some are prone to pouting, others just plain stubborn. All the engines, however, celebrate the ingenuity of not only the forefathers who dreamed up a way to mechanically assault a scenic mountain, but also the half-dozen mechanics who continually come up with ways to keep these elderly beasts alive. For some, the effort is passionate.''Steam is as near as you can get to a living animal that man has created," said Nigel Day, a 47-year-old Welshman. ''These animals breathe, make noises, eat, drink, and throw tantrums. They are steel, alive."Two of the engines date to the 1870s, and not for the better part of a century has there been a catalog in the world offering new components for the likes of Ammonoosic (No. 2) and Agiocochook (No. 3). Yet on these engines, and all of their younger siblings, piston rings must be replaced every two years, pistons every four years, main axles every five. In fact, nothing on any locomotive is original; all the machines are in a constant state of being rebuilt, then rebuilt again, almost always with parts made or finished on the premises.The newest engineering plans on file were drafted in 1904; for blueprints the mechanics use accumulated wisdom. But the task is not always a mechanical archeological expedition.One engine this summer will feed on bio-fuel for the first time in cog history. Designers expect that a diet of vegetable oil mixed with diesel will substantially reduce air pollution and add horsepower. Another engine will be sporting fancy new chrome-plated piston shafts, nitrite-coated axles, and some Teflon-braided plumbing, all in hopes of
