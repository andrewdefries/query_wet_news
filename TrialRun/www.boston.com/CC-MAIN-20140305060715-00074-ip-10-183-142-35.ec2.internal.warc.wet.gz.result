2 whole preseason games, and no fatalities yet caused by Darko.................wonder what Tommy has to say about that..........doesn't matter, becuase according to the "expert", Darko will be gone by Christmas, and Ramon Sessions will "easily" average 13 points and 10 assists as a laker. Can't believe the T-Wolves let Darko go, as according to Tommy, he is their all-time leading scorer..............that's like letting Jeter go....man, where is the loyalty in this world??

I was in Miami, but on family time. I had every intention of going to the hip cocktail joints, maybe even sip on Rose Champagne in an elegant hotel lounge.
Real life intervenes. I did have a great time at two old school restaurants off the beaten path that have both been around since the 1950s- the Rustic Inn Crabhouse in Ft. Lauderdale (we went right after airport arrival), and Captain's Tavern in Kendall, Miami. I was also offered a crystalized lime packet with my Corona on the plane- that's kinda mixology right? I'm going to make a gimlet with it- or a Jet Blue lime rickey.
Rustic Inn Crabhouse, Ft. Lauderdale
Anyway, leave it up to the cool kids of Island Creek Oysters, down for the South Beach Wine and Food Festival, to pick up my dropped baton and run with it. Shore Gregory, CJ Husk, Chris Serman, Jess Fortin, Dana Hale and PR cutie Nicole Kanner took over as I flew out of town. Their mission? Let me know about The Broken Shaker- it just so happened they would be shucking oysters there for an event at the hotel.

KEY WEST, Fla. -- You're on a quest to find the old Key West, the one before Starbucks, Banana Republic, and CVS dropped their commercial anchors into this colorful tropical bohemia. Then you see a sign, maybe the sign, that seems to point the way.''A last little piece of old Key West," reads a rooftop banner above the Schooner Wharf Bar, a weathered watering hole covered in fish netting.The place has the look and feel of an old fishing boat or a tiki hut on Gilligan's Island with its tattered stools and tables. It feels almost like
