She reported $3000.

I don't care if it's Obama himself. How can you blame him for trying to make as much hay as he possibly can. This whole "war on BC" started after Santorum's spiel about the evils of contraception following the mandate to the church. Plus the fact that Dan(?) Issa held his comittee meeting about BC without a single woman on the panel. I don't care how right or wrong his reasons were but it did not look good at all! This whole contraversy was delivered to Obama gift wrapped and Rush put a pretty bow on it. You are right though, no one, public or pri

In response to zbellino's comment: Tebow would be a nightmare in the CFL. There aren't as many checks and reads, but to be in the CFL you have to be able to throw and have a quick release. It's a throwing league. I would go for the Rugby offer that was given to him. You can make a decent career of that. And he really does have a Rugby build/athleticism/intelligence (lack thereof). I thought you were sick of talking Tebow?

For me, the most logical conclusion is: The Pats see significant value in Tebow's versatility as a player who could be a stop gap in many ways for the team, including off field intangibles for brand fidelity. Tim appears to be standing his ground and does not want to try to play any other position aside from QB. Read his departure tweets. BB and staff likely see so much intangible value that they were willing to allow the process of camp to develop with hopes that Tim would give in to the prospect of being a utility player. He wouldn't and as such, BB decided, OK, have it your way, Good luck, Tim. BB and JM see his value in his versatility, but not as a fulltime QB. They had hoped he would see it over a full preseason under their tutelage and by working next to THE NFL QB, TB as a reality check. Tim's has unwavering desire and maybe his unusually strong faith has got him believing in a potential miracle that could fulfill his NFL QBing dream. BB is obviously more realistic. Though to most, my use of "logical conclusion" will sound rediculous under these circumstances. But when you consider Tim's strength and committment to his trust in God, he knows that it is possible in his heart as he is a soldier for God. Maybe he sees giving in only shows a crack in his life's foundation, HIS TRUST IN GOD. For most of us, "Oh, come on!" is a likely response to this theory. For the strongest of believers, "This is an opprotunity that God may choose to use me in to prove that he is real." Rediculous? Time will tell. You have chosen to ignore posts from skinnyrexraptor.

Rally , brother, I love ya dude, and we share a deep and unabiding dislike for the talents of one R9R, and I actually agree with your readout of the TT issue...but I have to fully agree with BB on this one...If JC is going to work a miracle for TT, he better bless him with the passing ability of Willie Joe Namath, or it's a no go...

I am with you and BB! Please know that I see this apparent use of faith by TT as a "look at me" stunt and find it very misplaced, but I can't help but to try to understand his perspective.......He is an absolute mystery in so many ways.

In response to stillgridlocked's comment: Wow, a Tebow thread disguised as 'Quarterbanks'. He's cleared waivers and no one has picked him up. Thats as damning as it gets. He sucks. Who thinks this is a conspiracy because the NFL is secretly owned by the devil? Agreed! Wish him the best of luck as he gets on with his life but do not want to hear or read of his name any more on the Patriots forum . . . time we looked and started talking about what QB we put on the practice squad for practice during the week!
