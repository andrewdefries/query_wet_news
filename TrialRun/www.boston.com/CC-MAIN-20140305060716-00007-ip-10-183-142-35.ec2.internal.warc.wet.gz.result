Hi all Pats fans friends and foes!
Bet you all thought I would pull a "RUSTY" and just disappear after suc a bad show last Sunday...of course not! I am no fair weather fan nnor poster and I am here win lose or draw just like always
I know my fans here wouldn't want it any other way : )
very bad show and no excuses-even key injuries and rookies etc are no reason for such poor and almost disinterested play-waaay too much talent to ever look that bad but maybe not enough pride?
perhaps after 10 years Coughlin's voice isn't working, perhaps it's just one of those years where it won't come together...but abandon ship? never! i still see 9-10 wins and the playoffs-why not that is what being a fan is all about after all!
and no Queenie it's got nothing to do with the cap and not much to do with drafting either-would that every coach and "GM" could stumble upon an all-timer his scout discovers and insists he signs and could also play in a perrenially bad division....alas that is just not to be : (
well I am here, not q***r but will never disappear Pats fans so fear not-and GO GIANTS!
Love and Kisses Your Pal Jints

In Response to Re: Right handed Power Hitter?:[QUOTE]I don't think the club is too stressed about the lefty heavy line-up. Ortiz mashed lefties last year, and Ellsbury and Gonzalez were very solid. I don't think it is worth a Soriano or a Jones just to have a rightie platoon power bat in the lineup. Now, if they can go get Cespedes ...Posted by SpacemanEephus[/QUOTE]I would also love to see Cespedes in Sox uniform IF Sox can get him.. Let me just throw this out. Don't have to be serious.Salty for Jerry Sands. I don't know...

Right now, we have several hitters that hit LHPs very well (or with some, at least better than they hit RHPs):Pedey (1.010 OPS in '11) but he hasn't always hit LHPs better.Youk (.987) but he can't seem to stay healthy for a whole year.Lava (.980) Very small sample size and may start in AAA.Aviles (.888) May platoon in OF if Youk is healthy.DMac (.804) Has hit lefties well with Boston, but fielding issues...Scutaro (.775) Hits RHPs almost as well.LHBs vs LHPsPapi (.989) but had 4 straight steep decline years prior.Ellsb &n
