NEW YORK—The Associated Press takes a look at the best and worst first-round draft picks for each NFL team:AFCBALTIMORE RAVENSBest: T Jonathan Ogden, UCLA, 1996Selected with the team's first-ever pick after the move from Cleveland, Ogden held down the left tackle spot through 2006, was selected to 11 Pro Bowls and was a star on 2000 Super Bowl champions.Worst: WR Travis Taylor, Florida, 2000Taken 10th overall, Taylor battled injuries and never became the big-play wideout Ravens envisioned in five seasons in Baltimore. BUFFALO BILLSBest: DE Bruce Smith, Virginia Tech, 1985With some question whether Smith or Ray Childress was worthy of the No. 1 pick, the Bills went with Smith, who became the NFL's sack leader and cornerstone of a defense on a team that won four straight AFC championships.Worst: LB Tom Cousineau, Ohio State, 1979Touted linebacker selected first overall who never played a game for the Bills due to a contract squabble and better offer from the CFL. He played seven NFL seasons elsewhere and was never selected to the Pro Bowl. CINCINNATI BENGALSBest: T Anthony Munoz, Southern California, 1980Chosen third overall, Munoz ended up in the Hall of Fame as one of the top offensive linemen ever. He made 11 Pro Bowls from 1980-92 and helped the Bengals reach both of their Super Bowls as the main protector for QBs Ken Anderson and Boomer Esiason.Worst: RB Ki-Jana Carter, Penn State, 1995Bengals moved up to take him first overall and gave him a then-record $7.1 million signing bonus. Owner Mike Brown called him the team's "bell cow." Tore ACL in his left knee on his third preseason carry in Detroit, ending the season and starting a career cut short by injuries at every turn. Brown also mispronounced his name as "Ji-Kana" at the team's preseason luncheon that year. CLEVELAND BROWNSBest: RB Jim Brown, Syracuse, 1957Arguably the greatest running back in NFL history, some say he may be best player at any position. Sixth pick overall, Brown rushed for 12,312 yards and 126 touchdowns before retiring at the peak of career to pursue acting. A powerful runner with breakaway speed, Brown was rookie of year, three-time player of the year and nine-time Pro Bowler.Worst: DE Courtney Brown, Penn State, 2000Injuries doomed the talented, soft-spoken Brown, the top overall choice. Had surgery on right knee in 2001 and left knee in 2002 and 2004. Missed 33 games in his final four seasons with Cleveland.
