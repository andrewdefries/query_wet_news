‘Virtuality’’ is an exercise in futility, but not because it’s bad. Indeed, this two-hour sci-fi presentation, tonight at 8 on Channel 25, has plenty going for it. A drama about 12 astronauts on a 10-year space journey to find an alternative to a drowning Earth, it made me want to see more.And that’s where the futility comes into the picture. “Virtuality,’’ created by “Battlestar Galactica’’ writers Ronald D. Moore and Michael Taylor, was originally meant to be a two-hour pilot for a full-length series. But the series didn’t get picked up, and so Fox has decided to air the chunk as if it’s a self-standing event.It definitely isn’t. The end of “Virtuality’’ tonight isn’t sloppy so much as it’s actually a beginning. Character introductions have been made, plots have been set in motion, huge mysteries have been raised. Now what?

Lifestyle Bostonian of the year
The Life of the party: Scott Brown
By winning "the Kennedy seat," the Republican shocked the political world and inspired a legion of long-shot challengers.
(Brendan Smialowski for The Boston Globe)
More than once in his first year in office, Scott Brown broke with party leadership. For example, he endorsed the repeal of the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.

This much is worth remembering: When he entered the national consciousness, he was considered something of a lightweight. Sure, he was camera-ready – a handsome, fit guy surrounded by an attractive family. But as someone asking the people to send him to conduct the serious business of the United States Senate, he had little in the way of a legislative record. On the podium, he was more than a bit wooden, delivering halting lines like a high school jock going through the motions in his run for student council. And the jock label fit. Even though he graduated from a competitive college, he had distinguished himself on campus as an athlete, not a scholar. In the special election to fill the seat of Massachusetts’s most famous senator, his main obstacle was a credentialed Democrat who had earned a reputation for competence as the state’s attorney general. The prospect of this neophyte ascending to the Senate threw members of the intellectual class into fits of apoplexy.Yet in the art of retail politics, the agreeable guy with the handsome face was a star, quickly establishing himself as the superior candidate. It was more than just the stamina he showed in shaking hand after hand after hand. It was the pleasant doggedness and smiling ease with which he did it. He clearly liked campaigning because he clearly liked people. And people clearly liked him.So the people of Massachusetts sent that perceived lightweight, named Ted Kennedy, to Washington. In that special election of 1962, Kennedy was able to leverage his likability (and his connections) to cream Democratic Attorney General Edward McCormack in the primary en route to assuming his famous brother’s Senate seat.It was nearly half a century later when Scott Brown did the same. In the special election of 2010, the candidate stunned the anointed but flat-footed Democratic attorney general, Martha Coakley – and the nation – to win what he referred to as “the people’s seat,” but which everybody else continued to call “the Kennedy seat.”Ted Kennedy’s second and third acts loomed so large – the scandal-soaked survivor of Camelot, the liberal lion of the Senate – that people tend to forget his first act. Back then, Kennedy had been discounted by everyone around him, including his own brothers, and derided by a Harvard professor as “a fledgling in everything except ambition.”Improbably, that fledgling grew into one of the most effective if polarizing senators in the history of that old man’s club. And when Brown won his election in January and took over the seat that had long been held by the embodiment of the American left, he, just as improbably, became a figure of national importance.
Most freshman senators are forced to toil for years in obscurity, paying their dues. Brown, as the 41st Republican, would be able to stymie the Democrats’ supermajority in the Senate. That made him a player from the moment he set foot in D.C. He was courted by both parties, trailed by media hordes, and saw his face splashed on the covers of national magazines. Most freshman senators are given the least desirable office space. Brown, finishing Kennedy’s term, moved right into the late senator’s highly coveted suite in the Russell Senate Office Building, with its marble fireplace and a third-floor balcony offering views of the Capitol so sweeping that it is a sought-after backdrop by TV camera crews.Will Scott Brown go on to become a transformative political figure like Ted Kennedy, a senator whose name keeps company with the likes of Webster and Clay? Before you dismiss the idea, consider how outlandish it might have seemed had the same question been posed about the youngest Kennedy after his first year in office.Or will the 51-year-old Brown turn out to be simply a transitional figure, a one-hit wonder remembered vaguely as that former nude Cosmo model who once snared the seemingly bluest seat in the country for Team Red?It’s way too soon to tell. But this much we know: Scott Brown had a profound impact on national politics in the last year. His surprise victory upended conventional wisdom, inspired a legion of long-shot challenges, and energized Republicans and Democrats alike. Brown’s election showed the country that anything is possible, that no seat or incumbent is safe from challenge. And his maneuvering once in office produced the tiniest rays of bipartisanship in a Senate dark with dysfunction. For all of these reasons, he is our 2010 Bostonian of the Year.IN THE FALL OF 2009, nearly every political observer in the country was operating under the assumption that whoever won the Democratic primary in Massachusetts’s special election would cruise to victory in the general. After all, a Republican hadn’t won a US Senate seat in the Bay State since 1972, and it certainly wasn’t going to flip to the GOP now. Not with all those tearful remembrances for Kennedy still echoing. Not with the Democrats’ needing the seat to prevent President Obama’s agenda from being derailed. Not with health care reform, the president’s chief domestic priority and the issue Kennedy had repeatedly called the cause of his lifetime, hanging in the balance.Yet Brown pressed ahead. And when heir apparent Martha Coakley easily won the Democratic primary, in accordance with the script, and everyone figured it was just a matter of time before she’d be measuring the drapes for her new office, Brown kept plugging away. Even after Coakley stumbled on the stump – her complaint to the Globe about the pointlessness of shaking voters’ hands while “standing outside Fenway Park, in the cold” has to be the best gift-wrapped line for an opponent since “Read my lips!” – most analysts still thought she’d survive. Surely, the air of inevitability, combined with the Democratic Party apparatus, would see her through.
What that prediction overlooked was how Brown was showing himself to be a more worthy heir to Kennedy’s campaigning legacy than was Coakley. For Brown, as for Kennedy, the personal side of politicking, the pressing the flesh, never seemed like a chore, but rather the essence of the enterprise. That ability to connect with voters and that willingness to sweat in pursuit of an ambitious goal allowed Brown to rewrite the narrative. And he skillfully tapped into a Massachusetts electorate where the majority of voters are now unenrolled, meaning they’re more likely to focus on individual candidates than party affiliation.
