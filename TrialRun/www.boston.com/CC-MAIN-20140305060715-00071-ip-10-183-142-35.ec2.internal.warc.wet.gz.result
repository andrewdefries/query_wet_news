AVON Dan Lynch, senior district representative for US Representative Stephen F. Lynch, will be at Town Hall from 10 a.m. to noon Feb. 11 to meet with constituents. Anyone wishing to discuss local or legislative issues is welcome to drop in. Lynch, who grew up in South Boston and has offices in Washington, Brockton, and Boston, represents the Ninth District of Massachusetts, which includes towns in Bristol, Norfolk, and Plymouth counties, as well as areas of Boston. - Joan WilderBRIDGEWATER ELECTION PROCESS UNDERWAY - Nomination papers for the April 25 town election are available in the town clerk's office. Offices on the ballot include a one-year and a three-year term on the Board of Assessors; a three-year term on the Board of Health; two three-year terms for selectman; a three-year term for moderator; five-year terms, one on the Planning Board and one on the Recreation Commission; a three-year library trustee seat; a three-year term for Water and Sewer Commission; a Bridgewater representative and a Raynham representative on the regional School Committee; and three-year terms for tax collector and town treasurer. The collector and treasurer positions are currently both held by Douglas Dorr, who has drawn papers to run again. He may have a challenger for at least one of those offices. Resident Andrew Harding drew nomination papers for tax collector. - Christine LegereBROCKTON EXTENDING EDUCATION - Massasoit Community College students planning careers in education and management can continue their education without leaving campus, thanks to a new relationship between the two-year school and Quincy's Eastern Nazarene College. A bachelor of arts in management and a bachelor of education are the first two degrees offered at the Massasoit satellite, part of Eastern Nazarene's adult and graduate studies program. Eastern Nazarene has also launched satellites at Roxbury and Bristol Community Colleges.- Steve HatchCANTON HANSEN PRINCIPAL LEAVING - After 14 years at the helm of the Hansen Elementary School, principal Bill Griffin will step down at the end of the school year in June. "It's been a big part of my life; I really love coming to see the kids," said Griffin, who added that he is focusing his full attention on having a great year and is not thinking about what he will do in retirement. He has been an educator for 35 years and served 24 of them as a principal. A native of Quincy, Griffin, 59, worked in the Milton public schools before coming to the Hansen School. School Committee member Tim Brooks said he is part of a hiring committee that hopes to select a new principal candidate by late March. "Bill's such a good guy; it's going to be hard to replace him," Brooks said. The Hansen has about 490 students in kindergarten through Grade 5.
- Elaine Cushman CarrollCARVER RIDING STABLE PROPOSED - The Planning Board will hold a hearing Feb. 3 on plans by Laura Moore to build a riding stable at 86 Plymouth St. Plans filed with the board call for building a 19,000-square-foot stable that could house as many as 20 horses, with an apartment above it. The site lies within the town's historic district and calls for the demolition of an old house currently on the property, which the town's Historic District Commission has tried to save in the past. The Planning Board meets at 7 p.m. in Town Hall. - Robert KnoxDEDHAM SNOW EMERGENCY RULES - Selectmen want to remind residents of the procedure to follow during a snow emergency, once one is declared by the town's director of public works. Residents with driveways are asked to use them and remove all cars from the street. Those without driveways may park on the even side of the street during the even-numbered months and on the odd side of the street during the odd-numbered months. Parking on sidewalks is never allowed. On-street parking is prohibited from dawn to dusk in the following areas: East Street (High Street to Route 128), High Street, Common Street, Dedham Square, East Dedham Square, Bussey Street, Milton Street, Ames Street, Court Street, Sprague Street, Oakdale Square, Washington Street (Dedham line to Westwood line), Needham Street, and Sanderson Avenue. - Michele Morgan BoltonEAST BRIDGEWATER DOG GETS RESTRICTIONS - Following a recent hearing, selectmen ordered a Hillcrest Road dog restricted to a kennel with a floor and roof. The large, mixed-breed dog, named Justice and belonging to Nikol Phillips, must also be muzzled while on walks and only be walked by adults. Selectmen put the restriction in place after learning from Animal Control Officer Donna Morris that the animal had killed a cat owned by a neighbor. - Christine LegereEASTON LIBRARY AGREEMENT REACHED - The library and the town have settled the question of rent for the use of Frothingham Hall while the Ames Free Library's building is renovated. The library will pay $500 a month to use Frothingham Hall. The Barrows Street building was acquired last year by the town, which plans to house the Recreation Department and Council on Aging there. The library moved into Frothingham in September 2007 and was paying the Frothingham Memorial Corp. $2,000 a month. The library had hoped the rent would be waived when the town became the landlord, but a lease was required under state law, and the new agreement took effect Jan. 1. The library's 15 Main St. building is undergoing $1.2 million in renovations. - Steve HatchFOXBOROUGH NEW FIRE CHIEF NAMED - Roger Hatfield, 47, former fire chief in Nashua, has been chosen as the new fire chief.

Patriots statement
Email|Link|Comments (21)
Posted by Mike Reiss, Globe Staff
April 23, 2008 04:07 PM	The Patriots released the following statement today:
"The New England Patriots are pleased to learn that Matt Walsh is finally willing to come forward to meet with the NFL. We are eagerly anticipating his honest disclosures to Commissioner Goodell next month and the return of all the materials he took during his time of employment. We fully expect this meeting to conclude the league�s investigation into a damaging and false allegation that was originally levied against the team on the day before this year�s Super Bowl. It is important to note that there has never been a confidentiality agreement restricting Matt Walsh and no legal protections were ever necessary for him to speak to the NFL, to media outlets or to anyone else regarding his employment with the Patriots. He demanded to be released from responsibility for his statements, and after a frustrating and lengthy negotiation period, a settlement has finally been reached. Walsh has been granted a significant number of privileges through this agreement, none of which the Patriots or the NFL were obligated to give.
At all times, we cooperated fully with the league�s investigation and stand by our initial public statement from Saturday, Feb. 2, 2008: �The suggestion that the New England Patriots recorded the St. Louis Rams� walkthrough on the day before Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002 is absolutely false.�
The Patriots� organizational focus at this time is on the NFL Draft and preparing for what we hope will be an exciting 2008 season. We will have no further comments regarding Matt Walsh at this time."

Excellent statement New England, especially the part about a damaging and false allegation about the Patriots taping the Rams walk through.

I work in the print media here in the UK and reading that, I think the Pats may very well sue the Herald over that original story. That phrase used in the above statement - 'damaging and false allegation' - is key. That sentence may be foreshadowing of a legal case once this Walsh nonsense is cleared up.
If I was the reporter who wrote the original piece, I would be very, very worried.
Incidentally, I'm not making any special pleading for the reporter who wrote the offending piece, but Ive been sued before in the course of my work, and often the reporter is not strictly to blame for what appears in print - its sometimes the higher-ups who demand stories are run - but its not their name in the byline and its not them who cops the flak!
Interesting statement, all the same.
