OK I freaking hate it when we start dribbling and trotting up court, no lead is safe when we do this. We can't play catch for 18 seconds and go into last shot offensive mode. Doc needs to stop holding back, we need to keep pushing the pace both ways. Rondo and Sully are gone , we have to have balanced shots and movement. We won't even make the playoffs if we play 3 on 5 half court offense. We build big leads with everyone clicking and then Doc has to put the ball in KG,PP and Terry 99% of the clock every trip playing slog ball. This kills our momentum, squanders leads and leads to tough shot for all 3 because the only passes to anyone else will be bail out passes.

I like her chances.I am standing on the top step of the aluminum bleachers, approximately 30 feet away from Brady, who is answering questions posed by about 200 reporters. To my left, there's a guy decked out in some kind of Carnac the Magnificent costume. He is trying to shout over all the other reporters every time Brady finishes an answer.Miss Nevada does not shout. She just stands there in her bare-midriff outfit, sash across her chest (that's how I deduced that she is Miss Nevada), hand raised, emerald-green eyes trained on Brady. I wonder if she is cold. But I do not wonder if she's going to get an opportunity to ask her question. Instincts and anecdotal evidence tell me that Brady is going to notice Miss Nevada in this sea of guys shaped like sacks of inner tubes.Sure enough, the first time Brady's head rotates in our direction, he points to Miss Nevada."I was wondering," she starts. "Being Tom Brady, you must get proposed to a lot. How many marriage proposals do you get a year?""It just ha
