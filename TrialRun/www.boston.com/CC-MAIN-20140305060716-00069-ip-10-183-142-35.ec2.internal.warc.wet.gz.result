Aldo and his master, Steve, are ardent readers of The Globe here in Orlando. They are both depressed about the state of affairs of the Red Sox, the Celtics' non-season, the slow start of the Bruins, and season-long loss of Defense of the Patriots. At least Harvard football is one bright star in the New England college scene. You have chosen to ignore posts from BDCKristi.

Belated Happy Birthday, William.What section will you and William be meandering through, Ache? Cheerio enjoys a stroll through the arboretum, tho she prefers later in the day, when the sun has had a chance to warm things up. I'd really like to get a snapshot of the two of them together, and I'm sure the girls on CC would enjoy seeing it too.

Oh, what a glorious idea, tt. Too bad we didn't live closer; Gracie loves parties and gets along with dogs and cats alike, especially her buddy Cheerio. Yes, Ache, wouldn't it be nice for William and Cheerio to have a play date and photo op.

Count me in. Amber hasn't had a date in years. Does William like "more mature" ladies? If Cheerio is going, then there is no way I can stop the boys. What time today??

William appreciates your kind birthday wishesWe rambled the entire Arboretum today. His favorite section as always was the Rose Garden. Pretty flat and wide open there. Plenty of room for him to run around and have fun in. He also enjoyed the workout he got on the steep inclines of Hemlock HillNot many cats at the Arboretum. Cheerio may feel a little out of place. William looks forward to meeting her though

Posted by ambergirl[/QUOTE]When I want William to pose for me, I dont bribe him with treats like you-know-who does with her spoiled petI dont have to do anything with him actually. He does whatever I ask him to without fussing. He was happy, for instance, to put on the party hat above while I snapped a few shots of himAnything to please me. He's really good that way. Such a wonderful dog

Wellll, it's too late now, Ache. Why didn't you post a little something about what time the two of you were heading out? Cheerio had gotten wind of it and was looking forward to a walk with her harness. Now, I'll have to find another time to take her so she won't be disappointed in all that grass to sniff, and birds to stalk - of course, I would stop her before she could reach them.

Posted by ambergirl[/QUOTE]Age has never been an issue for William. He likes his women young, old, and in-between...His only preference is for BIG. He equates size with sex appeal. It really turns him onHe doesnt like it when I call him a 'chubby chaser', but that is what you are, William, so get over yourself

Having no belief for this team makes sucess a wonderful surprise. Expectation for success seems more like a feeling of entitlement in the current situation.Posted by NUSoxFan[/QUOTE]I BELIEVE YOU.. the Angels (2-4) don't have a shot EITHER
