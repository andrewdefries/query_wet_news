Yep, the only decade we missed was the '90's.....of course we lost Bias and Lewis...and two of the big three retired prematurely....what might have been...we will never know....at least all of our titles were played under the modern rules...and there isn't a huge asterisk on one of our titles (see 2002 Sacramento series)....there has never been another NBA franchise like the Boston Celtics...but I will give the Laker fans their due....that franchise is a very close 2nd....

you know Red, I have been a Dodger fan for well over 50 years....I know what you mean about the 23 years they have now gone without winning another championship...and yet, as a die hard fan, I follow them religiously every year....right now I have the "Kershaw and Kemp" watch going.....Cy Young and possible MVP....as a fan, that's all I have left to keep me watching......as a Celtic fan, I had to endure the same thing albeit for different reasons....and I have never stopped watching....ditto as a lifelong Ram fan....and of course as a fan of our beloved Sox! True fans live for today but never forget about yesterday.....!

In Response to Re: Laker 8-peat:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: Laker 8-peat : You are crazy! Of course we would prefer the Celtics not making the playoffs instead of making it to the Finals and ending up the 1st loser! Why? Because we would have better position in the Draft! The reason why the Celtics got Ray and KG was because of Al Jefferson and the #5 pick of the 2007 Draft. If I tell you the Lakers would make it to the Finals but would lose, would you rather appear in the Finals or have a better pick in the Draft?Posted by Fiercest34[/QUOTE]Finals, of course. But knowing that the Celtics are fond of missing the playoffs, lottery picks are your view of season success. Guess that has been imprinted in your psyche...16 missing playoffs, 9 lottery picks. You should be proud...

In Response to Re: Laker 8-peat:[QUOTE]In Response to Re: Laker 8-peat : All this post really does is define the ceiling and floor of both franchises. At their best, both teams have won championships. A failure for the Lakers is still getting to the NBA finals, but losing. Failure for the Celtics is....disappearing into irrelevance for 22 years. In times of failure, I'll take relevant and interesting over irrelevant and anonymity.Posted by ItsNot1966anymor[/QUOTE]No, as Fierce said, the Celtics have a new definition of relevance: lottery picks.They would rather get a lottery pick than winning 3 rounds of the playoffs. Can't blame them for having a damaged psyche. 22 years are a looooooooong time...

I ask this every year but it's interesting to read the responses. I know this isn't an option nor will it probably ever be one, especially while BB is here. BUT...
If they offered a PPV to have full coverage of the Patriots war room during the NFL draft how much would you pay to watch? It would be very interesting to say the least, this years draft might not be as exciting to watch as previous drafts but still it would be fun.
So my question is how much would you pay to have full Patriots war room coverage during this years draft? How much to get all teams war room coverage?
This year I probably wouldn't pay more then $30 for the Pats war room coverage. Previous year I would have paid $50. For all teams War room coverage this year I would probably only go as high as $50. How about you? You have chosen to ignore posts from pcmIV.

Probably the same. Frankly the thing I would be most interested in would be to see how many deals that never happen get talked about in a given year.

You have one of the best QBs to play the game and with 42 seconds left you spike and knee the ball. Why did the Pats not run their offense and try to score--at least gain another 1st down, therefore decreasing the yardage on the FG try---I am confounded by this---is anyone else----42 yard FGs under pressure to win are not even close to guaranteed.

It's a very good question and when it happened I could believe what was seeing. Going soft, non the less for a fg over 35+ yards? Not the usual Patriots way, personally. But, this game was such a cluster you know what, I wasn't surprised by anything that happened in this game. It was like watching a greek tragedy unfold.

I agree and wondered that as well. I have tons of questions as well. Edelman started over Welker? We trade for Salas and give up two picks for him but he isnt good enough for the active roster. we had 3rd and short twice and try to throw for 30plus yards.....we back ourselves in a corner and now have to play the Ravens in Baltimore and 1-2 looks like a reality.............wow

You just saw Spikes take the ball away from the opposing team under similar conditions and you ask why, Ghost should have made the kick.

Move over Peddy, we have a new laser show.
How many more will Iggy hit by the end of Spring training? I say 5.

In response to Triumph-'s comment: and this counts for what when he goes to AAA? It will give a much needed boost of confidence for him.

Brown to crash at Thompson pad
E-mail|Link|Comments ()
February 12, 2010 06:35 PM
By Andrea Estes, Globe Staff
They already had a lot in common.
Scott Brown
They're both Republicans with service in the US Senate. Both advanced their careers by playing for the cameras. Both sought to cultivate a certain image by driving a pickup truck.
Now Scott Brown and former Tennessee senator and actor Fred Thompson have another thing in common: the same residence.
Massachusetts' newest senator is going to rent Thompson's six-room condo on Pennsylvania Avenue while Brown and his family look for a more permanent place to live.
Chez Fred, called the Residences at Market Square, is in a neighborhood of federal office buildings, including the National Archives and US Navy Memorial. It has an underground garage, though a Brown aide didn't know whether Brown will park his now-famous truck there.
Though the apartment isn't cheap -- it is assessed by the District of Columbia at more than $700,000 -- living there won't dent Brown's regular-guy image like if he had rented Thompson's other place: a massive brick mansion in Virginia worth millions.

The grounder went to second, with Jason Tyner easily thrown out at first. Derek Lowe's fist shot in the air. The no-hitter was complete. Though it didn't dim the moment, Lowe hadn't exactly no-hit the 1927 Yankees.Back in April 2002, Tampa Bay's lineup was a few hops from a Triple A crew. The lineup that day? Tyner, Randy Winn, Steve Cox, Toby Hall, Ben Grieve, Greg Vaughn, Brent Abernathy, Russ Johnson, and Felix Escalona. As Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein put it, a "pretty mediocre" group.Those Devil Rays were the joke of the American League. In the intervening seven years, the organization has changed its name, its leadership, and its standing in baseball circles, a transformation that culminated with a trip to the World Series last season.The Rays' victory in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series over the Red Sox put a new name at the top of the AL East. The Rays might be nouveau riche, but they can't be ignored."You know how we talk about trying to make our lineup longer, thicker?" Sox manager Terry Francona said. "Our division seems like it's getting like that. For the longest time before I got here, the Yankees had their way, and Boston was always kind of fighting them. And then we finally were fortunate enough to make a move. Now Tampa has made their move. It's hard. It's a tough division. No getting around [that]."No getting around the math, either. With perhaps the three best teams in baseball, there's a problem. At least one will not make the playoffs - that's a guarantee.When the 2008 Rays finally made good on the promise of their farm system, of the talent that blossomed in southwest Florida, they left the Yankees out of the postseason for the first time since 1995. The team with the largest payroll in baseball was left to pack its bags at the beginning of October instead of the end."I think we're biased," Toronto general manager J.P. Ricciardi said. "We see this division, we play in this division, and I think if you talk to Theo and [Brian] Cashman and Andrew [Friedman] and Andy [MacPhail], they'll tell you the same thing: It's just a monster division."It used to be easy, or at least easier. It was just the Yankees and Red Sox, the Red Sox and Yankees, for a decade."You could say there were two or three teams in our division that we should dominate, if we play well," Epstein said of the thought process when he came to the Sox in 2002. "That's a quick way to get yourself 20 games over .50
