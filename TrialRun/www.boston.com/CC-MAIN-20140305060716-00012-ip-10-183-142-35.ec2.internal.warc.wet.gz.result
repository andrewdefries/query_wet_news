First: Last: I think the Pats are really looking for a blocking TE. Something similar to what we saw last year with their 5th round pick (Lee Smith) and then again with the addition of Dan Gronk. I think Fells would fulfil a need (as explained by Laz). The addition of a 3rd TE would most likely spell the end of our FB Lousaka Polite.

I'm a fan of both and have assumed throughout this season that Ellsbury is leaving and Bradley will start in CF next year. That said, I think Bradley, who is a very good outfielder with a terrific arm, has yet to show he can hit MLB pitching. At the same age and with virtually identical opportunities, Ellsbury had already demonstrated that ability--see 2007. Ellsbury is much faster on the base paths and in the OF, is beginning to look an awful lot like a .300 or better hitter, leads the Sox in runs scored, is just behind Pedroia in total hits, and is third on the Sox in total bases. In short, right now the two are about even in fielding--maybe the edge goes to Bradley because of his arm--but Ellsbury has a huge edge on offense, which is why he replaced Coco Crisp in 2008. I still think Ellsbury is gone after this year, but am beginning to think he will leave a hole in the offense. You have chosen to ignore posts from slasher9.

ellsbury has certainly turned his season around. although his power numbers are no where to be found...he is acting the quintessential leadoff hitter. which is what he is. satan boras will sell him to the highest bidder and his price tag is increasing with every knock. after a hot spring training, you are dead on....bradley has shown nothing in his AB's to prove he can handle big league pitching. i would like to believe he can and will as i believe ells will be playing elsewhere next year.

Bradley will not be the same offensive player that Jacoby was. If people are expecting a kid who will batting titles and hit HR's then they will be very dissapointed in what JBJ brings. What Bradely is, is a truly elite defensive player at a position that is highly defensive minded. he likely hit at a decent clip, I see him being a .270-.280 guy who may have some .300 seasons in his prime. With that AVG I still think his ceiling is a leadoff hitter because he may be that guy who walks a TON. So his offense will be above average, but barely above average. Seeing how the typical fan thinks that for a player to be a good batter they have to hit .300 and knock out 30 I think a lot will be dissapointed in his career. I think JBJ will also be that guy that brings a lot of intangibles to the table; he will have those 15 pitch at bats that wear down a pitcher, he will be the guy who hussles to get to 3B from 1B and do all those other little things that the box score scouts can't appreciate. Personally.......I like the kinda player JBJ will likely be; but I'm fully aware that some here will truly underappreciate him. You have chosen to ignore posts from seannybboi.

Scouts see him as 10-15 HR guy.
