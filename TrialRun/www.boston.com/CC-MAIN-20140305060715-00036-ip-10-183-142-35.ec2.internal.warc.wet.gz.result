Leafs are lucky they dressed both their goons. They have been a real help for them tonight.

In response to mia76's comment: In response to TFB12's comment: In response to mia76's comment: I am not aware of any #2 QB getting meaningful snaps for any good team unless the #1 QB is injured. Flynn got his start against the Pats because Rogers had concusion concerns. Cassel got his snaps because Brady was out for the year. Same for all the #2 QBs in Philly - helps having an injury prone starter! So those hoping to see Mallett get some meaningful minutes are really hoping Brady gets hurt! Well you certainly have a very good point here. But I think the question here is could Mallet have gone in at then end of games and got some time in? rkarp posted some games that clearly shows he could have. When Rodgers was backing up Favre he was put in a few games, not many only 7 games in 3 years backing him up, but in those 3 years he threw the ball a total of 59 times. Much more then Mallets 4. I don't think most scouts really count end of blow-out game stats seriously. Not only does the offensive philosphy change significantly, but typically it is not just the QB that gets pulled, but a few other starters. For a back-up QB his typical 3 downs are: 1 - hand off, 2 - hand off, 3 - pass and with the other team knowing this, the third down pass is typically 3rd and long which is not an ideal passing situation. And the coach has told him on 1st and 2nd down, even if all 11 defenders are in the box, do not call an audible. Add to that the fact the QB has been sitting around for a few hours since warm-up and the offensive game plan has nothing to do with his strengths. The only real playing time most #2s get are in preseason and when the #1 goes down or gets yanked in a competitive game. Yes they do. They can see arm strength, various throws, reading the defense.....everything that Mallett has never shown in a game. You have chosen to ignore posts from rkarp.

In response to wozzy's comment: Let's see if Oakland will bite on Mallett for Palmer and a #1 straight up? Sounds like Oakland went with Flynn. Leaves Buff, Jets, Cards, maybe Jacks looking for QB. You have chosen to ignore posts from wozzy.

Lets face it people, its our system that makes things run not Brady, come on he was drafted in the 6th round with barley any talent and he thrived but so did a nobody like matt casell so why don't we trade Brady while we can get a huge return and sign Peyton to finish out his time i know you will say no way but can you see Peyton throwing in our system he would smash all kind of records
