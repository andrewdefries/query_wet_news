That's cute. He lied and people died, especially cute considering the GOP plan was nonexistent. Couple of facts The plan that is being wound down was always a temp solution until ACA can be fully implemented. People with pre existing conditions will not be turned away by insurance companies under the fully implemented law because it will be illegal to do so The people currently on the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan will retain their current temp coverage until Jan 1 2014 This post has been removed.

With all due respect for him and what he has done over the years (and he's one of very few Yankees I admire, and happen to like), I think we just saw what happens when the 2011 Mariano pitches with all eyes on the umpire's calls. The first game calls were so outrageous (Lowrie really got scr****), that, I believe, the umpire in this game couldn't give Rivera all the outside pitches he usually gets as called strikes simply because he's "Mariano Rivera". Instead he walks batters, one on four pitches, and gives up hits when he has to throw in the strike zone. No one is ever going to change my mind on that since I've been saying it since last season, and just said it recently again. Whenever he needs a strike, he just throws outside and gets the call.While I do admire him, he happens to play against my team on their #1 rival's team. It does matter to the Sox, and their fans, whether you like him or not, that he still gets calls that aren't even close to the plate -- or at least it should.No one has said anything about it, and no one ever does. They are in such awe of him, that no one can say anything negative about the great Mariano. Well, guess what? Mariano doesn't pitch for your team, and comes in a closer role to shut your team down. If RSN can't get past the awe, and the belief that no one can ever say anthing about him, that's who you may face determining your team's season. If it were me, and this was really my team that I owned, I would file a complaint until it stopped. At least make someone aware that you are aware, and shine a light on it instead of all the silence about it.
