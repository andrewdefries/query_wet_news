About this project
What happens to the ribbon of land being created by the depression of the Central Artery may be the most important development decision to face Boston in a generation.
Panel Recommendations
A national panel of experts in governance, landscape architecture, and design offers recommendations on designing, building, and operating the Rose Kennedy Greenway. | Go | Residents dream big
A pair of public forums dubbed "Community Conversations" resulted in dozens of innovative ideas for the Rose Kennedy Greenway. Check out stories, photos, and the ideas themselves. | Go |
About the land
The Central Artery land weaves nearly continuously from Chinatown to North Station, but its two dozen individual parcels differ considerably in character and potential use. Here's a look. | Go |
Lessons from the world
Boston is unique, but the issues involved in reclaiming Central Artery land are not. A series of MIT case studies looks at lessons from similar projects around the world. | Go |

Friendly's is using trans fat-free oils

Friendly Ice Cream Corp., a Wilbraham-based chain of about 500 restaurants, said it is "officially banning artificial trans fat" from its menu.
Earlier this year, Friendly's disclosed plans to join other restaurant chains in phasing out trans fat oil and said then that it expected the transition to be completed by the fall. (The image at right was taken from Friendly's website.)
Friendly's announcement in March came roughly at the same time as Boston's health board was giving final approval to a ban on trans fat. Other communities, including Brookline and Tiburon, Calif., have taken similar actions. Trans fat has been linked to heart disease in humans.
Friendly's said it will now be using "a high mono-unsaturated canola oil product, which can actually help lower blood cholesterol."
"We want to continue to try to provide our customers with their favorite foods but in a healthier way," Andre Fuehr, a Friendly's vice president, said in a statement. "We are excited to join others in the restaurant industry who have taken this same step and encourage others to do the same. This small step can have measurable effects on one's health."

The Thing was the scariest freakin thing I ever watched. I wouldn't let my dog near me for weeks. Overall though, not a fan of the genre.
