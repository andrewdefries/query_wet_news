Secrets of ‘miraculous’ charter management organizations
By Valerie Strauss
This was written by Lance Hill, executive director of the Southern Institute for Education and Research in New Orleans and a member of the New Orleans Education Equity Roundtable . In this post Hill writes about the final report from The National Study of CMO Effectiveness, a four-year effort aimed at assessing the impact of charter management organizations on student achievement and identifying practices and structure that are effective at raising achievement. The study was done by researchers from Mathematica Policy Research and the Center on Reinventing Public Education.
By Lance Hill
Miracles are by definition impossible to explain, so it is not surprising that a study of the secrets of the most miraculous charter management organization (CMOs) results in a few ethereal observations. The report discovered that successful CMOs emphasize high expectations, strict behavioral management, and teacher coaching. Methodology aside, this is not exactly the discovery of the Holy Grail of education.
The mantra of high expectations has been around for a long time and is the central pedagogy of Teach for America. That it exists is not doubted; that it works better than other methods has never been proven. Given the high attrition rates of putatively successful charters, one might conclude that high expectations also results in high frustration. But the method of high expectations is not unique to charters: it was pioneered by private schools for decades and often inculcated with a whack of the ruler.
The report then turns to the miraculous behavior management techniques of charters. Again, the rigid control of even the smallest behaviors is not a charter school innovation: San Quentin had the “silent rule” for prisoners several decades ago and it worked just fine.
Here the report lets the cat out of the bag: one of the keys to effective CMO behavior management is bribing students to behave. The report notes that “paycheck” of merit/demerit systems are the “backbones of culture-building efforts.” At KIPP schools, one of the CMOs honored as “successful,” students are, on average, paid $40-$50 a week to incentivize compliant behavior. Again, no groundbreaking insight here: for decades this reward/punishment method has been used by parents in the form of a far more modest “allowance” which depended on complying with parent rules. Since the policy is not financially replicable if charters are brought to scale, then why is it cited as a model to be emulated? But the most wafer-thin finding of the report is that successful CMOs engage in more coaching of teachers. First, frequent coaching of teachers can be a sign that charter teachers are poorly prepared for the profession. I know of one KIPP school that was largely staffed by novice Teach for America teachers and so had one vice principal for every 10 teachers who needed constant on-the-job training. But assuming that extensive coaching is necessary for a skilled teaching staff, do these CMOs coach more frequently and more effectively than other schools? Page seven of the report graphs the differences in teacher observation and coaching time at successful CMOs, average CMOs, and public schools. One might expect significant differences between the miracle charters and the much maligned public schools. Instead, the CMOs are graphed at about seven observation-feedbacks a year while public schools are graphed at bout five. Not much difference there. There are some other methodology questions with the study. While the study details the observation and feedback policies of the CMOs, it does not report whether or not these polices are actually practiced. There is no detailed data on the public schools reviewed and some of the “exemplary” CMO policies include the requirement that teachers submit a weekly lesson plan weekly — the norm at many public schools. Principal’s “feedback” events are defined as a principal observing a few minutes and then telling a teacher “good job.” Interestingly, the study reports that in some areas, as much as 40% of the not-so-successful CMOs don’t engage in these “best practices.” By singling out what the authors regard as the most effective CMOs, we learn than nearly half the CMOs are not on the success trajectory. If these are model “strategies for student behavior and teacher coaching,” one has to ask: where’s the evidence? What passes as “evidence-based science” in the report is the relatively higher-achieving CMOs are selected and then the study makes the enormous leap of faith that these CMOs’ practices must be effective. In Logic, this is identified as the classic causality fallacy, post hoc ergo propter hoc: “after this, therefore because of this.” There is no proof that a specific intervention causes a specific outcome. But then again, miracles are defined as “an event that is contrary to the established laws of nature and attributed to a supernatural cause.” The word derives from the Latin word mīrārī which means “to wonder at.” By definition, there’s no science behind miracles and all we can do is behold them in wonder but never explain them. -0-

Who’s getting your vote? Tell us which man you’re casting your ballot for, and why.
By Delece Smith-Barrow
(The Washington Post)
Sometimes an “I voted” sticker isn’t enough when you want to bask in our country’s patriotic spirit. The Washington Post has created an interactive graphic that lets readers design a button saying who they voted for and why. Depending on your party preference, the button comes in blue and white or red and white; readers get 30 characters to say why they are #teamRomney or #teamObama.
Click here to create your button using our “I voted because...” tool, and let us know why voting is important to you.
Bonus: Check in on foursquare with an #ivoted hash tag, and get a limited edition “I Voted” badge. More from The Root DC

How to avoid shopping fraud on Cyber Monday
View Photo Gallery — Black Friday madness on Thanksgiving Day: This year holiday sales began a little earlier as shoppers flocked to big-box stores for door-busting deals on Thanksgiving. More deals are expected on Cyber Monday. By Meghan Kelly | VentureBeat.com, There once was a time when the biggest shopping scams were overpriced department stores and fake purses. But now shoppers should be on alert for Cyber Monday, which creates a whole new arena for ripping you off.
“All signs point to 2012 being the biggest year yet for scammers,” said Mark Risher, the chief executive of business security provider Imperva, in an email to VentureBeat. “In the week leading up to Cyber Monday, we’ve already seen a five-time increase in the amount of shopping-related spam across social networks.”

Black Friday 2012
From game plans to apps and tips on how to shop smart, here is the Post’s guide to the holiday season’s unofficial kickoff.
Cyber Monday is a term the National Retail Federation created in 2005 to call attention to all the online shopping you’ll probably be doing on the Monday after Thanksgiving, when you’re back at work and failing to be productive. Over time, it’s turned into a semi-big deal, with lots of discounts, coupons, and other bargains.Cyber criminals go where the money is and where the easiest targets are, and Cyber Monday brings both of these together. People are on the hunt for good deals, and they are prepared to spend their dollars. It’s an ideal opportunity for a criminal to slip in and get you to click on a fake deal — the Internet equivalent to “Psst, hey, there are some Louis Vuitton bags down that alleyway.”Indeed, social media is going to be hit hard with fake deals and likely even viruses that spread messages heralding savings. Criminals like to target social media because you inherently trust posts from your friends. If they can post a status to your friend’s Facebook wall on your behalf, he’s likely to believe it’s you that posted the status update, and click the link.Pinterest users should also watch out. We saw a rash of Pinterest scams in March in which clicking a picture on its network leads to a spammy website. Since then, Pinterest is doing better at blocking these websites. It also tells you if you are being redirected to a different site when you click on a pin. Still, click with care.Shoppers should be wary of public Wi-Fi hotspots. With smartphones today, a lot of people shop in malls, doing comparison shopping. According to a study by security company McAfee, 73 percent of Americans feel comfortable using public Wi-Fi, and 54 percent of Americans plan on using their phones to shop this holiday season. But you never know who is snooping the traffic on that hotspot that advertises itself as “free public Wi-Fi,” collecting all the data you’re transmitting.Be sure to only make payments over a secure Internet connection to avoid getting your information — and maybe even identity — stolen.According to Risher, the concerns about mobile shopping don’t end there.“Mobile devices present an extra problem, because the small screens make it difficult for users to see where a link is leading” unlike on a desktop browser, where users can hover over the link to see its true destination, Risher said. “In these circumstances, users should be extremely cautious about entering their username or password on any pages they reach through a click. When in doubt, always browse to the site directly or use a bookmark to ensure against phishing and fraud.”Bitdefender, a Romanian anti-virus company, says shoppers should look out for any offers of a “Platinum Card for Cyber Monday” advertisements. These are fake and infect the computer with malware when clicked.If you do fall for one of these scams, Risher says to pay close attention to your credit card statements for any unusual activity.“In addition, customers should ensure their anti-virus software is up-to-date and running regularly, as many shady sites can also harbor viruses and malware,” Bitdefender advises.
