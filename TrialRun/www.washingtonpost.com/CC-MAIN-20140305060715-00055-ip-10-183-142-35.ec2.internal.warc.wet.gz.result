After illness, Landon Donovan says he expects to play in CONCACAF Gold Cup opener against Canada
By Steven Goff
Landon Donovan, who missed the U.S. national team’s friendly against Spain on Saturday because of illness, practiced Sunday and expects to play in the CONCACAF Gold Cup opener against Canada on Tuesday at Ford Field in Detroit.
After an hour-long session at the Detroit Lions’ training facility, Donovan said: “I haven’t properly trained in a few days so today was a little more difficult than a normal training session. I was breathing pretty hard, but I feel good and I would expect to be fine by Tuesday.”
Coach Bob Bradley expressed no concern about Donovan’s recovery, saying: “He was into it today. We let him be the neutral player [during a scrimmage] just because he’s coming off of a day where he doesn’t feel good. He was involved and I know he’s excited to get going.”
For much more.....
Donovan began to feel sick Friday and the ailment carried over to gameday. He stayed behind at the team hotel, across the parking lot from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass., and watched the 4-0 loss on TV.
“All things considered, it didn’t make any sense to put my body through a very hard exercise like that,” he said of the Spain match. “It’s one thing if you’re just going to sit in an office all day, but to go through that, I didn’t want to prolong it anymore. Now, having gotten through it, it was absolutely the right decision.”
From his hotel room, “Out my window, I could see people lining up outside the stadium. It was painful to be there and not be able to play.”
With Donovan expected to return, veterans Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley pegged to start after playing just a half and Carlos Bocanegra set to play after sitting out Saturday, the U.S. team will present a much stronger lineup than the one that was overwhelmed by the Spanish.
At the start of Sunday’s practice, Bocanegra and Steve Cherundolo were on the corners of the backline and Oguchi Onyewu and Clarence Goodson in the middle. Jermaine Jones and Michael Bradley partnered in central midfield with Freddy Adu and Alejandro Bedoya on the wings. However, the pairings changed as the session progressed. Adu struck two fine goals, but it remains unclear whether he’ll crack the the game-day roster after not being chosen Saturday.
Bedoya will officially be added to the Gold Cup roster soon, replacing Benny Feilhaber (ankle injury).
After playing on a temporary grass surface in Foxborough, Dempsey said he wasn’t thrilled to have to do the same in Detroit.
“If it’s going to help the game of soccer [by making it possible to play in big stadiums], that’s great, but as far as how I really feel, I don’t like it,” he said. “The ball doesn’t bounce right; it kills it. You are worried about slipping when you catch yourself in a seam. Those are things you shouldn’t have to worry about when you are out there running and worrying about your knee going.”
Bob Bradley echoed Dempsey’s opinion.
“You can see the ball doesn’t bounce. We still have a situation in this country when the national team plays the biggest countries, for our fans it’s important to play in the big stadiums, and yet many of these big stadiums don’t have natural grass as their natural surface. We understand the reason we play in those stadiums, but players and coaches, we all like to play when the field is perfect.”

Occupy D.C. protesters are ready to defend ‘home’ — should they?
By Katie Rogers
Ken Srdjak, 25, of Washington, has been living in McPherson Square as part of Occupy D.C. on and off since November 2011.
(Jacquelyn Martin - AP)
The National Park Service will begin enforcing no-camping rules at both Occupy D.C. sites Monday, according to The Post’s Annie Gowen. It’s not quite an eviction — but protesters can’t sleep in either park or keep camping materials with them. Oft-quoted protester Sam Jewler told Gowen that he and other occupiers will risk arrest to preserve the encampments. “Many of us will be likely to defend the park with the passion anyone would show defending their home,” Jewler said. “We are fighting for the betterment of D.C., America and the world, and we intend to continue using our First Amendment rights to do so.”
Other occupiers took to Twitter Friday afternoon to air their grievances, post photos of the Park Service warnings placed on encampment tents and even crack a joke or two: We should tell #ParkPo to come back another day because we're not finished training the rats. #OccupyDCFri Jan 27 19:31:45 via webArchangeLRKNJL View more reactions after the jump: Tell us: Do you think Occupy D.C. protesters are within their rights to keep camping? ]View the story "Occupy D.C. protesters: Why can't we keep on camping?" on Storify]

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional

Bradley Manning declines to enter plea at court martial
By Julie Tate, E-mail the writer
Bradley Manning, the Army private accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of documents to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, declined to enter a plea at the start of his court martial on Thursday, a legal maneuver intended to give his defense more time to hear what evidence or witnesses will be permitted during the proceedings.
During a brief arraignment at Fort Meade, Manning, in his green Army dress uniform, answered questions concerning his counsel and the charges against him. But he deferred a choice of whether to be tried by a military jury or a judge. Earlier this month, an Army general ordered a court martial for the 24-year-old Manning after a preliminary hearing in which the prosecution presented evidence that he had allegedly leaked hundreds of thousands of State Department cables, daily field reports from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and other classified material to WikiLeaks.He faces 22 charges, ranging from the use of unauthorized software on a classified computer to aiding the enemy. If convicted of all charges, Manning could be sentenced to life in prison. In March, the military judge in the case, Col. Denise R. Lind, is scheduled to hear arguments about motions concerning discovery, the deposition of witnesses, and a clarification of charges against Manning, among other motions.Manning’s defense attorney, David E. Coombs, sought Thursday to set a trial date for the court martial in June, arguing that his client has spent 635 days in pretrial detention. The prosecution said that although it would be ready for trial by April, a reasonable trial calendar would have the proceedings begin Aug. 3. Lind did not set a trial date.
