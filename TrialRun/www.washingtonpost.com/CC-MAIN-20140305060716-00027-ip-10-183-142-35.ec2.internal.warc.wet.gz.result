John Boehner: President Obama picking ‘fake fights’
By Ed O'Keefe
House Speaker John A. Boehner once again called out President Obama on Sunday, accusing him of turning relatively uncontroversial subjects into political fights. Reiterating an argument he made last week as the president pressed Congress to quickly extend low subsidized college student loan rates for another year, Boehner said: “The president is getting some very bad advice from his campaign team, because he’s diminishing the presidency by picking fake fights, going after straw men every day.”
Boehner (R-Ohio) spoke in an interview broadcast Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
Boehner told CNN’s Candy Crowley that he and the president have a good relationship, but he then attacked Obama for his recent speeches attacking the GOP’s position on student loans.
“The point I’ve been trying to make here in the last couple of weeks is that the president’s bigger than this,” Boehner said. He cast his criticism as constructive: “Somebody needs to help him out, so I thought I would.”
In the interview, Boehner said that Congress will find a way to prevent the loan rates from climbing when they expire in July. “Democrats and Republicans, for months, have been working together, trying to figure out a way to resolve the problem.”
For more on what Boehner said, read this Post story.

Rep. Allen West considers leaving Congressional Black Caucus after Carson remarks
By Felicia Sonmez
Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com
This story has been updated.
The sole Republican member of the Congressional Black Caucus says he is considering leaving the group after reports of inflammatory remarks made by another member, Rep. Andre Carson (D-Ind.), about the tea party movement.
Rep. Allen West, a freshman Republican from Florida, said on “Fox and Friends” Wednesday morning that the comments by Carson – who charged at a town hall last week that tea-party supporters would like to see African Americans “hanging from a tree” – had caused him to think twice about belonging to the 43-member group.
“Well, I think that we heard the president talk about some of this over-the-top rhetoric, and we should move away from that,” West said. “But when you start using words such as ‘lynching’ … that’s a very reprehensible word, and I think we should move away from that language.”
“And I have to tell you, one of the things I’m starting to think about is reconsidering my membership in the Congressional Black Caucus, because I don’t think that they’re moving toward the right manner in which we’re going to solve the problems not just in the black community, but all across the United States of America,” he added.
Later Wednesday, West sent a letter to CBC Chairman Emanuel Cleaver calling on the Missouri Democrat “to both condemn these types of hate-filled comments, and to disassociate the Congressional Black Caucus from these types of remarks. Otherwise, I will have to seriously reconsider my membership within the organization.” A national tea party group issued a statement Wednesday evening calling on Carson to resign.
“Rep. Carson should immediately resign from Congress,” said Martin Meckler and Jenny Beth Martin of the Tea Party Patriots. “He is clearly not fit to serve. This type of disgusting, hateful rhetoric has no place in our political discourse. At a minimum, he should be removed from leadership in the Congressional Black Caucus, and censured by his colleagues. If they refuse to take these actions, they are sending a clear statement to the American public that it is acceptable for ‘leaders’ in Congress to wantonly accuse their fellow members and the American public of desiring murder.”
West himself has drawn headlines for using incendiary language as recently as last month, when he sent a message to Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz calling the Florida Democrat “vile” and “despicable” and stating that she should “shut the heck up.” West defended the message, which he also copied to congressional leadership.
And in an appearance on “The O’Reilly Factor” two weeks ago, West invoked slavery-era imagery, likening himself to “a modern-day Harriet Tubman” and calling the Democratic Party “a 21st Century plantation.”
West in January became the first Republican in 14 years to join the CBC. The group’s last Republican member, former Rep. Gary Franks (Conn.), left Congress in 1997. Rep. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who with West is one of two black Republicans in the House, declined to join the group, saying in a statement last year that “while I recognize the efforts of the CBC and appreciate their invitation for me to caucus with them, I will not be joining at this time. My campaign was never about race.”

‘Entertainment Tonight’ turns 30: A look back at the big stories (and big shoulder pads)
By Jen Chaney
Back in the entertainment news days of yore — a time before pop culture blogs and Twitter accounts that allowed celebrities to disseminate information themselves — a person’s best hope for staying on top of breaking Hollywood news was “Entertainment Tonight.”
The half-hour program that introduced the world to the perpetually perky Mary Hart turns 30 today. It arrived on our airwaves Sept. 14, 1981, with its jaunty theme song, no Hart (she would bring that UV-ray-emitting smile to the team later, in 1982) and the promise to introduce us to “some very interesting people,” including Burt Reynolds, Brooke Shields, Walter Matthau and Kenny Rogers. The lead story: Richard Chamberlain not winning an Emmy for his role in the miniseries “Shogun.” Clearly the show evolved over the years, expanding its definition of celebrity and, like many media outlets that cover entertainment, growing a bit more salacious with the times. Here are some video highlights from three decades of “Entertainment Tonight.”
The weekend edition of ‘Entertainment Tonight” from Easter weekend, 1982. Breaking news: People like video games! Hal Linden talks life after prime time! Also, Robin Leach interviews Lainie Kazan about judging a Marilyn Monroe look-alike contest with high-larious results.
Oct. 18, 1985, when the big stories were the cancellation of “The Fall Guy,” the release of the anti-apartheid single “Sun City” and Rae Dawn Chong’s role in “Commando.”
Here’s a 1987 “Entertainment Tonight” promo featuring the one . . . the only . . . John Tesh. If you watch “ET,” “you won’t miss a beat,” promises Tesh co-host Hart in this teaser. Apparently you also won’t miss Mary Hart’s shoulder pads, since they are visible from distant galaxies.
Even Hart’s mega-ponytail can’t distract from the seriousness of this 1991 “ET” episode, in which the news magazine covered the Persian Gulf War.
The “ET” summer movie preview 1997, featuring blockbusters such as “Men in Black,” “Con-Air,” “Air Force One” and, of course, Brendan Fraser in “George of the Jungle.” “I guess if I was going to be embarrassed, I’m in the wrong business,” Fraser says. That statement also sums up the thought process that, more than a decade later, would lead Fraser to star in “Furry Vengeance.”
The Aug. 24, 2001, episode, which leads with Gary Condit’s interview with Connie Chung regarding the Chandra Levy case and a body language analysis of Condit and wife Carolyn. Hey, who said “ET” never did investigative, political journalism?
And lastly, the farewell to “Entertainment Tonight” goddess Mary Hart, which aired this year. Oh, there were tears. Thankfully, no shoulder pads, though.

Shark fin soup made with imperiled species, new analysis finds
View Photo Gallery — The true fear factor: Shark extinction: The growing demand for shark's fin soup, coupled with accidental catch by fishing vessels targeting tuna and swordfish, kills tens of millions of sharks each year. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, roughly one-third of all shark species face some threat of extinction. By Juliet Eilperin, E-mail the writer
Consumers of shark fin soup — a delicacy served in Washington and major cities around the country — may be unwittingly consuming animals threatened with extinction, according to a analysis released Thursday.
A team of scientists from Stony Brook University and Chicago’s Field Museum, working in conjunction with the Pew Environment Group, found that some of the soup purchased in 14 major U.S. cities featured fins from imperiled species — including scalloped hammerheads, smooth hammerheads, school sharks and spiny dogfish.

All four species face some threat of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.“The soup test is significant because it shows the United States is also contributing to the global decline of sharks. And Americans who eat the shark’s fin soup may be consuming an endangered species without even knowing it,” Liz Karan, manager of global shark conservation at the Pew Environment Group, said in a telephone call with reporters. “This is bad for sharks, but also bad for the ocean environment.”
About one-third of all shark species are vulnerable to extinction, according to the IUCN, because they are targeted for their fins and because they are caught accidentally by vessels fishing for species such as tuna and swordfish.Researchers found fins from blue shark, which reproduces more quickly than other species and is not imperiled, in one of four bowls of soup purchased in the Washington area. They could not identify the shark species in the other three bowls.The group declined to say where it had bought the soup. At least two Maryland establishments, Rockville’s Tysons Buffet & Restaurant and Silver Spring’s Wong Gee Asian Restaurant, sell shark fin soup. According to the Animal Welfare Institute, at least nine restaurants in the region have offered it in recent years.“We are not trying to attack the people serving the soup. They are not doing anything illegal,” Pew spokeswoman Rachel Brittin wrote in an e-mail. “It’s up to state government to ban the possession, sale and trade of shark fin.”Five U.S. states — California, Hawaii, Illinois, Oregon and Washington — have banned the sale, trade and possession of shark fins. A similar measure in Maryland passed the state Senate this year but failed to make it through the House.Once a shark is caught and finned, the dried fins generally are sent to Hong Kong, the global center of the world’s fin trade, and then exported. Demian Chapman, who co-led the genetic testing at the Institute for Ocean Conservation Science at Stony Brook University, said he was initially skeptical of whether they would be able to extract DNA from the “fin rays,” which have been dried and chemically processed.“With that sort of assault, the DNA that’s left in the fin becomes very damaged,” Chapman said. But Chapman and his colleagues were able to identify 32 shark DNA samples, at which point researchers at the Field Museum’s Pritzker Laboratory compared the sequences to ones contained in the NIH genetic database GenBank.In addition to buying soup in Washington, the group purchased it in Albuquerque, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.Chapman said that though the United States effectively regulates shark fishing in its own waters, “Every nation gets poor marks for [inadequately] monitoring this trade, which is a global threat.”
