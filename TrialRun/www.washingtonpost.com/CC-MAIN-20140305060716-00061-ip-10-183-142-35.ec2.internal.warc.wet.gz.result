Washington Redskins’ Stephen Bowen expects to bounce back from knee scope
By Mike Jones
As the Washington Redskins kicked off OTAs on Monday, starting right defensive end Stephen Bowen worked on the side with trainers as he continued his rehabilitation from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. But Bowen expects to be healed within a month and aims to build on a career year that saw him record 41 tackles and six sacks in his first season with the Redskins.
“It was just a clean-out on my knee,” said Bowen, who had the surgery in mid-April. “I had some loose cartilage. I’ve been rehabbing the last month, just taking my time with it, making sure I’m 100 percent.”
Bowen suffered a third-degree PCL tear in the same knee in Week 12 of the 2011 season but didn’t need surgery and didn’t miss any playing time. He suspects that the cartilage damage may have had something to do with that injury. Bowen said he decided to have his knee scoped after experiencing some pain in his knee.
“It was a little annoying pain, and I didn’t want to deal with it in the season, so tried to get it taken care of so I’m 100 percent,” Bowen said. “I’ll probably be 100 percent the next two or three weeks.”
Although confident that he made the right decision in having the procedure done, Bowen said it’s hard watching his teammates, even in offseason practices.
“You’re out there and you see the D-line, and we’re a close-knit unit and I’m not out there battling with them, so it’s hard just to watch from the sideline,” said Bowen, who led all Redskins defensive linemen in sacks and ranked third overall on the team. “But I’ll be back out there soon enough battling with the guys and trying to cause some problems for peoples’ offenses. … [I’m] more comfortable in the scheme, know how other players play, and how to play off them. So I’m excited to be in it for another year.”

Brag a little ...
Jose: I have a positive look at life, love kids, and I do enjoy dancing salsa and merengue dancing. Amanda: Fun, not materialistic, very outgoing, interested in helping my partner have a good time and grow to be his best person. I am also good at balancing my life. So while I work full time and am in school part time, all of my friends say I do the most of any person they know: volunteer in my community, serve on student government and throw great barbecues. Your type ...
Jose: Brunette or blonde small/petite girl who does not take life too seriously and has a great smile.
Amanda: Physically: Thinner to cut, but not huge. A little hipster, or trendy. Emotionally: Talk about feelings and aspirations. Goals: They should be somewhat altruistic or based on a sense of calling. Your idea of funny ...
Jose: I find most Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler movies funny. Basically, non-sophisticated funny.
Amanda: Laugh at themselves. Do silly things in public, like play tag.
Interests to share ...
Jose: Likes to go out and see movies, loves to dance, enjoys being around kids, can be a kid at heart, likes sports and is close to her family.
Amanda: Biking, yoga, economic justice, optimism, travel to Latin America.
About the date ...
7:30 p.m., Eventide, Clarendon
Amanda:
I got the name of where we were eating, and I was like [unenthusiastically], “Oh, okay cool.” I’m not really a Clarendon person. I saw the guy’s name was Jose, and I was like, “Yeah, he’s Latino!” I like Spanish, and I like Latino culture a lot. I was biking up the street from where I work and got [to the restaurant] just two minutes late.
Jose:The hostess came over and told me Amanda was here. When we first met, she said, “Hola” in Spanish, and I said, “Hi, how are you?” I’ll admit, she wouldn’t be the girl who would catch my eye. Amanda:He was, you know, well-dressed, but ... I was like, [lukewarm] Yeah, maybe. He’s not [physically my type], but it would have been surmountable if our personalities had got along.
Jose: I think I was caught off guard when she spoke to me in Spanish. She was like, “Oh, I just came back [from Central America], so I’m still stuck on speaking Spanish.” Throughout the night she’d speak Spanish here and there, and I’d answer back in Spanish, but I normally talk in English to my friends and everyone. Where I teach is actually a Spanish immersion school, so I told her a little bit about that. She actually taught some English when she was traveling.
Amanda:It’s awesome that [he’s] into teaching.He’s dedicated to it. I couldn’t handle it; it’s a very tough job.He seems to be really motivated by working with kids and having his kids at school be successful. His goals and stuff are pretty cool; [Date Lab] didn’t match me up with someone who’s all about money or power, so they did a good job with that.
Jose:She loves to travel, and I have been traveling recently. But when I heard about hers, I was like, Whoa, she’s been all over the place. When I travel, basically it’s major cities and stuff, but she definitely goes outside the grid and has a ton of stories to share about it. Amanda: It turned out he did most of his traveling alone, which I thought was cool. If a person doesn’t like to travel, I’m probably not going to be interested in their lifestyle. We looked at the menus. I got some duck; he got some fish. We ended up sharing a little bit of our plates; that worked out pretty well. We had salads and dessert. Jose: Getting to know her, personality-wise, she’s outside of my norm. Growing up with my siblings, our thing was always going to the movies or watching TV together. So sometimes my humor is related to TV or movie stuff. I asked her, “What movies have you watched?” Amanda: I’m like, “Uhh, sometimes I watch movies on a plane?” I don’t really watch TV. If that’s something he likes to connect with people on, that’s a missed connection with me. Jose:She was like, “I like to do active stuff and go hiking.” I’m not really an outdoorsy guy. [And] I’ve come to realize that my friends are all people who like to go out Saturday nights, clubs in Clarendon or Dupont. She does go dancing, but she doesn’t go out as much as I do.
Amanda: I guess [I don’t go out] as much as I used to. Maybe I’m tired or going out of town, or going to a house party instead. When I do go out, it’s more Adams Morgan or Dupont Circle. ... You’re not gonna catch me over the bridge [in Arlington] when I go out; no, I’m not interested. Jose: I don’t know how this conversation came up, but we started talking about [the viral music video] “Gangnam Style” by Psy. I’ve only seen the video once, but apparently she’s seen it a bunch of times. Amanda: I can’t even really remember what we talked about. It wasn’t very memorable for me. It didn’t strike a chord.We talked about, like, smartphones; it was so stupid — what I mean by that is that it’s the sort of conversation you have on a first date. I didn’t really want to flirt with him. I was more inclined to make jokes and just try and talk and hear some stories about him. Jose: We left; it was 9:30-ish. I said, “Let’s go to Spider Kelly’s.” We played pool [and] skeeball. It felt more relaxed there. And then, coincidentally enough, the “Gangnam Style” song came on, so we started dancing to that.
Amanda: The song came on, and I was like, “We have to do it.” [We left] around 11. We got each other’s numbers, and he told me to text him when I got home. So that was nice. People always want you to text when you’re riding a bike ’cause they think you’re gonna die. Jose:Before 12 o’clock, I hadn’t heard from her, so I texted. She texted me back immediately and said: “Oh, I’m so sorry, I forgot. I’m actually at the office finishing up some French homework.”
Amanda:I would give [the date] a 4 [out of 5.] Dating is for romantic purposes where you wanna spend a lot of time with somebody and see that person as opposed to other people in a romantic sort of way. So, no, I probably wouldn’t [go on a second date]. But that doesn’t mean I didn’t have fun. He was a good date. There were awkward moments, but I wouldn’t say it was awkward overall.
Jose: The date itself I would rate as a 4. It was fun; I had a great time. Romantically, though, it was a 3. She was trying to be fun and have a good time. I just didn’t have attraction to her.
UPDATE: Any contact or plans since the date? “Nope and nope,” Amanda says. Adds Jose: “It was a fun date, but we did not have as many things in common [as] I wanted.”
“I know JUST the guy ...”

View Photo Gallery — The 66th Annual Tony Awards: Highlights from the 2012 Tony Awards. By Peter Marks, E-mail the writer
NEW YORK — The Kennedy Center fell just short of achieving Tony glory Sunday night as its acclaimed production of “Follies,” considered by some the best musical revival of the Broadway season, lost in the category to a revised version of George and Ira Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess.”
Still, in its third incarnation on Broadway, the 1970 musical by Stephen Sondheim and James Goldman did receive one Tony, for Gregg Barnes’s costume design. The $7.3 million show, directed by Signature Theatre’s Eric Schaeffer, received a total of eight nominations and had a 152-performance run on Broadway after its engagement last spring in the center’s Eisenhower Theater.

The 66th Annual Tony Awards: Red carpet: Celebrities arrived for the 66th Annual Tony Awards at the Beacon Theatre in New York. Nevertheless, it was an unusually strong night for Washington inside the Beacon Theatre during a three-hour ceremony hosted again by the comically nimble Neil Patrick Harris. In addition to the “Follies” trophy, “Clybourne Park,” Bruce Norris’s Pulitzer Prize-winning comedy-drama examining race and class in America, was honored as best play over Jon Robin Baitz’s “Other Desert Cities,” Rick Elice’s “Peter and the Starcatcher” and David Ives’s “Venus in Fur.” “Clybourne” opened at Woolly Mammoth Theatre in the District just weeks after its world premiere at Playwrights Horizons in New York and broke box-office records during a return engagement last summer. “You always anticipate failure, so when it arrives it’s not a surprise,” Norris said in the Tony press room after the award was bestowed. “So what’s happened with this play over the past 21
/
2 years is a constant surprise.”The normally press-shy Norris added that the idea for “Clybourne,” based on Lorraine Hansberry’s “A Raisin in the Sun,” went back to when he was 12 years old and saw a movie version of the play in social studies class in Houston.“The bad guy in that play was the closest [looking] person to me,” he said, adding that the fact compelled him to write about it.The Shakespeare Theatre Company, meanwhile, in the person of founding artistic director Michael Kahn, accepted the 2012 Tony for outstanding regional theater.It was the second time in four years that this special Tony went to a company from the Washington area; in 2009, Signature Theatre in Arlington was the recipient.Kahn and company celebrated the recognition at a post-Tony party at Times Square’s Renaissance Hotel. The Kennedy Center held a viewing party in a penthouse at Lincoln Center.The 66th annual awards Sunday night were considered a particularly competitive set of contests this year in many of the acting and production categories.For best musical, two shows based on not-so-successful movies were the front-runners. “Once,” adapted from a cult 2006 film, bested “Newsies,” a stage version of the 1992 Disney film. “Once” also secured wins for actor (Steve Kazee), direction (John Tiffany), orchestrations (Martin Lowe), book (Enda Walsh), set design (Bob Crowley), sound (Clive Goodwin) and lighting (Natasha Katz). Its eight awards made it the evening’s winningest show.“Peter and the Starcatcher” was the most-honored play, with five awards.Best revival of a play went, as widely expected, to “Death of a Salesman,” with another statuette going to its director, Mike Nichols. One of the evening’s most popular winners came in the category of lead actor in a play, which was won by James Corden, the exhilarating clown of “One Man, Two Guvnors.”In the tight race for best actress in a play, Nina Arianda, as the goofy seductress of Ives’s “Venus in Fur,” won in a strong field that included Tracie Bennett, giving a spookily authentic impression of Judy Garland in “End of the Rainbow,” Stockard Channing (“Other Desert Cities”), Linda Lavin (“The Lyons”) and Cynthia Nixon (“Wit”).“It’s the rarest thing in a play,” the 80-year-old Nichols said of “Salesman.” “It gets truer as time goes by.”Arianda, meanwhile, paid tribute to another octogenarian, Christopher Plummer, after he handed her the Tony. “You were my first crush!” she declared.In the categories reserved for musicals, the most momentous honor was the one bestowed on Audra McDonald — the fifth acting Tony of her career — for her performance as the sullen addict Bess of “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess.” Consider this: McDonald has appeared in nine Broadway productions since 1991 and won Tonys in more than half of them. In a desultory season for new musicals, the Tony for best score went to the mechanical “Newsies.” The awards ceremony, telecast on CBS, passed around the usual platter of ham and cheese. Production numbers from the nominated musicals (and some that were not nominated, such as “Godspell”) were efficiently shuffled on and off. The highlight of the showcases, for once, was a smart montage of live and taped snippets from the season’s plays that included two entertaining bits by Corden and Bennett.A sourer taste was left by a shameless, superfluous plug for a cruise line, in the form of a number from “Hairspray” aboard a ship in the Caribbean.

1. Packers (15-1) Maybe Aaron Rodgers can get his starting job back for the playoffs. Maybe. Jim Prisching

2. Saints (13-3) They look imposing but they will have to go outdoors and win, potentially at both San Francisco and Green Bay, to reach the Super Bowl.

3. Patriots (13-3) They're the top seed in the AFC but perhaps not an overwhelming favorite in the conference. Their most recent playoff performances have been highly disappointing.
Elise Amendola

4. 49ers (13-3) They go into the postseason playing relatively well again with three straight victories, although the last two came by narrow margins.
Seth Perlman

5. Ravens (12-4) They finally secured the division title and the second seed in the AFC, and now they'll wait to see who visits Baltimore for a conference semifinal.

6> Steelers (12-4) The reward for their 12-win season is going on the road to play a first-round playoff game against an eight-win team
Amy Sancetta

AP
7. Falcons (10-6) The final Sunday of the regular season was good to them, as they moved up to the fifth seed and avoided a first-round game at New Orleans.
David Goldman

AP
8. Giants (9-7) No one if the NFC East is particularly imposing but the Giants enter the postseason playing well and seemingly confident about their chances.
Julio Cortez

AP
9. Bengals (9-7) They lost their way into the playoff field but ended up with a first-round game at Houston that they certainly could win.

10. Lions (10-6)
If they couldn't stop Matt Flynn, how are they going to slow down Drew Brees?
