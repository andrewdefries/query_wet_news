Darrell Green on the Redskins and tradition
By Dan Steinberg
Darrell Green was on the LaVar and Dukes show on 106.7 The Fan Monday afternoon to talk about the 20th anniversary of the team’s last Super Bowl win. The way these things would typically go, the former player would go through some glorious if fading memories in the first half of the interview, and then maybe offer his thoughts on why that success hasn’t carried on in the second half of the interview.
But Green, who is not a word mincer, got right down to business. (Audio here.)
“That last nine years of my career just was a bad deal, and unfortunately they have not come out of that tailspin yet,” he said almost immediately. Which led LaVar to ask him how we got from there to here. Which led to this.
“Obviously I’m a Redskin for life, but the truth is still the truth,” Green said. “Right now, this is not the Redskins. People don’t even realize this. There’s one human that touched those days, and it’s a lady named B.J. Blanchard. She’s on the front desk, and she’s the only breathing human that is tied to some of the success from the pas.
“So it’s really not the Redskins. It’s a new group. Every human in the building is brand new. “I grew up in Texas. Mr. Moore, he died about a year ago, about 85 years old, he was my next door neighbor and he had those old beagles. And those beagles, about seven of them, hound dogs, and he never got rid of all seven and then got seven puppies. He always kept three or four of the old dogs to teach the puppies. “People talk about, oh, the Redskins. There’s no tradition where there’s no humans. Where there’s no humans, there’s no tradition. Tradition is not in buildings and names; it’s in people, and there’s not one player, one front office [employee], one weight room [employee], one front desk [employee] besides B.J. There’s nobody that’s related. “And Dan Snyder’s my friend, and he grew up here and all of that, and loved the Redskins and all that stuff. But it was pretty early that they got rid of every human — every secretary, every coach, every player — and there is no connection to the past at all....
“I think that from that vantage point they really have lost the foundation, part of the seed that was planted from generations, years ago, and there is nobody that can even talk the language. The people represent society. These kids are coming from where they come from, where there is no yes m’am, no m’am, there is no thank you, there is no concept of a lot of team and humility and denying yourself and going out there and laying it down for the team. “When you’ve got this generation, it’s about me, it’s all about me, so that makes it more important to have some of that old blood in there. Even my old kids, oh dad, you’re old, but they love me and respond to me, and I think you have to still have some of that. And most of the successful teams still have that. I believe that, I really do.”
So then Green was asked why the Redskins approached things the way they did.
“I’m not the one to ask that question,” he said. “I don’t have a clue. There’s nothing that you or I can see from the outside to say oh, this is why they did it. They got rid of the PR department, they got rid of this and this and this. It’s like each coach that comes in, they bring their son, they bring their friends. I guess it’s the same thing, he brought PR people from the other organization, they weren’t really football guys, but they’re still people that you know and you trust and you can count on. “So I’m not knocking that, but I’m just saying in this industry, I think that it’s important — like Mr. Moore next door to me as a kid — that you let some of those old dogs teach the new dogs how to chase the rabbits before they move on, so that you have a connection to the past. You continue to teach the tradition and so forth. “The only tradition we have, hallelujah, is the tradition of the people in the stands, and they talk about my grandfather, and he had the tickets, and my great this. Now, fortunately, as a businessman, that’s really [Snyder’s] blessing. That is the blessing, because THAT tradition has NOT changed. But the tradition on the field and the rest of it has.
“And if I was involved, as a counsel, I would say guys look, I don’t know how we do this, but we need to figure out how we can tap into what is the foundation of this organization.”
Would these old heads respond if the Redskins asked?
“I don’t know, I can’t answer that question,” Green said. “If the call was given out, I think the guys have enough love and passion for the team and the community, they would do whatever they could do. “I will say this, that when I played as a rookie, they had just won the Super Bowl the previous year. I came into that huddle many times and apologized to those grown men in that huddle — Dave Butz, Dexter Manley. I felt like a kid, and they were giving me an incredible responsibility to play with them and to not let them down. “And I would be so disappointed to mess up, because I respected them so much, and I don’t know if we can get that back or not. I don’t know. That’s just maybe all talk. I just know that’s what I did and that’s what I felt. I felt that. I appreciated those guys, the work they had put in and the efforts, the success, and I was NOT trying to be the guy, that because of me, they failed.”

More Robert Griffin III not yet ruled out for this week, says source, contradicting WR Pierre Garcon	By Mark Maske	December 11, 2012 at 12:23 pm More Comments
Robert Griffin III in pain on the turf at FedEx Field after his injury Sunday. (NIck Wass/AP)
Redskins wide receiver Pierre Garcon told ESPN Tuesday that backup quarterback Kirk Cousins will start against Cleveland Sunday. But a person familiar with the Redskins’ planning quickly said the team has not ruled out starting Robert Griffin III, despite Griffin’s mild knee sprain.
“Now we have a little bit tougher task,” Garcon said on ESPN. “We have Kirk starting. We have to play well around Kirk so Kirk doesn’t feel like he has to try to save the team. We have to help him to be as comfortable as possible.”
But the person, echoing what Coach Mike Shanahan said Monday, said team officials had “no idea” why Garcon made the statement during his televised interview because there had been “no change” in the Redskins’ quarterback deliberations. Shanahan said at his news conference Monday that the possibility of Griffin playing against the Browns “definitely” had not been ruled out.
When questioned further about Cousins starting, Garcon appeared to backpedal a bit, saying: “We have to prepare for the worst.”
Shanahan said Monday he didn’t know whether Griffin would be able to practice Wednesday or play Sunday. He said Griffin’s knee would be evaluated on a daily basis all week.
Shanahan said the Redskins’ would do what is in Griffin’s best interests. Taking such an approach, Shanahan said, generally is in the team’s best interests as well. Griffin’s father, Robert Griffin Jr., wrote in a text message Monday to a Washington Post reporter that he expected his son to play.
Griffin suffered a Grade 1 sprain of the lateral collateral ligament in his right knee, Shanahan announced Monday. Griffin was hit by Baltimore Ravens’ lineman Haloti Ngata late in the fourth quarter of Washington’s overtime win Sunday. Cousins replaced Griffin and engineered the 31-28 victory.
Griffin suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in the same knee in 2009 while he was at Baylor.
Cousins would make his first NFL start Sunday if Griffin does not play, with the Redskins very much in the hunt for a playoff spot.

10 surprises from 2012
By Jennifer Rubin
In some respects the 2012 presidential campaign has played out in predictable fashion. The focus has been on the economy. President Obama has tried to make Mitt Romney unacceptable. A ton of money was spent. In a polarized country the race is close. But much about the 2012 elections has surprised voters and pundits alike. Here are only 10:
1. The meltdown of GOP Senate candidates: Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock, Connie Mack IV, Tommy Thompson and George Allen have showed, one GOP insider wisecracked to me, “It must be really hard to run a competent campaign.” Some of these candidates might win, but most won’t. Republicans as a result are unlikely to take back the Senate, something that seemed very possible only a few months ago.
2. The debates were the surprise: For weeks liberals denied it, but in fact the debates (all four) fundamentally changed the trajectory of the race and the perception of Mitt Romney. Democrats didn’t expect that Romney to show up, but, candidly, Republicans were just as surprised.
3. Obama never devised a second-term agenda: Republicans for a couple of years have lived in fear that Obama might embrace Simpson-Bowles, thereby splitting the GOP and taking the middle ground in the political landscape. That he did not, and never came up with an alternative, remained for conservatives an unexpected blessing.
4. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the vice-presidential nominee, was a really good candidate: Even those conservatives including Right Turn who praised his intellect and argued in favor of him as VP didn’t fully appreciate how good a retail politician he was. In large and small settings he proved himself to be a crowd-pleaser. He kept his cool while Vice President Biden made a spectacle of himself. And when Romney was traversing a rocky spell in August, Ryan seemed to steady him and the campaign. He is, by near consensus on the right, a future leader of his party. 5. The jobs figures were a wash: With each monthly jobs report the pundits puzzled over which candidate would benefit. In fact, the majority of voters’ overall impression of the economy (either in recession or in weak recovery) has been fixed for some time. Following the Democratic National Convention, Democrats shifted somewhat on the right track/wrong track issue, but Republicans and independents never did. For them, the economy remained lousy, no matter what the Bureau of Labor Standards’ figures and adjusted figures were. 6. Likability is not a fixed phenomenon: Nearly all the mainstream media convinced themselves that Romney was unlikable, unlikable candidates can’t get elected and therefore Obama had a lock on the election. Romney did have likability problems, that is, until Americans got a good look at him for themselves. He was able to reverse the negative impression left by tens of millions of dollars in ads and hostile mainstream media. Voters, it seems, are persuadable when presented with new information. The press? Not so much. 7. The gender gap is the Achilles heel of the GOP: Pardon the mixed metaphor, but for a couple of decades it has been conventional wisdom that Republicans can’t win the women’s vote and can’t win it because of “women’s issues.” Obama certainly played that to the hilt, spending more time talking about Sandra Fluke than Benghazi and running thousands of ads hyping the abortion issue. Despite all that, Romney is likely to come close to closing the gender gap. (It is very possible he will do better with women voters than Obama will do with male voters.) Maybe abortion, contraception and the phony “war on women” are not the way to convince over half the electorate to vote for a presidential candidate.
8. Obama had a national security advantage: Democrats thought killing Osama bin Laden was sufficient. Republicans thought they could raise doubts about Obama’s handling of Iran and stormy relationship with Israel. In fact, the attack at Benghazi damaged Obama’s national security standing, at the very least making a mockery of his claim to have set al-Qaeda back on its heels. That and the defense sequestration (which Obama was forced to misrepresent as Congress’s idea) leveled the playing field on foreign policy.
9. Money matters: This election should disabuse us of the notion that all the ads and robocalls represent money well spent in an election year. We passed the saturation point in about the second week of September, causing most voters to tune it all out. When everyone has enough money, there is no advantage to be had, and, ironically, donors become less influential. In large part because the ads did come out a wash, Romney was able to make an impression in his non-ad moments, especially the debates.
10. Moderators don’t hurt conservatives: Republicans for very good reason think there is endemic media bias and that network moderators bring their own political preferences to the presidential debates. They let Obama talk longer. They interrupted Romney more. Candy Crowley inexcusably took sides in the debate. All true. But it didn’t make a lick of difference, and if anything only added to the rally-around-Romney phenomenon in the GOP base. Able Republican candidates rise above media or use media to their advantage. Mainstream media from conservatives’ vantage point may be disreputable, but conservatives can take comfort — they aren’t that influential.

A zoning change for Exxon Mobil campus?
By Jonathan O'Connell, E-mail the writer
Fairfax County officials and real estate consultants for Exxon Mobil have begun wrangling over the future of the company’s 118-acre campus in Merrifield, even though the property, which the energy giant plans to vacate, has not yet hit the market.
Irving, Tex.-based Exxon Mobil announced in the summer of 2012 that it would relocate its Fairfax County operations to Houston in early 2014. The decision is expected to move 2,100 jobs to a 385-acre office complex in Texas, part of a broader consolidation by the company. More from Capital BusinessNot your grandmother’s law firm

National’s Terminal A gets an upgrade to first class
Abha Bhattarai and Kathy Orton Carla Hall is one of several local chefs, mixologists behind the line-up of four new restaurants.
The move will put one of Fairfax County’s most valuable properties on the market. The wooded 118-acre campus in Fairfax, located at the intersection of the Capital Beltway and Route 50, was owned by Mobil when the company was acquired by Exxon in 1999, and has been the headquarters of Exxon Mobil’s management of oil refinery, lubricant production, government relations and other operations.In the spring, Exxon hired a real estate services firm Cassidy Turley to sell the campus. But for all the property’s attractiveness as a corporate headquarters, the task is not an easy one because it isn’t clear how much more a buyer might be permitted to build there. As it stands, the Exxon campus, at 3225 Gallows Rd., has about 1.3 million square feet of office space. Its secluded location near the Beltway makes it a natural for a corporate campus or a security agency headquarters. It has been discussed as a good fit for a future FBI headquarters, although Fairfax County officials would prefer to see the property sold to a private owner so it can remain on the tax rolls. Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) joined local officials in backing a location in Springfield for the agency instead.Whoever buys it will also acquire the right to build between 400,000 and 500,000 additional square feet, according to the property’s current zoning approvals. A zoning change, however, could provide a buyer with millions of more square feet to build, potentially doubling — or more — the size of the campus.Winning approval for future building would likely increase the property’s value and encourage development-minded buyers to ante up for it.Some haggling over such a change has already begun. Representatives from Cassidy Turley met recently with Fairfax County Supervisor Linda Q. Smyth (D-Providence), whose district includes the Exxon campus.Cassidy Turley representatives declined to comment on the discussions, or on their strategy for selling the campus, but Smyth said that they showed her a number of redevelopment scenarios, and she made it known to them that she is not likely to support the redevelopment of the campus into a much larger mixed-use center without major transportation upgrades.Smyth pointed out that a number of other developments are already coming to the Merrifield area, including the mixed-use Mosaic District and multiple apartment projects adjacent to the Dunn Loring-Merrifield Metro station. “It’s a lovely site, but it doesn’t work for everything,” she said.The road network, she said, wasn’t designed to handle any traffic beyond that. “When we did the planning originally for Merrifield, we specifically looked at the transportation and began to think about what the capacity is for that road network, and whatever planned improvements for that road network that we could see,” Smyth said. “So our transportation network for the Merrifield area is pretty much maxed out.”Smyth said she thought increasing the density on the site would require changing the area’s comprehensive plan, which constitutes extensive gathering of opinions from residents.“That presents its own set of challenges. Once you open something up like that, be careful what you wish for. We would have to go through a community planning framework,” she said.

PHOTOS| Le Diplomate Book review: In ‘Ripper,’ Isabel Allende sends up the mystery tradition
By Maureen Corrigan, E-mail the writers
Isabel Allende is a literary force to be reckoned with. Almost everything she writes turns into a bestseller, including her fiction (12 works to date), memoirs (four) and works of young adult fiction (three). Worldwide, her books have sold more than 60 million copies. What worlds are left to be conquered when you’re this much of a colossus? Allende’s answer is elementary: thrillers. Like J.K. Rowling, whose first whodunit, “The Cuckoo’s Calling,” appeared this past spring, Allende has decided to get out of her already capacious comfort zone and try her hand at a straight suspense plot. The result is an ornate ­serial-killer tale with the rather tired title of “Ripper.”
Allende (again, like Rowling) seems to want to send up the mystery tradition as much as she wants to stake her claim to it. Throughout “Ripper,” she tosses out coy references to masters of the genre, such as Stieg Larsson, Dashiell Hammett
and Arthur Conan Doyle. Allende’s gargantuan cast of characters (and suspects) is every bit as eccentric as ye olde villagers in any classic Golden Age cozy. There’s a diminutive female police detective and martial-arts expert named Petra Horr, who dyes her cropped hair “so it looked like a foxtail,” a Croatian soothsayer whose astral charts aid the police, and a supporting slew of aroma therapists, homeopaths, Reiki masters and acupuncturists — this story takes place in contemporary San Francisco, after all.
(Harper) - \"Ripper\" by Isabel Allende Photos of the day: March 6, 2014
Oscar Pistorius trial, tensions in Ukraine, Prince Harry attends Invictus games, unusual fish from the deep and more.

Free admission Get ideas The chief investigators here are a group of misfit kids from around the world who connect via an Internet crime game, also called “Ripper.” One of those kids, 16-year-old Amanda Jackson, happens to be the daughter of San Francisco’s deputy homicide chief, a guy who (improbably) discloses to his daughter the inside dope on a slew of grisly murders terrorizing the city. Amanda’s mother — who’s divorced from Detective Loose Lips — is named Indiana. She’s a holistic New Age healer: “a tall, voluptuous blond . . . with the looks of an inflatable doll.” Given that description, it comes as no surprise that Indiana is the object of desire for pretty much everyone in this novel, including the deranged killer. While Allende’s plot is decoratively spattered with blood, she otherwise follows the Agatha Christie polite approach toward murder: She stuffs her story with a lot of corpses whose outlandish deaths mostly take place in the wings.Spice, not suspense, turns out to be Allende’s signature contribution to the standard serial-killer tale. Indeed, so hot and heaving are the love scenes in “Ripper” that “Bodice-Ripper” would have been a more apt title. Most of the story focuses not on the race to track down the homicidal maniac but on the less urgent question of which of her suitors Indiana prefers: Alan, a 50-ish roué whose family owns vast chunks of San Francisco, or Ryan, a reclusive former Navy SEAL maimed in body and soul by his wartime service. The rivals vie for Indiana’s affections, and so, we readers are regularly treated to fantasy interludes such as this one, where Indiana recalls a night when Alan whisked her off to a suite at the Fairmont Hotel:“Ah, the perfumed water, the vast cotton towels, the perfectly chilled wine, the exquisite food, the loving caresses. . . . Once, after they had watched ‘Cleopatra’ on television . . . she mentioned that the best thing in the movie was Cleopatra bathing in milk. Alan had leaped out of bed . . . and re­appeared half an hour later . . . carrying three boxes of powdered milk that he emptied into the Jacuzzi so that she could bathe like a Hollywood pharaoh.” Contrasted with the luxurious decadence offered by Alan, working stiff Ryan offers Indiana the rough delights to be found in the back of his truck: “She clung to Ryan now, holding him down with both hands and kissing him until he gasped for breath — surprised at the softness of his lips, the taste of his saliva, the intimacy of his tongue, frantically trying to take off her jacket, sweater, and blouse without breaking the kiss.” As these passages suggest, there’s a heck of a lot more Harlequin than Hammett to be found on the pages of “Ripper.” Allende does conjure up a genuinely surprising twist at the end, but by then, most smart readers will be trying to cleanse all memory of this tedious romp, perhaps by sinking down, down, down into bathtubs of powdered milk.
Corrigan, who teaches literature at Georgetown University, is the book critic for the NPR program “Fresh Air.”

PHOTOS| Le Diplomate Theater review: Folger’s ‘Romeo and Juliet’ has a tough cookie for a heroine
(Teresa Wood) - Erin Weaver and Michael Goldsmith star in Folger Theatre’s Romeo and Juliet.
CAPTION
By Peter Marks, E-mail the writer
“Shut . . . the . . . door!” Erin Weaver’s seething Juliet exclaims through clenched jaw, as she and Eric Hissom’s dazed Friar Lawrence hunker down to absorb the latest shock waves racing through the streets and hearts of fair Verona.
The line reverberates with uncharacteristic intensity in Folger Theatre’s slightly weird “Romeo and Juliet” — an erratic but not an uninteresting evening — because Weaver’s Juliet is not your average swooning teen. No, this Juliet is one tough cookie, and perhaps the production’s freshest idea. Bearing sturdy gaze, toned arms and Clark Kent glasses, Weaver projects a kind of superhero-level of self-assurance that makes firmly convincing the notion of Juliet leading smitten, goofy-grinning Romeo (Michael Goldsmith) around by the nose.

Free admission Get ideas Director Aaron Posner, whose fine Folger work has included a wry “Measure for Measure,” commedia-inflected “The Comedy of Errors” and sorcery-filled “Macbeth,” here takes on the saddest love story ever told and fiddles with it in ways that make it recognizably his. He’s been known to push his concepts too far at times: Witness his shtick-driven “The Taming of the Shrew” last year. On this occasion, the tinkering burns off some of the tragedy’s heat: Though Weaver’s Juliet has stature and Goldsmith’s Romeo a convincing earnestness, the bred-in-the-bone hatred between the Capulets and Montagues never materializes powerfully, and so the dangers facing the couple aren’t as apparent as they need to be, either.It must be noted, however, that this director is such an enterprising steward of Shakespeare that even his odder impulses merit attention, and his more problematic forays deserve to be digested and discussed.With this project, you imagine Posner thinking: “Look, you know this play and I know this play, so let’s try some new things.” This what-if approach should be a path to rediscovery, but in this case it hasn’t unleashed the play’s excitement. Then again, what version since Franco Zeffirelli’s peerless 1968 film has been able to lend definitive exuberance and dewiness to the tale’s ardor and sorrow? Certainly not the current gimmick-laden Broadway staging with Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad, one that replaces passion with doves and motorcycles and pillars of fire and levitating beds.Posner’s effort is more worthy, even if its shortcomings also require cataloguing. Some of the tweaks are signatures, as in his skillful use of film-style scene cross-cutting. Others are downright jarring: Did you ever wonder, for instance, about Lady Montague’s bouts of suicidal depression or Lord Capulet’s tendency to strike women? Neither, one gathers, did Shakespeare. (Curiously, Brian Dykstra’s hyperdramatic Lord Capulet displays more hostility toward Shannon Koob’s graceful and unusually kindly Lady Capulet than he does toward Romeo.)Despite the use of custom-made weaponry, the swordplay among Romeo, Tybalt (Rex Daugherty) and Mercutio (Brad Koed) provokes not a single thrill. And if the skeletal, 13-member cast imposes limits on what can be staged, some of the textual trims seem arbitrary. No sobering final oration from Prince Escalus? No riposte by Balthazar (Matthew McGee) to Romeo’s “For nothing can be ill, if she be well”? No scene, even, in which the Nurse (Sherri Edelen) discovers Juliet in her bedchamber in the drug-induced limbo that is mistaken for death?Still, within the strictures of Posner’s design, a lively intelligence also reveals itself, typified by Meghan Raham’s sleekly abstract set, with illuminated drawings and chests filled with those mortal drugs embedded in the walls. Laree Lentz’s up-to-the-minute costumes — is Count Paris (Joe Mallon) emulating kids today and wearing pajama bottoms in public? — and the emotionally grounded performances from the likes of Hissom and Edelen offer added value. And most crucially, in the central relationship, you get a persuasive portrait of a complicated attraction, not one fermented in a vat of sugary bliss. Posner manipulates our first glimpse of the lovers — each engaged here in the solitary pastime of reading a book — so that for their fateful meeting at the Capulets’ ball, the notion has been planted that good looks are not all they have in common.Goldsmith has a scruffy charm, of the kind possessed by that nice guy in AP English who all the smart girls like. (Although it should be noted that neither Goldsmith nor Weaver, who’s married to Posner, looks like a teenager.) The famous balcony scene is sweetly carried off: Weaver appears on the set’s upper level with a stuffed toy to which she delivers her “What’s Montague?” speech: “It is nor hand, nor foot/Nor arm, nor face . . .” Tellingly, Juliet tosses the toy away as she contemplates the young man she barely knows but will shortly wed.Juliet’s casting off of girlhood is the evening’s thematic glue, for this “Romeo and Juliet” more emphatically identifies Juliet as the stronger, more decisive of the two than any production I’ve seen. This is a consequence of Weaver’s athletic presence and energetic assertiveness: You are reminded that it is Juliet, for example, who first brings up the subject of marriage. And it is Juliet who, in the afterglow of their only night together, determines that it is indeed the lark that is singing and so sends Romeo off.Nothing feels quite as concretely worked out in this production as the super-fast growing up of Juliet. And while it’s not a long sit, you wait in vain for many of the other conceits to show a commensurate sharpness of vision.

Editorial Review
Nature is embraced in movement pieceBy Lisa TraigerFriday, Feb. 17, 2012Being nude on stage isn't so hard. Just take your clothes off. But being naked? That's far more challenging.
"Naked is different than nude," says Eiko, of the contemporary performance duo Eiko & Koma, which performs its newest work, "Fragile," at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center next week. "Nude," she adds, "has different implications about the objectivity of the body, its selling and buying and seducing, and about the intentionality of being nude or being seen nude."
"Fragile" is based on an earlier work the duo called "Naked," and, like that one, they will perform without clothing. But, as Eiko points out, they won't be nude. "Naked is more existential and more interesting," she says. "What's important for me is the nakedness itself. Nude has sexual connotations, but the main idea with naked is it's the whole body and the whole mind that is present."
The Japanese American couple have been making singular movement pieces together since 1972, a year after they met in Japan. They found their way to Tatsumi Hijikata's company in Tokyo, where butoh, the distinctive brand of dance and theater that evolved in the apocalyptic period after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since 1976, Eiko and Koma have developed their one-of-a-kind style, performing in theaters, festivals, galleries, in a trailer-like caravan, in a river, beneath a tree and in parks and gardens. "Fragile" will be presented in the comfort of the intimate Kogod Theatre, but its four-hour length lends it the feel of a gallery installation. Audience members can stay for a few moments or for the entire work.
In a bow to the butoh tradition, Eiko and Koma frequently paint their bodies with white rice powder and decorate the stage with natural elements - branches, leaves, feathers, stones, dirt, even rice. They inhabit a world that's part human and part animal, their movement sometimes so excruciatingly slow that they appear still, until you realize they've changed positions.
Eiko jokes that looking back to their earliest performances, they were often semi-nude or nude. But, she says, "we were so young and looking very beautiful that it maybe looked more like nude photos in an artistic way. Now as we get older, our bodies age and our naked pieces, they become even more naked."
The experimental group Kronos Quartet will accompany the performers, and there are sure to be some surprises. Ten days out, the group's founder, David Harrington, was still imagining the musical possibilities.
"I'm thinking of the music for the evening as presents to [Eiko and Koma] from each of us individually and from our group," said Harrington, who is an avid collaborator with the innovative dance duo whenever the opportunity arises. "I'm also hoping the audience will have no idea what's going to happen next."

Washington-Lee ‘Best Buddies’ celebrate fundraising success with night of football
By Susan Svrluga, Before the Washington-Lee High School football game Friday night in Arlington, student volunteers in the Best Buddies program and their “buddies” — students with intellectual or developmental disabilities — will join the team for dinner and meet actress Lauren Potter from the television show “Glee.”
The Washington-Lee chapter of Best Buddies, founded just two years ago, raised more money for the nonprofit group than any other middle or high school chapter in the Washington area. With bake sales, a car wash and personal appeals, the chapter has pulled in $4,500 so far as part of a fundraising challenge.Several members of the Washington-Lee Generals football team participate in the club, which has more than 100 members. At least two football players, Benjamin Bean and Trevor McManus, are matched with buddies.The chapter will attend the team’s pre-game dinner, then scrimmage with the team. After the scrimmage, they will watch the Generals face off against the Hayfield Hawks from Fairfax County. Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m.On Saturday, there will be a cycling fundraiser in Washington with more than 2,000 volunteers expected to race 20, 50 or 100 miles to benefit Best Buddies International. Catholic University has raised the most money in the challenge so far, more than $7,600.

Downturn Puts Strain On School Boundaries
NEWS | LOCAL | POLITICS | SPORTS | OPINIONS | BUSINESS | ARTS & LIVING | GOING OUT GUIDE | JOBS | CARS | REAL ESTATE |SHOPPING Downturn Puts Strain On School Boundaries
Redistricting Has Fewer Alternatives
By Michael Birnbaum
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, December 30, 2008
As the economic outlook grows increasingly bleak, school systems in the Washington region are delaying construction and even considering shuttering schools, moves that could force wide-scale shuffling of students among campuses and disrupt deep connections that students and families have to neighborhood schools.
This month, Prince George's County's interim superintendent, William R. Hite Jr., proposed closing six under-enrolled schools and parceling out those students to other schools.
Prince William County is considering putting plans for a badly needed high school on hold, a decision that would result in shifting students to balance enrollments.
Loudoun County is facing delayed construction of schools planned for fast-growing neighborhoods and the prospect of closing a handful of under-enrolled schools.
The budget crunch is hitting schools in many ways, forcing increases in class size and cutbacks in staff and programs, but the possibility of uprooting students could be among the most painful for students and their families.
Boundary changes can cause heartache and outrage as students are plucked out of one school and dropped in another, separating them from their friends, teachers, sports teams and clubs. Families that settled in neighborhoods based on the local schools could find that they will be sending their children somewhere unexpected. The changes can be especially hard at the high school level.
"I know a lot of parents here are loading up the pitchforks and shovels now, in case the peasant revolution has to start in January," when proposals for boundaries in Loudoun will be unveiled, said Ed Sugg, whose children attend Little River Elementary School and Mercer Middle School, both in the southeastern part of the county.
School budgets have been hit hard as plummeting home sales and property values have forced local governments to hunt for spending cuts. The situation grew worse this month when Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) proposed cutting $425 million in state funding for education, including eliminating $83 million in state assistance for school construction.
The biggest impact on school boundaries is expected in Loudoun, where officials will consider redrawing attendance areas for nearly half the schools, including four of 10 high schools. The county Board of Supervisors put the kibosh on school construction in the fiscal year that starts in July, citing the county's budget shortfall and the difficulty of issuing bonds in the tight credit market. School officials said they have been told that the hiatus might stretch to 2011.
But student growth hasn't stopped. The 57,000-student school system expects nearly 2,500 additional students in the 2009 school year and more than 2,800 in 2010. That spells massive shifts in student population to use existing capacity more efficiently.
If the budget picture grows more dire, school officials said, four elementary schools with dwindling enrollment in the western part of the county -- Aldie, Hillsboro, Lincoln and Middleburg -- could be closed.
"I think it's going to get real dicey around here," said Sam Adamo, director of planning and legislative services for Loudoun schools. "These will be the most challenging boundary changes we've ever faced."
Prince George's County school officials have not identified the six schools that could be closed, so it is unknown which communities could face a boundary battle.
Decisions over which students will be displaced from their neighborhood schools spark strong emotional reactions from parents and students.
Two years ago, when Loudoun officials last considered tweaking the boundaries for Stone Bridge High School in Ashburn, more than 400 people spoke at a hearing.
"I think a lot of people want to go to Stone Bridge, and it might cause a lot of grief if they find out they can't," said Arlene Stark, a vice president of the Stone Bridge PTSO.
The construction halt in Loudoun is a striking move for a system that has opened 25 schools since 2002, growth that also led to frequent boundary changes. Some parents have grown accustomed to upheaval.
"At this point with the growth out here, unfortunately, it's become regular for us," said Barb Frick, a vice president of the PTO at Legacy Elementary School in Ashburn, another target for changes.
By delaying the opening of planned schools, school systems save the cash needed to hire teachers and other staff members and to outfit classrooms with books and equipment.
Prince William's School Board was scheduled to vote this month on whether to go forward with construction of a high school that would relieve crowding in schools in the western part of the county. The proposal would probably enjoy smooth sailing in most years but is in serious doubt this time around. The meeting was the same day that Kaine announced that the state would be cutting education funding, and the board delayed the vote to study the impact.
If the high school is voted down, the county could face boundary revisions, said David Beavers, supervisor of planning and financial services for the Prince William school system.

A bill being crafted in the Senate would lump mortgage lenders with chartered banks in regards to federal oversight, but it would exempt payday lenders, automobile dealers and pawnbrokers.

Payday lenders, pawnbrokers, car dealers and other companies that make loans but do not hold bank charters would be shielded from the scrutiny of a proposed federal consumer protection regulator under the terms of a tentative compromise between senators who are attempting to craft a bipartisan bill.
Under the proposal, the regulator would hold broad authority to write rules protecting borrowers, but officials would make regular compliance checks only at banks and, for the first time, at mortgage lenders, a step that still would exclude some of the nation's largest and most controversial lending industries.
The Obama administration has pushed to place nearly all lenders under federal oversight for the first time, but Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) insisted on limiting the scope of the proposed consumer regulator as a condition of his negotiations over a broader package of regulatory reforms with Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), the chairman of the banking committee, according to several people familiar with the negotiations.
Republicans argue that there is no reason for increased oversight, at considerable expense, of industries that played no role in the financial crisis.
But the proposed exclusion of those industries has drawn opposition from an unlikely alliance of consumer advocates and banking trade groups, who argue that the government should impose equal stringencies on all lenders, banks and non-banks alike.
"The point of the agency is to provide a cop on the beat that focuses where the problems are, not a cop that's fenced off from some of the worst actors," said Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law professor who helped to shape the administration's proposal for the new agency.
Even the Defense Department has chimed in, sending a letter to the Treasury Department urging oversight of auto lenders because of a pattern of abusive lending to military personnel.
"We believe the intervention of the [Consumer Financial Protection Agency] in overseeing auto financing and sales for service members will help protect them and will assist us in reducing the concerns they have over their financial well-being," Defense Undersecretary Clifford Stanley wrote in a letter dated Feb. 26.
Corker said in an interview Wednesday that he wanted to adopt a more consistent approach than the financial reform legislation passed by the House in December, which excluded some kinds of lenders, including auto dealers and pawnbrokers, from the new agency's jurisdiction.
"The House had all kinds of carve-outs," he said. "We wanted to take a more consistent approach, to make rule-making apply across the entire financial industry."
A Dodd spokeswoman declined to comment beyond noting that negotiations are still in progress.
Dodd's efforts to push reform legislation through the Senate continue to depend on his ability to command the support of at least some Republicans, which has forced him to seek a compromise with Corker on the shape of the new consumer regulator.
The key remaining issue is how differences should be resolved between the consumer regulator and agencies charged with keeping banks in good health. One proposal would create an appeals board, in part composed of other regulators, to resolve conflicts.
On other major issues, the outlines of a deal already are in place. The regulator would be led by a presidential appointee with independent funding and probably placed inside the Federal Reserve. It would have authority to write rules that apply to most lenders, consolidating powers now held by many agencies.
Under current law, only banks are subject to regular examinations for compliance with those rules. The Federal Trade Commission holds broad authority to pursue evidence of abuse by non-bank lenders, but it lacks the mandate and resources to conduct examinations. Corker's proposal, which Dodd accepted several weeks ago, would empower the new consumer regulator to examine mortgage lenders other than banks.
Aides to Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the banking committee, proposed extending examination authority solely to the largest mortgage lenders during talks with Dodd's staff earlier this year. Dodd and Corker hammered out their compromise after those talks broke down. The deal also includes a provision that would allow the consumer regulator to seek oversight of particular companies or industries if it could show a pattern of consumer complaints or abuse.
Banking groups generally exert tremendous influence on Capitol Hill, and they are pressing senators to reconsider.
"These non-banks are making the same kinds of loans, they're dealing with consumers with a lot of the same types of products," said Steve Verdier of the Independent Community Bankers of America. "That proposal to cover the banks and the mortgage banks is fighting the last war. We don't know where the next problem is going to be, and if we leave a loophole open, we know it's going to happen somewhere else and the consumers are not going to be protected."
But opponents of increased regulation have pressed their case effectively.
Ed Tonkin, chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said the practices cited by the Defense Department are already illegal.
"Creating new regulatory mandates on top of the numerous federal and state requirements that already govern auto financing will only drive up costs, limit vehicle financing options and, for many consumers, effectively eliminate their ability to obtain financing to meet their vehicle needs," Tonkin said.

BET special fails to air Sunday night

Do not adjust your television sets: The BET special celebrating the network's 30th anniversary scheduled for Sunday evening was nowhere to be found. The show, "BET 30: Moments and Movements," was supposed to air from 8 to 10 p.m.
An e-mail from a BET press representative sent to The Post at 7:30 p.m., half an hour before the show was to air, said, "It appears that we will not be airing the BET special this evening." No explanation was given.
The BET rep said she would "have the re-air date shortly." The BET Web site was still promoting the Sunday show and a related sweepstakes at 9 p.m., after the show had already been postponed.
The show postponement attracted comments to the BET Web site from upset viewers from around the country. A viewer from Philadelphia wrote, "I'm very disappointed. BET should at least place a notation at the bottom of the [TV] screen with details of when" the show will air.

If you're looking into government employment or have been hired only recently, possibly the last thing on your mind is retirement.

Still, you should understand that benefit. It could be important in your career planning. One reason so many federal employees stay with the government is that its retirement benefits stack up well against what's available elsewhere¿so well that they're often called "golden handcuffs" because they induce people to stick around for the payoff at the end.
In recent years many private sector employers have dropped "defined benefit" programs, which are traditional retirement programs that pay a certain amount based on a formula involving the employee's years of service and salary level. If they have retirement programs at all, they're more likely to offer "defined contribution" plans such as 401(k)s where the employer and employee typically make a contributions but the money available to the employee at retirement depends on the earnings of those contributions.
The government, though, offers both types of benefits.
