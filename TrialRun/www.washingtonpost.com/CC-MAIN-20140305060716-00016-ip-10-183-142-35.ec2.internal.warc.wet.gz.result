Norton gets in heated House floor dispute ... over a New York racetrack?
By Ben Pershing
D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) engaged in a heated dispute on the House floor Tuesday night with a Republican colleague, even apologizing for having violated the chamber's decorum with words that her debate opponent thought were too harsh.
So what were Norton and Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R) arguing about? D.C. voting rights? The District's gun laws? Actually, the spat stemmed from something unrelated to either D.C. or Utah -- the Saratoga Race Course in upstate New York.
Let's go back to the starting gate: Just after 5 p.m. on a relatively uneventful legislative day, Norton was on the House floor bringing forth a series of uncontroversial measures for quick consideration by the chamber, including a bill to name a post office. Then she brought up H.Res. 1513, a bill sponsored by New York Rep. Scott Murphy (D) congratulating Saratoga -- which Norton called "one of the world's greatest sports venues" -- on the start of its 142nd season in operation.
Such measures usually pass through the House without event, but Chaffetz has been complaining in recent months about the chamber's propensity for spending its valuable time congratulating sports teams left and right .
So on Tuesday, Chaffetz stood up and said that, since "we have so many problems and challenges facing the country," the resolution seemed trivial.
"I'm sure there are some young kids that are here," Chaffetz said. "They're going to go back and talk about their time at the House of Representatives, and they're here in the audience. And they're going to go back and talk to their teachers and the teachers are going to ask, What did you talk about? Did you talk about the war on terror? Did you talk about the debt? Oh, no. They were honoring a race course. A race course. So it's terribly frustrating."
Things went downhill from there. "If I had a dime for every trivial bill the minority has put on this floor, I could retire as a rich woman," Norton responded, accusing Chaffetz and his fellow Republicans of hypocrisy.
After a couple of intervening speakers, Norton and Chaffetz got back into it, on the subject of whether Chaffetz had "the political guts" to vote against Republican-sponsored sports resolutions. And then Norton invoked a bill Chaffetz himself had sponsored. Let's go to the videotape, courtesy of C-SPAN:
"Just let me say to the gentleman," Norton said, reading from her Blackberry, "it's been pointed out to me that the gentleman cosponsored a resolution, H. Res. 942, commending the Real Salt Lake Soccer Club for winning the 2009 Major League Soccer Cup. I just don't think it lies in the gentleman's mouth to come to the floor and put down this member."
That's when Chaffetz moved to have Norton's words "taken down," a relatively rare occurrence where one lawmaker accuses the other of violating the House's rules of decorum. After a lengthy pause during which chamber officials conferred with each other, Norton got back up and apologized.
"Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove from the record an idiomatic expression that apparently was misunderstood," Norton explained. "I never called the gentleman dishonest. I want to strike the words 'lie in his mouth,' which is an idiomatic expression that means the gentleman has no business saying what he said. But if it is construed to mean that I'm calling him a liar, then I would certainly ask that that be stricken from the record. Indeed, my comments were begun with words about civility here, so I certainly did not intend to call the gentleman dishonest or a liar."
Chaffetz then withdrew his objection, and explained that "yes, I've voted for sports resolutions, I've even cosponsored resolutions, but I came to realize what a waste of time that is. So a number of weeks ago, I took the pledge that I was no longer going to participate."
Eventually, the debate concluded and the chamber moved on to other business. The actual vote on the Saratoga bill was postponed until Wednesday. Meanwhile, we're eager to see what might happen between Norton and Chaffetz the next time a team or venue from D.C. -- rather than New York -- does something worthy of a House resolution.

Accident blocking outer loop lane before Penn. Ave.
By Mark Berman
8:50 A.M. Update:
An accident on the inner loop of the Beltway at I-66 is blocking the right shoulder.
The accident on southbound 16th Street at P Street NW has been cleared and the right lane reopened.
And we have more information on the earlier accident on I-95 North in Dumfries: A commuter bus heading to Fort Belvoir swerved, hit the guard rail and stopped in a ditch three feet deep, according to the Virginia State Police. The bus driver told police they swerved to avoid a vehicle that had swerved into the same lane; that vehicle kept going and wasn’t located. There were seven passengers on the bus, and all injuries were minor; the bus driver, who was wearing a seat belt, was uninjured, according to the state police.
8:35 A.M. Update:
An accident on the outer loop of the Beltway before Pennsylvania Avenue is blocking one lane and one of the shoulders.
8:30 A.M. Update:
The accident at Georgia Avenue and Randolph Street NW involving a D.C. school bus and a Metrobus has caused no injuries and isn’t blocking any lanes, according to police.
8:15 A.M. Update:
There’s an accident at Georgia Avenue and Randolph Street NW involving a D.C. school bus and a Metrobus, according to the D.C. police.
An accident on southbound 16th Street at P Street NW is blocking the right lane.
8:05 A.M. Update:
Traffic signals are out at 11th and P streets NW, so use caution when approaching the intersection. Officers are on the scene helping direct traffic.
7:55 A.M. Update:
The accident on southbound Georgia Avenue at Kansas Avenue NW has been cleared and all lanes reopened, according to police.
A disabled vehicle on southbound DC-295 at 11th Street SE is on the right shoulder and out of the main travel lanes, so it shouldn’t impact traffic too much.
7:45 A.M. Update:
The accident on southbound Branch Avenue/MD 5 at Brandywine Road has been cleared and the two southbound lanes have reopened. Expect residual delays in this area.
An accident on southbound Georgia Avenue at Kansas Avenue NW is blocking the left southbound lane. 7:30 A.M. Update:
The accident on I-95 North at Dumfries Road has been cleared from the right lane and right shoulder. Expect residual delays approaching Dumfries.
7:15 A.M. Update:
A disabled vehicle on the inner loop of the Beltway at the Leesburg Pike is blocking the left shoulder.
An accident on the outer loop of the Beltway at Braddock Road is blocking the left shoulder.
6:55 A.M. Update:
An accident on southbound Branch Avenue/MD 5 at Brandywine Road is blocking two southbound lanes and one of the shoulders. Avoid Branch Road if you can help it. The earlier accident on I-270 South at I-370 has been cleared up.
6:50 A.M. Update:
And now VRE reports that the CSX signal/switch problems have been resolved. Trains might still encounter some residual delays due to congestion between Alexandria and Crystal City.
Train 300 is currently running 25 minutes late due to the signal problems, while train 302 is running 15 minutes late and 324 is running 10 minutes behind schedule. All other VRE trains are currently on time. 6:45 A.M. Update:
Virginia Railway Express riders should expect delays this morning. CSX is experiencing signal/switch problems between Alexandria and Crystal City, delaying trains by 10 to 20 minutes in this area, according to VRE. 6:40 A.M. Update:
Metro reports that normal service has resumed at Braddock Road, so delays should be clearing.
6:25 A.M. Update:
There could be delays on the Yellow Line heading to Huntington due to a train malfunction at Braddock Road. 6:20 A.M. Update:
The accident on I-95 North at Dumfries Road continues to block the right lane and right shoulder.
An accident on northbound I-270 before I-370 could cause delays there, but no lane closures are reported yet.
Original Post:
Good morning, commuters! We’ll be keeping an eye on the roads and rails this morning, reporting any delays or issues — and we will need your help. If you hear about any congestion, delays, problems or anything at all, tell us in the comments section below or by tweeting @drgridlock.
It’s going to be warmer than it was on Tuesday, according to the Capital Weather Gang. There could be some afternoon or evening rain, bu the morning should be clear.
So far:
— An accident on I-95 North at Dumfries Road is blocking the right lane and right shoulder.
— There were some delays for Red Line trains heading to Glenmont after a train malfunctioned at Takoma. Metro reports that normal service is back at Takoma, so delays should be clearing up.
