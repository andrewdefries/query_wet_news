Taste of DC dishes that will punch your ticket
By Lavanya Ramanathan
Dickson’s banh mi is among the fancy fare that you can try at this weekend’s Taste of DC festival. (Evy Mages for The Washington Post)If you’re headed to this weekend’s Taste of DC, make sure you bring your appetite. Dozens of Washington’s poshest restaurants are pulling out their best fare for the three-day festival.
Taste of DC ran successfully for years on a steady diet of kabobs, pizza and eggrolls until the festival simply disappeared in 2003. Beginning Saturday, it’s back for the first time in eight years with higher-end eats that reflect the city’s new restaurant boom.
The festival asked each eatery to offer one dish that you can snag for two tickets, and many are also offering bigger plates for three or four tickets. If you snag the festival’s online-only deal for 20 tickets for $25, each ticket will run you $1.33 apiece (including the small service charge).
So, which booths should you hit? Luke’s Lobster’s lobster roll will be a steal at at the Luke’s booth (
5 tickets; expect it to go fast). The lobster roll from Luke's Lobster. (Photo by Susan Biddle for The Washington Post)
It’s a great time to check out Washington’s new cafe Wicked Waffle, which offers an assortment of waffle sandwiches. The most compelling for foodies? The hoisin duck sandwich (4 tickets). Co Co. Sala will bring its two most raved-about dishes, the choco-bacon-topped macaroni and cheese and the Chocolate Onyx dessert, both clocking in at 2 tickets. Banh mi (along with tacos and gourmet burgers) will be everywhere this year, but you should try the ones at Dickson’s booth. The Vietnamese sandwich comes in chicken, pork belly or beef ribeye varieties for 5 tickets. (Sauca will do its banh mi for 2 tickets, in case you’re wondering.) The new Cajun Experience brings several dishes to rep its Louisiana roots, but the one to get has to be its tasty etouffee (2 tickets).
One of our favorite late-night snack stops is (finally) serving its delicious, flaky fare in the light of day: the U Street club Patty Boom Boom brings four varieties of patties (all of which must be experienced with the sweet, peppery mango sauce). The ones to try: the curry vegetable patty and the guava goat. (2 tickets)
Nirvana Express will fire up the dosa griddle. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) Someone at Nirvana Express must have heard our prayers for street dosa, because the restaurant will be serving the fiery, crispy South Indian crepe with the traditional sambhar and coconut chutney, and its new-fangled falafel-stuffed version of the classic. (5 tickets).
While there will be many a slider floating around, Lincoln’s barbecue pulled-pork incarnation looks promising (
2 tickets). And finally, you’d be remiss if you didn’t get the grilled fish tacos from Surfside (8 tickets). By	Lavanya Ramanathan

Why a school district rejected $2.5 million federal grant
By Valerie Strauss
In these troubled economic times, it would take a lot for a school district to turn down a gift of $2.5 million. But that’s just what the Oregon City School District
has done.
The 8,100-student district was part of a group of school systems and a non-profit organization that applied to the federal government for a federal grant through the “Teacher Incentive Fund.” That fund awards money to districts that agree to implement performance-based compensation systems in high-needs schools for teachers and principals that include the use of standardized test scores and merit pay.
Officials in Oregon City’s district and teachers union thought, according to the Oregonian, that they could take the money — which the coalition won in 2010 — without implementing performance pay.
But the district, which has spent $55,000 of the $2.54 million grant, has been unable to come up with a merit pay plan, so it is leaving the program and therefore won’t use the rest of its allotted money, the newspaper reported. The U.S. Department of Education refused a request from the district to allow it to implement a plan that did not use test scores to hand out performance bonuses.
District Superintendent Larry Didway was quoted by the Oregonian as saying: “We certainly, as a team, do not believe that providing an incentive to teachers based on increased test scores of any individuals is going to make a difference in student achievement."
Right he is, and it’s past time that the Education Department acknowledged that there is no real evidence that using test scores for evaluation is a valid and reliable assessment tool. The National Research Council issued a report earlier this year concluding that incentive programs for schools, teachers and students aimed at raising standardized test scores are largely unproductive in generating increased student achievement. The council is the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine. Other studies too, have found fault with the validity of “value added” methods that are used to evaluate teachers and principals based on student standardized test scores, yet the Obama administration continues to push reforms that use this approach. Some of the best performing school districts in the country right here in the Washington D.C. area — such as Fairfax County and Montgomery County, manage to have fine evaluation systems without using test scores. When will the federal government get the message?

‘MAN OF STEEL’: Want to dig deeper into Superman’s past? Here are our 14 recommended reads
By David Betancourt
E-mail the writer
ED. NOTE: Throughout the week, Comic Riffs has focused on facets of Superman — the big, blue birthday boy — in advance of the new “Man of Steel.”
— M.C.
JUST MINUTES before tonight’s midnight release of "Man of Steel” (we’re in line now), ComiXology is allowing Superman fans to stock up on many of the comics that are source material for the movie — thanks to the website’s Superman 201 99-cents digital comics sale.
This kind of sale, of course, makes a fanboy’s heart leap in a single bound. So if you're looking to dive into some of the best Superman stories ever told, here are some can't-miss Superman picks from among the 200-plus comics available for the sale:
Action Comics #1 (1938):
Although you won't be able to sell a digital version of Superman's first appearance in a comic for millions, why not take a look at the book that started it all. It’s great to see how far Superman has evolved since he came onto the scene in 1938. The book that started it all.
(METROPOLIS COLLECTIBLES via AP - .)
Superman Annual #11 (1984):
"For the Man Who Has Everything," was written by Alan Moore and drawn by Dave Gibbons, the same team that brought us "Watchmen." On his birthday, Superman is visited by Batman, Robin and Wonder Woman, but he's in a coma after a plant called the "black mercy" latches onto him, feeding him realistic dreams supposedly linked to his strongest desires. Superman dreams of a Krypton that never exploded, and of the life on his home planet he never had.
[75TH ANNIVERSARY: From Waid to Gaiman, we ask creators: Why does Superman endure?] Action Comics #584-599 (1986-88):
Any time you crack a comic book by John Byrne, you’re in for a treat. If it’s a Superman book, all the better. Byrne has been one of the best in the business at drawing Superman. This 16-issue run on Action Comics frequently featured Superman and a guest star.
The Man of Steel #1-6 (1986):
Another story written and drawn by Byrne, this served for years as the definitive post-Crisis on Infinite Earths origin for Superman. [‘MAN OF STEEL’: Hans Zimmer soars with new score]
Action Comics #662 (1991):
This is the issue in which Clark Kent finally reveals to Lois Lane that when the glasses come off, he's more than just a reporter. Now before you go all crazy on Lois for not knowing, remember: Superman doesn't wear a mask, the thinking goes, so there's no reason for the public to think he has any other identity. Also, Clark always did a good job combing away that spit curl.
Action Comics #858-863 and #866-870:
Writer Geoff Johns and artist Gary Frank took Action Comics to new heights. Johns, of course, is known for his 10-year run on Green Lantern, which rose Hal Jordan to the status of a DC Comics heavy hitter — up there with Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. So you can imagine the magic he works with the Man of Steel. Frank draws a riveting all-world Superman that is clearly influenced by Christopher Reeve. These two-story arcs involve the Legion of Superheroes and Brainiac. Superman: Secret Origin #1-6 (2009-10):
The aforementioned Johns and Frank take on a new origin for Superman pre-New 52. [’SUPERMAN UNCHAINED’: Writer Scott Snyder on taking over Supes: ‘It’s a huge honor and it’s really scary’]
All Star Superman #1-12 (2006-08):
Grant Morrison writes one of the most distinctive Superman stories ever — told in a tale set outside of DC Comics continuity, and in which Superman has only one year to live. Frank Quitely provides art that seems like the perfect fit for Morrison's words. Trinity #1-3 (2003):
Matt Wagner writes and draws this tale of the first meeting among DC Comics’ big three of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. Justice League #1-6 (2011):
If there is a Superman designed to coincide with Henry Cavill's Kal-El, it's this one. Don't believe us? Look: No red trunks. This new Justice League is a part of DC Comics’s New 52.
Kingdom Come #1-4 (1996):
What happens when in the future, a new generation of superheroes is out of control? Superman is reluctantly forced to come out of retirement to try to make things right after his years-long absence has clearly had an effect on the world. Mark Waid writes a true classic here. With art by Alex Ross — who has the uncanny ability to render superheroes the way you think they would look in real life — this is a story that’s still an incredible read almost 20 years later.
[ANN HORNADAY: Post’s film critic on ‘Man of Steel’ (1-1/2 stars)]
Superman Birthright #1-12 (2003-04):
If there's a story that can be said to have influenced the "Man of Steel" movie, it's this one. Waid writes yet another definitive Superman tale, showing the struggles Jor-El had sending his only son to an unknown future — and a young Clark Kent, traveling the world trying to figure out his destiny. This one packs an emotional ending.
Superman for All Seasons #1-4 (1998):
When writer Jeph Loeb and artist Tim Sale team on a project — no matter who the hero — it's worth the read.
. Superman: Red Son #1-3 (2003):
Writer Mark Miller provocatively poses the question: What would happen if Kal-El's rocket landed on a Ukrainian farm during the Cold War ‘50s?

Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Correction:
The article misstated the date of a meeting between the university’s president, Wallace D. Loh, and conference officials. Based on information from Loh, the article said the meeting was Nov. 8; it actually took place Nov. 4. This version has been corrected.
U-Md. president: Big Ten move deliberate
Video: The Post Sports Live crew offers ACC and Big Ten perspectives on the University of Maryland’s decision to accept the offer to join the Big Ten conference starting in 2014.
By Jenna Johnson, E-mail the writer
University of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh said his decision to move the school to the Big Ten Conference came after nearly two months of research and input from more than two dozen school officials, politicians, prominent alumni and donors, challenging critics who have characterized the move as hasty and cloaked in secrecy.
Loh said a team of consultants, attorneys and financial analysts fully vetted projected revenue data that Big Ten officials provided. Loh said there were several times that he thought the deal would fall through, and he said he was always willing to walk away.

Milestones in Maryland’s ACC history: For nearly 60 years, the athletic teams of the University of Maryland have competed in the Atlantic Coast Conference. But beginning with the 2014-15 school year, the Terrapins will compete in the Big Ten conference. Here is a look at the school’s athletic history. Video
Students are shocked after university President Dr. Wallace D. Loh announced Monday that the Terrapins will join the Big Ten in 2014. After nearly 60 years, Maryland will leave the Atlantic Coast Conference , a conference it helped establish. But there was an ever-growing list of reasons why Loh wanted it to work. At the top of the list: Joining the Big Ten would likely bring millions of extra dollars to the school’s struggling athletic department, which has been operating at a deficit and this year announced it would cut entire sports from the program.In an interview in College Park on Monday, Loh said he has always known that a conference jump would upset fans who were loyal to the Atlantic Coast Conference, a league that U-Md. helped create nearly 60 years ago.“The ACC is a strong conference. We are a proud member,” said Loh, who was previously provost at the University of Iowa, a Big Ten school. “There is no reason for us to leave. So if we are going to consider, seriously, leaving, it has got to be worth our while.” When news of the move became official last week, many students, coaches, faculty, alumni and others were stunned, and some questioned why they were not consulted. The president said he involved as many constituencies as allowed under a strict Big Ten confidentiality agreement he signed at the outset of discussions in early October. University System of Maryland Regent C. Thomas McMillen, who cast the lone vote against endorsing the school’s Big Ten application, has publicly challenged the way in which the decision was made.The Big Ten “wanted Maryland two years ago, and it will want Maryland tomorrow,” McMillen wrote in an opinion piece published in The Washington Post on Sunday. “The real problem is that commissioners of athletic conferences can dictate terms to universities that effectively hijack the possibility of debate, and that is just plain wrong.”Loh said neither he nor the Big Ten ever imposed a deadline, but as information began to leak out about a possible deal in mid-November, he and Big Ten officials decided it was best to forge ahead quickly.“I believe this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” Loh said. “If we don’t join now, I don’t think Maryland will ever join in my lifetime.” It all started in early October, when Loh said Big Ten officials asked to meet. Loh and two top athletic department officials flew to Chicago for a presentation. Loh said he was “stunned” by the historically Midwestern league’s projected revenues and plans to expand beyond its current 12 schools.Back in College Park, Loh shared what he learned with senior staff members — nearly all of whom Loh said were “absolutely incredulous” about the idea. But after a week of thinking about it, Loh said they began to see how it could benefit the university.“I said: ‘If we can negotiate something that will guarantee the future of Maryland athletics for at least an entire generation, for 50 years, then we should consider it seriously,’ ” Loh said.Loh also won the support of his predecessor, William E. “Brit” Kirwan, who is now the chancellor of the University System of Maryland.A team of consultants, financial analysts and lawyers “scrubbed” the Big Ten’s projected numbers, Loh said. He also built a “coalition” of major donors, politicians and famous alumni, earning their blessings. Loh also called up presidents at other schools, especially those who had recently changed conferences. What Loh said he repeatedly heard: These changes happen quickly and quietly, and the blowback from fans could be brutal.After a month passed with no word back from the Big Ten, officials called and requested another meeting. On Nov. 4, Loh and other university officials met with Big Ten officials at a Washington hotel for seven hours without reaching agreement, he said.Loh estimates that by mid-November, a few hundred people connected to the Big Ten and U-Md. had some inkling of the negotiations. He said each side became worried when news of a potential deal began to appear on the Internet. Things sped up.“I knew these rumors could kill the deal,” Loh said. “It could kill it before we even reach a deal.”By Nov. 16, Loh didn’t think they would ever reach an agreement. The next morning, Loh hosted a Saturday pregame event at his home before the Terrapins hosted ACC foe Florida State at Byrd Stadium. During the party, Loh and a few other officials spoke by phone with the Big Ten. At 10:45 a.m. they reached an agreement.The next day, Loh signed the paperwork, with the provision that it would only become official with the endorsement of the university’s governing board. The board voted to approve the move on Monday morning, in a secret meeting in Baltimore. The Big Ten Council of Presidents and Chancellors unanimously followed suit, and the move was announced in College Park later that day. Sure enough, there was emotional blowback, as Loh had been warned. But he hopes it is something that will subside over time. “Your typical fan is looking at it only in terms of today and the game with Duke in January,” Loh said. “It’s not their job to look at the broader picture of where the university is going over the next 10 to 20 years. That is my job.” Read more college sports

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Missouri executes Joseph Paul Franklin with controversial drug pentobarbital
Serial killer Joseph Franklin, a white supremacist and the man who shot Hustler Magazine founder Larry Flynt, was executed by lethal injection Wednesday after the Supreme Court denied his appeal.
Written by
Max Ehrenfreund
E-mail the writer
Joseph Paul Franklin, the white supremacist who claimed responsibility for as many as 20 murders committed in several states between 1977 and 1980, was executed Wednesday morning in a Missouri prison. His execution had been delayed for six hours after district court judges stayed the execution on Tuesday. The two stays were later overturned.
Franklin was put to death for the murder of Gerald Gordon outside a synagogue near St. Louis in 1977, the only one of his many crimes that carried the death penalty:
Franklin, a paranoid schizophrenic, was in his mid-20s when he began drifting across the country. He bombed a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tenn., in July 1977. No one was hurt, but soon, the killings began.He arrived in the St. Louis area in October 1977 and picked out the Brith Sholom Kneseth Israel synagogue from the Yellow Pages. He fired five shots at the parking lot in Richmond Heights after a bar mitzvah on Oct. 8, 1977. One struck and killed Gerald Gordon, a 42-year-old father of three.Franklin got away. His killing spree continued another three years.Several of his victims were interracial couples. He also shot and killed, among others, two black children in Cincinnati, three female hitchhikers and a white 15-year-old prostitute, with whom he was angry because the girl had sex with black men.He finally stumbled after killing two young black men in Salt Lake City in August 1980. He was arrested a month later in Kentucky, briefly escaped, and was captured for good a month after that in Florida.Franklin was convicted of eight murders: two in Madison, Wis., two in Cincinnati, two in Salt Lake City, one in Chattanooga, Tenn., and the one in St. Louis County. Years later, in federal prison, Franklin admitted to several crimes, including the St. Louis County killing. He was sentenced to death in 1997.
Associated Press
Franklin declined to make a final statement, but told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Monday that he was sorry for his crimes and that he no longer harbored hatred for Jews and blacks.
Franklin was the first person executed in Missouri in three years and the first to be put to death in the state with pentobarbital. The drug has been in short supply in U.S. prisons since its Danish manufacturer restricted shipments in 2011. The manufacturer and human-rights groups have said that executions are a misuse of the drug. Franklin’s dose was prepared by a compounding pharmacy.
