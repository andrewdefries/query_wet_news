Redskins-Seahawks best and worst
By Dan Steinberg
(Jonathan Ferrey - GETTY IMAGES)
Best and worst moments from the Redskins’ 23-17 win over the Seahawks in Seattle.
Best Defensive Moment: The Redskins went with another all-out blitz on the Seahawks’ crucial 4th-down play just before the 2-minute warning, and this time it led to a crush of burgundy around the quarterback, and a sack, and a win. We all hammered Jim Haslett when it failed against Dallas, so credit to the defensive coordinator when it works.
Best Swag: Rex Grossman will throw horrible interceptions into triple coverage, fling a feeble intentional grounding attempt to nowhere, catch a tipped ball and try to throw it again, and do all the other Bad Rex things he does. But then he’ll go ahead and air out a perfect game-winning 50-yard touchdown pass on 3rd-and-19, and leap into the air in celebration. It’s an experience, anyhow. Which leads me to...
Best Quarterback on the Roster: Is there any doubt it’s Grossman? And that starting John Beck for three games was a total waste of time and momentum during one of the NFC East’s weakest years in recent memory? Beck’s three starts produced 31 points and 857 net yards. Grossman came in and produced 57 points and 1015 net yards in three games, with largely the same personnel. I don’t believe this team would be 4-7 had Grossman started all 11 games.
Best Running Back on This Roster: Is there any doubt that it’s Roy Helu Jr.? Ever since Tim Hightower went out for the season, fans have been calling for Helu to take the lead role. Sunday, it finally happened, and the rookie responded with 162 all-purpose yards. He touched the ball on 11 of Washington’s first 20 plays, reached a career high in carries before halftime, and had one of the team’s best offensive plays of the season when he hurdled a defender and went for a 28-yard touchdown. Dunno why it took so long, though. Five times this season a Redskins RB has gone over 100 all-purpose yards; Helu’s responsible for three of ’em.
Worst Field Goal Operation: The Redskins have now failed on 20 field-goal attempts over their past 27 games. That includes four blocks this year, which leads the NFL. Graham Gano also had an extra point blocked and put the subsequent kickoff out of bounds. It’s been fun.
Worst Turnover Streak: Twenty-five games and counting for the Redskins, the longest streak in the NFL. The first Rex interception was just sort of average, but the second one was classic, triple-covered and underthrown and immediately following a Seattle missed field goal.
(Ted S. Warren - AP)
Best Opening Drive: Clearly, Sunday’s first drive was Washington’s best first drive of the season, and maybe best drive, period. It went 14 plays and 80 yards, took nearly eight minutes, actually included both runs and passes, and wound up in the end zone. It was the first time the Redskins scored a touchdowns on their first drive in 15 games, and only the second time this season they got any points on their first drive. Washington ended the first quarter with 12:23 time of possession and a 10-1 advantage in first downs.. Worst Line: “Helu will have to dance. He’s not even close to the dance floor,” Fox’s Ron Pitts said at one point. Later, Jim Mora Jr. started talking about Kyle Schottenheimer, who doesn’t exist. Also, Pitts called a left-to-right field goal movement “a draw,” which makes no sense. The Redskins aren’t exactly drawing the A-team broadcasters lately.
Worst Broadcast: Ok, more on that. Maybe the game was a bit dull through three quarters, but nobody tuned in to see video of Mora coaching youth football, or old photos of Mora as a player, or anything else about Mora. It was a total mess of a broadcast.
Best Return: Santana Moss made an immediate difference in his return from injury; he was targeted three times in Washington’s first five plays, and converted an early third-down. The veteran finished with just 4 catches for 29 yards, but he absolutely changed the offense.
Best Return, II: In Washington’s first 10 games this season, Anthony Armstrong had 47 receiving yards and one touchdown. On one play Sunday, he had a 50-yard touchdown that put Washington in position for the win.
Worst Flag: The 44-yard pass interference call against Josh Wilson was ridiculous, and Mora let the officials have it. He also said there were 5 million furious people in Washington, D.C., which slightly overestimates the team’s television audience. In any case, that penalty gave the Seahawks three points and their first lead, although the Redskins were handed a ridiculous high-hit-to-the-QB call on their next drive. The officiating seemed spotty throughout.
Best Rivalry: Who knew? The teams skirmished during warm-ups, skirmished again during the coin toss, skirmished after an extra point, drew about 5,000 personal foul calls, and jawed at each other throughout the game. Rarely have two losing teams from opposite coasts and different divisions conferences displayed such raw and bloody late-November disdain. Popular theories for the hate included the teams vying for Washington supremacy, the Seahawks attempting to defend Jim Zorn’s honor, and the players kindly trying to distract us from Ron Pitts and Jim Mora. Worst Illegal Touching: Jabar Gaffney. No off-color jokes here, people. Gaffney stepping on the end line cost the Redskins a touchdown, and their subsequent field-goal attempt was blocked.
Worst Time Management: Everyone.
Best Addition to the Lineup: Since becoming a starter, Perry Riley has 34 28 tackles in three games. Plus he never seems to celebrate when the other team has gained a first down.
Worst Attempt to Throw Two Passes on One Play: Grossman is such a gunslinger that he will catch a batted ball and then just chuck it forward again, rules be damned.
Worst Tackling: LaRon Landry wins for one of his classic violent launching-missile seek-and-destroy kill shots in which the ball carrier doesn’t fall down and is allowed to keep running after contact. That’s not an effective defensive strategy.
Best Stat: Sav Rocca had his first touchback of the season Sunday, in his 11th game of the season. He’s also put 21 punts inside the 20. That is a remarkable season, and makes Rocca the best Redskins punter in a generation.
Best Standings: A million things have gone wrong this season, and many fans still doubt the direction of the future, but it’s 11 weeks in, and the Redskins are tied with the Dream Team. It’s bad, but it could be worse.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
A user’s guide for the Beltway express lanes
Tracy A. Woodward/THE WASHINGTON POST - Southbound Express lanes are seen next to the outer loop of the Beltway.

By Robert Thomson, E-mail the writer
This is your code book for cracking the mysteries of the 495 Express Lanes, the biggest new thing in the D.C. region’s transportation system in decades.
They are a little like HOV lanes and a little like Maryland’s Intercounty Connector, but not enough like either for drivers to get by without some prep work. Even familiarity with the Capital Beltway will get them only so far in anticipating the express-lanes experience.
Graphic
Beltway drivers can use 495 Express Lanes when the new lanes open this fall. Among the many questions commuters ask as they consider a test drive this coming week, these are the essentials.
What are the 495 Express Lanes? Generically, they are know as high-occupancy toll, or HOT lanes. A private consortium picked up most of the cost to build them in exchange for the right to collect tolls.Some drivers will pay a variable toll to use them. Motorcyclists will ride free. Drivers who assemble a carpool of three or more also can ride free. Buses ride free, too, creating an incentive for transit services. There’s no exemption for hybrids. These rules will be in effect around the clock and every day of the year. Where are they? These four new lanes are in the middle of the Beltway between Springfield and just north of the Dulles Toll Road. That’s 14 miles from end to end. There are two lanes in each direction. They are separated from the Beltway’s regular lanes by white bollards set eight feet apart. Only at the ends can drivers slide in and out of the express lanes. The other access points are at interchanges.
What makes them different? The public-private partnership is an unusual way to finance public infrastructure. But for commuters, the essential difference is the tolling system.The tolls will be used to manage traffic flow and guarantee a reliable trip. When the lanes are lightly used, the tolls will be low. As the lanes get more crowded, the tolls will rise. Some Beltway drivers will see those higher tolls appear on signs near the access points and decide it’s too pricey, so they’ll stick with the regular lanes.The tolls will keep rising to ensure that the remaining users of the lanes are driving at least 45 mph.
What’s the toll, really? This is the most frequently asked question of all. Dynamic tolling is a new concept for the D.C. region’s drivers. They don’t like paying tolls, and they especially don’t like paying tolls that can change frequently based on sensors feeding traffic-flow data to computers. The lane operators say they expect the toll at quiet times could be about 20 cents a mile, rising to about $1.25 per mile in some segments during rush hour.Most drivers won’t go the whole route. They will pay a total for the segments they use. Some segments may be more congested than others. The operators estimate the average cost of a trip at $1 or $2 off-peak and $3 to $6 during rush hours.
Will tolls rise while I’m driving? This isn’t like handing your teenager a cellphone and the next month staring at a $500 phone bill you didn’t see coming. Express lanes drivers will know the maximum toll up front, at the point where they are deciding whether to use the lanes.The toll rate will be locked in when they pass under the first toll gantry at the start of the trip and won’t rise or fall for them while they are in the lanes.
What signs am I looking for? When approaching access points, look for the purple and white “E-ZPass” sign followed by “EXPRESS” in black letters. Under some of those signs, drivers will see blocks of black type that state the rules on who pays tolls and who doesn’t.Below the E-ZPass EXPRESS banner on other signs, drivers will see a message board displaying three tolls. The first two will be current tolls to popular destinations. The bottom line will be the toll all the way to the end of the express lanes.Preparing to leave the lanes, drivers should look for signs that say “E-ZPass EXPRESS EXIT.” There’s almost always an orange and black sign nearby that says “LEFT EXIT.”
Do I need an E-ZPass? Yes, unless you are riding a motorcycle. If you already have an E-ZPass and don’t plan on carpooling, you are all set. If you want to form a three-person carpool for a free ride, get a new type of transponder called an E-ZPass Flex. The Flex has a switch. In one setting, it’s a regular E-ZPass and allows the electronic readers to assess the toll. The other setting — announced by a beep as you toggle the switch — tells the reader that you are claiming the carpool exemption.
How do I get one? In Virginia, drivers can apply online at www.ezpassva.com. They also can apply at one of the state’s E-ZPass Service Centers or call 877-762-7824. Virginia charges a monthly fee of 50 cents for the standard transponder. New customers must prepay $35 in tolls. Starting in January, the Flex fee will be $1 a month. It will be waived for drivers who use it regularly in the carpool setting.Maryland’s E-ZPass program offers the Flex as well as the regular transponder, but the rules are different. Maryland offers three options for buying the Flex: Go to the Maryland program’s Web site at www.ezpassmd.com, call 888-321-6824 or stop by any E-ZPass Maryland Center.
What if I use the lanes without one? Then you didn’t pay your toll. You can go to 495ExpressLanes.com and click on “Missed Toll?” to pay online. In addition to the toll that was in effect at the time you drove, there will be a $1.50 administrative fee. If you don’t pay online, you will get a letter assessing the toll and adding a fee of $12.50. If a driver ignores toll notices, the information will be turned over to a debt collector.
Enforcement? State police will patrol the lanes. They have spots near toll gantries they can stop and monitor compliance with the toll rules. They receive a signal when a nearby driver is using the E-ZPass Flex to claim the carpool exemption. They can count.

Sibling rivalry not fit for a King
Video: A generation after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s death, his children are locked in a fight over control of the civil rights leader's legacy, involving two of his most cherished possessions: his Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Bible carried.
By Eugene Robinson, E-mail the writer
Nothing will ever tarnish the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who transformed a nation. But his squabbling heirs seem to be trying their best.
I realize these are harsh words for a family that has suffered more than most. But King’s sons and daughter need to be reminded — yet again — that their father’s words and deeds belong not just to his descendants but to history as well. The King siblings have a responsibility not to treat this precious inheritance like some shiny knickknack someone found in the attic.

Putin’s folly
In the latest round of internecine warfare, Martin Luther King III and Dexter King have filed a lawsuit seeking to compel their sister, Bernice King, to hand over their father’s Nobel Peace Prize medal, which he received in 1964, and the Bible he carried with him whenever he traveled. The suit claims that Bernice King has “secreted and sequestered” these objects in violation of a 1995 agreement that the entire inheritance would be held by an entity called the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., which the brothers control.The suit, which was filed in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta, came to light this week when Bernice King issued a blistering statement accusing her brothers of wanting to sell “our father’s most prized possessions” to a “private buyer.” The lawsuit makes no mention of any planned sale, and the brothers have thus far declined to comment. While Dexter King and Martin Luther King III control their father’s estate, Bernice King is chief executive of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. Both the King Estate and the King Center claim the right and responsibility to safeguard the King legacy.“My brothers’ decision to sue me is drastic and grieves me greatly,” Bernice King said in her statement. “I have absolutely no desire to be in court or to fight yet another public battle.”“Yet another” is correct: This is by no means the first time the siblings have taken their squabbling to court.In 2008, Bernice and Martin joined forces to sue Dexter for allegedly misusing or wasting funds from the King Estate. Dexter sued Bernice and Martin, claiming that they had misused assets belonging to the King Center, including a $55,000 Lincoln Navigator given to the center that he claimed Martin had converted to personal use. Those suits were eventually settled out of court, sparing the siblings the indignity of a circus-like trial.
Last August, Dexter and Martin sued in an attempt to remove Bernice as head of the King Center, even threatening to withdraw legal permission for the center to use King’s name and likeness. Now comes the new lawsuit that prompted Bernice’s angry reply. My guess is that eventually we’ll see a new settlement, a new reconciliation and a new pledge to move forward in harmony — until the next ugly episode.If I were the judge hearing the latest suit, I would order all three of the siblings to take a moment to reflect on the two “sacred items” presently at issue.They wouldn’t get very far into King’s well-worn Bible before coming across the archetypal story of sibling rivalry: Cain and Abel. They would be reminded that by slaying his brother, Cain brought eternal misery and woe upon himself — and that, yes, each of us is our brother’s keeper.And if the three Kings would examine the Nobel medal, hold it in their hands, feel its weight, consider its meaning, they would surely be reminded that their father’s dream was one of harmony and brotherhood. Fighting bitterly over an award dedicated to peace serves only to mock their father’s legacy, not honor it.I’m actually sympathetic toward the King siblings. In effect, their father was taken from them twice — once by an assassin’s bullet and once by his canonization as one of the great figures in modern history. They have the burden of knowing it will be impossible to live up to their father’s legacy — and the burden of still having to try.What they need to understand is that their father didn’t climb to the mountaintop alone. He didn’t act as if he were entitled to anything, didn’t seek to silence those who disagreed with him, didn’t claim to know all the answers. In times of struggle and triumph, he sang “We Shall Overcome” — and reached out to those beside him, calling them brothers and sisters, to join hands.
