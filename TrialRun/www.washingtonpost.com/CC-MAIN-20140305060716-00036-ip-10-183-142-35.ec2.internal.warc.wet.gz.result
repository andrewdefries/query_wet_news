The sign in front of Bryce Harper’s locker
By Dan Steinberg
After the Nats mashed the Rockies yet again Wednesday night, there was plenty of time for joyous frivolity in the team’s clubhouse.
And thus, there were tweets like this, from Adam Kilgore:
In Bryce Harper’s locker, there were two neon yellow posterboard signs: “This is a clown question, bro: Will you marry me Bryce?”
And like this, from Amanda Comak:
Harper said he probably wasn’t going to say yes. But he certainly got a kick out of the gesture. Because everything in the world is now on the Internet, and because this chap named @RecordsAndRadio somehow finds it all, here’s an image of that sign.
The person who posted the image also sent this tweet to the Nats’ official account: “look at my friends sign!! The guys in the bullpen took her number! We expect a call!
And this one, to Tyler Clippard: “hey we hope that you give bryce her number!!!”

PHOTOS| Le Diplomate Alex von Tunzelmann’s “Red Heat,” on Cold War in the Caribbean
By David Hoffman, E-mail the writer
Power in the Caribbean in the 1950s and early ’60s was taken by a knife at the throat. “Political life in Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic was a cockfight,” writes Alex von Tunzelmann. “For any politician landing in the dust, the only thing that mattered was to survive for as long as possible.” Her book “Red Heat” depicts the swaggering, corrupt, erratic and often violent years of rule by Fidel Castro of Cuba, Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic and Francois Duvalier of Haiti. Suitcases full of cash, torture chambers, gunboats, coups, dictatorship and revolutionary fervor spill out of these pages.
The story would be action-packed enough on its own, but as von Tunzelmann shows, the region was also buffeted by the Cold War, transformed into an arena of mistrust and dangerous gambles, the largest of which was the Cuban missile crisis. The author is particularly critical of diplomats, spies and others in the United States who, in the Eisenhower and Kennedy years, failed to grasp the essence of various strains of nationalism and anti-Americanism in the region, and instead labeled it all communism.
‘Red Heat: Conspiracy, Murder, and the Cold War in the Caribbean’ by Alex Von Tunzelmann (Henry Holt. 449 pp. $30)

Free admission Get ideas The ruthlessness of Trujillo and Duvalier is mind-numbing. Von Tunzelmann concludes that their regimes were “among the most kleptocratic, sadistic, repressive, and murderous in the entire twentieth century.” But the author sets Castro apart. “From any point of view, Castro’s Cuba was less murderous, less violent, less corrupt, more economically and socially egalitarian, immensely healthier and better educated, and less racist than either Duvalier’s regime or Trujillo’s.” She finds in the younger Castro “a patriot, a man with a profound sense that it was his mission to save the Cuban people.” His first manifesto, in 1956, had “nothing in it that marked any development toward communism, or even socialism.” The 1957 manifesto of Sierra Maestra “was marginally left of center, but a long way from being communist.” His brother Raul and Che Guevara certainly were communists, but Castro was more of a charismatic nationalist and opportunist. His small band of revolutionaries plucked power from the corrupt dictator Fugencio Batista in 1958. “Our revolution is neither capitalist nor communist!” Castro insisted the following May. “Our revolution is not red, but olive green.” Von Tunzelmann, whose earlier work, “Indian Summer,” chronicled the British transfer of power to India and Pakistan, spots the larger forces at work and identifies the point in 1959 when Castro shifted toward Moscow. She concludes he was motivated not by ideology but pragmatism, to counter-balance the United States. “Since the day of his victory, he had been dancing around Uncle Sam: one minute whispering private entreaties, the next slinging public insults.” Castro was “unpredictable, fiercely puritanical, and controlling,” the author writes, but “not the crackpot that many in the United States government assumed he was.” To support his own narrative as the liberator of Cuba, she writes, “Fidel needed a villain willing to persecute him until the bitter end. Into that role, quite unwittingly, stepped the United States.” In the next two years, Cuba formally allied itself with the Soviet Union, John F. Kennedy was elected president, and the CIA came up with imaginative ways to assassinate Castro, including a cigar death trap, with the leaves soaked in botulinum toxin. In 1961, at the outset of Kennedy’s term, the CIA launched the ill-fated invasion at the Bay of Pigs. The author says the invasion attempt led directly to a deepening Soviet involvement in Cuba. Enter Nikita Khrushchev, who, “Like the fragile lizard that puffs out a frill to scare off predators,” had a habit of exaggerating Soviet strategic weaponry in order to keep the United States off guard. He came up with the idea to secretly deploy nuclear weapons to Cuba, perhaps to defend the island against a U.S. invasion, but also to huff and puff. The discovery of the weaponsby the United States led to the most harrowing crisis of the nuclear age. Von Tunzelmann claims that the missile crisis “was provoked by a band of bearded guerrillas, mostly in their twenties and early thirties,” but that seems an overstatement. The book shows that it was Khrushchev who proposed to Castro that the missiles be sent. And when the Soviet leader decided to back down, he did so hastily, without informing the bearded guerrillas until later.Von Tunzelmann packs a lot into these pages, sometimes more than a reader can absorb, including a flock of minor characters. Much of her tale has previously been told elsewhere. The storytelling carries a distinct, admonishing voice, disdainful of the errors made by the United States, outraged by the brutality of the island bosses. The author is also harsh on Kennedy. But she captures the missile crisis as a frightening and real dance of knives in a dusty Caribbean cockfighting square.

By Daniel Fromson, E-mail the writer
Imagine it’s 2013, and you want to visit a brewery in the District. Will you try the nanobrewery whose single employee brews only a few beers, all of them German-style, or the monolithic brewery-restaurant hybrid across town, with 15 constantly rotating house beers on tap and 100 seats on the patio alone? What about the cozy new brewpub ensconced in a historic storefront, with its experimental farmhouse ales? Or maybe the latest large brewery to spring up in Northeast, which sets itself apart with an eclectic blend of European and American flavors?
If all goes according to plan, those four establishments will open in the District within the next year or so, complementing DC Brau, Chocolate City Beer and 3 Stars Brewing, the three that emerged last year. Welcome to the second wave of the capital’s brewing revival, an influx of breweries that will reshape the local beer scene largely because of their unprecedented diversity.
At one end of the size spectrum is Low Brau, the nanobrewery founded by design-industry professional and home-brewer Steven Sorrell, who is scouting brewery sites around Fort Totten and Brookland and hopes his tiny, two-barrel brewhouse will be operational by this summer. Sorrell grew up in Germany and, accordingly, intends to carve out a niche by focusing on refreshing German wheat beers, the sort of stuff you can imagine sipping on a porch during the summer, as he puts it.“Even though there’s wheat beers here, they’re not the same — they don’t have that same characteristic as the ones in Germany,” he says. “The ones in Germany are smooth and clean.” With his flagship beer, Heidi Weiss, Sorrell will replicate the fruity-spicy banana and clove aromas characteristic of Bavarian weissbiers. He also plans to launch a stronger wheat beer called Totten Bock and, eventually, a pilsener and possibly a version of the German hard cider known as apfelwein.If Low Brau represents one extreme, the still-unnamed brewery project from Neighborhood Restaurant Group, which will probably open about a year from now near Nationals Park, embodies the other. A bold combination of brewery, brewpub and 200-plus-seat restaurant overseen by Birch & Barley/ChurchKey executive chef Kyle Bailey, it will, in the words of NRG beer director Greg Engert, “resist definition.” He says that in addition to the approximately 15 house beers on draft, there will always be several beers on tap from other breweries, as well as about five casks and a bottle list.“We’re really looking at it as bringing the restaurant ideals of service and craftsmanship in the kitchen and marrying that with the service and craftsmanship of the beer itself,” Engert says. It will be almost like having “two kitchens sitting side by side”: NRG intends to have a pantry that will be used by both cooks and brewers, filled with locally foraged herbs, spices and other ingredients.As for the beers themselves, Engert envisions constant experimentation and an ambitious barrel-aging and sour-beer program. He also says the brewery will team up with renowned brewers around the country to brew collaboration beers, which will help form the basis of the brewery’s distribution strategy. NRG wants to send its beer — mostly kegs and limited runs of 750-milliliter bottles — nationwide almost immediately.For sheer hipness, though, it might be hard for NRG to top the brewpub whose working name is “Right, Proper”: a partnership between Thor Cheston, formerly of Pizzeria Paradiso and Brasserie Beck, and Nathan Zeender, a home-brewer with a knack for dry, yeasty Belgian-inspired ales and barrel-aged sour beers reminiscent of Belgian lambics.Whereas NRG’s brewery will have a modern, glass-filled aesthetic and undoubtedly will be swamped by stadium-goers, Cheston and Zeender are aiming for an intimate neighborhood vibe inspired by the Baltimore brewpub Brewer’s Art. “Both myself and Thor have a pretty overdeveloped sense of place,” Zeender says, adding that they’ve been looking at historic buildings in and around the Shaw neighborhood of Northwest. The beers, too, will have a “revivalist” feel, gesturing to numerous global traditions. Before the tentative opening date — a year or more from now — Zeender hopes to bulk up his recipe book by interning at breweries in Belgium, Scandinavia and Quebec and throughout the United States.Of the four new brewing ventures, the one that most closely resembles what D.C. residents have already seen is Hellbender Brewing, which initially will focus on placing kegs in local bars, as DC Brau, Chocolate City and 3 Stars have done. Founder Ben Evans hopes to open by this summer and eventually sell cans to retailers, too.Still, Evans, a microbiology researcher who is overseeing Hellbender with congressional staffer Patrick Mullane, says his offerings won’t taste much like the competition’s. “For instance,” he says, “rather than coming out with a pale ale, we decided to come out with a Kolsch,” a hoppy, gold-colored German ale. “I’ve been working on that for many years, and we thought that would be a more unique addition to our lineup.”In the D.C. brewing world, that kind of thinking is now business as usual: Be good — but, maybe more important, be different.

D.C. spending plan cuts programs and staff at dozens of schools
By Emma Brown and Tim Craig, E-mail the writers
When D.C. Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson announced in January that she wanted to close 15 schools, she said the downsizing would help create a stronger school system with rich academic offerings, a system that could compete with the city’s charter schools.
But Henderson’s proposed fiscal 2014 budget has raised concerns about her ability to fulfill that promise. The $818 million spending plan, an increase of less than 1 percent from this year’s budget, calls for some new investments, but it requires cuts to staff and programs at dozens of schools, including some where enrollment is holding steady or rising.

Henderson faced skepticism Thursday when she testified before the D.C. Council’s Education Committee. Committee members blasted the spending cuts and expressed concern that they could cripple efforts to persuade parents to send their children to the city’s traditional public schools.Henderson told the committee that she has little choice but to shift resources because of the system’s failure to meet enrollment projections. The system received per-pupil funding this year for a projected enrollment of about 47,000 students, but only 45,500 showed up. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) has said he was obligated to use a more realistic number for next year: 46,060.“We would have to take the money from somewhere else,” Henderson told the committee. “We are doing the best we can with the hand we were dealt.”
Parents and politicians say the reductions threaten families’ faith in the school system, particularly in nonselective high schools and middle schools, many of which are facing deep cuts. At Stuart-Hobson Middle School on Capitol Hill, where enrollment is projected to rise but the budget would be sliced by 12 percent, students would be able to take a foreign language only if parents raised enough money to hire an after-school teacher.“The message that [D.C. Public Schools] sends to families looking for anything other than the bare minimum is, ‘Go to charters,’ ” said Laura Marks, a PTA member at Watkins Elementary, which is a feeder school for Stuart-Hobson. “It’s like DCPS has given up the game at middle school. They’re just walking away from it.”Council member David A. Catania (I-At Large), chairman of the Education Committee, said Henderson and Gray should have done more to reallocate resources so that no school experiences a cut of more than 5 percent. Catania said several schools — including Eliot-Hine Middle School, Ballou Senior High School and Stuart-Hobson — are looking at cuts of at least 10 percent.“You are left to defend a budget that in many ways is indefensible,” Catania told Henderson. “The responsibility of this budget rests with the mayor.”Council member Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), who, like Catania, is considering challenging Gray in next year’s mayoral election, said the school budget is unacceptable. Wells said many of the proposed cuts would hit schools on Capitol Hill, which he represents. “The greatest cuts have been in the schools that we’ve had the greatest challenge getting the parents of Washington D.C. to trust them,” Wells said. “I am very concerned you will not be able to convince parents to stay in DCPS at the middle school level with this budget,” Wells said.Also Thursday, Catania clashed with Henderson over funding for summer school after it was disclosed this week that the city plans to switch to invitation-only enrollment because of limited resources. That could leave hundreds of low-performing students out of the picture.Henderson said the new approach, which allows for 2,700 summer school slots, is needed because only $2.3 million is budgeted this year. Catania said he plans to ask Gray to use part of the city’s $400 million fiscal 2013 surplus to expand eligibility for summer school. “It just seems we need a more robust, targeted, thoughtful use of summer school,” he said. “We have a whole bunch of young people who simply cascade through the system until they hit the point of failure.”Henderson said that the budget includes a $7 million increase for 2014 and that 90 schools — about 82 percent of the system — will see an increase in funding. She said the budget also includes money to boost literacy and to guarantee that every elementary school student has “exposure” to art, music, physical education and a foreign language each week. The system plans to hire 56 additional art, music, PE and foreign language teachers along with 28 additional social workers.“I believe that this budget is well built to help us achieve the ambitious goals that we set for ourselves,” Henderson said. Parents say that individual school enrollment estimates seem unfairly low and that the low projections lead to program cuts, which drive families away. “Not investing in neighborhood schools where enrollment is low is a self-fulfilling prophecy,” said Jim Sullivan of Logan Circle, one of dozens of parents and activists who aired their concerns about the school budget during a council hearing last month.Council members have appeared sympathetic to that argument and have signaled an interest in restoring some of the cuts, although it’s unclear where they would get the money to do so.
Catania has said he is interested in identifying unnecessary spending that can be redirected into a fund that would be used to stabilize budgets at schools with falling enrollment. Absent such a fund, Catania says, families can’t trust that schools will offer the same programs from one year to the next, and schools can’t serve the students left behind. Ballou, in Southeast Washington, is slated to lose more than 10 percent of its budget next year. But more than 700 students at the school will continue to face profound struggles: Truancy is rampant, 99 percent of students are poor, more than a third have disabilities and fewer than a quarter are proficient in reading and math.“We do want money to some extent to follow the children,” Catania said in a hearing last month. “But we also need stable schools, and the two are not mutually exclusive.”Henderson has argued, in a recent Washington Post op-ed and in budget documents, that the school system is investing in important but little-seen improvements, such as literacy instruction, staff training and access to arts, music, foreign language and physical education.The system is hiring more than 200 teachers to eliminate mixed-grade classes and is investing $12 million in efforts to boost literacy. The money will be used to bolster curriculum citywide, extend the school day at nine low-performing schools and hire reading specialists and literacy-focused assistant principals at 11 schools.For the first time, all elementary schools will be required to offer 45 minutes a week of art, music, physical education and world language, an approach intended to ensure equitable opportunities. But schools also have much less power to tailor spending to community needs, a change that has been unpopular among principals and parents.“My kids don’t need to learn French. They need to learn to read and write on grade level in English,” said the principal of a school with a high percentage of struggling students, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Some council members have expressed concern about curtailing principals’ flexibility. Schools spokeswoman Melissa Salmanowitz said that D.C. principals still have great latitude to choose their staff, but the new scheduling requirements were necessary “to ensure some consistency across the district.”The requirement to offer all four special subjects comes with a catch: Dozens of schools won’t receive extra resources to meet the mandate. Some schools that currently have a full-time art teacher, for example, will have to downgrade that position to a part-time role to be able to hire a foreign-language teacher.Overall spending on art and music is falling from $20 million to $18.3 million, according to budget documents. But the school system is more than doubling its investment in foreign language, from $5.4 million this fiscal year to $11.4 million next year.The school system also plans to spend more on librarians, addressing long-standing complaints about the more than 50 schools that have no librarian. Nearly every school will have at least part-time librarian coverage next year. But to help pay for that increase, more than two dozen schools that currently have a full-time librarian will see that position reduced to half-time.Activist Peter MacPherson, who is among the most vocal critics of school policies under Gray and Henderson, has called on the mayor to dip into the $1.6 billion in combined surplus funding to make sure that every school has a full-time librarian and books on the shelves.“For those of us who have been advocating on this issue for more than year, what the chancellor has put forward thus on this issue is nothing but an affront,” MacPherson wrote in an e-mail to Gray. “I’m telling you that a wide swath of the school stakeholder community is deeply unhappy.”
