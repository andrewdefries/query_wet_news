Today's Top Five: Would You Rather...?
By Lindsay Applebaum
Lindsay Applebaum here, with some vaguely-sports-related links that will neither inspire nor educate you.
1) The worst "Would You Rather" ever for liberal Redskins fans. (Wall Street Journal)
2) Inside the Caps' glam rock music video shoot. (Puck Daddy) (And see also: OFB)
3) What have you done for the Redskins lately? (Hogs Haven)
4) The fall of two American renegades: Raiders Owner Al Davis vs. Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. (Bush League)
5) Video of Chris Rock
discussing Bill and Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, the Patriots and Michael Vick. (Gawker)
[Also, if you're so inclined: Steinberg's lengthy doubled-chinned blogterview with Washingtonian, Pete Kendall would like Redskins fans to shut the heck up, and Pacers fans are getting excited about Roy Hibbert.]

Chad Ochocinco begins tryout with MLS team
By Cindy Boren

Worlds collide. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chad Ochocinco has begun his tryout with MLS’s Sporting Kansas City team.
With NFL players locked out by their teams, Ochocinco is free to pursue soccer, a game he began playing when he was 4 but quit in high school.
With over 40 media members in attendance, Ochocinco spent much of the morning working with assistant coach Zoran Savic. He’s in KC on a four-day trial. (It’s still early, but photos seem to indicate he’s not going to make anyone forget Preki any time soon.)
His NFL coach, Marvin Lewis, expressed his displeasure with the move Tuesday at the NFL owners’ meeting in New Orleans.
#OCNN News: Tryout went well, about to head out with some of the guys. Thank you @SportingKC for the opportunity #ochofutbolless than a minute ago via RockLiveChad Ochocincoochocinco “How does he do at anything?” Lewis said. “What has he ever done that he's completed? What circle has he ever connected in any way?”
Ochocinco tweeted his response: “Marvin Lewis won't say anything bad about Carson Palmer stays kissing his [backside], but disses @ochocinco daily #smh.”

Limbaugh and Maher: Do these guys work with women?
By Erik Wemple
Maher: A guy’s guy?
(Janet Van Ham - HBO via Associated Press)
Rush Limbaugh used the terms “slut” and “prostitute” to slander a woman — Sandra Fluke — who spoke on Capitol Hill about contraceptives. Bill Maher used language about Sarah Palin that cannot be printed here. A small industry has sprung up to determine which of these men stakes a greater claim to Mass Media Misogynist of the Early ’10s. Let that debate continue — it’s an important one. Now for a neighboring consideration: Who lets these fellows get away with their offenses? After unleashing a misogynistic comment on air, do they have to walk past a female staffer or two on the way to the canteen? Let’s talk Maher first. He does a show on HBO called “Real Time.” A page on the HBO Web site inventories the show’s staffing. Here are the people on that page: Scott Carter, executive producer and writer; Brad Grey, executive producer; Sheila Griffiths, executive producer; Marc Gurvitz, executive producer; Bill Maher, executive producer and writer; Billy Martin, executive producer and writer; Dean Johnsen, co-executive producer; Matt Wood, producer; Mike Larsen, writer; Adam Felber, writer; Brian Jacobsmeyer, writer; Jay Jaroch, writer; Chris Kelly, writer; Paul Casey, director. Bold text was added to highlight the only apparent female on that staff list. Italicized text was added to highlight a guy whose bio includes this line: “Wearing the hats of both a producer and a writer — and they’re actual hats, one a simple ball cap and the other a pretentious derby — Billy arrives at the office early to get a jump on his work and to look at porn before the others arrive.”
Hold on a minute, though. HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer says that the Web site doesn’t properly reflect the level of gender diversity of “Real Time.” There are 25 staffers on the show, says Schaffer, and 10 of them are women. “Of those, there are segment producers, and all four of those are women,” says Schaffer, adding that three senior programming executives that oversee “Real Time” are women. Aha — a scandal within the scandal: HBO keeps women off the “Real Time” staff list on its Web site. Start drafting the class-action suit! (HBO is reportedly going to update the staff list very soon to reflect its more feminine side.) The spokesman further notes that Maher himself groomed executive producer Griffiths for a big role on his show. “He’s solely responsible for bringing her to the top,” says Schaffer. Did any of these numerous female staffers raise a ruckus after Maher last year referred to Palin as a “dumb [unprintable-in-The-Post word]”? Here’s the response from Schaffer: There are always women in the writers’ meetings and they openly share their thoughts or concerns on the material being discussed. At the end of the day, Bill has the ultimate say and balances those suggestions with how far he wants to push the edge with his comedic voice.
Not that women alone are capable of denouncing hatred of women; men can do that, too. Yet the more women in the conference room, as a rule, the less daylight for misogyny.
On one matter, at least, there is no equivalence whatsoever between Limbaugh and Maher, and that’s staff transparency. There doesn’t appear to be a staff page on the radio host’s Web site, and several experts consulted on this question say they haven’t seen one. Wikipedia has this list. It suggests that there aren’t many Las Rushbas in the domain of El Rushbo, but a source with the show says the list is not correct.
When asked for an authoritative accounting, Rachel Nelson of Premiere Radio Networks responded, “It’s our policy not to share personnel information.” Not that a list of, like, people who work on your show is bona fide personnel information. Keep that in mind the next time Limbaugh rants about government keeping secrets from the people.

A dazzling debut for Hagerstown’s Robbie Ray
By Dave Sheinin
Here is what Robbie Ray missed by spending the first five weeks of the minor league season at extended spring training in Florida, rather than at low Class A Hagerstown: He missed the Bryce Harper circus. He missed the Suns’ eight-game winning streak and their surge to the top record in the South Atlantic League. He missed a lot of 10-hour bus rides.
But here is what the Suns missed during those same five weeks: A 6-foot-2 lefty with a sneaky-fast 91- to 92-mph fastball, a filthy slider and a nice change-up. A fearless strike-thrower who works fast and who only mixes in a ball when he thinks it serves a greater purpose. A 19-year-old who looks like he’s been doing this forever.
Those impressions, mind you, were formed on the basis of just one outing. But what an outing it was. On Monday night, Ray made his professional starting debut for the Suns, pitching five shutout, one-hit innings against the Delmarva Shorebirds. He carried a no-hitter into the fifth, gave up a leadoff double — the only well-struck ball he gave up — then went ground out, strikeout, strikeout (his fifth and sixth of the night) to close out the inning, before departing due to a predetermined innings limit.
But here are some even more impressive numbers: Not only did Ray not walk a batter — he also never faced a three-ball count and never fell behind 2-0 in the count. He threw only 13 balls among his 59 pitches.
“He almost threw more pitches in the bullpen [during warm-ups] than he did in the game,” joked Hagerstown pitching coach Chris Michalak.
Ray’s slider was particularly impressive, and he used it after getting ahead to finish off the majority of his strikeouts. On his final strikeout of the night, he actually hit the batter in the midsection, but the poor guy (a right-handed batter) was fooled so badly he couldn’t stop his swing. I thought the pitch must have been a high slider, to have gotten so deep into the right-handed batter’s box (from the pressbox vantage point, and without benefit of a radar-gun readout, it was difficult to tell), but Ray said it was just a fastball, and figured the guy must have been looking for a change-up.
“The command of his fastball is what stood out,” said Hagerstown Manager Brian Daubach. “Even when he missed, he missed where he wanted to miss.”
(Incidentally, in 2009 Ray pitched for the 18-and-under U.S. national team that won the world championship. His catcher? Bryce Harper.)
It has been a particularly stellar week for the Suns. Ace Cameron Selik (3-0, 0.31 ERA in five starts) was promoted to high Class A Potomac. Harper was named “Sally” League player of the week (12-24, one homer, four doubles, dour RBI). And within a span of three days, two of the top arms in the Nationals’ organization, Ray and right-hander A.J. Cole, made their professional starting debuts. (Cole, 19, gave up five hits, including a homer, and two earned runs in 3 2/3 innings on Saturday.)
Cole and Ray, both of whom signed above-slot deals with the Nationals out of high school last summer, were kept in extended spring training until this week in order to get them acclimated to the every-fifth-day rhythm of professional baseball, without subjecting them to the volatile weather of April in the northeast.
“It was difficult,” Ray said, “because you’re pitching in front of about four guys, and all of them have got a radar gun. But once you get up here it’s a different story.”
I’ll repeat the disclaimer from above regarding Ray: This was just one outing, and on its own it doesn’t mean anything. But it is a rare treat to stumble upon a debut so impressive, and I thought you all would care to know about it.

More Stephanie Cutter and other Obama alums start consulting firm	By Rachel Weiner	May 2, 2013 at 5:00 am More Comments
Stephanie Cutter (AP Photo)
Three veterans of President Obama's 2012 campaign are launching a new consulting firm, Precision Strategies.
Obama deputy campaign managers Stephanie Cutter and Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, and digital director Teddy Goff, are behind the firm, which aims to take the winning formula of the Obama reelection and apply it not just to other campaigns and advocacy groups but to consumer brands, financial firms, and media and technology companies .
"We built and managed a $1.2 billion start-up called the Obama campaign ... inventing and exploiting the latest, data-driven tools and techniques," they say in a mission statement. We’d like to do the same for you — helping you to message, manage, and mobilize."
Also on the team are former Obama campaign spokesman Frank Benenati, Obama digital fundraising campaign manager Julia Prieto, and former Obama for America communications staffer Lucy Silver.
Precision Strategies promises to provide expertise in strategic planning, branding and communications, crisis management, digital strategy, data and analytics, and grass-roots campaign building and management.
Precision isn't the first firm with Obama connections to work in both the campaign and corporate world. Former White House communications director Anita Dunn works at SKDKnickerbocker, a PR firm that worked on Obama's 2008 and 2012 bids. Sixteen staffers from the 2012 campaign have joined Blue State Digital, another firm that worked on digital strategy for both campaigns and counts corporations like Google and AT&T as clients.
The Post's Suzy Khimm wrote earlier this year about corporate interest in former Obama campaign staffers.
"There’s less interest in the politics and more interest in the data and new media side,” said Jim Messina, Obama’s 2012 campaign manager. “It’s smart of everyone to take a look and say, ‘What do they know that we don’t?’ ”

Tell us about your diverse neighborhood
By Lynda Robinson
Most Washington area residents live in more integrated neighborhoods than they did even 10 years ago, with people of different races, ethnicities, and cultures side by side. Does that describe where you live?
We’d like to hear how your neighborhood is diverse. How do you and your neighbors socialize across racial and ethnic lines? How do your children get along? Is it different for kids than it is for adults?

More How the Internet is changing dating in 6 charts	By Andrea Peterson	October 21, 2013 at 2:50 pm More Comments
(Pew Internet & American Life Project)
The Pew Internet & American Life Project studies almost everything Americans do online. So it's no surprise they have the online dating scene covered. In a report released Monday, the project shows just how much the Internet has invaded Americans' romantic lives.
According to Pew's survey, 11 percent of American adults and 38 percent of those currently "single and looking" have used an online dating site or a mobile app. And 66 percent of those people have gone on a date with someone they met on such a site, while 23 percent report meeting a spouse or long-term relationship through the services.
It's not all candy and roses. Some 54 percent feel that "someone else seriously misrepresented themselves in their profile" and 28 percent of online daters "have been contacted by someone through an online dating site or app in a way that made them feel harassed or uncomfortable."
Despite these concerns, some 59 percent of Internet users view online dating as a "good way to meet people," and 53 percent say it "allows people to find a better match." Some 21 percent of Internet users say people who use dating site are desperate, but that's down eight points from 29 percent in 2005.
(Pew Internet & American Life Project)
Even if they haven't done any online dating themselves, a lot of Americans say they know someone who has tried it out. Some 42 percent of American adults say they know someone who has used it, while 29 percent say they know someone who entered into a marriage or long-term relationship with someone they met through online dating.
(Pew Internet & American Life project)
But even if American's aren't using a dating site, a lot of them use the Internet in their romantic life in other capacities. For instance, a majority of "single and looking" Internet users have flirted with someone online -- as have nearly 39 percent of people who have been married or partnered for 10 years or less. A fair number of Internet users also used the Internet to do research on previous dating partners.
(Pew Internet & American Life Project)
A lot of social media users use the sites to check up on previous partners -- especially the younger crowd, where nearly half of those ages 18 to 29 say they've looked them up. Younger people were also more likely to post details or pictures from a date, maybe because they (rightly) assume there's a fair chance an ex is going to be following their online presence.
(Pew Internet & American Life Project)
Social media users are also using the platforms to research fresh prospects -- or even make the first move. Thirty percent of users say they've used social networking services to research a prospective partner, while 15 percent bit the bullet asked for a date via the sites. Unsurprisingly, young whippersnappers ages 18 to 29 were more likely to do either of these things than their counterparts ages 30 to 49.
(Pew Internet & American Life Project)
But when a relationship sours, some also have to do some digital cleaning up to do -- especially younger users. Over a third of social media users ages 18 to 29 report "unfriending" or blocking a former partner. A similar proportion reported untagging or deleting photos of themselves with someone they used to date.
Andrea Peterson covers technology policy for The Washington Post, with an emphasis on cybersecurity, consumer privacy, transparency, surveillance and open government. She also delves into the societal impacts of technology access and how innovation is intertwined with cultural development.

More No, we don’t spend $1 trillion on welfare each year	By Mike Konczal	January 12 at 11:41 am More Comments
If you’ve read any conservative commentary on the war on poverty in the past week, you’ve likely seen this talking point: “We spend $1 trillion each year on welfare and there’s been no reduction in poverty.” That’s crazy! Then, a sentence later, you’ll probably see a line like this: “It’s true. According to a recent report, we spend a trillion dollars on means-test programs each year, yet the official census numbers show no reduction in poverty.”
A farmers market in Roseville, Calif. advertises its acceptance of EBT (electronic benefit transfer) cards, which are used for food stamps. (Rich Pedroncelli/AP)
If you are reading that second line quickly, you probably think it bolsters the credibility of the first line. It’s an “official” number, and the census and the report probably quote accurate numbers too, night? They do, but the second sentence is actually used as an escape hatch to say something that isn’t true. We don’t spend anywhere near a trillion dollars on welfare unless you mangle the term “welfare” to be meaningless, and we do reduce poverty.
First, Dylan Matthews has already dissected the claim that poverty hasn’t declined. It has. It’s just that the “official” poverty rate doesn’t factor in the earned-income tax credit or food stamps in its calculations. Given that these are two of the most direct ways that the government tries to lift people out of poverty, that’s a major problem. These programs do, in fact, lift people out of poverty--it just doesn’t show up in the official rate, because that’s how the rate is constructed.
The claim about $1 trillion on “welfare” is more interesting and complicated. It shows up in this recent report from the Cato Institute, which argues that the federal government spends $668 billion dollars per year on 126 different welfare programs (spending by the state and local governments push that figure up to $1 trillion per year).
Welfare has traditionally meant some form of “outdoor relief,” or cash, or cash-like compensation, that is given to the poor without them having to enter an institution. As the historian Michael Katz has documented, the battle over outdoor relief, has been a long one throughout our country’s history.
However, this claims says any money mostly spent on the poor is “welfare.” To give you a better sense here, the federal spending breaks down into a couple of broad categories. Only about one-third of it is actually what we think of as “welfare”:
1) Cash and cash-like programs: As Michael Linden of Center for American Progress told me, there are five big programs in the Cato list that are most analogous to what people think of as “welfare”: The refundable part of the Earned Income Tax Credit ($55 billion), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ($21 billion), Supplemental Security Income ($43.7 billion), food stamps ($75 billion), and housing vouchers ($18 billion) and the Child Tax Credit. All together, that’s around $212 billion dollars."
2) Health care: This is actually the biggest item on Cato’s list. Medicaid spends $228 billion on the non-elderly population, and children’s health insurance plan takes up another $13.5 billion. This is also roughly a third as well.
3) Opportunity-related programs: These are programs that are broadly related to opportunities, mostly in education or job-training. So you have things like Title 1 grants ($14 billion) and Head Start ($7.1 billion) in this category. But as Center on Budget and Policy Priorities’ Donna Pavetti notes, these programs don’t all go to poor people. For instance, Title I benefits school districts with a large share of poor children, however that money will help non-poor students attending those schools.
4) Targeted and community programs: What remains are programs designed to provide certain services to poor communities, which make up the bulk of the number of programs. Adoption assistance ($2.5 billion) and low income taxpayer clinics ($9.9 million) are two examples here.
So what should we take away from this?
--The federal government spends just $212 billion per year on what we could reasonably call “welfare.” (Even then, the poor have to enter the institution of waged labor to get the earned income tax credit.) And there have been numerous studies showing that these programs, especially things like food stamps, are both very efficient and effective at reducing poverty. They just don’t show up in the official poverty statistics, because that’s how the poverty statistics are designed.
-- Publicly funded services have never been thought of as welfare. I drive on publicly funded roads, but nobody analytically thinks of roads as belonging to category of “welfare.” If the poor take advantage of, say, a low-income taxpayer clinic, how is that welfare? Do taxpayer clinics encourage illegitimacy, dependency and idleness and other things conservatives worry about when it comes to welfare? This confuses more than it illuminates, which I imagine is the point.
Medicaid makes this very obvious. If a poor person gets access to decent health care, that’s not free money they get to spend on whatever they want. They aren’t “on the dole.”
-- The fact that Social Security and Medicare, major victories of the War on Poverty, aren’t here makes it clear something is wrong in the definition. Even though these are anti-poverty programs associated with the War on Poverty, nobody thinks of them as welfare, though they should fit this definition as well.
--It’s interesting to see conservatives consider opportunity programs to be “welfare,” because those programs broadly involve things they say they are for. Perhaps you think these programs are good investments or perhaps you don’t, but they are a whole other conceptual category than welfare, or just giving poor people money when they need it.
It’s also interesting to see conservatives lament the sheer number of anti-poverty programs. One reason this set-up exists is because so many programs are run through nonprofit groups (a set-up that makes us unique among developed countries). But conservatives have long tended to favor this arrangement, since nonprofit groups are supposed to boost civil society and provide an antidote to the nameless, faceless Big Government bureaucrats.
Read that again: conservatives complain that we should have less welfare and more opportunity and civil society, only to turn around and also call those things “welfare” too when the time comes.
-- Perhaps some of these programs should be discontinued, or expanded, or turned into straight cash. (How about cash instead of food stamps?) But we can’t have a productive conversation unless we make it clear what the government is, and is not, doing. And it is spending a lot less on welfare than conservatives claim, and getting fantastic results for what it does spend.
