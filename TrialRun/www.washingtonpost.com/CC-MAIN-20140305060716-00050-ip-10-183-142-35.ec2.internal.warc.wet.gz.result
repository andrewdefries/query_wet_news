Bad Lip Reading: behind the viral videos everyone’s talking about (Interview)
By Melissa Bell
Michele Bachmann’s sister talks to Big Foot. Rick Perry wants goats to work for our computer industry. President Obama knew a guy in college who made goats tell time. Your sister threw a “seafish” at Mitt Romney’s television.Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the latest to star in a Bad Lip Reading video.
(Elaine Thompson/AP)
If those sentences make no sense, you have yet to enter the universe of Bad Lip Reader, the eviscerating and hilarious video parodies that overdub presidential candidates and musicians with absurd sentences.
Like Auto-Tune the News was to political parodies in 2010, so is Bad Lip Reader to this election cycle. The videos reinterpret candidates’ speeches by putting words into their mouths in a sendup of the idea that politicians only talk nonsense.
The creator, who wants to remain anonymous, chatted with us by e-mail to explain why he started the parodies and why he’s not really trying to make a political statement. How do you know how to lip read?
Several years ago, my mother suddenly lost her hearing. She was in her 40s. In a matter of months, she went from having perfect hearing to total and irreversible hearing loss in both ears. That kind of loss would be terrible for anyone, of course, but she was a musician and a passionate lover of music and language. So, it was incredibly traumatic for her. And it was extremely difficult to watch her go through that loss. But one thing I found so amazing was how quickly she learned to read lips. She was astounding. The brain is capable of amazing things when it is left with no options. It was fascinating to watch her pick up this new skill, and it became absolutely vital to her. I found that I sometimes started watching TV with the television on mute ... to try to understand what her world was like. I'd try to understand what the people on screen were saying by reading their lips, but I was just terrible at it. I would occasionally pull out isolated phrases, but they were sometimes so bizarre that I instantly knew they were wrong. And that just made what my mother did even more amazing.
What motivated you to start this project? Earlier this year, I was hired to film two radio talk show hosts. One of the hosts had a curious habit of silently mouthing words to himself while the other guy was talking. He would look straight at the guy talking, listen to what he was saying but silently mouth phrases the entire time. He wasn’t mimicking or mirroring the other guy’s mouth movements. It was almost like he was rehearsing what he was going to say, but I couldn't understand how he could possibly know in advance what he was going to say in response to what the other guy was saying. I was shooting with a couple of other guys, and we kept looking at each other like: “What in the world is he doing? What is he saying?” It was disconcerting. And when I got the footage back to my studio, I looked at it, and I thought, “Hey, I wonder if I could read his lips and make out what he was saying!” I just wanted a snippet. One phrase. And I tried to do it, but, again, my brain kept coming up with completely random, strange interpretations. They were mainly random word combinations like “Bacon Hobbit” and “Moose potion, poke me” — things like that. So I grabbed my microphone and recorded these phrases into the computer, and when I played that back in sync with the video, it really looked like the guy was saying it. I was laughing so hard. I titled the video “What He Really Said” and sent it to the guys that were on the shoot with me, and it destroyed them. They were in tears. So, I did a couple of other videos like that, which just circulated between us as an inside joke.
When Rebecca Black’s “Friday” video came out right around the same time, it occurred to me that my newfound “skill” might be applied to songs. I muted “Friday,” and immediately noticed that it looked like she was saying “Gang Fight, Gang Fight.” I knew I had to make that song.
I was so attracted to the idea because the lyrics were so at odds with the visual component of the video. She was all smiles and teeny-bopper sunshine, and I loved how it was such an odd fit. I wrote and recorded an entirely new original song with the poorly lip-read lyrics I came up with. I totally changed the song; it has nothing in common with “Friday” except for the tempo and the basic structure. And as with the “Bacon Hobbit” video, when the audio was synced up with the video, it really looked like she was singing it. My friends encouraged me to put it on YouTube. So, I created a new channel, gave it the name “Bad Lip Reading,” threw on an intro and put the video out there. I had no idea it was going to get the response it did. Within two or three weeks, it had passed a million views, and I suddenly had 20,000 subscribers who wanted more videos. So, I started doing more of them, and the channel has continued to grow and grow and grow over the last seven months.
Why the switch from Rebecca Black to Rick Perry?
The songs take a while to do. I don't just crank them out as quickly as possible to get them out there. It’s gratifying when people say things like, “Wow, that is really funny! but, it’s also a catchy song — I listen to it when I workout!” It's nice that people also respond to them from a songwriting standpoint, as well as a humor standpoint. I often juggle three or four of them at a time, which stretches the process out even longer. I wanted to find something short and effective that I could upload to my channel as a kind of stopgap, something my subscribers could watch while I continued to finish the songs. I sort of just randomly landed on the political angle. It seemed very effective, not only because it was timely, but also because politicians come with so much talking-head material. I can’t even recall how I landed on Rick Perry specifically, but as soon as I started looking at it, I knew it would work. I just wasn't sure how my fans would respond to it. Fortunately, they liked it, and as the political videos have gone viral, they’ve introduced a whole new group of people to BLR.
You mock Obama and Bachmann. Are you a Republican, a Democrat or a bad lip reader?
I don’t really classify myself as Republican or Democrat. I don't like labels. That may sound trite or evasive, but I feel like many people look at labels and make a lot of assumptions that may or may not be accurate. I lean a bit more to the left than right, but when I do a Bad Lip Reading video of Michele Bachmann or Rick Perry, there is zero political agenda there. I'm not trying to bash conservatives or make them look foolish. I would just as happily do any Democrat or Liberal, as long as it made for an effective video. I'm not trying to influence politics. I’m just trying to make something people can laugh at. It’s simply funny to see any celebrity or politician saying bizarre and random things in a very earnest manner and I’m not going to limit myself to political videos.
I'd also like to note that I don't actually feel like I'm mocking the artists and politicians in my videos. At the very least, I have no ill will or malicious intentions. I make no commentary on their music or the policies they support. I don’t comment on their personal lives, the way they look, their recent scandals, their clothes. I am simply using their mouth-shapes to generate random phrases. I like to think that the people in the videos recognize that. Michael Buble got it. He understood that the BLR video I did of him (“Russian Unicorn”) actually had nothing to do with him personally. It was about making this new, strange thing.
He genuinely enjoyed it. He tracked me down, and we spoke by phone about the video, and he was just fantastic. Fox [television] showed Michele Bachmann her video, and she also got it. She thought it was funny. And I hope the others realize that, too. I'm not trying to pick on them. They have more than enough people doing that already.

This is how you make kids love math
VASILY FEDOSENKO/REUTERS - A pupil writes on the blackboard as he attends a mathematics lesson at a local school based in the remote Russian village of Bolshie Khutora.
By David Steel, E-mail the writer
David Steel is Executive Vice President of Strategy for Samsung Electronics North America. He holds a Ph.D. in physics from MIT and an MBA from the University of Chicago.
Of all U.S. high school students who graduated in 2011, only 45 percent were ready for college-level math and a mere 30 percent were ready for science, according to ACT, a college-entrance testing agency. These data reflect the great challenge facing the U.S. in preparing students for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers. Gallery
STEM and sports star wattage: There are athletes who have excelled in the STEM and STEM-related fields among the numerous sports stars who delayed their degrees or have yet to finish. We profile five here of both stripes. Latest from Ideas@InnovationsWhy you should sleep on the job

The surprising bond between a general and Silicon Valley
Justin Brady The general who leads the Air Force Academy shares tactics with Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh.
Unfortunately, this STEM challenge is having a negative economic impact on the U.S. For example, Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce predicts that by 2018, the U.S. will fall short by at least 3 million workers with college degrees.One of the obstacles to solving this problem is that students are simply not interested in or excited by STEM subjects. With the notable exception of Iron Man’s alter ego Tony Stark, our popular culture doesn’t often celebrate engineers, scientists, or mathematicians. According to a recent survey by Intel Corporation and Change the Equation, a non-profit coalition of more than 100 CEOs focused on STEM learning in U.S. schools, three out of five teenagers have never considered a career in engineering. So it’s no wonder that high school students can’t appreciate how STEM learning translates into a career. It’s not that students don’t like engineers or engineering. The Intel survey also shows that teenagers just do not understand exactly what it is that an engineer does. But when the teenagers surveyed understood that engineers create the tools and experiences that comprise their daily lives — such as texting on their smart phone, sharing experiences with friends on Facebook or creating gaming technologies -- more than half then expressed an interest in engineering.The difficulties of getting students excited by science are many. Funding is tight, teachers are strapped, and students are bored. But one opportunity to fight this slump is for technology companies to step up in order to raise interest in STEM education. While the schools focus on cultivating the capabilities, those of us in the tech sector can help address the challenge of interest. After all, it’s easier for tech companies to see the direct benefits of STEM since we live and breathe it every day. This is why collaboration between corporate America and the education sector is key to promoting this awareness. Companies, such as Boeing and IBM, are sending scientists and engineers into schools to talk about technology-focused careers and real-life experiences with hopes of piquing interest. Increased interaction between students and STEM professionals can help show that it is possible to study STEM subjects and still be cool. There are other structured ways in which businesses can support students’ hands-on application of STEM subjects, such as creating and sponsoring competitions and science fairs, as we’re working to do at Samsung. A similar approach can be seen from For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST), a non-profit that channels interest in STEM through team competitions. Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway, is the founder of the organization. Kamen started FIRST to inspire kids the same way that athletes and movie stars do – by showing them the possibilities are endless. But instead of being motivated to work on their three-point shot in the hopes of becoming a professional athlete, he wanted them to be empowered by scientists and engineers to be big thinkers. An important difference between the FIRST teams and sports teams that Kamen likes to point out is that every kid on a FIRST team can “turn pro.” FIRST has motivated 250,000 kids age 6-18 to compete in FIRST events. Studies also show that kids who participated are 50 percent more likely to go to college and twice as likely to major in science or engineering.With the great challenge of raising the interest level in STEM subjects, there is much that technology companies can do to get kids to see STEM as fun. That alone can be a big contribution to solving the current challenges around STEM education.
