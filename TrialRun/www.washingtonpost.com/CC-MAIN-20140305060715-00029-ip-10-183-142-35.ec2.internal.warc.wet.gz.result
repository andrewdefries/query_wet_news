Parents must bear some blame in baby’s death
By Tracy Grant, Sixteen years ago, when I was about five months pregnant with twins, I announced to my OB-GYN that I wanted to have the babies vaginally “without any drugs; no epidural.”
“Let me guess: You had a childbirth class last night, right?” he asked with a knowing smile. He said that he would abide by my wishes but that there were factors other than my desires at play here. This was a high-risk pregnancy, complicated by a placental bleed early on, a previous miscarriage and years of infertility. Tracy Grant
Writes Momspeak, a column on raising teenagers and other parenting issues, and edits KidsPost.

“It’s about the outcome, not the process, Tracy.”I’ve been thinking about his words a lot lately, and particularly as I read the latest report on the case of the midwife who pleaded guilty to child endangerment in the death of the Alexandria newborn she tried to deliver. Karen Carr, the midwife, says she now feels that she “sold my soul” in pleading guilty. When you work with birth, death is “just inevitable,” she said.She’s right. Sometimes babies die. Sometimes mothers die. Sometimes you do everything right and there’s a bad outcome. But sometimes bad outcomes can be avoided by good choices, sound decisions. Sadly, we’ll never know if the outcome in this circumstance could have been altered if different decisions had been made. But there’s a lesson for parents and children in this sad, sad tale. A lesson for parents about what we want vs. what’s best for our children, and a lesson we can teach our children that sometimes our choices have results that can never be undone, never taken back.First, there is too much blame involved in parenting these days. Parents who feed children only organic foods look down on parents who occasionally allow a Happy Meal to be consumed. “No screen time” is a red badge of courage worn by some parents who see themselves as superior to those of us who allow an occasional episode of “Arthur” or “Dora.” I recall being at a parenting seminar at which author Nancy Samalin asked, “Exactly who are you punishing when you take TV privileges away from a child?”But just as it’s wrong to blame parents for every misdeed of their children, it’s wrong to hold them blameless when they are egregiously irresponsible. That’s what the parents who had Carr deliver their baby were. There, I’ve said it.The woman in question was 43 and becoming a mother for the first time. The baby was breech. The parents had been told by an Alexandria birthing center that they could not deliver the baby at home because of the risk of complications from the baby’s position. Most breech babies are born by Caesarean section because of the possibility that the baby will, in essence, get stuck. The parents still wanted to deliver at home and sought out a midwife who would accede to their desires. Stop for a moment here. I have no doubt that these parents did not expect their baby to die. Bad things happening to other people is a defense mechanism that allows most of us to let our children ride their bikes to school, go to the movies alone, drive a car. But there is the normal risk associated with everyday life, and then there’s the kind of risk that has trained professionals advising you against your actions. When you ignore that advice, you are, in essence, signing a waiver saying that you accept responsibility, that what you desire outweighs the potential downside. It’s choice, all right. But it’s also selfish. Part of being a parent is about putting your children’s happiness (not to mention health) above yours. How else can you explain Chuck E. Cheese and Disney World? It’s why moms let a kid have the last cookie. To be fair, we don’t always do it happily (sometimes I really want that cookie) but we do it because it’s part of the job. For whatever reason, perhaps misplaced hubris, the parents in this case failed to put their child first.When our kids are throwing a ball in the house after being warned repeatedly not to and a favorite lamp gets broken, they are apt to say, “But I didn’t mean for anything bad to happen.” We wipe away tears, try to explain that sometimes bad things happen even when we don’t mean them to and that there are consequences for making bad decisions. Then we withhold allowance until a new lamp can be purchased. Not because the lamp mattered all that much, but because we hope that the lesson is learned on something as trifling as a lamp that you don’t always get “do-overs.” We hope the grief over the broken lamp will forestall the far worse grief 10 years down the line in an emergency room when your child is saying, “But I didn’t mean to hit that other car while texting.”The pain these parents feel is real; their hearbreak must be unspeakable. The punishment they are enduring over the loss of their son defines “cruel and unusual.” It is a punishment greater than anyone should ever be sentenced to. Worst of all, it is all so unnecessary.I think every one of us wishes we could give these parents a “do-over” and hopes that they would make a decision that was more about their child and less about them.“It’s about the outcome, not the process.”

John Engler
President, Business Roundtable
John Engler is president of the Business Roundtable (BRT), an association of chief executive officers of leading U.S. corporations with a combined workforce of nearly 16 million workers and more than $7 trillion in annual revenues. A former three-term governor of Michigan, Engler assumed the leadership of Business Roundtable in January 2011 after serving six years as president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers. As BRT president, Engler bring CEO expertise and insights to bear on major challenges facing the United States, including global competitiveness, innovation, economic growth and job creation. BRT-member CEOs lead global companies that invest more than $150 billion annually in research and development and generate nearly $500 billion in sales for small and medium-sized businesses annually. Through landmark reports, “Roadmap for Growth,” (2010) and “Taking Action for America: A CEO Plan for Jobs and Economic Growth,” (2012) Business Roundtable and Engler promote policies to enhance U.S. global economic leadership, including a restructuring of the nation’s system of taxation to broaden and lower corporate tax rates and move to a competitive territorial tax system. Under Engler, BRT has also emerged as a preeminent voice for regulatory restraint and transparency. Thanks to BRT-led litigation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck down the Security and Exchange Commission’s “proxy access” rule that would have put arbitrary limits on company management. The court agreed with BRT’s arguments that the commission has failed to do economic analysis as required by law. BRT CEOs’ advocacy also helped persuade President Obama to withdraw an overreaching regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency on ground-level ozone that would have been the most expensive regulation in U.S. history, inhibiting investment and hiring. BRT has also put forth detailed plans for streamlining federal regulation and permitting in two reports, “Achieving Smarter Regulations” (2011) and “Permitting Jobs and Business Investment: Streamlining the Federal Permitting Process (2012).” Engler came to BRT after heading the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) since 2004. As NAM president, he was the leading advocate for the nearly 12 million Americans employed directly in manufacturing, educating the public and policymakers on issues affecting this critical sector of the U.S. economy. Throughout his leadership at both the NAM and Business Roundtable, Mr. Engler has been heavily engaged in education and workforce issues, identifying the pressing shortage of skilled employees as a growing threat to American competitiveness in the 21st Century’s high-tech global economy. During Engler’s tenure as the 46th governor of Michigan from 1991 to 2003, he signed 32 tax cuts into law – saving Michigan taxpayers some $32 billion – and helped create more than 800,000 new jobs, taking the state’s unemployment rate to a record low. The top priority of his administration was improving education, with a focus on high standards, equity and accountability. Syndicated columnist David Broder summarized Engler’s service as governor as a “model of strong, executive leadership.” He had previously served for 20 years in the Michigan Legislature, including seven years as state Senate majority leader. Elected in 1970, Engler was the youngest person ever elected to the Michigan State House of Representatives. In 1990, he became the first sitting legislator elected Michigan governor in more than 100 years. Engler serves on the board of directors for Universal Forest Products and the Annie E. Casey Foundation and is a past chairman of the National Governors’ Association. The American Academy of Arts and Science has named him a member of the Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences. Born in Mt. Pleasant, Mich., in 1948, Engler graduated from Michigan State University with a bachelor of science in agricultural economics. Later, he earned a law degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Lansing, Mich. He and his wife, Michelle, are parents of triplet daughters born in 1994 – Margaret, Hannah and Madeleine – and live in Virginia.
