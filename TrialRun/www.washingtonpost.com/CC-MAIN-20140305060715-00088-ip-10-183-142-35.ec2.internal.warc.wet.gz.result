Dems dig in: GOP trying to sabotage economy on purpose
By Greg Sargent
In recent weeks, there’s been some question as to how far Dems are willing to go in making the explosive charge that Republicans are deliberately trying to sabotage the economy in order to improve their chances of defeating President Obama in 2012.
On a conference call just now with reporters, Senator Chuck Schumer made the most aggressive case we’ve heard yet along these lines, leaving little doubt that Dems are locking in behind this message as the deficit talks hit crunch time and as the 2012 campaign looms.
“Do they simply want the economy to go down the drain to further their political gain?” Schumer asked. “They seem to be against anything that may create jobs, because they view a weak economy as key to their political chances in 2012.”
“It’s an uncomfortable question, to be sure,” Schumer continued. “Are they trying to undermine the economy on purpose, for political gain? Harry Truman had a do-nothing Congress. The Republicans seem to be trying to make this a do-nothing-on-the-economy Congress.”
The latest evidence of this, according to Schumer: GOP Senators boycotted a hearing yesterday on three pending free trade deals they once supported.
“If there’s one thing the GOP has stood for throughout their history, it’s free trade,” Schumer said. “When Senator Baucus unveiled an agreement to proceed, you would have thought Republicans would jump for joy. Instead, Republicans took us down the rabbit hole once again.”
“Are Republicans opposing yet another measure they once supported simpy because that measure might be good for the economy?” Schumer asked, also citing GOP opposition to recent measures like a payroll tax cut and to small business development programs.
Pressed by a reporter on whether he really believes the GOP wants to destroy the economy on purpose, Schumer went further than ever before and took this out of the realm of the hypothetical.
“It’s a thought you don’t want to believe,” Schumer said, “but every day they keep giving us more and more evidence that there’s no choice but to answer Yes.”
The key point here is that Dem messaging chief Schumer is signaling that each example like this will now be pressed into service to build the larger case that Republicans have decided that a worse economy for the country is better politically for them, so any measure that risks creating jobs must be opposed at all costs. It seems like a clear effort to bait the GOP into responding to the charges, so the country can hear an argument over the GOP’s true motives. This line of attack also seems designed to persuade voters — and commentators who are reluctant to accept this sort of thing — that No, both sides are not equally to blame for our current travails.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Angus King expected to pick a party on Wednesday
The Washington Post - Newly-elected Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) announced Wednesday he will caucus with the Senate Democrats, saying “affiliating with the majority makes sense.”

When the Senate hosted a lunch for its new members-to-be Tuesday, most of the fresh faces showed up in pairs.
Sens.-elect Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) walked arm in arm into the Mike Mansfield Room across from the Senate chamber. Sens.-elect Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) also arrived together, while Sens.-elect Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) escorted their wives.

Angus King, the so-far independent senator-elect from Maine, walked in alone — though he may choose a partner soon.King had said he might wait until after Thanksgiving to pick a party, but senators are holding leadership elections Wednesday, forcing him to make a decision much faster than expected.“The important thing is that whichever decision I make . . . I don’t consider that building a wall between myself and the other party,” he told reporters Tuesday.During his two terms as Maine’s independent governor, he said, he worked with both parties on several issues.
In an interview before arriving Monday in Washington, King didn’t rule out joining with Republicans despite the fact that the GOP spent millions on attack ads against him during the campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R).“I’m not ruling it out, I’m not ruling it in,” he said. “I’m not ruling it out with the Democrats one way or the other, either.“I’ve had people urge me [to] not really talk to either side and not take a committee assignment and plant the flag in the middle of the aisle,” he added. “But I’m not inclined to do that because it makes what I’m doing a stunt.”Most observers and Senate aides expect King to join with Democrats in part because Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (Nev.) and other Democrats didn’t support members of their party in Maine’s Senate race on the assumption that King would join them next year.King and the 11 other new senators attended a series of briefings and receptions Tuesday. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) warmly greeted several new Democrats and their spouses, at one point turning to the wife of Sen.-elect Chris Murphy (Conn.) to say, “He’s going to love this job.”Warren dodged reporters several times Tuesday, and as she whisked by journalists with Baldwin, she told her new friend, “Pretend you’re talking to me.”Sen.-elect Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) held court, saying that he hoped to work with President Obama on fiscal issues “if the president is serious about what he said on the campaign trail” about bringing the parties together.King mostly ignored reporters’ questions as he roamed the halls. He began the day by visiting the offices of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), where they posed for a bank of cameras. Collins said that she looked forward “to welcoming Angus into the group of centrist senators who actually try to solve problems rather than just score political points.”Then the two exchanged gifts. Collins gave King a pair of Senate cuff links. He gave her a tea-maker.“Have you learned that your office is likely in the basement?” Collins asked King as they shook hands. “When I was a freshman senator, you actually had to get to the loading dock to get to my office and get through these slips of plastic and find your way.”“It’s still the United States Senate,” King replied.

Syria: what you need to know about the conflict
An activist wearing a gas mask is seen in the Zamalka area, where activists say chemical weapons were used by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in the eastern suburbs of Damascus.
(Reuters)
Written by
Masuma Ahuja
E-mail the writer
The United States is preparing to lead a possible military strike on Syria following allegations of a chemical weapon attack near Damascus last week that killed scores. Here are answers to seven questions about the situation in Syria, global reaction and where we go from here.
What is the United States going to do? In an interview with “PBS Newshour” on Aug. 28, President Obama said that the administration had concluded that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons and would repsond in some way, but did not specify any U.S. decision on possible airstrikes. David Nakamura explains:
Obama has said the use of chemical weapons would represent a “red line,” and administration officials are reportedly leaning toward a limited military response that would include bombings of strategic Syrian targets, but not the chemical weapon stockpiles that are thought to be hidden throughout the country.Administration officials have said that the goal would not be to remove Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power but to deliver a strong message that the international community will not abide the use of chemical agents.
Does Congress need to approve airstrikes before they happen? The White House has not indicated that the administration would seek Congress’ approval before taking military action. Members of Congress from both parties have written and co-signed letters asking Obama to seek congressional approval prior to airstrikes. House Speaker John Boehner has also asked Obama to consult with Congress about possible military action. David Nakamura explains:
On Wednesday, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) sent a letter to Obama demanding that he personally “make the case to the American people and Congress for how potential military action will secure American national security interests.”Obama briefed Boehner during a phone call Thursday afternoon, according to Boehner’s spokesman Brendan Buck. The speaker pressed Obama on the concerns outlined in his letter, Buck said, adding that “it is clear that further dialogue and consultation with Congress, as well as communication with the American public, will be needed.”
So is this the first time chemical weapons have been used? No. Chemical weapons have been used in the past but are a rarity. This incident would be the first major use of chemical weapons by a government against its own people in decades. Ernesto Londono explains:
If the weapons were deployed by the Syrian government, as Western officials allege, it would represent the first major chemical weapons attack by a nation against its own citizens since Saddam Hussein gassed Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988, an act so barbaric it galvanized the movement for a world free of chemical weapons.
What is the expected timeline of possible military action?
U.S. allies Britain and France have said they want to delay military action until they have the results of the U.N. inspections. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said that the United Nations team would leave Syria on Saturday and brief him immediately. It is expected that the U.N. Security Council will be briefed on the findings before any airstrike takes place.
What are possible targets of U.S. airstrikes?
On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said, “We are prepared. We have moved assets in place to be able to fulfill and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take. We are ready to go.”
This graphic, created by Gene Thorp, Anup Kaphle and Darla Cameron, maps possible strike targets in Syria as well as U.S. resources in the area.
How is the rest of the world responding? U.S. allies want to delay military action until there is conclusive evidence of chemical attacks from U.N. reports. At the same time, Russia — an Assad ally — and China are urging restraint.
Britain | Prime Minister David Cameron is engaged in a political fight in Parliament and has said he will delay action until the United Nations has reviewed a report from weapons inspectors in Syria. Anthony Faiola reports:
“It would be unthinkable to proceed if there was overwhelming opposition in the [U.N.] Security Council,” Cameron told Parliament.At the same time, the prime minister offered an impassioned argument for authorizing military action. He said evidence clearly indicates that the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for the deadly attack and declared that the West has an obligation to deter a possible repeat of “one of the most abhorrent uses of chemical weapons in a century.”
The British government also released a report Thursday that explained, “Military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting further such attacks would be necessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable.”
France | Faiola reports that France also seeks to delay military action:
French officials also are calling for a delay in action until U.N. inspectors conclude their report. “Before acting, we need proof,” said Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, a minister and government spokeswoman, according to Bloomberg News.
Russia | Will Engulnd reports that Russia is accusing the West of jumping the gun on Syria.
A British resolution in the U.N. Security Council condemning the Syrian government for using chemical weapons is premature given that the inspectors in Syria have not yet reported back on their findings, Russia’s first deputy foreign minister, Vladimir Titov, said in remarks quoted by the Interfax news agency.
China | William Van writes that China is urging the United States to exercise restraint.
“China calls on all parties to exercise restraint and calm,” said China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi. He said a political solution was “the only realistic way out on the Syrian issue.”Wang’s statement, posted on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Web site, was accompanied by a chorus of harsher editorials in China’s state-controlled media, accusing Western powers of rushing to judgment and using chemical weapons as an excuse to cover up less righteous motives.
Iran | Iranian officials have warned against U.S.-led military intervention in Syria and alluded to possible counterattacks on Israel. Jason Rezaian explains:
Iranian officials on Wednesday warned against a possible U.S.-led military strike on Syria in the wake of an alleged chemical weapons attack there last week.While some Iranian lawmakers implied that any foreign military intervention in Syria would result in counterattacks on Israel, the Islamic republic’s top leaders say their priority is averting a larger war in the Middle East.
Israel | While the U.S. and its allies are debating military action, nervous Israelis are rushing for gas masks. William Booth and Ruth Eglash report from Jerusalem:
A shortage of gas masks caused a mini-melee among panicky moms pushing strollers here Wednesday, as Israelis prepared for possible U.S. airstrikes against Syria that could trigger retaliatory attacks in Israel.
How are people in Syria responding to all of this? Residents of Damascus are anxiously awaiting a military strike. Loveday Morris and Ahmed Ramadan report from Beirut:
While potential options for military intervention were debated in the West, Damascenes did what little they could to prepare. The streets of the city were unusually quiet as residents said many had taken the day off work or joined thousands who have fled for neighboring Lebanon.

In Ukraine, U.S. Sens. McCain, Murphy address protesters, promise support
GLEB GARANICH/REUTERS - Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), left, takes a photograph as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) makes a speech to pro-European integration protesters in Kiev Sunday.
By Will Englund, E-mail the writer
KIEV, Ukraine — A showdown between Russia on one side and the United States and the European Union on the other drew closer here Sunday, as two American senators told a crowd of hundreds of thousands of protesters that Ukraine’s future lies to the west, not the east.
“We are here,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), “to support your just cause: the sovereign right to determine [Ukraine’s] own destiny freely and independently. And the destiny you seek lies in Europe.” Video

Ukraine demonstrators keep up protests: About 200,000 anti-government protesters converged on the central square of Ukraine’s capital on Sunday, a major indication that the opposition’s morale remains strong after nearly four weeks of daily protests. Added Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.): “Ukraine’s future stands with Europe, and the U.S. stands with Ukraine.” “Molodtsi,” the crowd chanted in Ukrainian, indicating its approval. But the president whom the opposition so despises, Viktor Yanukovych, is heading Tuesday for Russia to cement deals involving natural gas purchases and financial credits to prop up his country’s ailing economy. Yanukovych has vowed that he will not commit Ukraine to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s new Eurasian Customs Union, but the Ukrainian opposition doesn’t believe him.Murphy, McCain and European politicians who addressed the crowd in Kiev on Sunday turned up the pressure on Yanu­kovych, promising that their governments will consider individual financial sanctions against responsible Ukrainian officials if there is any further outbreak of police violence against the protesters who come and go at the semi-permanent encampment on Kiev’s Independence Square. Yanukovych has tried to mollify the opposition by resuming talks with the E.U. on a trade agreement. His Nov. 21 decision to back away from the deal triggered the protest movement. But in Brussels on Sunday, the E.U. commissioner for expansion, Stefan Fule, announced on Twitter that he was suspending negotiations with Ukraine on a revised trade agreement because Yanu­kovych’s words and actions on the issue were “moving further and further apart.”Ukraine’s arguments in favor of better terms than those agreed to earlier this year have “no grounds in reality,” Fule wrote. Still, Elmar Brok, a member of the European Parliament, told the crowd in Kiev, “The door for Ukraine to Europe is open.”Opposition leaders are concerned that if Yanukovych signs an agreement on Ukraine’s eventual membership in Russia’s Eurasian Customs Union, that would remove the possibility of a pact with the E.U. “If the agreement is signed, he can remain in Moscow and not return to Kiev,” Arseniy Yatsenyuk, head of the Fatherland party, said from the stage here Sunday. Demonstrators have turned out for three weeks in the encampment on Independence Square, expanding the scope of their protest to denounce police violence and political corruption. The protesters insist that they will not leave until Yanu­kovych is booted out of office. But it is unclear which side in the fight for Ukraine’s future has more stamina and resolve.The government is “expecting cold weather to break people’s spirits,” said Yakov Hutsul, 29, who runs an air-conditioning business in Ternopil, in western Ukraine. “But we’ll be here. Cold weather is not the main evil we’re contending with. There is no way back.” With the temperature hovering around freezing, Sunday’s demonstration appeared to be somewhat smaller than a huge rally a week earlier, but news agencies estimated that it still drew about 200,000 people, bedecked in hats, scarves and Ukrainian flags. A smaller rally of about 15,000 people, also arrayed in Ukrainian flag paraphernalia, showed its support for Yanukovych in a hilltop park near the parliament building. “We’re here so this can all end peacefully,” said Lyudmila Akhmedzhanova, 50, a teacher who, unusually for a Yanukovych supporter, comes from western Ukraine. “And we’re here for the European Union.”She said that she was not opposed to an eventual alliance with the European Union but that now was not the time. “We’re supporting Yanukovych because we need to wait a little,” Akhmedzhanova said. “With time, we can come to a European level.”At promptly 4 p.m., the Yanukovych backers dispersed. “These are all bureaucrats,” said Bogdan Vuyko, 57, who lives in Sevastopol and came to observe both camps. Most of the pro-government demonstrators were not from Kiev, he said. “They have to get home and get to work tomorrow.” Vuyko said some of his friends had been pressed by Yanukovych’s Party of Regions, which organized the pro-government rally, into attending. “Nobody’s actually listening to the speakers,” he said. The square where the protest against Yanukovych is rooted, known to all simply as “the Maidan,” has taken a central place in the lives of some Kievans. “When I wake up and turn on the radio and hear that the Maidan is still alive,” said Yelena Gorlocheva, 51, “I know I can get up and make myself a coffee.” Solid lines of police vehicles and heavily armored officers separated the two rallies Sunday. No serious incidents were reported. Kateryna Bondar, 22, part of the anti-government demonstration, said Yanu­kovych’s suspension of four officials Saturday for their involvement in a police raid against protesters was an insufficient step. She said that even if he fired the prime minister, Mykola Azarov, that still wouldn’t be enough. “He has to take first responsibility,” she said. “There’s nothing he can do to save himself. Firing others is a sign of cowardice.”She said the protest would continue until Yanukovych is gone. “You are making history,” Murphy, the senator, told the crowd. “If you are successful, the United States will stand with you every step of the way.” McCain commended veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan who have been helping to defend the protest site. “Ukraine will make Europe better,” he said, “and Europe will make Ukraine better.” He then quoted the 19th-century Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko: “Love your Ukraine, love her in cruel times, love her in cruel moments, pray to God for her.” Reprints
