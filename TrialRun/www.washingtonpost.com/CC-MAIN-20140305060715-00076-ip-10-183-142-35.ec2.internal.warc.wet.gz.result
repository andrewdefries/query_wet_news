Government workers keep on working after hours | #FedBuzz
By Stephen Cottle for GovLoop
Depending on whom you ask, government workers can be described as anything from sheltered employees in a bloated bureaucracy who have cushy 9-5 jobs to dedicated public servants who go above and beyond to keep understaffed programs running on shoestring budgets.
No matter which vision of the current state of affairs you subscribe to, there is one point most can agree upon: With all the talk about impending budget cuts, there is going to be a need to “do more with less.” Since that has implications for the workload of current government staff, the Federal Eye and GovLoop set out to take the pulse of government workers and see how many already work well beyond their normal eight-hour day.
While the reasons behind putting in extra hours varied, most responses to this week’s Federal Buzz question indicated that government workers frequently do take work home or work outside their normal working hours. Here are a few of the responses:
Lowell Marshall, Food and Drug Administration
Almost daily, due to the fact that I have a government-issued BlackBerry, and I run a very vibrant program. I don’t expect to be paid, and I’m not complaining about it, either. I’m proud to do what I do.
Michelle H., Department of the Treasury:
Every day, because we’re short-handed in my office and the work must get done — but I don’t get “overtime” as in extra money; I opt for “comp time” so I can add to my vacation time.
And no, contrary to what everyone might think — it’s NOT time and a half. If I work an hour I get only an hour.
Anonymous state government employee:
I have occasionally brought work home. There’s the random “look this up away from the net nanny” aspect of it where research is much easier done in the freedom of your own internet rather than the monitored and locked down one at work. There have also been a couple of times when I needed peace and quiet and concentration and the only way to get that was at home over the weekend. I do try to make it the exception, not the rule.
Different bosses have different expectations. and there is one with a “X must be done, don’t care how or why, just results” attitude ... others know and respect that you have a life and want to live it. Sam Lovett, GovLoop fellow and former state government employee:
As part of my government work, I used to wake up early and compile a large report (a News Summary) of all the pertinent media stories related to my office. It was signed, sealed, and delivered to staff email inboxes before anyone arrived at the office. I was able to arrive to work a little late, but the equity of time didn’t work in my favor.
I didn’t get paid more for any of the extra work I put it, but the report was appreciated by my co-workers who recognized the time I gave up (and the sleep I didn’t get) so they could do their jobs better.”
Employee, Department of Veterans Affairs
As a human resources manager in a large federal agency, I live on my BlackBerry — while on leave, nights and weekends. My day typically begins at 6 a.m. and goes until 5 p.m., often with no lunch, so 15 hours of overtime per week. And this doesn’t include BlackBerry time! I figure with over 25 years of dedicated government service I have donated approximately 16,500 hours just to do my job.
Employee, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
Almost every day. Budget cuts and uncertain future budgets have meant that we no longer replace staff that leave. I am currently doing my job and have taken on the entire portfolio of a colleague who left for another job.
Deadlines still need to be met, so I regularly work 10, 11, 12 hours per day, and usually check in over the weekend.
Employee, U.S. Army
I try to avoid working extra hours. Between the nine-hour days and the hour-plus commute, I don’t have enough hours in the day to work extra AND get enough sleep at night, let alone exercise, pay bills, etc. I’m single and have no partner to help me take care of the house. Everything is my responsibility.
Even if I did work extra hours, the Army does not pay overtime. Once I had accrued comp time that automatically converted to overtime pay because it had been on the books for 12 months, and my bosses were all over me about that.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
The Central African Republic descending into ‘complete chaos’
(Matthieu Alexandre/ AFP/Getty Images - Caritas International ) - Attacks and fighting in Central African Republic have displaced as many as 400,000 people, many fleeing into the forests or neighboring countries.
CAPTION
By Sudarsan Raghavan, E-mail the writer
The warnings have become more dire: The Central African Republic “is descending into complete chaos before our eyes,” the U.N. deputy secretary general said this week. France, the country’s former colonial power, pledged Tuesday to send 1,000 troops there after declaring last week that the situation was “on the verge of genocide.”
Something terrible is happening in this country in the middle of Africa. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes, and an unknown number have been killed in attacks over the past several months. Post correspondent Sudarsan Raghavan, based in Nairobi, helps explain the crisis and why world powers are suddenly so concerned.

Libya: Niger extradites Gadhafi’s son al-Saadi

Bombings, clashes in Iraq kill at least 42
Associated Press No one claimed responsibility for the string of bombings, mostly from parked car bombs and one explosive planted in an outdoor market. ●
How did the fighting start?
In March, a rebel alliance called the Seleka marched from the predominantly Muslim north of the country and seized the capital, Bangui. President François Bozizé, who had come to power in a 2003 military coup, was ousted, and rebel leader Michel Djotodia declared himself president. ●
What happened after that?
According to Human Rights Watch, the Seleka rules “arbitrarily and with complete impunity.” Its forces are accused of attacks on villages, rape and widespread looting. In recent months, self-defense groups, mostly made up of Christians, have been fighting the Seleka and targeting Muslims, provoking revenge attacks. Muslims make up 10 percent to 20 percent of the population in the predominantly Christian country.●
What are they fighting about?
Mostly power, control of territory and past grievances. The country also has extensive agricultural and mineral resources. Its main exports are diamonds, timber, coffee and tobacco. It also has reserves of gold and uranium.●
What has been the effect on civilians? Human rights groups say the Seleka has killed many civilians and destroyed hundreds of homes and scores of villages. The attacks and fighting have displaced as many as 400,000 people, many fleeing into the forests or into neighboring countries. Estimating the number of dead has been difficult because much of the violence has occurred in remote areas. Human rights activists also accuse the Christian vigilante groups of committing abuses.●
Aren’t U.S. troops in central Africa, aiding the search for Joseph Kony, the warlord who leads the Lord’s Resistance Army? Yes, and Kony is widely thought to be hiding in the Central African Republic. But he and his band of murderous rebels are not involved in the ongoing crisis. For more than two decades, however, the LRA has killed, maimed and kidnapped villagers across the region.●
So the Central African Republic had problems before the coup?
The country has been unstable since its independence from France in 1960. The landlocked nation of about 5 million people is one of the poorest and least-developed in the world. Its recent history has been marred by brutal and corrupt regimes, most installed by coups. Perhaps the most well known was that of Jean-Bédel Bokassa, who crowned himself emperor and began a reign of terror that included an alleged massacre of schoolchildren. He was overthrown in 1979 in a military coup backed by French commandos. The cycles of violence have led to a proliferation of weapons in the country.●
Is the country on the verge of a genocide?
France has said so, and a special U.N. adviser called the crisis “one of the worst human rights and humanitarian crises of our time.” The United States has been more cautious in its assessments (and has pledged $40 million to strengthen an African Union force in the country, but it has said that U.N. peacekeepers are not yet needed). ●
Is the international community doing anything?
France’s announcement Tuesday that it will send 1,000 troops to the country to help stem the violence comes amid mounting concern. The force bolsters an existing contingent of 420 French soldiers protecting the airport in the capital. The deployment marks the second time this year that France has dispatched troops to an African nation. In January, France staged a military intervention against radical Islamists who had seized control of northern Mali. There are 2,500 African troops in the Central African Republic, and there are plans to bolster that force. The U.N. Security Council is considering options to stop the violence.●
Will sending in U.N. peacekeepers affect other U.N. missions in Africa?
It could. U.N. officials say that if conditions deteriorate quickly, peacekeepers might be pulled from one of the other U.N. peacekeeping operations in sub-Saharan Africa, including those in Congo, Mali and the Darfur region of Sudan. All these places are gripped by conflict and insurgencies, and the international community could find itself spread thin.
