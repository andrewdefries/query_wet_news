Carolyn Hax: Pre-wedding jitters or wise second thoughts?
By Carolyn Hax, Hi, Carolyn:
I’m 25 and engaged to the guy I’ve dated since I was 20. I feel like I’ve always been the one pushing the relationship forward, from wanting to be exclusive to giving an ultimatum that I was going to leave him if he didn’t propose by the time I turned 25 last summer (not my best decision, and I had been pressuring him for a proposal long before that as well). Carolyn Hax
Carolyn Hax started her advice column in 1997 as a weekly feature for The Washington Post, accompanied by the work of “relationship cartoonist” Nick Galifianakis. She is the author of “Tell Me About It” (Miramax, 2001), and the host of a live online discussion on Fridays at noon.

The conservative gathering gives activists a chance to mull over “the woman problem,” yet not many high-profile, elected women will be on the stage.

He moved out of my condo once without telling me while I was on a business trip, then moved back in a year later, a few months before the engagement. Then a couple of months ago, he told me he wasn’t sure he wanted to marry me and I flipped out and said, “Fine, move out,” before leaving on yet another business trip. He then changed his mind before I got back. We’ve been to a therapist twice, and he swears he’s committed to me. But now I’m thinking that for some unknown reason, I was so busy chasing him when we were dating, I ignored a lot of flaws (he’s great on paper — Ivy League lawyer, good cook, attractive). How do I tell if this is just pre-wedding jitters or something we could work out, or if my worries are not just what a normal person feels before their wedding?
Engaged
Your honesty about yourself is refreshing. The conclusion you draw, though, doesn’t go far enough.Specifically: You say you “ignored a lot of flaws” — as if, ultimately, your fiance’s shortcomings are the problem. They’re a problem, sure, since there’s troubling cowardice in his actions, but the problem needing your attention above all is your own frailty.You didn’t love a person, you pursued a trophy. That’s a serious admission you fall just short of making. (Lost your nerve, I suspect; it’s hard to snitch on ourselves.)It’s also a serious problem for both of you, because you don’t curl up with a skill, or converse with an achievement, or identify with a symmetrical face, or raise children with snooty insignia sportswear. You interact with the whole person and whatever habits, quirks, smells, opinions and truths ride along. I’d say “flaws,” but I’m not prepared to validate your use of that word. Since I don’t have specifics, it’s possible what you’re labeling as such are just traits of his that don’t excite you the way his résumédoes. Let’s say you have different senses of humor or different priorities and goals, just to give two common examples — it’s not that one of you is right and the other’s wrong, or one’s perfect and the other flawed, but instead that the two of you don’t match up well. Dishonesty, possessiveness or rudeness? Those are flaws. Not getting along, that’s a flaw in your relationship, not in him.So take a hard look, both at him and the relationship. Do you love who he is, not just what, as he deserves? When you’re alone, are you comfortable, safe, yourselves? Are you willing to test that by admitting to him what you’ve written here? And offering to call things off, without drama, out of respect for him?You’ve done some obvious growing up to get to this point. For your sake and his, please finish that process, stat.

Tornado Alley should build shelter from the storms
By Kurt Hochenauer, Kurt Hochenauer is an English professor at the University of Central Oklahoma. He blogs at OkieFunk.com.
EDMOND, Okla.
When disaster hits, Oklahomans bask in helping others. We’re good at it. Some call it the “Oklahoma spirit.” But even as we’re cleaning up the debris and mourning those killed by the mile-wide tornado that devastated Moore and other parts of the Oklahoma City suburbs on Monday, too many aren’t addressing what we can do to reduce potential damage in the future. The fact that our state is in an area nicknamed Tornado Alley underscores how likely it is that violent weather will occur here. So why doesn’t every structure regularly used in this state have an underground storm shelter? Underground shelters save lives. Let’s build them under or at least near our homes, offices and, of course, our schools. Let’s have more public and community shelters, and put up signs so residents know where to find them. The benefits of shelters are established. Last year, Oklahoma launched a program in conjunction with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to reimburse homeowners a share of the costs of building a shelter on their property. Within three months of SoonerSafe registration opening, about 16,000 people signed up. But only 500 won a lottery to receive federal funds when the program began operating. This week the mayor of Moore has called for requiring shelters in all new construction. But what about the thousands of buildings that are already here? Communities in earthquake-prone areas build with the understanding that their structures have to withstand violent acts of nature. Why don’t we construct more of our buildings, especially our schools, with stronger materials?The answer is that we can but we choose not to. Such ideas have been put forth and dismissed by those in power here for many years. State leaders are too busy cutting taxes for the wealthiest — who can afford underground shelters — to consider allocating funds for those who would pay for safety if they could. While the costs are too high for many individuals to bear, the expenses are not necessarily that great. FEMA estimates that construction of an 8-foot-by-8-foot safe room ranges from $6,600 to $8,700. Is that too high a price to save lives? This discussion shouldn’t be limited to Oklahomans. For one thing, local leaders haven’t been getting enough done. And taxpayers outside our state provide funds that contribute to our recovery efforts and our safe-room program. It’s also possible that those studying our situation from a distance can home in on answers.National media outlets surveying the damage this week have posed a lot of tough questions: Why don’t all Oklahoma schools have underground shelters? Would improvements to our warning systems have given people more time to escape the storm? Was the tornado’s strength related to climate change? And why have so many homes been rebuilt in an area known for destructive tornadoes? Such questions need to keep coming.Left alone, we haven’t been addressing these issues in ways that will keep Oklahomans safe. Too many here refuse to look seriously at the extreme weather events the Midwest has experienced in recent years and what role climate change might have played. Ultimately, this is a question of values: Will our state and local leaders value their constituents’ lives enough to allocate funds to build better, stronger buildings and underground shelters?Students died Monday in a school that lacked an appropriate shelter. Future pain and suffering will be minimized only if we look realistically at our budgets and our climate. Far too often our weather is deadly violent. While we cannot control that, we can act to prevent or reduce death, injuries and destruction when such violence strikes.

Beautiful photography transports readers to garden spots nearby and far away
By Joel M. Lerner, E-mail the writer
Beautifully illustrated books continue to be among the best ways to keep up with the latest trends in landscape design. Several new favorites of mine cover a wide range of landscape-related topics — and offer the opportunity to view the world from the comfort of your armchair.
•“Hamptons Gardens,” by Jack deLashmet (Assouline, 2011, $150), is about the communities of farmers and fishermen that were founded more than 350 years ago on the easternmost reaches of Long Island, N.Y. The Hamptons include about 12 individual hamlets and villages with some of the most expensive real estate in the country. The author, a landscape designer, discusses residents’ desire to maintain gardens on their estates. Well-known landscape architects and designers have practiced their art in this pocket of wealth; the book features the work of Russell Page; Edwina von Gal; Oehme, van Sweden; and Miranda Brooks. Styles range from sustainable native gardens to minimalist, manicured landscapes and meandering meadows. More on this Topic

Where We Live: Revitalized Stanton Park like microcosm of D.C.
DeLashmet’s interpretations of these gardens are well-written and offer hundreds of ideas for your landscape design. With the exception of well-publicized Grey Gardens, emphasis is placed on gardens that have not been written about extensively and toured regularly by the public. The 155 color illustrations are magnificent with the text outlining the impetus influencing the landscape professionals. They offer a window into how the pros worked with their clients to ensure that the designs reflected the clients’ desires. You can use this beautiful 268-page coffee-table hardcover to discover how some of the best-known landscape designers in the world decide what elements will make their work shine. The author is donating 100 percent of his royalties to God’s Love We Deliver, a provider of nutritious, individually tailored meals to people who are ill and unable to shop or cook for themselves. •“American Eden: From Monticello to Central Park to Our Backyards: What Our Gardens Tell Us About Who We Are,” by Wade Graham (Harper Collins, 2011, $35). Although the title implies that it’s a history going back to Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello home, built in the late 1700s, the book actually goes back over a century earlier to the styles that influenced Jefferson and his contemporaries. Graham goes into great detail about Jefferson’s influence on a distinctly American style and generally considers him as the developer of our earliest garden designs.The author describes subsequent periods in American garden design, including the arts-and-crafts garden, which lasted from about 1850 to 1945. Hedges, pergolas draped in vines, stucco walls and handcrafted lamps and finials defined much of this period. This 459-page collection of landscape design history in this country is enjoyable reading. It is well researched, posing an interesting historic tie from the past to the present. •“The Living Garden: A Place That Works With Nature,” by Jane Powers (Frances Lincoln Limited, 2011, $35), begins by explaining ways the natural world takes care of itself. The balance of nature is a well-ordered system, cyclical and reliable. It is only in about the past 20 years that most humans have understood that this cycle is driven by billions of living and dying organisms all playing a part in the health of our planet.The author illustrates the importance of this balance among plants, wildlife and people. She describes the simple example of a plant’s growth, its demise, composting and return to the soil to add nourishment for the next generation of life. Water is an integral part of this process, as are recycling cans, bottles and milk cartons for container planting, stone for walkways, and bales of straw for compost bins that will decay in time, themselves providing compost. This 216-page hardcover guide also covers garden planning and is illustrated with more than 100 high-quality color images. •“Exotic Gardens of the Eastern Caribbean,” by Margaret Gajek and Derek Galon (Ozone Zone Books, 2010. Includes an audio CD, “The Sounds of the Eastern Caribbean.” $37.95), just won the prestigious Silver Nautilus 2011 international book award. Galon’s brilliant photography captures the pride Caribbean people have in their gardens. The text, written by Gajek, an art historian, describes the atmosphere of the eastern Caribbean.Barbados Coconut Growers Garden is the first stop, where the authors discuss the banana and coconut crops grown there. Redland Plantation, once a sugar plantation, has been renovated and transformed into an organic fruit and vegetable farm. Photographs show the variety of flora planted in the designed gardens and artistic structures.This 288-page hardcover uses English and French throughout to transport you to the Caribbean.
Joel M. Lerner is president of Environmental Design in Capitol View Park.
