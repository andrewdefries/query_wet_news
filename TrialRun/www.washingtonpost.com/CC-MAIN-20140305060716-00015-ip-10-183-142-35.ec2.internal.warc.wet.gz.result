Time to improve your financial knowledge
By Michelle Singletary, The major financial activity people associate with April is tax day.
But April is also the perfect month to push financial literacy. After all, you’ve had to pull together major information about your finances to do your taxes.

Opening the mailbag
Michelle Singletary Readers ask about secure credit cards, refinancing a home and owning a dog.
Investing in Bitcoin has a dangerous flip side
Michelle Singletary The volatile investment is too risky for most investors.
Unscrupulous folks target taxpayers eager to get a refund
Michelle Singletary Every year, the Internal Revenue Service puts out its top 12 tax scams. Identity theft leads the list.
So what ya doing for Financial Literacy Month?I get questions all the time from people who want to be better at handling their finances. During a recent speaking event, a worker asked how he could get his wife to show more interest. Take her to a financial class, I recommended.Look, if you can spend hours watching NCAA basketball games (and I’m not saying you shouldn’t; I’m disappointed that my Maryland Terps didn’t make it to the finals), or two hours watching a dumb movie, or waste time playing any number of apps on your smartphones (I can get trapped in an “Angry Birds” game for much longer than I care to admit), then why the heck can’t you take advantage of the many workshops or programs offered this month?The answer is that you can. And you should because you keep saying to yourself that you need help. Forty percent of U.S. adults graded themselves a C, D or F on their knowledge of personal finance, according to the most recent financial literacy survey by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling and the Network Branded Prepaid Card Association. Nearly four in five survey participants said they could use some professional advice and answers to everyday financial questions.When asked what worries them the most, 57 percent of Americans said a lack of savings. Forty-three percent are concerned about not having enough money for an emergency.Well, stop worrying and do something about it. America Saves, a campaign managed by the Consumer Federation of America, has launched a text-message service that will send tips and personalized texts to people who pledge to save.The campaign is offering a nice little carrot to encourage a commitment. It is giving away $500 to one person, chosen at random from all who sign up for the text messages. You have to be 18 or older. Standard messaging rates apply, so be sure you aren’t running up text charges trying to win money.The promotion runs until April 30. To sign up, go to americasaves.org/pledge. Here’s what some of the agreement says: “I [you type your name] pledge to save money, reduce debt, and build wealth over time. I will encourage my family and friends to do the same. I pledge to save $ [fill in the dollar amount] for [set a time frame] month/s.”There’s a pull-down menu so you can select a specific savings goal. The texts will be customized based on the goal you pick.America Saves Director Nancy Register said her organization is intrigued by experiments conducted in the Philippines among low-income bank account holders. Researchers found that sending regular text messages reminding and encouraging people who had set a savings goal to stay on track increased the total amount saved by 6.3 percent.“Even now, a significant number of lower-income consumers don’t have home access to computers,” Register said. “Youth and young adults communicate more frequently by text than e-mail.”In the case of the America Saves promotion, organizers are banking on the cash award to spur actual saved dollars. “So many incentives are really retail strategies,” she said. “You have to spend to save. Many savings tips, like clipping coupons or waiting for deals, are about spending less.”I love the idea of the contest. It’s also very true that many savings strategies still encourage spending. I always say, you never save when you spend. You might be spending less, but you are not engaging in the action of saving.America Saves has it right. A little enticement doesn’t hurt. The Council for Economic Education is having a contest for K-12 teachers. The council is offering a $1,000 prize for the educator who comes up with the most creative video (30 or fewer seconds) demonstrating a specific financial literacy lesson, activity or project. Teachers can find details at councilforeconed.org. Videos will be accepted through April 14.The American Library Association and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago are promoting “Money Smart Week” April 20-27 at local libraries. You can find a class at moneysmartweek
.org and more information at ala.org/offices/money-smart-week.Even if money isn’t on the table, take some time to search for a local financial literacy event this month. Yes, leave your home so that you can improve your financial house.

Bill Maher and Tim Tebow: Why are so so many offended by the quarterback’s faith?
View Photo Gallery — The quarterback for the Denver Broncos has become a polarizing figure in football, in part because of his outward displays of Christian faith. By Sally Jenkins, E-mail the writer
If God is liable to smite anybody around here, it’s me. When it’s smiting time, I duck, because I don’t believe in any religion that requires a building and loan payments. Nevertheless, I’m having a hard time seeing anything wrong with Tim Tebow taking a prayer knee in public. The knee seems a pretty plain and graceful statement, and it’s tiresome to see it so willfully misinterpreted. It’s the preachers from the top of Mount Idiot like Bill Maher who are hard to understand.
If you want to know Maher’s overriding philosophy on anything, you have to go back to high school and the stoner in the last row, surrounded by sycophants as he makes ugly cracks about his betters. That was the vein of the tweet that Maher chucked at Tebow on Christmas Eve, after the Broncos quarterback was intercepted three times in a loss to the Buffalo Bills. Maher wrote, “Wow, Jesus just [expletive] Tim Tebow bad! And on Xmas Eve! Somewhere in hell Satan is Tebowing, saying to Hitler, ‘Hey, Buffalo’s killing them.’ ”

Tracee Hamilton: The NFL taught me to believe in jinxes
Set aside the intriguing question of whether Maher would have the nerve if Tebow were Muslim. Or whether he’s funny. (He’s not, really. Monty Python is.) What’s more interesting is why Maher, and other political commentators from Bill Press to David Shuster, feel compelled to rip on Tebow simply for kneeling. “I’m tired of hearing Tim Tebow and all this Jesus talk,” Press said, adding a profane suggestion that Tebow should shut up. They act like he’s trying to personally strip them of their religious liberty, manipulate the markets, and take over our strategic oil transport routes. What is so threatening about Tebow? It can’t be his views. Tebow has never once suggested God cares about football. Quite the opposite. It’s Maher and company who stupidly suggest a Tebow touchdown scores one for Evangelicals whereas an interception somehow chalks one up for atheism. Anyone who listens to Tebow knows he doesn’t do Jesus talk, he’s mostly show and no tell. His idea of proselytizing is to tweet an abbreviated Bible citation. Mark 8:36. He leaves it up to you whether to look it up. When he takes a knee, it’s perfectly obvious that it’s an expression of humility. He’s crediting his perceived source, telling himself, don’t forget where you came from. On the whole, it’s more restrained than most end-zone shimmies.So why does Tebow’s expression of faith make people so silly-crazy? Why do they care what he does?Because he emphasizes the aspect of his talent that is given, not earned.And that makes people nervous. The reactions to Tebow seem to fall under the category of what theologian Michael J. Murray calls “Theo-phobia.” In his essay “Who’s Afraid of Religion?” Murray argues we’re ill at ease with intrusions of personal faith. We fear they could lead to oppression, or mania, or even prove us wrong. We prefer to keep religion at the abstract distance of historical or socio-cultural discussion, the safe range described by historian George Marsden, “like grandparents in an upwardly mobile family, tolerated and sometimes respected because of their service in the past. . . but otherwise expected either to be supportive or to stay out of the way and not say anything embarrassing.”When Tebow kneels on the field, his religion becomes challengingly present. Tebow doesn’t have to get into a bunch of Jesus Talk to put you or me in an uncomfortable state of mind. It’s more subtle than that. Murray suggests, if I have a reaction to the Knee, it’s because Tebow implies “that there is something in the universe over and above the natural which deserves my attention, allegiance, or honor and I find that distasteful or irritating.”Just when you’re trying to mindlessly surrender to an afternoon of pleasure, Tebow begs the question, what if faith actually, well, works? Regardless of whether you believe Tebow’s athletic talent is random and indiscriminate, or bestowed and directed, when you watch his fourth-quarter comebacks it is impossible not to notice that faith is an undeniable performance enhancer, at least as powerful as any drug. For whatever reason. Tebow isn’t the first athlete to be lifted above his apparent capacities by his beliefs. The phenomenon is hardly restricted to Evangelicals. Back in 2005 a Pakistani cricket batsman named Yousuf Youhana converted from Catholicism to Islam. The next season his batting average soared to 83.06 from 47.30. Whenever he scored 100 runs, he kneeled in the direction of Mecca and prostrated himself to Allah. He broke the world record for most test runs in a calendar year. When asked the difference in his play, he replied that he had simply become a better man. But not everyone was comfortable with his transformation into Mohammad Yousuf, and his Mecca gazing. The Pakistani government, in an effort to curb what it saw as Islamic overzealousness, ordered the chairman of the cricket board to forbid extreme religious displays. It was interpreted as an attempt to de-Islamify the squad. In their next match, the Pakistanis lost by 51 runs.I’ve been trying to think of other public figures who disconcerted their audience with displays of faith. Then one came to me: George Harrison. On the recent anniversary of Harrison’s death, writer Andrew Ferguson described seeing Harrison during his solo tour of the States, making 40,000 roaring people suddenly uncomfortable simply by singing about his Hinduism.“I still marvel at the nerve it must have taken, singing about God, of all things, in front of kids thumping for rock ’n’ roll, not to mention the wised-up musicians and the cynics and pedants of the concert-reviewing press,” Ferguson wrote. Plenty of people complained about Harrison’s dragging Hinduism into concert halls, but, “Because George insisted, some of us felt obliged, for the first time in our lives, to take the idea [at least] of God seriously.” Belittle Tebow if you must. But the trouble with shouting down Tebow’s religion, never mind the sheer offensiveness, is the same trouble with shouting down any other form of inspired expression. Do that, and you also shout down mystery, possibility, surprise. And some perfectly good questions. You drown out an awful lot that’s of interest, whether you agree with it or not.

Full Coverage: The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial
Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial architect says controversial inscription will stay
View Photo Gallery — Workers at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial cleaned and prepared the new monument for its official unveiling. By Michael E. Ruane, E-mail the writer
The executive architect for Washington’s new Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial says there are no plans to change a controversial inscription on the memorial’s statue of King in the wake of complaints that it makes the civil rights leader seem arrogant.
Ed Jackson Jr. says he stands by the project’s decision to inscribe on the statue a paraphrase from the famous “drum major” sermon King delivered in 1968, two months before his assassination in Memphis.

The Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial was revealed to members of the press before opening to the public. The design is derived from part of King's famous \"I have a dream\" speech when he said, \"With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.\" The memorial sits by the tidal basin between the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials.

The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial
Full Coverage
The noted poet and author Maya Angelou has said the inscription — “I was a drum major for justice, peace, and righteousness” — is a misleading, inaccurate truncation that makes King sound like an “arrogant twit .”King’s sermon was a critique of the individual’s instinct to be on top, to lead the parade, to be the “drum major.” He also spoke of a eulogy that might be given upon his death.“Yes, if you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice,” he said. “Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter.” The Washington Post, in a lead editorial Friday, described the memorial’s paraphrase as a “ham-handed” effort that turns a “conditional statement into a boast” and urged that the inscription be changed.
The $120 million memorial is on a four-acre site on the northwest shore of the Tidal Basin, just southwest of the World War II Memorial. The inscription appears on the north face of the 30-foot-tall granite statue of King that is the memorial’s centerpiece.The memorial opened to the public Aug. 22. It’s scheduled dedication on Aug. 28 was postponed by Hurricane Irene. A new date had not been set as of Friday.The initial complaints about the inscription emerged after a Post opinion piece by the newspaper’s Rachel Manteuffel last week expressed dismay about the paraphrase. She called for it to be altered. “Let’s get the chisels back out,” she said.Jackson reiterated Friday that he believes the paraphrase is proper and fitting: “We felt it was quite appropriate for (King) to define himself . . . ‘I was a drum major for peace, justice, and righteousness.’ You can’t get any more succinct than that.”He said the memorial’s sculptor, Lei Yixin, and the inscription carver, Nick Benson, felt that the inscription should be “very brief and succinct.” He said it was not designed to be a direct quote.Jackson said the full quote would not fit in the allotted space on the statue’s north face and rejected the idea of a smaller adjustment. Manteuffel, for example, found the absence of the word “if” especially troubling.Jackson said: “The word ‘if’ suggests that . . . he’s not sure of who he was. . . . We have the historical perspective. We can say emphatically he was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness.”Asked if the inscription could be altered in any way, the architect said, “No.”“The space is not there” and the overall design and layout of the inscription on the statue would not permit it, he said. “We don’t have an enormous palette here.”He said he has had no official calls for the inscription to be changed.
