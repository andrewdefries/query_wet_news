Obama sees blowback on inane Bain attack
By Jennifer Rubin
There are signs the Obama campaign of smears and falsehoods is wearing thin. Clive Crook writes: “The fuss over Bain Capital LLC and outsourcing is unworthy of an intelligent politician.” He continues:
Outsourcing isn’t new, and it isn’t capitalism carried to an unacceptable extreme. It’s part and parcel of the market economy. Companies strive to control costs, which lowers prices and raises real incomes. Buying goods and services from others, at home or abroad, that would cost more to produce for yourself is a good thing. I outsource all building work and car repairs. I’m glad that Apple Inc. outsources the manufacture of its iPads and MacBooks, because it means I can afford them. This isn’t an excess of capitalism. It’s just capitalism. If Bain made money by finding companies where costs could be squeezed and productivity increased, good for Bain. We need more firms like that. In very similar terms, The Post editorial board writes about the Bain assault:
According to the Obama campaign, Mr. Romney’s claim of non-involvement in the fateful three years can’t be squared with some sworn documents he signed that describe him as Bain’s chief after 1999. And that might make him a felon!
If this were a serious charge, as opposed to a political one, Mr. Obama’s minions would report Mr. Romney to the Justice Department. But the charge is not only hyperbolic, it’s derivative — of a previous accusation to the effect that, after 1999, Bain backed some companies that invested, and hired, overseas. This makes Mr. Romney guilty of “outsourcing,” and outsourcing, Mr. Obama insinuates, is bad. . . . But Mr. Obama’s effort to portray Mr. Romney as an evil outsourcer exploits, rather than addresses, [voters’] insecurities. The president knows that the globalization of markets, including the market for labor, is irreversible, which is why he hasn’t proposed policies even remotely commensurate with his campaign’s alarmism.
The president has made himself, the campaign and his liberal spinners seem economically ignorant and ethically challenged. The contrast with th Romney team is noteworthy. Yesterday former New Hampshire governor John Sununu said on a conference call:
The president clearly demonstrated that he has absolutely no idea how the American econ - economy functions. The men and women all over America who - who have worked hard to build these businesses, their businesses, from the ground up is how our economy became the envy of the world. It is the American way. And I wish this president would learn how to be an American.
He later profusely apologized: “I was making the point that in America, entrepreneurs deserve credit and there is an American formula for creating jobs. And I used that phrase three or four times in that call. . . . And instead of saying that he’s got to learn the American formula for creating jobs, I - I did say those words that are there. And, frankly, I made a mistake. I shouldn’t have used those words. And I apologize for using those words.” Good for him.
The Obama team operates with a different set of rules. Call the other guy a felon. Misstate facts about Bain. There is no way to keep up with the accelerating race to the bottom. And Romney shouldn’t try.
Romney can delegate his responses to his VP pick, or more appropriately, a staffer. Or he can simply quote thoughtful observers on the right and left. Trying to ”clear up” what Obama has tried to obfuscate is a fool’s errand. And there has already been a surplus of foolishness in this race.

PHOTOS| Le Diplomate ‘Capital,’ by John Lanchester: London on the eve of the financial collapse
By Ron Charles, E-mail the writer
“Capital,” John Lanchester’s too-big-to-fail novel about the financial crisis, sounds like an opportunity any sharp reader should invest in. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, of course, but this 50-year-old writer has been an illuminating chronicler of capitalism’s seizures.
In the London Review of Books, among other venues, he has written on everything from the global expansion of Kraft Foods to the future of newspapers (please, God). His greatest asset may be that he has no formal economic training. Dedicated to writing for people “who don’t speak finance,” he never assumes we know how a reciprocal currency arrangement should work. Two years ago, he published “I.O.U.: Why Everyone Owes Everyone and No One Can Pay,” which provided a global tour of rapacity and stupidity. Blending brilliant financial reporting with irresistible British wit, it was a profitable merger of Michael Lewis, James Surowiecki and Kingsley Amis. Collateralized debt obligations were never so much fun.
(W.W. Norton) - \"Capital” is John Lanchester’s latest novel. GoingOut

Free admission Get ideas But Lanchester is also an accomplished and daring novelist (his first, “The Debt to Pleasure,” won a Whitbread Book Award), and now he has combined his fiction-writing artistry with a reporter’s expertise to capture the financial biodiversity of London in 2008. From that prospectus, “Capital” seems to be positioning itself as a competitor to Tom Wolfe, even Charles Dickens. The opening chapters rotate through a fantastic variety of characters who live on the same street. The plain houses along Pepys Road were constructed during the late 19th century for middle-class residents, but the 21st-century property boom has raised prices to hysterical levels. “It was like Texas during the oil rush,” Lanchester writes, “except that instead of sticking a hole in the ground to make fossil fuel shoot up from it, all people had to do was sit there and imagine the cash value of their homes rattling upwards so fast that they couldn’t see the figures go round.” As the still-stunned buyer of a tiny house in Bethesda, I was all over this satire like green on cash. In vivid, short chapters, we meet London residents who have no idea that by the end of the year, a bank in New York will collapse and throw the economy into chaos: They’re young and old, whites and blacks, Englishmen and immigrants (legal and illegal). Clusters of characters cohere around each house on the street, from No. 42, owned by an 82-year-old widow getting knocked through modern medical care, to No. 68, where a Pakistani family runs a small shop and tries to avoid association with radical Muslims. There are African meter maids and Polish handymen, beautiful nannies and jealous assistants, lazy relatives and gifted soccer players — the whole vast complex of people rubbing against one another in a big city, and Lanchester seems to know the colorful minutiae of everybody’s business. He swings from deep sympathy for a Zimbabwean refugee waiting for asylum to tart satire of a financier anticipating his bonus. The effect is like one of those cut-away illustrations that show the interior of every room in an apartment complex. But forget the bedrooms. In a market saturated with 50 shades of concupiscence, what additional sexual detail could modern fiction possibly reveal? Lanchester knows that what really piques our curiosity is other people’s money, and in one cascading paragraph after another, he unrolls the grand ledger of our desires. That breathless accounting reaches its climax in his portrayal of the Yount family at 51 Pepys Rd. Richard Yount, a handsome investment banker, thinks nothing of spending 30,000 pounds on a hunting rifle for a weekend outing. He’s still capable of feeling a twinge at the “slightly revolting sign of excess,” but he and his wife, Arabella, can barely keep hold of the fire hose of money spraying from their wallets on country homes, designer clothing and exotic vacations. (What most people pay for a car, Arabella spends to redo the lighting in her dressing room.) It’s all itemized here to the nearest 10,000 pounds, along with the network of personal staff meant to keep Richard and Arabella from ever enduring a moment’s interaction with their young children. Written in a voice that captures the Younts’ blithe egotism, this section is the most delightful response I’ve ever read to those execrable stories about how difficult it is to get by on “just” $250,000 a year. As you can probably tell, there’s a strong populist theme running through Lanchester’s survey of London, a sense that inane distortions at the top of the economic register are ruining life for everyone who actually works for a living by doing something of value. But that lovely liberal ideal crimps the novel’s moral imagination: Its rich people are foolish and extravagant; its poor people are hardworking and ethical. Such a rule does not produce much surprise. Despite his command with the excesses of the period, Lanchester seems unwilling to make us gasp, to confront us with the truly creepy things people will do when cursed by extreme poverty or absurd wealth. The result is a novel that, for all its variety, works from a fairly predictable palette. That’s disappointing because the early sections of the story are so full of spectacular comedy — and menace. Throughout the novel, all the residents of Pepys Road receive increasingly unnerving postcards that say, “We Want What You Have.” Like the anonymous phone calls in Muriel Spark’s “Memento Mori,” these cards accumulate threatening power. Over many chapters, this element of intrigue seems to be laying the basis for some complex and ominous exploration of class envy, but that mystery just peters out. The various story lines become hard to service, and the book’s initial comedy starts to look like your bank’s teaser rate. The bubble of enthusiasm doesn’t so much pop as leak, and by the end, this long story is something of a labor. For an alternative reading investment, buy Adam Haslett’s “Union Atlantic” (2010). It’s still the best novel about the recent financial collapse.

On June 21, Lanchester will be at Politics & Prose bookstore, 5015 Connecticut Ave. NW. Call 202-364-1919 or visit www.politics-prose.com.

Couple shot as they drove on I-95
Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation - A couple was shot when they were driving in this vehicle on I-95.
By Justin Jouvenal, E-mail the writer
A couple was hit with a shotgun blast possibly from a passing vehicle as they were driving a pickup truck on Interstate 95 in the Richmond area in October, the Virginia State Police said this week.
The incident occurred on Oct. 10 around 11:30 p.m. as the Pennsylvania couple’s Chevrolet Silverado was heading southbound near Chippenham Parkway, police said.

An investigation revealed the driver’s side window was shattered by shotgun pellets, which seriously injured the driver, Thomas Doyle, and his passenger, Betty Doyle. Betty Doyle was able to control the pickup and safely bring it to a stop on the shoulder of I-95.At the time of the shooting, the couple were hauling furniture in the Silverado.Both victims were transported to the VCU Medical Center. An analysis of metal fragments retrieved by doctors from one of the victims showed the material was from shotgun pellets.“The evidence that was collected following surgery strongly suggests that this couple was shot at very close range, possibly by a passenger, in a vehicle that was traveling right beside them on Interstate 95,” said Special Agent Angie S. Witt, who is assigned to the Richmond Field Office of the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation.Police said they have no evidence indicating whether the shooting was targeted, or random, or whether it was the result of road rage.The couple did not know which vehicle may have carried the shooter, so the police are asking anyone with information about the shooting to come forward. A reward of $10,000 is being offered by the Doyle family for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.Anyone with any information can contact Special Agent Angie S. Witt at (804) 553-3408 or at angie.witt@vsp.virginia.gov. Get updates on your area delivered via e-mail

Pitfalls ahead for senators’ immigration plan
Video: On Monday, New York's Sen. Chuck Schumer, along with a bipartisan coalition of senators, told reporters they have created a set of principles based upon which they hope lawmakers will pass immigration reform by summer.
By Rosalind S. Helderman and Tara Bahrampour, E-mail the writers
The release of a new bipartisan Senate plan to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws and a policy address expected Tuesday from President Obama have launched dramatic new momentum on a long-stalled issue.
Now the hard part begins.

The blueprint unveiled by senators Monday amid warm bipartisan unity settled some of the most difficult questions that have bedeviled efforts to change immigration laws, particularly by endorsing a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. But it left unanswered dozens of key questions, all of which must be meticulously negotiated in the coming weeks under competing political pressures. And nobody thinks that will be easy.“We still have a long way to go,” Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday, while calling the broad framework a major breakthrough.“A first step in what will continue to be difficult — but achievable,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).The politics for passage are quite treacherous, with a number of key Republicans already labeling this latest iteration of immigration proposals as amnesty for the nation’s 11 million illegal residents. But even before the group of four Democrats and four Republicans can focus on the persistent GOP opposition, they must translate their broad statement of principles on the issue into a detailed bill that can withstand intense legislative scrutiny.That means tackling a number of extremely difficult issues by the end of March, when the group has said it hopes to draft a bill. A bipartisan group is also working on legislation in the House, but most proponents believe legislative action will start in the Democratic-held Senate. For instance, the Senate plan calls for offering illegal immigrants the chance to quickly achieve probationary legal residency, provided they register with the government and pay a fine and back taxes. But it does not outline how large a fine or how long the applicants would have to pay off their taxes.“I think the question is, how broad will the road to citizenship be?” said Ai-Jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance. “We have to make sure that it’s not so expensive and onerous that it doesn’t leave millions of people in limbo for an extended period of time.”More critical to the coming debate is the senators’ requirement that illegal immigrants could not seek a green card — the first step to full citizenship — until the U.S.-Mexican border is secure and other enforcement measures are in place. The measures include a system for employers to verify the legal status of workers and a new way to track legal visa holders.But the framework is silent on how federal officials would certify that the border is secure. It envisions the creation of a commission of governors, attorneys general and others living along the border to “make a recommendation regarding when the bill’s security measure outlined in the legislation are completed.” But it is not clear whether that recommendation would be considered advisory or would by law allow those with probationary status to seek permanent residency.The commission, which would probably include immigration hard-liners elected to statewide office in recent years in Arizona and elsewhere, has already emerged as a potential flash point, making immigrants’ advocates and some Democrats deeply nervous.President Obama is expected Tuesday to unveil his own immigration reform proposal, which would not include such a delay and which otherwise supportive Republicans are warning could sap bipartisan backing for the effort.“All these things must happen before — before — there’s a path to a green card,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) told conservative talk show host Sean Hannity on Fox News on Monday, in one of a series of interviews Rubio has been conducting to sell the senators’ plan to GOP opinion makers. Laura Lichter, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said she was concerned that the proposal placed too much emphasis on border control.She also questioned another key plank the Republicans had required: that illegal immigrants would be sent to the back of the green card line behind those who had legally applied for residency.“It’s really not appropriate to create a group of second-class non-citizens,” she said. “Do people realize how long the lines are? The lines are 10 years and sometimes two decades. Putting someone behind the 30-year line is not going to work.”Another potentially tricky issue is what is known as “future flow” — how many new legal visas to give out and in what fields.On Monday, Schumer called that issue “one of the shoals upon which the good ship ‘Immigration Reform’ has floundered” because it pits big business — which wants access to cheap labor — against the unions, which seek to require businesses to hire Americans. Schumer said the AFL-CIO has been quietly meeting with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to work out an agreement that would link future immigration flow to unemployment rates. But details need to be fleshed out. Dozens of other similar pitfalls abound.The senators call for withholding federal benefits, including Medicare and Medicaid, from illegal immigrants who have met the demands to live and work in the country. But immigrant advocates question how, then, will often low-income immigrants get access to affordable health care?The senators are silent, too, about whether same-sex partners would be eligible for the same benefits as married couples, a divisive question within more socially conservative portions of the immigrant community. Obama will probably call for addressing the issue in his Las Vegas speech.
