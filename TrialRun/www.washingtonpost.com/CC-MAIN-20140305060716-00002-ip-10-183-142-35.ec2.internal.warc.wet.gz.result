PHOTOS| Le Diplomate ‘The Crucible’ hinges on girls’ influence over Salem masses
By Jessica Goldstein, E-mail the writers
The Salem witch trials are a strange, shadowy part of our past: Was that really us, burning those accused of invisible crimes, stringing up suspicious women on trees, hanging them from the branches like Christmas ornaments?
What’s especially bizarre about “The Crucible,” Arthur Miller’s dramatization of that time and place, is that the power lies with girls. They can manipulate the masses; the entire community is like Play-Doh in their small hands. ( Cameron Whitman / ) - Keegan Theatre's production of ‘’The Crucible’’ features a cast with actors as young as 9.

Free admission Get ideas “That’s what’s fascinating about this show: The children are in charge,” said Susan Marie Rhea, who is directing “The Crucible” at Keegan Theatre for the second time. Rhea just returned with her cast from a three-week tour in Ireland. Sarah Lasko, the actress playing the ringleader, Abigail, describes her as “the alpha. . . . She’s so devious and manipulative. . . . She hides behind the innocence and ultimately is this evil person.“What the girls do in this play [is] completely for attention, and it’s also extremely scary. . . . There’s really high stakes at every moment.” Citing the Puritan style of child-rearing — Puritans took to parenting as they took to everything else that occurred outside church: as an unwelcome distraction from prayer — Rhea said, “You can see how the chance to be in charge and have power would have been intoxicating.”The nine girls playing Abigail’s gang range in age from 9 to 17. Rhea acknowledged that working with a younger cast was more time-consuming but said, “There’s something thrilling to me about sitting there and they’re bona fide teenagers. . . . When I see a show done and there are roles that are called for teenagers, and there’s a 25-year-old, it bums me out. In my opinion, it’s worth all the extra hours.”
Keegan Theatre, 1742 Church St. NW. Through Nov. 19. ­www.keegantheatre.com. 703-892-0202.
It’s all in his mind
Artistic Director Ari Roth’s 100th production at Theater J will be Arthur Miller’s “After the Fall.”
Not “Death of a Salesman.” Not “All My Sons.” Not even “A View From the Bridge.”“After the Fall,” which opens Wednesday, is the most cerebral of Miller’s works — cerebral in the literal sense, as in, the entire story unfolds inside the mind of its protagonist, Quentin, as he struggles to find a reason to live in the wake of his second wife’s death.“The critical consensus was very divided on ‘After the Fall,’ ” Roth said. “It was a play that made a deep impression and also made people very wary. . . . It was not a flop or a failure; it was just one of the most challenging.”Roth, though, says he thinks a modern audience will take to the material in a decidedly different manner. When “After the Fall” opened in 1964, audiences deemed the show too intimate — the character of Maggie, an obvious stand-in for Marilyn Monroe, seemed an insensitive portrayal in the aftermath of Monroe’s death. Quentin, a Jewish lawyer tangled in his thoughts, was an unsubtle echo of Miller, who was undergoing psychoanalysis as he wrote the play. “Part of the criticism was that it’s too personal, it’s too indulgent,” Roth said. “Nowadays, there’s nothing that’s too personal, there’s nothing that’s too indulgent.” And 2011 audiences “have distance, perspective and understanding” about the “unsentimental” depiction of the Monroe-inspired character.“It’s a deeply existential play . . . about how to go on in the face of total disillusionment and alienation,” Roth said.“You’ve got characters trying to forge a meaningful life. After two failed marriages, do you have the blind faith to begin again, to marry again? [Miller] argues, it can’t be blind. You have to look at all of your faults and all of the limitations of human beings, and all of their mixed motivations. Looking at all that, then you say: I can begin again.” Theater J, 1529 16th St. NW. Wednesday to Nov. 27. www.theaterj.org. 800-494-8497.
Not your typical grammar school
In Doorway Arts Ensemble’s “Sex and Education,” Joe, the prototypical basketball star, is held hostage by Miss Edwards, an uptight English teacher clocking in her last day on the job. Miss Edwards intercepts a note that Joe tried to pass his girlfriend, Hannah (who, as the Law of High School Relationships requires, is a cheerleader), and Joe must remain in Miss Edwards’s classroom until the note — a profanity-laced effort at persuading Hannah to have sex with him — is grammatically correct. This raises some questions. Why would a prim female educator promote teen sex? Has any woman in the history of intercourse consented to sex only on the grounds her suitor’s request was expressed in perfect English? Didn’t students stop passing notes on paper in 2001? Just . . . go with it. The pleasure in this production stems from the verbal sparring among radically different individuals, characters who shock by speaking deliberately out of character. Playwright Lissa Levin was inspired by her own experience as the mother of a high school athlete; she taught her son, a basketball player utterly uninterested in English class, the parts of speech by speaking like a resident of South Park. (Her lesson began with a simple: “F--- you. What’s the object of the sentence? You.”)Levin describes the play as “a valentine to teachers and a valentine to the importance of English grammar.” The crux of the story lies in “how the wisdom and life experience that comes from [sex] is actually similar to all those things that come from when you’re an educated person.”Miss Edwards sneaks a grammar lesson into a bawdy discussion of sex for the academia-averse athlete like cookbook writer Jessica Se
infeld spikes brownies with spinach for vegetable-phobic children. Although much of the discussion is between Joe (played by Jonathan Douglas) and Miss Edwards (Ellen Mansueto), Hannah (Emily Thompson, in her professional stage debut) makes cameos throughout, shaking her pompoms while chanting a list of auxiliary verbs. Levin hopes the play allows audiences to see language in a new light. “One of the goals of ‘Sex and Education’ was to make grammar sexy.”
Theater 2 in the Cultural Art Center Montgomery College , 7995 Georgia Ave., Silver Spring. Friday to Nov. 20. www.doorwayarts.org. 240-567-5775.

TV Column: Networks’ election-night follies
Donna Svennevik/AP - Diane Sawyer, hosting election night coverage with George Stephanopoulous, appeared tipsy to some viewers.
By Lisa De Moraes, E-mail the writer
NBC News appears to have won election night, ratings-wise. But ABC News was tops on Twitter.
More than 12.1 million viewers watched NBC in prime time, though broadcast numbers would be adjusted Thursday, Nielsen said late Wednesday. That puts NBC ahead of Fox News Channel, which averaged 11.5 million — its biggest prime-time audience ever. More from Lisa de Moraes
Pulitzer Prize winner, Peabody recipient, Medal of Freedom honoree -- Lisa de Moraes is none of these, but she is an authority on the bad direction, over-acting, and muddled plot lines being played out in the TV industry's executive suites. Archive

ABC finished third, snaring 10.5 million. That makes the 9.3 million logged by CNN look pretty good — beating the 7.9 million for CBS, as well as the just less than 5 million garnered by the Fox broadcast network. In a major ratings development, CNN discovered that it eked out a bigger audience than did Fox News Channel, from 7 p.m. Tuesday, when the polls officially closed on the East Coast, until 2 a.m. Wednesday, when President Obama finished delivering his speech. During that time, CNN logged an estimated 8.8 million viewers, compared with FNC’s 8.7 million and 4.6 million for MSNBC. But FNC won the 7 p.m.-to-midnight race. Which suggests that a bunch of FNC viewers did not stick around to watch Obama’s victory speech. But it’s not the TV networks’ numbers people are going to be talking about for the rest of the week. Instead, it’s the crazy coverage of election night across the networks, in comparison to which, Comedy Central’s election-night anchoring by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert looked like Chet Huntley and David Brinkley. FNC, for instance, was the place to go if you wanted to watch political contributor Karl Rove try to hijack a network and get it to un-declare Ohio for Obama about 11:30 p.m. Tuesday. When the FNC “decision desk” stood its ground, senior producers thought of having two members of the number-crunching team go on camera with Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier to discuss. Then someone had a better idea and told Kelly to walk back to the room where the number crunchers were holed up, with camera in tow, and do the interview. Because, New York magazine reported that an FNC “insider” told them, “this is Fox News . . . so anytime there’s a chance to show off Megyn Kelly’s legs they’ll go for it.” So Kelly did. And the number crunchers stood by their call. And they were right. In marked contrast, when ABC News analyst Matt Dowd brought that network’s election-night coverage to its grinding halt, by stating — twice — that this “may be the last election that we see two white men run against each other for president,” ABC election coverage co-anchor George Stephanopoulos opted — after a bit of nervous laughter and cross talk was heard — not to address the jaw-dropping remark: “Matt, I’m going to save you for a sec and go to Jake Tapper in Chicago.” Tapper, to his credit, took a moment from inside Obama headquarters in Chicago to say: “I just want to make sure that everybody is clear on the fact that Barack Obama is not white. Has that been established? . . . I have this breaking-news flash: Barack Obama is African American. If somebody could tell Matt, that’d be great.” How lucky for Dowd, his gaffe got lost in the excitement over Diane Sawyer’s election-night co-anchoring for ABC, which was trending on Twitter that night. Actually, to be accurate, what was trending was speculation as to whether Sawyer was hammered. Someone even created a @DrnkDianeSawyer Twitter account. “Four more beers! Four more beers! The debate over whether Diane Sawyer was drunk last night is high-larious,” tweeted one viewer. “And Diane Sawyer declares tonight’s winner is . . . chardonnay!” chimed in another. Of course, some of the tweets were coming from Sawyer’s competitors: “ABC Diane Sawyer drunk during election coverage?” tweeted Fox News. “Diane Sawyer — Drunk, Tired or Flustered?” faux-questioned TMZ. (TMZ star Harvey Levin also tweeted: “When I watched Diane Sawyer last night something seemed off . . . couldn’t put my finger on it. But watching this AM, toasted!”) “ ‘Drunk’ Diane Sawyer election coverage becomes Twitter hit,” tweeted CTV News. But not just competitors were left scratching their chins over Sawyer’s pixilated performance on election night. She appeared to slur some words, and called Josh Elliott by the name Josh Edwards. When numbers from Minnesota came in, Sawyer said: “We’re ready to project Minnesota. . . . Tonight we know, President Barack Orama — Obama — has won Minnesota.” About 10:45 p.m. Tuesday, Sawyer asked Tapper: “At one point, President Obama’s campaign put an exclamation point after ‘Forward,’ ” referring to Obama’s campaign slogan. “It was just ‘Forward,’ and then it had an exclamation point. When did they decide that was the right message for them?”Tapper and David Muir, at Romney headquarters in Boston, seemed to smirk and try not to smile in split-screen. “Well, they went back and forth about a lot of different messages. And they ultimately decided ‘Forward,’ ” Tapper explained. “And then there was some criticism that ‘Forward’ with just a period was not really conveying the kind of ‘Forward’ that they wanted. So the exclamation point was added.”Then, trying carefully to segue back to the election-night results, he added: “I should say that we’re having somewhat of an exclamation point here this evening. The crowd is really jubilant.” But for network internecine madness, nothing beats NBC on election night. Not long after midnight, anchor Brian Williams began to note the election-night tweeting of NBC “The Apprentice/Celebrity Apprentice” star Donald Trump that, Williams said, was attracting attention. “Donald Trump, who has driven well past the last exit to relevance and something closer to irresponsible here, is tweeting tonight,” Williams began resignedly. He read some of Trump’s tweets, including, “This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy!” and “disgusting injustice. The world is laughing at us!” “So there you have it — THAT happened,” Williams concluded, with a sigh. On Wednesday, Trump responded via Twitter: “Brian — Thanks dummy — I picked up 70,000 twitter followers yesterday alone. Cable News just passed you in the ratings.” To read previous columns by Lisa de Moraes, go to washingtonpost.com/tvblog.

Democrats, Republicans blame each other for FAA shutdown; no end in sight
View Photo Gallery — A congressional dispute has delayed funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, resulting in a partial shutdown. By Ashley Halsey III, E-mail the writer
A dispute over funding for the Federal Aviation Administration has left an estimated 74,000 people out of work for a dozen days and tossed Congress into the throes of yet another interparty battle.
Now, with lawmakers leaving town or already on recess, there seems to be little hope of a resolution on the horizon.

Live chat; 1:30 pm ETShutting down the FAA: Who’s to blame?
Ask now
Lawmakers allowed funding for the FAA to expire July 23, leaving 4,000 agency workers on furlough and 70,000 people in construction-related jobs out of work, possibly until September, when Congress will reconvene.On Wednesday, party leaders blamed each other for the deadlock, and President Obama said Congress had “decided to play politics” and put the the nation’s fragile economic recovery at risk. He said he expects a resolution of the issue by the end of the week.But a handful of furloughed workers discovered that the chances for a quick solution were dim when they trekked to the Capitol and had trouble finding anyone to hear their pleas. The House left town on Monday, and most senators were gone by Wednesday.“We’re staring at a possible six weeks without pay, and they’ll all get nice suntans on their vacations,” said Dan Stefko, a furloughed FAA engineer who flew in from Pittsburgh.“Nobody believed they would actually walk away from this,” added Bob Aitken, an engineer from Chicago, as the group made the rounds, meeting with a handful of lawmakers and staff members.Though the impasse may cost $1.2 billion in lost ticket-tax revenue if it stretches into September, it will have no apparent impact on air travel. Air traffic controllers are remaining on the job.
Unions at heart of dispute
With most of the American public emerging from debt-ceiling-debate overload, the facts of the funding stalemate seemed bewildering. Unlike the debt talks, in which trillions of dollars were in play, the FAA funding has been stalled by matters that hold greater importance to members of Congress than to the majority of the flying public.Primary among them is a partisan split over the rules that govern union efforts to organize airline workers.There have been 20 short-term funding bills for the FAA since September 2007. Even when Democrats controlled both chambers, agreement on long-term funding was elusive. When the Republican-led House passed the 21st extension last month, it tacked on provisions about rural airports intended to cause discomfort for Senate Democrats.This, said House transportation committee Chairman John L. Mica (R-Fla.), was done in the hope that an unpalatable extension might motivate senators to settle the differences between the long-term FAA funding bills passed by the House and the Senate this year.But the Senate balked, demanding a “clean” bill.That brought to the fore the more contentious issue: The House’s long-term funding bill seeks to undo a new rule that makes it easier for unions to organize airline employees.It is on that issue — which is not even included in the House extension bill — that Mica, Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) and other House Republicans are standing fast.Even lawmakers who carried the debate to the Senate floor last week conflated and confused the issues and the different bills, so much so that aides more than once passed slips of paper to them so they could make corrections mid-debate.The wrangling continued Wednesday, sounding like an aftershock of the debt-ceiling negotiations.“Hope is dim at the moment,” said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. “I guess we can always be hopeful, but the light of hope is about ready to flicker out.”
Trading accusations
There was nothing about the demeanor of congressional leaders on Wednesday to suggest that, having taken the nation to the brink of one potential disaster, they were ready to rescue it from another crisis.“The only reason so many jobs are at stake is Senate Democratic leaders chose to play politics rather than pass the House bill,” Boehner said.“This is their modus operandi,” Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) fired back at Republicans. “Government by crisis that they make up, government by hostage-taking, government by threat.”Senate Democrats insisted that the House pass a funding extension free of any additional provisions, saying privately that they if they agreed to pass the current extension, it would embolden the House to repeat the process when that bill expired next month.House Republicans say the Senate should pass the extension and negotiate with greater purpose on resolving the long-term funding bills. The Democrats counter that the House has yet to appoint a conference committee to reconcile the bills, leaving things primarily to staff members.Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said that congressional leaders “could take care of this in a second” because both chambers will meet in pro forma session in the coming weeks — meaning that while most lawmakers are back in their home states, leaders could act on an FAA bill.
‘Embarrassingly easy’
But the rhetoric Wednesday did not suggest that option was in the offing.Senate commerce committee Chairman John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), one of the key combatants, lamented Wednesday that the issue is “embarrassingly easy” to solve.“It’s shamefully easy,” he said, calling for the House to pass a “clean” funding extension.But Mica said that “Senate Democrats have no one to blame but themselves for this partial shutdown of FAA programs and airport projects.”“There are no labor provisions in the House-passed extension,” Mica said. But in the long-term bills, “there are a number of unresolved issues in negotiations with the Senate, including the . . . labor provision. We have been willing to compromise, willing to negotiate, find common ground.”He accused “powerful Senate Democrats” of “bludgeoning folks who disagree with them.”Mica on Wednesday also heard the wrath of the man who sits next to him on the House transportation committee, ranking Democrat Nick J. Rahall II (W.Va.).“House Republican leaders had the ability to end this shutdown but refused to budge from their stubborn ‘my way or the runway’ approach to negotiating,” Rahall said. “Instead of coming together to seek a solution, they attached a policy rider to the FAA extension bill to try to force the Senate to adopt its anti-worker agenda. Forcing the FAA to shut down to score a few political points for tea party extremists comes at a great cost to American jobs and our economy.”Mike MacDonald, and FAA engineer who flew in from Boston to confront Congress, said he didn’t have to choose which party to blame.“We blame the whole institution of Congress that has failed us,” he said.
