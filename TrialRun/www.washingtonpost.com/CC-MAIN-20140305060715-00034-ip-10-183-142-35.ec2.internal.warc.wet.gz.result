By Catherine Ho
Capital Business recently hosted a roundtable with several chief legal officers to discuss the challenges their departments are facing. Here are excerpts from that conversation: (All photos by Jeffrey MacMillan)
“Five to 10 years ago, costs were out of control because they weren’t being managed. I don’t know if a lot of companies back then managed their legal fees like they do [now] ... If you know more, and you’re more efficient, you use outside counsel less. So we do a lot of shared services work, HR work and small contracting rather than use outside counsel.” “We’re willing to take on more risk because we need to bring in business. You need to be aggressive and get that business or there isn’t a future. You can have a safe approach and no business. Or you can take on more risk.”
“Many rogue Web sites are selling our software. Consumers are calling in all the time trying to return pirated software. It’s been a huge issue for my team. What keeps me up at night is the customer confusion created ... that’s why we’ve been trying to move toward the cloud. I built an enforcement team of three full-time anti-piracy professionals [non-lawyers with background in IT and software development].”
“It’s not just about getting a discount, it’s about a partnership ... A willingness to work with me on alternative fee arrangements, and transparency on fees.” “Part of my outside spend is sheer overflow — I can’t do it all. I’ve hired [a second attorney] to reduce outside counsel spend. We’ve started doing more preventative lawyering, going out to our community of scholars and people who support scholars, and educating them on basic things like, ‘What’s a contract and why does it have to be in writing?’”
“We’ve been facing and will continue to face an increasing volume of regulations designed to keep government contractors clean, honest, efficient and as inexpensive as possible ... In this coming year, I continue to devote an extraordinary amount of time to understanding and implementing the new laws and regulations governing contractors.”

Rick Perry drops out of race, contradicting credulous commentators
By Erik Wemple
Who saw through this guy’s act?
(Charles Krupa - Associated Press)
Rick Perry is dropping out of the presidential race. Pundits will break down the reasons for you: bad debate performances, gaffes, lameness on questions of foreign policy, and so on. Pundits will also break down the implications of his withdrawal: Will it really help Newt Gingrich? Will it help to crystallize the much-talked-about far-right challenge to Mitt Romney?
Well, perhaps you shouldn’t listen to those analyses, especially as they relate to the Texas governor. After all, behold what various pundits were saying about Perry after his debut performance on the debate platform, on Sept. 7.
Each pundit remark is followed by a Credulity Count, with “10” signifying complete purchase of conventional Rick Perry wisdom and “1” signifying actual wisdom.
Chris Matthews of MSNBC: And ‘Let Me Finish’ tonight with why I’ve begun to betting — or actually, have begun to bet now it`s going to be Rick Perry as the Republican nominee against President Obama. . . . I think, right now, it`s Rick Perry. With all its successes, he has the gut of the Republican right. He has the anger, the contempt, the deep feelings of animosity that’s out there in the country right now. You get the sense he feels what he speaks, long before he speaks it. He’s out there on the stump seething with contempt for Washington.
Credulity Count: 8.5. Matthews didn’t consider that Perry needs to think about what he speaks, long before he speaks it. Mike Allen of Politico
: After last night’s feisty duel at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, GOP nomination is a two-man race between Rick Perry and Mitt Romney. . . . Rick Perry is real — not a bubble. He showed huge vulnerabilities with some answers but will be a ferocious and durable competitor. If I’m Mitt Romney, I wonder if my team should spend millions, IMMEDIATELY, defining this guy before he can define himself.
Credulity Count: 7.75. “Rick Perry is real — not a bubble”: Allen was close to the mark with that analysis; he had all the right words, just didn’t put them in the right place, as in: “Rick Perry is a bubble, not real.” Ezra Klein of Washington Post: Mitt Romney looked like he had already won the Republican nomination. Rick Perry looked like he will win the Republican nomination. Michele Bachmann looked like she was beginning to realize she definitely wouldn’t win the Republican nomination.
Credulity Count: 5. Two out of three!
Don Imus of Oblivion, Inc.: Rick Perry. So that’s my guy now. Rick and Mitt.
Credulity Count: n/a
Joe Scarborough of MSNBC: I think Rick Perry’s biggest problem is going to be the Social Security issue. He keeps calling it a Ponzi scheme. Now if you want to say Social Security’s a Ponzi scheme and this is what we need to do to fix it, that’s fine. But he doesn’t do that. He says it’s a Ponzi scheme, it’s a lie.
Credulity Count: 4. Perry only wishes that his position on Social Security had been his biggest problem.
Andrea Mitchell of NBC News: It is a two-man race perhaps for tonight, for this week, but we see this thing evolve, we don’t know. Rick Perry is a very controversial candidate. Let’s see how he holds up.
Credulity Count: 2.75. Prophetic! Careful! Skeptical! Journalistic! Refreshing. Karl Rove of Fox News: Well, look, I, I think we don’t know yet. I, I love how we’re trying to come to a, you know, to a conclusion at the beginning of the process. Who’s really, tonight that’s gonna be taking the front of the Republican presidential sweepstakes to a new level? I remind you at, at, at this point four years ago, it was a two-man race as well. Thirty percent of Republican primary voters supported Rudy Giuliani and 27 percent supported — former Senator Fred Thompson. So, I mean that we are still relatively early in the process. We’ve got five months until people start voting and all kinds of things can and will happen.
Credulity Count: 1.25. Thanks, Karl. By	Erik Wemple

Does Yu Darvish’s contract change things for Prince Fielder?
By Adam Kilgore
The Texas Rangers and Japanese superstar right-handed pitcher Yu Darvish reached an agreement for a six-year contract this evening, reportedly worth $60 million. Combined with the $51.7 million the Rangers bid through the posting system in order to win the rights to negotiate with Darvish, Texas paid more than $111 million to acquire him. The ripple effect for the Nationals comes in relation to Prince Fielder. With the Darvish negotiation settled, the Rangers can fully turn their focus to their approach to Fielder, which should give agent Scott Boras at least a small amount of leverage with his talks with Nationals ownership regarding Fielder, the elite slugging first baseman who has remained in free agency longer than many imagined. The popular thinking has been that Darvish’s negotiations would determine the Rangers’ stance toward Fielder. But does that really make any sense? Does the completion of Darvish’s deal have an effect on Fielder?
The Rangers’ front office surely bid on Darvish knowing full well what it would take to sign him, and with the intent of doing so. They surely budgeted that money into their offseason plan. In other words: They have surely known all along whether they wanted to, and could, make a play for Fielder as well. And it sure seems like they will, seeing how Fielder met with Rangers representatives at a Dallas-area hotel over the weekend. Rangers president Nolan Ryan called the meeting “preliminary,” and speculation has still suggested the Rangers could most likely sign either Darvish or Fielder. It seems to me that the Rangers already know whether they can afford to sign both, even if that means getting creative with a proposal to Fielder. If they couldn’t, why would they have wasted their time visiting him? Maybe I’m reading this all wrong, and the meeting with Fielder was intended by the Rangers to send some kind of negotiating message to Darvish’s side. (Or maybe it was intended by Scott Boras as some kind negotiating message to the Nationals.) But it seems like the Rangers, with their overflowing TV money and hitter-haven ballpark, are a serious threat to land both the best pitcher ever to come out of Japan and the best free agent available.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Gifts and pocket fillers on the campaign trail
View Photo Gallery — Patriotic glasses, candidate cutouts, and buttons and signs galore: Voters attend the GOP presidential contenders’ events with hard-to-miss tokens of support. By David A. Fahrenthold, E-mail the writer
LAS VEGAS — A pair of hand-knit slippers, adorned with a Mormon symbol. Rosary beads. A tiny stack of yard signs. An autographed Ron Paul placard.
Nevada had its strange moment in the political spotlight this week, as stage-managed campaigns roared through with rallies and TV ads. This was faux intimacy, done in a city where faux is a fact of life: The casinos are named after Paris and New York, and the dust-dry streets around them are named, aspirationally, for trees and oceans.

GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich criticized rival Mitt Romney's comment that he was, \"Not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there.\" In Las Vegas, Gingrich touted his own plan to put the unemployed to work. (Feb. 2) More on this Story

But, carried in pockets and purses, there were small signs that it wasn’t all fake. People on the campaign trail carried little items and objects for the candidates to touch or take home — teddy bears, rosaries, a skateboard painted with Rep. Ron Paul’s face. In these things were clues to the Great Unspokens that all Nevada’s political stagecraft was supposed to either obscure or exploit. Mitt Romney’s sway over the state’s Mormon voters. Newt Gingrich’s unraveling organization. Rick Santorum’s family pain.And, among the voters, a lingering hope that there might still be something personal and intimate left in this process of choosing a president of 300 million Americans.“I want him to remember me,” said Bertha Brandau, 77, after she’d pressed her hand-knit slippers into the hands of a surprised Mitt Romney on Wednesday night in Las Vegas. “His feet are going to get cold, back East.”
ROMNEY
At a Romney rally on Wednesday night, people clutched the things they’d been given on the way in. Everybody got a big Romney sign for the living-room window. An instruction sheet: “How to Caucus in Nevada.” A small American flag. The hyper-organized Romney campaign had provided all of these props — and instructions on when to use them. “If you’ve got flags and signs, this would be the song to raise them,” said a singer who warmed up the crowd for Romney, leaving nothing to chance.When Romney came out, he plowed through his standard stump speech, including the big applause line about how President Obama had said he’d be a one-term president if he couldn’t fix the economy. Romney said nothing specific that was tailored to Nevada’s Mormon population. In 2008, Mormons made up a quarter of Nevada’s caucus voters, and 95 percent voted for Romney, who is also Mormon.But then, just as Romney was leaving the stage, he met Brandau — a fellow church member, too excited to play it cool. She was a retired nurse (“If you ever need an enema, let me know,” she said to a reporter later, instead of “goodbye.”). She had guessed that Romney wore a size 11.5. On the slippers themselves, she had knitted a beehive — a symbol of the Mormon church and of Utah.“I said, ‘These are your beehive slippers.’ Oh, he smiled and hugged me,” Brandau said. “And I kissed him on the side of his face.”As Romney left the stage, then, he wore what he often wears — a blue shirt and blue suit jacket, with an American flag on the lapel. A uniform designed not to stand out. And, in his hands, he carried a pair of bright-colored slippers, adorned with black-and-yellow beehives. PAUL
At a rally held by Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) on Tuesday night in a casino ballroom, people brought tricornered hats and handmade signs (”Will work for freedom!”). One 23-year-old Army vet who admired Paul’s minimalist foreign policy ideas waived a skateboard, adorned with Paul’s smiling face. In another corner of the crowd, James Skeary had brought his own totem: a 2008 Ron Paul for President sign, autographed by the candidate himself. “I think he believes like I do, that the government should not own your labor,” said Skeary, a stout and strong man with a beard that traced his chin line. In particular, Skeary said, he agreed with Paul’s criticisms of the federal income tax system.For five recent years, Skeary said, he simply declined to pay federal income tax — believing that the law did not actually require it. “Now, I’ve got somebody that I can believe in,” Skeary said. Skeary is a painter who works on construction projects. During Vegas’s building slump, he was without work for more than a year. But he finally started a new job last week.“It’s a government job,” he said. Building a new Veterans Administration hospital. Skeary said he didn’t see a problem with this. “I’m okay. If it was the IRS, I’d still say no.”
GINGRICH
Gingrich, the candidate himself, usually wears a small lapel pin — blue with white stars, the battle flag of Gen. George Washington. And he carries a famously overstuffed wallet, crammed with a profusion of family photos and other papers.Here, it’s possible to know the man by the contents of his suit: highly confident. Mindful of history. And struggling to maintain order in his own world.In a small tea-room on the outskirts of Las Vegas, that last quality was the one troubling Gingrich supporter Don Dolan. Dolan had been impressed by Gingrich’s past success as House Speaker. “Gingrich, to me, is almost like a modern-day Jefferson. He’s thought through all these issues,” Dolan said. “He’s got a decision before the question is asked.”But, when Dolan couldn’t get help from the candidate’s disorganized, understaffed Nevada campaign. So he advertised online for his own event for Las Vegas supporters.Out of a city of 583,000, 11 people came. And Dolan didn’t even have enough “Newt” yard signs to go around: He came in carrying just nine.“It’s all we could get,” Dolan told them. “They’re few and far between in Nevada.”Dolan, a former military man who has let his red hair grow long in retirement, taught the group about the complexities of the state’s caucuses. They would arrive at precinct sites, give speeches about Gingrich (Dolan had printed out talking points) and then vote. “Has anybody else been to training for caucuses” before this? Dolan asked, finally. Nobody had. By the end of his meeting, Dolan was thinking about what might have been. A few more yard signs. A few of those big signs to put out by the highway. Just think.“Really, I mean, what can we do?” Dolan said, looking at reality again. “This is all we’ve got.”
SANTORUM
At Santorum’s rallies in Nevada, much of what people brought him was meant for his three-year-old daughter, Bella. She was born with a rare genetic disorder and was recovering back home from a frightening bout with pneumonia.People gave Santorum a teddy bear that shouted “I love you!” when you squeezed it. A framed picture of a saint. And rosary beads. Santorum always takes the beads home, where he’s often in need of new ones. “They’re always breaking,” he says, when he uses them. Not made like they used to be.Tuesday was a very bad day for Santorum, when he was trounced in Florida and arrived in Nevada to find only small crowds waiting for him. “Senator Santorum ... is running for President of the United States,” said the woman who introduced him. Slowly, like people might be hearing this for the first time.On this day, Santorum was carrying some of his usual candidate accessories. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. A snap-shut makeup compact.“She is doing just great!” Santorum was saying to a TV camera that night, talking to Fox News Channel’s Greta Van Susteren after checking himself in the compact’s mirror. “She had a very rough go of it.”And he was carrying very personal reminders of the family he’d left behind. An iPhone, for the photos his wife sends of Bella. A tiny silver angel on his lapel to remind Santorum of his son Gabriel, who died shortly after birth in 1996.“I have an angel on my shoulder,” Santorum said, and there was a hint of breaking in his voice.Santorum was also carrying something unintended, and invisible. His nose was running. After spending time at his ill daughter’s bedside, Santorum thought he had caught some of her germs. So he carried a wadded, used tissue, along with everything else. Hopefully, the candidate said, it was just a little cold.

Of all the vital questions facing our nation in these post- election weeks, the most vexing may be, "How do I know when my turkey is done?"
This would seem to be a simple question to answer, because almost every food publication in the country is referring its readers this week to a chart showing that if your turkey weighs X pounds it should be done after Y hours in a Z-degree oven. (The Post sends people to the one at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Lets_Talk_Turkey/index.asp.)
The label on the turkey tells you the value of X, and your clock tells you the value of Y, but nobody ever questions the value of Z. We blithely set our ovens for a certain temperature and figure that's the temperature we will get. But shouldn't we be a bit more agnostic, as scientists are when taking measurements? When you set your oven for, say, 325 degrees, does it really heat up to 325 degrees?
I know you're already anxious about your turkey and don't need anything new to worry about. Well, I never worried about the Z factor either until a few weeks ago, when my wife was baking pumpkin pies. The pies just wouldn't cook in the expected amount of time; their crusts remained soft and the custard hadn't firmed up. Thinking there might be a glitch in the recipe, she made another batch, with the same result. That's when she called in the sage of all things chemical or physical, the solver of all problems (me).
"Let's check the oven temperature," I said.
I set the oven for several different temperatures, allowing time for it to reach each one, and measured them with an oven thermometer. (Those cheap little metallic ones that you hang on the oven rack are just fine, and you have plenty of time to buy one before the Big Day.) My actual oven temperatures averaged 22 degrees lower than their settings. I wondered why.
Summoning my finely honed powers of scientific observation, I noticed that there was a 14-by-16-inch slab of stone resting on the bottom shelf of the oven. It was our baking stone, also known as a pizza stone, which we leave in the oven after using it because it's just too darned heavy to be schlepped in and out.
"Aha!" I said ("eureka" having been vastly overused). "The stone is casting an infrared shadow."
"Huh?" my wife inquired.
"You see, electric elements heat the oven mainly by infrared radiation, which travels in straight lines. That slab of stone is shielding the middle of the oven from the heating element at the bottom and preventing it from reaching the set temperature."
"Yeah, right," she said. "Just fix it, okay?"
I removed the stone and tested the temperatures again, and all the Z's were right on the button.

For years, federal regulators have cast Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a potential threat to the financial system -- dangerously large, lacking in regulatory restraints and consumed with enriching themselves.
This Story'My House. My Dream. It Was All an Illusion.'Fannie, Freddie Shares Soar After Restraints Loosened
This week, regulators embraced the two federally chartered companies as potential saviors and gave them license to do business with even looser restraints. Facing a deepening crisis, the government gave Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac authority to operate with thinner financial cushions, which could increase their mortgage-related investments by a combined $200 billion.
How much the government's action will help borrowers remains to be seen, but already the benefit to the companies has been dramatic. Share prices for each firm have risen by more than half since Monday, reversing weeks of precipitous decline.
Investors' reactions reflected more than just the economics of this week's announcement. Wall Street interpreted the action as evidence that the government has changed its attitude toward the companies in a way that will protect their franchise for years to come, analysts said.
Until the announcement, "it was North Korea, Fannie Mae, Iran -- the enemies," analyst Gary Gordon of Portales Partners said, caricaturing the Bush administration's view of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. "Now all of a sudden they're recognizing that the latent benefit of Fannie and Freddie was that they were backup buyers when other investors weren't buying."
It was easier for the government to ignore the potential value of backup buyers when the housing bubble was growing and there was no shortage of demand for mortgage-related investments.
The administration's reversal on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mae "will set a precedent that will last for a long time," said Kenneth Posner, who follows the companies for Morgan Stanley.
While the government chartered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to promote homeownership and a stable mortgage system, the companies are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and serve shareholders as well as the public.
The companies have two main businesses. They package mortgages into securities for sale to investors, guaranteeing to pay the investors if the borrowers default. They also buy mortgages and mortgage-backed securities for their own investment portfolios, thereby giving lenders money to make more loans.
Largely because investors assume the government would bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if they got in trouble, the companies are able to borrow cheaply to finance their investments. For the same reason, the securities they guarantee historically have commanded a premium price. (On Wall Street, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities are known as "agency securities," though the companies are not government agencies.)
In essence, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac profit by monetizing their unusual status as government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs.
The companies are imperfect instruments of public policy because their economic interests often conflict with their public mission. For example, funding mortgages for people with low incomes and poor credit histories or bailing out subprime borrowers facing imminent foreclosure may not be the most fiscally prudent use of their resources.

LaKeisha Eaddy (River Hill) Temple, G, Jr.
Season: The 5-foot-6 Eaddy led the Atlantic 10 in assists and steals and averages 11.4 ppg.
Fact: Named second-team all-conference and to the A-10's all-defensive team.
Best high school basketball memory: "Winning the state championship my senior year. I just remember at the buzzer just feeling overwhelmed about the whole experience because after four years, we finally had won." The win over Western capped a 28-0 season.
Favorite high school gym other than my own: "Mount Hebron, because they were one of our rivals. Having people cheer against you motivates you as a player to want to shut the crowd up."
Best piece of advice in high school: "Everything [that Coach Teresa Waters] told me has been great advice and something I carry with me. You always remember her famous little quotes like, 'Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.' "
Best player I faced in high school: "Wanisha Smith at Riverdale Baptist was a big guard, and she also had a post-up game, three-point shot, inside-outside."
High school loss that stings the most: "Definitely Milford Mill my junior year, the game to get to the state championship. I recall the second half, being up by about 15 points and letting it all slip away." Milford Mill, after trailing 45-30 in the third quarter, won 68-59 to hand River Hill its only loss of the season.
Advice for high school players: "Start to learn how to organize your time, because once you get [to college], it's all about time management."
Best thing about college basketball: "You're with your teammates more. It's more of a family environment than high school."
Worst thing about college basketball: "The college coaches are definitely tougher, and they take basketball to heart because this is their life and what they breathe daily."
When I hear the words "March Madness," I think: "College sports. Big games. Sweet 16."
Ashley Spriggs (Bishop McNamara) Charlotte, F, Jr.
Season: Second on the team in assists, third in rebounding and sixth in scoring.

A procedural problem is threatening to derail a landmark food safety measure passed by the Senate on Tuesday, sending congressional leaders scrambling to figure out a way to get the bill enacted into law by the end of the lame-duck session this month.
The legislation, which would give vast new authority to the Food and Drug Administration and is designed to reduce nationwide outbreaks of food-borne illness, has wide public support. The House passed a more stringent version more than a year ago, and before House leaders knew about the procedural problem, they indicated the House would accept the Senate version. President Obama has said he would sign the bill into law.
But after the Senate approved the measure, 73 to 25, staffers learned one section could violate a constitutional provision that calls for any new taxes to originate in the House rather than the Senate.
The section in question would impose fees on importers, and on farmers and food processors whose food is recalled because of contamination. If it is determined that those fees amount to taxes, it would essentially nullify the vote by the Senate. The House Ways and Means Committee decides whether the fees are equivalent to taxes.
House leaders met behind closed doors Wednesday seeking a way to save the bill.
Afterward, Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) voiced frustration to reporters. "This has happened to us four or five times with the Senate," Hoyer said. "The Senate knows this rule and should follow this rule. They should be cognizant of the rule. Nobody ought to be surprised by this rule. It's in the Constitution. And they've all been lectured, and we have as well, about reading the Constitution."
Several parliamentary maneuvers could get the bill back on track, but nearly all would require the Senate to take another vote on the bill. That is a challenging proposition given the Senate's compressed agenda for the remaining four weeks, which includes passing a continuing resolution to fund the federal government and taking up a measure to extend the Bush-era tax cuts.
Senate Republicans complicated that scenario Wednesday by sending a letter to Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) in which they promised to block any legislation in the lame-duck session that does not extend tax cuts or fund the government.
