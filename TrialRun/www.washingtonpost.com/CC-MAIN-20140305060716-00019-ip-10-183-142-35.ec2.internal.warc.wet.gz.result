Should we take Obama at his word?
By Jennifer Rubin
The debate between pundits as to whether President Obama would go left or right in a second term is the perfect sort of political debate; Neither side really knows if it is right. And, of course, if Obama loses, no one risks being proven wrong.
I’ve made the case he’d go left; others disagree. (Interestingly, most liberals are saying he’ll go right, and conservatives say the reverse.). And whether he’ll have a compliant or obstructionist Congress is anyone’s guess. Obama perpetuates the mystery by not having any specific second-term agenda to speak of.
But here is the thing: He
is telling his supporters he is going to fulfill his original agenda, not tack to the center or work to compromise with conservatives. He likes to tell crowds these days that he needs a second term to finish “what we started.”
Last month he told the faithful in Chicago:
It is time for us to take the money we are no longer spending at war and use half of that to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building here at home. Let’s put people back to work. And we need to make sure that we’ve got a tax system that reflects everybody doing their fair share. . . . [R]remember what we said in the last campaign, that real change, big change would be hard. It takes time. It may take more than a single term. It may take more than a single President. . . .
And if you’re willing to keep pushing through the obstacles and reach for that vision of America that we all believe in, I promise you change will continue to come. And if you work as hard as you did then, now, I promise you we will finish what we started in 2008, and we will remind the world just why it is that America is the greatest nation on Earth. He is talking about more and more government. (No matter is too inconsequential or nonessential to demand federal action: “ We get faster Internet to rural Illinois, rural America, so that some store owner or entrepreneur there can suddenly have access to a worldwide marketplace — that’s good for the entire economy.”) He is omitting any mention of debt or entitlement reform. He is tying to convince his side that they will get what they couldn’t the first time. Cap-and-trade, anyone? Expiration of the George W. Bush tax cuts, for certain. Slash defense? Yup.
This puts the president’s supporters in a quandary. If he really is looking to be moderate and play ball with Republicans in a second term, than he is simply lying to his side. If he is telling his side what he really believes, he’s not moderating one bit. What he started in his first term when he had majorities on both houses of Congress was an agenda focused on going after business rhetorically and legislatively, injecting the federal government into many sectors of the economy, putting more Americans on the government rolls (e.g., Medicaid) and getting through as much of the left’s to-do list as possible (e.g., the stimulus). Remember the administration’s watchwords: Never let a crisis go to waste. Unlike the president’s defenders, I choose to think he’s not lying to his supporters. He wants to get what he couldn’t in his first term. And if that reality has to be fudged or disguised in some way, it is probably because it is not an agenda that is acceptable to the 2012 electorate.

More groups join Maryland’s costly campaign on expanded gambling
By John Wagner, E-mail the writer
Three new ballot-issue committees have emerged in the closing weeks of Maryland’s costly fight over expanded gambling, channeling another $2.2 million into attempts to sway voters to support Question 7.
The efforts of the newcomers are narrower than those of the two main committees, which largely have been funded by gambling companies with a big stake in the outcome. MGM Resorts has now given close to $30 million to advocate passage of the measure, while Penn National Gaming has ponied up more than $41 million to oppose it.

More news about Md. politics
The newest committee to register is called the Republican Leaders Referendum Guide. The only funding reported by the group is $271,515 from the Peterson Cos., the developer of National Harbor.Question 7 would allow a new casino in Prince George’s County, and National Harbor is considered the most likely site. Peterson also has contributed $1.7 million to the committee backed by MGM, which is angling to build the casino at Peterson’s development.Besides advocating for Question 7, the Republican Leaders committee also has registered to campaign for defeat of some other high-profile measures on Tuesday’s ballot in Maryland: same-sex marriage, in-state tuition for undocumented students and the state’s new congressional map.Literature distributed by the group features pictures of former lieutenant governor Michael Steele and activist and politician Audrey Scott, two well-known Maryland Republicans whose endorsements of Question 7 were touted a couple of weeks ago by the MGM-funded ballot-issue committee, known as For Maryland Jobs and Schools.Angela Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the Peterson Cos., said Steele and Scott have been “very helpful in getting out our positive message that voting for Question 7 is not only good for Prince George’s County but also good for the entire state.”The new campaign committee “provides a way for us to support the efforts of these Republican leaders,” Sweeney said.She said that the Peterson Cos. does not have any official positions on the other ballot measures besides Question 7.Another new ballot committee is advocating for passage of Question 7, as well as all the other statewide measures confronting Maryland voters. That group, called Forward Maryland, has been sending out direct mail and plans to hand out literature to voters at the polls. Its treasurer is Isaac Salazar, a former Maryland Democratic Party staffer.Forward Maryland has reported raising $1 million, all of it from donors with a stake in the state’s expanded gambling measure.The largest contribution is from For Maryland Jobs and Schools, the MGM-funded committee, which has given $650,000.Another $250,000 has come from a group that includes Caesars Entertainment, which plans to open a casino in downtown Baltimore in 2014. Besides authorizing a new casino, Question 7 also would allow table games, such as black jack and roulette, at Maryland’s five previously designated slots sites, including Baltimore. The same group also has given $4.6 million to the MGM-led committee.Willard Hackerman, the president and chief executive of Whiting-Turner Contracting Co., has contributed $100,000 to Forward Maryland. Caesars announced in September that it had picked Whiting-Turner to build its casino.Another relative newcomer to the gambling fight is a ballot-issue committee led by former Prince George’s county executive Wayne K. Curry. His committee, which has received previous media coverage, has raised nearly $1 million for what Curry has described as grass-roots efforts to build support for a Prince George’s casino.The Peterson Cos. has kicked in $700,000 to Curry’s committee. Gaylord Entertainment, which owns the largest hotel at National Harbor, has given $250,000.In the past week, a labor union also has registered to make independent expenditures in the gambling fight. UNITE Here, which bills itself as the largest union of gaming workers in the world, reports having spent more than $50,000 advocating for Question 7. Reprints
