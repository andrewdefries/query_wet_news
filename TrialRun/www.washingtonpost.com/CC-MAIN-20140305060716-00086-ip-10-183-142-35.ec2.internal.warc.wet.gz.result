Path to the nomination
By Jennifer Rubin
Mitt Romney has the opportunity to all but lock up the nomination with wins in a batch of Super Tuesday states today. He is now leading in most polls in Ohio and is expected to cruise to easy wins in Vermont, Massachusetts, North Dakota and Idaho. It is even possible he may take Tennessee. That would leave Georgia to Newt Gingrich, Alaska to Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) and Oklahoma to the struggling Rick Santorum.
But it is clear that Ohio is at the center of Romney’ effort to put the race away. He was there all day on Monday, making his final case on a focused economic message. In Canton he told the crowd: “I see a lot of folks all talking about lots of things. But what we need to talk about to defeat Barack Obama is getting good jobs and scaling down the size of government.” Given Santorum’s failure to qualify for a full slate of delegates, Romney zeroed in on his opponent’s error. As Politico reported, “With stops here, in Canton and a planned evening rally in Zanesville, Romney on Monday hit cities in congressional districts where rival Rick Santorum failed to submit full delegate slates for Tuesday’s Ohio primary.”
Santorum isn’t waiting for the ballots to be counted before spinning the results. His senior adviser is already trying to say losses in key races don’t matter, whining once again about the money his opponent is using to roll over him:
Despite the snide confidence of Santorum’s flack, it will be impossible for Santorum to pretend Romney isn’t the front-runner if he wins most of the races today. A Romney adviser wasn’t impressed with the spin. He cracked to me last night, “Santorum has made a practice of spinning his losses, be they debates or states. Now he is expanding the practice to a pre-spin of why he will lose. I guess they wanted to get ahead of this process.”
If the races play out as expected, the race in retrospect would take on a different complexion. The triple wins for Santorum on Missouri, Minnesota and Colorado on Feb. 28 would then be an aberration in states with high concentrations of religious conservatives and where turnout was low and Romney put forth limited effort. Romney’s march to the nomination would look more like a relatively strong effort with comparatively few losses than the serial failure of a “weak” candidate to connect with the base. And, in fact, with the advantage of hindsight, we can see that much of the analysis and pundits’ tropes look silly. Romney didn’t have a “25 percent cap” on support, as many pundits repeated. He wasn’t unable to win the base; it simply took a while. His “too negative” campaign turns out to have produced voluminous and very conservative policies on taxes, spending, jobs, entitlements and national security. And the candidate who seemed too stiff or genteel to win in a street fight took out a series of contenders with methodical ruthlessness. The more his opponents complained about the attacks, the more it seemed that he had the kind of steel spine needed to stand up to the Obama attack machine. And he did this while a conservative media overwhelmingly rooted for each and every rival, only reluctantly vetting them or daring to criticize. The primary process isn’t over. But if Romney comes out of Super Tuesday with the lion’s share of the votes, he’ll be the presumptive nominee. The race already has had the familiar impact on the front-runner: He looks more confident and, yes, more presidential than his opponents. He has big challenges ahead that include unifying the GOP, focusing his economic message in a way that accounts for positive developments in the economy and making the case that on everything from Iran to the debt to entitlement reform Obama has shrunk from the challenges of the day. Still, those who consider the GOP’s goose already cooked should perk up. We are months before the election. Unemployment is still high, the debt ceiling is likely to be reached again and Obama is essentially trying to run out the clock by doing nothing this year. He has plenty of vulnerabilities. I share my colleague Michael Gerson’s take that “confident predictions of Romney’s defeat are not only premature. They are seriously frivolous.” While conservatives (many of whom rooted against Romney throughout) like to dwell on his weaknesses, in their more lucid moments they also recognize that Obama of 2012 is not the Obama of 2008 who needed to present a blank slate to the public, capi­tal­ize on a financial meltdown and merely stand thoughtfully while his opponent ran around breathlessly (shutting down and starting up his campaign was truly a low point, you may recall in the McCain follies). This time around, voters know he’s a liberal; it is he who must defend a shaky economic record, and his opponent will appear forceful, calm and entirely credible as a replacement. Throw in an exciting VP pick and the Romney-Christie or Romney-Rubio ticket looks solid.
And if Romney’s take down of Santorum in the last debate or his willingness to open up about his personal life is any indication, he is a candidate who can learn and adjust. He should not be underestimated. By	Jennifer Rubin

A Syrian defector’s mission
By David Ignatius, PARIS
Syria’s most prominent military defector says the key to political transition there is to provide a “safety net” that convinces Alawites they won’t be massacred if they break with President Bashar al-Assad. David Ignatius
Ignatius writes a twice-a-week foreign affairs column and contributes to the PostPartisan blog.

Role-playing
“My main work is to convince the Alawites that they do not have to commit suicide along with the regime,” said Manaf Tlass, a former general in the Syrian army who left the country in July. He spoke Tuesday at a location in France, where he has taken refuge. It was his first in-depth interview since he broke with Assad, who was once his close friend. Tlass said that before there can be a political transition, there must first be a channel of trust between the opposition Free Syrian Army and reconcilable members of the military who are ready to break with Assad as Tlass did. Without such links, he said, Assad’s overthrow would plunge the country into a period of anarchic violence, and Syria’s chemical weapons would be up for grabs. “Today, many Alawites are not happy with what’s happening on the ground, but where is the safe zone for them?” he said. “Alawites need to know that there’s a strong side that will guarantee their safety if they defect.”Though Tlass is a Sunni Muslim, he commanded a unit of the Special Republican Guard, which is about 80 percent Alawite, the ethnic minority from which Assad and his inner circle are drawn. Tlass, 49, spoke movingly about his break from Assad, who, he said, has so bloodied his name that he will never be able to rule Syria effectively again. It began in the spring of 2011, when protests were spreading and Tlass offered to meet with demonstrators. He told Assad about an April meeting in Darayya with young rebels, whose fathers were silent but obviously proud. “This is the revolution of the fathers through their children,” Tlass warned, noting that such a conflict would be impossible to win by force. Assad was a changeable, uncertain man, increasingly swayed by the harder line of his family, especially his brother Maher and his cousin Hafez Makhlouf, who heads the internal branch of Syrian intelligence. “If you impose power, people will be afraid, and they will step back,” Makhlouf admonished Tlass. Tlass says that by May 2011, his counsel of outreach was ignored and his contacts were being arrested after he met them. This was the case even in Rastan, a town in central Syria where his father was born. After Tlass tried to make peace there, he was scolded by Makhlouf. Tlass stopped commanding his army unit after that. The rupture came in July 2011, when Assad summoned him and asked why he wasn’t leading his troops. Tlass said he responded that the president and his men weren’t sincere about compromise. “You are making me a liar. You and Syria are committing suicide,” he recalls saying. Assad responded that such counsel was “too simple,” and that he was moving to the “security option.”“You are carrying a heavy load — and if you want to fly, you have to drop that load,” Tlass says he told Assad at that last meeting. “But it seems the heavy load — the family, the inner circle — has won.” Tlass says he thought at first that he could stay in Damascus, in silent opposition to the hard-liners’ policies. But as the violence increased to countrywide slaughter, he says, “my conscience could not bear it anymore.” He began thinking by the end of last year about how to flee.The former general still has the rugged good looks that made him a charismatic military leader, which has led some to speculate that he might play a role in a Syrian transition. But Tlass says he doesn’t want any position in a future government and is focused only on his “road map” for avoiding sectarian strife. He’s probably wise to disavow political ambition, as his wealth, secular lifestyle and prominent background (his father was defense minister) make him a target for a populist, Islamist opposition movement.I first met Tlass a half-dozen years ago in Damascus, which may be one reason he decided to speak out and give the interview. When I asked him what he would say to Assad if he could send him one more message, he was overcome by emotion for a moment and left the room. When he returned, he said: “How can anyone think he is protecting his country when his air force and tanks are hitting his own territory?” davidignatius@washpost.com
