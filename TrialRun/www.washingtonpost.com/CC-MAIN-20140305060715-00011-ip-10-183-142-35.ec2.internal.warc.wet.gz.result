New schools chiefs, Beltway driver tale
By Patricia Sullivan
Good morning. Thunderstorms are in your future today.
New school leaders. A new schools chief is coming to town in Montgomery County, and he sounds psyched. In D.C., the low-key Kaya Henderson has been moving forward with reforms (without the heartburn of the previous superintendent). Her confirmation hearing, to remove the “interim” from her title, is today.
Less positive school news comes from Fauquier County, where an assistant principal at an elementary school is facing child pornography charges.
You’ll be talking about this guy, who is accused of driving drunk at 85 mph on the Beltway while having sex — and partially in the back seat. Can’t wait for the trial. Stands were less than filled along the 18th hole during practice rounds at the 2011 U.S. Open at Congressional Country Club.
(Matt McClain - For The Washington Post)
We jumped the gun on the U.S. Open yesterday, while the pros were practicing. As devoted duffers know, it really starts today. (I’m more of a Nats fan, myself.)
The Kennedy Center’s “Follies” is headed to Broadway. There’s a world of difference between a 56-year-old looking for work and a 76-year-old looking for support services, but the range of concerns is becoming more prominent as Washington area baby boomers look toward retirement.
More news to come today, including two people in the Jack B. Johnson case pleading guilty. We’ll have it all on PostLocal.
