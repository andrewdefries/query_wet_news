ABC’s ‘Titanic’: That sinking feeling
Laurence Cendrowicz/ITV/ LOOKOUT POINT TV - The highly anticipated ABC Premiere Event, "Titanic," a four-part miniseries, premieres SATURDAY, APRIL 14.
By Hank Stuever, E-mail the writer
Dreadful news, everyone: The Titanic has sunk again. It just keeps sinking and sinking and sinking . . .
How come some enterprising cruise line doesn’t just rebuild a fleet of them and sink one annually? (Disney? Carnival? Who has the rights?) Rebuild it and the masses would certainly come. It could be like one of those murder-mystery dinner inns, only more romantic, tragic. People would pay good money to dress up in Edwardian finery, set sail and glub-glub.

Hank Stuever is The Washington Post’s TV critic and author of two books, “Tinsel” and “Off Ramp.”

Free admission Get ideas Anyways, amid the many hours of Titanic centennial programming on the tube this month, ABC has quite cleverly programmed a British miniseries, four hours in length, airing this weekend (yes, four hours — including an approximate 1 squillion commercial breaks) written by none other than Julian Fellowes, the man who brought us the PBS smash “Downton Abbey.”
What’s that, you say? “Downton Abbey” on the Titanic? The Crawleys meet the iceberg? Upstairs, downstairs and wayyy downstairs? Why, that doesn’t sound at all unnecessary, given that James Cameron’s blockbuster “Titanic” (now in 3-D rerelease) lacked scope and ambition. What could possibly go wrong? Sounds unsinkable to me!Oh, poor lamb. Here’s your life vest and your deck chair. This whole thing is going down and taking us with it. It’s no secret to “Downton” fans that Fellowes is a fan of the disaster — Season 1 began with the household waking to the news that Lady Mary’s intended fiance perished on the voyage. Letting Fellowes roam around the Titanic is like letting the least motivated “Biggest Loser” contestant roam freely through the Hunan Palace Kountry Sizzlin’ Buffet. His eyes are bigger than his stomach, and the socioeconomic metaphors are piled high. The Titanic glistens and teems with his favorite dishes of class awkwardness.Uppercrust and nouveau-riche passengers scornfully regard one another in first class while their servants fret, flirt and fuss (and attempt to pocket a brooch — even this “Titanic’s” jewelry shenanigans can’t stand up to Cameron’s). In second class, those of slightly lesser means keep calm and carry on, etc. Below decks in steerage, cramped passengers talk incessantly about how much better life will be in New York, where nobody ever judges anybody because of how much money they have. (Maybe it’s good they never made it.)It’s not an altogether terrible cruise. Fellowes introduces a lot of characters — some real, some imagined, all played gamely by actors who do a splendid job of pretending they never saw the 1997 film — and begins his trademark juggling act among them. His dialogue is pure efficiency, but his characters are more like a set of Titanic paper dolls. The ship interiors have the look of a lovingly restored hotel that is now somebody’s Wyndham. The daughter of a countess is wooed by an American scion; an Italian waiter falls for one of the ship’s maids; a socialist revolutionary flees arrest by getting a steerage ticket, then stalks the wife of the ship’s electrician; nobody wants to give Molly Brown the time of day; the snakey J. Bruce Ismay sneaks aboard a lifeboat as his grand ship founders.Fellowes’s “Titanic” lovers never achieve the heat of Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater; the only between-the-sheets glimpse comes courtesy of Mr. Guggenheim and his French mistress. But the stories are sweet enough, and, in a twist that won’t surprise anyone who found the second season of “Downton Abbey” to be a little too sappy, there are a surprising number of happy endings waiting in the lifeboats for the Carpathia’s arrival. (Survivors galore!)Despite its meandering soapiness, there are passing moments of enjoyable “Downton”-like momentum wherein a viewer can eventually let go of the Cameron version (and “A Night to Remember” and the many, many documentaries in cable rotation) and simply enjoy the tilt.The series was clearly designed to air as four one-hour episodes. Three of them will air consecutively Saturday night, with the final hour airing Sunday. This distorts Fellowes’s one bit of fanciful story structure — each hour, we come at the story from a different beginning, working our way toward a crescendo where the Titanic begins to list.When it finally does go down once and for all, it does so with grace, dignity and a polite burp. One gets the feeling the producers couldn’t afford much else.
Titanic
(four hours) begins Saturday at 8 p.m. on ABC. Concludes Sunday at 9 p.m.

E-mail the writer
Jacqueline Bisset was obviously surprised to be named best supporting television actress at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s Golden Globes Sunday night. If she had remarks prepared, she seemed to forget them after taking about a minute to reach the stage from wherever she had been sitting. Instead, Bisset gave one of the night’s stranger speeches, one that despite being halting, awkward, and at times vindictive, was nonetheless affecting for its simple humor and honesty.
Bisset won the award for her role as Lady Cremone in “Dancing on the Edge,” a BBC series set in the London of the Great Depression. Tim Goodman called the murder mystery, broadcast in the United States by Starz, “a compelling look at race, class and jazz music in England during the 1930s.” During her speech, Bisset called on her fellow actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, who stars as Louis in the show.
Hank Stuever described Bisset’s speech this way:
At a loss for words, Bisset soon found some, reaching back across decades of apparent show-biz hurt and neglect, to the chagrin of the person at the control board tasked with muting out bad words. (And missed bleeping out the nefarious S-word.)Bisset’s goofiness seemed to set a tone: Say what you want, do what you want — it’s the Golden Globes and nobody really cares and the award choices might not make conventional sense. Tremble and sputter your way through it. Pause. (Pause again. Pause yet again.) Climb over and past those tightly packed tables to get to the stage. Make fun of the HFPA in funny, fake foreign accents. Ignore the orchestra cue midway through your incomprehensible acceptance speech and then really ignore the orchestra cue.
The Washington Post
A transcript of Bisset’s speech is below:
God (laughter, applause). . . I think it was 47 years ago that the Hollywood Foreign Press gave me a promising — a nomination for the — a promising newcomer! Thank you very much, Hollywood foreign press. I’m absolutely shaken — I can’t believe this — God knows — You’ve nominated me about five times — I think this — anyway — O.K. . . . Scottish background to the front. I always wanted to do something for the BBC. . . and we did this, and this was great. Chiwetel, where are you? Can I see Chiwetel? I need him for inspiration. Where is he? O.K. We had a good cast, didn’t we? It was great. Starz, thank you for putting this on, and . . . Thank you to my British agent, Steve Kenis, and my American agent, Harry Abrams. (Music plays. Bisset seems to recover her poise.) I’m sorry. I’m going to get this together. I want to thank the people who have given me joy, and there have been many. (Bisset is muted by the censor for a few words, but she can be seen to say: “And to the people who have given me”) s---, I say, like my mother, what did she say? — she said, “Go to hell, and don’t come back.” (Laughter, applause. The music changes, but Bisset shows no intention of leaving the stage.) However, however, however, my mother was not entirely me. I believe, if you want to look good, you’ve got to forgive everybody. You have to forgive everybody — it’s the best beauty treatment. Forgiveness for yourself, and for the others. (She blows a kiss. What or whom she is forgiving remains unclear, but no matter — it is forgiven.) I love my friends. I love my family, and you are so kind. Thank you so much.

The South is the epicenter of new HIV infections in the United States
David Kohn/For The Washington Post - HIV patient Michael Young talks via a telemedicine hookup with Dr. Prashanth Bhat. Nurse Diane Weil looks on. Young was in a clinic in Selma, Ala., and Bhat was 50 miles away in a clinic in Montgomery, Ala. on July 12, 2012. The telemedicine program is an innovative effort to give HIV patients in the state better access to better care. By David Kohn, selma, ala. — Afew blocks from the historic downtown, between a boarded-up office building and a vacant lot, sits a compact, one-story brick building with metal bars across the windows, a former doctor’s office that — like so much in this city of 20,000 — has seen better days. There are no signs or logos in front and to the casual passerby the building might look closed or even abandoned.
This is the city’s only HIV/AIDS organization, and it is purposely unmarked. Patients come here to Selma AIR (AIDS Information and Referral) from all across rural south Alabama, one of the states with the highest rate of HIV infections. “We don’t have a sign on purpose,” said Mel Prince, the group’s director. “We have patients who are scared to death that people will find out about their condition. People in the South are still in the dark ages about HIV.”

Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier identified HIV — the virus that causes AIDS — in 1983. The three decades since have seen wide medical and cultural advancements in our understanding of the virus. The years have also brought much hardship and controversy. Here’s a photographic history of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. More on this storyLIVE BLOG: 2012 AIDS Conference

CDC study: Good and bad news about teen sex behavior and HIV
Lena H. Sun Fewer black high schoolers are engaging in risky sexual behavior than 20 years ago, but overall rates have have declined only slightly.
Teens tell the world of HIV’s impact Caitlin Gibson Young activists become actors to show what it’s like growing up in a city with one of the nation’s highest HIV rates.
The stigma surrounding AIDS is a key reason that the South is the epicenter of new HIV infections in the United States. Half of all new infections in the United States are in the South, although the region has only a little more than a third of the country’s population, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The South also has the highest death rate due to HIV. The disproportionate number of cases in the South has many causes: widespread poverty, a shortage of health care, a lack of HIV testing and education, a shortage of accessible medical specialists for the many who live in small rural areas and a persistent prejudice by many in the Bible Belt against homosexuals, the group most affected by HIV/AIDS.“For many people in the South, HIV is not on the radar,” said Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC’s HIV/AIDS prevention division. “But the South is heavily affected.” The Deep South — Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and east Texas — has been hit hardest. “HIV is exploding in these states,” said Carolyn McAllaster, director of the Southern HIV/AIDS Strategy Initiative. A key reason, she said, is because people don’t get tested.Lynette Oliver, 46, an unemployed nursing assistant in Houma, a town of 34,000 in southeast Louisiana, had her HIV infection diagnosed this year. “People are scared to talk about it. I’ve had friends with HIV; their family disowns them, doesn’t let them eat off the same plates or drink out of the same cups.”Oliver decided to get tested when she kept losing weight. She is unsure, she said, of how she got infected but she is not all that surprised: “In my younger days, I did a lot. I been there, done that.”She has no health insurance; her medicine is paid for through state and federal programs for the indigent. “People just keep back from you” when they know you have HIV, she said. “I’ve felt it, that feeling that you’re not wanted.”Those who earn less than $10,000 a year are three times more likely to be infected with HIV than those who make more than $50,000, according to the CDC.“HIV is clearly a disease of poverty,” said Michael Saag, director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “And there is a lot of poverty in the South.”Once infected, poor people face steep obstacles to adequate care: They often have no health insurance and little money for medicines, tests and doctor’s appointments. The largest HIV clinic in southern Alabama, Medical AIDS Outreach of Alabama (MAO), treats 1,200 patients scattered across a broad swath of the poorest, most rural part of the state. More than three-quarters of its patients have an income below the federal poverty level, which is $23,050 for a family of four. Just 10 percent have private health insurance, and 40 percent have no insurance.African Americans have been hit hardest. They account for half of men, and nearly three-quarters of women, in the South whose HIV infections are newly diagnosed, according to the CDC. The situation in Mississippi is typical: African Americans make up 37 percent of the state’s population, but they account for nearly three-quarters of those with HIV. Rates are especially high for gay black men in the South; a 2011 study by researchers at the Florida Department of Health calculated that one in five were infected with HIV. Researchers say that African Americans in the South are especially likely to see homosexuality as immoral. In response, gay black men in the South often live on the “down low,” leading ostensibly straight lives with girlfriends and wives while having sex with men. “In the African American community, men who are gay are more likely to hide their sexual activity,” said Saag, who also directs a HIV clinic in Birmingham. “So it’s more common for the virus to spread from gay men to heterosexual women.”Because so many people in the South do not get tested for HIV, many who are infected don’t know it — and are likely to keep infecting others. “There are a lot of undiagnosed people out there,” said Laurie Dill, medical director of MAO.Cedric Wherry, a community outreach worker with Selma AIR, regularly sees patients who are afraid to get tested because of the stigma. “They will tell me ‘If I’m positive, I’d rather not know.’ ”By the time these people receive diagnoses, their disease has often progressed to full-blown AIDS, which significantly increases their risk of death. In Louisiana, for instance, nearly a quarter of people who test positive for HIV learn they already have AIDS. “We are seeing a lot of late testers,” said DeAnn Gruber, director of Louisiana’s HIV/AIDS program.A significant number of people diagnosed with HIV simply don’t get treatment, even though state and federal government aid often provides medicine for those who can’t pay. “There are many, many people in this state who have been diagnosed but are not in care,” said Harold Henderson, who directs an HIV clinic at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. Some don’t realize that treatment can keep the disease at bay and mistakenly think there’s nothing to be done, Henderson said.Throughout the South, sex education and HIV-prevention education tend to be limited, with most states and counties relying on abstinence as the touchstone. In general, state public health departments in the region are badly underfunded and have a hard time meeting the varied needs of people who have HIV or are at risk of being infected.Patients in the South often live far from doctors and specialists and lack transportation to get to them. In South Carolina, one in four of those with HIV live in rural areas, as do four in 10 in Mississippi — by far the highest percentage in the country.Many of these patients can’t afford a vehicle and have trouble getting to doctors, who are often 100 or more miles away.Some clinics in the South provide rides for patients or send doctors, nurses and case managers to rural areas. But mobile medical care is expensive. To improve this system, MAO recently began a telemedicine program designed to provide an instant long-distance link between doctors and patients. The first site, Selma, started operating in January, and now, once a week, doctors and case managers in Montgomery talk to patients in Selma via a high-speed video linkup. “It’s face to face in real time,” Dill said. “You can see the patients. You can see the medicines. It’s hard to do that on the phone.”On a recent humid, overcast morning in a small, windowless room in Selma’s sole hospital, Vaughan Regional Medical Center, 58-year-old Michael Young sat facing a large computer monitor. The thin, soft-spoken man with tinted glasses and short jheri-curled hair lives in Dixons Mills, a small community an hour west of Selma. His HIV infection was diagnosed six years ago; he said he was probably infected after having unprotected sex with a female partner. On the screen talking to him was Prashanth Bhat, a physician who specializes in HIV; Bhat is in Montgomery, 50 miles away. Bhat told Young he had “fantastic news”: The medicine was working so well that the HIV was undetectable in Young’s body. But Young had other chronic health issues — some likely related to HIV — including diabetes and kidney and liver problems. That day, in his monthly visit to this clinic, Young said he had pain from an apparent blocked artery in his leg that kept him up at night. Bhat promised to talk with a vascular surgeon about how to ease the pain.Bhat saw six patients on this day from various parts of the state — something that wouldn’t have been possible had he spent hours traveling. “It saves a ton of time,” he said.By next year, MAO and two partner clinics elsewhere in the state will have a total of six telemedicine sites. The expansion will allow the clinics to provide remote care to more than two-thirds of the state’s counties. The program, which is funded by MAO, the federal government and the national group AIDS United, will initially run for three years at a cost of $2.4 million.In another attempt to lessen the HIV/AIDS rate, Louisiana has instituted “opt-out” HIV testing in prisons and county jails, as well as state public health clinics. For these tests, providers assume that all patients want the test; patients who don’t want to be tested can opt out. The number of tests increased from 60,000 in 2007 to nearly 100,000 in 2010. Of those tested, about 1,000 were positive. “These are people who may not have gotten tested on their own,” Gruber said. The state is working to expand the opt-out approach to public hospital emergency rooms, which would further increase the number of tests.Many who work with HIV patients including Saag, the Birmingham HIV clinic director, are trying to win over churches. Many say that churches in the South often foster HIV stigma, presenting the disease as part of a sinful gay lifestyle. Saag and others are working to persuade pastors to see HIV as a health problem rather than a moral issue. Some observers are hoping that the new Affordable Care Act will improve HIV care in the South, and elsewhere, by increasing funds for Medicare and Medicaid recipients.Wherry, the Selma outreach worker, says success depends on a much wider acknowledgment that HIV is a real problem in the South. “People think if they ignore this, it will go away. It’s the elephant in the room,” he said. “We could get a handle on this virus if we just faced it.”

Syria Vows Phased Lebanon Exit
Some Personnel to Depart by March 31; U.S. Wants Prompt Final Pullout
By Robin Wright
Washington Post Staff Writer
Sunday, March 13, 2005; Page A01 In talks with a top U.N. envoy, Syria promised yesterday to withdraw one-third of its 15,000 troops and 5,000 intelligence agents in Lebanon by the end of March, as the first stage of an operation that would end its 29-year military presence in that country, according to U.S. and U.N. sources. Under strong pressure from the United States, Europe, Arab governments and anti-Syrian street protests in Lebanon, President Bashar Assad also pledged to move all remaining military and intelligence assets into Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley by the end of the month. In addition, he vowed to shut down Syria's intelligence headquarters in the capital, Beirut, by April 1. Syrian intelligence services have played a critical role in manipulating Lebanese political life.

Free E-mail Newsletters Today's Headlines & Columnists See a Sample | Sign Up Now Breaking News Alerts See a Sample | Sign Up Now A joint Lebanese-Syrian military commission will then meet on April 7 to determine the date of the final withdrawal of all forces, according to Western sources familiar with the negotiations.
U.S. officials welcomed the move but expressed deep concern about Syria's failure to provide a final pullout date. The United States will insist that the second stage brings "a complete and prompt withdrawal," a senior administration official said yesterday, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. U.S. intelligence noted significant movements by Syrian troops Friday out of Lebanon's coastal areas, particularly in the north, U.S. officials said. The Associated Press reported that an initial convoy of eight buses carrying hundreds of Syrian troops crossed the border into Syria yesterday. More than 60 military trucks left Lebanon as well, it said.
After lengthy talks at Assad's family home in Aleppo, Syria, U.N. special envoy Terje Roed-Larsen said in a telephone interview from Beirut that he had received "a firm commitment" for a two-stage withdrawal that would end Syria's long role as the dominant political and military influence in the affairs of its smaller neighbor. Roed-Larsen called the talks "very constructive" and said he was "much encouraged" by Assad's pledges. "The president has committed to withdraw from Lebanon all Syrian troops and intelligence from Lebanon in fulfillment of Security Council Resolution 1559," he said. The United States and France co-sponsored the U.N. resolution last fall after Syria maneuvered to keep its ally, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, in office for three more years after his constitutional term limit had expired. The United States has long opposed Syrian influence in Lebanon.
The Feb. 14 assassination in Beirut of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri, who resigned in protest and began mobilizing a new anti-Syrian opposition force inside Lebanon, galvanized foreign pressure to enforce the resolution. The United States is prepared to accept a withdrawal in phases but will not tolerate any "dilatory lingering," the administration official said. Washington will reserve judgment on Assad's pledge until it sees further action and proof of Syria's full withdrawal, given past broken promises from Damascus. Syria failed to comply with the 1989 accord that ended Lebanon's 15-year civil war and that called for the departure of Syrian forces. The troops had been sent to Lebanon in 1976 to try to end the war.
Syria's long history of meddling in Lebanon's government could undermine the joint commission that is negotiating the final withdrawal, U.S. officials warned.
Under the terms outlined yesterday, the first stage of Syria's withdrawal will include the relocation of all military forces and intelligence assets throughout Lebanon into the eastern Bekaa Valley, which borders Syria, in less than three weeks, Roed-Larsen said. During that period, a "significant" number of these troops and intelligence personnel will withdraw permanently into Syria. U.S. and U.N. officials later said Syria had agreed to pull out one-third of its personnel by the end of March.
The second stage will bring a "complete and full withdrawal" from the Bekaa of "all military personnel, assets and intelligence apparatus" into Syria, the U.N. envoy said. By April 1, he added, it will be clear whether Assad intends to keep his promise.
The Bush administration has expressed a desire to see all Syrian troops out of Lebanon before parliamentary elections due this spring, probably in May. If Syrian troops remain in the Bekaa during the campaign and elections, U.S. officials say, their presence may intimidate voters and influence the outcome.
Roed-Larsen's talks with Syria's young leader, who inherited power from his father in 2000, addressed only two of the major issues addressed in the U.N. resolution, the pullout of both troops and intelligence personnel. The envoy said he would continue his "dialogue" with Assad and other concerned parties to ensure full implementation of all the terms of the resolution, which include recognizing Lebanon's sovereignty and independence. The toughest remaining issue is the dismantling and disarming of the Shiite, Palestinian and Iranian militias still operating in Lebanon, all supported or armed by Syria. Roed-Larsen's plan is to achieve agreement on the issue of Syrian troops and Lebanon's sovereignty to help ensure free and fair elections, then let a new government address the militia issue, according to a senior U.S. official. After his talks in Damascus, Roed-Larsen traveled to Beirut for talks with Lebanese opposition leaders as well as Lahoud and Prime Minister Omar Karami, who are both allies of Syria. He is scheduled to go next to France and then to the United States, where he is to brief U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and U.S. officials.

The United States and France are planning to introduce two U.N. resolutions next week aimed at holding Syria to account for meddling in Lebanon and for its alleged links to the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri, according to several sources close to the diplomacy.
The moves would be the toughest international action ever taken against Syria and would be designed to further isolate President Bashar Assad, who for the first time is getting the cold shoulder from key Arab governments such as those in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Western envoys said.
The impending actions will be "the perfect storm for Damascus," said a Western diplomat at the United Nations, speaking on the condition of anonymity because planning is still underway. "It's pretty clear the Syrians don't have any friends left."
The resolutions may be introduced as early as Tuesday, he said. They would follow two reports on Syria expected to be submitted over the next two days to the U.N. Security Council.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan discussed the reports and plans for new resolutions during a working breakfast in New York, said sources familiar with the talks. Rice has been engaged in diplomacy on Syria over the past week during travels to France, Russia and Britain.
Rice requested the meeting, which was not announced until it was over. "The region and the world have a number of issues with Syrian behavior," said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack, adding that the Lebanese, Iraqi and Palestinian governments have all protested Syrian practices.
The most crucial report expected to be delivered this week is from German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis, who will submit results of his U.N. investigation into the assassination of Hariri, who was Lebanon's leading reformer. Although the details of the report have been closely held, diplomats said they expect it to implicate Syria in the slaying of Hariri and 19 others in a Feb. 14 bombing, and to say that Syria has not fully complied with the investigation.
The U.N. envoy for Lebanon, Terje Roed-Larsen, is also scheduled to deliver a status report on Resolution 1559, which was co-sponsored by the United States and France last year. It calls for Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon and for the dismantling of militias. This report is expected to say that Syria has facilitated the flow of illicit arms and individuals into Palestinian camps in Lebanon, further undermining Lebanon's stability.
Syria says it has complied with the United Nations by ending its 29-year occupation and withdrawing about 14,000 troops from Lebanon in April. It also denies any links to the Hariri bombing.
"We have supported the Mehlis mission, and we have been cooperating with Mehlis," Imad Moustapha, Syria's ambassador to the United States, said yesterday. "We are absolutely categoric in saying we had nothing to do with Hariri. . . . If he does not reveal the truth, then this will allow certain people to point fingers here and there without any shred of evidence.
"President Assad has said that if any Syrian individual has been party to this crime or implicated in the assassination of Hariri, then he has committed a treasonous crime."
But key Security Council members have discussed extending the Mehlis mission until Dec. 15, which the U.N. chief can do without going to the Security Council. An extension could be used to continue probing or to provide a psychological boost for Lebanese authorities in persevering in the prosecution of Hariri's slaying, which unleashed the Cedar Revolution.
The scope of any punitive action against Syria is also under discussion, diplomats said. The Bush administration has considered language critical of Syria for support of terrorism that could also be used to punish or pressure Damascus for aiding extremists in Iraq, envoys familiar with the diplomacy said.
But France and other nations want the focus to be limited to Syria's intervention in Lebanon, mainly to prevent Arab backlash at a time of public anger over the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Of particular concern is the position of Algeria, whose socialist government has been close to Damascus in the past. Also, Algeria is now the Arab representative on the 15-member Security Council.
But U.S., European and U.N. officials say Assad's government is facing bleak prospects even in the Arab world. Last month, Assad visited Cairo to win support from Egypt, a political trendsetter that accounts for more than half the Arab population. Instead, U.S. and Arab envoys say, President Hosni Mubarak told him to comply fully with Mehlis -- and not to expect help if Syrian officials are implicated.
After their first summit, held in Paris yesterday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora issued a statement condemning the movement of arms and militants into the Palestinian refugee camps. At a joint news conference, Siniora said he and Abbas are specifically concerned about Syria's role.

Monday, July 2, 2007
PITTSBURGH, July 1 -- There were nothing but positive vibes in the Washington Nationals clubhouse Sunday afternoon, where Dmitri Young dressed as a newly minted all-star, where Jesus Flores carefully ushered his first home-run ball back home, where Mike Bacsik noted how fun it is to pitch competitively, to help his team win. Such feelings are possible after a 3-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, a result that made the quick flight home much more relaxed.
Yet even with a five-game losing streak halted, there were mixed feelings on a day that marked the halfway point of the season -- 81 games in, 81 to go. The Nationals are in last place in the National League East, right where they were predicted to be. They have the second-worst record in baseball -- Cincinnati has the worst -- and considering some of the sky-is-falling projections from the spring, staving off abject failure could be, in a warped way, considered something of a triumph.
To a man, though, the Nationals (33-48) dismissed such thinking. They are on pace to go 66-96. They would very much like to avoid a repeat of such mediocrity in the second half.
"When we lose, it can't be: 'Oh, it's okay. We're supposed to,' " said catcher Brian Schneider, the team's longest-tenured player. "No freakin' way. You shouldn't accept it. I don't care what everyone says. I don't care what people predict. I don't care what you predicted, or the people on ESPN said. We're going to try to win every game. Is it okay to lose? No, it's not."
Such is the difficulty of the evaluation at the halfway point. Sunday wrapped up the club's story in one tidy two-hour 14-minute package. Bacsik, who hadn't pitched in the majors since 2004 before this season, went six innings and gave up one earned run, the kind of unexpected performance from a fill-in player that has helped keep the Nationals afloat. Flores, the rookie catcher who plays but once a week, hit the first homer of his major league career, a two-run shot that snuck over the left field wall in the sixth, the kind of thing that might be expected of him in three or four seasons, when he is more experienced.
Yet there they were, a stop-gap part and a prospect, combining for the victory.
"I was excited," Flores said. "I'm so happy about it. It's great to help the team win. I have the ball, and it's something special to keep."
In truth, though, Bacsik (2-5, 4.65 ERA) and Flores are bit players in any assessment of the season's first half, here only because the rotation has been devastated by injuries and because the club needed a catching prospect in the Rule 5 draft.
Even Young, who had two more hits to lift his average to .340, was signed as a low-rent fill-in for injured starter Nick Johnson, who hasn't played this season because of a broken leg. Therefore, Young could be traded for a prospect who could develop into a piece of the future.
So the true evaluations should be of those who are supposed to be here in years to come, from third baseman Ryan Zimmerman (.245, 42 RBI) to right fielder Austin Kearns (.254, 26 RBI, fewest for a regular fifth-place hitter in baseball) to infielder Felipe Lopez (.234, .284 on-base percentage, nine steals) and others. Most of the Nationals feel they left a slew of wins on the table in the first half because, with few exceptions, the players who are supposed to excel have not.
"By no means do I think I've done as good as I can," Zimmerman said. "I think Kearns would say the same thing. Felipe would say the same thing. So for us to win as many games as we can with a bunch of us not performing, there's reason to think we can do better in the second half."
A year ago on July 1, Zimmerman was hitting .272 and 51 RBI. Kearns was hitting .273 with 15 homers and 47 RBI for the Cincinnati Reds. Lopez, also with the Reds at that point, was hitting .274 with 22 steals. Even the bullpen, which is considered the team's strength, has blown 15 saves, tied for second-most in baseball.
"From an 'experts' standpoint, I think we probably did a little better than they thought," Kearns said. "But I don't think anybody in here is happy about that. . . . There's quite a few of us who have not done our part."
Thus, the cup-is-half-full-view: The performances will be better in the second half because they have been better in the past.
"We have about, I would say, five -- at least -- positions that are under-achieving," Manager Manny Acta said. "I mean, I'm looking forward to the second half because this absolutely cannot continue to go this way. And if those guys come alive, then the second half will be better for us."
Sunday, they came alive, but barely. Washington's runs came on Robert Fick's bases loaded groundout in the fourth and Flores's homer -- on an 0-2 curveball from Pirates starter Paul Maholm. Those three runs marked the high-water mark on this road trip, which featured all of 10 runs in six games.
The bullpen, though, did what was required on Sunday. Luis Ayala relieved Bacsik with the bases loaded in the seventh. He gave up a pair of sacrifice flies but no hits. Jon Rauch, two days removed from giving up the winning run in the bottom of the ninth, pitched a perfect eighth in which he struck out Xavier Nady and Jason Bay. And closer Chad Cordero allowed a single in the ninth, but finished with a strikeout and a double-play ball.
Afterward, the Nationals exchanged congratulatory high-fives for the 33rd time this year. And the question remained: Can they do it more often in the second half?

Prosecutors Clear Hatfill in Anthrax Case
NEWS | LOCAL | POLITICS | SPORTS | OPINIONS | BUSINESS | ARTS & LIVING | GOING OUT GUIDE | JOBS | CARS | REAL ESTATE |SHOPPING Prosecutors Clear Hatfill in Anthrax Case
By Carrie Johnson and Joby Warrick
Washington Post Staff Writers
Saturday, August 9, 2008
Federal prosecutors yesterday officially "excluded" scientist Steven J. Hatfill from involvement in the deadly 2001 anthrax mailings, formally closing the door on a costly episode that sidetracked the FBI's search for the real culprit for nearly five years.
U.S. Attorney Jeffrey A. Taylor sent a letter yesterday to a lawyer for Hatfill, a onetime Fort Detrick, Md., bioweapons researcher, that essentially cleared Hatfill of a crime in which he was declared "a person of interest" six years ago.
The decision to exonerate Hatfill amounts to an unambiguous acknowledgment by authorities that they misspent thousands of investigative hours fruitlessly trying to link him to the crime. It was only about 18 months ago that the government turned its attention to bacteriologist Bruce E. Ivins, who had become the leading suspect before his death by a drug overdose last week.
As late as a news conference Wednesday, prosecutors had shied away from mentioning Hatfill or characterizing their law enforcement interest in him, despite prodding from the news media. In June, the Justice Department agreed to pay $5.85 million to resolve a lawsuit Hatfill had filed over violations of his privacy rights. But the government did not admit wrongdoing or clear Hatfill at that time, stoking speculation that authorities were withholding information.
The doubt lifted yesterday.
"We have concluded, based on lab access records, witness accounts, and other information, that Dr. Hatfill did not have access to the particular anthrax used in the attacks, and that he was not involved in the anthrax mailings," Taylor wrote.
Forensic techniques that allowed government scientists to genetically match the anthrax used in the bioterror attacks with a batch kept in Ivins's custody did not exist in 2002, when agents searched Hatfill's home, Taylor added.
Lawmakers and legal experts have called on the FBI to release more information about the probe, including when agents determined that Hatfill was not involved and why they did not share that information with a judge overseeing his privacy lawsuit. Critics say the bureau's single-minded pursuit of Hatfill blinded agents to the possibility of another culprit and allowed Ivins to move freely for years in sensitive biodefense labs.
This week, prosecutors and federal agents said their prime and only suspect in the anthrax mailings, which killed five people, was Ivins, who died July 29 after authorities signaled they would move to indict him.
Despite Ivins's death, the investigation continues while federal agents check computers seized from the Frederick library July 31 and pursue new leads. They intend to examine another e-mail account Ivins used and will look for clues to the crimes or to his mental state days before his suicide. Agents also are seeking to determine whether Ivins communicated with others about his plans, according to a government source briefed on the matter.
Also yesterday, the Army announced the creation of a team of medical and other experts to review security measures at the biodefense lab where Ivins worked. Army Secretary Pete Geren said he is asking at least a dozen military and civilian officials to scrutinize safety procedures, quality controls, and other policies and practices at the lab, an Army spokesman said.
Meanwhile, two days after the release of documents in the case, investigators sought to put to rest a nearly seven-year-old controversy over whether the anthrax mailer used special additives to make the concoction even more lethal.
Since the fall of 2001, federal officials have made contradictory statements about whether the powdered anthrax contained a form of the mineral silicon. The presence of silicon dioxide -- also known as silica -- would be highly significant, suggesting that the bioterrorist took additional steps to ensure that the powder would not clump and would penetrate deeply into victims' lungs. Silica was part of the recipe for a particularly deadly anthrax weapon made by Soviet military scientists.
On Nov. 7, 2001, then-Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge said at a news conference that the anthrax powder contained silica, a statement that implied that the bioterrorist had access to secret government formulas for making biological weapons.
But in the documents released this Wednesday, the FBI clarified Ridge's statement. The powder contained not silica but silicon, which was present "within the spores," the documents said. There was no silica coating on the spores, as would be expected if someone had deliberately added the material to keep the spores from clumping.
Two government scientists with knowledge of the FBI's investigation said the presence of silicon, while not fully explained, does not appear to be significant. The scientists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the silicon was probably an inadvertent contaminant and might have been introduced when the bacteria was being grown in the lab.
Still, numerous scientists and biodefense experts continued to complain that the FBI has not publicly addressed questions about silicon as well as other technical facets of the case. Many scientists, including colleagues of Ivins, say the evidence presented so far has not conclusively linked Ivins to the anthrax letters.
"They have got to get some technically competent people to talk about the science," said Tara O'Toole, director of the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. "For all I know, they may have it down cold. But they need to be transparent."

SAINT-FARGEAU, France, July 15 -- Mark Cavendish won the 11th stage of the Tour de France on Wednesday, while Rinaldo Nocentini of Italy held on to the yellow jersey and Lance Armstrong remained third overall.
Armstrong finished safely in the main pack, with his Astana teammate Alberto Contador narrowly ahead of him in second place overall after Wednesday's 119-mile trek from Vatan to Saint-Fargeau.
Nocentini leads Contador by six seconds and Armstrong trails by eight.
"I feel in very good shape," Nocentini said. "I hope to keep the yellow jersey."
Nocentini was among the riders who fell in two early crashes, giving Belgian rider Johan Van Summeren and Marcin Sapa of Poland the opportunity to break away after 18.7 miles.
"I was in a fall, but nothing too serious. I didn't hurt myself," Nocentini said. "I managed to get back up and finish calmly."
Cavendish sealed his second straight stage win and fourth of the Tour. The British cyclist finished about half a bike length ahead of American Tyler Farrar in a sprint finish on a flat stage. The 24-year-old Cavendish finished in 4 hours 17 minutes 55 seconds.
Armstrong, who did not stop for reporters after the stage, finished in 54th place. Contador was 43rd.
"Fast start, crashes a plenty, then a breakaway," Armstrong wrote on his Twitter feed. "Ended up being pretty relaxed. Cav wins again. . . . Congrats to him."
Cavendish took the green jersey from Thor Hushovd of Norway, who finished fifth, and equaled British rider Barry Hoban's career tally of eight Tour stage wins.
"I was able to get the jump on Thor and win, so it was perfect," Cavendish said. "It was just beautiful the way the guys could adapt to the situation and deliver me to the sprint."
Cavendish will defend the green jersey on another flat stage Thursday, a 131-mile trek from Tonnerre to Vittel featuring six small hills. The course again favors sprinters, and time differences are unlikely to be significant among the top three.
Armstrong's rivalry with Contador could be reignited Friday, with a small opportunity for an attack on one tough climb up the Col du Platzerwasel. However, such an attack will likely be more effective in Sunday's 15th stage -- which features a tough uphill ride to Verbier.
The early leaders were eventually caught by the chasing pack, led by the Team Columbia-High Road riders, some three miles from the finish.
The Columbia team worked well together at the front, just as they did Tuesday, to get Cavendish in the best position to attack in the closing stages.

Jack Garson grew up knowing that if he was going to be successful, he would have to work very hard. He worked his way through the University of Maryland at College Park and George Washington University Law School. At 27, only two years into his law career, he was made a partner at Stein Sperling in Rockville. Later, he founded his own law firm in Bethesda, Garson Claxton, which today employs 10 attorneys and 10 support personnel and services clients ranging from small start-ups to BAE Systems, the world's second-largest defense contractor. Last year, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) tapped him as a director of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, where he is aiding in the search for a new president and chief executive and helping to oversee construction of the massive Silver Line project. In March, his book, "How to Build a Business and Sell it for Millions," was published. Garson, 49, lives in Potomac with his wife, Marcy, the chief executive of his firm.
WHY HE'S SUCCESSFUL
"I would say having a plan and being very dedicated to that plan. I am one of those people that if I say I'm going to do something, I do it, even if it kills me ... I also wanted to make my parents proud. I noticed from a very young age when I'd bring home a report card with six A's and one B and my dad would say, 'What happened?' I wanted it to be straight A's. I wanted his complete approval. That was big driver for me, and I think that's a driver for a lot of people ... especially people like me who didn't start with a lot, wanting to prove to people that they could do it, that they were capable ... More than the trappings of success, the money and the power, etc., it was wanting people to know 'I am a good person. I can make this happen.' "
OBSTACLES HE OVERCAME
Having to work so hard. "Starting in an environment, like a lot of people, that didn't have any built-in breaks for me ... When I was a little kid, it was completely clear to me from the hand-me-downs I was wearing to the day-old bread I was eating that there was no money for college. And if I was going to make it, I needed great grades and I needed to work at a very young age ... From [age] 15 to 25, I could not flinch."
FIRST JOB
"When I was 5 years old, I polished my dad's shoes ... once a week for 25 cents. I took tremendous pride in doing a good job. He was very pleased with the quality of my work, and I was very proud that he trusted me to do it. It instilled in me the concept of work hard, get approval, make money. I think I've done that ever since. Later, I had three jobs in the neighborhood, delivering newspapers, shoveling snow and cutting lawns."
BEST JOB
"The one I have today and that's because I have so much control over our ability to achieve our clients' objectives."
A GOOD LESSON
After earning a degree in English and economics at Maryland, he enrolled in law school and worked for a judge, a lobbying law firm and a regular firm to gain experience. "I made money working at a movie theater, sweeping up popcorn, scraping up gum and tearing tickets. I worked at a theater in the neighborhood where I grew up, and my peers were always coming in on their big date nights ... with their dates, driving their Camaros ... I felt like wearing a sign that said, 'I'm not going to be doing this forever! This is just part of my plan!' "
BIGGEST MISSTEP
After 10 years as a partner at Stein Sperling, Garson felt he had maxed out and took a job as in-house general counsel for a former client. "I loved the people, but I didn't love the work. I was in meetings for eight hours a day. I missed practicing law so much that I used to bring court cases to the meetings and read them during these long meetings."
SMARTEST MOVE
"I was driving to work one day. I had this weird pit in my stomach. I said ... 'I haven't had this pit in my stomach since junior high when I was afraid of getting beaten up on the way to school.' And I realized I didn't like my job . . I went home and talked to wife and said, 'Honey, remember that part about for better or for worse? This is the for-worse part.' She became my first employee ... I'd work all day, then starting at 6:30 in the evening, I'd be planning for the new law firm," which he opened in 1998.
ADVICE TO THE ASPIRING
"Get exposure to the world. Learn what the world is all about. Learn what you want to do. Don't let the path of least resistance or coincidence take you where you want to go ... It's really hard to get to the career that you want, but you should be in the career you want. You should commit yourself to that volunteer internship if that's what it takes to get the experience. Talk to people, plead with people to give you five minutes of their time for career advice. And create a plan that will eventually get you where you want to go."
