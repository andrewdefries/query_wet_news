Loudoun’s got live music, but no more Summer Musicfest
By Tom Jackman
Singer Michael Sheppard (r) and his band Milkshake perform at last year's Acoustic on the Green in Leesburg, and will be back again this year.
(Town of Leesburg)
There are some pretty decent live music options available for Loudoun County this summer, including an excellent lineup at Leesburg’s free Acoustic on the Green series and the “Buncearoo”-produced shows at the Franklin Park Arts Center in Purcellville. And over in Clarke County, there are plenty of options at the new Barns of Rose Hill in Berryville.
But it looks like it’s all over for the late great Loudoun Summer Musicfest at the Belmont Country Club in Ashburn, which for years staged a host of comfortable outdoor rock, country and reggae shows in a big pasture just off Route 7. They cancelled last summer with the hopes of returning in 2012, but a spokeswoman for the country club said they’ve heard nothing, and my detective work has been unable to find anyone or anything that indicates they’re coming back.
The lineup at the ninth annual Acoustic on the Green series includes Jon Carroll, who won Musician of the Year, Songwriter of the Year and Pop Rock Instrumentalist of the Year last year from the Washington Area Music Association; Ted Garber, last year’s Artist in Residence at Strathmore; Cal Everett, lead singer of NoVa’s beloved ’80s hit-makers Four Out of Five Doctors; and two-time Wammie male vocalist of the year Michael Sheppard, whose kid-friendly band Milkshake was nominated for a Grammy in 2010. Carroll kicks it off June 9.
In Purcellville, the music-loving couple of Bill and Cheryl Bunce are promoting several shows at Franklin Park, including the Alternate Routes and Tim Snider, after hosting concerts in their backyard in Round Hill for a couple of years. The Loudoun Times-Mirror’s Crystal Owens profiled the Bunces, who modestly billed their shows as “the Austin City Limits of Northern Virginia, or at least Purcellville.” Hey, Austin had to start somewhere too, y’know. Kudos to the Bunces for kicking it in P’town. Or ville. And here’s a video explaining a little more about what they call “the greatest local concert series you’ll ever see in Northern Virginia.”

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Vertigo can be frightening, but it often can be treated without drugs
Brian Stablyk/GETTY IMAGES - Vertigo can be eased without drugs. The balance disorder can also be a sign of a more serious ailment.
Vertigo is an unsettling yet common condition, similar to seasickness but without the sea. With its illusory sense of spinning, vertigo can be frightening and lead to nausea, vomiting, headaches and other symptoms. But a solution is often more simple than you might think.
Vertigo has been linked to anxiety, a drop in blood pressure, migraines, multiple sclerosis and Meniere’s disease, a disorder of the ear that can also cause tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and hearing loss. It can also signal a more serious condition, such as a brain tumor or stroke, although that is less common.
One of the more prevalent types of vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV, occurs more frequently with age. It is thought to be caused by the formation of canaliths, tiny calcium deposits or crystals within the inner ear that can destabilize equilibrium, causing people to feel as if they’re in a room that’s spinning.Dizziness from BPPV can be triggered by minor changes in head position, such as looking up, rolling over or leaning forward. Episodes of BPPV are usually brief — measured in minutes instead of the hours or days experienced in other forms of vertigo — but they may occur frequently.BPPV can usually be treated with simple head movements that can be done in a physician’s office or at home. There are several types of movements. The Epley maneuver and its variations involve moving your head through a series of positions to remove canaliths from the inner-ear canal.Your primary-care doctor or a vestibular therapist can show you how to perform this simple treatment. If you experience vertigo, you should see a doctor to rule out more serious causes. And the treatment maneuvers should be done carefully by those who have spinal or vascular conditions in or around the neck.
When vertigo strikes
Terry D. Fife, director of balance disorders and otoneurology at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, answers commonly asked questions about dizziness:
What’s the most common cause of dizziness? Transient low blood pressure, the kind that happens when you stand up suddenly from a crouch and feel dizzy for a few seconds. Most people have it occasionally and don’t worry about it.
Is that the same as vertigo? No. In vertigo, people feel the world whirling around them, often with nausea and vomiting. It really gets their attention. The most common recurrent vertigo is benign positional vertigo, in which calcium crystals that are part of the inner-ear structures that detect gravity and movement break off and move into an area of the canal they shouldn’t be. It usually happens when you turn over in bed or when you tilt your head far backward, not from turning your head when you’re sitting up.Another common vertigo cause is vestibular neuritis, an infection of the inner ear probably caused by ordinary cold viruses. All of a sudden, you feel a little woozy, and within an hour you’re ready for the ER. The nausea and vomiting usually subside within a day or two and your immune system takes care of the virus on the same schedule it takes care of the cold, but you may not move around normally for weeks or months. But you should force yourself to do so, because you’ll recover more quickly.
What about more serious causes? Meniere’s disease is a condition in which the inner ear swells up intermittently. The attacks can cause totally incapacitating vertigo along with a feeling of pressure, ringing in the ear and hearing loss in the affected ear. Each attack does a little more damage to hearing and balance. The initial treatment is a low-sodium diet and a diuretic blood-pressure pill. If that doesn’t work, there are additional treatments, ending with surgery to disconnect the balance nerve of the inner ear. Sudden vertigo can also be a sign of an impending brainstem stroke, usually accompanied by slurred speech, double vision and clumsiness of the extremities.

Former aide accuses Christie of lying about bridge scandal
View Photo Gallery — Chris Christie and the George Washington Bridge scandal: E-mails revealed a top aide to the N.J. governor and political appointees ordered lane closures at the George Washington Bridge in September. By Robert Costa and David A. Fahrenthold, E-mail the writers
One of the key players in a scandal surrounding Chris Christie accused the New Jersey governor on Friday of lying about his role.
David Wildstein, a former Christie appointee who presided over the George Washington Bridge lane closures at the center of the controversy, said through a letter from his attorney that “evidence exists . . . tying Mr. Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the Governor stated publicly.”

Christie’s office denied the accusation. Wildstein is the first Christie ally to publicly question the governor’s account, and his claim could further damage Christie as he tries to restore his image amid aggressive investigations by Democratic lawmakers and a federal prosecutor.Also Friday, Bill Stepien, a longtime political adviser to Christie, said he would refuse to testify before the state legislative committee investigating the episode — raising the possibility that more damaging information could emerge.Wildstein, who attended the same high school as Christie, was appointed by Christie to a position at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. In September, Wildstein and another of Christie’s top appointees at the Port Authority ordered the lane closures, causing four days of gridlock in Fort Lee, apparently as retribution against the town’s mayor for not endorsing Christie for reelection. Wildstein resigned in December.“Mr. Wildstein contests the accuracy of various statements that the Governor made about him and he could prove the inaccuracy of some,” wrote his attorney, Alan L. Zegas.The main purpose of the letter to the Port Authority was to argue that it should pay Wildstein’s legal fees during the investigations.
Wildstein gave almost no details about what he is asserting is untrue in Christie’s accounts. And he said nothing about what the important evidence is, or who has it.That made it hard to judge what role Wildstein’s letter — first reported by the New York Times — would play in the investigations.In rejecting Wildstein’s accusations, a Christie aide said in an e-mail: “Mr. Wildstein’s lawyer confirms what the Governor has said all along — he had absolutely no prior knowledge of the lane closures before they happened and whatever Mr. Wildstein’s motivations were for closing them to begin with.” The aide added: “As the Governor said in a December 13th press conference, he only first learned lanes were closed when it was reported by the press and as he said in a January 9th press conference, had no indication that this was anything other than a traffic study until he read otherwise the morning of January 8th. The Governor denies Mr. Wildstein’s lawyer’s other assertions.”During a news conference in January, Christie said he had only recently learned that the closures had been ordered by his administration.“I had no knowledge of this — of the planning, the execution or anything about it — and I first found out about it after it was over,” Christie said then. Even when he found out about it, he said then, “what I was told was that it was a traffic study.”Christie’s supporters were quick Friday to rally behind the governor, a possible Republican presidential hopeful. Anthony Carbonetti, a GOP consultant and longtime friend of Christie, said Wildstein’s letter is “not a smoking gun.”“If he had a smoking gun, he would have immunity already,” Carbonetti said. “Wildstein’s letter does not contradict Christie and it’s the work of someone who is trying to get his legal bills paid.”In January, Wildstein pleaded the Fifth Amendment when he appeared with Zegas before a state assembly hearing about the traffic snarl.In an interview last month, Zegas told The Washington Post that Wildstein is eager to share information, as long as state and federal prosecutors grant him immunity.“My client is willing to speak freely if he is conferred immunity,” Zegas said. “If he is granted immunity, he will fully cooperate. In the meantime, he intends to fully comply with his legal obligations, and we will voluntarily supply more documents without redactions.”Wildstein and Christie attended Livingston High School in northern New Jersey, with Wildstein graduating in 1979 and Christie in 1980. The school had about 600 students per class, and the two were vastly different. Christie was the hyper-social class president, and Wildstein an introvert. “We didn’t travel in the same circles in high school,” Christie said in his January news conference.But they shared an interest.“They both were associated with the baseball team at the same time, Chris as a player, David as a statistician,” said Tony Hope, a coach at Livingston at the time. But, he said, Wildstein’s role with the team was mainly limited to watching games from the stands. “There was no friendship of Chris Christie and David Wildstein during their high school days,” Hope said. “A casual acquaintance, at best.” In recent interviews, several of Christie’s fellow players said they did not recall Wildstein and Christie being close. “I think he was the manager or the assistant manager of the team,” said Mike Inga, a former player now living in San Diego. “He used to travel. But I never saw him and Chris hanging out. It definitely wasn’t somebody that he would consider a friend.”The flurry of activity Friday created a fresh distraction for Christie, who has been busy preparing for Sunday’s Super Bowl, which will be held in East Rutherford, N.J. He was undeterred Friday night, however, appearing at radio personality Howard Stern’s birthday party in New York City and introducing rock star Jon Bon Jovi. Pictures on Twitter showed Christie, dressed in a suit, grasping a microphone as he addressed the glitzy crowd.“Happy birthday, Howard,” he said, according to an account in the Newark Star-Ledger. “I’m here to bring all praise from New Jersey to Howard Stern.”
