PHOTOS| Le Diplomate Pianist Michael Arnowitt delivers an on-point performance at National Gallery
By Joan Reinthaler, E-mail the writer
The National Gallery of Art’s new exhibition is “Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes” and, in its honor, pianist Michael Arnowitt has put together a beautifully thought-out program — a bits-and-pieces retrospective of what was going on musically about 1913, when the past, present and future vied for position. He played it at the gallery Sunday with an exquisite sense of touch, color and musical imagination.
To watch Arnowitt as he plays, sitting quietly at the keyboard, you might expect soulless music-making, but you could not be more wrong. He doesn’t go for cheap effects. He listens intently. His dynamics are calculated for their particular context, his music moves with tantalizing inevitability, and he produces the most rewardingly supple lines. (Sandy Macys/Times Argus) - Michael Arnowitt played Sunday at the National Gallery with an exquisite sense of touch, color and musical imagination.

Free admission Get ideas Acoustically, the gallery’s West Garden Court might not be the easiest venue for pianists, but Arnowitt found ways to make even the lush textures of the opening movement of the Rachmaninoff Sonata No. 2 in B-flat Minor sound clean and focused without sacrificing urgency or passion. Three of Debussy’s Book 2 Preludes trickled off the keys with shadings of dynamics that were almost imperceptible but perfectly satisfying. And both the humor of Satie’s in-your-face “Embryons Desseches,” or “Dessicated Embryos” (performed while pianist Jeffrey Chappell narrated musings on the piece), and the dark foreboding of Leo Ornstein’s “Suicide in an Airplane” emerged full of character.The evening’s highlight was a glowingly gentle, sonorous reading of the Alcott movement from Ives’s “Concord” Sonata, which began reflectively and built almost imperceptibly to a intricate sketch of a complex New England personality.The concert’s smashing finale was a technically brilliant and musically convincing performance of Arnowitt’s arrangement of the first half of “The Rite of Spring.” More orchestral than pianistic, it conjured up, almost eerily, sounds of woodwinds, percussion and all the rest. Stravinsky arranged this for two pianos, and that arrangement is a technical stretch. Pulling it off solo was an impressive tour de force.The applause was loud and long but, wisely, Arnowitt did not play an encore. What could follow the Stravinsky?

#10 - SOPA
The Stop Online Piracy Act has been a topic of intense interest online this year, involving myriad interest groups and placing Hollywood, Congress and Silicon Valley heavy-hitters and everyday Internet users in a fierce debate over how best to counteract online piracy. Ideas@Innovations blogger Dominic Basulto wrote about the “ugly message” the legislation sends to the world. This prompted commenter “alance” to write, “We are surrendering all of our rights, freedoms and liberties to an authoritarian police state formerly known as the USA.” Read “SOPA’s ugly message to the world” Tammie Arroyo

#9 - Fearing India
If it wasn’t a fear of China that had readers interested, it was a fear of India, particularly as it related to Silicon Valley. Post columnist Vivek Wadhwa wrote about exactly this, prompting commenter “Nymous” to write, “When people offshore jobs, they offshore innovation with it. I'm not worried about India, the more they do the more potential market there is for stuff from the US.” In this photo, the Taj Mahal is reflected in the Yamuna River in Agra, India, in 2000. Read “Why Silicon Valley should fear India”

#8 - Steve Jobs
Almost immediately after the news landed that he had died, the Web overflowed with condolences for and stories about the life of Steve Jobs, so it’s no surprise that our Ideas@Innovations blog post remembering the Apple co-founder, former CEO and board chairman made the year’s top-10 list. Commenter “vijayadhiraaj” simply wrote, “Oh my God Steve... “ In this photo, Jobs shows off the iPod Mini, at the Macworld Conference and Expo in San Francisco on Jan. 6, 2004. Read “Steve Jobs dies: Remembering a legacy”

#7 - The engineering myth
The number of engineers in the United States, and whether the president was aware of just how many there are, had readers hooked this year. Post columnist Vivek Wadhwa’s column on the engineer shortage myth prompted commenter “jwdkturner” to write: “I have worked as an engineer many years with a major corporation. I hire engineers. My observation is that there is not a lack of engineers, but a lack of really good ones.” Read “Mr. President, there is no engineer shortage”

#6 - DNA's future
The prospect of human DNA becoming the next great hacking frontier also made the list of popular topics this year. The column by Washington Post columnist Vivek Wadha prompted commenter “jralger” to write, “Question: Does the Army know about this ?” In this photo, John Mears, Director of Biometric and Identity Management Solutions at Lockheed Martin, holds up the Micro Fluidic chip from their Rapid DNA Identification system now in Beta 2 testing, in Gaithersburg on Nov. 18, 2011. Read “DNA: The next big hacking frontier”
Jeffrey MacMillan
#5 - Immigration
When it comes to reading about innovation, immigration was a popular topic. Washington Post columnist Vivek Wadhwa wrote that, on immigration, the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, had taken a step in the right direction. This prompted commenter “richard36” to write: “Until the issue of border control and deportation of illegal aliens is resolved, nothing should happen in the area of new immigration laws. Let's clean house and secure the borders, first.” In this photo, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano flies from New Mexico to Nogales, Ariz. Read “On immigration, a step in the right direction”

#4 - The Aakash
In a guest piece, Venture Beat’s Chikodi Chima reviewed the $35 tablet, prompting commenter ”Chortling_Heel” to write: “While I hope this works out well, it looks to be too big for a smart phone and too small (and slow) for a personal computing device. “ In this photo, Indian students pose with the Aakash Tablet computers they received during its launch in New Delhi on Oct. 5, 2011. Read “Hands On: India’s $35 Android table, the Aakash, lands in America.”

#3 - The Asus Transformer
When it came to technology, tablets ruled. Washington Post Co. senior vice president and chief digital officer Vijay Ravindran reviewed the Asus Eee Pad Transformer, prompting some heated responses. Commenter “xlrp3” summed it up best, “Asus? Triumphing over APPLE? This is not simply a joke in poor taste: it is also heresy.” In this photo, Asus International chief executive Jonney Shih presents the Asus Eee Pad Transformer. Read “How Asus triumphed over Apple.”

#2 - Fearing China
Readers were very interested to know what, exactly, they should fear about China. Post columnist Vivek Wadhwa broke down why U.S. policy makers are “right to worry,” prompting commenter “extateo5” to write, “I hate to say it but their youth is hungry and working hard to earn all the things our youth are given for just being.” In this photo, a sales representative poses behind a nine-tael 24K gold in the shape of a dragon forming the numerals "2012", symbolizing the upcoming Year of the Dragon at a Chow Tai Fook Jewellery store in Hong Kong on Dec. 6, 2011. Read “What we should really fear about China”

#1 - All you want is love
This year, readers loved reading about love. David Linden, author of “The Compass of Pleasure,” hit a nerve this year writing about our brains on love and addiction. The piece prompted commenter “jamesls” to write: “Mating and the rearing of offspring is not an evolutionarily new phenomenon. In many important ways, we humans may not be that original!” In this photo, women participate in the Running of the Brides at Filene’s Basement in Washington on April 29, 2011.

Prince William and Catherine emerge from hospital to show newborn prince, head home
View Photo Gallery — Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, gives birth to a boy: Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, went into labor and was admitted to a west London hospital Monday for the much-anticipated birth of a royal baby, descended from kings and coal miners and third in line to the British throne. By Anthony Faiola, E-mail the writer
LONDON — Under dim skies illuminated by a blitz of camera flashes, Prince William and his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, stepped out of the Lindo Wing of St. Mary’s Hospital on Tuesday and introduced their day-old prince to the glare of a media spotlight that he will probably never leave.
“He’s got her looks, thankfully,” a cheerful William told reporters as he held the baby in his arms. The press then set him up, asking the balding father whether his son had hair. “He’s got way more than me, thank God.”

Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William stepped outside St. Mary’s Hospital for the world’s first look at their new son. The royal baby: A bouncing bundle of international obsession
Monica Hesse A royal baby. A much-anticipated baby. A celebrity baby. But “an important baby?” Really?
Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, gives birth to a boy
Anthony Faiola Prince William’s wife gave birth at 4:24 p.m. London time, palace officials said.
Brits put cash in the royal baby book
Karla Adam Odds are that England’s next heir will be a girl named Alexandra, say the bettors.
Looking robust in a blue dress after giving birth a day earlier, Catherine cradled the baby in her arms and waved. As she did, a tiny hand emerged from the swaddling as if waving, too. William, who is said to hate the news media — blaming them for his mother’s death in a 1997 Paris car crash — fielded most of the questions on inquiring minds, possibly, in the most winsome of ways, trying to draw the news media off his wife. Who had changed the first royal nappy? Well, he had. What about the name? They’re working on it. “It’s the first time we’ve seen him, so we are having a proper chance to catch up.”As the little prince wailed, William joked that the baby had a “good set of lungs” and that he would one day remind the “big boy” of his tardiness — Catherine delivered after being some days overdue.Such moments — the first photo op of a baby who stands to one day be the monarch — have the weight of history here. Images of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prince Charles walking out of the same wing of the same hospital with Prince William in their arms are remembered by some as vividly now as then. But if that moment 31 years ago had a hint of formal awkwardness about it, Tuesday’s 31
/
2-minute meet-and-greet will perhaps be remembered for the casualness of a young couple in love. The subtle, if not wholly accurate message: The monarchy is now not so different from you.Some in the crowd of well-wishers, such as Andrea Dawkins, a 37-year-old from London, were immediately hooked (not that they needed much convincing).“They looked very happy,” said Dawkins, who screamed “I love you” as the couple emerged with the baby. “Kate passed the baby over to William, and there was such passion between him and his son. You can’t forget that moment, ever.”The baby unveiling, however, also hinted at the long road ahead for the littlest royal and the news media. In the most telling sign that William was gambling on the occasional photo op to slake the media’s thirst and buy his young family some privacy, he seemed to address the hundreds of journalists present when he said, “I know how long you’ve all been standing out here, so hopefully the hospital and you guys can all go back to normal now and we can look after him.”Normal? Fat chance, some said. “Short of going into exile, the third in line to the throne cannot expect to enjoy the slightest privacy,” Simon Jenkins, a British journalist and author, observed in a column for the Guardian newspaper after Tuesday’s glimpse of the little prince. “He will spend his life with a media drone hovering overhead, listening, prying, revealing, proclaiming a global ‘public interest’ in intrusion.”But, observers said, Tuesday’s moment was as much about duty, even for a day-old heir. In London, it was impossible to forget this was no normal baby. The bells of Westminster Abbey — the church where William and Catherine were married — tolled for three hours to honor the newborn. The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery rode past Buckingham Palace, offering a 41-gun salute to the baby prince, while the Army Reserve Regiment fired a 62-gun salute from the Tower of London’s Gun Wharf. British newspapers printed souvenir editions, and the cheeky, top-selling tabloid the Sun changed its masthead to read “The Son.” Congratulations continued to pour in from foreign governments, suggesting the soft power the royal family lends Britain around the globe. Even Iran — which has dubbed Britain the “little Satan” — offered its congratulations to “Her Majesty, the Queen of England, and also the Crown Prince on the birth.” “This is a source of happiness,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Teheran, according to Agence France-Presse.Before the royal couple exited the hospital, they had visits from the cheerful grandparents. “He’s absolutely beautiful,” said Carole Middleton, Catherine’s mother, who seemed slightly dazed by the barking orders of photographers. Her first cuddle with the baby, she told reporters, was “amazing.” Asked whether she had offered any suggestions for the baby’s name, she demurred. “Absolutely not,” she said.Next came Charles, and his second wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Charles smiled and waved to the photographers and well-wishers who had staked out space outside the hospital for weeks to await the public debut of the baby prince. The eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, Charles is first in line to succeed her, followed by his own first-born, William, and then William’s newborn son.“Everything’s marvelous. You’ll see in a minute,” Charles said while exiting the hospital with his wife, suggesting that the debut of the newest heir to the throne was imminent. Interpreting William’s seemingly warm engagement with the news media Tuesday, Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty Magazine, said, “You embrace the enemy.”“He did really well today,” she continued. “I think in his mind he has done the deal. He’s given the picture and now expects they leave him alone.” Karla Adam in London and William Branigin in Washington contributed to this report.
