(Scott Suchman/ Shakespeare Theatre Company ) - Shakespeare Theatre Company set “Much Ado About Nothing,” with Phil Hosford, Floyd King, Aayush Chandan and Jacob Perkins, in 1930s Cuba and drew criticism for changing characters’ names into what some perceived as ethnic stereotypes.

Free admission Get ideas It is the fashion in these meddling times — now perhaps more than ever — to put the doublets in mothballs and tie up Shakespeare in the threads of ponderous context. Only cursory consideration seems to be given in Washington or Baltimore, London or New York to whether it makes sense to dress Petruchio in chaps or Macbeth’s witches in the aprons of abattoir workers. To transport Lear to the heath of “Waiting For Godot” or Shylock to a tenement on the Lower East Side. To decide that Messina is not on Sicily but a stone’s throw from Havana, or that the Rome of “Julius Caesar” was actually meant to be the Baghdad of Saddam Hussein.Yes, somehow, a consensus has been reached that William Shakespeare was not a playwright but a time-travel agent, one whose points of geographic and temporal reference were meant as mere suggestions. A milestone of sorts was achieved this season at Washington’s Tony Award-winning Shakespeare Theatre Company, where all three of its Shakespeare productions — “Much Ado About Nothing,” “The Two Gentlemen of Verona” and current “The Merry Wives of Windsor” — have been set, with wildly varying degrees of success, in the century between 1915 and now.The city’s other influential outlet for Shakespeare, the Folger Theatre, has proved just as seducible by directors lugging in their conceptual baggage. A rootin’, tootin’ “The Taming of the Shrew,” set in the Old West, just finished a run in its Capitol Hill playhouse, where one would have been forgiven for wondering why angry Kate didn’t use her trusty gun, or how Padua wound up being a suburb of Tombstone. The scouting for unique environments in which to speak in iambic pentameter goes on apace in other major cities: Witness the arch and overpraised new “As You Like It” in New York’s Central Park, set in the wilderness of mid-19th-century America, with banjo-picking exiles from the court — in this case, a fort like those eternally under attack in vintage cowboy-and-Indian flicks.The fussing with the cosmetics of Shakespeare has become so routine that it is a shock to more devoted patrons of the Bard when any of his plays are performed these days in both the time and place the author intended them. Has a belief taken hold that only by placing Shakespeare’s characters in elaborate disguise can a contemporary theatergoer view them as relevant? The compulsive tinkering yields distressing side effects. Distracted audiences can not only lose touch with the pleasure of listening to Shakespeare’s language but also may become less able to distinguish clearly the worthier attempts at innovation. The application, for instance, of anachronism to enlarge a theme can be a very useful tool, one that director Rebecca Bayla Taichman employed to fine effect in her abstracted updating of “The Taming of the Shrew” at Shakespeare Theatre in 2007. The difference here was in a director, challenging “Shrew’s” antiquated view of women, who carefully chose a dim sum of modern references that helped us see where attitudes have (or haven’t) evolved since Shakespeare’s time. In the cases of Shakespeare’s broader comedies, where the expectation expands for some degree of absurdity, the demand for rigorous logic recedes. This is partly why director Michael Kahn’s psychedelic Beatles-inspired “Love’s Labor’s Lost” in 2006 proved so easy to digest — and like. Certainly, the exuberant elasticity of Shakespeare’s brain, and the sometimes fantastic landscapes he conjured, for places he’d never been — the enchanted island of “The Tempest”; the Alexandria of “Antony and Cleopatra” — justifiably electrify the creative impulses of directors and designers. I have no desire to curb the fertile dreamers of the theater. Sometimes a play fairly seamlessly accommodates a temporal transfer, as director Stephen Rayne accomplishes in his “Merry Wives,” by retaining the evocative English milieu of Windsor and simply pushing the era forward to World War I. And for the purposes of introducing the youngest to Shakespeare, some artful analogizing is useful, as the playwright Ken Ludwig has demonstrated, in adapting Shakespeare for high school drama clubs. What I pine for, though, is for dreaming to be tailored a bit more conscientiously to the contours of the plays — and common sense.How far from sense the ideas can veer was illustrated in Shakespeare Theatre Company’s recent transposition of “Much Ado About Nothing” to a hacienda in 1930s Cuba. Director Ethan McSweeny’s overly specific reinterpretation not only compelled an audience into a contrived cultural framework but also committed the clumsy error of translating characters’ names into what some perceived as ethnic stereotypes. The low characters Hugh Oatcake and George Seacoal became Juan Huevos and Jose Frijoles. After protests were raised, many of them by Latino artists, the production sensibly reverted to the original Shakespearean names.As in Aaron Posner’s Wild West “Shrew” at Folger, it erred by hewing so faithfully to a concept that it was drained of an ineffable essence of authenticity.My sneaking suspicion is that the mania for transporting a Rosalind or a Richard III to a newfangled forest or kingdom may sometimes be an anxious reflex, a product of a general unease in contemporary theater over the rigors of speaking the verse and fully illuminating character. What better way to take some of the pressure off a cast’s uneven vocal skills than to plop actors into realms in which the flatness of speech more easily echoes that of our own?Some of the problems of transposition can be mitigated by actors of elite skill; Ian Merrill Peakes, whose range at Folger has encompassed both Iago and Henry VIII, comes to mind as an interpreter of Shakespeare who transcends concept; there is an invisibility to his technique —and a confidence with the language — that allows him to be absorbed into any scenario. For me, though, the ultimate in high-concept Shakespeare is a stripping away of all concept, epitomized by director Trevor Nunn’s extraordinary “Macbeth” with Judi Dench and Ian McKellen, way back in 1976. I’ve never again felt the minds of Elizabethan villains opened so nakedly before me.Perhaps it’s the perpetual yearning for Shakespeare with that kind of sizzling immediacy that fuels my impatience with the intrusive global bunting that’s draped over his plays. And maybe that’s why my recent visit to Staunton, Va.’s American Shakespeare Center, where the staging is crisp and unvarnished, felt like such a tonic. In any event, I’m not holding my breath for a wholesale shift to bare-bones stagings and simpler dramatic virtues. The next time Verona looks like Vegas, or Viola pulls up in a Volvo, I’ll merely chalk it up to the same old, same old.

Big banks’ dangerous monopoly on life
By Harold Meyerson, E-mail the writer
In 1909, as one of the scores of short pictures he turned out that year, D.W. Griffith directed “A Corner in Wheat,” a 14-minute film adaptation of a story by the populist antitrust novelist Frank Norris. In it, a Wall Street speculator buys up so much of America’s wheat and keeps it off the market that prices soar and millions — including the farm family Griffith shows laboring in the fields — go hungry.
Americans’ long-standing apprehensions about banks getting control of the stuff of life are, as we’ve learned again in recent weeks, generally justified. The latest episode of Wall Street’s manipulation of commodity prices was revealed Sunday in a remarkable New York Times article by David Kocieniewski that showed how Goldman Sachs, just by warehousing 1.5 million tons of aluminum, has managed to raise the price of every beer and cola can the world over. Goldman doesn’t own the aluminum, yet in the best tradition of middlemen who add no value to the product but manage to nonetheless take a hefty cut, it owns a vast expanse of warehouses outside Detroit, where much of the nation’s aluminum is stored. And stored. And stored. Harold Meyerson

Blaming Obama first
Before Goldman bought the warehouses three years ago, the Times reported, aluminum ingots generally were kept in the warehouses for six weeks before being shipped to factories to be turned into goods. Now they linger on average for 16 months, during which Goldman collects a daily storage fee from the banks, hedge funds and traders who own the ingots — a fee that is factored into the metal’s spot-market price and that raises the price for all aluminum sold on that market, no matter where it’s stored. (Goldman thoughtfully pays those traders a premium so they won’t suffer too much from the lengthy rentals.) Regulations imposed by the London Metals Exchange — which until last year was owned by banks, including Goldman and Barclays, that are its members — say that an ingot can remain in a particular warehouse for only a certain period, so Goldman employs truckers to move the ingots from one warehouse to the next in its vast storage yard. This is capitalism straight out of Frank Norris — or Franz Kafka.Aluminum isn’t the only commodity that banks are cornering. JPMorgan Chase is facing a reported $500 million fine by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for allegedly manipulating California and Michigan energy markets. Earlier this month, the commission fined Barclays $435 million for similar transgressions in California. In the former case, the FERC claims that JPMorgan’s energy traders misrepresented the price of electricity contracts, which led to the states’ electricity buyers — and, ultimately, consumers — overpaying power plants that the company owned. It’s Enron revisited, albeit on a more modest scale. Bank control of the commodity markets is both an old and new phenomenon. It was commonplace when Griffith made “A Corner in Wheat.” Four years later, in 1913, future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis noted with alarm that “investment bankers” had become “the directing power in railroads, public service and industrial companies.” In 1956, however, after the New Deal reined in big banks’ power and abuses, Congress passed and President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Bank Holding Company Act, which limited banks’ investments to other related financial entities. In the 1990s — a decade in which banks grew to dominate the U.S. economy — the Bank Holding Company Act was effectively undone. Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which amended the 1956 law to permit banks to establish financial holding companies and gave the Federal Reserve authority to designate the kind of firms that these companies could invest in or purchase outright. In those halcyon Greenspan days — and even in some subsequent Bernanke days — the Fed approved Wall Street’s investments in commodities and a whole lot else. Indeed, in a Senate Banking Committee hearing Tuesday, Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown reported that “the six largest U.S. bank holding companies have 14,420 subsidiaries, only 19 of which are traditional banks.” The threat this poses to Americans and the U.S. economy is twofold. First, banks hold the ability to jack up prices on life’s essentials. Second, since giant, publicly insured banks such as JPMorgan Chase are investing in all manner of businesses and markets, taxpayers would be on the hook if those businesses and markets should tank. That’s why we need to bring back something like the Glass-Steagall Act, which built a wall between depositor banks and investment banks, and the 1956 Bank Holding Company Act. Otherwise, Wall Street will continue to corner both matter and energy. Read more from Harold Meyerson’s archive or follow him on Twitter.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
The Post’s View
In Maryland, marijuana possession gets a more fitting penalty
By Editorial Board, THE MARYLAND Senate’s vote to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana would not, as some critics warn, make it okay to use the drug. Such use would still be illegal, but it would be a civil offense, punishable by fines rather than imprisonment. Not only would this save law enforcement valuable resources but also prevent the lives of many young people from being ruined. We hope the House of Delegates follows the Senate’s lead and that Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) signs this sensible measure into law.
The billpassed the Senate on a 30 to 16 vote Tuesday. People now caught with up to 10 grams of marijuana, about one-third of an ounce, may face up to 90 days in jail and a fine up to $500; the Senate proposal would eliminate any jail time and provide for a fine up to $100. The reduction from a criminal misdemeanor is aimed at recreational users of marijuana, not those who traffic in illegal drug sales. The lopsided, bipartisan vote in favor of the change is a reflection of the changing attitudes about marijuana and the unintended costs of strict anti-pot laws. More than a dozen states have decriminalized small amounts of marijuana possession, and some have gone so far as to legalize the drug for various uses. Bills that would have Maryland join states such as Colorado and Washington in legalizing the drug for various uses are also pending in Annapolis, but they are unlikely to advance because of justifiable concerns about being at odds with federal law.

Editorial Board An impasse in Richmond over expanded health insurance for the poor is driven by ideology, not facts.
Apply the brakes
Editorial Board The Secret Service needs to avoid so many main road closures.
Decriminalization poses no such conflict and would, as its sponsor, Sen. Robert A. Zirkin (D-Baltimore County), pointed out, eliminate “a tremendous waste of resources.” There were more than 24,000 arrests last year in Maryland for marijuana possession, according to Dan Riffle of the Marijuana Policy Project, who argued that the time spent processing those arrests could be better spent on other, more serious crimes. Equally significant is the fact that most of those arrested are young people, predominantly African Americans, who end up with the taint of a criminal charge that makes it harder for them to get a job, stay in school or resist getting involved in more serious crimes.Opponents of decriminalization worry about the “message” that would be sent. Concerns about the risks associated with marijuana abuse cannot be discounted and — just as with liquor and cigarettes — young people should be discouraged from its use. But wasted resources and ruined lives are too high a price to pay for sending a message that can still be delivered with more appropriate and reasonable penalties. Reprints

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Baucus retirement opens way for sweeping legislative changes
View Photo Gallery — The Fix’s top 10 Senate races of 2014: The 2014 midterm elections are just around the corner. These are the races to watch. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP) By Paul Kane and Lori Montgomery, Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), one of the most influential congressional figures of his era, announced his intention Tuesday to retire, a move that could produce sweeping changes in the political and legislative landscape over the next two years.
The announcement could mark the beginning of one of the most consequential periods in Baucus’s long public career, because he pledged to devote the rest of his time in Washington to pursuing a comprehensive rewrite of the federal tax code, a long-shot effort that many see as key to breaking the fiscal gridlock that has paralyzed Washington in recent years.

That paralysis of taxes and spending has been a central feature of Obama’s presidency, and Baucus said that when the president called him Tuesday about his retirement, Baucus quickly turned the discussion to tax reform. “They’re going to get tired of me,” Baucus said in an interview, adding that White House officials are still searching for a strategy for ending the stalemate. Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax issues, said his decision not to seek reelection frees him from the demands of a campaign and will also allow him to focus on new trade agreements and implementation of the Obama health-care initiative, which he played a major role in drafting. Baucus at some times has been a key Obama ally and at others a thorn in his side. Shortly after Obama took office, Baucus crafted large portions of the massive 2009 economic stimulus package and played a key role in drafting the president’s health-care plan. Last week he opposed Obama’s gun-control proposal, the failure of which was a crushing defeat for the president.Baucus defended his gun vote as a representation of his state’s libertarian views, adding that nobody from the White House or the Democratic leadership tried to get him to vote the other way. “I didn’t get my arm twisted by anybody on that. Because that’s Montana,” Baucus said. “I have a sign on my desk: ‘Montana comes first.’ ” Baucus infuriated Democratic colleagues in 2001, just ahead of a potentially tough reelection fight, when he worked with Republicans to write one of the largest tax cuts in American history just months after George W. Bush won the White House. In 2003, he helped Bush pass his Medicare prescription drug plan, but in 2005, he led the opposition to Bush’s effort to partially privatize Social Security.Baucus, 71, has spent most of his adult life in Washington, having been elected to the House in 1974 and to the Senate in 1978. He explained his decision to retire in squarely personal terms, saying he had been wrestling with the idea since his mother died just over a year ago.“It made me realize I’m not immortal. We’re all mortals,” Baucus said. “I don’t want to leave here when I’m 80 years old. There are things I want to do. . . . I want to see what life is like outside the United States Senate.”With more than $5 million already in his campaign war chest, Baucus had been aggressively raising funds for reelection in a state that gave Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney a 13-percentage-point victory in 2012. “It’s a big loss for the Senate,” said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). He drafted the 2001 tax cuts and the Medicare law with Baucus, who has been the top Democrat on the Finance Committee since 2001. Baucus became the fifth Senate committee chairman, with more than 140 combined years of experience, to announce his intention to retire next year. The others include John D. Rockefeller IV, (D-W.Va.), 75, chairman of the commerce committee, and Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), 73, chairman of the health committee. In recent years, longtime committee chairmen Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) died in office.The retirements have given Republicans several openings in next year’s midterm elections, in which they currently need a six-seat gain to reclaim a majority they lost in the 2006 election. Democrats immediately began courting former Montana governor Brian D. Schweitzer, who has honed an image as a Mountain West populist, to run for Baucus’s seat. Republicans had been trying to land a top recruit to challenge Baucus, who despite his unpolished public image has repeatedly won tough reelection battles. The state’s at-large congressman, Rep. Steve Daines (R), is believed to be considering running for the open seat. Another measure of Baucus’s influence is that many of his former staffers became some of the most influential political advisers and K Street lobbyists, establishing an alumni network that is the envy of many congressional offices and the object of derision by ethics watchdogs. Jim Messina, Obama’s 2012 campaign manager, rose through the ranks of Montana politics at Baucus’s side.The Baucus announcement sent lobbyists scrambling to learn who will fill the chairmanship of the Finance Committee, with its oversight of tax, trade and entitlement policy. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a liberal with an independent streak, is next in line.The constraints on chairmen have grown evident over the past two years, especially as Obama and congressional party leaders have strayed repeatedly into territory traditionally governed by the Finance Committee. Since January, Baucus has been in an open feud with Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) over tax reform, arguing that a Democratic proposal to raise nearly $1 trillion in fresh revenue over the next decade is excessive and unworkable.Instead, Baucus has declared his intention to work with Republicans on a rewrite of the tax code. The revised code would eliminate loopholes and deductions and use the new revenue to lower tax rates, as Republicans desire, and to reduce the deficit, as Democrats demand.In recent months, Baucus has worked with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.), who shares his enthusiasm for tax reform. With Camp facing a term limit on his chairmanship next year, aides said both chairmen have a rare sense of freedom in an era when power is concentrated in the offices of Reid and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).Inside the Democratic caucus, many junior Democrats have chafed at Baucus’s power, pushing the leadership to rein him in, and some have even promoted the prospect of imposing term limits on Senate chairmen. Those proposals have been brushed aside by Reid’s leadership team.Baucus’s advisers said he was not afraid of running another tough race. But in one clear signal that he was ready to go, Baucus and his wife, Melodee, have recently begun building what they call their “dream home” outside Bozeman, Mont. Additionally, several of his closest advisers left their senior positions in recent months for private-sector jobs.Republican strategists began circulating stories about Schweitzer and his work stumping for Obama immediately after The Washington Post broke the news about Baucus’s retirement. Democrats rejected the idea that tying Schweitzer — or any Montana Democrat — to Obama would suffice to defeat him, citing the string of Senate victories for Democrats there that included the 2012 victory of Sen. Jon Tester.Despite Obama’s double-digit defeat in Montana, Democrats intend to vigorously defend the seat.“Democrats have had a great deal of electoral success in Montana over the last decade, and I am confident that will continue,” Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.), chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a statement.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
One nation, under God — at least through breakfast
By Melinda Henneberger, E-mail the writer
Republicans and Democrats prayed for the president and one another at Thursday’s National Prayer Breakfast, where Rep. Janice Hahn (D-Calif.) laughingly suggested that her friendship with Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) might prove the existence of God, because nothing else could explain it.
Gohmert, who co-chaired the annual event with Hahn, sallied that “it’s easy to pray with people who are wrong on the issues when you have a common heart.”

In its 62nd year, the breakfast is a D.C. institution, church and state joining hands for a couple of hours at the Washington Hilton, where President Ronald Reagan was shot and the White House Correspondents’ Dinner holds its “nerd prom” every spring. Official Washington is expected to attend, and does; Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John F. Kerry were in the crowd of 3,200 this year, as was President Michel Martelly of Haiti and President Bujar Nishani of Albania. Every American president has done so since Eisenhower, in 1953, told those present, “You can’t explain free government in any other terms than religious.”A non-believing president — or even one who prefers private demonstrations of faith — might not be entirely comfortable at the service, in which God is invoked and the politics of religion mostly go unmentioned. In the beginning were the jokes: “I, by the way, have always found Louie to be unbelievably gracious,’’ President Obama said, adding, “I don’t watch TV, I’ve got to admit.’’The crowd itself was on the saucy side; the man on my right in the overflow ballroom, where the morning’s speakers appeared up close and in high definition, volunteered that he was struck by how much the White House ages every POTUS and FLOTUS, while the man on my left exclaimed, “What did they do with her eyebrows?” Even the scrambled eggs and paprika potatoes were roasted from the dais: After Gohmert broke Julia Child’s rule — never speak ill of the food you’re serving — Hahn reminded him that their guests had paid big bucks for it, and he sighed, “I wish it really was true that you get what you pay for.”But unembarrassed prayers were offered, too, and as the first lady nodded encouragement, Bethany Hamilton, the author of “Soul Surfer,” spoke about how losing her arm in a shark attack had given her the chance to help kids with cancer. The keynote speaker, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah, urged those present to end extreme poverty in our lifetime, and he became emotional as he told the story of a woman forced by famine, rather than the Nazis, to make the kind of “Sophie’s Choice’’ described in William Styron’s novel. At a Somali refugee camp, Shah said, he met a mother who’d been traveling with her two children, carrying them one at a time until it became clear that they would all die unless she put one down: “She looked down at her two children and said a prayer, then she made the excruciating decision to leave one of them behind so she could save the other.”When the president’s turn came, he asked God to bless our men and women in uniform and “one colleague of mine who is missing today. A great friend of mine who I came into the Senate with, Senator Tom Coburn,’’ who has cancer. “Tom is going through some tough times right now, but I love him dearly, even though we’re from different parties. He’s a little closer to Louie’s political perspective than mine, but he is a good man, and I’m keeping him and his family in my prayers all the time. So just a shout-out to my good friend, Tom Coburn.”Sometimes, when critics say that the president doesn’t speak openly about his faith, I feel guilty, because he does, and we just don’t quote him.“Each time we gather,’’ he said at the breakfast, “it’s a chance to set aside the rush of our daily lives; to pause with humility before an Almighty God; to seek his grace; and, mindful of our own imperfections, to remember the admonition from the Book of Romans, which is especially fitting for those of us in Washington: ‘Do not claim to be wiser than you are.’ ”It was God, the president said, who “directed my path to Chicago and my work with churches who were intent on breaking the cycle of poverty in hard-hit communities there. And I’m grateful not only because I was broke and the church fed me, but because it led to everything else. It led me to embrace Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. It led me to Michelle, the love of my life, and it blessed us with two extraordinary daughters. It led me to public service. And the longer I serve, especially in moments of trial or doubt, the more thankful I am of God’s guiding hand.”He spoke of the work done by faith-based groups and the inspiration he’s drawn from leaders of other faiths, adding that, “I am especially looking forward to returning to the Vatican next month to meet His Holiness, Pope Francis, whose message about caring for the ‘least of these’ is one that I hope all of us heed.’’He ended with a defense of the religious liberty that some Catholics and other Christians feel that his contraception mandate effectively denies them, though he naturally said nothing about that. As the faithful filed out of the ballroom, several people said that having the president pray with them meant something. “Most of the people here lean toward a conservative mind-set,’’ — himself included, said George Peart, who is in wastewater-treatment equipment sales in Madison, Miss. But, he said, Obama “professes a relationship to Christ, and I love his humanity.’’
