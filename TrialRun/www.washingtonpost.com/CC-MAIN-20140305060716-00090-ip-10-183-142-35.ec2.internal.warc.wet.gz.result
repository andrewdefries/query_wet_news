The week ahead for traffic, transit
By Robert Thomson
The Capital Weather Gang notes that Wednesday is the last day of the meteorological winter, but travelers probably will have that spring-like feeling on Monday and Tuesday. The latter part of the week, though, will bring rain and clouds.
Drivers in Virginia will be adjusting to some important changes along the 495 Express Lanes work zone in the Tysons Corner area. Drivers in D.C. should note the disruption in the Dupont Circle traffic signals scheduled for Tuesday, as well as midday closings on Beach Drive. Metro riders face some off-peak delays this week, and a big disruption on the Red Line this weekend.
Metro’s weekday maintenance
Metro plans to work on all lines but the Yellow Line during off-peak periods this week.
Red Line: From 10 p.m. to the train system’s midnight closing Monday through Thursday, trains will share a track between Takoma and Forest Glen. The trains will leave their terminals about every 22 minutes. Metro advises riders to allow 10 to 15 minutes for extra travel time.
Orange Line: From 10 p.m to midnight Monday through Thursday, trains will share a track between East Falls Church and West Falls Church and between Eastern Market and Stadium-Armory. Add about 20 minutes to normal travel times.
Blue Line: From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays, trains will share a track between Foggy Bottom and Arlington Cemetery. From 10 p.m. to midnight Monday through Thursday, trains will share a track between Eastern Market and Stadium-Armory. Add about 20 minutes to normal travel times.
Green Line: From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays, trains will share a track between Southern Avenue and Naylor Road. Add about 10 minutes to normal travel times.
Dupont Circle signals
About 10 a.m. Tuesday, the District Department of Transportation plans to cut power to the traffic-control signals at Dupont Circle for several hours so they can be upgraded. They will be back on in time for the afternoon rush, DDOT said.
During the outage, watch for the traffic-control officers directing drivers through 19th Street, P Street, New Hampshire Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue and Connecticut Avenue NW. It would be best to avoid this busy area during the disruption.
DDOT conducted a similar operation for a signal upgrade last week at Logan Circle.
Beltway/Route 7
Drivers in the Tysons Corner area will have to pay attention to a change in the traffic pattern where Route 7 (Leesburg Pike) meets the Beltway. The Virginia Department of Transportation is closing the right-side exit from eastbound Route 7 to the Beltway’s inner loop. Drivers who want to go north on the Beltway will need to stay left. They will encounter a new traffic signal that will allow them to make a left turn onto the inner loop ramp.
Drivers heading west on Route 7 won’t have to learn a new exit strategy, but they will need to pay attention to that traffic signal controlling the left turn. This is a permanent change for the 495 Express Lanes project. But it’s not quite the final configuration. Later this year, a second left-turn lane will be added.
Beltway/I-66
The Virginia Department of Transportation developed this fix for the traffic congestion on the Beltway’s outer loop at the ramp to westbound Interstate 66: (1) Restore the Exit 49 ramp on the outer loop of the Capital Beltway at I-66 to two lanes, and (2) add a fifth lane along I-66 west at the interchange.
The new configuration in this work zone for the 495 Express Lanes is scheduled to remain until the interchange is done in the fall. The Express Lanes are scheduled to open by the end of the year.
The extra congestion of the past several weeks began when the work zone was adjusted. That narrowed the outer loop ramp to I-66 west to ease traffic congestion on the other side of the Beltway and along I-66 in the area of the interchange.
But then the outer loop traffic sometimes backed up to the American Legion Bridge. The congestion and VDOT’s efforts to fix the problem were the subject of my Feb. 19 Commuter page feature, so write to me at drgridlock@washpost.com and tell me whether the fix is working for you.
Route 450 lane narrowing
The Maryland State Highway Administration is replacing a damaged stormwater pipe under Route 450 (Defense Highway) just east of Route 424 (Davidsonville Road), between Nob Hill Drive and Hermitage Hills Drive in Anne Arundel County.
Watch for flaggers directing traffic through the narrowed work zone and expect delays between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. This should end by Friday, weather permitting.
Dulles Metrorail/Tysons Boulevard
The eastbound lanes of Tysons Boulevard will be closed between Chain Bridge Road (Route 123) and Galleria Drive each night through Friday. Crews on the Dulles Silver Line project are working on the station, bridge and piers in that area in the middle of Tysons Corner.
This also requires the closing of the turn lanes onto eastbound Tysons Boulevard from northbound Chain Bridge Road and from Galleria Drive.
The closings will occur from 9:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. each night.
Constitution Avenue NW
From 5:30 a.m to 7 p.m. weekdays, the eastbound curb lane of Constitution Avenue NW may be closed between 17th and 15th streets for installation of fence posts and chain, part of the National Park Service roadway renovation. Parking will be restricted on the eastbound side. No night work is scheduled this week.
Beach Drive
The National Park Service says maintenance workers will be removing trees in Rock Creek Park next to Beach Drive. From 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, Beach Drive will be closed between the park police substation at Joyce Road and Broad Branch Road to create a safe work zone.
Metro delays this weekend
The main event in Metro’s track work for this coming weekend is a split on the Red Line. Buses are scheduled to replace trains between Shady Grove and White Flint. The Rockville, Twinbrook and Shady Grove stations will be closed. Workers will be replacing track circuits and doing other track rehabilitation projects in that zone.

By Michael Dirda, E-mail the writer
Well, there are poetry-writing classes, and then there’s the 1959 poetry-writing class taught by Robert Lowell at Boston University, with Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton among the students. Kathleen Spivack was there, too, and she re-creates those heady days in her memoir, “With Robert Lowell and His Circle.” She also recalls her subsequent encounters with Elizabeth Bishop (with whom she regularly played ping-pong) and Adrienne Rich; the mentorship of Stanley Kunitz and John Malcolm Brinnin (author of the classic “Dylan Thomas in America”); her friendship with Lowell’s wives, the writers Elizabeth Hardwick and Caroline Blackwood; and the early brilliance of the critic Helen Vendler. There are, as well, strobe-light glimpses of several contemporary poets in their youth, including Robert Pinsky and Frank Bidart.
It’s quite an array of talent, and Spivack, grateful to count most of these peoples as friends, writes about them with an almost girlish enthusiasm. I haven’t seen quite so many exclamation points in one book in a long time. Spivack, moreover, can be winningly guileless: “I had come to study with Lowell, but I did not understand a word of his early work, Lord ­Weary’s Castle.” More problematic, however, is her memoir’s tiresome repetitiveness. This results, I suspect, because the chapters originally appeared as separate articles and were never refitted into a single, smooth narrative. Closer editing would have made this enjoyable but ramshackle book into a much better one.

Free admission Get ideas Spivack was born into a cultivated family that fled Nazi Europe in the 1930s. In America, after considerable early effort, her father, Peter Drucker, eventually made himself into the now almost legendary guru of modern management. Being a wise parent, he naturally sent his oldest daughter to Oberlin College, where she won a fellowship for her senior year. Spivack decided to use the money to study with a major poet.She was first drawn to Allen Ginsberg, but the beatnik author of “Howl” was totally unacceptable to Oberlin’s English department. Then she wrote to that scion of Boston brahmins, Robert Lowell, who agreed to mentor her. Nonetheless, when she knocked on his office door at BU in the early fall of 1959, the poet was utterly nonplussed:“ ‘Who are you?’ he queried mildly. He was eating his lunch, and looking abstracted. I had arrived in a rainstorm, in blue jeans and boots. ‘I never take anyone under thirty,’ he countered coldly. He didn’t remember getting my letter, or the arrangement with Oberlin. I was stunned. As I stood in the crowded office, wet and depressed, not knowing quite how to handle his amnesia, Lowell took pity on me. ‘Would you like part of this sandwich?’ he offered.”As Spivack came to learn, Lowell often chose his female students by their looks and, from the photographic evidence, Spivack was a darkly attractive young woman. In any case, the poet relented and invited her to sit in with his class and even to come by for private tutorials at his home. Despite some flirtation on both sides, the two apparently managed to stay just friends, master and disciple, until Lowell’s death at 60 in 1977.Lowell began that fall’s class by asking the students to name their favorite poet. Spivack answered Edna St. Vincent Millay. “Lowell cleared his throat, there was a long and awkward silence, and without comment the class proceeded as if nothing had been said.” The woman sitting next to her, Spivack recalls, “was ‘astonishing in her stillness,’ as she was to write later. Sylvia Plath appeared perfectly composed, quiet, fixed in her concentration. She was softly pretty, her camel’s hair coat slung over the back of her chair, and a pile of books in front of her.” To Spivack, she “presented herself rather like what I imagined an English boarding school ‘Head Girl’ to be.”Lowell’s teaching was eccentric and largely “rhetorical, as if the class were a frame for the expansion of his own opinions.” He would repeatedly ask, “What does this poem really mean?” There would follow “long, agonized silences, while the class held its collective breath and hoped to come up with adequate answers.” Again and again, Lowell would bring up living poets and then quiz: “Major or minor?” Even his close friend Elizabeth Bishop was sadly declared “minor,” but “almost major.” Sometimes, when on the verge of one of his periodic breakdowns, Lowell could turn incredibly mean: “Don’t ever write again,” he told one young woman, after “decimating” her poem. She burst into tears and ran from the classroom.During the course, and over the years following, Spivack grew especially close to Anne Sexton: “She was most often supportive. ‘I love this, I love this!’ she would exclaim over a line. Then the dreaded ‘Kathy, may I steal it?’ This was, she felt, her ultimate compliment. ‘Nooo!!!!’ I countered. What a horrible request! She had her own images to harvest, was the best image-maker there was.”Spivack writes feelingly about the plight of the female poet in those days. When the distinguished Muriel Rukeyser gave a reading at Harvard, not a single member of the almost entirely male English department bothered to attend. As to why there had been so few major women poets, Spivack wryly explains that “few women poets have had wives.” Sexton’s home represented a kind of oasis, a feminine retreat:“I remember swimming nude in the pool, looking at trees, and drinking Anne’s newest drink discovery, Champale, giggling over vague poetic jokes. Or drying off, sitting in the sun, reading each other’s poems. Maxine Kumin and her children would arrive. Maxine dove into the pool, cool, competent, and graceful. Anne, on Thorazine, would move a bit into the shade. The phone rang and was dragged outside. Anne’s children came home from school. The Dalmatian dragged its puppies outside. Figures were commented on: hips and waists. I had a baby. Lois [Ames] got her divorce. Maxine’s daughter entered Radcliffe. Anne’s children grew up. Poems were shared and magazines passed around. We wrote and wrote and read and revised and wrote. We read aloud to each other. Steam rose from the pool; the light grew thin; the leaves fell. And we swam until late October . . .”When Sexton and Bishop wanted to meet, it was Spivack who arranged a lunch. “ ‘Tell me, Anne,’ Elizabeth leaned over. ‘How much money do you get for a reading nowadays?’ ” The two famous poets proceeded to talk about “contracts and money and publishers who had or hadn’t done them wrong.” Along with such “Po-Biz,” Spivack touches on the bad love affairs, depression and drink that led many of her literary generation to suicide or early graves.Every poet longs, above all, to write in his or her own individual voice. Robert Lowell’s great contribution to his students, concludes Spivack, was nothing less than “to foster the discovery of voice in those with whom he worked.” That’s a lot harder than it sounds.

Lincoln Memorial shut down after vandals splash paint on it
View Photo Gallery — Unknown vandals smear paint on Lincoln Memorial: The Lincoln Memorial was shut down Friday morning after unknown vandals splashed the statue of the nation’s 16th president and the marble floor around it with green paint, U.S. Park Police said. By Maggie Fazeli Fard and Michael E. Ruane, E-mail the writers
At 10:13 a.m Friday, a policeman began taking down the yellow crime-scene tape at the Lincoln Memorial, and a wave of visitors surged up the steps to see the damage.
The upper chamber, where the 120-ton statue of Abraham Lincoln has sat for 91 years, was still roped off. But the people could see the pale-green paint splattered on the left pant leg and the bottom of the frock coat.

Photos: Vandalism at National Parks
A child said it looked like Play-Doh.But the statue was solid as always. The right foot, in a square-toe boot, slightly forward. The left hand closed. The white marble face, devoid of the ravages that the Civil War etched on the human face, looked east out over the Mall.The hallowed memorial was fully reopened at 6:30 p.m., many hours after someone splashed paint on the statue overnight and fled.The National Park Service said it was the first time that the majestic memorial was vandalized since its dedication in 1922 in the presence of Lincoln’s son, Robert. It was closed briefly after the 2011 earthquake.U.S. Park Police said they had opened an investigation but had no suspects. The police said the memorial is guarded during the overnight hours but declined to go into detail.The Park Service said paint that had landed on the floor of the chamber had been cleaned up by mid-afternoon.As for the statue, “there is still some residue on there,” said Carol Bradley Johnson, a spokeswoman for National Mall and Memorial Parks. “We’ll be back there Monday.”“We’re using gentle materials to remove it,” she said. “We’re still confident that there’ll be no damage that’s permanent.”Many visitors who gazed at the vandalism Friday seemed dumbfounded.Young people visiting for the first time appeared especially dismayed.“It’s disrespectful,” said Nicholas Flowers, 15, of Sunbury, Pa., as he stood at the entrance to the chamber. “That is probably one of the most rude things you can do to a great leader.”He was in town with a school group from Pennsylvania studying leadership.“This is probably one of the worst displays of leadership, because vandalism is just something that shouldn’t be okay,” he said.Keashla Marengo, 23, of Bloomsburg, Pa., said: “I think it’s terrible. I don’t know why someone would do that. It is very disrespectful. And, like Nick said, it does not show leadership at all.”Tamika Austin, 22, of Philadelphia, a senior at Bloomsburg University, said: “For my first visit, it’s kind of sad. To have to see this on my first time being here.”Johnson called the incident “heartbreaking.”“People come from all over the world to see [the monuments and memorials], and it’s just really disturbing that someone would do this,” she said. “The Park Service takes great pride in taking care of these national icons, and anything like this is devastating to us.”Scattered damage has plagued Washington’s statues and monuments over the years.The equestrian statue of Civil War Gen. George B. McClellan, at Connecticut Avenue and Columbia Road, is missing one of the original bronze shields around its base.The original stirrups on the 1853 equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square have been missing since the 1990s.And the D.C. War Memorial’s original metal floor medallion vanished years ago.In 1991, protesters dumped red paint on the statue of Christopher Columbus outside Union Station and wrote “500 years of genocide.”Seven years later, an activist carried red spray paint with her into the White House during a public tour and used it to deface a sculpture of Columbus; she was charged with felony destruction of government property.In 2007, a type of oil was found dripped over portions of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The Park Service considered the incident vandalism, but officials acknowledged that the oil might have been used by visitors in some type of ceremony. The case was never resolved.At the Lincoln Memorial on Friday, police were reportedly reviewing surveillance footage.
[PHOTOS: View images of the paint-splattered memorial.]
Authorities believe that the memorial was defaced about 1:30 a.m. Paint was splattered on the left side and base of the 19-foot-tall statue of Lincoln, who is depicted sitting in a thronelike chair, gazing toward the Washington Monument and the distant Capitol.Once the vandalism was discovered, Park Police closed the memorial to tourists for five hours.
[WATCH: Video of cleanup effort.]
The neoclassical memorial to the president who emancipated slaves and led the country through the Civil War was designed by Henry Bacon and modeled after an ancient Greek temple. Inscribed on the walls around the statue are Lincoln’s famous Gettysburg Address and second inaugural address.The memorial is surrounded by 36 fluted Doric columns, representing the 36 states at the time of Lincoln’s assassination, April 14, 1865.The memorial draws millions of visitors each year and has been the site of major moments in U.S. history.
Marian Anderson sang there on Easter in 1939 after her scheduled performance at nearby Constitution Hall was canceled because she was black.Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have A Dream” speech there on Aug. 28, 1963 — 50 years ago next month — during the famous March on Washington.The memorial has also been the site of concerts to celebrate presidential inaugurations, including that of Barack Obama in 2009 as the nation’s 44th president and the first African American to hold the office.
