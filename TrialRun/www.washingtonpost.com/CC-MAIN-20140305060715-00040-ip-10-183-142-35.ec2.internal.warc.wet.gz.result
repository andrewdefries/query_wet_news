NBC picks up shows starring Anne Heche, Matthew Perry; plus, a Ryan Murphy comedy and J.J. Abrams drama
By Lisa de Moraes
Anne Heche
(Michael Buckner - GETTY IMAGES)
New comedies in which Anne Heche thinks she’s channeling God, and Matthew Perry believes he can save the Holy Grail of broadcast TV, are among NBC’s early pickups for next season.
Although the broadcast networks aren’t set to unveil their plans for the 2012-13 TV season to advertisers until next week, NBC has been quietly staffing some new series it wants to launch out of the London Summer Olympics, whose closing ceremonies are scheduled for Aug. 12.
Among those series is Heche’s new show, “Save Me.” Heche, you’ll recall, was found in August 2000 — the day after her breakup with Ellen DeGeneres — wandering door to door in Fresno, Calif., talking about having been told to go meet a spaceship with the hit of ecstasy that was the price of boarding. That ultimately led to an interview with Barbara Walters, in which Heche explained that she had another personality named Celestia, who was from another planet and was the reincarnation of God, and that Celestia helped her cope with having been molested by her father. Meanwhile, NBC also has greenlit the comedy “Go On,” starring “Friends” alum Matthew Perry as a charismatic sportscaster who, trying to move on from loss, finds help from members of his group-therapy sessions. “Go On,” from “Friends” writer Scott Silveri, presumably is destined for NBC’s Thursday lineup — former home of the iconic Must See TV, but better known these days as the home of Self-Referential TV.
Also said to be staffing up is Ryan Murphy’s NBC comedy, “The New Normal,” about a gay couple starting a family with a surrogate. Also making NBC’s early pickup list: the new J.J. Abrams drama “The Revolution,” about people trying to reunite with family in the empty cities of a post-apocalyptic America — where no technology is available because all forms of energy have ceased to exist. NBC sometimes, but not always, uses the Olympic Games to launch its fall lineup early. Remember when it premiered the “Friends” spinoff “Joey” and the cop drama “Hawaii” right after the 2004 Summer Games? Four years later, NBC decided to wait instead for the official Premiere Week in mid-September to launch its new programs. This year, the pendulum seems to have swung back the other way.

Ex-Virginia executioner becomes opponent of death penalty
Video: As an executioner for the Commonwealth of Virginia, Jerry Givens executed 62 people. Now he’s lobbying and praying for the end of the death penalty in Virginia.
By Justin Jouvenal, E-mail the writer
Jerry Givens executed 62 people.
His routine and conviction never wavered. He’d shave the person’s head, lay his hand on the bald pate and ask for God’s forgiveness for the condemned. Then, he would strap the person into Virginia’s electric chair.

Former executioner opposes death penalty: Jerry Givens executed 62 people in Virginia’s electric chair. Since leaving his job he has become one of the state’s most visible — and unlikely — opponents to capital punishment. Database: Virginia executions
Find Virginia executions from 1982 to present by year, method of execution and by the victims’ names.
Givens was the state’s chief executioner for 17 years — at a time when the commonwealth put more people to death than any state besides Texas.“If you knew going out there that raping and killing someone had the consequence of the death penalty, then why are you going to do it?” Givens asked. “I considered it suicide.” As Virginia executed its 110th person in the modern era last month, Givens prayed for the man, but also for an end to the death penalty. Since leaving his job in 1999, Givens has become one of the state’s most visible — and unlikely — opponents of capital punishment.His evolution underscores that of Virginia itself and the nation. Although polls show that the majority of state residents still support the death penalty, Virginia has experienced a sea change on capital punishment in recent years that is part of a national trend. The state has had fewer death sentences over the past five years than any period since the 1970s. Robert Gleason, who was put to death Jan. 16, was the first execution in a year and a half. As recently as 1999, the state put 13 to death in a single year.Nationwide, the number of death sentences was at record lows in 2011 and 2012, down 75 percent since 1996, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Five states have outlawed capital punishment in the past five years, and Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) affirmed plans to push for a moratorium there. Gallup polls show support for capital punishment ebbing. Givens’s improbable journey to the death chamber and back did not come easily or quickly for the 60-year-old from Richmond. A searing murder spurred his interest in the work, but it was the innocent life he nearly took that led him to question the system. And he was changed for good when he found himself behind bars.His story helps explain how a state closely associated with the death penalty for decades has entered a new era.“From the 62 lives I took, I learned a lot,” Givens said.
The first execution
Friends and strangers regularly ask Givens the essential question: What is it like to take another man’s life? In answering, he vividly recalls his first execution, in 1984.That it involved one of America’s most notorious killers helped solidify Givens’s feelings then that the death penalty was just.Linwood Briley was one of three brothers in a gang responsible for one of the bloodiest murder sprees — and death row escapes — in state history. The day before Briley’s execution, Givens said, the death row team began a standard 24-hour vigil, monitoring Briley at the now-shuttered Virginia State Penitentiary in Richmond. The goal, as Givens put it, was to keep the condemned from killing himself before the state could.Nevertheless, the first execution took a toll. Givens said the most difficult part of that execution — or any other — was something he called the “transformation.”Givens worked as a prison guard “saving lives” most of the time, as he put it, but when he took on the role of executioner, he had to become a killer.Before Briley was put to death, he asked to be baptized, Givens said. The death team took him to the penitentiary’s chapel, and Givens prayed alongside the man whose life he would soon end.“We don’t know our day and time, but these guys do,” Givens said of death row inmates. “They can repent. This is the advantage they have.”The team moved Briley to the death chamber, and he was strapped in the electric chair. Givens took up a position along a wall outside, where the button was located. He could see Briley’s back through a small window.At these moments, Givens said, he would empty his mind to avoid fear, insecurities or regret. He was solely focused on the grisly mechanics of electrocution.“You are concentrating on the body itself,” he said. “With that much electricity, you are going to get burning and smoke. You want to make sure the current is right.”At 11 p.m. Oct. 12, 1984, Givens pushed the button. He saw Briley’s body spasm through the window. And then it was over. He had taken his first life.Inevitably, Givens said the emotion of an execution would come flooding back.“You are not going to feel happy,” Givens said. “You feel for the condemned man’s family and the victim’s family. You have two sets of families that are losing someone.”
The chamber and back
Givens grew up in the Creighton Court housing complex in Richmond, where he also graduated from high school in the early 1970s. By 1974, he had gotten a job at a Philip Morris plant and then lost it after fighting with a co-worker. He recalled someone telling him that he should apply for a job at the state penitentiary before he got sent there. Givens did just that.After two years as a prison guard, he said, a supervisor approached him about working on death row. He would not be paid extra, but he accepted the job. The deciding factor, he said, was an event that marked him early in life.When he was 14, Givens said, he was at a house party in Creighton Court. He spied a girl next to a window, and as he was trying to get up the confidence to ask her to dance, a gunman burst up a flight of stairs.The man was looking for someone at the party, but he fired randomly and killed the girl.Givens was furious. The incident left him with a firm conviction: Killers such as that shooter deserved to die. In the years ahead, Givens said, he would recall the girl’s shooting each time he had to prepare for an execution. It was a touchstone that helped him carry out the grim work of the death chamber.After Briley, the executions would come in quicker succession through the 1980s and 1990s. Givens executed Linwood Briley’s brother James in 1985. In 1993, it was Syvasky Poyner, who killed five women during an 11-day spree in southeast Virginia, and David Mark Pruett, who admitted to raping and killing his best friend’s wife. Ultimately, though, it was a man he didn’t execute who would make the biggest impression. Earl Washington Jr. was sentenced to death in 1984 in the rape and killing of a 19-year-old mother of three in Culpeper.Washington, who has an IQ of about 69, admitted to the killing, although many of his answers were inconsistent with the facts of the case. Just days before his scheduled execution in 1985, lawyers secured a stay based on doubts about his guilt.In 1993, DNA tests provided strong evidence that Washington was not the killer. Then-Gov. L. Douglas Wilder (D) commuted his sentence to life in prison. After testing with a more advanced forensic science, Washington was cleared and eventually granted an absolute pardon, making him the first person on Virginia’s death row to be exonerated by DNA evidence.It was a landmark moment locally and nationally. The case was among the first in a wave of exonerations based on post-conviction DNA testing. There have been 302 such cases across the nation, including 18 death row inmates, according to the Innocence Project.Experts and opponents of the death penalty say the exonerations have been a key factor in the recent decline in death sentences in Virginia and elsewhere. They say judges and juries have become more sophisticated about how the system can fail and therefore more leery of applying a penalty that cannot be reversed. The DNA testing “was a scientific process totally outside the system that said, ‘You’ve got the wrong guy,’ ” said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center and an opponent of the death penalty. “The fact that you had the entirely wrong person was a revelation to some people.”The man who would have been Washington’s executioner was one of them. Givens said the case shook his faith in the justice system. He came within days of putting an innocent man to death.“If I execute an innocent person, I’m no better than the people on death row,” Givens said.
From executioner to inmate
Despite his growing reservations, Givens continued to work as Virginia’s chief executioner through the late 1990s. He had risen to the rank of captain in the Department of Corrections, raised a family and become an assistant football coach at a Richmond area high school.But then it fell apart. Givens was charged with money laundering and lying to a federal grand jury about it in 1999. Prosecutors said Givens and an old friend from Creighton Court purchased a car together using proceeds Givens knew came from drug dealing. Givens was put on trial. “There’s a fine line between lawfulness and unlawfulness,” the U.S. attorney reportedly told the jury in the case. “There are a lot of good things about Jerry Givens. He is by no means the worst criminal any of us will ever meet, but he did cross the line.”Givens maintains his innocence, but he was convicted and forced to resign from the Department of Corrections. His distrust of the justice system was cemented.The prison guard became an inmate and spent four years behind bars. “This was God’s way of waking me up,” Givens said.His incarceration gave him time to think and deepened his Baptist faith. He said he read the Bible more often — the story of Jesus’s crucifixion held a lot for a man who had spent his adult life putting people to death.Givens said a pivotal moment came one day as he was walking around the prison track, where he often talked with God. He said God asked him a thorny question: Would Givens have executed His son if He were on death row? Givens said he could give only one reply: No, because Jesus was the son of God. He said he realized what he had done as executioner was not compatible with Jesus’s teachings of forgiveness. He realized that he could no longer support the death penalty. He said God told him to share his story. Evelyn Givens said she thought her brother’s change was possibly the result of guilt about what he had done and a desire to spare others from “walking in his shoes.”“He doesn’t want anyone else to feel what he felt,” she said.After he was released from prison in 2004, he found work as a truck driver. Jonathan Sheldon, a lawyer and former executive director of Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty (VADP), recalls hearing about Givens through a mutual acquaintance. They agreed to meet at a Burger King off Interstate 95 outside Richmond. The activist and the former chief executioner sat across from each other, talking about the death penalty. “It was quite a funny meeting,” Sheldon said.It also planted a seed that would grow in the coming years.Givens started attending VADP meetings and joined the board about 2009. He began giving speeches across the country about his experiences as chief executioner and his newfound opposition to the death penalty. The work hit a high point in 2010, when he testified at a state legislative hearing on a bill that would expand the death penalty to accomplices in murders. Givens’s emotional testimony about the impact of death row work helped defeat it.“The people who pass these bills, they don’t have to do it,” Givens said afterward. “The people who do the executions, they’re the ones who suffer through it.”Sen. J. Chapman “Chap” Peterson (D-Fairfax) said it was a key moment.“It was so dramatic, you could have heard a pin drop,” Peterson said. “No one knew who he was, and then he announced he had been the state’s chief executioner and gave an emotional and raw speech. It was something out of Dickens.”All the while, Virginia was changing as well. David Bruck, a law professor at Washington and Lee University’s law school and an opponent of capital punishment, said a number of other factors have contributed to the decline in use of the death penalty in Virginia.Like most states, Virginia has enacted sentences of life without parole, giving juries and prosecutors an alternative. The creation of the state’s capital public defender system has given those facing the death sentence better representation. Bruck also said the state’s prosecutors, who are elected in Virginia, feel less public pressure to pursue the death penalty than in years past because it has faded as a key political issue.“Our death sentencing rate is becoming similar to states like Colorado that have the death sentence on the books but hardly use it,” Bruck said.That’s good news to someone such as Givens. He said he has gained a measure of peace through his new calling. He wrote a book about his experiences, which was released last year.Nevertheless, he still wonders whether there were any innocents among the 37 people he executed via the electric chair and the 25 by lethal injection. The man who prayed for the forgiveness of each of the condemned said he may need it himself.“The only thing I can do is pray to God to forgive me if I did,” Givens said. “But I do know this — I will never do it again.”

Matthews shows improvement for 4-0 Dunbar, Jones thrives at new position for Good Counsel
Jonathan Newton/THE WASHINGTON POST - Dunbar quarterback Lamel Matthews, shown last season, has led the Crimson Tide to a 4-0 start.
By Roman Stubbs, Paul Tenorio and Steve Yanda, E-mail the writer
During this past offseason, the Dunbar coaching staff reviewed film of senior quarterback Lamel Matthews and came to two conclusions: He had trouble identifying defenses at the line of scrimmage, and his footwork was way too slow.
So far this fall, Matthews has demonstrated improvement on both fronts and, consequently, has led Dunbar to a 4-0 start. Matthews completed 13 of 19 passes for 219 yards and a touchdown during the Crimson Tide’s 35-7 win Friday at Jefferson (W.Va.). On the season, Matthews has completed 63.6 percent of his passes for 718 yards and seven touchdowns. He also has rushed for 295 yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries.
Video
Host B.J. Koubaroulis runs through the top plays from high school football games in D.C., Maryland and Virginia. Matthews has thrown two interceptions this season, and one of them came on a Hail Mary attempt.“So really, he’s playing mistake-free football,” Dunbar Coach Jerron Joe said. “He’s developing in my offense pretty well. He’s doing very well, actually.”Fortunately for Matthews – and for Joe, for that matter – the Crimson Tide coaching staff includes two assistants that are well-versed in quarterback skills. Stadford Brown, the team’s offensive coordinator, played quarterback at Dunbar and at Division II North Carolina Central, where he was named CIAA Offensive Player of the Year as a freshman in 2006. Todd Amis, Dunbar’s quarterbacks coach, tutored several successful quarterbacks, including Emmanuel Yeager, during his time as an assistant at Ballou.Joe said the overriding philosophy utilized by Brown and Amis is that a quarterback is only as good as his feet, not his arm. With that in mind, they put Matthews through a number of footwork drills this summer with the intention of solving what Joe described as Matthews’s “lazy” drop-backs in the pocket.Dunbar will need Matthews’s stretch of impressive play to continue Friday when the Crimson Tide plays at No. 5 DeMatha. A solid performance against the Stags (3-0) only would contribute to the haul of scholarship offers Joe said he anticipates will flow Matthews’s way once the player becomes an academic qualifier. Matthews is scheduled to take the SAT on Oct. 6.“Once [Matthews] takes the test and gets the scores, his offers should start piling in,” Joe said. “A lot of schools are showing interest. They’re just waiting for his scores to come in.”
Good Counsel makes adjustments
After an opening-week loss to Bishop Gorman (Nev.), coaches at top-ranked Good Counsel felt they needed some more aggressiveness near the line of scrimmage. Despite a number of Division I-bound linebackers, a spark was missing. “We needed some more attackers closer to the line of scrimmage that can play like a Dorian O’Daniel, Akeem Hebron, that Jelani Jenkins-type,” defensive line coach Kevin McFadden said.The decision was to move defensive back C.J. Jones to outside linebacker. The results have been tremendous. Jones leads or shares the lead for sacks (two), tackles for loss (five) and pass break ups (two) and is among the leaders in tackles (10) and assists (nine).“I was kind of upset that I was changing positions because it was a position I never played before,” Jones said. “I talked to the coaches and said I had a lot of things to learn. . . . After everything started and I learned some new stuff, I got better with what I was doing.”Jones said linebackers Marcel Ngachie and Darien Carr helped him in his transition, and it didn’t take long for Jones to see the payoff. Against Gilman on Aug. 31, the plays started to come to him, he said.“I was nervous before,” Jones said. “I didn’t know how I was going to play. As the game started going I started making plays and I was like, ‘Hey, I started getting used to this position.’”The Falcons especially benefited last week with O’Daniel out resting some bumps and bruises. And with a tough Washington Catholic Athletic Conference slate ahead — beginning with a Saturday game at No. 19 Gonzaga (3-1) — Jones figures to be a major factor for the Falcons moving forward.“He didn’t bicker, didn’t talk about the program, didn’t start quitting,” McFadden said. “He just took his [orders], came back out with a plan of attack and he’s rolling, man. It shows how you can overcome adversity.”
St. Stephen’s/St. Agnes turns to yoga
After going 1-8 in his first season as head coach at St. Stephens/St. Agnes, Bernard Joseph designed a different weekly schedule for his program heading into the 2012 season. Teams from around the region, he said, were viewing the Saints as an easy win a year ago, and to change that stigma, he needed his players to buy into a new system that promised new results. So on Thursday afternoons, while other schools are typically running walk-through practices in preparation for weekend games, the Saints are indoors, in a room on campus taking an hour-long yoga session. No football, just meditation and relaxation, together. And Joseph believes it has been a major factor in the Saints’ surprising 3-0 start, not only cutting down on the cramping and injuries that snuck up on St. Stephen’s/St. Agnes a year ago, but also changing the way his program carries itself mentally on game day. “I think its helped. We’re not cramping up as much, the kids are getting a little more flexible...I think its great for the school community,” Joseph said.Joseph has had no problems persuading his players to buy into the yoga classes, and much of that is due to Darius Manora, who started yoga at the school a year ago and has led by example. Manora’s play on the field has done plenty of talking as well. In Saturday’s 57-27 win over Bishop Ireton, the senior running back had 255 yards rushing and four touchdowns in what Joseph calls “one of the single most outstanding performances by a high school player I’ve ever seen.” Manora had touchdown runs of 60, 57, 68 and 26, and he also recorded an 80-yard interception return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. It was Manora’s second pick of the day, and his fourth of the season from his defensive back position. “It’s been a long way coming, getting these guys the confidence over the past two years,” said Manora, a 4.2 GPA student who is drawing interest from all the Ivy League schools and the Naval Academy, among others. “I had a great game thanks to my guys up front, the freshmen lineman.”The Saints are starting four freshman on the line - which could be the team’s greatest liability and its greatest asset. Joseph knows the front will be challenged in the weeks to come as the competition stiffens - the Saints play defending MAC champion Potomac School next week - but the atmosphere has changed this fall at St. Stephen’s/St. Agnes, and the future is bright. “I’m very optimistic about the future. It’s funny, because we’re building it with lineman. Normally, that’s the toughest part to build on,” Joseph said.“What I don't think, is that people can line up against us and feel like they have a victory because they’re playing St. Stephens.”
Around the IAC
Bullis (3-0) continued to display its offensive prowess in Saturday’s 34-13 win over St. Mary’s-Annapolis, as quarterback Danny Copeland threw for 252 yards and three touchdowns, while sophomore running back Devonte Williams added 96 yards and a score on 11 carries. Senior wide receiver Nick Fields recorded five catches for 92 yards and a 55-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. . . .
Landon dropped its first game of the season, 24-14 to Baltimore’s Mount St. Joseph. Landon’s Philip Pena, who led the team in both passing (110 yards) and rushing (61 yards), scored the games first touchdown, but Mount St. Joseph’s reeled off 24 unanswered points to take control. Landon starting running back Myles Allen did not play for the second consecutive game due to injury...St. Albans is in the win column for the first time in 2012 after beating Riverdale Baptist 34-8. The Bulldogs scored in all three phases, which included a 46-yard interception return for a touchdown by defensive back Chris Fraser in the first quarter Saturday. St. Albans quarterback Mike McCurdy threw for 235 yards and two touchdowns on just seven completions in the win. . . .
Episcopal won its season opener Saturday, thanks in large part to a defensive effort that kept Flint Hill starting quarterback Stevie Peterson in check. After throwing for 266 yards a week ago against Paul VI Catholic, Peterson was just 7 for 18 for 73 yards and threw an interception. Around the MAC
While Flint Hill went down in nonconference action, so did defending MAC champ Potomac School, which lost, 49-13, to Paul VI Catholic. Potomac School Coach Pat Duffy said following the loss that tackling is a major issue for his team early in the season - the Panthers allowed 310 yards rushing on Saturday, which Duffy said was a by-product of missed tackles and poor angles on defense...
Maret (3-0) continued its hot start with with a 42-7 win over Randolph Macon on Saturday. Defensive end and tight end Tre Bowens’s stock is only going to continue to rise, according to Maret Coach Mike Engleberg, after Bowens posted three sacks and three more tackles for loss on Saturday. He also caught three passes for 74 yards, including a 54-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Bowens has nine sacks and two touchdown catches this season... Sidwell Friends (2-0) earned a 31-21 win over Victory Christian on Saturday. Senior receiver Diamente Holloway caught five passes for 86 yards, including three touchdowns, and Sidwell overcame a 21-0 second quarter deficit in the win.

Portugal’s birthrate plummeting, a sign of more economic trouble ahead
View Photo Gallery — Portugal’s baby bust: Confronted with massive unemployment, Europe is again experiencing a steep decline in birthrates. At the center of this is Portugal, where the recent fall in births — to 89,841 in 2012, a 14 percent drop since 2008 — has been so acute that the government is moving to close a slew of maternity wards nationwide. By Anthony Faiola, E-mail the writer
LISBON — For an enterprise in the business of welcoming life, the birthing ward in Portugal’s largest maternity hospital is eerily quiet. On a recent morning, not a single expectant father nervously paced the orange laminated floors. Unhurried nurses passed rows of darkened rooms with empty beds, busying themselves with paperwork and a mere three women in labor.
Elsewhere in the hospital, signs of Europe’s crisis within a crisis are everywhere. Serving a country that was battling a low birthrate even before the region’s economy fell off a cliff, Alfredo da Costa Maternity Hospital delivered about 7,000 babies a year until recently. But with economic uncertainty causing young couples to rethink family plans or leave these shores for other countries, the number of births crashed last year to 4,500, leading the hospital to mothball an entire wing and slash 20 percent of the staff.

Bombings, clashes in Iraq kill at least 42
Associated Press No one claimed responsibility for the string of bombings, mostly from parked car bombs and one explosive planted in an outdoor market. The recent decline in births across Portugal — to 89,841 babies in 2012, a 14 percent drop since 2008 — has been so acute that the national government is moving to close a slew of maternity wards nationwide. In an increasingly childless country, 239 schools are shutting down this year and sales of products such as baby diapers and children’s shampoos are plummeting.At the same time, in the fast-graying interior, gas stations and motels are being converted into nursing homes even as stores selling toys and baby clothes close their doors. Here in Lisbon, Alfredo da Costa — founded in 1932 when this once-great maritime nation still commanded a global empire — is on the chopping block, set for closure this year.“We used to hear the best kind of cries in these halls, of babies,” said Teresa Tome, Alfredo da Costa’s head pediatrician, as she strode through the quiet birthing ward. She later added: “The recent decrease in births has been dramatic. This is because of the economic crisis, all the unemployment, all the uncertainty about the future. It is making a bad problem for the country worse.”
Portugal is at the forefront of Europe’s latest baby bust, one that is shortening the fuse on a time bomb of social costs in some of the world’s most rapidly aging societies.As in many corners of the industrialized world, Europe has faced a gradual decline in birthrates since the 1960s. But in a number of the region’s hardest-hit countries, a modest rebound during the 2000s — when European governments welcomed immigrants and rolled out cash benefits for young couples starting families — has now gone into reverse.Birthrates are falling again in several nations that are confronting massive unemployment, including Portugal, Spain, Greece, Ireland and Cyprus. The baby shortage, economists say, is set to pile on the woe for a swath of the continent that may already be facing a decade or more of economic fallout from the debt crisis that started in 2009.
A reckoning accelerates
By 2030, the retired population in Portugal, for instance, is expected to surge by 27.4 percent, with those older than 65 predicted to make up nearly one in every four residents. With fewer future workers and taxpayers being born, however, the Portuguese are confronting what could be an accelerated fiscal reckoning to provide for their aging population. Portugal is ahead of other nations in Europe in planning for those explosive costs. But some government officials here concede that far deeper cuts — as well as a push toward a united social security system within the European Union — may be needed to cope with what is turning out to be a worse-than-expected demographic crisis.The diminishing number of young Portuguese could lead to a vacuum of dynamism and innovation in the years ahead, signaling what could be a long-term decline in the fortunes of nations in a region harboring some of the United States’ largest trading partners and closest political allies.The U.S. birthrate has also come down sharply since the 1960s. But the United States is projected to have a generous influx of immigrants in the years ahead while also maintaining a more robust birthrate than those European nations hit the hardest.With deaths regularly outpacing births and both native-born Portuguese and immigrants from former colonies such as Brazil and Angola departing the country in large numbers, the population is falling. Some hold out hope that the birthrate will bounce back if and when the economy improves and young Portuguese feel more secure about their future.But experts predict that the population loss ahead could be beyond even the worst-case predictions of nearly 1 million inhabitants fewer — or almost 10 percent of the current population of 10.56 million — by 2030. That has many here bemoaning the “disappearance” of a nation and asking: Who will be left to support a dying country of old men and women?“This is one of the biggest problems we face as a nation,” said José Tavares, a political economics professor at the Nova School of Business and Economics in Lisbon. “If we don’t find a way to fix this, we will be facing a disaster.”
Fearing for the future
Along the narrow, hilly streets of the inland municipality of Vila Velha de Rodao, Mafalda Diogo Sabino’s fame is already legendary. The local newspaper heralded her arrival in September with a half-page spread and a goody basket of oils and lotions delivered to her door. Every day since, seemingly everyone has wanted a piece of the fickle little celebrity, with her adoring fans shadowing her in the hopes of pinching an unsuspecting cheek or catching a glimpse of her now-fabled smile.In this graying corner of the Iberian Peninsula, the 9-month-old’s claim to fame is merely being born.Communities such as this one, a conglomeration of villages with a population of 3,600 — nearly half what it was in the 1970s — have become ghosts of Portugal’s future. Mafalda’s mother, Susana Diogo, 27, had to travel two hours by car in the summer heat to give birth at the nearest hospital able to handle an expectant mother with diabetes. Diogo and her husband, Mario Sabino, 32, worry about their daughter’s future in a town with only three other newborns and just one school.“I wonder what Portugal will look like for both her and us by the time she gets older,” said Diogo, who lost her job when a nearby call center closed after she became pregnant.Here, care for the elderly is the largest single public expenditure. Recent national cuts have reduced the number of seniors the town is able to help in its main adult day-care facility.Local officials have sought to lure back young people, offering cash subsidies for new home buyers in an attempt to stem years of losses of working-age residents to inland cities and more prosperous countries. The town is providing preschool for next to nothing, using a corner of a nursing home for the children.Seniors living at the home, such as Maria Jesus Rodrigues, 87, relish the contact with children.“We used to have children everywhere when I was young. We never thought about the economic side; we just had them,” Rodrigues said. “But there are not so many now. Young people today are thinking more about how they will pay for children with so few jobs. I guess I understand.”A few minutes later, Rodrigues, who moved to the home from her nearby village, where the youngest resident is 57, burst into a local folk song.“I have to sing now,” she crooned, “because when I die, there will be no one left to sing for me.”
