Britney Spears is leaving ‘X Factor,’ Fox’s singing competition, source says
By Lisa de Moraes, E-mail the writer
PASADENA, Calif. — Britney Spears will not stick around to mentor X-testants on the third season of the Fox singing competition “The X Factor,” according to an industry source who has knowledge of the situation.
No surprise here. More from Lisa de Moraes
Pulitzer Prize winner, Peabody recipient, Medal of Freedom honoree -- Lisa de Moraes is none of these, but she is an authority on the bad direction, over-acting, and muddled plot lines being played out in the TV industry's executive suites. Archive
Live Q&As
@WaPoTeamTV
(Jason Merritt/GETTY IMAGES) - Britney Spears joined “The X Factor” for its second season. The pop star was being paid $15 mill-ish to play a mentor on the show. That would have been a small price to pay had she goosed the ratings of “X Factor,” which in its first season achieved only half the crowd that creator Simon Cowell had promised.But Brit failed to deliver, the ratings tumbled further in the second season and the show got clobbered by NBC’s singing-competition series, “The Voice.” A Fox rep decline to comment on Spears’s status at the network.Word of Spears’s reported exit surfaced less than 48 hours after Fox Entertainment Chairman Kevin Reilly told TV critics that Spears did a good job on the show and that the network was on board with bringing her back for the third season. “I think Britney did a really good job,” he said at Winter TV Press Tour 2013. “People remain fascinated with her and always will be. She tucked in really nicely on that bench.”Those remarks left at least one TV columnist wondering what show Reilly had been watching. Despite her fame and history of bizarro behavior, Britbrit’s time on “X” was most notable for her apparent boredom and limited vocabulary — “awesome” and one or two other words. That was enormously disappointing to viewers, who’d naturally hoped to see the pop star engage in more of her famed erratic behavior.In exiting, Bribrit would be joining L.A. Reid, who has also bailed on the third season. He said that he has to get back to his other career: finding music talent in the real world.This would be the second time that “X” has replaced two mentors on the show. At the end of the first season, Cowell dumped Paula Abdul and Nicole Scherzinger, as well as host Steve Jones, citing the disappointing ratings — numbers that he’d now be happy to get.The show this season also added mentor Demi Lovato and co-hosts: Veteran Mario Lopez was joined by Khloe Kardashian, who every week read every line off cue cards as if she were taking the eye test at the DMV.
From Fuhrer to fox trots
TV critics took a break Thursday from the We Welcome a Conversation About TV’s Role in Rampant Real-Life Gun Violence Press Tour to mull whether they should be knicker-knotted about the Hitler joke made by this year’s Oscars host, Seth MacFarlane, at that morning’s Academy Awards nominations unveiling.“Look, I’m a huge Seth fan. What he brings first is a sense of joy. He wants to be there,” ABC programming chief Paul Lee told the critics when asked about the joke.“He brings a lot of energy to it. . . . He’s coming to the Oscars with a great sense of respect but brings a really contemporary feel,” said Lee, boldly ignoring the aged Hitler gag.“I’m feeling good about it and particularly about him — I think we’ll see a very entertaining Oscars, and Seth is right at the heart of that. I’m really bullish about that.”Hours earlier, MacFarlane and Emma Stone read the names of nominees in the best foreign film derby, after which MacFarlane said that one of the flicks was co-produced by Austria and Germany and that the last time those two countries co-produced something, it was Hitler.Eventually, though, critics asked Lee the TV-and-violence question. But because ABC is the only major broadcast network without a serial killer in its prime-time lineup, their hearts weren’t really in it. Lee called recent events — including last month’s killings of 20 elementary schoolchildren and several adults in Connecticut and the slayings of a dozen moviegoers last summer at a Colorado theater — “awful” and “heartbreaking.” Lee then launched into the traditional network suit line: “Certainly we welcome the conversation,” blah, blah, blah.Then he began to discuss ABC’s “stringent standards,” which he claimed were more stringent than those of its competitors, adding: “We think about it and talk about it all the time.”“Look, we’re storytellers,” he said, but storytellers with “integrity” and a “moral compass” who tolerate “no gratuitous violence.” Speaking of storytellers with integrity, the “Dancing With the Stars” all-stars edition was a bust in the fall because, Lee said, it turns out people like watching bad overweight celebrity dancers shed pounds and learn their left foot from their right for the first time — instead of seeing previous-season winners and crowd faves re-competing.The all-star edition was concocted to keep the show as competitive as possible when it went head-to-head with “The Voice” for the first time in the fall. “Dancing” scored some record-low numbers for the franchise — down 20 percent year to year among viewers and 30 percent among young viewers.The fall’s ratings fiasco notwithstanding, Lee said that the network is still committed to running a spring edition and two rounds each season.“There’s a lot of life left in it,” he insisted.Airing on two nights in the fall, the “Dancing” all-star edition contributed more than its share to ABC’s third-place finish so far this season. Lee said he was disappointed that none of his new series became hits last fall. The network has scrubbed two of its high-profile freshman drama series: “Last Resort” and “666 Park Avenue.” Shows that succeed on ABC are “smart with heart,” the executive said. That’s Lee-speak for: “can be male-skewing, but had better be very relatable to ABC’s mostly female audience.”“If we ever have a [series with a] ‘Do Not Enter’ sign for women, that’s not going to work for us,” Lee said, when asked why these freshman shows had failed.Yet ABC has ordered a pilot from Joss Whedon for a drama called “S.H.I.E.L.D,” based on Marvel’s “The Avengers.” “I don’t want to jinx it, but we’re very excited about it,” said Lee, calling it “very Joss” and, yes, “smart with heart.” To read more from Winter TV Press Tour 2013, go to washingtonpost.com/tvblog.

Georgetown freshman Jabril Trawick ‘is not going to get pushed around’
Ann Heisenfelt/Associated Press - “He’s never going to give anything easy,” college basketball analyst Jon Rothstein said of Georgetown freshman Jabril Trawick. “He’s always about one thing: toughness. He has a chip on his shoulder.”
By Tarik El-Bashir, E-mail the writer
The contributions Georgetown reserve Jabril Trawick makes don’t necessarily show up in the box score. But his gritty defense, hustle plays and hard fouls are necessary to win, particularly in the rugged Big East.
Trawick, a versatile freshman guard, does all of that. He’s also one reason the youthful Hoyas (12-1, 2-0) have continued to surprise, rising to No. 9 ahead of Wednesday’s showdown with Darius Johnson-Odom and No. 20 Marquette (12-2, 1-0) at Verizon Center.
“He brings a level of competitiveness that we needed,” Coach John Thompson III said Tuesday of Trawick. “Physically, as much as any freshman, he’s not going to get pushed around because he’s physically ready to play.”Although Trawick’s numbers — four points, 1.7 rebounds and 14.2 minutes per game — don’t sound all that imposing, glimpses of a much higher ceiling have become apparent, particularly in clutch moments. His breakout performance, after all, came in Georgetown’s biggest win of the season — last week’s 71-68 road victory at then-No. 4 Louisville.Trawick scored all nine of his points in the first half to help the Hoyas stay within striking distance of the Cardinals. His season-high point total, however, told only half the story. He also used his 6-foot-5, 205-pound frame to play tough, physical defense on Louisville’s guards.And also send a message.With about seven minutes remaining and the Hoyas clinging to a six-point lead, Trawick hammered Cardinals leading scorer Kyle Kuric as he drove the lane, looking for a potentially crowd-igniting dunk. Trawick, though, wasn’t having it.“I seen him coming through the lane,” he said. “It looked like he was going to try and dunk it. I wasn’t trying to be on ‘Top 10 Plays’ or anything like that. If he could have dunked on me, that could have given his team momentum.”
Jon Rothstein, a college basketball analyst for CBS Sports Network, described Trawick as a player who “does everything that affects winning” and, thus, was not surprised by the foul that left Kuric on his back.“He’s never going to give anything easy,” added Rothstein, who is familiar with Trawick from observing the AAU circuit. “He’s always about one thing: toughness. He has a chip on his shoulder.”Trawick said that chip comes from growing up in West Philadelphia and, in particular, the the court where he spent much of his youth, “The Pit.” When he wasn’t playing organized basketball, he said he was on that well-known blacktop, often competing against older, stronger players.“I could come out of my house, and the court was five, 10 steps to the left,” he said. “Everybody came to play there. Growing up in Philly, it’s a tough place to play, a tough place to grow up. That’s all I knew.”Senior captain Jason Clark acknowledged the edge Trawick brings to the floor is something the Hoyas lacked in past seasons.“I went over and told him that was a great foul,” Clark said, referring to Trawick’s foul on Kuric. “This is the Big East. You can’t be soft in the Big East. You have to let people know that scoring isn’t going to be easy.”Clark also praised Trawick’s basketball IQ.“Even when he’s not in the game, he pays attention,” Clark said. “Against Louisville, Jabril noticed that when we cut hard, it opened up a guy in the corner. The next two plays, after someone made a cut, Henry [Sims] made a pass to the corner and the guy was wide open.”On Wednesday, the Hoyas will need Trawick’s tenacity off the bench against a Marquette team that’s ranked 25th nationally in points per game (78.6) and 11th in assists (17.4). The up-tempo Golden Eagles are led by Johnson-Odom (17.9 points per game) and Jae Crowder (16.6).While defense is what Trawick’s best known for these days, Thompson expects his dribble-drive skills and emerging jump shot to help him make an impact at both ends as he matures.“He brings a lot to the table,” Thompson said. “In Louisville, his offense kept us in the game in the first half. So I don’t think he’s one that needs to be put into that box of, ‘Oh, he’s a tough, energy guy.’ ”“But,” Thompson added with a chuckle, “he does do those things.”
