The Circuit: Microsoft fined by the E.U.
By Hayley Tsukayama
Microsoft fined by the European Union: Microsoft was fined over $730 million for breaking the terms of an earlier antitrust agreement to offer Windows users a choice for their Internet browser, the Associated Press reported.
The case stems from Microsoft’s antitrust settlement with regulators over a decade ago, and is the first time that the European Commission has fined a company for not adhering to terms of a deal.
Microsoft has apologized for failing to provide browser choices to its users and said that it has taken steps to avoid similar problems in the future, the report said.
Sen. Cornyn asks about Aaron Swartz: Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tx.) asked Attorney General Eric Holder whether Holder believed there had been prosecutorial overreach or misconduct in the Department of Justice’s handling of the case against Aaron Swartz. Swartz, an early leader at Reddit and well-known Internet activist, was found dead in his apartment in January, of an apparent suicide.
Holder said he did not believe that there had been any overreach or misconduct in the case, and said that the prosecutors in the case never intended for Swartz to service more than a six-month sentence.
Growing support for cellphone unlocking: Several lawmakers are lending their support to the idea of allowing consumers to unlock their cellphones to move more easily between carriers following a White House statement earlier this week announcing support for the measure.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Tuesday that she would prepare legislation to allow consumers to unlock their phones; on Wednesday, Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) made a similar pledge.
University presidents support immigration reform:
The Hill reports that university presidents from Arizona State University, Cornell University and Miami Dade College sent an open letter to over 1,000 university officials asking their colleagues to support immigration reforms to allow students who earn degrees in science, mathematics, engineering and math fields to stay in the United States after graduation.
The letter, according to a version of the letter posted by The Hill, said that, too often, their “ability to educate and our ability to innovate are frustrated by US immigration laws.”

For Mitt Romney, it’s the economy or bust
Posted by Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake
at 06:30 AM ET, 06/22/2012
TheWashingtonPost
Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney’s path to victory over President Obama this fall is remarkably simple: Turn the election in a straight referendum on the incumbent’s handling of the economy.While that sentiment has been kicking around the political world for months, new polling numbers from the Pew Research Center paint that electoral reality for Romney (and Obama) in stark relief.
On eight different character traits, Obama leads Romney by margins as large as 31 points (“connects with ordinary Americans”) to two points (“can get things done”).Obama has double-digit leads over Romney on six of the eight character traits, including “willing to take an unpopular stand” (+19), “honest and truthful” (+14) and “good judgment in a crisis” (+13). But, on the question of which candidate would do the best job of “improving economic conditions,” 49 percent of people choose Romney, while 41 percent opt for Obama.What do those numbers tell us? That to win in November, Romney must avoid allowing the race to descend into a personality battle of any sort; Obama beats him if that happens. Romney has to keep voters’ attention almost entirely focused on the president and what he has done in his first four years in office on the economy.The Pew numbers suggest that Romney’s victory is almost entirely predicated on voters being motivated by a single question as they cast their ballots: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?”The good news for Romney is that every poll we have seen for months suggests voters are focused like a laser on the economy. In the Pew survey, 35 percent said that jobs was the most important issue deciding their vote, while 23 percent named the budget deficit. Health care finished third at 19 percent.History is also with Romney, as no president in the post-World War II era has been re-elected with an unemployment rate even close to 8.2 percent, which is where the number stood in the May jobs report.Still, forcing a straight referendum is no easy task, as the Obama team is doing — and will continue to do — everything they can to draw attention to Romney’s party, his record at Bain Capital and his four years as governor of Massachusetts.
Bain companies shipped jobs overseas: The Post’s Tom Hamburger has a story that will be talked about plenty on Friday, revealing that during Romney’s time at Bain, the company invested in firms that relocated jobs overseas to countries like China and India.The report says that Bain actually owned companies that pioneered the practice, which could pose problems for Romney going forward.On the campaign trail, Romney has lamented outsourcing.“They’ve been able to put American businesses out of business and kill American jobs,” he told workers at a Toledo fence factory in February. “If I’m president of the United States, that’s going to end.”The story serves as a reminder that, even as the Bain attack hasn’t gone smoothly for Obama’s campaign, there’s always more to mine. And the jury is still out on Bain’s impact on Romney’s candidacy.
GOP more engaged, but Dems like their candidate: Some telling numbers from a new poll from the Pew Research Center.The newest Pew poll shows Republican voters are more engaged than Democrats and paying closer attention to the election, but Democrats like their candidate much better.While Republicans have an eight-point edge in the number of them who are following election news closely and a seven-point edge on two other enthusiasm measures, Democrats have an eight-point edge when it comes to being satisfied with their candidate.Sixty-eight percent of Democrats said they were fairly or very satisfied with their candidate, while just 60 percent of Republicans said the same.But the GOP’s advantages are the highest they have been in the last six presidential elections on two measures: following the news closely and saying that it really matters who wins. The GOP also led on those measures when they won in 2000 and 2004.Those same years, though, the GOP was more excited about its candidate. So we’re in uncharted territory here.
Fixbits:
Yet another poll in Michigan shows the race neck and neck. Independent pollster Steve Mitchell shows Obama at 47 percent and Romney at 46.The conservative group Right Change parodies the Dos Equis commercials by labeling Obama “The Most Arrogant Man in the World.”Obama’s latest ad gets four Pinnochios from the Post’s great fact checker, Glenn Kessler.Special election-winning Rep. Ron Barber (D-Ariz.) resurrects former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords’s (D-Ariz.) “Congress on Your Corner” town halls — the same event at which both of them were shot in January 2011.Rep. Tammy Baldwin’s (D-Wis.) first Senate ad focuses on China.The Montana Republican Party is on the air for Rep. Denny Rehberg (R-Mont.) in that state’s Senate race.Wisconsin Senate candidate Eric Hovde (R) raises money off his controversial comment about the media writing too many “sob stories” about those affected by the economic hard times.Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst (R) lays out his term-limits plan in the state’s open Senate race.Sen. Jim DeMint’s (R-S.C.) Senate Conservatives Fund has dropped its first $25,000 on Dewhurst’s primary runoff opponent, Ted Cruz.Even Democratic polling shows former senator Bob Kerrey (D) down double digits to state Sen. Deb Fischer (R) in the Nebraska Senate race.

SEC enforcement chief stepping down
JONATHAN BACHMAN/REUTERS - SEC Enforcement Division Director Robert Khuzami speaks at a news conference to announce new criminal charges and a settlement in the case against British oil company BP Plc for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, in New Orleans on Nov. 15, 2012. BP Plc will pay $4.5 billion in penalties and plead guilty to felony miscomisconduct in the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
By Dina ElBoghdady, E-mail the writer
Robert S. Khuzami, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement division for the past four years, announced Wednesday that he plans to leave the agency in two weeks.
A former federal prosecutor, Khuzami is largely credited with restoring the reputation of a plodding unit that was ridiculed for its failure to detect Bernard Madoff’s massive Ponzi scheme or aggressively pursue financial misconduct on Wall Street.

Cecilia Kang Deal pulls user data into Facebook’s advertising business, groups say.
After joining the agency in February 2009, Khuzami revamped the division into a more nimble team that has brought a record number of cases. An early one, which led to a $550 million settlement with Goldman Sachs in 2010, put the agency back on the enforcement map.The SEC did not comment on who will succeed Khuzami. But the next pick is sure to face many of the same pressures he did, including demands to hold the barons of Wall Street — and not just their institutions — accountable for misdeeds tied to the financial crisis. The successor will be pressed to do so despite severe budgetary constraints, a hurdle that Khuzami alluded to in a farewell message to the hundreds of lawyers he oversees. “We specialize in fighting above our weight class — each of you does that every time you go into a conference room facing an army of defense counsel, with seemingly unlimited budgets and the latest technology,” Khuzami wrote in an e-mail.Khuzami does not leave free of criticism. Members of Congress, investor advocacy groups and SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar, a Democrat, have blasted some of the settlements his division reached with Wall Street as nothing more than slaps on the wrist.Khuzami’s departure has been rumored since Mary L. Schapiro stepped down as SEC chairman last month. His name was briefly floated as her possible successor, although at the time several people suggested he would probably prefer to return to the private sector. Before joining the SEC, Khuzami was a top lawyer at Deutsche Bank. In an interview Wednesday, Khuzami said that he has not started looking for a new job but that when he does, there’s a “decent chance” it will be in the more lucrative private sector, in part because he’s “feeling the pressure to provide for my family.”
The Rochester, N.Y., native is the son of two professional ballroom dancers. His sister is a muralist and his brother is a drummer for Greek and Middle Eastern bands. He started his government career as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan in 1990 after graduating from Boston University School of Law and spending a few years in private practice.At the U.S. attorney’s office, Khuzami made his mark helping prosecute the infamous “blind sheik,” Omar Abdel Rahman, for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. During his 11-year career there, he went on to lead the prominent white-collar crime unit and oversaw the investigation of complex securities cases.Khuzami’s experience as a prosecutor is what ultimately led Schapiro to cold-call him soon after she was nominated to lead the SEC in January 2009.“I was looking for an enforcement director, and I called a lot of people in the enforcement world, academia and others,” Schapiro said in an interview Wednesday. “His name just kept coming up over and over.”Khuzami was at Deutsche Bank at the time, and Schapiro expected him to quickly dismiss the idea of another government job. “But he was interested immediately,” she said. Once inside the agency, Khuzami swiftly flattened the management ranks and reorganized the division into specialized units focused on five high-priority areas, such as market abuse in a model he borrowed from his days in the U.S. attorney’s office. “People did not like us when we got there,” said Lorin Reisner, who served as Khuzami’s deputy for more than two years and worked with him in the U.S. attorney’s office. “We were two former prosecutors from New York who had never worked for the SEC. There was a lot of skepticism.” Khuzami also put in place one program that financially rewards whistleblowers and anotherthat allows his unit to strike non-prosecution or deferred-prosecution deals with cooperative witnesses, a tool that has helped the agency crack cases. The approach provided record results for the agency, including an all-time high of 735 enforcement actions in 2011 and 734 last year, as well as a historic number of insider-trading investigations in the past three years.“Rob’s leadership and bold ideas transformed and reinvigorated the enforcement program,” SEC Chairman Elisse B. Walter said in a statement. Even one of the SEC’s harshest critics, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, had kind words for the departing Khuzami. In 2011, Rakoff rejected a $285 million settlement that the SEC had negotiated with Citibank, in part because the agency did not exact an acknowledgment of wrongdoing from the company. But Rakoff put that aside on Wednesday.“Overall, I think he has done a terrific job,” Rakoff said in a statement. “Most important, he has restored a sense of pride and purpose to the S.E.C. enforcement division, and we are all the better for it.”

(Sarah L. Voisin/ THE WASHINGTON POST ) - The Japanese cabbage pancake called okonomiyaki, topped with flavorful sauces and mayonnaise, is best eaten hot off the griddle.
CAPTION
By David Hagedorn, E-mail the writer
When chef Alison Swope was developing an Asian-based menu for the Alexandria location of Teaism last year, she searched the Internet for a Japanese dish that would utilize the kitchen’s large griddle. Okonomiyaki, a wildly popular street food sometimes referred to as “Japanese pizza,” popped up over and over.
Okonomiyaki, which means “as you like it, grilled,” are robust cabbage pancakes made with add-ins such as shrimp, squid, vegetables, pork belly or sausage. A thin batter of wheat flour, bonito-kelp broth (dashi) and eggs binds the lot, which then gets generously doused with okonomi sauce (think Worcestershire, soy sauce and ketchup mixed together) and sweetly tart Kewpie brand mayonnaise, which tastes a bit like Miracle Whip. Bonito flakes, chopped scallions and aonori (dried seafood flakes, the chopped parsley of Japanese cooking) grace the pancake as garnishes.

Recipes from seven years of Super Bowl Smackdowns
The time-honored Food section tradition of recipe face-offs started with a battle over chili and has led to several game-day-worthy dishes.
Now, the idea of cabbage pancakes might not seem rhapsodic. But if you were to ask Americans who have lived in Japan or Japanese people who live here about okonomiyaki, their eyes would light up. They would ask you where to find them.When Swope first served me one last year, it looked a right mess, with thin shavings of bonito dancing to and fro on top. But as I dived in, I found myself unable to stop eating it.“Pizza” is a bit of a stretch. Crisped crepe is closer to reality.“A lot of the places that serve okonomiyaki in Japan have tables with griddles in the center of them, so you make them right there,” Swope says. “They bring out the components, and you make your own okonomiyaki and share them with your friends.”Swope serves hers out of Teaism’s kitchen. The chef likes to put her own twist on things, so what really appeals to her is that what gets added to the master cabbage batter or used for toppings on finished pancakes is a matter of personal preference. So adorning a vegetarian version with sauteed spinach and portabello mushrooms is just fine, as is serving a breakfast order topped with turkey bacon and fried eggs.Thanks to chefs like Swope, okonomiyaki may be crossing over into the culinary mainstream beyond the few Japanese or Asian-fusion restaurants in Falls Church or Annandale where I managed to track them down, such as Maneki Neko, Ara Fusion Restaurant and Honey Pig Izakaya.At Artifact Coffee, Spike Gjerde’s new cafe in Baltimore, chef Ben Lambert makes a version; he got hooked on them when he was 18 and living in the East Village in Manhattan. Also in Baltimore, at Pabu in the Four Seasons Hotel, chef Jonah Kim serves okonomiyaki made with Maryland blue crab, pork belly and a sunny-side-up egg.In Washington, trendsetter Katsuya Fukushima is toying with the idea of putting okonomiyaki on the menu of his recently opened Penn Quarter ramen bar, Daikaya, once the upstairs izakaya opens. Kaz Okochi is working out the logistics to serve them at Kaz Sushi Bistro, perhaps in individual iron skillets.Swope and Okochi each showed me how they make okonomiyaki. Swope threw together two handfuls of chopped cabbage (packaged coleslaw mix, actually) and half-cups or so of chopped scallions and crunchy tempura bits (tenkasu) that in Japan might be leftovers scooped out of the fryer.“The Japanese don’t like to waste anything,” Swope says.She added barely a third of a cup of batter to the cabbage, mixed it together and piled it onto a very hot griddle greased with clarified butter. She pressed the mix into a circle, neatening the edges with the side of a spatula. A few minutes on each side, and the okonomiyaki was done, nicely crisped on the outside.Swope makes her own tempura bits and dashi, even though packaged tenkasu and instant dashi are readily available. When I asked Okochi whether he uses instant dashi, he feigned astonishment and asked sarcastically, “EXCUSE ME?” (Definitely does not.)Two things that Okochi added to his batter that Swope didn’t were salty, pickled red ginger and yamaimo, a Japanese yam that, when grated, becomes viscous enough to act as a binder.“Different regions do different things,” Okochi says.It should be noted that the iteration of okonomiyaki discussed here is known as Osaka-style. In Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki, the cabbage and other savory ingredients are piled on top of a cooking pancake and layered with more batter. Sometimes, even noodles get added to the construction.Okochi slathered his pancake, made with shrimp, squid and pork belly, with a thick coating of okonomi sauce and lots of mayonnaise, bonito flakes and aonori.Throughout the process, he used the Japanese utensil of choice: a metal spatula that looks like a wide putty knife with a long handle. It does triple duty as a pancake flipper, wedge slicer and serving piece. He ate his okonomiyaki right off it.I asked Okochi whether the dish was meant as a snack or a meal.“It can be a meal as lunch, I guess,” he says. “In Osaka, they always eat rice with it, so the okonomiyaki is like a side dish. It’s like having a piece of bread while you’re eating a sandwich.”The pancake he served was thicker and creamier than ­Swope’s, but both chefs’ offerings certainly were substantial enough to make a meal.Adapting Swope’s recipe, I managed to create a more than credible version of okonomiyaki at home. The first order of business was assembling the Japanese ingredients, all of which I found at Hana Market at 17th and U streets in Northwest Washington.My endeavors would have been much easier and less time-consuming had I not opted to make my own dashi and tenkasu. Because I didn’t own a tabletop electric griddle like the one Okochi cooked on, I used a 12-inch nonstick saute pan. It required a bit of steely determination and confidence to flip the pancake over without having it wind up all over the stove, which it did on the first attempt. Simply using two spatulas as flippers gets the job done less dramatically.I tried traditional cabbage versions first, subbing broccoli slaw for cabbage in one of them, which worked beautifully. Graduating from there, I added shrimp, scallops and pickled ginger to my cabbage filling and decorate the pancake with the traditional sauces, plus bonito flakes (katsuobushi) and a seaweed-and-sesame topping used to flavor sushi rice (nori fumi furikake).Playing on a latke (potato pancake) theme, I topped one okonomiyaki with smoked salmon, slivered red onions, diced cucumber and wasabi mayonnaise. For a breakfast version, I made one with bacon and topped it with over-easy eggs and nori fumi furikake, a rice seasoning.For my last riff, I stretched the Japanese-pizza notion and fashioned an okonomiyaki margherita, melting fresh mozzarella on top and garnishing with squiggles of tomato paste and a chiffonade of basil.That might induce a purist to crinkle his nose, but too bad. It is as I like it, and that’s okonomi in my book.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Victim in recovery: Sarah Girouard
By — Joe Stephens, Just like last year, Sarah Girouard and a roommate from Northeastern University decided to spend the third Monday in April on Boylston Street, cheering on runners as they neared the Boston Marathon’s finish line. Then there was a blast and a burning sensation, and they were in adjoining hospital beds, both nursing shrapnel wounds.
For Girouard, a 20-year-old environmental science student, having someone she knew nearby in those early terrifying minutes was an incredible comfort, said her mother, Sue Girouard, who lives in Falmouth, Maine. More crime and safety newsPolice: 3 Alexandria slayings appear to be connected
Matt Zapotosky and Justin Jouvenal Bullets used to kill Ruthanne Lodato are similar to those used in slayings of two other residents, police said.
Man killed by Metro train at Waterfront station

Doctors said a piece of metal, perhaps a BB gun pellet, pierced Sarah Girouard’s right leg near her knee, passing through the bone and exiting cleanly. More damaging was a thumb-size chunk of metal that lodged near her heel, requiring surgery. No permanent damage is expected, her mother said, but Girouard will not be able to put weight on her right leg for some time.“The heel is like an eggshell,” Sue Girouard said. “That’s the tricky part.”“She’s a pretty tough cookie,” her mother added. “Fortunately, she didn’t see a lot of the horrific things that happened there. And it was comforting to her that she had someone with her that she knew, before we could get down there.” Northeastern has offered to move Sarah Girouard to a more accessible, first-floor apartment when she returns, her mother said. It remains unclear when she will be able to return to her work as an intern at Boston City Hall. After three days in a Boston hospital, she is recuperating, surrounded by family, at her aunt’s home in South Carolina. “Emotionally, she’s okay,” Sue Girouard said. “She’s a lot better than I am.”“Sarah could be so much worse. We’re very grateful.”
