Moten, Barry debate
By Christopher Dean Hopkins
Part 1:
Part 2:
D.C. Council member Marion Barry stumbled over his words while Peaceoholics co-founder Ronald Moten stumbled over his facts during a 15-minute debate Tuesday night on the Fox 5 10 p.m. newscast. Barry and Moten, both of whom have emerged as sideshows in the mayor's race, clashed with each other over their support for their favored candidates in the Sept. 14 Democratic primary.
Barry, a supporter of D.C. Council Chairman Vincent C. Gray, argued that "thousands" of residents are now "disappointed and disgusted" with Mayor Adrian M. Fenty's administration.
"He promised a clean government, that we were not going to have this culture of corruption," said Barry, noting that he supported Fenty in 2006. Moten, largely sticking to Fenty's talking points on the campaign trail, countered that the mayor deserves a second term because he is getting "results."
"Adrian Fenty has made some mistakes, just like Marion Barry has made some mistakes," Moten said in an apparent reference to Barry's arrest on drug charges in 1990. "I am kind of surprised that Marion wouldn't agree to forgive someone who has changed the city."
Moten said Fenty has built new grocery stores, schools, recreation centers, libraries and affordable housing units in Ward 8 since he took office. Moten, an ex-offender who mentors at-risk youth to try to prevent gang violence, cited gains at Ballou High school in Congress Heights as proof that the city has progressed under Fenty.
"Our children are happy. Our parents are happy," Moten said. "We demonize this man who has made some mistakes, but Marion has made a lot of mistakes and we forgave him."
Struggling throughout the debate to formulate his thoughts into words, Barry responded by asking, "What about the people?"
"You talk recreational centers. What about jobs for the parents of the children who go to recreational centers?" Barry asked. "What about housing? ... What about the minority business program? ... He manages by press conference as opposed to managing."
From there, the debate largely veered toward the gutter. Barry repeatedly implied that Fenty was responsible for Harriette Walters being able to steal nearly $50 million from the D.C. Tax Office. Walters, who was sentenced to 17 years in prison last year, stole most of her money from 2001 to 2007, before Fenty was mayor. Moten, meanwhile, stated at least twice that Gray gave "$500 million" in city contracts to his friends, which appears to be untrue. Under tough questioning from Brian Bolter, the Fox 5 anchor, Moten also was forced to respond to accusations that he is one Fenty's "cronies."
"Let me ask you, Ron," the anchor asked. "Are you getting millions of dollars from Mayor Fenty and simply preserving your interests by campaigning for him?"
Moten, whose organization has received at least $10 million since from the city since Fenty took office, responded he's "worked hard" with little pay for years.
"For nine years, I was almost a bum on the street," Moten said. "My grandmother kept telling me, 'Why do you keep on working hard for the city and you get nothing in return?' Mayor Fenty did not start supporting me. Anthony Williams started supporting me."
Later, Bolter asked Barry about concerns from some voters that a Gray administration would resemble the type of government Barry ran when he was mayor in the 1980s and 1990s.
"I don't buy that. I had an outstanding government," Barry said. "Vincent Gray and I have a forward vision for the city."
In one of the stranger moments of the debate, Moten suggested that Gray made his grandmother cry by releasing a campaign ad that refers to Moten as a crony. --Tim Craig

Stand Your Ground hearing: The risk for George Zimmerman and the prosecution
By Jonathan Capehart
George Zimmerman was ordered back behind bars last month after his $150,000 bond was revoked for lying about his financial circumstances. On June 29, he’ll have another opportunity to persuade the judge to let him go free on bond until his trial for the murder of Trayvon Martin. But the as-yet-unscheduled Stand Your Ground hearing could allow Zimmerman to go free without prosecution. A Stand Your Ground hearing is months away — if it happens at all. And if it does, there is a possibility that Zimmerman could walk for killing an unarmed teenager on a rainy night in February.
The Stand Your Ground (SYG) law is an insane 2005 statute that greatly expands the Castle Doctrine. That’s the longstanding legal right to defend yourself in your home or place of work without a duty to retreat before using deadly force. SYG now expands that zone of protection to wherever you have a legal right to be.
Florida statute 776.013(3) says: (a) person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.
Kendall Coffey, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 1993 to 1996, calls the SYG law a “license to kill.” That’s because the statute gives immunity from prosecution to those found not to be in violation of the law. And the way its broad language is being applied, it has become easier to kill someone without ever standing trial.
Zimmerman claimed self-defense in the Feb. 26 tragedy, and Sanford police officials let him walk out without pressing charges, citing SYG. Now that Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder, he and his lawyers will have to decide whether to to try to get the entire case thrown out using SYG. But there is risk for both sides in a SYG hearing.
Mark O’Mara, Zimmerman’s defense attorney, is under no statutory deadline for filing for a SYG hearing. It could be a while, regardless. He has said that he plans to interview 50 witnesses before going to trial next year. Coffey told me in a phone interview Friday afternoon that he thinks O’Mara will decide whether to go for a SYG hearing after conducting a few of the “important depositions.”
If O’Mara goes for such a hearing it would be a mini-trial, with the prosecution presenting its best case against Zimmerman. In a filing last month to keep his statements under seal until trial, prosecutors wrote, “Defendant (Zimmerman) has provided law enforcement with numerous statements, some of which are contradictory, and are inconsistent with the physical evidence and statements of witnesses.”
Coffey said that the risk for O’Mara and Zimmerman is that they would likely have to put Zimmerman on the stand at the SYG hearing, potentially exposing him to a difficult time in cross-examination that the prosecutors could use against him at the later trial if the case is not dismissed by the judge. Either side has 30 days to file an appeal of the SYG ruling.
But the decision at each step is in the hands of one person: Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester. The same judge Zimmerman and his wife lied to at the first bail hearing. The same judge who will decide whether the accused murderer awaits trial out of jail. The same judge who will determine whether SYG applies to the killer of Trayvon.
Zimmerman’s case rests on his veracity as much as it does on the evidence. That he already has a trust deficit with the judge is not good for him. But as we’ll see in the next post, proving through a preponderance of the evidence that Zimmerman was standing his ground might not be as difficult as folks at first thought. By	Jonathan Capehart

Stephen Colbert arrives in DC to unveil wax figure
By Emily Yahr
Can you tell which one is real?
(Emily Yahr - The Washington Post)
In a telling commentary about our time, Madame Tussauds in Washington on Friday moved dashing newsman Dan Rather to the gift shop to make room for faux newsman Stephen Colbert.
The unveiling of wax Colbert coincided with the DC museum renovating its Media Room, creating a replica set of Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report.” Gunga Dan, therefore, got relegated gift shop territory. (The museum general manager assured us it’s just a temporary move.) It was certainly a step down for the legendary CBS newsguy, noted Colbert, gleefully. Meanwhile, surviving the cut — wax Oprah, wax Katie Couric, wax Al Roker and wax Larry King, who doesn’t look any different from the real Larry King. Colbert arrived about 45 minutes late to the event — because he’s a big star these days. He stood dramatically in front of a black curtain that would fall to reveal his other self, in all its wax glory.
“I’m honored to be standing here next to my Man-Crayon, “ Colbert said triumphantly, reading a short speech from a piece of paper before the big reveal. “I learned this from the Madame Tussauds people just a minute ago — that on the color wheel, my skin tone is Semi-Gloss Romney Voter.” Polite chuckles from the members of the media assigned to cover the event, crammed into a corner. “I want to thank everyone at Madame Tussauds for the honor of becoming the latest Waxican American, because being cast in wax is true immortality — as long as the earth is not in any way getting warmer,” Colbert continued. “So without further ado, I present you all...the greatest American figurine since the Ken doll. And unlike Ken, this one is anatomically accurate.” The curtain dramatically fell, giving way to Colbert’s wax self, sitting at his desk, dressed in a dapper Brooks Brother suit, making giving a thumbs up sign and sporting the most raised eyebrow in the history of raised eyebrows. Wax Stephen Colbert...or is it?
(Emily Yahr - The Washington Post)
“I’m so beautiful!” Colbert gushed. Colbert posed for photos with wax Colbert.
Colbert snuggled with wax Colbert. Colbert began to lick wax Colbert’s face. (He stopped when the Madame Tussauds general manager told him licking the wax figures was not allowed.)
Then, and only then, did he take questions from the press. The headlines: * Colbert indeed no longer has a Super PAC.
* Colbert has no message to deliver to congress while he’s in DC.
* Colbert had no jokes about the former CIA director David Petraeus scandal, or remarks about Patraeus at Friday’s Benghazi hearings. “What he’s testifying about today isn’t funny,” Colbert said. * Colbert’s wife is excited about the wax figure, especially because it will give her something to show the kids next time they’re in DC. Will it freak out his kids? “Of course,” Colbert replied. “It freaks me out.” *Jon Stewart is not his frenemy, just one of his best friends, though Stewart is likely “burning with jealousy” about Colbert’s induction into Madame Tussauds.
The real Colbert (or is it?) talking to the media. (Emily Yahr - The Washington Post)
* Colbert thinks Nancy Pelosi should be the next political figure immortalized in wax, or John Boehner, who “has a waxy quality to him” anyway.
*Colbert was actually posing for the Madame Tussauds artists when he learned about the Supreme Court’s ruling on health care this past summer — though his staff told him it had been overturned, since CNN had reported the wrong information. And when he learned it actually passed, he still couldn’t budge an inch, since moving meant the artists would have to start over.
