Ernest Borgnine: Remembering eight of his smaller roles
By Jen Chaney
Ernest Borgnine, who died Sunday at the age of 95, led a pretty remarkable life. He won an Academy Award in 1956, a year in which his fellow best actor nominees were James Cagney, James Dean, Frank Sinatra and Spencer Tracy. He was married to Ethel Merman, his third of five wives, for about a month, less time than it took for Kim Kardashian to separate from Kris Humphries. Even more impressive, he remained happily wedded to his fifth wife, Tova Borgnine — the widow he sadly now leaves behind — for nearly 40 years.
View Photo Gallery: The Oscar-winning actor died in Los Angeles on Sunday. He was 95.
But what ultimately may be the most awe-inspiring thing about Ernest Borgnine is how prolific he was. He remained an active, steadily working actor well into his 90s; his capacity to pop up randomly in various movies and TV shows became one of his trademarks. It was simultaneously a pleasant surprise and no surprise at all to see him in contemporary films like “Red” or voicing the Mermaidman in “Spongebob Squarepants.” He was Borgnine, and Borgnine did nothing better than happily show up for work long after less hearty actors had retired. Most of Borgnine’s obituaries mentioned the big roles for which he was best known, like “From Here to Eternity,” the aforementioned “Marty,” McHale’s Navy” and, yes, “Spongebob.” But with roughly 200 credits on his resume, most tributes to him barely scratched the surface. So here’s a salute to eight of his smaller roles, which, again, barely scratches the surface. Got a favorite Borgnine moment? Please, share it in the comments. Related:
TV Column: Scheduled TV tributes to Borgnine
Borgnine in “Willard”
In this 1971 precursor to “Ben,” he gamely attempted to beat the heck out of some rats with a chair after the skeevy suckers ruined what otherwise seemed like a lovely dinner party. Of course, Borgnine’s character deserved it for being Willard’s lousy boss, but still ... gross.
Borgnine on “The Love Boat.”
He serenaded his “Poseidon Adventure” co-star Shelley Winters, then whisked her away on a Venetian gondola. This is back when TV shows understood romance, people.
Borgnine on “Magnum, P.I.”
A YouTube commenter wonders if the scene below explains all the “Magnum, P.I.” references on the TV show “My Name is Earl.” If so, it only deepens the Borgnine legacy. Borgnine in “Escape from New York”
As chauffeur to Kurt Russell’s Snake, he played a cabbie named, appropriately, Cabbie.
Borgnine in “Real Men Don’t Eat Gummy Bears”
I have never seen this 1989 movie, in which Borgnine apparently stars as a bishop in a story that, based on this synopsis., involved a lot of hilarious misunderstandings. But its title demonstrates that Borgnine would not be frightened away by even the most ridiculous-sounding projects. (Also, for the record, John Hillerman of “Magnum, P.I.” fame was in it, which adds additional credence to the “My Name is Earl”/“Magnum”/Borgnine conspiracy theory (see above).)
Borgnine on “Early Edition”
Yes, Borgnine once shared a screen with Coach Eric Taylor, Kyle Chandler, back when he was playing Gary Hobson, a man who mysteriously received an advance copy of the next day’s newspaper and used that information to prevent horrible events from happening. No, this TV show didn’t air in the 1950s; it ended its run — quaintly enough — in 2000. Anyway, you can see Borgnine in the clip below at around the 19-minute mark, while you can view Chandler making adorable facial expressions at pretty much any moment in this video.
Borgnine on “The Simpsons”
In the classic episode, “Boy-Scoutz N the Hood,” Borgnine played himself as a celebrity dad leading the Junior Campers on a dangerous expedition. Sadly, no clip exists online, a fact that distresses both me and this Forbes writer. I can, however, treat you to this fantastic musical number from the same episode, even though Borgnine isn’t in it. Sorry, it’s the best I can do. (Thanks for nothing, Internet!)
Borgnine in “Red”
In a film about old folks who demonstrate they still have what it takes, it was only appropriate that Borgnine, then 93, would play the guy who controls the documents that explain everything.

Going green could mean creating new jobs, Prince George’s officials say
By Miranda S. Spivack, E-mail the writer
Prince George’s County officials, bumping up against a Monday deadline to improve controls on storm water and polluting runoff that spills into local waterways, are proposing new fees and a management program they hope will also create jobs.
A 2009 lawsuit by environmental groups challenging state and federal management of pollution in the Chesapeake Bay is forcing several Maryland communities to do more to protect the bay and its tributaries.

More news about Md. politics
The administration of County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) recently announced its proposal, which must be approved by the County Council, to pay for a $1.2 billion program over the next decade to install new controls on county properties. The plans would cost homeowners up to $62 annually in fees but would give them a break if they did some storm-water management of their own. Homeowners and businesses would get credit for installing rain gardens with special plantings that soak up water or rain barrels to catch rain and reuse it or for planting a “green roof” to help slow and cleanse runoff.Businesses and religious institutions also would be subject to the fee, which would be $372 per acre of impervious surface, the term for parking lots, blacktop and other surfaces that allow unfiltered water carrying oil, trash and other pollutants to spill into streams and rivers.A large shopping center such as Bowie Town Center would pay about $12,000 annually and a small strip center would pay about $1,000 under the Baker administration plan, according to the proposed fees. A large church with extensive parking lots totaling about 18 acres would pay about $7,000, but small churches would pay a few hundred dollars annually.The county hopes to outsource much of the work for storm-water management to a public-private corporation that would be set up under the supervision of a county-appointed board, whose members would come from government, industry and community organizations. That company would be responsible for overseeing the installation and management of thousands of storm-water devices that must be placed on public property. Across the county, officials estimate that at least 8,000 acres — most of it on public land — need some type of new controls on storm water and its polluting runoff.Adam Ortiz, acting director of the county’s environmental resources department, estimates that the county will need 40,000 storm-water devices — rain barrels, rain gardens, water-absorbing sidewalks — to meet the mandate. He said the program would help improve water quality in streams and rivers and potentially spur the development of a “green” industry in the county.“We see this as a massive jobs program,” he said. Ortiz hopes that the demand for storm-water devices will attract companies to the county or spark the creation of ones. These companies would create and manufacture the devices. He estimates that the new industry could generate 5,000 jobs in the next decade in Prince George’s, based on modeling that the federal government did to estimate the effects of the recent stimulus program.The lawsuit was filed by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, several public officials and watermen’s groups and was settled in 2010 with a mandate for the federal government and states near the bay to do more to control runoff, though some jurisdictions have challenged that.
While Prince George’s was the last Maryland jurisdiction to announce its plans to comply with the mandate from the lawsuit, it is the first to get permission from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to set up the private-public enterprise to manage its program.Other jurisdictions affected by the lawsuit are handling the storm-water work in-house and are not directly involving the private sector in its management. For Prince George’s, which operates under a tighter property-tax cap than many other nearby jurisdictions, coming up with $200 million needed between now and 2017 to install the first round of storm-water control is a big challenge. Officials hope that a private company will come in and offer to front approximately $80 million, which the county eventually would repay once it began collecting fees.County officials also hope to create and expand training programs for workers in the new industry in tandem with the University of Maryland, Bowie State University and Prince George’s Community College. A handful of communities in Prince George’s already taking steps to manage storm water were well ahead of the county government. In tiny Forest Heights, near the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, basements used to flood almost every time there was a heavy rain. About five years ago, the town began installing a green roof of water-absorbing plants on top of town hall to soak up rainwater. Several rain gardens with similar plantings as the roof were created around the building on the ground. Special paving stone, known as pervious pavement, was installed to absorb water more efficiently, rather than letting it wash away unfiltered.Now, the flooding in private homes has abated, and there is less raging storm water spilling into nearby Oxon Run, a tributary of the Potomac River.“We want to have zero runoff in a two-inch storm,” said Forest Heights Mayor Jacqueline Goodall, who rounded up more than $700,000 in state and federal grants to cover the cost of the town’s storm-water management.

The not-quite-Free State: Maryland dragged its feet on emancipation during Civil War
Library of Congress/Library of Congress - Twenty-eight Fugitives Escaping from the Eastern Shore of Maryland.
By Miranda S. Spivack, E-mail the writer
Maryland calls itself the Free State, but it was in no hurry to give up slavery during the Civil War.
Elsewhere in the country, antislavery measures progressed rapidly. Congress freed the slaves in the District in 1862, compensating their owners. The Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the slaves in the states that had seceded, went into effect on Jan. 1, 1863. But Maryland didn’t act until 1864, when it held a referendum — and even then, the outcome wasn’t at all certain.

Letters from ‘The Lincoln Mailbag’
The vote tipped in favor of abolition only after the absentee ballots of soldiers fighting for the North were counted. The final tally was 30,174 in favor of freeing the slaves to 29,799 against.On Nov. 1, 1864, Maryland’s slaves were declared free, only a few months before Congress would approve the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. Many blacks in Maryland had taken matters into their own hands by that time, either escaping to the District or enlisting in the Union army, where they served as free men.Well known in the modern era for being a politically progressive state, especially on matters of civil and individual rights, Maryland came to that tradition slowly and with substantial reluctance. Indeed, as the Civil War loomed, much of Maryland remained firmly pro-slavery. Even such a Maryland luminary as Montgomery Blair, President Abraham Lincoln’s postmaster general, was more concerned about punishing secessionists and preserving the Union than advancing freedom for African Americans.“We are menaced by the ambition of the ultra-Abolitionists, which is equally despotic in its tendencies and which, if successful could not fail to be alike fatal to Republican institutions,” Blair told a gathering of the Unionist movement in Rockville on Oct. 3, 1863, even as antislavery forces appeared to be gaining support in the state and the nation.Blair, a confidant of Lincoln but a scion of a slaveholding family and a bitter foe of staunch abolitionists, was in many ways emblematic of Maryland’s landed aristocracy.“Much of the South’s wealth and economic powers stemmed from the institution of slavery, and that included border states such as Maryland,” said Christopher E. Haley, research director for the history of slavery in Maryland in the Maryland State Archives.Even the governor, Thomas H. Hicks of the Know Nothing Party, was a slaveholder. But like many in the border state, he also personified the conflict that stretched across Maryland, where some would fight for the North and others for the South. Hicks was a staunch supporter of the Union and would press hard for Maryland to remain part of that fragile coalition.To keep the Union intact, Lincoln would step gingerly when it came to Maryland and its slaveholders. Political expediency in pursuit of the high moral ground would be his method, allowing a slow march towards abolition. If Hicks and then his more liberal successor, Augustus Bradford, would ensure that Maryland stayed in the Union, Lincoln, temporarily at least, would look the other way on the question of slavery.“It was very much a divided state,” said University of Maryland historian Ira Berlin, a well-known scholar who specializes in the study of slavery. In some cases, families themselves were divided, with sons fighting on both sides.There were many signs of the fragility of the state’s pro-Union position in the years leading up to the Civil War, especially evident in an urban-rural divide.Baltimore was growing into a center of trade and industry. It was populated by a mostly free work force with one of the largest urban populations of free blacks in the United States, larger than in Philadelphia or New York, Berlin said. And it was the political epicenter of the Maryland abolition movement, with a leading newspaper, the Baltimore American, instrumental in the push to end slavery.“With Free States on both sides of her, who would care to own negroes here? And what possible advantage would we have over those obnoxious to the terms of the President’s manifesto in other states? As the matter stands even at present, negro property here has become so uncertain in the tenure that in many portions of our commonwealth, they are as good as free already,” the paper editorialized on Sept. 24, 1862.But outside the city, in the vast agricultural areas of Southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore, slavery was a way of life, much as it was in the rest of the white South, where tobacco was giving way to labor-intensive crops such as cotton, rice and sugar.“Southern Maryland was certainly a southern state; it is agriculture, plantations . . . in some ways it is not much different from Mississippi, both in size and in their lucrative nature,” Berlin said. Slaveholders’ determination to maintain their human property was a crucial element in the white southern culture, he said.Other large swaths of Maryland, from Prince George’s to Montgomery County, north to Frederick and west, were also pro-slavery, although Frederick itself was a divided community.Lincoln, aware of the divisions and the pressure on Maryland politicians from secessionists and slaveholders, knew that keeping Maryland and the other border states — Delaware, Kentucky and Missouri — in the Union meant he would need to essentially ignore their slave holdings.When Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, he limited it to states that had seceded.“He freed the slaves over which he had no control at that point,” said Haley of the Maryland State Archives. “That is the reality of the Emancipation Proclamation.”Meanwhile, an aggressive Col. William Birney, son of Kentucky antislavery politician James G. Birney, was busy recruiting slaves into service in the Union army, spiriting them away from their Maryland owners, liberating them from jails and from slave pens where they were being held before sales. One account said that black slaves in a Frederick jail threw a rock with a note to an imprisoned recruiter to let him know they wanted to join the Union forces. Birney’s zealous approach worried the Lincoln administration, which was getting complaints from slaveholders. Birney was unmoved, and his recruiters pressed on, usually neglecting to ask potential black recruits whether they were free. They simply signed them up.Blair, like many from slaveholding families in Maryland, would bow to the inevitability of emancipation. Writing on April 5, 1863, in the Washington Star, Blair said the issue of slavery could no longer be avoided. “The question is upon us, and all that we can do is to say on which side we shall range ourselves. To be debating whether it is better or worse for us to have it, is like debating whether the ruin that is falling is needed.“I know indeed that too many of our friends are so afraid of the Slavery question, or rather are so terrified at the Secession howl of “Abolitionists,” that they persuade themselves that they can dodge the issue . . . but the war now drenching the land in blood, which is due to this timidity, should at least teach us that to cower before traitors and to adopt their slang, is alike inconsistent with patriotism and self-respect.”Many Maryland slaves already had absconded. John Boston, a slave from Owensville, was among many in the vanguard of the exodus, joining up with a regiment from New York billeted in Virginia.In January 1862, he wrote to his wife, whom he had left behind:“My Dear Wife it is with grate joy I take this time to let you know Whare i am now in Safety in the 14th Regiment of Brooklyn . . . this Day i can Adress you thank god as a free man I had a little truble in giting away But as the lord led the Children of Isrel to the land of Canon So he led me to a land Whare fredom Will rain in spite Of earth and hell Dear you must make your Self content i am free from al the Slavers Lash . . . I am With a very nice man and have All that hart Can Wish But My Dear I Cant express my grate desire that i Have to See you i trust the time Will Come When We Shal meet again And if We dont met on earth We Will Meet in heven Whare Jesas ranes . . .”But most of Maryland’s 87,000 slaves would wait. Once the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, they puzzled over their own status. In a letter to Lincoln 18 months after the Emancipation Proclamation, Annie Davis of Belair in Harford County asked in August 1864 if the slaves were free. Her owner had said she could not leave and visit her family.In elegant script, Davis wrote:“Dear Mr. President, It is my desire to be free to go see my people on the Eastern Shore. My mistress won’t let me. Will you please let me know if we are free. . .” At the time, the answer was still no.But the next month, delegates to a Maryland constitutional convention approved a new constitution that abolished slavery, after arguing for days over whether the Bible endorsed or reviled slavery.The Rev. Robert Todd, a Methodist minister from Caroline County, was among those pushing for abolition.“Is it true that because a human being is born in Africa, and with a black skin, a man born in Europe or America, and with a fair skin, has the right to enslave him — to deprive him of his God-like and God-given liberty? . . . Sir, he that claims that slavery is not a violation of natural right, must answer these questions affirmatively,” Todd argued.Isaac D. Jones of Somerset County, a bastion of slaveholders, said he recognized that the majority of the delegates would vote to abolish slavery. So he tried a different argument, urging his fellow delegates to move slowly to emancipate slaves for the good of the slaves themselves. “Winter will be approaching,” he said. “If those slaves now comfortably housed, clothed and fed themselves . . . I suggest to those who are unacquainted with the condition of this unfortunate class of people what will be approaching winter with the present high prices of food, the present high prices of clothing? Where will they find a home?”The delegates eventually approved abolition and put the new constitution to a referendum by popular vote, where the pro-slavery forces were ahead — until the absentee ballots of Union soldiers were counted.For Maryland, it was the culmination of a move toward greater liberties that Lincoln had been nudging along, mostly behind the scenes.“Before the Emancipation Proclamation, he says to leaders of border states such as Maryland, ‘Look, guys, it is over. I will support compensated emancipation. You can get paid off,’ ” said Berlin.“Of course, they ignore him, tell him ‘no deal, forget about it.’ They blow him off,” Berlin said.But Lincoln, ever patient, stood firm.“Eventually, he says, ‘This train is leaving the station whether you guys are on it or not.’ ”Yet even after Maryland’s emancipation on Nov. 1, 1864, former slaves faced problems.Owners evicted slaves from their modest homes, or refused to pay wages and apprenticed their children into long-term contracts. Some even tried to go after former slaves who, they said, owed them money. In an incident recounted in “Freedom,” a multi-volume series that Berlin co-wrote, a sheriff arrested a freed slave in Washington in March 1866 — almost two years after Maryland emancipated its slaves — and took him to Maryland. There he was accused of using his former master’s horse and cart while attempting to escape with his family in 1863.For many Maryland slaves, freedom, while formally granted, remained elusive.Berlin said the end of slavery in Maryland was clearly a big step in the continuing struggle of blacks to achieve a better life. But challenges remained.From “Freedom:” “The day after emancipation thus found black men and women in the same ambiguous positions as on the day before: between slavery and freedom, struggling to define a new free status for themselves.”That would take another century.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
The Post’s View
A central nuclear waste repository is years away
By Editorial Board, IT HAS BEEN 15 years since the federal government was legally obliged — but failed — to begin accepting waste from the country’s nuclear power plants. It has been four years since President Obama zeroed out funds for a permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nev., eliminating hope that the government would live up to its obligation anytime soon. And, according to the Obama administration’s new strategy for dealing with nuclear waste, it will be another 35 years until the government opens a permanent repository at a different site, location as yet unknown. Even if the government meets its new timetable, that adds up to 50 years of delay, a not-in-my-back-yard nightmare that the country is only partway through.
More than 68,000 metric tons of nuclear waste have accumulated next to U.S. reactors, which weren’t designed for long-term storage, and that figure is increasing by about 2,000 metric tons every year. Even decommissioned nuclear facilities require gates and guards to protect the waste, a ridiculous misuse of land and money. Meanwhile, consumers financing a federal waste disposal fund through their electricity bills wonder what they’ve been paying for, and the federal government’s financial liability for failing to collect the waste, already in the billions, continues to mount. The situation is safe enough, but it could be safer, and it’s inexcusably expensive.

Apply the brakes
Editorial Board The Secret Service needs to avoid so many main road closures.
Since the president helped to kill the Yucca project, his administration has borne a particular responsibility to devise a workable way to clean up this mess. Last month the Energy Department finally released its proposal. It is a reasonable plan for post-Yucca policymaking that nevertheless relies on a big assumption — that someplace in the country will volunteer to host some waste.The administration wants to build at least two centralized, interim storage facilities where waste could sit before its eventual transfer to a permanent repository. The first, to open by 2021, would be a pilot storage facility designed to take waste from decommissioned nuclear sites. The second would open by 2025; in combination, these facilities would draw down the amount of waste stored at current and decommissioned reactor sites. When the anticipated permanent repository comes online — supposedly by 2048 — the waste would move there. Every step, the administration insists, must be “consent-based,” with localities accepting waste facilities in return for their economic benefits and perhaps some additional compensation. Congress tried forcing Nevada to take the country’s waste, the thinking goes; this time, the government should try recruitment rather than compulsion. We are skeptical that many localities would volunteer to host waste facilities, particularly the permanent repository, no matter the economic benefits. But perhaps the administration’s staged approach might be a way to convince communities, with each step building confidence that this material can be stored safely.

NSA seeks to build quantum computer that could crack most types of encryption
By Steven Rich and Barton Gellman, E-mail the writers
In room-size metal boxes ­secure against electromagnetic leaks, the National Security Agency is racing to build a computer that could break nearly every kind of encryption used to protect banking, medical, business and government records around the world.
According to documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the effort to build “a cryptologically useful quantum computer” — a machine exponentially faster than classical computers — is part of a $79.7 million research program titled “Penetrating Hard Targets.” Much of the work is hosted under classified contracts at a laboratory in College Park, Md.

Barton Gellman His leaks have fundamentally altered the U.S. government’s relationship with its citizens, the rest of the world.
Full coverage: NSA Secrets
Read all of the stories in The Washington Post’s ongoing coverage of the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs.
"If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics," said the late Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, widely regarded as the pioneer in quantum computing. The science video blog Vertiasium tries to help make sense of it.
[Read an annotated description of the Penetrating Hard Targets project]
The development of a quantum computer has long been a goal of many in the scientific community, with revolutionary implications for fields such as medicine as well as for the NSA’s code-breaking mission. With such technology, all current forms of public key encryption would be broken, including those used on many secure Web sites as well as the type used to protect state secrets.
Physicists and computer scientists have long speculated about whether the NSA’s efforts are more advanced than those of the best civilian labs. Although the full extent of the agency’s research remains unknown, the documents provided by Snowden suggest that the NSA is no closer to success than others in the scientific community.“It seems improbable that the NSA could be that far ahead of the open world without anybody knowing it,” said Scott Aaronson, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The NSA appears to regard itself as running neck and neck with quantum computing labs sponsored by the European Union and the Swiss government, with steady progress but little prospect of an immediate breakthrough. “The geographic scope has narrowed from a global effort to a discrete focus on the European Union and Switzerland,” one NSA document states.Seth Lloyd, an MIT professor of quantum mechanical engineering, said the NSA’s focus is not misplaced. “The E.U. and Switzerland have made significant advances over the last decade and have caught up to the U.S. in quantum computing technology,” he said.The NSA declined to comment for this article.The documents, however, indicate that the agency carries out some of its research in large, shielded rooms known as Faraday cages, which are designed to prevent electromagnetic energy from coming in or out. Those, according to one brief description, are required “to keep delicate quantum computing experiments running.”
[Read a document describing classification levels related to quantum computing efforts]
The basic principle underlying quantum computing is known as “quantum superposition,” the idea that an object simultaneously exists in all states. A classical computer uses binary bits, which are either zeroes or ones. A quantum computer uses quantum bits, or qubits, which are simultaneously zero and one. This seeming impossibility is part of the mystery that lies at the heart of quantum theory, which even theoretical physicists say no one completely understands.“If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don’t understand quantum mechanics,” said the late Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, who is widely regarded as the pioneer in quantum computing.Here’s how it works, in theory: While a classical computer, however fast, must do one calculation at a time, a quantum computer can sometimes avoid having to make calculations that are unnecessary to solving a problem. That allows it to home in on the correct answer much more quickly and efficiently.Quantum computing is difficult to attain because of the fragile nature of such computers. In theory, the building blocks of such a computer might include individual atoms, photons or electrons. To maintain the quantum nature of the computer, these particles would need to be carefully isolated from their external environments.“Quantum computers are extremely delicate, so if you don’t protect them from their environment, then the computation will be useless,” said Daniel Lidar, a professor of electrical engineering and the director of the Center for Quantum Information Science and Technology at the University of Southern California.A working quantum computer would open the door to easily breaking the strongest encryption tools in use today, including a standard known as RSA, named for the initials of its creators. RSA scrambles communications, making them unreadable to anyone but the intended recipient, without requiring the use of a shared password. It is commonly used in Web browsers to secure financial transactions and in encrypted ­e-mails. RSA is used because of the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Breaking the encryption involves finding those two numbers. This cannot be done in a reasonable amount of time on a classical computer.In 2009, computer scientists using classical methods were able to discover the primes within a 768-bit number, but it took almost two years and hundreds of computers to factor it. The scientists estimated that it would take 1,000 times longer to break a 1,024-bit encryption key, which is commonly used for online transactions.A large-scale quantum computer, however, could theoretically break a 1,024-bit encryption much faster. Some leading Internet companies are moving to 2,048-bit keys, but even those are thought to be vulnerable to rapid decryption with a quantum computer.Quantum computers have many applications for today’s scientific community, including the creation of artificial intelligence. But the NSA fears the implications for national security. “The application of quantum technologies to encryption algorithms threatens to dramatically impact the US government’s ability to both protect its communications and eavesdrop on the communications of foreign governments,” according to an internal document provided by Snowden.Experts are not sure how soon a quantum computer would be feasible. A decade ago, some experts said that developing a large quantum computer was likely 10 to 100 years in the future. Five years ago, Lloyd said the goal was at least 10 years away. Last year, Jeff Forshaw, a professor at the University of Manchester, told Britain’s Guardian newspaper, “It is probably too soon to speculate on when the first full-scale quantum computer will be built but recent progress indicates that there is every reason to be optimistic.”“I don’t think we’re likely to have the type of quantum computer the NSA wants within at least five years, in the absence of a significant breakthrough maybe much longer,” Lloyd told The Washington Post in a recent interview.Some companies, however, claim to already be producing small quantum computers. A Canadian firm, D-Wave Systems
, says it has been making quantum computers since 2009. In 2012, it sold a $10 million version to Google, NASA and the Universities Space Research Association, according to news reports.That quantum computer, however, would never be useful for breaking public key encryption like RSA.“Even if everything they’re claiming is correct, that computer, by its design, cannot run Shor’s algorithm,” said Matthew Green, a research professor at the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute, referring to the algorithm that could be used to break encryption like RSA.Experts think that one of the largest hurdles to breaking encryption with a quantum computer is building a computer with enough qubits, which is difficult given the very fragile state of quantum computers. By the end of September, the NSA expected to be able to have some building blocks, which it described in a document as “dynamical decoupling and complete quantum ­control on two semiconductor qubits.” “That’s a great step, but it’s a pretty small step on the road to building a large-scale quantum computer,” Lloyd said.A quantum computer capable of breaking cryptography would need hundreds or thousands more qubits than that.The budget for the National Intelligence Program, commonly referred to as the “black budget,” details the “Penetrating Hard Targets” project and noted that this step “will enable initial scaling towards large systems in related and follow-on efforts.”Another project, called “Owning the Net,” is using quantum research to support the creation of quantum-based attacks on encryptions like RSA, documents show.“The irony of quantum computing is that if you can imagine someone building a quantum computer that can break encryption a few decades into the future, then you need to be worried right now,” Lidar said.
