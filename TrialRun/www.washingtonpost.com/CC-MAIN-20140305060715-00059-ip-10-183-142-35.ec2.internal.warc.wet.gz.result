Apple, a year after Steve Jobs
Paul Sakuma/AP - In this June 7, 2010, file photo, Apple CEO Steve Jobs smiles with a new iPhone at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco. By Hayley Tsukayama, E-mail the writer
There are conflicting storylines out there about Apple in the post-Steve Jobs era.
One comes from its balance sheet. In the year since the Apple co-founder died at the age of 56, his company has flourished. The company has set record sales for the iPhone and the iPad. It’s the most valuable company in the world. And its stock has skyrocketed — from around $377 a share on the day Jobs died to more than $650 Friday. In a statement, Apple chief executive Tim Cook paid tribute to his former boss and reaffirmed that Jobs’s ideals run deep at the company. “Our values originated from Steve and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple,” Cook wrote Friday. “We share the great privilege and responsibility of carrying his legacy into the future.”The other storyline, one that warns Apple is losing its grip, is harder to pin down. Despite financial successes, critics have dogged Apple since Jobs’s death, asking if the hunger for cutting-edge perfection that Jobs made the heart of the company died with him. There are three main problems that have Apple critics see. The first, they say, is that Steve Jobs, for all intents and purposes, was the company. “It’s almost a cultish culture there and a cultish base of consumers,” said Gene Grabowski, executive vice president at the Washington-area strategic communications firm Levick. “At Apple ,it really counts who’s CEO.” Though it’s actually been almost two years since Jobs ran the day-to-day operations at Apple, criticism didn’t hit a fever pitch until the company released its first earnings report under chief executive Tim Cook. Apple missed analyst expectations for the first time in years.Which brings us to the second element cited by critics: There are signs that Apple is changing. The new iPad, iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 sold like hotcakes, but also drew a lot of criticism for being iterative instead of innovative. Apple broke ground with the first versions of those products. The follow-ups, to some, have been like Apple pulling its weeds.“Their genius is in creating whole new categories,” said Columbia Business School professor Rita McGrath. “I haven’t seen evidence that they’re doing that again. I think it would be very hard for anybody to do that.”Apple bears also say that product quality has dropped, pointing to Siri and Apple Maps — both programs that shipped before they were fully polished. Yet not everything Jobs touched turned to gold, either. The company’s MobileMe service was a big flop, as was its iTunes-associated social network service Ping.Part of what has changed at Apple, McGrath noted, is that it’s no longer the scrappy boutique brand. It’s the most valuable company in the world. Sometimes it acts accordingly.“It’s starting to feel more like a regular company,” McGrath said. “It’s got a lot to lose now.” Any misstep, notably Apple’s decision to swap out Google’s Maps app for its own, less-developed, software, becomes reason enough for Cook to write an open letter of apology on the company Web site. Which brings us to our third component: Tim Cook is no Steve Jobs. Almost no one questions that Cook knows how to run the company. Cook served as acting chief executive during all of Jobs’ medical leaves, making it clear he was the company’s hand-picked successor. He’s also the one credited with building Apple’s supply chain. Under his watch, Apple’s become more transparent about its labor practices, started matching charitable donations and been more open with its customers.But he’s more reserved than Jobs, and not the kind of salesman who can convince customers they need a product they didn’t even know about two months before. “I think Tim is really great at what he does,” said Ken Segall, a former Apple advertising executive. “But most people, including Tim, probably agree he is not the visionary that Steve was.”To compensate for that, Cook has essentially split Jobs’s role as chief executive and chief innovator among other top Apple executives such as marketing head Phil Schiller and Apple’s head designer, Jony Ive. Jobs was a “very special person, there will never be another one like him,” said Segall. “But Apple will encounter situations that Steve could never have dreamed of. You can’t expect it to be exactly as it was under Steve.”

When celebrations collide, bruised feelings may result
By Carolyn Hax, Dear Carolyn: Last spring we attended the wedding of my husband’s best friend. When we visited the couple the year before, they threw out a couple of dates they were considering. When the fiancee mentioned one date, my husband, the groom-to-be and I all said, “Oh, that’s Jason’s 40th.” My husband and I don’t know the bride very well.
So, months later I was surprised to receive a wedding invitation for . . . the birthday date. I feel they should’ve tried to secure a different date, knowing the groom’s best friend of 25 years was turning 40 that day. My husband has a congenital illness, so the fact that he even reached 40 was a huge deal.

Ask Amy: Girlfriend wants ex-wife to stay in the barn
She the People
Women to watch at CPAC
The conservative gathering gives activists a chance to mull over “the woman problem,” yet not many high-profile, elected women will be on the stage.
More
I knew my husband was hurt, but I tried to soften the situation by saying, “Look at it this way: All of your friends will be in one place on your birthday,” and, “Maybe that’s the only time they could get. Let’s make a fun trip out of it.”Days before the wedding the groom asked my husband to give a toast. Jason gave a heartfelt, lovely toast but there was no acknowledgement, or a thank-you, or even something like, “By the way it’s his 40th! Happy birthday!” Actually, the groom did thank him, but the bride never said thank you or happy birthday. So, on top of being [peeved] about the situation, Jason had to stress out all day on his 40th about giving a speech later that night. I think a thank-you from the bride would’ve been nice.I’m still bitter about this whole thing but my husband really can’t let it go. I just need an outside voice to tell me, “Yes, that was rude. And she was rude.” — Stacey
What if the outside voice tells you the bride may have been preoccupied, understandably and forgivably so, on her wedding day? Or that not everyone considers an adult birthday to be as big a deal as you and your husband do? I can speak only for myself, but it wouldn’t occur to me to avoid marrying on a friend’s birthday, and any friend who wants to get married on my birthday is welcome to (though if it’s my 50th, I request an open bar). I get that his illness gives his birthdays tremendous significance for you both. That, too, is understandable. It’s also possible the bride is rude, possessive, self-absorbed.In cases when you have reasonably strong feelings, though — or even unreasonably strong ones — it’s best to say that outright: “Jason’s 40th is a huge deal to us, so I hope you’ll be able to choose a different date.” Then you’d have had grounds to be all kinds of perturbed — not if the couple chose that date, but only if they didn’t explain or apologize for it. Wedding dates, after all, are too often hostage to the availability of venue, vendors, parents, siblings, Grandpa, vacation times, favorable honeymoon fares and weather, and any number of priorities that aren’t for us to deem legitimate. And if you had seen this (theoretical) lack of apology or explanation as a grudge-worthy offense, then you and your husband would have owed it to his friendship to say something to the friend, before the event, to give him a chance to make it up to your husband somehow — or just know where the raw spots were. The way it actually played out, it appears you’re both upset about this couple’s failure to show respect for feelings you never told them you had. And that’s too bad, because this grudge appears already to have stomped on any budding affection you felt for the bride, which no doubt will weaken this quarter-century best-friendship, if it hasn’t already. It’s time for your husband (and you, his echo chamber), to decide: Was the couple’s lapse really worth the price he’s asking this friendship to pay? Or is there more to this? It’s hard to imagine bringing a best friendship to an abrupt and silent end over the failure to say, “Happy birthday.” Air it or drop it — whatever the true grievance is.* * *
Dear Carolyn: My boyfriend asked me to travel with him to visit his family. I was told he has NEVER brought a girl home before. The trip falls near my 30th birthday. I had been planning a blowout vacation for my birthday. There is no way I can do both trips. Is it selfish of me to take a pass on the family trip? — Selfish?
Your time, your money, your call.Just know that choosing the “blowout vacation” might tell your boyfriend you’re not as invested in him as he is in you. Nothing wrong with that, of course, if it’s true — and you’re kind about it. Selfishness applies when you don’t care who gets hurt as long as you get what you want.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
James Buchanan, GMU economist who won Nobel
By Matt Schudel, E-mail the writer
James M. Buchanan, a Nobel Prize-winning economist from George Mason University, whose opposition to deficit spending and support of a balanced-budget amendment helped shape conservative economic and political thought, died Jan. 9 at a hospital in Blacksburg. He was 93.
The death was confirmed by a nephew, Jeff Whorley, who said he could not cite a specific cause. He noted that his “Uncle Buck” had traveled to Europe in the past year and lived alone on a working farm outside Blacksburg.
(Charles K. Crockett/THE WASHINGTON POST) - James M. Buchanan in his office at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., on June 26, 1985. Since 1956, Dr. Buchanan had spent most of his career in Virginia, teaching at the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech before joining the faculty at George Mason in 1983. He won the Nobel Prize in 1986 for being a key architect of the school of economic thought known as public choice. In simplified form, Dr. Buchanan applied the principles of the economic marketplace to politics. He argued that politicians and government officials — like other participants in an economic system — acted in their own self-interest. Since the policymakers’ goal was to be reelected or maintain power, they did not always act in the best interest of the public, or at least of public finances. Lawmakers routinely voted for programs popular with their constituents, Dr. Buchanan maintained, but they were reluctant to ask for corresponding tax increases. “Their natural proclivity is to spend more and not tax,” he explained to Time magazine in 1986. By refusing to make a choice between taxing and spending, the politicians ended up driving the economy into a cycle of ever-spiraling budget deficits.“His big contribution,” Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Wednesday, “is that he got our profession to think of government policymakers not as platonic philosophers but as interested parties in their own right who are furthering their own views, at least some extent.”Dr. Buchanan and his onetime colleague, Gordon Tullock, outlined the “public choice” model in their 1962 book “The Calculus of Consent,” which became a major theoretical basis for conservative and libertarian economic thinkers. Their view represented a stark departure from the long-prevailing economic views of John Maynard Keynes, who held that deficit spending was a useful tool for advancing the public good through government programs.“Keynesian economics turned the politicians loose,” Dr. Buchanan wrote in 1978. Dr. Buchanan was also a longtime advocate for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, saying politicians would not stop spending unless forced. “There’s a natural proclivity for them to create deficits unless they are constrained by some moral rule or some constitutional rule,” he told The Washington Post in 1986.Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), a sponsor of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of the 1980s, once described Dr. Buchanan as the first economist “to bring to bear the basic logic of economics to public-policy decision-making.”Some scholars were not as receptive to his economic solutions, calling them simplistic and unoriginal. But Dr. Buchanan, who had disdain for what he called the “Eastern academic elite,” said his ideas reflected “simple applications of common sense that the academics all forget about.”James McGill Buchanan Jr. was born Oct. 3, 1919, in Murfreesboro, Tenn. His grandfather was a Tennessee governor in the 1890s, but Dr. Buchanan grew up in rural poverty “without indoor plumbing, electricity, radio, television, or air travel,” he wrote in an autobiographical essay. He graduated from Middle Tennessee State University in 1940 and received a master’s degree in economics from the University of Tennessee in 1941. During World War II, he served on the staff of Navy Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, commander of the Pacific fleet.Dr. Buchanan received his doctorate in economics in 1948 from the University of Chicago, long a center of market-oriented economic thought.He taught at the University of Tennessee and Florida State University before going to U-Va. in 1956 as head of the economics department. He founded a center for the study of political economy at Virginia, then joined the faculty at Virginia Tech in 1969. Although he had been affiliated since 1983 with George Mason — and was the Fairfax-based university’s first Nobel laureate — Dr. Buchanan continued to live on his 400-acre farm outside Blacksburg, where he raised cattle and grew vegetables.His wife of 60 years, Anne Bakke Buchanan, died in 2005. Survivors include two sisters.In 2007, Dr. Buchanan retired from George Mason’s Center for Study of Public Choice — which he had founded at Virginia Tech — but he continued to deliver occasional lectures and work on projects until his death.His other books included “Fiscal Theory and Political Economy” (1960), “The Limits of Liberty” (1975), “Freedom in Constitutional Contract” (1978), “Liberty, Market and State” and a 10-volume collection of other writings. Even Dr. Buchanan’s staunchest admirers admitted that he was forbidding and hardly had a warm personality.“I want a private sphere in which I am protected, where nobody can invade,” he told the Chicago Tribune in 1986. “I don’t feel the need to be a part of a community or a team.”

Japan ruling bloc cruises to victory in parliamentary election
Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images - Japanese Prime Minister and President of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Shinzo Abe celebrates his party's win after he placed a red paper rose on a LDP candidate's name to indicate an election victory at the party's headquarters in Tokyo on July 21, 2013. Voters gave Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a resounding victory in upper house elections exit polls showed.
By Chico Harlan, E-mail the writer
TOKYO — Japanese voters dealt a runaway election victory Sunday to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in a strong sign of approval for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ambitious plan to revive the world’s third-largest economy.
Sunday’s vote, for seats in the upper house of parliament, gives Abe’s ruling bloc control of both chambers — and it provides Abe with a mandate unmatched by any Japanese leader in nearly a decade.

Bombings, clashes in Iraq kill at least 42
Associated Press No one claimed responsibility for the string of bombings, mostly from parked car bombs and one explosive planted in an outdoor market. How Abe uses that political power will help determine the long-term health of Japan’s economy and its relations with Asian neighbors. Analysts say Abe could pursue a largely economic agenda, one that includes difficult but needed reforms and austerity measures. But Abe, known as a strong nationalist, also could feel emboldened to speak more openly about his revisionist view of Asian history, one that rejects the idea of Japanese imperial invasion and infuriates China and South ­Korea.In this election, only half of the 242 seats in the upper house were up for grabs. According to final results announced early Monday, the LDP and coalition partner New Komeito together claimed 76 seats — giving them total of 135 in the chamber, a comfortable majority. The LDP won 65 of those seats, just shy of the 72 it would have needed to form a majority on its own.“We received so much support from the people of Japan,” Abe said in a victory speech at his party’s headquarters. “We now have to move politics forward.” Japan isn’t required by law to hold another parliamentary election for three years, and pundits say Abe could go as long as that without a challenge to his power, provided he maintains support from his own party. Such stability would mark a fundamental shift for a nation that has cycled through seven leaders since 2006, none lasting longer than 481 days in office. Abe was one of those short-term leaders, holding power for a scandal-filled year before resigning in September 2007 because of an intestinal ailment, his approval rating below 30 percent.Abe says he has learned from that stint, and in his second chance at the job — beginning seven months ago — he has spent less time on nationalist pet projects, devoting himself instead to the issue that Japanese voters care most about: the economy. With full-throttle monetary easing and fiscal stimulus, Abe has lowered the value of the yen and driven up the stock market, all as companies rake in profits and business confidence soars. Average consumers haven’t seen the benefits — they will, Abe promises — but they say they like the ambition of Abe’s policy­making.As part of his economic revival plan, Abe has pledged a set of reforms. One batch, unveiled before the election, left investors unimpressed. But economists hope that Abe can use his political capital to overhaul the pension system, free companies to more easily hire and fire workers, and clear away some of Japan’s burdensome government debt. Japan has a “three-year window to start fiscal consolidation and structural reform,” Barclays Bank researchers wrote in a note to investors.Abe on Sunday night said his party’s real test is set to begin. “I believe people want the economic policies to [give them] something tangible,” he said.But some opposition policymakers in Japan warn that Abe could focus on right-wing goals, a more controversial agenda that includes patriotic education for youngsters and looser restrictions on Japan’s Self-Defense Forces. Abe also could take a harder approach with China amid a fierce dispute over a small island chain. During a rare trip last week to Japan’s front-line islands, Abe said the “security environment facing Japan is becoming ever more severe.”Whatever his next steps, Abe will have an easier time taking them than previous leaders, who contended with a “twisted Diet” where different parties ruled the two chambers. Now, Japan again looks much like a one-party state — a throwback to the ­half-century following World War II, when the LDP ruled almost without interruption.The LDP that guided Japan’s postwar rise was a monolith. It straddled the left and right. It spent on massive public works projects and engineered a manufacturing-driven economic miracle. It held support from farmers and housewives, executives and bureaucrats.Between 2009 and December 2012, the LDP was on the sidelines, booted from power by voters frustrated with its inability to fix a stagnant economy. Analysts say that this time around, the LDP isn’t nearly as entrenched as it used to be.But it has managed to rebuild support among Japan’s major bloc of unaffiliated voters. According to opinion polling from national public broadcaster NHK, the LDP’s approval rating a year ago was 20 percent; more than 50 percent supported no party at all. Now, 43 percent support the LDP — and no other party has an approval rating higher than 8 percent.Those minority parties have self-inflicted wounds. The Democratic Party of Japan, which ruled during the LDP’s retreat, was undone by three prime ministers who pursued opposite policies. The recently formed Japan Restoration Party lost its support in short order, undone by remarks from one of its leaders, an iconoclastic right-winger who said that sex slaves were “necessary” for Japanese soldiers during war. The DPJ — which held 44 of the 121 seats up for grabs — managed to win back 17. The Japan Restoration Party won eight.
