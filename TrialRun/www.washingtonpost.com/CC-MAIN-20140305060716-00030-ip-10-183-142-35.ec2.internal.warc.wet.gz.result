10:11 PMRyan Seacrest: What are you doing here?“American Idol.” A top-40 radio show. New Year’s Rockin’ Eve. E! News. Why does he need the Olympics too? Why did his hollow interview with Michael Phelps take the place of the opening-ceremony tribute to the victims of the 7/7 terrorist attacks? Let us have the Olympics to ourselves, RyRy.

9:55 PMWhy do we watch when we know the outcome?[Spoilers ahead!] NBC just played a gauzy montage that dramatized gymnast Jordyn Wieber’s dreams — to follow in the footsteps of all-around champions Carly Patterson and Nastia Liukin — against her failure to make the all-around finals. Wieber, in scripted narration, said that she wants to be remembered for something else, something more. We all know that she won the team gold earlier today (“something else, something more”) and yet NBC insists on this masquerade of suspense. What does everyone think of this? Why are we all watching now? Have any of you willfully ignored today’s news in order to watch this telecast in a virgin state? (If so, I apologize for the spoiler.)

8:52 PMThe Magnificent Seven: Where are they now?The Fabulous Five? Pffft. Watching them only makes us nostalgic for the Magnificent Seven gymnasts of our younger Olympics.
Team USA's Kerri Strug is carried by her coach, Bela Karolyi. (John Gaps III / AP)
Where are those former gold medalists now? In Washington! Or two of them, anyway.
Dominique Dawes lives in Rockville, works for the Presidents Fitness Council, coaches gymnastics and does motivational speaking. Kerri Strug, she of the inspirational vault, also lives in Washington.
Amanda Borden owns a gym in Tempe; Jaycie Phelps owns one in Indianapolis. Amy Chow is a doctor living in California. Beam Queen Shannon Miller became the president of Shannon Miller Lifestyle, and recovered from ovarian cancer in 2011.
And if you haven’t read this story about Dominique Moceanu, you must. Years after the 1996 Olympics, Moceanu learned she had a long-lost sister, Jennifer Bricker, who was born with no legs but who became a power tumbler, winning able-bodied gymnastics competitions throughout high school.
Ed. — An early version of this post incorrectly identified Kim Zmeskal as a member of the 1996 team. She, as any gymnastics fan worth her salt knows, competed in the 1992 Olympics. By Monica Hesse

8:00 PMSo you want to know about Ann Romney and horsesAnn Romney with her horse, Super Hit, in a 2006 photo. (Terri Miller/Handout)
NBC just aired a spot on Rafalca, the 15-year-old Oldenburg mare partly owned by the Romneys, and his 53-year-old Brit rider, Jan Ebeling. Our colleague Ned Martel wrote about Ann Romney’s connection to dressage:
“Should she become first lady, Romney told Parade magazine last fall, she would certainly bring horses to the White House lawn. She even ‘slipped away’ on the day of the Michigan primary to ride, telling Fox News that ‘some people have lovers in every port. I have horses in every port.’”

7:50 PMApparently there will be skeet shooting tonight.It might interest you to know that “skeet shooting” was originally known as “inanimate bird shooting,” which sounds vaguely horrifying, so we applaud this change.
It might further interest you to know that shooters shoots “clay pigeons” (still horrifying; less horrifying than “inanimate birds.”), which can be purchased in Great Britain through companies like The Clay Pigeon Company. They sell seven different varieties of clay pigeons. We like the one called the “manual rabbit.”
The Telegraph has a very useful skeet shooting guide.

7:49 PMI would like to be a silver-haired silver medalistGood evening. It’s prime time, kids, which means the Olympics are on! Forget that the events happened hours and hours ago. Monica Hesse and I are eating Thai takeout and cookies, and drinking (Arnold Palmers) around the TV, pretending that the past hasn’t passed. Item No. 1 up for conversation: How can we get me a medal?
After seeing Dan Jansen finally win gold in speed-skating in 1994 — or maybe it was after blubbering through his Visa commercial two years ago — I decided that at some point in my life I would win an Olympic medal (and get a Visa endorsement contract). I am currently 28 years old, of average athletic means and untrained in any sport. What are my options as my youth continues to wane? Archery, shooting, curling? There’s a 71-year-old Japanese man ( Hiroshi Hoketsu) competing in equestrian this year, but horses scare me.
Monica informs me that we have a magic “Are you over the hill for Olympic sports?” calculator, which says that at 28 I would not be out-of-place in most summer events (except trampoline; sigh). But let’s say it takes me at least eight years of consistent training to make an Olympic team. At 36, according to our calculator, I could still be physiologically competitive in 13 of 30 events, including soccer, which is the only Olympic sport in which I participate regularly (albeit at a grossly amateur level). Soccer just ain’t gonna happen for me (bad back, bad knees, bad dribbling, bad shooting), but table tennis seems doable. Shall I go for that? Who wants to sponsor me? (Visa?) I need a nickname. King Pong? Paddleboy Wonder? Look for me on the medal stand in 2020 in Istanbul, Tokyo or Madrid. YOU READ IT HERE FIRST.

When Marouan Kechrid, a 5-foot-9 guard for Tunisia, sank a three-pointer from the top of the key with 3 minutes 23 seconds left in the second quarter, he cut the heavily favored U.S. men’s basketball team’s lead to just five points, 35-30. But the African champions went scoreless for the next three minutes and the U.S. seized control.
LeBron James provided a handful of highlights in the second quarter: he flew past 6-foot-9 Mohamed Hadidane for a one-handed slam with around six minutes left in the period, and later he tossed a no-look behind the back pass to a cutting Kevin Durant for the Americans’ final points of the half. Durant leads the U.S. team with nine points; Carmelo Anthony has seven.

5:46 PMTwitter apologizes for notifying NBC about journalist’s tweetIn a blog Post Tuesday, Twitter apologized for an employee in their partnership division notifying NBC of British correspondent Guy Adams’s tweet. Twitter also confirmed that the employee encouraged the television network to notify a separate division within the company that handles violations of the company’s policies and procedures.
Adams, a correspondent for the Independent, had his Twitter account suspended after tweeting out the e-mail address of Gary Zenkel, president of NBC Olympics and encouraging others to message Zenkel with their complaints about NBC’s coverage.

5:37 PMRogers/Dalhausser remain unbeaten in beach volleyballDefending gold medalists Todd Rogers and Phil Dalhausser struggled in their Pool B match Tuesday at Horse Guards Parade before prevailing over Pablo Herrera Allepuz and Adrian Gavira Collado of Spain, 19-21, 21-16, 15-13.
Rogers and Dalhausser seemed sluggish at times against the Spaniards, who were inventive and energetic throughout. The Americans built a 5-1 lead in the third set but Spain fought back and cut the U.S. lead to 6-5.
Both teams made some excellent saves. Rogers made a dig save in the third set and Dalhausser softly planted it just across and along the Spanish side of the net for a 10-6 lead.
Rogers and Dalhausser face Premvsi Kubala and Petr Benes of the Czech Republic on Thursday in the final match of pool play before the lucky loser and knockout games begin.
The Americans are 2-0 in Pool B; Herrera Allepuz and Gavira Collado are 1-1.

Tunisia, the African champion, is ranked 32nd in the world and has no NBA players on its roster; it lost its Olympic opener to Nigeria, 60-56.
The two countries have met only once before in men’s basketball, with the U.S. winning easily, 92-57, in the 2010 world championships in Istanbul. The Americans only led by six points at halftime of that game.

The Americans got into the tournament by upsetting Argentina at last year’s Pan American Games, 4-2, considered by many to be the biggest upset in women’s field hockey history.
Argentina, the second-ranked team in the world, and the United States are now both 1-1 in Group B.

Michael Phelps won his 19th medal, setting an all-time record for Olympic athletes, as the U.S. men claimed gold in the 4×200 freestyle relay with a time of 6:59.70. The first three swimmers — Ryan Lochte, Conor Dwyer and Ricky Berens — gave Phelps a substantial lead heading into the final leg, and he was able to easily hold off France (7:02.77) and China (7:06.30).
The previous record for all-time Olympic medals was 18, held by Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina. Phelps has 15 gold medals in his career.

Shiwen, 16, was so impressive in winning the 400 IM — she set a world record and her freestyle leg was faster than that of men’s gold medal winner Ryan Lochte — that she’s faced accusations that she’s using performance-enhancing drugs, despite not having flunked a drug test.

3:48 PMU.S. men's water polo wins second matchBehind strong defense and three goals apiece from Ryan Bailey and Peter Varellas, the U.S. men’s water polo team won its second match of the tournament, topping Romania 10-8 Tuesday.
In goal, Merrill Moses held Romania scoreless for a crucial 12-minute stretch, allowing the U.S. to score four straight goals and take a second-half lead that they would not give up. Adam Wright added two goals to help the Americans, and the United States’ defense allowed only three second-half goals.
The United States and Serbia are the only two of the six teams in Group B to win both their matches.
The Americans next play Thursday against Britain, which has dropped both its matches here, scoring a total of just 11 goals in the process.

Much has been made of the disappointing crowds at some of the early Olympic events as well as Britain’s indifference toward the men’s soccer competition, but there’s a big crowd at Wembley today to watch Britain’s women’s soccer team face Brazil. After the British took an early 1-0 lead, Paul Logothetis of the Associated Press tweeted, “Wow, what a roar as 57,146 fans at #Wembley come to feet after #ENG scores after just 90 seconds vs #BRA!” And longtime Sports Illustrated soccer scribe Grant Wahl remarked, “Cool to see Wembley nearly full for women’s soccer” and passed along this picture.
UPDATE: The official attendance at Wembley was actually 70,584.

Chad le Clos of South Africa won the men’s 200 butterfly, out-touching Michael Phelps of the United States at the very end. Phelps, who owns both the world and Olympic record in this event, led for almost the entire race but took silver for his 18th medal all-time, tying the all-time Olympic record previously held by Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina.
Le Clos’s time was 1 minute 52.96 seconds, .05 of a second better than Phelps. Takeshi Matsuda of Japan won bronze.
“It’s been a dream of mine ever since I was a little boy,” Le Clos said. “I just wanted to race Phelps in a final, and I’ve beaten him. I can’t believe it. To beat him, I can’t believe it. You don’t understand what this means to me. This is the greatest moment of my life.”

2:42 PMJapan plays for draw in women's soccer, avoids U.S.Japan's players walk onto the pitch for the start of their game against South Africa. (GLYN KIRK/AFP/Getty Images)
Japan’s women’s soccer team tied South Africa, 0-0, in the final Group F opening round game — a somewhat surprising result considering that the Japanese are the World Cup champions and the South Africans were outscored 7-1 in losses to Sweden and Canada.
After the game, however, Japan Coach Norio Sasaki said that was the result his team was playing for in order to avoid traveling to Scotland for the knockout round of the tournament.
According to this Associated Press story,
Sasaki said he made tactical substitutions in the second half and gave the players instructions to keep possession rather than trying to attack, based on how the other match in Group F was going. In that match, Canada drew 2-2 with Sweden, meaning Sweden topped the group.
As a result, Japan, the second-place team in Group F, will play either Britain or Brazil in Cardiff on Friday. If Japan had won its group, it would have faced either the U.S., which it beat in the 2011 World Cup final, or France, a World Cup semifinalist, in Glasgow in the first elimination game on Friday.
“It was the coach’s instruction that we wanted to stay in Cardiff and come second in the group, so I knew that the bench were getting information about the other match and I had been told,” defender Azusa Iwashimizu told reporters after the game, according to a quote sheet. “So it was difficult to play, but I understood his idea because it is something we needed to do in order to get a medal.”

2:13 PMMissy Franklin's parents ponder daughter's futureWill Missy Franklin turn pro after these Games? (David J. Phillip -- Associated Press)
When three sponsors came after Missy Franklin at age 15, it seemed too soon to think about turning pro, her mother said Tuesday. Even when she won $70,000 in three days on the world cup circuit last fall but was unable to claim the money because of her amateur status, her parents did not bat an eye.
But after these Olympics, things could change.
The family will reconsider the issue of turning professional, which would mean she could attend college but not compete for her collegiate team, according to D.A. and Dick Franklin. The couple met with reporters outside the Aquatic Center before the evening’s Olympic swimming event.
This fall, Franklin, 17, will be a senior at Regis Jesuit High in Aurora, Colo.
“Our advice is going to be taking a look at all of the options and considering what it all means,” Franklin said. “She is going to college, but the point is does she swim on her college team and compete with them or is she going to practice with them and have the coach as her coach?
“I don’t know how [the Olympics] changes things. I don’t know who wants her, what they want her for and what she would get. It’s all unfamiliar territory.”
Said Dick Franklin: “All things being the same, she will go to college and swim in college. But none of us is naive enough to think if something really silly happens there’s not a financial consideration — but it would have to be pretty silly.”
On Monday, Franklin claimed an Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter backstroke. On Saturday, she got a bronze in the 4×100 relay. Tuesday, she has a chance for another medal in the 200 freestyle and she could win seven here.
D.A. Franklin also said that the family had some connections to the shooting victims in the recent movie theater attacks in Aurora, but had never been to the theater and did not directly know any victims.

1:48 PMVince Hancock comes close to perfection in skeet shootingVince Hancock reacts after competing in the men's skeet shooting final round. (Lars Baron/Getty Images)
For Vince Hancock, the reward is gold, but that’s not necessarily the goal. The skilled shooter aims much higher: for perfection.
He came pretty close to that Tuesday, hitting 148 out of 150 targets in the men’s skeet competition, becoming the first Olympian to win back-to-back gold medals in the event. Still, 150 would’ve been nice, he said.
“All I know is I want to be perfect every time,” Hancock said. “It’s just something inside of me. I’m a competitor through and through. … My wife gets onto me all the time. Even if we’re playing tic-tac-toe, I will get competitive about it.”
Hancock broke his own Olympic record by hitting 123 of 125 targets in qualifying. He shot all 25 in the finals.
“I try to better myself every single time,” Hancock said. “I think that’s where the perfectionism comes into play. In my sport, you almost have to be perfect in order to win a medal. Over the last three years, the score that I shot today wouldn’t have won a gold medal.”
Hancock is only 23 years old and says he hopes to compete for the U.S. team at least through the 2020 Games.
“I have every expectation of coming back and doing better every single time,” he said. “I can already tell you, if you ask me again in four years what you expect to shoot, I’m going to tell you 125 out of 125. That’s just how it goes.”

The U.S. men’s volleyball team won its second consecutive match in straight sets, 25-23, 25-16, 25-20, over Germany on Tuesday at Earls Court, and needs one more win to clinch a spot in the quarterfinals.
The Germans made the third set close at the end, forcing six match points before the United States, defending gold medalist, put the game away.
Clay Stanley had 16 points won and four digs for the Americans, who are 2-0 in Pool B play but face more daunting opponents in Brazil and Russia in their next two games. Their match against Brazil is Thursday at 3 p.m. ET.
“It’s a long tournament, it’s a grind,” captain Richard Lambourne said. “You have to take it one game at a time. It’s a cliche but it’s true in this case.”
The U.S. team is far more experienced than the Germans — the average age of the American starters Tuesday was 32, compared with 26 for the Germans. The oldest starter for the U.S. team is Lambourne; the oldest member of the German squad is 31.

1:24 PMU.S. women's gymnasts win gold medalGabby Douglas on the uneven bars. (Ronald Martinez -- Getty Images)
The U.S. women’s gymnastics team won its first Olympic team gold medal since 1996 and only its second in history at the London Games, as Russia, its closest competitor, imploded on its final event.
With it, this group of American women — some are already hailing them as the Fab Five — takes its place alongside the Magnificent Seven, who won the prestigious team gold at the 1996 Atlanta Games, thanks in large part to a gutsy vault by the injured Kerri Strug.
But in similar fashion, this year’s U.S. women’s gymnastics team didn’t lack for heroines.
The United States was helped throughout by a courageous performances from Gabby Douglas of Virginia Beach and a solid, selfless showing by Michigan’s Jordyn Wieber, who shook off her heartache over missing the finals for the all-around title two days earlier to deliver key scores on vault, uneven bars and floor.
The women’s triumph was a welcome boon for U.S. gymnastics following the sub-par showing by the U.S. men, who had been favored to win gold in Monday’s team competition but stumbled their way to a fifth.
The U.S. women seized the lead after the first of four mandatory events at London’s North Greenwich Arena, delivering three spectacular Amanar vaults. And they never relinquished it, acquitting themselves on the weakest event, the uneven bars, doing well on the beam and electrifying the crowd on the floor.
That was Russia’s undoing, with two of its three gymnasts falling during tumbling sequences and breaking down in tears. Russia’s gaffes took tremendous pressure off the Americans entering their final rotation, needing only 40.300 points — or a score of 13.500 each — to clinch gold.
And in turn, Douglas, Wieber and Aly Raisman delivered far more. And chants of “USA! USA!” rang out as the gymnasts jumped and huddled in a circle waiting for the scores that confirmed the obvious.
China, the defending Olympic champion, finished out of the medals, overtaken by Romania.

12:58 PMU.S. women's gymnasts maintain leadThere’s a bit of a retro feel to this women’s team gymnastics championship, which is shaking out as a battle between the United States and Russia.
After three events, the U.S. women still hold the lead (138.230 points) over Russia (136.931), with China a distant third (130.164).
Britain, whose men stunned the host nation by claiming the bronze team medal Monday, is solidly out of medal contention in the women’s event.
The Americans were still out front, with Russia overtaking China for second, when they moved to the balance beam to compete on their third of four events. But a solid, yet unspectacular showing on the beam, left them vulnerable to being overtaken. Gaffes by Russia on the beam worked in the Americans’ favor.
Kyla Ross got the U.S. started with 15.133. Up next, Gabby Douglas delivered a more daring routine that included a backflip with a twist, a full layout flip and a double flip in a tuck position for her dismount. She took one step on landing and had only a minor balance check during the routine. Judges gave it a 15.233.
Aly Raisman, competing in her first event of the day, didn’t deliver her best beam performance. Her leaps were conservative. She had one glaring wobble and finished with a major step out on her dismount to earn 14.933.
Still, no American fell off the beam or took a spill on her dismount and now move to their last event, the floor.

The U.S. struggled at the service line with seven errors – including two on game point – and the offense had difficulty connecting in the middle of its attack where it committed three unforced errors.
But facing a set point for the Germans, Anderson and David Lee combined for a critical point block to regain serve.

12:32 PMU.S. maintains lead midway through team finalGabby Douglas competes on the uneven bars during the team final. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)
We’ve already reached the halfway point of the team finals, and the U.S. women, who just finished competing on the uneven bars, are still out front, followed by Russia and China.
Bars are the American women’s weakest event, and they didn’t dazzle but they didn’t have any major glitches, either. And China, which could have gained considerable ground, had two obvious balance checks on beam.
The Americans bolted to an impressive lead after the first rotation, in which they flaunted three impressive Amanars to take a 1.733 point lead over China. Russia was third at that stage, handicapped by a poor landing by its best vaulter, Maria Paseka, which appeared to earn a scowl from the Russian star Victoria Komova.
After having to wait through two sessions, the American resumed the competition on the uneven bars. And chants of “USA!” “USA!” broke out as Jordyn Wieber, tapped once again to go first, stepped up to the apparatus.
Wieber’s routine was solid and clean, earning 14.666.
Then came Kyla Ross, of Aliso Viejo, Calif., who moved gracefully between the bars and closed with a double flipping dismount in layout position. She scored slightly higher, 14.933.
Gabby Douglas closed with a 15.200.
The Americans now face a quick turnaround, due up immediately on the balance beam. Tapped for duty: Kyla Ross, Gabrielle Douglas and Aly Raisman, who’ll be competing in her first event of the competition.

12:21 PMU.S. women's soccer underway vs. N. KoreaThe American women are back on the pitch for their third and final Group G match against North Korea at Old Trafford.
The two sides met last summer at the World Cup and the U.S. won that match 2-0. Afterward, the North Korea coach claimed multiple players on his team had been struck by lightning during training.

11:52 AMU.S. women's gymnasts off to terrific startThe U.S. didn’t waste time putting Jordyn Wieber’s emotional state to the test when the Olympic gymnastics team competition got under way here at North Greenwich Arena.

The U.S. women, who are favored to win their first team gold since 1996 and only their second in Olympic history, opened the competition on vault. And Wieber was first up, performing what’s considered the world’s most difficult vault, the Amanar, just two days after she was shut out of a chance to compete for the all-around title.
The Americans’ strongest and steadiest all-around performer the last two years, Wieber was only the third best American during Sunday’s qualifying, missing the cut, and left the arena in tears.
But roughly eight hours before the all-important team final began this afternoon, she tweeted: “TEAM FINALS TODAY! Really feeling the USA spirit, and we are ready to go!!!”
The vault is among the Americans’ better events, and Wieber got them off to a terrific start, earning 15.933.
Up next was Gabby Douglas of Virginia Beach, who’ll compete for the all-around crown, along with Aly Raisman. Douglas got a bit more amplitude on her Amanar and managed 15.966.
And McKayla Maroney delivered the best Amanar of all, delivering a compact two-and-a-half flips, impressive height and a nicely stuck landing. She earned 16.233 points and was smothered in hugs by her coach and teammates.
The U.S women couldn’t be off to a better start and ought to be in first place once all eight teams complete the first rotation.

Stevens had only 35 minutes to regroup after devastating semifinal loss to defending gold medalist Ole Bischof of Germany before returning to the mat to face the second repechage winner.
But after exhausting tremendous energy in his scoreless bout with Bischof, the three-time national champion simply ran out of gas. Valois-Fortier won the match 11-0 and when the clock ran out Stevens crumpled to the mat in despair.
U.S. men judokas have won only two medals – both bronze – in the last five Olympics.

11:29 AMDjokovic makes quick work of Roddick Novak Djokovic had little problem dispatching Andy Roddick. (Luis Acosta -- AFP/Getty Images)
Serbia’s Novak Djokovic, the former world No. 1 who lost that status only earlier this month to Roger Federer, looked impressive in easily dispatching American Andy Roddick in the second round of the Olympic tennis tournament Tuesday afternoon at the All England club. The 6-2, 6-1 victory took all of 54 minutes.
In what amounted to the marquee match of the day on Centre Court — which was covered by a roof as slight showers suspended play on outer courts — Roddick trailed early and never recovered. Serving to stay in the first set, he hit a fine forehand that Djokovic returned off the net. It dropped for the point that broke Roddick and handed the first set to Djokovic.
Roddick, a three-time Wimbledon finalist who played one of the epic matches in the history of Centre Court — a five-set loss to Federer in the 2008 final — did not participate in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. He came here unseeded, and was a huge underdog against Djokovic.
Djokovic immediately went up a break in the second set, using a deft drop shot to secure the second game. Though Roddick enjoyed significant crowd support, Djokovic all but toyed with him, showing both power and touch. He landed a deft volley to force match point, almost crippling Roddick, and then served out the match with an ace. Roddick left the court with his head down, though he acknowledged the cheers by waving.

11:21 AMWimbledon historian John Barrett weighs inJohn Barrett, the former English player, commentator, and author, has attended almost every Wimbledon championship — playing in 18 singles tournaments. He got to the third round four times, losing to such luminaries as Ken Rosewall, the Australian whose backhand was legendary.
Britain’s former Davis Cup captain, he originally wrote “100 Wimbledon Championships” in 1986 and has followed up with several more editions. He was currently updating the book through the Olympics when I caught up with him at the All England Lawn and Tennis Club this afternoon.
With all due respect to the Federer-Djokovic and Federer-Nadal recent showdowns, his most memorable men’s singles championship was Borg-McEnroe in 1980, the iconic match won by Borg that was decided with an 18-16 tiebreak in the fifth set.
“Before that, [Britain's] Virginia Wade winning the women’s championship in the Queen’s Jubilee year of 1977,” Barrett said. “What a special time for everyone that was.”
Barrett trivia: “I ran against Roger Bannister in high school. We were 17 or 18 years old. Yes, the mile. I know you will find this shocking, but I did not win.”

11:08 AMChinese win another diving goldAnother day, another diving gold for the Chinese team.
China swept the diving gold medals in Beijing four years ago, and the country seems to be on track to repeat that performance. Tuesday at the Aquatics Centre, Ruolin Chen and Hao Wang took gold in the women’s 10-meter synchronized platform even with a score of 368.40.
That score easily bested Alejandra Orozco Loza and Paola Espinosa Sanchez of Mexico (343.32), who took silver, and Canadians Meaghan Benfeito and Roseline Filion, who won bronze (337.62).
The United States did not have a team in the field of eight.

11:04 AMU.S. women's gymnastics team favored Jordyn Wieber will have to overcome her individual disappointment to help the U.S. women win team gymnastics gold. (Brian Snyder -- Reuters)
If the U.S. women’s gymnasts compete as well as they’re capable, they should leave North Greenwich Arena on Tuesday as only the second U.S. women’s gymnastics team to win the coveted team gold.
With it, the Fab Five would take its place alongside the Magnificent Seven of the 1996 Atlanta Games.
But that’s hardly a given, as the American men demonstrated in stumbling their way to a fifth-place finish, hopelessly out of medal contention after just three of their six mandatory events.
While each of the U.S. team’s five gymnasts will have a role in today’s team competition, Jordyn Wieber will likely decide the team’s fate.
Wieber, the reigning world all-around champion, had her lifetime dreams crushed on this same gym floor in Sunday’s qualifications. She finished third among Americans and fourth among all of the world’s elite gymnasts who were vying for the right to contend for the individual all-around title. But because each country is limited to two candidates, being the third-best Americans on the day was the same as being last.
It was devastating, and Wieber, who until that point had failed to win only one individual competition in the last two years (edged by teammate Gabby Douglas in U.S. Olympic trials in July), left the arena in tears.
Nonetheless, her performance was instrumental in the U.S. women finishing first in qualifications (Russia was a close second, China a distant third), which makes the Americans the gold medal favorite today.
So it’s critical that Wieber, 17, set aside any personal anguish over getting eclipsed by Douglas and Aly Raisman on Sunday, and be her rock-solid normal self today. Wieber has been tapped to compete in three of the four mandatory events.
Russia is expected to challenge the Americans for gold. Defending Olympic champion China, as well as perennial contender Romania, are also formidable.
To recap the team competition format: Eight countries compete. Each selects three gymnasts to compete on the four mandatory apparatus: floor, balance beam, vault and uneven bars. Because all three gymnasts’ scores count, no one can falter. A blunder by one spoils the medal prospects of the team.
Here’s the lineup the U.S. will field today, with the gymnast deemed strongest on each apparatus competing last:
Vault: Jordyn Wieber, Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney.
Uneven bars: Wieber, Kyla Ross, Douglas
Balance beam: Ross, Douglas, Raisman
Floor exercise: Douglas, Wieber, Raisman.

10:53 AMHerring loses in light welterweight boutKazakhstan’s Daniyar Yeleussinov had no problem with American Jamel Herring, earning a decisive 19-9 win Tuesday in a light welterweight bout. Herring, a 26-year-old electrician with the U.S. Marines who’s been deployed twice to Iraq, saw his bid for Olympic glory end in the round of 32 here at the London Games.
Herring was outskilled from the opening bell and trailed 8-5 after the first round. With a 7-3 second round, Yeleussinov held a seven-point advantage heading into the third round and was able to switch to a more conservative style.
Trailing 15-8, Herring struggled to chase Yeleussinov around the ring, scoring just one point in the final round.

10:36 AMRail costs Swede gold in eventingSara Algotsson Ostholt was oh-so-close to eventing gold. (Cameron Spencer -- Getty Images)
Michael Jung of Germany won the gold medal in individual eventing with a second clean ride around the show jumping course in Greenwich Park Tuesday, just a few hours after the Germans also claimed team gold in eventing.
Jung rode next-to-last and finished with a score of 40.60. Sara Algotsson Ostholt of Sweden had a chance to be the first woman to win gold in individual eventing. She rode last, with a score of 39.30, and needed a clean ride to edge Jung.
It seemed she had it, but her horse Wega’s hoof clipped the final rail and after she cleared it, it wobbled and then fell, to the dismay of the Swedes and the delight of the Germans.
Germany’s Saundra Auffarth, aboard Opgun Louvo, won the bronze.
Karen O’Connor of The Plains had a second perfect ride about Mr. Medicott and finished ninth, best among the American team. O’Connor is a two-time eventing medalist in the team event and the oldest Olympian on the U.S. team at 54.

10:34 AMTravis Stevens falls in judo semifinalsTravis Stevens (left) matched Ole Bischof on the scoreboard but lost the judges' decision. (Franck Fifefranck/Getty Images)
Travis Stevens‘s bid to become the first American to win Olympic gold in judo is over despite a scoreless semifinal bout with defending gold medalist German Ole Bischof.
Stevens, fighting with heavy tape over the left side of his face, kept Bischof off the board through three rounds of their men’s 81 kg match and into the golden score period. But when the clock ran out, a judges decision awarded the victory to the German.
The 26-year-old Stevens crumpled to the mat and was inconsolable after the decision. Bischof ousted Stevens from the main competition in the 2008 Beijing Games.
Stevens will now face Canadian Antoine Valois-Fortier – one of two repechage contest winners – for one of the two bronze medals.

Kerri Walsh Jennings, who with Misty May-Treanor has won two straight Olympic beach volleyball gold medals, is fighting a brave battle against pinkeye. She will soldier on, the Associated Press reports.
“Walsh Jennings’ left eye was red and watery and she was squinting Tuesday at a meet-and-greet arranged by the international governing body of beach volleyball. She is taking antibiotics,” the AP said.
The beach volleyball dynamos have won their first two matches at these Games and are almost a lock to advance to the knockout round.

10:09 AMO'Connor perfect in final jumping roundKaren O’Connor had a second perfect ride over the show jumping course Tuesday and was briefly atop the standings for the individual eventing title.
O’Connor, of The Plains, Va., and the U.S. team’s oldest competitor at 54. Her earlier ride in the jumping portion of the team eventing competition was also perfect, but the Americans finished seventh.
The top 25 individual scores from team eventing take one more turn around the jumping course to determine the individual medals. O’Connor is unlikely to medal but a penalty-free round will boost her up the final list.
She was followed by Zara Phillips, granddaughter of the Queen, whose British team won silver in the team event.

Scotsman Andy Murray, representing Britain at his home Olympic Games, easily advanced to the third round of the men’s tennis tournament with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Finland’s Jarrko Nieminen that took just 61 minutes Tuesday afternoon at the All England club.
Murray, who lost a stirring Wimbledon final to Roger Federer on this very same surface earlier this month, was not tested by Nieminen in the straight-set victory in front of a partisan crowd. With the roof over Centre Court closed after rain delayed several matches slated for outside courts, Murray took an early first-set lead and never relented. He played a wonderful backhand volley to force match point, then finished Nieminen with an ace.
Murray will be followed on Centre Court by unseeded Andy Roddick of the U.S. against second-seeded Novak Djokovic of Serbia.

9:38 AMSerena Williams won't play mixed doublesSerena Williams will play doubles with sister Venus, but not mixed doubles. (Clive Brunskill -- Getty Images)
Serena Williams had professed a desire to play mixed doubles, which is returning to the Olympics for the first time since 1924. But when the U.S. teams were released Tuesday, she wasn’t among those slated to compete.
“We’ve already had rain delays, and we already have a ton of matches ahead of us in just a few days,” said Serena’s sister Venus, with whom she’ll play in the regular doubles tournament. “So I think it was better for us to focus on these two events.”
Serena Williams is a five-time Wimbledon champ, but she has never won an individual gold at the Olympics. She and Venus have twice won the Olympic doubles tournament.
The Bryan brothers — who make up the world’s best doubles team — will thus pair with Lisa Raymond and Leizel Huber. Mike Bryan will pair with Raymond, with whom he won the Wimbledon title earlier this month. Bob Bryan will play with Huber, reuniting a team that has won two Grand Slam championships.
“What’s most important is bringing home medals for the U.S.,” Venus Williams said, “so it was important to let them kind of bring home some medals for us.”
“What’s most important is bringing home medals for the U.S. so it was important to let them kind of bring home some medals for us.”
Meanwhile, with rain coming down at Wimbledon, the roof closed over Centre Court before Great Britain’s Andy Murray took the first set against Finland’s Jarkko Nieminen, 6-2.

8:59 AMChina scolds Ye Shiwen's doubtersYe Shiwen won gold after a stunning world-record time in the 400 IM Saturday (David Gray -- Reuters)
One day after John Leonard, executive director of the World Swimming Coaches Association, questioned the legitimacy of Ye Shiwen’s world-record performance in the 400-meter individual medley, China’s anti-doping chief has fired back.
“I think it is not proper to single Chinese swimmers out once they produce good results. Some people are just biased,” Jiang Zhixue told the state news agency Xinhua, according to the Guardian. “We never questioned Michael Phelps when he bagged eight gold medals in Beijing.”
Earlier in the Guardian, Leonard had called Ye’s performance Saturday in the 400 IM “unbelievable,” “suspicious” and “disturbing.” Ye’s final lap was quicker than U.S. male swimmer Ryan Lochte’s in the 400-meter individual medley, and her overall time was seven seconds faster than her previous best.

McLean, 24, who finished fifth in the 200 final at the U.S. Olympic trials, swam the second leg as the United States won its heat and topped all qualifiers in 7 minutes 6.75 seconds. McLean swam his leg in 1:46.68, handing off to Davis Tarwater (1:46.33) and Conor Dwyer (1:45.52).
McLean is unlikely to swim on a final squad that will include Michael Phelps, who will be seeking to become the most decorated Olympian of all-time in the race, and Ryan Lochte, but he will claim any medal the team wins for swimming in the morning.

8:20 AMVenus Williams easily moves onFive-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams, playing on the stage where she has enjoyed the best moments of her career, crushed an overwhelmed Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak in the second round of the Olympic tennis tournament Tuesday afternoon, needing only 66 minutes to take a 6-1, 6-3 victory.
Williams, who is unseeded in this tournament and has struggled because of an autoimmune disease that causes fatigue, looked strong through the first 11 games, then appeared to tire a bit. She staved off two break points in the first game of the second set, and by the time Wozniak finally broke her in the fifth game, she was up 4-0. Wozniak broke Williams again in the seventh game of the set, when Williams was serving for the match.
Williams won the final game at love, and finished things off with an ace. She then celebrated with her familiar fans, waving to the crowd. Williams will face Angelique Kerber of Germany in the third round.
Because rain delayed her opening match on an outlying court, and because she is playing doubles with her sister Serena — whose hair spilled from under a white baseball cap as she looked on from the family box with their mother, Oracene — Venus Williams could play six straight days if she keeps advancing.

Dutton had 23 penalties, giving him 70.1 overall, and that ended any slim hopes the Americans had of moving into the top three. The U.S. team needed a strong ride from Dutton after losing Boyd Martin, who withdrew his horse. The two lowest scores among the five riders are dropped, so Martin’s withdrawal left less room for error. The Americans dropped to seventh.

Saudi Arabia sent female athletes to the Games for the first time this year, on the condition that they adhere to the nation’s Islamic traditions, headscarf included. But judo officials worry that such a covering could be dangerous in a sport that involves so many grabs and holds.
IOC spokesman Mark Adams said Tuesday that an agreement had been reached that is “safety compliant but also allows for cultural sensitivity.”

7:35 AMBig tennis names on court TuesdayVenus and Serena Williams will be back on the court for doubles later Tuesday morning. (Elise Amendola -- Associated Press)
Venus Williams took to a familiar spot just after noon here, ambling onto Centre Court at the All England club for her second-round match in the women’s singles tournament against Canada’s Aleksandra Wozniak.
The five-time Wimbledon champion and 2000 Olympic gold medalist opened the match by breaking Wozniak three times in the first set, which she won easily, 6-1.
Williams’s match begins a busy day for her — she’ll pair with sister Serena later this afternoon in the doubles competition — and for fans at Centre Court. Great Britain’s Andy Murray, the Scot who solidified his status as a national hero with a gallant charge to the Wimbledon final earlier this month, will face Finland’s Jarkko Nieminen next.
Perhaps the most interesting match of the day follows, with former world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, the 2011 Wimbledon champ and 2008 Olympic bronze medalist from Serbia, will face unseeded American Andy Roddick, a three-time Wimbledon finalist.

The U.S. eventing team may be a medal long shot, especially after Boyd Martin had to withdraw his horse after the cross-country event, but Karen O’Connor did her part Tuesday morning at Greenwich Park, turning in a clean ride in the final stage of the three-day eventing competition.
O’Connor, of The Plains, Va., finished under time and with no penalties, leaving her with a score of 53.8 (the total of her penalties in the three phases of the event — dressage, cross-country and jumping).
Scores count toward the team competition as well as the individual competition, and while the Americans probably can’t make a move into the top three, O’Connor, who was in 24th going into the jumping, helped her case in the individual eventing.
O’Connor is riding Mr. Medicott, a horse purchased from the German team. She is a two-time Olympic medalist.
Earlier, Zara Phillips of Britain — granddaughter of the Queen, daughter of Princess Anne, and cousin to pretty much every royal in the country — had a solid ride aboard High Kingdom, although she took down one rail. Britain should win a medal in the team event.
