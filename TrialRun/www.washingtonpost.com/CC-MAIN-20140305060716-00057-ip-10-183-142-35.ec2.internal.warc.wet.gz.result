Jayson Werth breaks left wrist, could be out months
By James Wagner
Jayson Werth broke his left wrist while making a sliding catch in the sixth inning and will likely be out, Manager Davey Johnson said, for a few months, dealing the Nationals another blow to their already injured roster.
Werth, the Nationals everyday right field who was enjoying a solid season so far, suffered a “clean break” of the wrist, Johnson said. Werth, whose career was almost derailed in 2005 he was hit by a pitch on the same wrist, will consult the same specialist who helped him recover from that injury to see where any ligaments were damaged or if there were further complications, a team spokesman said.
“We seem to be getting more healthy and boom, another one of our main guys goes down,” Johnson said. “We’ve dealt with it before. We’ll deal with it again. We’re not alone.”

field when his glove hand slammed into the ground and bent back. He immediately fell to the ground and grabbed his left wrist, holding it all the way into the clubhouse.
After the game, the clubhouse was almost silent, more so than normal after losses.
“It’s a sad, sad thing for him,” Jordan Zimmermann said. “He’s one of our leaders and now he’s going to be gone for a few months.”
Added Adam LaRoche: “It’s never a good time for anybody, especially a guy in the heart of the lineup.”

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
The Post’s View
Where is Vincent Gray’s leadership?
By Editorial Board, THE QUESTION put to D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) was simple: Did he know, before or during the 2010 Democratic mayoral primary, about a secret, well-funded and illegal “shadow campaign” on his behalf?
“We ran a campaign based on the laws and principles of the District of Columbia,” the mayor replied during an appearance Friday on Bruce DePuyt’s “NewsTalk” on NewsChannel 8. That Mr. Gray would go on television, refuse to answer that basic question and then make the incredible claim of having run a campaign in keeping with accepted standards speaks volumes about his arrogant belief that, short of being hauled away in handcuffs, he owes the public no accounting for his actions. Washington Post Editorials
Editorials represent the views of The Washington Post as an institution, as determined through debate among members of the editorial board. News reporters and editors never contribute to editorial board discussions, and editorial board members don’t have any role in news coverage.

A stand for nothing
Editorial Board An impasse in Richmond over expanded health insurance for the poor is driven by ideology, not facts.
Apply the brakes
Editorial Board The Secret Service needs to avoid so many main road closures.
Set aside for the moment whether Mr. Gray was aware of the $653,000 unlawfully used to purchase materials and hire workers to secure his victory over then-Mayor Adrian M. Fenty two years ago — money allegedly supplied by a prominent businessman with significant contractual interests with the D.C. government. It is evident that the official Gray-for-mayor campaign — the one that Mr. Gray proudly proclaimed to be “based on laws and principles” — had its own myriad troubles. A campaign official responsible for day-to-day finances conspired with a consultant to illegally divert Gray campaign funds in a slimy scheme that enabled a fringe mayoral candidate to continue his attacks on Mr. Fenty, Mr. Gray’s main opponent. The two men, Thomas W. Gore, longtime friend to Mr. Gray, and Howard Brooks, close friend to Mr. Gray’s campaign chairwoman, each pleaded guilty to federal felony charges and are awaiting sentencing.On Friday, the same day Mr. Gray was using words such as integrity to defend the kind of campaign he set out to run, The Post’s Nikita Stewart detailed how $100,000 in cash supposedly used for “polling/mailing lists” was actually doled out to campaign field workers. Campaign Treasurer Betty Brown admitted it to Ms. Stewart. Moreover, according to an investigation by the Associated Press, those day laborers were routinely being paid twice the legal limit in cash. It’s not the first time Mr. Gray’s campaign ran afoul of the rules about cash. Previous reporting by Ms. Stewart revealed that the campaign collected cash donations over the legal limit and unlawfully converted some of them into money orders. Mr. Gray’s excuses — that he was busy as D.C. Council chairman worrying about the city budget and that he did the best job he could of running a campaign in a short period — fall short. Leadership is about putting together a team to carry out your direction and accepting responsibility for the outcome. Perhaps the most maddening part of Mr. Gray’s latest interview came when Mr. DePuyt mentioned his campaign slogan of “character, integrity, leadership” and wondered if it was possible suspect monies paid for the literature bearing that message. Before saying that he hoped not, Mr. Gray actually chuckled, as if there is anything amusing about this unfolding scandal. The only time Mr. Gray was really forthcoming was in unloading on the council members — David I. Catania (I-At Large), Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) and Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4) — who have called for his resignation. Instead of impugning the motives of elected officials who are rightly troubled by how the democratic process was corrupted, Mr. Gray might acknowledge there is a higher bar for elected officials than not getting indicted. He has, as D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) put it, “an obligation to clear this matter up quickly.” More on this debate:

1. Colts—Andrew Luck, QB, Stanford
The Colts get their new franchise QB to replace Peyton Manning by taking the player believed to be the top pick all along. Paul Sakuma

2. Redskins—Robert Griffin III, QB, Baylor
The Redskins gave up plenty to move up to this spot so they could take Griffin. If he becomes a franchise QB, no one will care what they traded away.
Sharon Ellman

Associated Press
3. Vikings—Matt Kalil, T, USC
Minnesota gets an anchor for its offensive line—unless it can interest a team in trading up into this spot, perhaps to pick Ryan Tannehill, which would make three QBs in the first three picks.
Michael Conroy
/
Associated Press
4. Browns—Trent Richardson, RB, Alabama
Running backs aren’t as prized in today’s pass-happy NFL and the Browns could opt for Ryan Tannehill or WR Justin Blackmon. But Richardson seems likely to be a reliable, productive runner.
John Bazemore
/
Associated Press
5. Buccaneers—Morris Claiborne, CB, LSU
Bucs get the draft’s top cornerback.
Leslie Westbrook
/
Associated Press
6. Rams—Justin Blackmon, WR, Oklahoma State
Even after the big trade with the Redskins moves them down four spots, the Rams end up with a badly needed top receiving target for young QB Sam Bradford.

7. Jaguars—Fletcher Cox, DT, Mississippi State
Jacksonville gets the top available interior defensive lineman. South Carolina LB/DE Melvin Ingram also could be an option for the Jaguars.
Mark Humphrey
/
Associated Press
8. Dolphins—Ryan Tannehill, QB, Texas A&M
After trying but failing to land a top-tier QB in free agency, the Dolphins seemingly have to get Tannehill, even if it requires trading up to do so.
Darren Carroll

9. Panthers—Melvin Ingram, LB/DE, South Carolina
He might be the draft’s top pass rusher.
John Amis
/
Associated Press
10. Bills—Riley Reiff, T, Iowa
Buffalo gets the tackle thought to be the second-best available, after Matt Kalil.
Charlie Neibergall
/
Associated Press
11. Chiefs—Dontari Poe, DT, Memphis
Some in the league seem to think Poe could slip a bit down the first-round order but others regard him as a highly intriguing prospect.
Lance Murphey
/
Associated Press
12. Seahawks—Mark Barron, S, Alabama
Seattle gets a potential difference-maker in the secondary.
Keith Srakocic
/
Associated Press
13. Cardinals—Quinton Coples, DE, North Carolina
Some analysts say his play slipped a bit last season because of how he was used. He has the talent to be a top-10 pick.
Mel Evans
/
Associated Press
14. Cowboys—Stephon Gilmore, CB, South Carolina
Dallas has some needs in the secondary and could trade up to select Mark Barron.
Brett Flashnick
/
Associated Press
15. Eagles—Cordy Glenn, T, Georgia
The Eagles love to draft linemen.
Michael Conroy
/
Associated Press
16. Jets—Luke Kuechly, LB, Boston College
The Jets add a productive tackler at inside linebacker.
Rob Carr
/
Associated Press
17. Bengals—David DeCastro, G, Stanford
Cincinnati has a pair of first-round picks. With the first of them, the Bengals land the draft’s top interior offensive lineman.
Paul Sakuma
/
Associated Press
18. Chargers—Michael Floyd, WR, Notre Dame
San Diego made moves at WR in free agency after losing Vincent Jackson, but getting Floyd would give the Chargers a top-shelf receiver.
Toni L. Sandys

The Washington Post
19. Bears—Stephen Hill, WR, Georgia Tech
Chicago continues to fortify its receiver corps after trading for Brandon Marshall.
John Bazemore
/
Associated Press
20. Titans—Dre Kirkpatrick, CB, Alabama
Tennessee gets a possible replacement at cornerback for departed free agent Cortland Finnegan.
Dave Martin

Associated Press
21. Bengals—Michael Brockers, DT, LSU
Cincinnati adds to its defense with the second of its two first-round picks.

22. Browns—Courtney Upshaw, LB/DE, Alabama
Cleveland takes a pass rusher with the second of its two first-round selections.
Rogelio V. Solis

30. 49ers—Nick Perry, DE/LB, USC
The Niners get even better and deeper on defense.
Christine Cotter
/
Associated Press
31. Patriots—Chandler Jones, DE/LB, Syracuse
The Patriots, with their second first-round pick, acquire some help for their defense, if they're not able to trade down for more picks, that is.
Kevin Rivoli

Associated Press
32. Giants—Kevin Zeitler, G, Wisconsin
The champs opt for the guard thought to be the draft’s second-best, after David DeCastro.
