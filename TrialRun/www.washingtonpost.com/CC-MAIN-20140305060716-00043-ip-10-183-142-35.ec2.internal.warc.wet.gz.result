Obama and Romney on the economy — empathy or competence?
By Peyton M. Craighill
On trust to handle the No. 1 issue — the economy — public perceptions of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney diverge in important ways, particularly among independent voters.
Among all registered voters, the president is, by a wide margin, viewed as being more in tune with the economic problems people are having, while the top Republican challenger has a slight advantage on economic stewardship in a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.
Obama and Romney get a mix of reactions on a variety of other issues. Obama earns higher public trust when it comes to protecting the middle class, dealing with international affairs and battling terrorism. Romney’s holds the advantage as the candidate better able to deal with the budget deficit. The two are evenly matched on “creating jobs.”
If the election boils down to primarily the economy, each candidate will have a claim to that mantle. By 52 to 37 percent, more voters say that Obama “better understands the economic problems people in this country are having.”
Romney’s push back is his perceived strength in handling specific economic concerns. By 52 to 39 percent more voters trust him than Obama to handle the budget deficit. And Romney has a more narrow 50 to 44 percent edge on handling the economy among all voters.
Narrowing the scope to independents, the swing voters that can make or break elections, finds more advantages for Romney. A little more than half pick him for handling the deficit, the economy and creating jobs (albeit a more slight advantage over Obama on this count).
Obama’s big advantages on protecting the middle class and economic empathy among all voters shrink a bit among independent voters. Still, about half of independents pick Obama on these measures.

The Circuit: Cybersecurity, spectrum and privacy
By Hayley Tsukayama
Cybersecurity: The House subcommittee on communications and technology discussed cybersecurity on the Hill Wednesday, to examine threats to security networks with a focus on public sector response.
The hearing came as FBI executive assistant director Shawn Henry warned that the country is “not winning” its war against computer hackers in a report in The Wall Street Journal He said he has been frustrated by companies that do not appear to be taking cyber threats seriously.
On Tuesday, Reps. Mary Bono Mack (R-Calif.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) proposed a new piece of cybersecurity legislation that is aimed at improving communication between the public and private sectors on cybersecurity issues. The bill, called the SECURE IT Act, drew swift criticism from Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) who called it “misguided” for relying on private companies to propose voluntary safety standards.
NTIA spectrum report: On Tuesday, the Commerce Department released its report on spectrum, proposing that the U.S. government share, rather than auction, a specific band of airwaves with wireless providers who have complained that they are feeling a spectrum crunch.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration report said that a committee will work to find a way to share the 1755-1850 MHz band of spectrum “while maintaining essential federal capabilities and maximizing commercial utilization.”
“Spectrum is a finite resource in growing demand, and we need to focus on new ways to maximize its use,” said NTIA head Lawrence Strickling. “By working with the FCC, other federal agencies, and the industry, we can make more spectrum available to fuel innovation and preserve America’s technological leadership while protecting vital government missions.”
The report drew praise from wireless carriers, public interest groups and lawmakers, who said the proposal will help ease the strain on networks and make full use of the available spectrum.
Privacy hearing: The House subcommittee on trade will hold a hearing Thursday examining the effect of the White House’s proposal on privacy, asking “Does the President’s proposal tip the scale?”
Federal Trade Commission chairman John Leibowitz and NTIA head Lawrence Strickling will testify at the hearing, as will representatives from TechFreedom, the Online Publishers Associations, the Association for Competitive Technology, the Interactive Advertising Bureau and privacy expert Justin Brookman of the Center for Democracy and technology.
Google Europe: A European consumer group called for E.U. regulators to act against Google according to a report from The New York Times.
The European Consumers’ Organization wrote a letter to E.U. antitrust commission Joaquin Almunia alleging that Google “may have abused its position in the search market” to reap advantages for its own Web products, the report said.
House votes to pass FCC bill: The House voted to pass a bill that would limit the Federal Communication Commission’s authority to approve mergers and impose regulations on Tuesday afternoon, in a 274-174 vote.
On Monday, the White House came out against the bill, saying that it would unnecessarily hinder the agency.
The bill’s passage in the House drew praise from the telecom industry and criticism from public interest groups, but is unlikely to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Obama: Crimea vote unconstitutional
Silver lining for Sen. Gillibrand Furious backlash derails smart gun 40 Washington dishes you must try
Research in Motion still has a long road ahead of it
Berthold Stadler/AP - In this Nov. 8, 2011, file photo, a Blackberry employee holds a mobile phone of Blackberry in Berlin.
By Hayley Tsukayama, E-mail the writer
Research in Motion illustrated Thursday that its fate depends on the performance of its next operating system, BlackBerry 10. Investors made it clear they will have little patience with the company if it doesn’t live up to expectations.
RIM reported better than expected revenue, sending its stock up in after-hours trading. But comments from chief executive Thorsten Heins saying that the company was planning to eliminate service fees for some new customers sent the stock back down — and quickly. Ahead of the market’s open Friday, RIM shares were trading at $12.33 after closing at $14.12 on Thursday.

The smart gun controversy at Oak Tree Gun Club
Michael S. Rosenwald The Oak Tree Gun Club is enduring severe backlash for offering the nation’s first smart gun.
.
Michael S. Rosenwald After criticism from gun rights groups, the store renounced its association with the nation’s first smart gun.
Heins said that RIM will continue to charge the fee to those who want enhanced services, such as advanced security, but that consumers or businesses that don't want the extra services are expected to generate “less or no service revenue.”Service fees made up 36 percent of the company’s revenue in the third quarter, or nearly $9.8 million. It was the second-largest source of revenue for the company, after hardware.In an analyst note Thursday morning, Macquerie Securities analyst Kevin Smithen said he believes Heins’s comments were “taken slightly out of context.”“BB10 service pricing plans are currently being negotiated with carriers and customers, so even the company has limited visibility at this time,” Smithen said. Service fees in North America are likely to decline once consumers and businesses get their hands on new devices, he said. But Smithen said he believes that BlackBerry 7 customers overseas won’t be as eager to change their plans, and will “erode far less quickly” than in the United States and Canada. He also said that RIM may make up some North American losses by introducing management fees for customers with multiple devices, such as businesses.Investors are clearly nervous about RIM’s indication that it will tinker with such a large revenue source when it’s clear the new system’s performance will make or break the company. The smartphone maker also reported its first-ever loss in subscribers — from 80 million to 79 million in a quarter — saying that the expectation of its long-awaited BlackBerry 10 system was likely causing some to “defer purchasing decisions and wait” for the new devices. BlackBerry 10’s launch has been delayed for nearly two years.RIM is still projecting a loss for the fourth quarter as BlackBerry 10 gets on its feet, citing marketing and other costs.The company is preparing for the global debut of BlackBerry 10 on Jan. 30 and is already working with more than 150 carriers worldwide. It’s also focusing on maintaining and growing its core government and business customers ahead of the launch. In addition to receiving government security certification last month, the company also said it’s testing the business version of the system in 64 Fortune 500 companies.
