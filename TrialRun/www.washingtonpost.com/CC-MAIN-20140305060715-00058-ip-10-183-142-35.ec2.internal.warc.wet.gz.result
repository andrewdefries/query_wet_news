A powerful term in U.S. high schools: DBQ
By Jay Mathews
You may not know what a DBQ is. For most of my life, neither did I. But in the high schools of this region and the rest of the country it has become an important and in some ways fearsome term. It haunts the dreams of 400,000 teenagers who will take the Advanced Placement exam in U.S. history Wednesday. It is part of a massive reform of the AP exam system that controls the schedules of most of the nation’s high schools every May. DBQ is an acronym for “document-based question.” Multiple-choice questions make up 55 minutes of the 3-hour, 5-minute AP U.S. History exam, which has the second-largest number of AP test-takers, behind only the English Language and Composition exam. The rest of the time is devoted to two essay questions and the DBQ, an essay based on roughly 10 short historical documents or quotes. The DBQ counts more than any other question on the exam. It draws by far the most attention, including pre-exam guessing of what it will be about.
Is DBQ mania good for our schools? Philip W. Engle Jr., a history teacher at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, has been educating me on this. He has been an AP teacher for 20 years. He doesn’t think DBQs are bad. They “require students to work with documents and use higher-level thinking skills to use this information to defend a thesis,” Engle said. “This is a great skill to have, especially when writing research papers.”
But to Engle, the DBQ seems at odds with the view of the College Board — and most universities — that AP U.S. History is a college-level course. The DBQ “is a unique writing task and one they will never do in college,” Engle said. “In my four years as a history major and in pursuing my master’s degree in history, never did I write a single DBQ essay. They are not college assignments.”
That may be changing. The Collegiate Learning Assessment, a key part of a movement to assess how much students learn in college, is essentially one long DBQ. Students receive letters, news clippings and government reports, then they are asked to do some real-world analysis, like telling a corporate board whether to buy a company plane. John Williamson, a former Kentucky school district superintendent who is executive director for AP curriculum and content development, said Engle is correct that college professors don’t assign DBQs, but they seem to be requiring something similar. He did a search of college U.S. history course syllabi and found that in most cases, “students were asked to read multiple primary sources and then develop a thesis or respond to a question that required the synthesis of several primary sources.”
Engle has no problem with the growth of DBQs. But like many AP teachers, he thinks the mystery surrounding what will be on the DBQ and the rest of the history exam hurts learning.
“The AP test can ask anything from economic trends, political history, military history, religions, social and cultural history,” Engle said. Many teachers try to cover everything and have little time to assign research papers that develop students’ analytical skills. Trevor Packer, College Board senior vice president for AP and college readiness, said he shares Engle’s breadth of content concerns. As part of a gradual reform of all AP subjects, Packer said, teachers preparing for the redesigned U.S. History course and exam, scheduled to take effect in fall 2014, will be given “much greater clarity and specificity” about what to cover. AP history director Lawrence Charap said key documents and specific topics have been identified. Teachers will have more time to go deep into favorite issues. Long research papers, a rarity in U.S. schools, might even be possible. Students must still face the DBQ, but they should be better prepared and less afraid. By	Jay Mathews

Let’s avoid politics in discussion of Colorado shooting
By Jamelle Bouie
Unfortunately, this morning was marked by an instance of actual news. In Aurora, Colorado — the state’s third largest city — a gunman opened fire at a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises. As told by eyewitnesses, the gunman entered from the back entrance of the theater, released two canisters of tear gas, and began firing into the crowd. Police have captured the shooter and released his name—James Holmes, age 24. At least 14 people have been killed, and 50 wounded.
Unfortunately, people have already begun to speculate about the motives of the shooting — Was it terrorism? Was it race-related (Aurora is only 47 percent white)? — and wonder about the political implications, i.e., “should we talk more about gun control?”
We don’t have enough information to make a judgment about what happened, much less use it to argue any point. What’s more, there’s something disrespectful in the rush to debate; let’s mourn for the victims before we begin to argue causes or consequences. It may well be the case that this shooting warrants a renewed national conversation over the wisdom of loose gun control. But it’s important to recognize the extent to which stricter gun laws aren’t a solution that will do away with mass shootings. If you are determined to kill a lot of people, you’ll find a way to meet your goal; after all, illegal guns work just as well as legal ones.
Finally, I want to second tech writer Anil Dash when he suggests that we look at this from the perspective of our culture and not our politics. He writes, “We marginalize & neglect our sons when they feel vulnerable, stigmatize depression & schizophrenia, and treat violence as entertainment.” Does the easy availability of firearms make mass shootings more likely than they otherwise would be? Probably. But Dash hits on a more important truth: Our treatment and understanding of mental illness is not a priority in our culture, especially when it comes to men, and it should be. What’s more, even when it comes to mentally healthy men, there are few socially acceptable ways to express their fears, their pain, and their anxieties, and boys are still raised to reject emotional expression as somehow un-masculine. “Stop crying, be a man” is still a thing that parents say to their sons, and it’s incredibly destructive.
If we really want to know why the Colorado shooting happened — or why men make up the vast majority of mass shooters — we might want to move our focus away from politics, and towards a discussion of the kind of culture we live in.

The Morning Plum: Is Obama’s 2008 coalition coming back?
By Greg Sargent
Ronald Brownstein is one of the best writers out there at explaining the impact the country’s shifting demographics are having on our politics, so when he tells you that President Obama is having some success in reassembling his 2008 coalition, you should listen to him.
Brownstein details a new National Journal poll that finds Obama’s approval is up to 51 percent, and he’s making gains among key demographics when compared to a previous poll:
Compared with the December survey, the new poll found his approval rating rising by 11 percentage points among independents; 8 among nonwhites; 6 among all whites; 7 among both college-educated white men and women; and 9 among the so-called waitress moms — white women without a college degree. Only among noncollege-educated white men did Obama remain stuck in neutral with virtually no gain from December. With most of these groups, Obama’s approval rating is approaching his actual share of the 2008 vote.
Since the December poll, of course, the economy has added over 200,000 private sector jobs in the last three months. The new poll also finds that the number who anticipate continued improvement over the next year is up to 60 percent — a key number, given the importance of public perceptions of the economy’s direction. To be sure, this poll is running higher than other polls that were taken more recently, such as the ones released earlier this week; Obama is still struggling badly with blue collar whites, a key swing constituency; and the country is still sharply divided on his performance, ensuring a very close election. But things may well be slowly moving in the right direction for him. Pollster’s average Obama approval is at 47 percent.
* Obama now in full reelection mode: It’s also perhaps not a coincidence that the above shifts coincide with a stepped up effort by Obama and the White House to shift into full political mode. The Obama team has launched a full-court-press effort to get voters to take the long view of his presidency, rather than judging him through the prism of today’s state of the economy. That’s a key goal of the full-length video documentary the campaign released last night. Getting voters to re-live the depth and severity of the crisis Obama inherited, and to accept the idea that putting the economy on a path to better days ahead is a major achievement unto itself — one that might not have happened — are crucial to his reelection chances.
* Santorum’s growing power within GOP: Nia-Malika Henderson takes stock of the astonishing level of influence that Rick Santorum has now claimed over the conservative wing of the GOP, and the problems that continues to pose for Romney’s ability to connect with crucial GOP constituencies.
In this context, it’s worth reiterating the GOP nightmare scenario: We could see Romney wining the delegate count, and the nomination, even as big chunks of the GOP feel Santorum was the rightful winner.
* GOP enthusiasm down in the dumps? Chris Cillizza and Aaron Blake ferret out a key Gallup finding: “Just 35 percent of Republicans said they would `enthusiastically’ support former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney this November, while 42 percent said their vote would be primarily against President Obama.” John McCain did notably better in this department in a Gallup poll four years ago, even though he, like Romney, also struggled with the base and benefited from a split-conservative vote. Key caveat: Republicans have now lived for four years under Obama’s tyrannical rule and will likely get extremely enthusiastic about their nominee, whoever he is, once the general election hits full boil.
* The GOP’s new spin on the Latino vote: Republican strategists are now trying to spin reporters into believing that the bad economy will offset the presidential contenders’ harsh anti-immigration rhetoric and allow them to make inroads among Latinos in key swing states like Colorado and Nevada. Of course, polling suggests Latinos agree with Dems on the economy, too.
* Get ready for Supreme Court arguments on health reform: Sam Baker has an interesting look at how the Obama administration is shifting its legal defense of the indidual mandate onto legal turf that experts say could be somewhat more favorable to the law. A ruling is expected in June — right when the GOP will likely be crowning its nominee.
* Dems keep hitting Romney on women’s health: The new DNC video out this morning encapsulates the whole women’s-health-issues case against Romney, recapping his “extreme” stances on abortion and birth control.
The fact that the video’s intended audience is women in Illinois — where GOP voting takes place Tuesday in a high-stakes primary —i underscores Dem hopes that these stances might weaken Romney among moderate Republicans and GOP-leaning independents. * Marriage equality in the Dem party platform? Jonathan Bernstein notes an important point: There’s little downside in including it, since it will energize a core Dem constituency and there’s little chance the details of the party platform will sway swing voters in any case. * Takedown of the day: Paul Krugman does a demolition job on the GOP belief, or feigned belief, in the “two miracle cures for whatever ails the economy: more tax cuts for the rich and more drilling for oil.”
Key nugget: “Employment in oil and gas extraction has risen more than 50 percent since the middle of the last decade, but that amounts to only 70,000 jobs, around one-twentieth of 1 percent of total U.S. employment. So the idea that drill, baby, drill can cure our jobs deficit is basically a joke.”
The public does seem to buy the GOP argument about Keystone, but I’m not sure anyone has polled the broader question of whether more drilling would go a long way towards fixing the economy.
* And did Obama make things worse, or are things getting better? Romney admitted last night that the economy is improving, which — presuming a world where consistency and coherence matters a little bit — would seem to undermine his continuing claims that Obama made things worse. What else?
Update: Lead item edited for accuracy.

Miss Manners: Elaborate mourning etiquette appears strange to modern eyes
By Miss Manners, DEAR MISS MANNERS: I have learned that my grandmother is dying of cancer. She is very dear to me, and her passing will be a major event in my life. Therefore, I would like to honor her by going into formal mourning.
However, I know that mourning etiquette is somewhat complicated, and it differs depending on one’s relation to the deceased, so I thought I would ask your expertise.
Archive
How long would it be seemly for me to be in mourning? What would be the appropriate clothes/colors for me to wear? Should I also avoid social events and parties for the duration? I think this will be a real comfort to me when the time comes.GENTLE READER: Mourning symbols can indeed be comforting, as gestures of piety toward the deceased. They are also useful in signaling others that the mourner is in a delicate emotional state. And this is exactly why they should not be paraded at parties.Miss Manners assumes that the complicated mourning etiquette to which you refer is the precisely mandated Victorian version, which became so elaborate and ostentatious as to be watered down and then overthrown by subsequent generations.For a granddaughter, it specified six months in plain black crepe, followed by two or three months of half-mourning in black silk with jet ornaments, followed by one to three months when touches of lavender could be added. A grandson could get away with less time, wearing a black suit with black buttons, a black tie and a black watch chain.But if all this looked overdone then, it would look ridiculous now. And it would only encourage more people to urge you to “work through your grief.” Sober clothes, usually black but sometimes white in summer, with the option of a black armband, and absence from social life other than for ceremonies, constitute dignified modern mourning.DEAR MISS MANNERS: My mother-in-law is getting married for the third time and to a man my husband, her son, does not care for. We bought them a small gift from my mother, father and ourselves as a group. We also bought them a card. Since my husband does not care for his mother’s future husband, how should we sign the card? Do you congratulate them and grin?GENTLE READER: What else were you thinking of writing on the card? “Here’s hoping this is not as big a mistake as we know it is”?Miss Manners is confident that your mother-in-law knows that her son is not rejoicing over this wedding. But she is going ahead with the marriage anyway. A poisoned card is not the way to wish her well, which is what you should be doing.DEAR MISS MANNERS: What is the best answer when someone asks you where you graduated from college and you haven’t, but really don’t want to answer in a defensive way?GENTLE READER: “I didn’t.”Miss Manners hopes you are not disappointed that she didn’t come up with a witty way of saying, “I’m just as smart as you, maybe smarter, even though you went to college and I didn’t.” That would be defensive.

Prince George’s Planning Board approves student housing complex near University of Maryland
By Ovetta Wiggins, E-mail the writer
The Prince George’s County Planning Board on Thursday approved site plans for a controversial student housing complex that could expand the population of a historic area of College Park by almost 1,000 students.
The board voted 4 to 1 to accept R&J Co.’s plans to build a mixed-use development that would include 341 residential units and 14,366 square feet of retail where the Maryland Book Exchange, a book store on Route 1, currently sits. Planning board member John P. Shoaff cast the dissenting vote.
The approval came despite objections from College Park, the University of Maryland and several residents who raised concerns about whether the project fit into the surrounding area.Shoaff said he agreed with those who questioned the compatibility of the project with the rest of the community.“This project as designed is not the way to go,” said College Park Council member Robert Day, describing the building as “generic, monotonous and unimaginative.”The Planning Board was scheduled to vote on the project in December, but decided to continue the hearing until January, giving the developer and the city time to reach a resolution about the size of the six-story building, the architectural design, and questions about whether the project meets the requirements under the sector plan for the U.S. 1 Corridor.Elisa M. Vitale, a planner for College Park, said the two parties did not agree. College Park City Council members unanimously recommended that the planning board reject the plans.“We take exception that the height has been reduced when we still have a four-story building with a two-story roof,” Vitale said. Despite the developer’s contention that the city does not want student housing on the property, she said: “This isn’t really an issue about student housing in College Park. This is about compatibility with this historic district and the residential area.”Katherine Bryant, president of the Old Town College Park Civic Association, said Thursday that high density does not belong in the neighborhood.“We as residents do not want one block to double the population of Old Town College Park,” she said. “It would basically destroy our way of living.”The university said it is not against graduate students living in the complex, but had issues about possible stormwater runoff from the development onto property the school owns and the aesthetics of the part of the building that will face school property.The decision follows a controversy that erupted in December when the board initially heard testimony on the detailed site plan.Several residents left the meeting angry after watching County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) enter the hearing room, briefly chat with and sit next to his friend and former county executive Wayne K. Curry, a consultant for the developer.The residents said they felt ignored by Baker, a man they helped to elect. They also alleged that Baker’s interaction with Curry could have swayed the board.“He was [determined to speak] to Wayne Curry in front of the planning board,” Bryant said.Scott Peterson, a Baker spokesman, said Baker’s presence at the hearing was unplanned. A student was shadowing the county executive and Baker wanted to show him the council hearing room. Baker motioned for Curry to invite him to join the two for lunch, Peterson said.Peterson added that the Baker administration does not have a position on the project.
