Kurt Busch fined $50,000, placed on probation
By Cindy Boren

Kurt Busch lost his temper in a race over the weekend and the driver, who has had anger-management problems, has been fined $50,000 and placed on probation by NASCAR for recklessly driving through Ryan Newman’s pit stall and nearly hitting crew members at Darlington Raceway.
Busch, whose suspension ends July 25, had stopped to fix his car after colliding with the wall, then headed to pit road. Newman wasn’t involved in the crash but pitted after spinning. “It's dangerous enough doing normal pit stops,” Tony Gibson, Newman’s crew chief, said. “When you come ripping through someone's pit box like that, [Busch] could have took out five or six guys, plus the officials, pretty easy. I don't know how someone didn't get run over. It's a miracle no one got hit.”
In addition to Busch, Craig Strickler, a member of his Phoenix Racing crew, was fined $5,000 and placed on probation until Dec. 31 for interfering with a camerman. Kurt Busch, with his wrecked car Saturday.
(Brian Czobat / AP)
Gibson was placed on probation until June 27 because of a rule that says a crew chief is responsible for his team members. Andrew Rueger, Newman’s gasman, was fined $5,000 and placed on probation until June 27 for not obeying a NASCAR official who told him not to pursue Busch on pit road.
Busch wasn’t talking after the scuffle or after the fine was announced. But Newman was.
“It's easy to say that Kurt blew a fuse again,” Newman said, via SI.com. “I'm not sure why he did it and tried to run over our guys and NASCAR officials. And nobody is. I think the chemical imbalance [presumably Busch’s anger management issues] speaks for itself. Kurt drilled me in pit lane and said that he was taking his helmet off, and he didn't see where he was going.
“I'm pretty sure there were 42 other guys that are taking their helmets off and doing whatever for the last 10 years, and that's the first time that's happened to me.”
In November, Busch was fined $50,000 for making an obscene gesture when his transmission broke down and for a profanity-laced tirade directed at a reporter. Shortly afterward, Penske Racing fired him.
In December, Busch said he was working with a sports psychologist. “I need to be a better person on the radio, to the team, as a leader,” Busch said then. “It's personal issues, of course, and working with a sports psychologist, I've gotten obviously a small grasp, but there's obviously bigger things that I need to accomplish and things can't happen overnight.”

PHOTOS| Le Diplomate How To: Repair an antique glass goblet
By Jeanne Huber, Q. I own an antique deep-red glass goblet with lid. The lid has been broken in several places over the years and glued back together. Is there some way or someone who can make it look like new again? Washington
(Reader photo) - Reader’s broken glass goblet lid. A. Yes. The “someone” is Giovanni Nason, owner of Giovanni Nason Glass and Crystal Restoration Center in Potomac (301-340-2624, gnason@comcast.net). A member of a family that’s been making glass on the Venetian island of Murano since the 1600s, he learned glassblowing there before immigrating to the United States. He now repairs all sorts of objects made of glass, ivory, porcelain and ceramic, including mirrors, vases and glass sculptures. After looking at a picture of your goblet, Nason declared it “a beautiful piece, probably from the 1800s.” To repair it, he would first disassemble the parts and remove the glue, which he guesses is epoxy. Then he’d glue the pieces back together using a more appropriate adhesive. Epoxy holds well but yellows and becomes noticeable with time; the kind he’d use is more stable. To make it bond well, Nason has to heat the glass, but not enough to melt the parts. To take apart the goblet and put it back together again, he would charge about $120. “If you want it to be perfect, though, that’s another story,” he says. A basic repair produces an attractive piece with mends that aren’t noticeable to a casual viewer, but if a piece has great historical value, he can be more meticulous. This is a “how to control the clutter” question: I have inherited a good number of small items, such as Wedgwood ashtrays, that are perhaps too valuable to just donate but that I no longer wish to keep. Do you know of any consignment shops in the Washington area that accept such pieces for resale?
Washington
Here are a couple of ideas.Not Too Shabby Antiques & Consignments in Alexandria (703-519-3555, www.nottooshabbyconsignments.com) accepts up to 15 small items at a time and turns over 40 percent of any sales price to consignors.Treasure Trove shops, located in McLean, Annandale and Springfield, also accept consignments of small items. But there are more restrictions, which vary by shop. For example, the McLean store accepts up to 16 items at a time but limits these to one item in each category. These stores, which support programs and services at Inova Fairfax Hospital, return half of the consigned price to consignors, but they charge a $20 annual fee to participate. A handling fee is also worked into sales prices, which means the actual sales price is higher than the “consigned price” that’s used to calculate how much sellers get. Consignment policies and shop phone numbers are listed at www.treasuretrovemclean.com, www.treasuretroveannandale.com and www.treasuretrovespringfield.com.Wherever you take your treasures, Annyce Ferrogari, a manager at Not Too Shabby, recommends researching the value of the items beforehand. “We’re not appraisers,” she says. “We can just say what we think an item would sell for in our store. That is not necessarily the same as its value somewhere else.” When consignors aren’t sure whether her estimate of the sales price reflects actual value, she suggests getting a professional appraisal. She recommends Sarah McCullom at Hidden Treasure Appraisals (703-370-2887, www.hiddentreasureappraisals.com).
