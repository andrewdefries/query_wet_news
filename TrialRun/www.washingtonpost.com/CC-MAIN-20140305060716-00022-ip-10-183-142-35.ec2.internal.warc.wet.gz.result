Right Turn: First Lady
Posted at 08:45 AM ET, 02/25/2013
Why was Michelle Obama at the Oscars?
By Jennifer Rubin
The first lady had no business taking a supporting role at the Oscars, much less using military personnel as set decoration.

Happy Hour Roundup
By Jonathan Bernstein
Matt Yglesias is absolutely right: It should be seen as a failure of the Fed when it misses its inflation target on the downside. Especially when unemployment is where it is. By law, the Federal Reserve is responsible for both price stability and full employment. It remains entirely inexplicable why Barack Obama hasn’t made it a priority to fill the Fed Board with people who want to promote economic growth.
Looking around:
1) On the same day that the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court to take up the health reform law, Mitt Romney undermined the repeal drive by admitting that the individual mandate is a GOP idea:
“The idea for a health care plan is not mine alone,” Romney said, noting support he received from The Heritage Foundation. “I was told that Newt Gingrich was one of the very first people that came up with an individual mandate.”
2) Dave Roberts on new polling that shows public support for green energy remains strong despite all the media noise about Solyndra.
3) The liberal group Protect Your Care is pressing the case against Paul Ryan’s new proposal on workplace health care: “Do the Republican candidates support Paul Ryan’s effort to take away their health insurance at work like they support his plan to take away their Medicare?”
Look for lots more pressure on the presidential and Congressional candidates in the days ahead. 4) You know you want Chris Christie junk. No, don’t bother denying it. Steve Kornacki has the best version of it today. Go ahead and click through; we won’t tell anyone.
5) The right roundly criticized North Carolina Governor Bev Perdue today for suggesting we should suspend Congressional elections, but Dave Weigel supplies the larger context.
6) Paul N. Van de Water makes the detailed wonkish case for why the supercommittee simply must include new revenues in its deficit solution.
7) Supercommittee Dems are absolutely determined to avoid the traps that snared Dems in previous showdowns, leading to them getting rolled. Really!
8) Steve Benen notes that no matter how hard Daily Caller tries to pretend otherwise, its EPA story was absolutely wrong on the facts in a manner that’s jarring even for conservative media:
9) Lawrence Mishel offers the most thorough takedown yet of the conservative idea that regulatory uncertainty is behind our economic problems. 10) Suzy Khimm has a great chart showing how government spending cuts in cities have led to massive job loss. While I still haven’t seen a good comprehensive economic estimate (including the second-order effects of all those teachers and cops and fire fighters who are worried about losing their jobs and therefore canceled vacation plans and home improvements and all), I’m convinced that slashed spending by state and local governments has been the biggest factor in derailing the recovery.
11) Obama’s annual back-to-school speech today was packed with all sorts of secret and nefarious messages designed to indoctrinate our unsuspecting children.
12) And Atrios is right: As annoying as political journalism can be these days, it’s worth keeping in mind that it was far, far, far worse during the Clinton witch hunts of the 1990s. (added by gs)

Republicans are going to need a bigger lifeboat
By Dana Milbank, Democratic lawmakers and liberal activists arranged 20 child-size chairs on the lawn outside the Capitol on Wednesday to represent 19,000 children who could lose access to Head Start because of the government shutdown — on top of the 57,000 slots lost in the low-income preschool program because of budget cuts.
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (Tex.) held up one of the blue plastic chairs. “Here is the empty chair of the next astronaut,” she said. “Here is the empty chair of a captain in the United States military.” Dana Milbank

Putin’s folly
The seats will remain unfilled. Poor kids didn’t make the cut. On the second day of the shutdown, House Republicans continued what might be called the lifeboat strategy: deciding which government functions are worth saving. In: veterans, the troops and tourist attractions. Out: poor children, pregnant women and just about every government function that regulates business or requires people to pay taxes. The lifeboat strategy was the brainchild of Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), the freshman who has become the de facto leader of congressional Republicans in the shutdown. On Tuesday, GOP House members introduced bills that would exempt three entities: the national parks, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the District of Columbia. On Wednesday, they added the National Institutes of Health and pay for National Guard members and military reservists.Here are some of the functions not boarding the GOP lifeboats: market regulation, chemical spill investigations, antitrust enforcement, worksite immigration checks, workplace safety inspections, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service’s audit capabilities, communications and trade regulation, nutrition for 9 million children and pregnant women, flu monitoring and other functions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and housing rental assistance for the poor. The pattern, it seems, is that House Republicans propose to rescue the most visible casualties of the shutdown, such as the national parks and trash collection in the capital. Efforts to help veterans, active-duty troops and reservists are popular but largely unnecessary because most of them were unaffected by the shutdown. The NIH’s work isn’t always visible, but the agency has powerful supporters who want research on their pet causes.Perhaps more revealing were those who haven’t earned a place in the conservatives’ lifeboat: entities that check the power of industry and entities that protect workers and the poor. They may be the most hurt by a government shutdown, but they don’t have a place in the conservative utopia as defined by the lifeboat strategy. The utopia remains just that, because the proposals have little chance of getting past the Democratic-controlled Senate and even less chance of surviving President Obama’s veto. The point, rather, is to make Democrats take politically damaging votes against popular programs to deflect some of the blame Republicans are getting for the shutdown. As a result, neither side is taking the proposals very seriously — as demonstrated by Wednesday’s meeting of the House Rules Committee, which debates legislation before it goes to the House floor. The lawmakers bickered about disagreements old and new but dealt little with the Republicans’ lifeboat legislation. “Not since my children were 3 or 4 years old have I seen such obstinate inability to accept the facts,” declared Rep. Louise Slaughter (N.Y.), the panel’s ranking Democrat. “A tiny and irresponsible faction is holding things up,” argued Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah). “The tiny and irresponsible faction called Harry Reid.”“Will the gentleman yield?” Slaughter asked Bishop at one point. “When you get me a rhubarb pie, I will yield to you,” Bishop replied. Not all were so playful. Reps. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) engaged in a debate covering, among other things, the national debt, Obama’s golf outing, the Senate schedule, John F. Kennedy, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Congressional Budget Office, health care and the meaning of compromise. “Do not hold the American people hostage!” McGovern shouted. “If my friend will yield, we gave the Senate three options to keep the government open,” Kingston answered. “What you did was trickery!”“Trickery?”“You tried to blackmail the president!”“Blackmail the president?”“Yeah, basically, I’m shutting the government down unless you dismantle your health care . . . ”Kingston went on to say that while Obama “is proudly negotiating with the Iranians, he will not negotiate with the Republicans.”Lost in all this was any real discussion of the topic of the day. And that’s because the lifeboat legislative strategy isn’t a serious solution to the shutdown. But it is a revealing glimpse into how the world would look if Cruz’s conservatives ran it.
