Clumsy teaching happens even in great schools
By Jay Mathews
If you thought my column two weeks ago about a struggling fifth-grader was an indictment of the Prince George’s County school system, please read the flood of comments to my blog about that.
The issue I discussed — some teachers being unable or unwilling to help a bright child with a learning disability — is not a Prince George’s problem, the responses show. It is every district’s problem.
If that is not the case, then why were there so many complaints about insensitive teachers from Montgomery County, which unlike Prince George’s is one of the wealthiest and highest-performing districts in the country? One Montgomery mother said the staff members at her daughter’s high school forgot their own promises and a psychologist’s recommendation to give the girl reminders when assignments were due. “They wouldn’t implement a plan for her because her test scores were too high,” the mother said.
Montgomery father Andrew Mitz said his son had the same condition, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as did the Prince George’s student I wrote about. Montgomery schools often did well, he said, but still, his son “too often faced teachers who would rather not trouble themselves with appropriate accommodations.”
This being the Washington area, some commenters squabbled over whether ADHD should be classified as a “specific learning disability” or “other health impairment” under federal regulations. One teacher with ADHD, Michelle McGee, said my calling it a disability was an insult to her. “I prefer to think of it as an impairment, like being near-sighted,” she said.
Whatever the federal designation, it is hard to see the condition as anything but disabling if it is keeping children from learning and teachers are not following procedures designed to help. The federal government has recognized this. A March 30, 2001, policy letter from the U.S. Education Department’s Office of Special Education Programs said that although ADHD “is not one of the specified disabilities in and of itself,” children who have it “may have a disability under one or more of the specified disabilities such as Other Health Impaired.”
I am glad we got that straight. Many of the online responses and conversations I have had with experts underline the solution. If you hire good teachers and give them the information and support they need, children with disabilities will benefit.
Duane Arbogast, the chief academic officer for Prince George’s public schools, is a former elementary school principal who has often dealt with learning disabilities. Reacting to the notion of teachers unsympathetic to an ADHD child who often forgot her homework assignments, he said: “What doesn’t work is fussing at the kid.” He said various approaches can instill good habits and help a child be responsible. Just a series of pictures reminding a student of the vital steps in checking assignments can work wonders, he said.
Many readers said students and parents should be able to retrieve forgotten assignments online. That doesn’t work for families without Internet access but might have worked for the child I was writing about, so is worth exploring. The principal of Heather Hills Elementary School, which the girl attended, said her staff members followed all the rules. The fact that that didn’t work suggests rules are not as useful as good teaching.
Helping children with disabilities can help everyone. West Laurel parent Monica Gribben, whose child is gifted and disabled, gave me an example of what a resourceful educator can do. This teacher had students lay on their desks just before final bell the items they thought they needed to take home. She walked around the room and quickly spotted anyone missing necessary materials.
That is happening in some Prince George’s classes and other places. Why not everywhere?

Frankenstorm Sandy and our weather inflation
By Alexandra Petri
AIEEEE (HO - AFP/GETTY IMAGES)
Look, I would write a longer piece about Hurricane Sandy, but I am too busy coaxing animals by pairs into a large boat. It’s a Frankenstorm! I don’t even know what that is. Sandy combines all my worst fears: giant, flooding storms, characters from “Grease” and ill-conceived portmanteaus. All I know is that it is definitely coming and we had better be prepared for judgment! They say that every time, but this time they mean it. The coverage, as far as I can tell from the bunker where I am strapped into an inflatable raft with 40 days worth of supplies, sounds something like this:
“You know how we usually say that a hurricane is coming that is going to completely ravage the Northeast corridor and cause everyone serious, life-altering discomfort? Usually, we kind of mean that. But now we really, really mean it. Gale-force winds! Locusts and hailstorms! If you have anything that you would regret never having said to your local power lines, make time to tell them now.”
“This is a snow-i-cane, a vortex of doom that will suck you in, bewilder you, and leave you stranded and desolate, similar to the experience of watching ‘Cloud Atlas’ in theaters.”
“This storm is so bad that we are being forced to use really, really terrible metaphors to describe it. It is a perfect storm. It is a snow vortex. It is like if an abominable snowman met, courted and wed a tidal wave, and once their careers settled down they decided to have a child, and that child was A FULMINATING STORMBEAST OF RAGE AND DESTRUCTION! IT IS SO BAD THAT WE JUST SLIGHTLY MISUSED THE WORD FULMINATING!” It is strange when the people who spend their days crying wolf see what they seem to be convinced is an actual wolf. Almost as bad as any actual havoc the storm plans to wreak is what it’s showing us about our weather language inflation. Our scale currently runs from RECORD-SETTING MASSIVE STORM (slight drizzle) to LITERALLY THE APOCALYPSE (record-setting massive storm). If we make it out of this one, we must demand a reset. This is getting exhausting. My default level of relaxation is a mild panic, and when you actually want to me have a panic I rove around with steam coming from my ears, vital organs bursting under strain. Look, the Mid-Atlantic is ill-equipped for this. We excite easily. We cancel school if snow is expected to fall but not hit the ground. The closest thing to a natural disaster that has hit us in a while was when we got trapped beneath the debt ceiling. We know hyperbole. Hyperbole winters here. And summers here, for that matter. We are accustomed to overblown fusses and panics, and to the inevitable anticlimax. So to describe a Really Massive Threat, we aren't just at a loss for adjectives. We’re at a loss for expletives. We have to resort to all capital letters. HISTORY, we bellow, HAS NEVER RECORDED ANY SUCH THING! I am currently cowering in a bunker, canning goods. If you asked me to sacrifice my firstborn, I would give it serious thought. On the bright side, Hurricane Sandy has saved me a lot of money that I would otherwise have spent renting bad horror movies. Who needs horror when you have the weather? By	Alexandra Petri

Morning Bits
By Jennifer Rubin
So much for scaring old people. Gallup finds older voters prefer the Paul Ryan budget over the Obama budget. Plus: “The same USA Today/Gallup survey, conducted April 20-23, finds Republicans holding a significant edge over Democrats in public perceptions of which party would do the better job of dealing with the federal budget. Nearly half of Americans, 48% prefer the Republicans in Congress on this question, while 36% favor the Democrats in Congress.”
So much for Obama’s attacks on Ryan’s Medicare proposal. James Capretta tells us: “[T]hose who are attacking the Ryan Medicare plan have a serious problem. They, starting with the president, have made a huge political issue of how that plan indexes the government’s contribution for Medicare coverage. But their own experts believe Obamacare, under certain conditions, does exactly the same thing.”
So much for Virginia “going Blue.” Peter Wehner says a lot of the credit goes to Gov. Bob McDonnell (R): “Governor McDonnell is serious and sober, fluent and knowledgeable on the issues, an engaging and likable fellow. He also, and most importantly, has amassed an impressive governing record in a short period of time. For example, he reduced state spending to 2006 levels by cutting $6 billion out of two budgets while defeating attempts to levy a $2 billion increase in the state income tax. (McDonnell inherited a budget deficit of more than $4 billion; today the state has a surplus and has demonstrated remarkable revenue growth.) The state unemployment rate has dropped to 6.3 percent today from 7.2 percent in February 2010. . . . He had arguably the most successful first legislative session of any Virginia governor in modern history.” No wonder he’s got a 66 percent approval rating.
So much for the “backlash” against Ryan’s plan. Watch how NBC News covered his town hall meetings.
So much for the conservative obsession with birtherism. “According to data from the Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism reviewed by the Poynter Institute’s Julie Moos, MSNBC had the most coverage, far ahead of Fox or CNN. ‘While MSNBC’s coverage may have been devoted to questioning or debunking the president’s citizenship issues, that network spent the most time discussing it,’ said Mark Jurkowitz, associate director of PEJ.” See, if Obama watched less MSNBC, he’d have a better impression of the media.
So much for the power of Big Labor. Gov. John Kasich (R) wins on merit pay for teachers in Ohio. “Ohio’s new law to limit collective bargaining for public workers could make it the first state with a mandatory system to pay teachers based on their performance.The measure passed by the Republican-led Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. John Kasich bans strikes by public workers and replaces automatic pay increases with merit raises or performance pay.”
So much for the “recovery.” “The Fed cut its growth estimate for 2011 to between 3.1 percent and 3.3 percent from a January forecast of 3.4 percent to 3.9 percent. The Fed also raised its estimate of inflation this year to a range of 2.1 percent to 2.8 percent, taking into account a recent surge in oil prices. However, it bumped its core inflation forecasts only marginally to a 1.3 percent to 1.6 percent range. As for unemployment, it lowered its forecast but said it would stay elevated over its three-year forecast period. For 2011, the Fed said it expects the unemployment rate to land in a 8.4-8.7 percent range, better than a range of 8.8-9.0 percent forecast in January. “ No wonder Obama wants to talk about birthers.
So much for the White House communications strategy: “It was reasonable for the White House to counteract the conspiracy types by releasing the original certificate. . . . Less evident is why Obama felt he needed to lower himself by appearing in the briefing room, escorted by his chief of staff, to defend himself against the birthers.” Maybe he’s just a desperate liberal pol? (Dana points out that Obama had his facts wrong on media coverage of the birthers.) Okay, a desperate liberal pol who play fast and loose with the facts.

Virginia Tech not legally responsible for 2007 shooting
By Clinton Yates
Last night, I made the calculated decision to not watch the Capitals, and instead attend a friend's squash tournament at a social club in D.C. Very 1 percentish, I know, but it was better than having a panic attack over that win. Laich’s goal was SWEET, though.

(Sam Dean - AP)
It appears that Virginia Tech University is off the hook legally
for its actions on April 16, 2007. When two parents of children killed in the awful massacre that took 33 lives sued the school for what they said was its late response to the initial shooting, a jury ruled against the university. But today, a federal judge overturned the decision, saying that Va. Tech did not violate federal law in its response to the shootings. Alas.
Fairfax County is one of the richest counties in America
. Per capita, it regularly ranks in the top five for income, yet it is far from insulated from the problems of the world. According to federal prosecutors, gang members made offers to a dozen or so high school girls to become prostitutes and it worked. And yes, they recruited them at bus stops, in school and on Facebook, court documents allege. The Post's Justin Jouvenal reports on how these Crips allegedly forced the girls to stay in the scheme.
This whole medical marijuana thing is becoming very real in D.C
. Today, the city will name the six groups that are allowed to grow and supply weed to users. I won't lie, there's a part of me that finds this completely unbelievable. Considering all the other problems this city has, the decision to start selling drugs is borderline baffling. That aside, Montel Williams is involved, so it must be a winner. The Post's Tim Craig reports on the announcement.
Have you ever wondered what it's like to be on a reality show?
And not one of these 'get drunk, party hard' shows, but one that involves regular people doing so-called regular, productive things. Well, when PBS put out a casting call for families to be on “Ask This Old House” and an Old Town family replied, and next thing they knew cameramen were crawling all over their house. Express's Katie Aberbach explains the process of putting your house on television.
Here's the plan for tonight
. Call your friends, cancel your lame happy hour at some bar that nobody cares about and start anew. Then, get tickets to D.C. United's game against Dallas FC. Then, go down to Lot 8 at RFK Stadium and eat at food trucks and have fun and talk to cool people. Then go watch a nationally televised game, live with your face. And at halftime, go to the drum circle on the concourse. This is what the cool kids do. You should do the same. Maybe I'll see you there.
Extra Bites
• Every once and a while, we get an 'Only in America' headline. And every once and again, we get a 'Rarely if Ever in America' headline. This is one of them — and it's fantastic.
• My main man Reg knows that I love the Twitterbox. He on the other hand is not so keen. So he suggested this for me. NSFW, I guess.
• When this movie comes out, I will dress like the poster when I show up on opening night.
