D.C. wants input on privatized streetcar system
By Mark Berman and Tim Craig
The D.C. streetcar line should be up and running on H Street next summer, and the District is open to potentially privatizing the system.
The District Department of Transportation announced Tuesday that it was seeking information from the private sector, issuing a Request for Information seeking feedback on the proposed schedule, financial plans and the overall project. The request stresses that it is just an inquiry, not any sort of contract or agreement. Still, the responses could impact the District’s plans for the project and perhaps lead to privatized elements down the line. Streetcars owned by the District of Columbia.
(Courtesy of District Department of Transportation)
Buried within the 23-page RFI is a note that the District anticipates a contract spanning at least 30 years and which would make a private entity responsible for designing, building and financing a streetcar system; at the end of the 30-year period, ownership of the system would revert to the District. Under such a contract, the District would remain in charge of fare policy, among other things. (You can read the complete request here.)
D.C. Council member Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) tried to halt the streetcar line last week, but withdrew his objection earlier this week.
The DDOT request was issued on the same day that Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) met with officials from the Export-Import Bank of China in Beijing to continue discussions about whether the bank would be interested in funding all or part of the city’s streetcar system. In an interview Friday, Gray said he was intrigued by suggestions that Chinese investors could fund the $1.5 billion project in exchange for the proceeds once the system is built out. Without private investment, Gray said it could take decades for the streetcar system to get built because the city is nearing its debt cap.
“It’s got to be something that works for them, but it’s got to be something that works for us too,” Gray said. “What is the structure of the deal? But there is certainly an interest in the streetcar system here.”
But D.C. Council member Tommy Wells (D-Ward 6), a chief proponent of constructing the streetcar system, said in an interview Tuesday that he’s “very skeptical of privatization of public transit.” Wells said he has concerns a private entity would establish fares so high that the system could become unaffordable for low-wage residents. Wells also questioned whether a private firm would prioritize lines that reach into disadvantaged neighborhoods. “There is not a great history in the country of privatization of public transit because it becomes more and more expensive,” Wells said. “The public interest is in keeping the fare box low.”
Wells noted the highest percentage of car-less District residents live in Ward 8 in Southeast. He worries that a private firm or bank wouldn’t think broadly about how best to connect those residents to jobs in neighborhoods other than downtown. “I’m concerned that privatization will work against our public policy goals of viewing transit as connecting people to opportunity,” Wells said. Though Gray stressed his talks with Chinese officials are preliminary, he said the question is how quickly residents want to move forward. Chinese officials, he said, were stunned when Gray told them in earlier meetings it would take at least 20 years for the city to build the streetcar system on its own.
“If they think they can do it quicker, we wouldn’t be adverse to that,” Gray said. Wells countered the District could expedite construction if it makes the project a budget priority that will quickly pay off due to increased economic development.

China makes increased military spending a top priority as People’s Congress meets
Feng Li/Getty Images - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, left, with Vice President Li Keqiang after Wen delivered his work report at the opening session of the annual National People's Congress in Beijing's Great Hall of the People on March 5, 2013 in Beijing.
By William Wan, E-mail the writer
BEIJING — China’s top leaders kicked off their annual parliamentary meeting Tuesday with a clear statement of national priorities: Military spending this year will grow by 10.7 percent, even in the face of modest projections for economic growth.
The figures, included in a report delivered by China’s outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao, came with standard praise for the past year’s work. But his remarks were sprinkled with admissions of problems that he and President Hu Jintao were leaving their successors, including unsustainable development, gaping income inequality, corruption, pollution, vast differences between growth rates in rural and urban areas, and innovation that is stifled by dominant state-owned enterprises.

Bombings, clashes in Iraq kill at least 42
Associated Press No one claimed responsibility for the string of bombings, mostly from parked car bombs and one explosive planted in an outdoor market. The country’s incoming leaders have vowed repeatedly in recent months to tackle those problems with economic, social and other reforms. But many experts and even some within the party believe substantive changes may prove difficult to deliver in a system geared toward the entrenched interests of government officials, China’s state companies and those with political connections.“We are keenly aware that we still face many difficulties,” Wen said, acknowledging that some “have been caused by inadequacies and weaknesses in our government work.”His report was given at the opening of the National People’s Congress, an annual parliamentary meeting comprised of highly choreographed speeches, press conferences and rubber stamp votes for initiatives laid out by the ruling Communist Party. The meeting is expected to end on March 17 with party leader Xi Jinping becoming China’s new president.The higher military spending may be an important tool for Xi as he moves to shore up personal relations with China’s generals and consolidate his powerThe military increase continues two decades of double-digit growth. But China’s projected military budget at $115.7 billion still pales in comparison to the U.S. military’s $656.2 billion budget in 2012, a point made by several Chinese military officials and experts in interviews on Tuesday. U.S. experts have long believed China under reports its military spending in its annual reports. The increase also carries strong symbolism, continuing recent years of rapid modernization of China’s forces even as the U.S. and other western powers are struggling with budget cuts. And it bolsters an increasingly aggressive foreign posture China has toward its neighbors, especially in territorial disputes with countries like Japan.Like many in the military, Luo Yuan, a major general and deputy secretary-general of the Military Science Society, downplayed the increase and any possible intimidation to neighboring countries. “Our foreign policy goal is peaceful development and strengthening defensive abilities rather than growing our ability to plunder others,” he said.On the economic front, Wen emphasized China’s broader long-term strategy of weaning the country’s dependence away from exports by increasing domestic consumption.Some experts interpreted the modest 7.5 percent target for GDP growth that he announced as a signal by the central government to provincial leaders that GDP increases are no longer the only priority after years of single-minded development have resulted in rampant pollution and other problems.To rein in property prices and a possible housing bubble, leaders also have said in recent days they plan to tighten curbs such as implementing a 20 percent tax on property sales. That news over the weekend sent Chinese stocks into a sharp decline on Monday. Economic reform is seen by leaders as a necessary, but tricky proposition, said Shen Jianguang, chief economist at Mizuho Securities Asia in Hong Kong.Too much change too quickly risks upsetting China’s economic system, he said. “The government also worries that if the economy faces a hard landing, that could trigger other things like social unrest.”Other reforms expected to be discussed at the people’s congress include a consolidation of some government ministries into a more streamlined group of “super ministries” as well as possible reform of China’s widely despised labor camp system. But former officials and analysts said more ambitious earlier proposals on both fronts seem to have been scaled back in recent days.Analysts are also closely watching several high-ranking personnel appointments in coming days for clues about who may be positioning for a seat in coming years on the party’s top ruling standing committee.
