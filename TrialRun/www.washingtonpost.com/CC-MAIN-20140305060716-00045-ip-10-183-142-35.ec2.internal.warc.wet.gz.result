Hemp flag to fly high over Capitol building
By Emily Heil
E-mail the writer
In a screenshot from the farm bill debate Rep. Jared Polis holds the hemp flag.
(Courtesy C-SPAN)
The flag flying over the Capitol building on the Fourth of July might look like your typical Old Glory. But you probably won’t notice the fibers that make it special. It’s believed to be the first hemp flag to flutter over the dome since the government began outlawing marijuana’s less-recreational cousin back in the 1930s.
Colorado hemp advocate Michael Bowman is the man responsible for getting the flag, made from Colorado-raised hemp and screen-printed with the stars and stripes, up there. He cooked up the idea while lobbying Congress this year to include pro-hemp measures in the farm bill. That legislation failed, of course, but the seed of the hemp flag had been planted. Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) gave Bowman an assist with the details, which included working with the Capitol’s flag office. (The flag program allows people to buy flags flown over the Capitol, so they rotate in new Old Glories nearly every day.)
“It’s a powerful symbol,” Bowman says, adding that the red, white and blue flying over the Capitol is a reminder of the role that hemp played in the founding and early days of the country. Betsy Ross’s flag was made of hemp, he notes, and Colonial settlers even paid their taxes in the crop — it was used for all kinds of goods, from rope to fabric to paper. Those Conestoga wagons heading west were covered in canvas fashioned from hemp fibers.
So, he thought having it fly on America’s birthday seemed pretty appropriate.
After its Capitol flight, the flag will make its way back to Colorado, where it will fly over the state capitol building in Denver. After that, Bowman is sending it out on a tour of state houses in states where there’s legislation pending that would legalize hemp. One of the first up: Vermont. And while advocates are quick to point out that hemp lacks the THC content beloved by stoners, this will still be one high-flying flag.

D.C. United news & notes
By Steven Goff
D.C. United captain Dax McCarty has recovered from a groin ailment that sidelined him for both West Coast matches and is likely to start Saturday night against the San Jose Earthquakes at RFK Stadium.
“I was pretty frustrated for a week or so with a little nagging injury that you really don’t even understand how you pick up,” the central midfielder said after Friday’s training session. “I feel like I am good to go and fairly close to 100 percent. I lost maybe a tiny bit of fitness, but nothing to dramatic.”
Midfielder-forward Santino Quaranta (concussion) remains outand hasn’t been training. “He’s still struggling,” Coach Ben Olsen said.
Defender Marc Burch (hamstring) is still sidelined. Midfielder Kurt Morsink (ankle) says he is about a week from returning. Defender Jed Zayner (hamstring) is working on fitness after a long layoff and could return soon.
For additional notes.....
Forward Josh Wolff played seven seasons for Kansas City before signing with United over the winter. So what did he think of Livestrong Sporting Park, which was christened on national TV last night?
“Great stadium, great stadium ... everything after that, it wasn’t a great game,” he said. “Those owners have done an outstanding job building a top-notch stadium. It makes this game go; every team needs it. Hopefully D.C. gets one soon. It’s imperative in order for the game to continue to grow, to attract new fans and bigger sponsors. [LSP] is outrageously nice.”
TV coverage Saturday: Comcast SportsNet at 7:30 p.m.
Attendance: I’m guessing 13,000.
A new field has been laid out at RFK to better combat the summer heat.
Courtesy of DCU communications ace Alex Caulfield, the two MLS players with the longest last names (14 letters) could face one another Saturday: United’s Blake Brettschneider and San Jose’s Anthony Ampaipitakwong. The Earthquakes midfielder wins the tiebreaker on first names (7-5).

Serena Williams fined $2,000 for ‘verbal abuse’ of U.S. Open chair umpire
View Photo Gallery — Scenes from the final Grand Slam of the tennis season at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, N.Y. By — Liz Clarke, FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y.— U.S. Open officials on Monday fined Serena Williams $2,000 for “verbal abuse” of the chair umpire during Sunday’s women’s final against Australian Samantha Stosur.
That translates to 0.14 percent of the $1.4 million Williams earned for her runner-up performance, with Stosur defeating the three-time U.S. Open champion her first major title 6-2, 6-3.

Serena Williams fined $2,000 for verbal abuse
Williams, 29, was still on probation for her outburst at a lineswoman in the 2009 semifinals when Sunday’s incident occurred. (Her two-year suspension was due to end at the conclusion of the match).In order for Sunday’s outburst to trigger further sanctions under terms of her 2009 probation, the recent episode would have had to be deemed a “major offense” by the Grand Slam Director.According to the statement released by U.S. Open referee Brian Earley Monday, Grand Slam officials decided that it didn’t rise to that level.“After independently reviewing the incident which served as the basis for the code violation, and taking into account the level of fine imposed by the US Open referee, the Grand Slam Committee Director has determined that Ms. Williams’ conduct, while verbally abusive, does not rise to the level of a major offense under the Grand Slam Code of Conduct,” the statement read.Eva Asderaki, the chair umpire for Sunday’s women’s final, docked Williams a point penalty for interfering with Stosur’s concentration by shouting “Come on!” while the ball was still in play after hitting what looked like a forehand winner. Having lost the first set, Williams, serving the first game of the second set, needed the game badly.The point penalty, coming at break point, cost Williams the service game.After the chair umpire explained her ruling on what’s known as a “hindrance” violation, Williams berated her and continued to do so during the changeover that followed. She was then cited with a code violation for “verbal abuse.”In her post-match interview, Williams acknowledged that she was trying to use her anger over the call to fire herself up for a comeback after a sub-par performance in the first set.“Definitely I tried to get more fired up and kinda get more like into it and kinda get more Serena-esque and in to the match and get going and stuff like that,” Williams said.
