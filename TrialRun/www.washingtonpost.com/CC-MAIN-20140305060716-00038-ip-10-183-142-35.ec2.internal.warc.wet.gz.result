Take The Sheet's 2009 Education Quiz
By Valerie Strauss
Happy and healthy new year to all of you ... and now let’s start off the new decade with, appropriately for an education blog, a quiz. I thought about doing one of those top 10 education story of the year or decade lists, but realized it would be repetitive: Budget cuts hurt K-12; budget cuts squeeze community colleges big-time; budget cuts and endowment losses bring pain to colleges and universities ... etc. A quiz sounded more fun. Here are some unusual education stories you may not have read in 2009. Take a look and guess from where they came. Where, for example, did a university professor try to teach math to middle school students but give up after two months because the kids were so unruly? Where did a teacher accidentally put pornography on a DVD of school memories? What books were more challenged?

‘BORDERTOWN’: Lalo Alcaraz on joining Seth MacFarlane’s new Fox immigration comedy
By Michael Cavna
E-mail the writer
HAVING THE name “Seth MacFarlane” attached to an animated show about immigration already had some pop-culture watchers on high alert.
A new name on the project, though, seems to have assuaged some concerns.
Lalo Alcaraz, the commentator and creator of the syndicated, sociopolitically themed strip “La Cucaracha,” has been announced as a writer on the show “Bordertown,” which is set to debut next fall on Fox.
Now there’s a distinct ray of hope that even if the show takes satiric swipes at immigrants, those one-liners will be just one part of an equal-opportunity comedy.
“Everybody gets poked fun at in ‘Bordertown,’ “ Alcaraz tells Comic Riffs, “but its main focus is the changing world around the modern-day Archie Bunker, put-upon character, [Border Patrol agent] Bud Buckwald -- and his relationship with his neighbor, the unflappable and optimistic Mexican immigrant character, Ernesto Gonzalez.”
"Bordertown’s” lead characters include Archie Bunker-like Border Patrol agent Bud Buckwald and his unflappable Mexican-immigrant neighbor, Ernesto Gonzalez.
(Created by SETH MacFARLANE - Courtesy of FOX TV)
“Bordertown” is set in a fictitious Texas town near the U.S.-Mexico border. And if the cast of characters was going to be diverse, then it made sense to have the writers’ room reflect that.
“The writers’ room is actually pretty diverse, and we are focused on doing political and social satire with some meaning,” says Alcaraz, a California native of Mexican American descent. He is a vocal commentator on issues concerning Latinos, largely through both his comic strip, which became syndicated in 2002, and his L.A.-area radio show, "Pocho Hour of Power.” [LALO ALCARAZ: On creating Occupy Art]
So how did Alcaraz — author of the upcoming book “Imperfect Union” (Basic Books) — become involved?
“I was called in by creator Mark Hentemann, who was looking for diverse writers for ‘Bordertown,’ “ says Alcaraz, who has noted that four of the show’s dozen writers or so are Mexican American. “He had read in Gustavo Arellano's ‘Ask A Mexican’ book that I was known to be a somewhat funny fellow.”
[LALO ALCARAZ: On caricaturing Mitt Romney]
As a fan of MacFarlane’s “Family Guy,” Alcaraz has a sense of what he’s in for. He’s only several days into the job, however — what will he do the first time he thinks a stereotype in the script crosses the line?
“I don’t know,” Alcaraz jokes. “Pray for me.”

An earlier version of this article misspelled the first name of a spokesman for the Washington Gas Light Co. He is Ruben Rodriguez. This version has been corrected.
Washington Gas to clean Anacostia riverbank under new agreement
By Darryl Fears, E-mail the writer
Washington Gas Light Co. has agreed to clean a section of land along the Anacostia River that it contaminated with harmful chemicals for more than a century, federal officials announced Monday.
As part of an agreement involving the utility, the U.S. Interior Department and the D.C. government, Washington Gas will also pay for a comprehensive investigation of toxic contamination of soil and groundwater on the site. It will repay nearly $1 million to federal agencies for investigations that revealed how badly the river was fouled where the company once processed gas.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar called the agreement “a milestone in our efforts . . . to transform what was once known as America’s forgotten river into a model urban park.” A walkway is slated to traverse the area once when the work is done.But the Anacostia Watershed Society said much is unknown about the agreement, including its cost and how the utility will be held accountable for its work. “How much they’re committing is really unclear at this point,” said Brent Bolin, director of advocacy for AWS.A Washington Gas spokesman said contaminated soil will be removed and replaced with clean soil over four acres. The spokesman, Ruben Rodriguez, declined to give an estimate of the cleanup cost.For 60 years, from 1888 to 1948, the utility manufactured gas feed stocks at a facility along Water Street SE, just upstream from the 11th Street Bridge on the river. Waste created by the gasification process contained harmful organic compounds such as benzene, cyanide, arsenic and other contaminants such as tar, coal and coke.The company continued to use the “East Station” site intermittently until it was closed in 1983 and demolished in 1986. Between that time and 1999, six major federal environmental investigations were performed at the site.“This has been a cleanup 100 years in the making,” Bolin said. “These are known carcinogens. They are an exposure risk for people who fish, people who boat, people who row.”The Anacostia River was called “one of the most polluted waterways in the nation” in a May report by the advocacy group DC Appleseed.With its low flows, the Anacostia cannot easily flush pollutants, many of which come from combined sewage runoff and from chemical waste from the Navy Yard, according to the report. It called on the federal government, as one of the river’s biggest polluters, to take a larger role in the cleanup.Despite of a 2006 federal decision that called for a cleanup amid hiking trails, yacht clubs and a fishery, work was never completed, Bolin said. AWS filed a suit in August to compel the utility and federal government to act. “You couldn’t get the federal government to care about this issue until the Obama administration,” Bolin said.The city has been acquiring land nearby with an eye on its Anacostia Waterfront Initiative, a vision for recreational, residential and commercial development along the river.“This settlement is a major step forward in restoring this vibrant river . . . [and] protecting habitat and wildlife,” Salazar said.
