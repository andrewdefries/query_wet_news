Disunity is killing Labor, says Crean
Map: Australia
Julia Gillard has declared Labor's leadership ructions "completely at an end" after being elected unopposed as leader following a farcical Caucus leadership spill.Labor once again revealed its deep internal divisions as the spill, called for 4:30pm AEDT, fizzled out following former PM Kevin Rudd's announcement that he would not run.The Prime Minister was duly re-elected unopposed and unanimously, along with her Deputy Wayne Swan.The spill was called after a dramatic intervention from party elder Simon Crean, who demanded the leadership be put to a vote to end the "disunity" which he said was killing the party. Speaking after the Government withdrew its contentious media reform bills because they had failed to attract enough support in the House of Representatives, Mr Crean had called on Mr Rudd to show his hand and stand against the PM. "I don't want any more games, I'm sick to death of it, it's about time he stood up and instead of having his camp leak things, actually have the courage of his conviction and his belief," Mr Crean said. But just 10 minutes before the ballot, Mr Rudd said he would not dishonour his previous promises not to stand.Look back at how the day unfolded using our live blog (All times AEDT):7:30pm: That's where we leave today's live blog. If you'd like a more detailed wrap, check out a full summary of the day's extraordinary events from our chief political correspondent. You can follow more developments at the ABC News home page, or by watching ABC News 24. Here are the main players giving their take on the challenge that never was:
