Silvio Berlusconi in Giappone in 2008 (Ricardo Stuckert/PR; Agência Brasil)
Silvio Berlusconi, forced out of office by Italy’s financial crisis in 2011, is about to make a political comeback, despite a tax fraud conviction and the impending 'bunga bunga' court case, where he is accused of paying for sex with an underage nightclub dancer. No pasta or pizza but plenty of politics on Rear Vision as Italians go to the polls.A general election to determine the 630 members of the Chamber of Deputies and the 315 members of the Senate, the two houses of the Italian parliament, will take place on 24–25 February 2013. Silvio Berlusconi will lead the centre-right parties, although he has said he does not want the prime ministership. A centre-left grouping under Pier Luigi Bersani is expected to win in the lower house, but there are a couple of new players—Civic Choice, led by Mario Monti, who took over as prime minister to deal with the economic crisis in 2011, and Five Star Movement, led by comedian/activist Beppe Grillo—that lend an unpredictability to the outcome.
