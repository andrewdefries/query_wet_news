Ezekiel Kemboi has won the men's 3000 metres steeplechase, continuing Kenya's dominance of the long-distance event.The gold medal means Kenya has not lost the Olympic event since 1984.Kemboi set aside thoughts of an assault charge he faces at home to regain his Olympic title won in 2004.American Donald Kabral led after the first 1,000m in a tight pack, but the Kenyan bunch of Kemboi, Abel Kiprop Mutai and Beijing gold medallist Brimin Kiprop Kipruto took charge over the second third.Kipruto nearly took out half the field near the half-way mark when he lost his footing, but recovered well to challenge in the final lap.France's Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad joined the leading pack in the final 1,000m, before Kemboi surged to lead by an imposing margin.Kipruto, who said he had been tripped, got up from his fall to finish fifth as Kemboi stormed home in 8:18.56.Mekhissi-Benabbad, a good friend of Kemboi, took silver and Kenya's Abel Mutai won bronze. Kipruto, who said he had been tripped, got up from his fall to finish fifth.Flamboyant twice world champion Kemboi, who veered across the track with one arm raised in celebration in the final metres, was accused in June of stabbing a woman in Kenya, with the incident remaining unresolved coming into the Games.Kemboi, a police officer, has rejected the accusation and Kenya's Olympic Committee cleared the 30-year-old to run in London, saying he was innocent until proven guilty by a court of law.Kemboi announced his retirement from the track moments after victory to start a marathon career."I had planned to quit while at the top. I have two Olympic titles, two world titles and one Commonwealth title. That is enough. I will henceforth run marathon," he said."We have been planning with my coach (Moses Kiptanui) about this and I feel this is the time to move on."Kipruto said he could not come back after being tripped with around 700m to go."I tried hard to recover but two athletes stepped on me while I was down," he lamented.Ethiopia's Roba Gari finished fourth.ABC/Reuters

For the first time in seven years the Israelis and the Palestinians are sitting down to talk peace. In 2000 the talks between Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat were held by Bill Clinton at Camp David, and they broke down over the right of return of Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem. This time around, Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas will be hosted by George W Bush at the Annapolis naval academy. Our guests Yossi Beilin, chairman of the political party Meretz, and Daniel Seidman are sceptical. Unless Israel is prepared to discuss core issues such as; a divided Jerusalem, defined borders for a two-state solution and Palestinians' right of return, they may as well stay at home.

Stephen Crittenden: Welcome to the program.It's seven years since the Israelis and the Palestinians sat down at Camp David to talk peace. On that occasion, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian chairman, Yasser Arafat were hosted by President Bill Clinton, and they talked each other to a weary stalemate over issues like the right of return of Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem.Next week at the Annapolis Naval Academy in Maryland, the two sides will sit down and try again. President George W. Bush will host Ehud Olmert and Mahmoud Abbas and today the Americans have issued invitations to 40 different States, including Syria and Saudi Arabia, inviting them to be there.In recent weeks, it's seemed that there is a new willingness on the part of the Israelis to address core issues. In October, Prime Minister Olmert told the Knesset that Israel would have to be prepared to give up some of its deepest desires. The Israeli government has also signalled that it's prepared to consider the possibility of a broad-based pull-out from the occupied West Bank and even a divided Jerusalem. More recently, a senior Orthodox Rabbi in the United States, Rabbi Joseph Kanefsky, brought a
