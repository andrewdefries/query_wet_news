Water crisisAs the 'worst drought in 1000 years' continues, we're looking at all options for a secure water source. Are desalination, recycling sewage or bans on hoses really the answer? Will fixing the Murray solve the whole problem? Can we just hold out until the drought's over, or do we need a complete overhaul of our water use?

One-in-1000-year drought
Are we really in a one in 1000 year drought? What evidence is there for this? Is it plausible that the drought may be part of a recurring pattern and not linked to global warming? — Philip Smith, Marden Hundley, Jeff, Ian Fletcher and Ian
The one in 1000 year comment [made by David Dreverman, general manager of River Murray Water at the Murray Darling Basin Commission] - see below - referred more to inflows to the Murray River. We have had comparable droughts, but now farm dams, forestry and excessive use of borewater are causing less water to get to the river.
— Prof Prof Peter Cullen, Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, Emeritus professor, University of Canberra
There is no evidence for the 'one in a thousand year' claim at all. The rainfall records that can provide us with an adequate overall picture for Australia cover only a little over a century.
The Bureau of Meteorology website provides a graph of Australian rainfall statistics that includes the Murray-Darling Basin's, up to and including the last complete year, which is the year 2005. This suggests that probable over-allocation of water resources in earlier years of relative plenty have exacerbated the present dry year of 2006.
— Peter Schwerdtfeger, Emeritus professor of meteorology, Flinders University
Note: The widely reported "one in 1000 year" drought comment was made by David Dreverman, general manager of River Murray Water at the Murray Darling Basin Commission on November 7, 2006. An explanation of the data on which he based his comment is provided on the Murray Darling Basin Commission website.

Stormwater
What is the feasibility and economics of harvesting the seemingly enormous amount of water that runs through our stormwater drains, especially in large cities and coastal areas? I see water flowing down the footpath in heavy rain and it just goes out to sea - which causes problems on the beach as well.— Carol Wood, David Abercrombie and Jennifer Dietrich
Stormwater is a tantalising source, but it has some problems - it comes unpredictably, in anything from a drizzle to a massive flood. Effectively catching and storing rainfall is difficult, since there's not much room in urban areas to build storage tanks or reservoirs.
Stormwater gets contaminated as it runs over dirty surfaces, so it needs to be treated too - but there's no room in most urban areas to build treatment plants.
There are probably some practical opportunities to capture and use stormwater. One of the best is to create wetland ponds, Canberra and Adelaide do this, to collect stormwater and allow suspended matter to settle out. If there's a suitable aquifer - as happens in Adelaide, Perth and to a limited extent in the Botany sands in Sydney - the cleaner stormwater can be injected into the aquifer, then pumped out for use later.
Another possibility is utilising areas where old dams or current storm surge holding areas are available. It could be feasible to trap water in those, and then use it later. Every site has its own opportunities and constraints, so there's no general answer, but it's worth looking for suitable sites in any community.
— Chris Davis, CEO, Australian Water Association
The problem with stormwater is how to capture and store it until it's needed. Canberra does this by trapping it in urban lakes. Adelaide does it by cleaning the water in wetlands and then pumping it into the groundwater until it's needed.
We need to consider utilising runoff when planning our cities. We can and are doing it in new developments but it's very difficult in established cities.
— Prof Peter Cullen, Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, Emeritus professor, University of Canberra
There is more we can do to make better use of runoff and stormwater, especially in urban areas. The major difficulties that need to be overcome are managing the pollution in urban runoff and stormwater, and storing the water when it is in abundance so that it's available at other times.
The economics of utilising stormwater and runoff are largely affected by the cost of storage - it is very expensive to have large areas for dams or ponds in urban areas. This means that storage in aquifers can be a good alternative if such aquifers exist close by areas where stormwater can be harvested. Retrofitting to existing urban designs is often very expensive but this should become part of any redevelopment of new areas.
There is a lot of experimentation and trialling of different design and control systems.
Many new urban developments are incorporating holding ponds and detention areas to hold stormwater that allow screening for large debris and get some settling of sediment. There are some trials that take the water and pump it into underground aquifer systems for later use, which can be a very good way of holding and using this water. Unfortunately not all areas have suitable aquifers. These systems also need to be very careful not to introduce pollutants, such as petroleum products or chemicals, because these pollutants are very difficult to clean up.
Other areas (such as Adelaide) are incorporating wetlands, which help in retaining stormwater and subsequently help in cleaning it up.
— Dr Wayne Meyer, Chief Scientist CRC for Irrigation Futures
