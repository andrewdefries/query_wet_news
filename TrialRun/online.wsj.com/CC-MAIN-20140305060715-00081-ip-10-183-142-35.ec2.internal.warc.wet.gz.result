According to a report published in the Times of London on Wednesday, Qatar is preparing to permanently alter the global soccer landscape with a lavish tournament for the world's most prestigious clubs. But within hours of its publication, questions emerged over its authenticity. The Times insisted the story was true, while a French website said that it had published the same news a day earlier as a hoax. The Times report said that a soccer tournament called the Dream Football League, backed by the Qatari royal family, was offering Europe's top clubs in excess of $250 million to compete in a 24-team event in the Persian Gulf every two years. It added that the DFL was hoping to get off the ground in 2015 with 16 so-called "permanent" teams, including the likes of Manchester United and Barcelona, and eight more invitees. An artist illustration of the planned Qatar World Cup stadium
Bloomberg News Except the same news had also appeared on the quasi-satirical Cahiers du Football, a soccer site in France, in the form of a fake wire story credited to the nonexistent "Agence Transe Presse." The French piece included many of the same details as the Times and both outlets used the same DFL logo. The Qatari Football Association denied any involvement in a statement posted on its website. "With regard to the story published in today's edition of The Times newspaper concerning a 'Dreams Football League,' the Qatar Football Association and other Qatari football entities can categorically confirm that we have no involvement in any such initiative and has heard nothing to suggest such a concept is genuine," the statement read. The French story appeared in the early hours of Tuesday. The Times' three-page report appeared in print on Wednesday morning. Jérôme Latta, Cahiers du Football's editor, tweeted in French Wednesday from the handle @cahiersdufoot that, "We published this in the night of Monday to Tuesday around 1 a.m.... Everything came from my imagination." Latta did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon. But Oliver Kay, the reporter behind the Times' story, which quoted "one source close to the project," defended it on Wednesday. He wrote on Twitter that Cahiers du Football "was 100% NOT the source of my story" and further disputed Cahiers du Football's claim in a webcast. A spokesperson for the Times said that the newspaper stands by the story. A spokesman for UEFA, European soccer's governing body, said Wednesday afternoon that he had seen the articles in Cahiers du Football and the Times. But, he added, "We are not aware of such plans." —Joshua Robinson Enlarge Image
Wes Welker
Getty Images Manning Takes Away Key Target for Brady Former New England Patriots receiver Wes Welker agreed to join the Denver Broncos on Wednesday, giving quarterback Peyton Manning a speedy weapon in the slot to round out of the NFL's best offenses. While adding Welker in his own right would be a coup for John Elway and his team, the Broncos get the added bonus of stealing a key piece from a conference rival. The Patriots will enter next season without a legitimately experienced receiver unless they make more moves this offseason. Welker caught 118 passes for 1,354 yards last season. In other free agency news, the Detroit Lions snatched running back Reggie Bush from the Dolphins to give the team a much-needed running threat to go along with their high-powered passing game. —Kevin Clark
