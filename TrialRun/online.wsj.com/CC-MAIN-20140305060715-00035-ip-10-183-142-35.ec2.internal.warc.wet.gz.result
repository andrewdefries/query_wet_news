BERLIN—
Laurent Daniels went to a nightclub to dance on New Year's Eve—and ended up staying for 34 hours. Journal Report Read the complete Germany report. The 48-year-old actor and film-and-television scriptwriter says that by the end, he could no longer stand. "My clothes were completely wrecked. Everything was dirty and spoiled," he says. The site of Mr. Daniels' marathon dance party was Berghain, a renowned nightclub in a converted power station in the Friedrichshain neighborhood of East Berlin that opened in 2004. Berghain sits atop a rich club scene in Berlin that grew out of underground techno parties staged in abandoned buildings after the fall of the Berlin Wall and that now generates some €1 billion ($1.43 billion) in revenue annually, including clubs, music labels, event organizers and technology providers. Many people travel to Germany to see its beautiful castles and churches, but Berghain has created its own wave of tourism, attracting club-goers from around the world to its dark corridors, hard music, 60-foot-high ceiling and multiple dance floors. Like the rest of Berlin, Berghain isn't known for its upscale design or Hollywood-style glamour. But that, partiers say, is exactly what makes Berlin, Germany's capital, the coolest city in Europe. "You can do anything you want here. Nobody cares," Nick Pertsch,
a night manager at Berghain, says of Berlin. "It doesn't matter how much money you have or how you look." Industrial Charm Enlarge Image
Tresor's home is a renovated power plant in East Berlin.
Tofa While Berlin has always been a city rich in night life—its vibrant cabaret clubs in the 1920s and 1930s helped inspire an award-winning Broadway play and movie—the current club scene can trace its roots back to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, which left East Berlin littered with empty buildings. With little money for renovations, property owners began renting the spaces to club organizers to host parties on a short-term basis. The organizers invested very little in the buildings, creating a feeling of spontaneity, improvisation and industrial charm, says Heiko Hoffmann,
editor of Groove, an electronic-music magazine in Berlin. Tresor, which opened in an underground bank vault, and E-Werk, located near Checkpoint Charlie, were among the early Berlin clubs to embrace techno, a style of electronic music native to Detroit. The hard, abrasive industrial sound fit perfectly with the dark seediness of Berlin clubs at the time. It even helped to unite the formerly divided city, many say, because the music was new to both East and West Berliners. "For East and West Berliners, [techno music] was neutral ground," Mr. Hoffmann says. While East Berlin has changed considerably in 20 years, the seedy image of Berlin clubs has remained. Indeed, when Tresor reopened after a two-year break in 2007, the owners chose a renovated power plant in Berlin's Mitte neighborhood to mimic the same underground, chaotic feel it had in the early days, says Rick Kay,
a technical director for the club. A Tourist Draw Enlarge Image
Tresor's home is a renovated power plant in East Berlin.
Tofa With roughly 300 clubs with enough capacity to entertain 50,000 people, Berlin attracts thousands of tourists every year, helped by low-cost airlines that make it easy for people to come to the city for a party weekend. Last year 9 million tourists visited Berlin. When visitBerlin, a tourism-advocacy group, asked 19,000 visitors in an August 2010 survey what they did, 35% listed night life as one of the activities. At any given time, roughly half the club visitors in Berlin are tourists, according to the Berlin Club Commission, a trade association. People often brave long lines and cold weather in the winter to get into Berghain, a notoriously selective club that ranked sixth in an annual DJ Mag survey of the 100 best clubs globally this year, down from No. 1 in 2009. Despite refusing entrance to some, Berghain frowns upon V.I.P. entrances and areas inside the club. Fans say the club, which has a hedonistic reputation and forbids photography, has no mirrors so people can relax and not worry about how they look. The Saturday night party can continue into early Monday morning. When Thomas Schmidt of Spokane, Wash., quit his marketing job to travel around the world last year, he stopped in Berlin and spent two weekends partying at Berghain. Since then, the 31-year-old has moved to Berlin, is learning German and looking for a job. In Berlin there's no expectation that people dress a certain way or live by a normal schedule, says Mr. Schmidt, who likes to go to Berghain on Sunday mornings. "I roll out of bed, splash some water on my face and grab a beer," he says. "I walk to Berghain and I'm dancing all day." Mr. Lawton is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal based in Berlin.

Updated Feb. 19, 2010 12:01 a.m. ET
In a fresh advance for the burgeoning field of personalized medicine, researchers have developed a blood test based on the DNA of tumors that could help tailor treatment for individual cancer patients. The report, announced Thursday, represents one of the most tangible examples yet of how the ability to sequence a person's entire genetic code could have a direct impact on patient care. There have been a flurry of reports on new sequencing technology that is yielding enormous amounts of information about genetics and disease, but that has yet to deliver much in the way of new treatment strategies. "For cancer patients there hasn't been much utility so far. This may prove to be one of the first useful approaches," said Victor Velculescu,
co-director of the cancer biology program at Johns Hopkins University's Kimmel Cancer Center and senior author of the new study. Much research involving whole-genome sequencing is aimed at finding differences in the individual letters that make up the genetic code. The belief is that those small alterations will point to molecular pathways that regulate disease, which would be potential targets for drug therapies. The Hopkins researchers, writing in the journal Science Translational Medicine, took a different approach. They scanned the DNA of tumors taken from six patients with breast or colon cancer, looking not for tiny DNA changes, but what they call rearrangements in large sections of the genome of tumor cells. The DNA of tumors varies genetically from that of normal tissue, and the rearrangements are essentially a fingerprint of the cancer. The findings suggest that by testing blood for this fingerprint, doctors will be able to learn whether a patient treated for cancer is free of disease or needs additional or more aggressive care. "It's a very clever use of the [sequencing] technology," said Jeffery Schloss, program director for genome technology at the National Human Genome Research Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Schloss, who wasn't involved with the Hopkins study, likened the approach to drawing a map. Sequencing the letters of the genetic code would be akin to plotting every house in a large neighborhood. The Hopkins team was looking only for neighborhoods—in particular, neighborhoods out of place compared with where they would be in normal tissue. The uniqueness of such "neighborhood" rearrangements is what makes the DNA a good biomarker for the status of tumors, Dr. Velculescu said. A blood test can detect evidence of even minuscule levels of such alterations. That can indicate, for instance, whether a tumor may be progressing after initially responding to treatment or whether any residual disease is present after surgery to remove a tumor. That could help a doctor and patient decide what other treatment options to pursue. In the study, researchers tracked for two years one patient whose disease initially responded to treatment and then recurred. Levels of the DNA marker in the patient's blood accurately reflected the course of the disease, researchers said. The test wouldn't help predict which drugs a patient is likely to respond to—that likely would require a more detailed DNA scan, researchers said. This advance comes as the cost of sequencing a patient's entire genome has fallen sharply—to less than $10,000 now from about $1 million three years ago, according to companies that make sequencing machines. Experts predict that the cost will soon get to about $1,000, potentially making it affordable for medical centers to routinely run the genome of patients with cancer and other diseases. Currently, cancer doctors often use CT scans to check on the status of a tumor—at a cost of about $1,500, the Hopkins researchers said. They estimated the current cost of the DNA test at about $5,000 but suggest the cost will soon be comparable to a CT scan. Hopkins has filed patents for the technology. Dr. Velculescu and two other co-authors of the paper are entitled to a share of royalties on sales of any products related to the research if it is commercialized. Further research is necessary to validate the approach with more patients and more cancer types, but researchers said such a test could be ready to use within two years and widely available "within several years."

India Nears Stock-Trading Band
Bourses, Regulator Are Close to Setting Up Circuit Breakers for Shares, NSE Chief Says
By
Aries Poon
Updated Oct. 15, 2012 12:01 a.m. ET
TAIPEI—India's bourses are working with the country's stock-exchange regulator to prevent a recurrence of the "flash crash" this month that briefly shaved as much as $70 billion off the value of some of the country's largest listed companies, National Stock Exchange Chief Executive Ravi Narain said Sunday. Erroneous orders placed by a single brokerage firm on Oct. 5 sent the NSE's main index, the 50-stock Nifty, falling as much as 16% in just a few seconds. Although most of the stocks recovered soon after a...
