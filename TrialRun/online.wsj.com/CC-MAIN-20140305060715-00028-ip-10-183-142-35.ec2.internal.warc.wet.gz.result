U.S. stocks were trading higher Friday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 123 points to 13984, the Standard & Poor's added 11 points to 1509, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 19 points to 3161. Among companies with shares actively trading in Friday's session are Merck & Co. (MRK), Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) and Life Time Fitness Inc. (LTM). Merck ($41.89, -$1.36, -3.15%) reported a 7% decline in fourth-quarter profit, as last year's loss of patent protection for the asthma treatment Singulair continued to pressure the drug maker's sales. While Merck's quarterly and full-year 2012 results topped analysts' expectations, the company said it expected adjusted earnings and sales to decline slightly for 2013, though the forecast bracketed current Wall Street estimates. The company also announced it will put off submitting bone-building drug odanacatib for regulatory approval until next year, citing the need for additional clinical-trial data. It had been target not later than mid-2013. Tyson's ($22.91, +$0.79, +3.57%) fiscal first-quarter earnings jumped 11% as the meat processor's results from chicken and beef sales improved on stronger prices and margins. Tyson beat earnings expectations. Life Time Fitness ($40.49, -$10.24, -20.19%), which operates exercise and recreation centers, preannounced fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenue below analysts' estimates and cut its full-year outlook as well. The company also forecast fiscal-year 2013 earnings below analysts' expectations. Audience Inc. (ADNC, $15.30, +$3.08, +25.20%) swung to a fourth-quarter profit and its revenue surged as the audio-processing firm said more mobile devices are using its technology. The company also gave a first-quarter view that significantly topped Wall Street estimates. 
 
    Other Stocks To Watch: 
 Medical-devices company Abaxis Inc. (ABAX, $44.93, +$6.21, +16.04%) reported fiscal-third quarter results that beat consensus estimates. New distributors' purchasing drove the strong quarter, Canaccord said in a note to clients as it kept its hold rating and raised its price target to $40 from $35. Between reporting underwhelming fiscal second-quarter results and giving a downbeat third-quarter view--including another big drop in gross margin--women's apparel retailer Bebe Stores Inc. (BEBE, $3.93, -$0.26, -6.10%) isn't liable to see much near-term improvement as new Chief Executive Steven Birkhold formulates a turnaround strategy. Brink's Co.'s (BCO, $26.64, -$3.18, -10.66%) fourth-quarter earnings missed Wall Street expectations as the security provider also announced a restructuring of its European operations. "Our recent results are far from satisfactory, and we continue to face challenges on several fronts," said Chief Executive Tom Schievelbein. Looking ahead, Brink's said it will be very difficult in 2013 to match 2012 earnings due in part to an increase in productivity investments. Carbo Ceramics Inc. (CRR, $86.57, +$6.46, +8.06%) reported higher-than-expected revenue and in-line per-share earnings for the fourth quarter. "The shift towards pad drilling by operators that care about their long-term well results bodes well for steadily increasing proppant volumes," said Global Hunter Securities in a note to clients, as it upgraded the maker of materials to tap shale plays to buy from neutral and raised its price target to $98 from $74. Chubb Corp.'s (CB, $84.12, +$3.81, +4.74%) fourth-quarter earnings declined 77% as hefty costs related to Hurricane Sandy weighed on the property and casualty insurer's results. Still, the company reported an operating profit, while analysts had projected an operating loss for the quarter, and Chubb also provided upbeat earnings guidance for the current year. Computer Programs & Systems Inc.'s (CPSI, $49.63, -$2.98, -5.66%) fourth-quarter earnings and revenue missed analysts' estimates as the health-care technology company also issued a disappointing 2013 outlook. In a note to clients, Lazard Capital Markets, which maintains its neutral rating, said the disappointing fourth-quarter results were due to the timing of the recognition of its contingent revenue. "While we do not yet know the reasons for the disappointing 2013 outlook, we have been indicating for some time that we believe growth outside the company's core community hospital base is limited," Lazard said. Eastman Chemical Co. (EMN, $73.70, +$2.55, +3.58%) swung to a fourth-quarter loss as the chemical and materials manufacturer recorded expenses related to asset impairments, restructuring and a recent acquisition. The company raised its 2013 adjusted earnings guidance. Echo Therapeutics Inc. (ECTE, $0.79, -$0.37, -31.49%) said its offering of 13.3 million shares priced at 75 cents apiece, a 35% discount to its Thursday closing price. The company, which is developing a needle-free glucose-monitoring system, had 44.5 million shares outstanding as of Wednesday. Harris Teeter Supermarkets Inc. (HTSI, $37.76, -$3.73, -8.99%) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings below analysts' estimates as the supermarket chain response to "aggressive pricing by competitors as well as low inflation and sluggish holiday sales (particularly Thanksgiving)," said BB&T in a note to clients, as it cut its rating to hold. Navios Maritime Partners LP's (NMM, $14.14, -$0.68, -4.60%) increased public offering of 4.5 million common units representing limited partnership interests priced at $14.15 a unit, a 4.5% discount to Thursday's close. The company, which owns and operates cargo vessels, had about 60.1 million units outstanding as of Dec. 31, 2012. NetSuite Inc.'s (N, $72.98, +$2.75, +3.92%) fourth-quarter loss narrowed as the maker of cloud software continued to report strong demand from its business customers. The results beat analyst expectations. Omnicell Inc.'s (OMCL, $17.16, +$1.36, +8.61%) fourth-quarter revenue came in higher than expected, while the provider of inventory management systems for hospitals and other health-care facilities also posted in-line per-share earnings. Product backlog as of Dec. 31 totaled $155 million, up $21 million, or 16%, from a year earlier. Perrigo Co.'s (PRGO, $106.14, +$5.63, +5.60%) fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 6.2% as the store-brand pharmaceutical and nutritional-products maker recorded strong revenue growth from its consumer health-care business, although margins narrowed as costs climbed. Perrigo revealed Friday it had agreed to buy pet-health company Velcera Inc. for $160 million in cash, a move the company billed as a "natural extension" to its Sergeant's Pet Care Products Inc. acquisition in October. Results came in ahead of expectations. PMC-Sierra Inc.'s (PMCS, $6.65, +$0.87, +15.05%) fourth-quarter profit fell 61% as the chip maker's revenue declined, though margins improved. Results topped analyst expectations. Reinsurance Group of America Inc.'s (RGA, $59.98, +$2.59, +4.51%) fourth-quarter profit rose 61% as the life reinsurer saw strong results from its North American businesses, and investment income jumped. Telecommunications Systems Inc.'s (TSYS, $2.40, +$0.14, +6.19%) fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat consensus estimates as the computer software company saw continued strong results from TotalCom government customer solutions, commercial 9-1-1 services revenue growth, sales of navigation technology into new markets and traction in monetizing the company's growing portfolio of protected intellectual property. Tellabs Inc. (TLAB, $2.12, -$0.17, -7.24%) reported its fourth-quarter loss widened as the networking-equipment company saw revenue decline across its segments and as it recorded restructuring-related charges. The company issued downbeat revenue guidance. Write to Anna Prior at anna.prior@dowjones.com Email

CAIRO--At least 29 people were killed, and another 649 injured in overnight clashes between supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi and the police forces across Egypt, official news agency MENA reported on Saturday, according to Xinhua News Agency. The governmental hospitals have received 21 dead bodies over clashes near the Nasr City's Rabaa al-Adaweya mosque in Cairo, head of Emergency Department of the Health Ministry, Khaled el-Khatib, was quoted by MENA as saying. Meanwhile, the ministry said a total of 29 people were killed, including 21 in Cairo and eight in Alexandria governorate, and 649 injured in clashes across the country, denying local media reports that governmental hospitals refused to receive the wounded. Earlier, however, Muslim Brotherhood said on its official website at least 120 people were killed and more 4,500 others wounded, most of them suffered gunshot wounds in confrontations between pro-Morsi protesters and security forces in the Naser street. It said most of the cases were shot in the head, neck and chest by snipers. Egyptian Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said late Friday that the massive sit-ins of supporters of Morsi will be cleared " soon and legally." "The residents around the Rabaa al-Adaweya Square in Cairo and Nahda Square near Cairo University in Giza filed complaints against the pro-Morsi protesters and the sit-ins will be cleared soon and legally," the minister told a local TV channel in a phone interview.

Ritchie Coster and Leon Addison Brown in 'The Train Driver.'
Richard Termine The Train Driver Romulus Linney Courtyard Theatre, Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 W. 42nd St. ($25), 212-244-7529, closes Sept. 23 New York Athol Fugard long ago chose to walk the shakiest of tightropes by writing artistically serious plays that directly reflected the stormy political life of South Africa, his native land. Now that apartheid is a thing of the past, it stands to reason that some of Mr. Fugard's earlier work should be looking a bit creaky, if for the best of reasons. But whenever he opts for dramatic poetry instead of tub-thumping, he shows how a gifted artist can write about politics without being devoured by them—and in "The Train Driver," his newest play, Mr. Fugard's poetic gifts prove to be as potently suggestive as ever. Like "Blood Knot," the 1961 play that first brought Mr. Fugard to the world's attention, "The Train Driver," which was inspired by a true story, is a two-man show whose characters meet in the middle of the racial gulf that continues to cleave the land in which they live. The setting is a squatter-camp graveyard where the unclaimed bodies of unidentified blacks are brought for burial. Simon (Leon Addison Brown), the resident gravedigger, is accosted one morning by Roelf (Ritchie Coster), a bedraggled, desperate-looking white railroad engineer. His presence in a place where "there is no white people sleeping" makes no sense to Simon. Soon, though, it emerges that Roelf has come there to search for the bodies of a black woman and her baby—and that he killed them, albeit accidentally, when the woman deliberately stepped in front of his train for reasons unknown. Mr. Fugard has said that "The Train Driver" is about "my own inherited blindness and guilt and all of what being a white South African in South Africa during [the] apartheid years meant." But to describe it in that way is to do a profound disservice to the subtlety with which he has enacted this anguished parable of despair and reconciliation. Except for one brief moment of near-sermonizing, Mr. Fugard lets his sad tale speak for itself. As always, he finds rough poetry in the plain speech of his characters, nowhere more so than in the clinching monologue in which Roelf explains why he is still haunted by the woman he killed: "Her darkness was somehow inside her and how the hell do you light candles there? When I think about that, when I try to imagine what that is like, I get frightened. Yes! Believe it or not but I still get scared of the dark." First performed in the U.S. two years ago at Hollywood's Fountain Theatre, one of this country's best small regional houses, "The Train Driver" is now being presented in New York as the final panel in the Signature Theatre Company's three-installment Fugard series. Mr. Fugard, who is also a first-rate director, has staged it with the unadorned clarity that he brought to the Signature's February revival of "Blood Knot," and Messrs. Brown and Coster are both extraordinarily fine. Christopher H. Barreca's eerie set, which looks like a junkyard on the far side of the moon, is as much a character in the play as are the members of the cast, and Barbara Rubin, the South African-born dialect coach, has helped the actors to inhabit their roles even more deeply than one would have thought possible. "The Train Driver" is first and foremost a piece of storytelling, with Roelf doing most of the talking. If you're in a hurry to get somewhere, you might well grow impatient with Mr. Fugard's patient pacing—so take a deep breath and listen more closely. This play is slow for a reason, and the payoff is more than worth the wait. Enlarge Image
Rob McClure in 'Chaplin.'
Joan Marcus Chaplin Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 W. 47th St. ($66.50-$135.50), 212-239-6200/ 800-432-7250 *** Rob McClure is arrestingly charismatic and vital in the title role of "Chaplin," the new Broadway musical about the life of the legendary silent-movie clown. If only the show were silent, too. Warren Carlyle, who choreographed last season's Broadway revival of "Follies," has staged "Chaplin" skillfully, while the black-and-white décor—sets by Beowulf Boritt, costumes by Amy Clark and Martin Pakledinaz—is as pleasing as the performances of Mr. McClure and his colleagues. No sooner do the characters open their mouths, though, than "Chaplin" becomes a bathetic, flashback-laden weeper about a misunderstood genius who never managed to get over his mother's descent into madness. Most of the blame attaches to Thomas Meehan, whose book descends to irredeemable banality ("Everybody wants to be me—except me") with the clockwork predictability of a bad biopic. As for Christopher Curtis's songs, let's just say that they go well with Mr. Meehan's book and leave it at that. —Mr. Teachout, the Journal's drama critic, blogs about theater and the other arts at www.terryteachout.com.

Can Britannica Rule the Web?
Despite Wikipedia, more people pay to access the encyclopedia website annually than paid for the print edition in any year. By
L. Gordon Crovitz
Updated March 18, 2012 11:37 p.m. ET
How would you have written the encyclopedia entry about last week's news that the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which was first published in 1768, has stopped putting out a printed version? The media naturally focused on this fact alone—the loss of the printed volume. The more interesting story is whether Britannica can survive online. Those of us who grew up with the leather volumes tend toward nostalgia. In the pre-digital era, Britannica was the definitive way to impart and search information. The surprise is that for many...

The Freezer Down Below
A century after the first successful expedition to the South Pole, Antarctica remains the most aloof and inhospitable continent By
Gabrielle Walker
Dec. 28, 2012 7:47 p.m. ET
Over Christmas, a British scientific team had to give up its mission to drill beneath an ancient Antarctic lake, searching for minute forms of life. The researchers were done in by equipment failures and lack of fuel. When it comes to human existence on the frozen continent, everything always hangs by a thread. A hundred years ago, what was then the world's most famous race had just run its murderous course in Antarctica. Roald Amundsen, the first man to reach the South Pole, had returned to civilization and was giving...

RBS Considering Investment Bank Split
By
Max Colchester
Updated Jan. 21, 2013 3:35 p.m. ET
LONDON—Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC is considering splitting its investment bank into two separate divisions, according to a person briefed on internal discussions at the lender. The split could happen if John Hourican, the head of RBS's investment bank, leaves the partly state-owned bank when it settles with the U.K.'s Financial Services Authority over allegations that it attempted to rig several rates, including the London...

WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration said it would lend $17.4 billion to General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC, buying them a few weeks of financial relief but leaving the biggest decisions about the industry's future to President-elect Barack Obama. Under the White House plan, the companies are required to extract enough financial concessions from workers, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders to demonstrate their long-term viability by the end of March. Enlarge Image
President George W. Bush makes comments on the auto industry Friday morning.
Associated Press The deal's ambitious targets for the companies include replacing two-thirds of their debt with stock; using more stock instead of cash to fund retiree health-care obligations; eliminating much-criticized union "jobs banks" that pay laid-off auto workers; and establishing wage structures and workplace rules that are more competitive with foreign rivals. But all those targets are nonbinding, and the agreement appeared to be much more porous than legislation that the administration and Democratic congressional leaders failed to pass earlier this month. The loan package also requires the administration to drain what remains in the first half of the Treasury Department's $700 billion bailout fund, originally intended to aid the financial industry. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
said lawmakers should release the final $350 billion "to support financial-market stability," a request likely to set up another battle with Congress. Investors cheered the auto rescue, with GM shares climbing almost 23%, or 83 cents, to $4.49 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange trading. Ford Motor Co.

-- which is in better financial health and isn't seeking immediate aid -- saw a more modest gain of about 4%, or 11 cents, to close at $2.95. Chrysler isn't publicly traded, but private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LLC, which owns a majority of the auto maker, said in a statement it is pleased with the White House's move, and believes it will lead "to the restructuring of Chrysler automotive's debt and labor agreements." But the bailout is just the first step in what could be a long and painful revamping of the three Detroit companies during a recession. The loans may not keep them out of bankruptcy court in the long run as U.S. car sales have plunged to 1982 levels, consumer spending has fallen and buyers continue to have trouble obtaining vehicle financing. In a note to clients, J.P. Morgan auto analyst Himanshu Patel
said the Treasury Department's plan has a "nebulous threshold for determining viability by March 31," and he believes this "gray language could just as easily be used by the next administration to justify forcing a car maker into bankruptcy" or liquidation. He said of the three Detroit auto makers, Chrysler appears the most likely candidate for a near-term bankruptcy. Helping HandUnder the White House plan, U.S. auto makers would: Receive $13.4 billion in short-term loans from TARP, the financial-industry rescue fund Receive $4 billion more in February, contingent on congressional approval Need to prove they are viable by March 31 or be required to return the funds Provide the government with warrants for nonvoting stock The deal adds the two storied Detroit giants to the long list of prominent American corporate names to receive federal bailouts in recent weeks -- and comes nearly 30 years after Chrysler once before was propped up by Washington. The auto agreement provides the government with nonvoting stock warrants in GM and Chrysler, adding those ownership stakes to the government's rapidly expanding portfolio that includes much of the American banking industry, American International Group Inc.,

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The deal's generous terms in the short run reflect the precarious state of the U.S. and global economies and a U.S. government caught between two administrations -- as well as outgoing President George W. Bush's worries about the risk of deepening the downturn in the final days of his administration. More Bush's Remarks on the Auto Rescue Ford Will Benefit From Bailout Car Makers Face Wrenching Change Rescue Won't Spark Sales, Dealers Warn Real Time Econ: Lame Duck Demands Bailout package fact sheet Term Sheets: Chrysler | GM Statements: General Motors, Chrysler, Ford | Cerberus Chrysler Memo: Nardelli Calls for Concession Talks Complete coverage: Detroit in Crisis Speaking from the White House at 9 a.m., Mr. Bush said the administration decided against forcing a bankruptcy to compel cost-cutting, fearing consumers might desert one or more of the car companies and touch off a broader collapse. Executives of the car makers have made similar arguments. "Under ordinary economic circumstances, I would say this is the price that failed companies must pay, and I would not favor intervening to prevent the auto makers from going out of business," the president said. "But these are not ordinary circumstances. In the midst of a financial crisis and a recession, allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action." In essence, Mr. Bush's plan lets the auto companies survive through March. He leaves it to the Obama administration to decide many tough questions after that. Obama officials must wrestle with how much in wage and benefit concessions to demand from the United Auto Workers union, which strongly backed Mr. Obama's campaign and helped him carry Michigan over Republican rival John McCain
; how to wring savings from the companies' politically powerful dealerships; and what concessions can be squeezed from debt holders, suppliers and other groups. Mr. Obama and his aides on Friday were generally supportive of the White House approach, especially the decision to avoid a bankruptcy filing. At a press conference, Mr. Obama warned Detroit executives that "the American people's patience is running out" and said the companies must use this opportunity to chart a course for their companies "that is sustainable." He also declined to say the White House is asking too much of the UAW. While workers shouldn't bear the entire burden of the restructuring, he said, "there are going to be some painful steps that have to be taken." UAW leaders and their congressional allies were already signaling Friday that they would seek to ease the terms of the deal next year as they expect more friends on Capitol Hill and in the White House. Top Democratic leaders complained about the administration's aim of reducing worker wages and benefits. Rep. Barney Frank
(D., Mass.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, termed the provisions "an unfair assault on working men and women." Friday's deal, which resulted from negotiations between the administration and the two companies that lasted most of Thursday night, would extend a total $13.4 billion in loans to the two companies in December and January, with another $4 billion likely available in February. GM would get a total of $13.4 billion, and Chrysler, $4 billion. The Bush administration agreed to tap the remaining financial-industry aid after it failed to win congressional approval to use a $25 billion program that was designed to help the domestic auto makers retool to make more environmentally friendly vehicles. At both GM and Chrysler, the announcement of the loans and the government's conditions set off a race to rework agreements and contracts with the UAW, banks, creditors, suppliers and dealers. "We know we have a lot of work ahead of us," GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner
said at a press conference. The crisis, he added, has focused GM on "once and for all" addressing problems that built up over decades. But the pact gives the companies leeway, even if they don't obtain all the concessions they are seeking. The deal generally tracks key provisions of the bailout legislation that nearly passed Congress. But it provides significant flexibility to the companies in how they prove "viability." And according to a White House fact sheet, the cost-cutting targets "would be nonbinding in the sense that negotiations can deviate from the quantitative targets ... providing that the [company] reports the reasons for these deviations and makes the business case to achieve long-term viability in spite of the deviations." The agreement also lacks another key provision that the legislation contained: a ban on further federal aid if the companies failed to show they were taking sufficient steps to become viable. The new deal threatens only to call back existing loans if the companies fail to demonstrate viability by March 31. Along with loans from the government, Chrysler is now in line to get additional help from its finance unit. Cerberus, which owns 80.1% of Chrysler, had come under pressure to put more money into the auto maker. After the White House announced the loans, Cerberus said it would put the first $2 billion in profits or dividends it makes on Chrysler Financial, which it also controls, into the auto operations. It didn't say when that would happen. Enlarge Image

But they are expected to get money from the Treasury rescue fund as well, people familiar with the situation said. Restoring the financing arms to health is key to sustaining sales for the companies. The financing operations also will be important elements in any mergers the companies attempt as part of their restructurings. Now that GM's short-term liquidity issues are addressed, Mr. Wagoner said a key priority for the auto maker is ensuring the health of GMAC, co-owned by GM and Cerberus. GMAC, a vital cog in GM's retail network, is teetering on the brink of collapse as it works to restructure its debt and obtain bank-holding status from the government in order to tap the financial-industry bailout funds. Reflecting the ongoing struggles of the industry, Chrysler separately announced Friday the departure of two more top executives. Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Meyer
is leaving the company immediately to pursue "other opportunities," and Philip F. Murtaugh,
who headed its Asia operations, will leave at the end of the month. Their exits come after unexpected departures by two other senior managers -- purchasing chief John Campi,
who left last week, and Simon Boag,
head of Chrysler's Mopar parts and accessories business, who left earlier this week. —Sharon Terlep, Alex P. Kellogg and Elizabeth Williamson contributed to this article. View Graphics
