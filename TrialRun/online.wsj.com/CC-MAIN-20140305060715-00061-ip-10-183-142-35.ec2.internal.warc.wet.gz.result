Twitter Mirror, nueva arma de publicidad de las celebridades

Por KATHERINE ROSMAN
CONNECTTomar fotos auténticas y espontáneas de celebridades no es una tarea simple, pero ahora existe Twitter Mirror, una herramienta que se coloca detrás de los escenarios en entregas de premios y en los camerinos de programas de entrevistas para que los propios famosos lo hagan.Mirror es el nombre que Twitter Inc. le ha dado a una tableta programada para eventos especiales y adornada con un marco con filigrana, como el de un espejo elegante. Las celebridades se paran en frente, tocan la pantalla, se toman su tiempo para posar, aprueban la foto o la vuelven a tomar y la envían a través de la cuenta en Twitter del evento. "Nuestro trabajo es hacer que todos los que están en casa en Twitter digan, 'Dios mío, ver televisión con Twitter es muy divertido'", dice Fred Graver, director de televisión de la compañía de microblogueo.
Desde hace meses, ejecutivos de Twitter se han estado reuniendo con productores de televisión para hablar sobre el uso del Mirror como una herramienta de promoción en tiempo real para sus programas. "Estamos tratando de darles una impresionante vista de lo que ocurre a continuación y lo que las personas están haciendo fuera de cámara", explica Graver.
Cada ceremonia de premiación quiere superar a la anterior. Después de que en febrero los Grammy utilizaran un Mirror detrás del escenario, los Oscar hicieron lo propio dos semanas después. Los American Music Awards lo usaron en noviembre para capturar imágenes de 360 grados. Con eventos de alfombra roja en el horizonte, como los espectáculos de Año Nuevo y los Globos de Oro, Instagram y su propietario, Facebook, también están probando este nuevo tipo de promoción.En los últimos años, muchas cuentas en Twitter de celebridades se han transformado de canales sin editar a máquinas de marketing profesionales. Los empleados de Twitter dicen que el "espejo" le permite al público ingresar a lugares exclusivos para ver a los famosos en momentos más espontáneos.
El Mirror facilita que las celebridades se promocionen a sí mismas, así como el programa en el que parecen, añadiendo hashtags a la imagen. "Las fotos del Mirror son un contraste con las que toman los paparazzi en la alfombra roja, que son coreografiadas y repetitivas", dice Andrew McClain, el empleado de Twitter que supervisa el Mirror.
En noviembre, la empresa envió un equipo al estudio del programa de entrevistas Jimmy Kimmel Live, en Los Ángeles, para instalar en el camerino el primer Twitter Mirror permanente. Los invitados que aparecen en el programa pueden tomar un autorretrato y mandarlo a los 377.000 seguidores del show en Twitter.

El Twitter Mirror en la alfombra roja de los American Music Awards este año.
Durante los Oscar de este año, Donna Karan y Barbra Streisand posaron juntas en un Mirror en el camerino. Aparte de las estrellas en primer plano, la imagen tiene la calidad de una foto tomada por un aficionado con un teléfono: no está bien iluminada y un mesero de aspecto cansado se alcanza a ver en el fondo.
Twitter Mirror también se ha usado en América Latina, particularmente en Rock in Rio, en septiembre, donde se instalaron dos "espejos", uno en una sala VIP y otro detrás del escenario. Artistas como John Mayer mandaron fotos a través de la cuenta del festival de rock.
Facebook también tiene una iniciativa para presentar a los famosos de forma más cándida: la serie #dayinthelife, en la que famosos relatan su día en Facebook e Instagram. Durante los MTV Video Music Awards en agosto, Miley Cyrus participó. "Cuando uno ve una imagen de Sofía Vergara en Instagram mientras se alista para una entrega de premios, definitivamente va a ser un recordatorio de que el show es esa noche", señala Charles Porch, director de alianzas estratégicas de Facebook para la música y el entretenimiento. El Mirror nació en enero, cuando los empleados de Twitter Jenna Mannos, James Buckhouse y McClain se reunieron durante Hack Week, un concurso interno de la empresa. Basado en el uso de una cámara dentro de una piscina que tuiteó imágenes durante los Juegos Olímpicos de 2012 en Londres, Mannos tuvo la idea de un aparato que tomara fotos tras bambalinas durante la Semana de la Moda en Nueva York.
A partir de ahí, el trío creó el "espejo", cuya función fue diseñada por McClain. Cada marco decorativo está hecho a medida para adaptarse al ambiente del evento o programa. McClain trabaja ahora de tiempo completo en el proyecto y siempre trata de generar ideas con los productores para dar con nuevas formas de usarlo. Fue también el encargado de supervisar el Mirror detrás del escenario en los Grammy y en los premios Tony, en los que ayudó a atraer a las celebridades. "Me costó mucho persuadir a Tom Hanks para que usara el Mirror durante los Tony, ya que él quería tomar sus propias fotos detrás del escenario", dice.

Portland, Ore. A recent best-selling album and a recent best-selling children's book have two things in common. Their words and drawings were created by the same husband-and-wife team, and they were both inspired by where the couple lives: a steep, windy, densely foliaged neighborhood across from a dark forest of ivy-covered trees filled with coyotes and owls. Photos: A Home in the Urban Wild
View Slideshow
Chris Mueller for The Wall Street Journal Colin Meloy, lead singer and songwriter for indie rock band the Decemberists, his wife, illustrator Carson Ellis, and their 5-year-old son live right across from Portland's 5,000-acre Forest Park. These woods infuse the lyrics of many of the Decemberists' songs; "The King Is Dead," their sixth album featuring a silhouette of the forest designed by Ms. Ellis, debuted at the top spot on the Billboard 200 chart in February. The couple's first book, "Wildwood," named after the longest of Forest Park's trails, made the top 10 of the New York Times children's chapter book best-seller list last week, and has been optioned for a film by Laika, the animation studio that made "Coraline." In the book, a girl's baby brother is kidnapped by crows and taken to the "Impassable Wilderness." Although the couple live amongst a handful of homes not far from downtown Portland, it feels they are in the wild because of all the trees. "A lot of what I've written has been inspired by living in this house, being freed of a neighborhood, with the wilderness across the street," said Mr. Meloy, 36, who has a full beard and black-rimmed glasses. Ms. Ellis, 35, with red hair and sharp cheekbones, half-jokingly refers to their location as survivalist's paradise—a place where they could live on their own vegetables and fruit, drink water from the creeks and hunt meat in a post-apocalyptic scenario. Built in 1928, their 2,000-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath house is like many of Ms. Ellis's illustrations: retro, picture-book sweet with lots of character. It's set on a sloping lawn with a vegetable garden out back and a kid's bicycle and rubber boots on the front stoop. The couple has kept the interior sparse; the furniture is a mixture of IKEA sofas, wooden tables they either made themselves or had custom made and sheepskin rugs. In the living room is a black Eames chair, a set of cubbies with a vinyl record collection and a record player. The room for their son Hank has a 4-foot wide sculpture of a moon, made by artist Jesse Durost. In back of the house, past an outdoor patio with a long wooden table and stairs up to the garden flanked by plum trees, is a detached garage that the couple turned into dual studios. Mr. Meloy calls his a man cave, stocking it with a leather sofa, a wine rack loaded with vintages from Côtes du Rhônes and lots of musical instruments. On his desk are two wood blocks, one saying "First Thought" and the other saying "Best Thought"—Allen Ginsberg's governing principle that Mr. Meloy uses to keep himself writing. Upstairs, Ms. Ellis's office is cozier, with a sloped roof, skylights and a long wood table she made for her drawing space. She has worked on a number of children's books, including those by authors Lemony Snicket and Trenton Lee Stewart. They collaborate: Mr. Meloy always has a say about the Decemberists' album covers, and he often runs lyrics by his wife. Working together on "Wildwood" meant lots of crossover between upstairs and downstairs. Mr. Meloy would plan the plot; Ms. Ellis would run her preliminary drawings past him. Sometimes their physical proximity can be a problem. Mr. Meloy likes "weird ambient" music, Pandora radio or silence when he works; Ms. Ellis at times blasts Kanye West. "I get a lot of old man texts that say 'turn that rap down'," said Ms. Ellis. Mr. Meloy grew up in Helena, Mont., and spent summers with his uncle in Oregon. He started college at the University of Oregon but transferred to the University of Montana to study writing, where he met Ms. Ellis, who was in Missoula getting a degree in painting. After graduation, Mr. Meloy returned to Oregon in 1999, playing at first on his own at small bars in Portland and then starting the Decemberists with a group of friends in 2000. The band released its first album "5 Songs" in 2001, followed by "Her Majesty" in 2003 and its breakthrough album "Picaresque" in 2005. Mr. Meloy and Ms. Ellis first lived in a house in the city's Northeast section. But after many walks in Forest Park, they decided they wanted to be nearer to the woods and farther from people. He found the changing seasons in their forest walks inspiring. They bought their current house, already renovated, in 2008 for $475,000. A four-bedroom, three-bath home twice the size nearby is for sale for $499,000. The house is smaller than they'd wanted, and limited storage means Mr. Meloy has to rein in his penchant for accumulation, particularly of kitchen gadgets (waffle maker, panini maker, rice maker). Still, they have no plans to move. "We like to keep our footprint small," said Mr. Meloy. Write to Nancy Keates at nancy.keates@wsj.com Email

The widely criticized new version of the U.S. psychiatric diagnostic manual released Friday faces a potentially diminished role in research, which would mark a shift for what has been considered the bible of American psychiatry for 30 years. This fifth revision of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM-5, represents the first major overhaul of the book in nearly 20 years. Changing Diagnoses in the DSM Take a look back over some of the language that has been used in the DSM to describe certain diagnoses and how it has changed.

More photos and interactive graphics Criticism of the years-long revision process has been fierce. Some experts have accused the DSM task force of making too many major changes with limited research evidence, such as eliminating Asperger's syndrome as a stand-alone diagnosis and subsuming it under an autism-spectrum disorder label. Others have charged the opposite—the new manual won't be different enough from the previous edition. The manual is expected to include some 160 disorders, roughly the same number as in the previous edition, but with the diagnostic categories "sliced" differently than before, said Jeffrey Lieberman,
president-elect of the American Psychiatric Association. The marked disagreement over the DSM revision underscores the broader challenge in mental health: how to develop better ways to diagnose and treat conditions that are based on subjective symptoms with relatively limited tools and insight into the abnormalities in the brain. The new edition of the DSM will be the first to be updated electronically and is designed to be a "living document" that can take into account emerging science, though the details for updating the manual haven't been worked out yet, according to David Kupfer,
head of the DSM task force that oversaw the revision. The DSM, launched in 1952, classifies disorders into categories using behaviors that are considered defining of the conditions. In the past three decades, the manual has been used not only to diagnose patients, but also to select participants with particular disorders for research studies. The manual's classification system also has been a major factor in decisions involving grant funding and scientific publications. In addition, health insurers utilize it for billing purposes and the Food and Drug Administration uses it as a guide for drug approvals. Some in the field have been frustrated by the classification system, which focuses on behavioral symptoms and not on chemical changes or brain abnormalities. Some experts believe that studying the behaviors or biological changes that cut across multiple disorders is a way to accelerate research progress. The DSM is supposed to reflect the current knowledge in the field and some of the latest research is too new to use as a basis for changing the framework of how mental illness is diagnosed, say DSM leaders. DSM leaders and other experts now say the manual should primarily be used for clinical care, not to steer the research agenda. "The DSM is the best we've got for clinical care," said Thomas Insel,
head of the National Institute of Mental Health. "It's no longer the best guide for research. We're at a point now we're ready to go to the next step." Dr. Kupfer, the DSM leader, said researchers should look at the DSM as "a guide but not necessarily the only framework they should use to carry out basic science." For the DSM to be considered primarily a guide for clinicians is a "dramatic backtracking from their prior position as putting themselves out there as the best basis for research," said Geoffrey Reed,
senior project officer at the World Health Organization who is helping to lead the revision of the mental and behavioral disorders section of the International Classification of Diseases, or ICD, the World Health Organization's standard diagnostic tool. Most of the research funded by the NIMH and published in psychiatry journals in the past 20-plus years had to use DSM diagnostic criteria; otherwise, scientists had no hope of publishing, said Dr. Reed. One alternative is a proposal that the NIMH has been developing for three years, called the Research Domain Criteria, which will move toward funding research that examines core biological features of illness shared by several disorders, such as problems in brain circuitry, rather than the current practice of focusing on symptoms specific to one disorder, according to Dr. Insel. There still is a need for scientists and clinicians to speak a common language in order to carry out clinical research, and the role of the DSM in aiding this communication won't change in the near future, said Dianne Chambless,
a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies anxiety treatment. But new knowledge identifying underlying biological processes or behaviors could be beneficial to clinicians, as well, she said. "The important thing is for science to be cumulative," said Dr. Chambless. Write to Shirley S. Wang at shirley.wang@wsj.com Email

Biography
Sept. 3, 2013 7:12 p.m. ET
Fashion model Jourdan Dunn,
23 years old, said she wasn't expecting the reaction she got from a tweet she sent earlier this summer. Ms. Dunn, who has about 107,000 followers on Twitter, posted, (with some creative grammar): "Ahahahahahaha I just for canceled from Dior because of my boobs! I❤ fashion #Couture." Models Take to Social Media
View Slideshow
Cara Delevingne modeled a look in Oscar de la Renta's Fall 2013 show.
Oscar de la Renta Models, paid to be expressionless, are finding a new way to express themselves. Social media is also giving brands that select models for lucrative marketing contracts a way to gauge their influence—and to see who is witty, wild or a bit of a loose cannon. As hundreds of models arrive for New York Fashion Week, which starts Thursday, their Twitter followers will get virtual front-row seats to the world of high fashion. Ms. Dunn's Dior post was retweeted and picked up by fashion blogs. New York magazine's lifestyle blog The Cut's headline read "Jourdan Dunn's Breasts 'Too Big' For Dior Couture.
" Soon Us Weekly and E! weighed in and media commentators used the opportunity to talk about models and body size. Jourdan Dunn has about 218,200 Instagram followers and is known for her sometimes provocative tweets.
"My agency was screaming. They didn't know how Dior would react," said Ms. Dunn, who pronounces her first name Joor-DAHN, in a recent telephone interview from London. "They said you don't want to upset the client." (Her agency, Women Management, declined to comment. Dior declined to comment.) Runway models, long cast as expressionless figures showcasing Fashion Week's finest wears, are finding their own voice on social media. Sometimes that can land them big endorsement deals. Or, it can backfire. Leslie Yazel explains. Photo: facebook.com/officialKateUpton.
Ms. Dunn's Twitter feed is often jokey and ribald: "I'm trying this new thing [where] I have green tea in the morning instead of a good brew." Moments later she tweeted, "It's bloody horrible," adding three disgusted faces. She has also weighed in on issues such as race: In February, Ms. Dunn, a black West Indian, tweeted: "This industry is NOT a walk in a park for black models and even when you make it they will always make you feel like you should be grateful." Ms. Dunn said while she doesn't regret anything she has posted on social media, "maybe I shouldn't have brought attention to Dior." Social media is "all about branding. People will forget about your talent and talk about your tweets. I feel you have to be careful." Stephan Moskovic, co-founder and editor of Models.com, a website that ranks models, said, "It can be a big plus for a brand if they sign up a model that has a large following." Models.com began running models' latest tweets on the models' profile pages at the end of last year. "When you walk into a brand and you say 'what about her, what about him?' they now ask 'how many followers do they have?' " said Ivan Bart,
senior vice president and managing director of IMG Models. The agency represents Joan Smalls
and Karlie Kloss,
the No. 1 and No. 9 runway models as ranked by Models.com, as well as Kate Upton,
who appeared two years in a row on the cover of Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue. "When you want a spokesperson or face of your brand, you want to know they will sell the brand," he added. "Are they connecting, are they relevant, who are they relevant to? We have that information now," said Mr. Bart. Karlie Kloss has about 245,900 followers on Twitter and 342,500 on Instagram.
Michael Kors The agency has been encouraging and training its new models to use social media, Mr. Bart said. In the past year or so, models including Cara Delevingne
and Ms. Smalls have taken followers with them from show to show, chronicling their commutes, their hair and makeup preparation sessions, and giving hints of what they'll be wearing down the runway. Some also tweet a lot about food. And there are at least two Twitter accounts dedicated to Ms. Delevingne's signature, thick eyebrows. Ms. Delevingne, who has about 2.4 million Instagram followers, appears in a DKNY print ad standing atop a taxi. The brand says it considers the model's social-media profile a bonus factor. "Cara has the same energy and spirit that DKNY embodies. Her dynamic personality comes through in her pictures and her social presence is simply another way that she shares it," said Patti Cohen, executive vice president for global marketing and communications at Donna Karan Co. At the Society Management, Elite World's New York division, marketing coordinator Vicky Yang,
advises models on their social media activities and created written guidelines. These include backstage etiquette: "We encourage them not to share too much backstage," out of respect to the design house, Ms. Yang said. Ms. Yang asks models to consider if what they're posting is something they'd regret 20 years from now. The firm also encourages models to post about their nonwork interests, too, so that they are "not just mannequins and they potentially reach an even vaster audience than just followers of fashion or modeling," said Ms. Yang. The agency represents model Liu Wen
—the first Asian model to be a face of Estée Lauder Cos. cosmetics, who has more than 100,000 followers on Instagram. Ms. Liu, who is Chinese, also has a large following on Weibo, a social media site in China, making her more attractive to brands who want to reach Chinese consumers. "I think a great part my current success was due to my presence on social media," she said via email. Model Coco Rocha,
widely considered a social media pioneer among models, said she is glad to see more models using Twitter and the like. "Celebrities have taken so many of our jobs. Now you can see how many people are following a model. It means something to a company." Roman Young,
director of women and image at Wilhelmina International, and one of Ms. Rocha's agents, said "five or 10 years ago, models were only judged on their looks or if they were cool on set. Now you can find out how cool they are from social media. So [brands] can find a model that fits their brand in a very real way. They don't have to fake it." Joan Smalls for Estée Lauder
Estee Lauder For Ms. Smalls, social media "gives us our platform. The world is getting to know the model's personality through the way they look at life." The surge of models on social media coincides with what some are calling the return of the supermodel ideal of the late 1980s and early '90s, embodied by models with outsized personalities and antics, such as Naomi Campbell
and Linda Evangelista.
More recently, runway models were more seen than heard and magazine covers used actresses and celebrities on their covers. In the past year, three of this new generation of runway models have appeared on the cover of W, while Vogue and Elle put Ms. Upton on magazine covers this year. Interview magazine devoted its September issue to supermodels. James Scully,
a casting director for runway shows, says the fashion runways are slowly starting to use models with more personality, which he endorses. While Ms. Dunn doesn't like the word supermodel, she said, "The models of this generation have more personality. People are seeing that." Write to Ray A. Smith at ray.smith@wsj.com Email
