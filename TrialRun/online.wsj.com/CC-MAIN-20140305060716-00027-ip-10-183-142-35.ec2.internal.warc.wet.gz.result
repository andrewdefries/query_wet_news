As U.S. Moves Toward Brink of Default, Lawmakers Host Dinners, Golf Outings
By
Brody Mullins
July 29, 2011
The federal government may be strapped for cash, but lawmakers are making sure they aren't caught short. Congressmen are hosting hundreds of fund-raising events in the weeks surrounding the deficit fight, including some tied specifically to the battle over the debt ceiling, as their continued wrangling pushes the world's most powerful nation...

Updated Sept. 20, 2008 5:56 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON -- President Bush spoke with new candor on Saturday about the panic that administration officials feared was about to seize up the nation's credit system and the broader economy last week. Mr. Bush also looked ahead to the upcoming negotiations with Congress over the big financial rescue plan his administration is proposing. In his comments to reporters, Mr. Bush didn't specifically rule out additional measures that some Democrats want to include in the plan. But the president emphasized the need to pass the package quickly in order to reassure markets. Aides rejected the idea that he was opening the door to more assistance, saying it's too early to discuss such specifics. Democrats have floated the idea of targeting some aid to homeowners who are struggling with their mortgages, among other suggestions for additional middle-class relief. "We're going to work with Congress to get a bill done quickly," Mr. Bush said in response to a reporter's question about possible add-ons. "It is essential the package be robust and strong to address the problem... We'll work to get something done as quickly and as big as possible." At another point, he added that most congressional leaders "would understand we need to get this done quickly -- the cleaner the better." Mr. Bush's comments came in a joint Rose Garden appearance with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe. After the government intervened over the last two weeks to shore up individual institutions such as government-sponsored mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as insurance giant American International Group Inc., Mr. Bush said officials finally realized in recent days that "the house of cards was much bigger" than just the mortgage-finance system, or even Wall Street. He added that "when one card started to go, we worried about the whole deck going down, so therefore moved, and moved hard" in proposing the rescue plan. "I believe this is going to work," he said. The administration's plan entails a new program to buy up unmarketable financial assets such as troubled mortgage-backed securities, thereby relieving institutions of a burden that had threatened to freeze credit markets, and even block availability of ordinary consumer loans and money-market funds. Mr. Bush defended the government's proposed intervention -- estimated to carry an up-front price tag of $700 billion -- as necessary to deal with the emerging problem. "This is a big price tag because it's a big problem," Mr. Bush said. "I told my people, 'I don't want to be timid in the face of a significant problem that'll affect the average citizen.'" He added that the problem "wasn't going to be contained to just the financial community....This is Wall Street plus Main Street and I'm worried about Main Street." He held out the prospect that many of the assets will prove to be valuable. "I believe, when it's all said and done... that the taxpayer is going to get a lot of that money back," he said. But he acknowledged that some conservatives are disappointed the administration is intervening in financial markets on such a scale. "My first instinct wasn't to lay out a huge government plan," he admitted. "My first instinct was to let the market work, until I realized upon being briefed by the experts of how significant this problem became. And so I decided to act and act boldly." Write to John D.
