Cambodia's Dangerous Transparency Problem
Public disclosure in Cambodian factories can help ensure workers aren't putting their lives at risk.
By
Jill Tucker
Sept. 23, 2013 12:21 p.m. ET
This year was a particularly hazardous one for workers in the global garment industry. From the ashes of factory fires and the rubble of the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh come a set of familiar and vexing questions: How to make factory conditions safer for workers, and who is responsible? One answer to these questions can be glimpsed in another, more hopeful recent event. Earlier this year, the owner of the Kingsland Garment Factory in Cambodia shuttered the premises and fled the country without notice—and without...

Bernanke's Straightforward Message Gets Lost in Market's Translation
By
Jon Hilsenrath
May 23, 2013 8:22 p.m. ET
The Federal Reserve is having some trouble explaining itself. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress on Wednesday that the central bank could start reducing its $85 billion-per-month bond-buying program at one of its "next few meetings" and cautioned that he was reluctant to move aggressively or prematurely. That straightforward message, however, has been muddled by a number of other signals sent by the Fed and Mr....

BEIJING—New Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pledged to slash bureaucracy and continue market-oriented overhauls while boosting social spending and fighting pollution, but he gave few specifics about how he plans to carry out those goals. In his first news conference, Mr. Li said on Sunday that China will rely on the continued migration of its people to cities to boost domestic consumption, and so remake the country's economy into one less...

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at right, speaks with President Barack Obama in Tel Aviv after his arrival in Israel on Wednesday.
Getty Images JERUSALEM—President Barack Obama
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
exchanged hearty back pats, smiles and jokes as they sought to showcase a mended relationship on the first day of a visit by the American president. During a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Barack Obama affirms the U.S.'s commitment to Israel's security in the face of many challenges.
The displays of newfound warmth extended to closer public agreement on the most pressing issue they discussed, Iran. After openly clashing during Mr. Obama's first term on how best to curb Iran's nuclear program, the two leaders closed ranks Wednesday, hours after Mr. Obama arrived for his first visit to the country as president. Mr. Netanyahu issued his clearest threat yet to bomb Iran, citing assurances from Mr. Obama that Israel has a right to defend itself. At a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Barack Obama discusses the strong partnership between the U.S. and Israel.
"Israel can never cede the right to defend ourselves to others, even to the greatest of our friends," Mr. Netanyahu said at a joint news conference at his Jerusalem residence. "There is not a lot of daylight between our countries' assessments in terms of where Iran is right now," Mr. Obama said. The two men said there was little difference between their timelines for Iran's nuclear program, which both countries believe is aimed at building an atomic bomb, despite Iran's denials. Officials with Iran's United Nations mission didn't return a call seeking comment on Wednesday. More Pitching Friendship to a Tough Audience Mr. Obama said each country needs to make its own decision to engage in military action. In turn, Mr. Netanyahu endorsed Mr. Obama's handling of the Iran issue, sidestepping a history of public criticism. "I am absolutely convinced the president is determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons," Mr. Netanyahu said. The comments came at the end of day one of Mr. Obama's first visit to Israel as president and the first foreign trip of his second term. Both leaders recently won re-election campaigns and appeared determined to show the public they have put old grudges aside. "Peace" and "friendship" were oft-repeated on the first day of President Obama's trip to Israel. But, as Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Idyck tells The News Hub, Obama's visit may be poorly timed.
Both leaders had faced domestic criticism for letting the relationship sour. Israeli officials publicly declared warm U.S. relations to be vital to national security. For the U.S., rocky relations complicated Mr. Obama's efforts to convince Israel to advance the peace process. Throughout the day, Mr. Obama struck themes aimed at winning Israeli hearts and minds. He began his opening statement on the tarmac of Ben Gurion Airport speaking in Hebrew. He emphasized the Jewish people's 3,000-year-old connection to the land of Israel and used terminology, biblical references and turns of phrase similar to those used by ardent Zionists. In his opening speech, he made no mention of the Palestinian conflict. Washington Wire Live Blog: Obama-Netanyahu Press Conference Transcript of Obama's Remarks at Arrival in Israel Obama Caught on Open Mic: 'Good to Get Away From Congress' In doing so, Mr. Obama appeared to have taken to heart criticism leveled at him by many Israelis after his 2009 speech in Cairo, in which he seemed to suggest that Israel's legitimacy was as a haven for Jews fleeing the Holocaust, instead of in Jews' ancient ties to the land itself. During their joint news conference, Messrs. Netanyahu and Obama nodded while the other spoke, lingered during handshakes and embraces, and gently ribbed each other.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed President Obama in Tel Aviv.
Associated Press "Everything is warm and cuddly," said a senior Israeli official. "There is apparently a tacit agreement between both leaders, if not coordination, to engage in very intense PDA," or public displays of affection. Mr. Obama's standing among Palestinians appeared to fall as he moved to patch up his relationship with Israel. Many protested his overtures to the Israelis. "Palestinians have realized Obama is just like every other U.S. president and is never going to take on Israel," said Diana Buttu,
a former adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Mr. Obama was set to travel to Ramallah on Thursday to meet Mr. Abbas, before returning to Jerusalem for a speech that White House officials billed as the centerpiece of his visit. On Wednesday, protesters in Ramallah tried to march on the headquarters of Mr. Abbas and scuffled with Palestinian police. Posters in Ramallah with Mr. Obama's face on them were defaced.

Yet Secretary of State John Kerry
arrived in Israel two days ahead of Mr. Obama. On the eve of Mr. Obama's arrival, Mr. Kerry met with Isaac Molho,
an aide to Mr. Netanyahu in charge of the peace process for the Israeli leader. Mr. Kerry is scheduled to travel to Jordan with Mr. Obama on Friday, and back to Jerusalem Saturday to meet again with Mr. Netanyahu to discuss the peace process, according to a senior Israeli official. "He is trying some sort of shuttle diplomacy," said the official. —Adam Entous contributed to this article.

NYSE Takes Steps To Refill Showroom By
Jacob Bunge
Updated Feb. 6, 2013 5:23 p.m. ET
Investors shopping for stock deals are doing more of their business directly through platforms run by banks and brokers, leaving the showrooms of the securities industry—exchanges—with quieter aisles, New York Stock Exchange executives said Tuesday. Trading activity on private U.S. stock markets run by big financial firms hit record levels in January, according to figures tabulated by the NYSE, or Big Board. On Jan. 23, 38% of all Big Board-listed stocks were traded internally by banks and on electronic "dark...

PLC's top executives were lucky to escape from the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel alive. On the night, outgoing Chief Executive Patrick Cescau was at the hotel for a farewell dinner with executives from Unilever's big Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever Ltd., according to a person familiar with the situation. With him was his designated successor, Paul Polman, and Harish Manwani, the head of Unilever's Asian, African, Central and Eastern European operations, the person said. Hindustan Unilever's CEO, Nitin Paranjpe, was also there. The group had started dinner when the hotel was attacked, the person said. The hotel's exit was blocked by the terrorists, keeping them trapped for most of the night, the person said. Firefighters rescued the group early Thursday morning, pulling them out through the hotel's windows onto ladders, the person said. —Aaron O. Patrick Banking Executive Is Dead Ashok Kapur, the nonexecutive chairman of Indian banking company Yes Bank Ltd., died in the complex that houses the Oberoi Trident Hotel in southern Mumbai, a family member said Friday. Mr. Kapur and his wife, Madhu, were finishing dessert Wednesday night at the Kandahar Restaurant when terrorists entered and begin firing, according to Mrs. Kapur. The couple tried to escape from a side exit but a gunman blocked their path and told them to stop, Mrs. Kapur said. When the man was distracted, Mrs. Kapur dashed past him and ran through passages to the swimming pool area, she said. When she finally looked behind her, her husband wasn't there. For two days, Mrs. Kapur and her daughter, brother-in-law, niece and other friends have maintained a vigil outside the hotel complex, waiting and hoping he was safe and would emerge when the terrorists were overpowered. On Friday evening, the family was told Mr. Kapur may not have survived. They were taken inside the hotel and identified his body among those of the dead. -- Geeta Anand Indian Carriers Face Squeeze With India's airlines already strapped for cash and buffeted by a combination of higher fuel-prices and lower passenger traffic, the Mumbai terror attacks are expected to cause further industry disruptions. Before the attacks, the country's carriers were projected to report annual losses totaling more that $1.5 billion. Both international and domestic air-traffic in India has shrunk over the past few months. And U.S. hotel officials said this week's events are bound to accelerate the downturn by discouraging foreign tourism. Starting during the summer, India's largest carriers began scaling back plans for overseas expansion and canceling selected long-range flights. Foreign carriers, which have been seeking ways to get an equity stake in some Indian carriers, may use the opportunity to step up those efforts. Foreign carriers, meanwhile, have been trying to swoop in with low-cost fares. In the past few months, domestic air traffic in India has dropped by more than 15%. Despite such ripples from the global economic downturn, India still was projected to be the world's fastest-growing aviation market, with plans to build some 30 new airports over the next two decades. Through 2020, some projections envision a nearly $300 billion market for new aircraft. —Andy Pasztor Briton Dies in Attacks At least one British national died as a result of the terrorist attacks on two luxury hotels and other sites in Mumbai, the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth office said Thursday. Foreign Secretary David Miliband also said that at least seven British nationals were injured in the attacks. It was not clear if any of those had died and Mr. Miliband declined to elaborate. The Cypriot Foreign Ministery later confirmed the dead Briton as Cypriot-born yachting tycoon Andreas Liveras. Mr. Miliband condemned the attacks, saying they "remind us, yet again, of the threat we face from violent extremists." Mr. Miliband was visiting Pakistan to meet with leaders and discuss issues such as combating terrorism when the attacks happened. The diplomatic official said the British continue to monitor the situation. The Foreign and Commonwealth office is advising all British nationals in Mumbai to stay indoors and advises against all nonessential travel to Mumbai and its surrounding area. More than 734,000 British tourists visit India every year and the two countries have close business ties. On Wednesday evening, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he had sent a message to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offering "all necessary help." "These outrageous attacks in Mumbai will be met with a vigorous response," Mr. Brown said in a statement. "Urgent action is underway to offer every possible protection to British citizens in the region." The U.K. is sending police to India to help the authorities there investigate the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, Mr. Brown said Thursday. "At the same time as giving support to the Indian prime minister, we are sending police and emergency teams that are well-versed in dealing with terrorism and we will try to give what support we can through British police and officials to the Indian government at this time ... that's in addition to the expert staff being sent out to help British nationals," he said in a statement. The U.K. government has set up hotlines for people worried about the safety of friends and family. The U.K. number is +44 (0)20 7008 0000. The number in India is (0091) 112419228 Answering journalist's questions Mr. Miliband said it is "very premature" to start talking about the attack having links to Al Qaeda even if the attacks bear their "hallmarks." "Some of the names of groups that are being circulated at the moment are not al Qaeda affiliates, but that can not be taken as a definitive view," he said. —Alistair MacDonald England Cricket Team Postpones Games The England cricket team has postponed two matches in India, where they are visiting for a series of matches. They are currently in Bhubaneswar in east India and were scheduled to fly further north on Thursday to Guwahati. "The safety and security of the team is of the utmost importance," said Hugh Morris, managing director of the sport's governing body, the England and Wales Cricket Board. —Alistair MacDonald Businesses Account for Employees in Mumbai Many multinationals with a presence in India spent Thursday accounting for their Mumbai staff.

PLC ad agency JWT. On Thursday night, some JWT executives were at a restaurant in central Mumbai for an annual awards ceremony, he said. But none of them were harmed, and all of the company's approximately 400 staff in the city had been accounted for on Thursday. The company has a reporting system in place to identify staff quickly in an emergency. "I have been traveling to India so regularly, I have never rated it as a high risk country," said Mr. Maedel. "I take a bit of a fatalistic approach -- things can happen to you almost anywhere," he added. Miles Young, the incoming chief executive of WPP's Ogilvy & Mather ad agency, said that planning for any attack is difficult because they are unpredictable. "We all know Bombay is a city with security issues but it has never been on our mental danger list for an atrocity of this kind," he said. The company consciously avoids some resort venues, such as Bali, which as been the target of past attacks. His company's hotel policy "shies away from staying in iconic hotels in major tourist centers like Bombay anyway, but in many Asian cities one can hardly avoid meetings or visits to them." However, Mr. Young said that he doesn't expect the attacks to deter his company's interest in the fast-growing Indian market. He plans to visit the city soon, and "would not even think of changing that." Other companies also underscored their commitment to the Indian market. In a memo to staff, Paul Aiello, the chief executive of News Corp.'s

leading Indian broadcaster Star TV, said,"Our commitment and mission will not be deterred by such extremist and cowardly acts. We will remain focused on our path towards becoming the leading national broadcaster in India." Star has about 900 staff in India, most of them in Mumbai. None of Star's Mumbai employees had been injured in the attacks. News Corp. also owns Dow Jones & Co. Inc., publisher of The Wall Street Journal. —--Ellen Byron, Yumiko Ono, Alison Tudor, Geoffrey A.Fowler, Aaron Patrick, Geeta Anand and John Satish Kumar Iconic Taj Mahal Hotel Is a Symbol of Mumbai's Tastes, Wealth The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel & Resort is one of the most iconic buildings in Mumbai and India, a symbol of the city's classic tastes as well as its wealth. It is where almost all visiting dignitaries and celebrities stay. Past guests include Bill Clinton, Jacqueline Onassis, Mick Jagger and the Beatles. Below is a history of the hotel from its Web site. The Taj Mahal Palace hotel resort was commissioned by Jamsetji Tata and first opened its doors to guests on December 16, 1903. Tata allegedly decided to build the luxurious hotel after he was refused entry to one of the city's grand hotels of the time, Watson's Hotel, as it was restricted to 'whites only'. The original Indian architects were Sitaram Khanderao Vaidya and D. N. Mirza, but the project was completed by an English engineer W. A. Chambers. The cost of construction was 421 million rupees. During the World War I, the hotel was converted into a 600-bed hospital. The side of the hotel seen from the harbor is actually its rear. The front faces away to the west. There is a widespread misconception that the architects' building plans were confused by the builder so that he built it facing away from the harbor. This is not true, as the hotel was deliberately built facing inland rather than to the harbor. This was probably a deliberate snub to the British king by Jamsedji Tata due to nationalist feelings. Some people believe that the front of the hotel had to face inland because the horse carriages, in which guests came to the hotel, could easily approach the hotel from the city. The carriages were then taken to Wellington Mews. Five decades ago, the old front was closed off, and access is since then through the seaside (former rear). There used to be a Green's Hotel at the Apollo Bunder, which was purchased by the Taj Mahal Hotel. It was at the Green's Hotel, that a small group of pro-Indian Goans (largely employees of the Indian state and communists) assembled and formed the Goan Liberation Council demanding that Portugal cede Goa to India, in the 1950s. This was done at the instigation of Jawaharlal Nehru, and funded by the Kamani Group of Companies. In 1973, Green's hotel was demolished and the present Tower wing was constructed in its place. Currently, the hotel is owned by Taj Hotels, one of the most successful Luxury Hotel & Resort chains in India. Hotels Increase Security U.S. hotel chains also scrambled to assess the situation and step up security at some properties. At Marriott International Inc.,

which operates three hotels in India but wasn't directly impacted by the attacks, a spokesman said the company moved to enhance security at all of those locations. Among other things, Marriott restricted access to the hotels, posted armed guards and began screening all vehicles arriving there. The spokesman said none of those measures were "standard procedure" at its Indian properties before Thursday's attacks. Press officials at Hilton Hotels Corp. and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. weren't immediately available for comment. Marriott spokesman Catherine Leitner said the company has three properties in Mumbai, but none of them have been directly affected. She said "security at these properties has been raised to the highest level," includes the presence of armed guards and "other provisions to prohibit access." Marriott's three hotels are on the opposite side of Mumbai from the southern financial district. They are in the northern part of the city, near the international airport. —Andy Pasztor Airlines Monitor Situation After Wednesday's attacks in Mumbai, international airlines flying to and from the Indian metropolis said they were monitoring the security situation there to determine whether or not they should cancel flights in order to protect passengers and crew, who could be exposed if additional hotels came under attack.

has two flights to Mumbai -- one each from Munich and Frankfurt -- and it cancelled both on Thursday. The carrier's one flight Wednesday, from Frankfurt, was diverted en route to Delhi. "We continue monitoring the situation" to decide whether to cancel more flights, a spokeswoman in Brussels said. A spokesman for Swiss International Air Lines, an independent unit of Deutsche Lufthansa, said its flights are operating normally. The spokesman said Swiss crews aren't based near the bombings, so there were no disruptions, and Swiss's security analysts felt it was safe to operate. "We have had no problems so far," the spokesman said. Air France cancelled a Thursday morning flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle to Mumbai and last night's flight from Mumbai to Paris, but tonight's flight to Mumbai is scheduled to operate normally. An Air France spokeswoman didn't have information on cancellations, but said what normally happens in situations like this is that passengers are more likely to reschedule trips than to cancel them outright. A spokeswoman for Virgin said the airline hasn't cancelled any flights to India. The airline's daily London to Mumbai flight left as scheduled at 10 p.m. last night and tonight's flight is scheduled to leave on time. She said she couldn't comment on whether passengers were calling to cancel or change flights. British Aiways
PLC, one of the foreign carriers with the biggest presence in Mumbai, with two flights from London per day, said it would operate its normal schedule. Air India provides one direct daily flight from Newark to Mumbai. The company couldn't be reached immediately, but seats were still available online for a flight leaving Thursday. India's local carriers haven't canceled flights to and from Mumbai. Jet Airways (India) Ltd., the country's top domestic airline by market share, and rival state-run Air India said their flights were operating as scheduled and they haven't canceled or clubbed their Mumbai flights. Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. said it is clubbing its Mumbai flights as many passengers aren't traveling. The Bangalore-based airline has pooled about 10 flights to and from Mumbai, Prakash Mirpuri, a spokesman for the UB Group, which controls the carrier, said. American carriers are usually "a bit more conservative" with scheduling after an attack while foreign carriers are more likely to maintain all flights, said Jared Blank, editor of Tripmela.com, a newsletter for people who travel within India. Either way, "it really is a difficult call." Travel safety site Safetraveler.com issued an advisory recommending that fliers "defer all travel to Mumbai" and asked anyone already at the airport in Mumbai to remain there "until the situation stabilizes." Mr. Blank expects the Mumbai attacks to damp demand for U.S-Indian luxury travel but not the plans of Indian nationals returning home to visit family, typically in December and January. That segment accounts for 70% of the U.S.-Indian travel market, Mr. Blank said. "People are going to go home," he said, adding that "terrorism in India is becoming a part of life there as it was in London in the 1980s. People are starting to get used to the idea that these sorts of events are going to happen." —Paulo Prada, Daniel Fitzpatrick, Nitin Luthra, Dan Michaels and Jeanne Whalen

Associated Press WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is aiming to hit banks with a fee to recoup losses associated with the government's bailout of financial firms and the auto industry, administration officials say. The White House hopes the fee will soothe the public's anger at financial firms. Most big banks that received public funds have repaid the government, but the industry is seen by many as having survived thanks to taxpayer support, and is now enjoying a profit rebound as the economy struggles. This month, many large banks will resume paying big bonuses to employees. Journal Community Vote: Do you think the Obama administration should levy a fee on banks to recover TARP funds? More Populist Anger Is Fueling Bid to Charge Banks Cuomo Seeks Data on Bonuses Opinion: When Greed Is Not Good Deal Journal: Is Wall Street Caving On Bonuses? Much remains uncertain about how such a fee would work. The administration is wrestling with who should pay, when it should be implemented and what would happen if banks pay more than the government-bailout program ultimately loses. Auto makers aren't currently targets of the fee idea. Even though the proposal is still under discussion, it is expected to be included in the White House's budget, due next month, if only conceptually. It's expected to cost large banks billions of dollars and could also affect bank customers if firms pass along the cost. One option under consideration involves placing a fee on a bank's liabilities, a number that theoretically represents the amount of risk a bank takes on, according to officials familiar with the matter. That approach would also have the effect of tamping down banks' risky behavior, another administration goal. Another option would be to target bank profits, these people said. It's unclear precisely who would be subject to the fee. A person familiar with the matter said it's unlikely for now to target auto companies or American International Group Inc.,

all of which are still struggling. Homeowners who benefited from government-funded housing help also wouldn't pay the fee. A person familiar with the matter said it would make little sense to impose a fee on auto makers or AIG right now: The government owns such a large chunk of them, it would essentially result in the government paying itself. Enlarge Image
Barney Frank, House Financial Services Committee Chairman, favors levy to recoup TARP costs.
Getty Images Some within the administration believe targeting banks is justified because they benefited the most from the overall financial rescue and should bear the brunt of helping the government recoup the cost. The proposal comes as the White House and many banks are locked in a feud about whether financial companies are doing enough to revitalize the economy. The fee would likely be designed to avoid hitting certain segments of the financial industry, such as community banks, many of which are still struggling. The administration is trying to structure the fee so that it can't be passed along to bank customers already struggling in the weak economy, but officials concede that's hard to do. In other areas, such as overdraft fees and credit cards, banks already are passing costs of new legislation on to their customers. "In our industry, costs are typically passed along to institutions and individual investors, so the burden will likely fall on them," said Timothy Ryan, president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Major banks declined to comment. The administration has been talking for months about recouping government funds likely lost through the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, as it is required to do under the legislation that created the program. The Treasury Department estimates losses from the program at $120 billion, though administration officials believe the ultimate cost will be much lower. The fee, which would require congressional approval, could hit big banks that have already repaid their TARP funds with interest. The money would be used to compensate for losses in other areas, such as loans to Detroit's auto makers and funds used to prop up the housing sector and giant insurer AIG. These will be passed on to the banks' customers. It's just one of the many coming hidden taxes that the taxpayers will be facing to deal with the bailouts/massive spending. —Mike Caldwell
Bankers view the proposal as the latest assault on an industry still recovering from the financial meltdown. Although revenue at some big banks has returned to pre-crisis levels, the industry more broadly remains troubled, with many more banks expected to fail. "To impose yet another burden on the industry would obviously decrease their ability to lend," said Edward Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association, a trade group. Bankers say they've already contributed through sums they paid to escape TARP and fees levied by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to build up its deposit-insurance fund. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D., Mass.) said legislation that created TARP mandated that the government recoup its costs by 2013. Since the program is winding down faster than expected, a levy now would be appropriate. "Given the mood of the country," he said, "it is essential that we do it. That was part of the deal." He declined to get into specifics about such a levy. He said it would be unfair to make banks subsidize money given to auto companies, which could eventually account for the lion's share of lost bailout funds. It would be "premature" to force repayment from General Motors Co. and Chrysler LLC, he said, but some repayment mechanism for the auto companies should be considered. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Monday declined to say whether the budget will include a new fee on banks. He did say President Barack Obama wants to make sure taxpayers are repaid for the financial-sector bailout. —Jonathan Weisman and Henry J. Pulizzi contributed to this article.
