--Xoom Inc. looks to launch IPO worth as much as $86.3 million --Firm is low-cost online provider of international money transfers --ConnectOne Bancorp, two medical test makers to list 
 
   By Chris Dieterich 
 NEW YORK--The market for IPOs will look for its next big winner in Xoom Inc., a fast-growing money-transfer service for immigrants in the U.S. looking to send money back home. Initial public offerings have gotten off to a fast start in 2013. Companies raised more than $4.8 billion in January on U.S. exchanges, the most in the first month of any year, according to Dealogic, with $525 million so far in February. Each of the past four weeks has brought at least one new issue that remains 20% or more above its debut price. San Francisco-based Xoom is looking to raise as much as $86.3 million and notch a starting market value as high as $468 million. Xoom operates Xoom.com, a money-transfer business that lets people living in the U.S. use Web-connected computers and smartphones to send money internationally. The market for so-called remittances is poised to grow: Since 2004, the global market has expanded at a 12% annual rate, to $513 billion in 2011, according to the World Bank, and it is expected to grow an additional 7% a year through 2015. Xoom offers cash transfers to 30 countries outside the U.S, though transfers from the U.S. to the Philippines, India and Mexico represent about three-quarters of its business. Nearly a quarter of its transactions are sent through mobile devices. "You no longer need to walk to an agent location during business hours, fill out forms, queue up, and wait another 10 minutes for the teller to process the transaction," said James Friedman, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP, which isn't helping to underwrite the IPO. "With Xoom.com, you can send money 24/7, within minutes, at a smaller cost." The company generates revenue primarily from transaction fees. While its revenues so far represent a scant to 2% to 3% of those of industry leader Western Union Co. (WU), competitive pricing and consistent growth could help it build market share, Mr. Friedman said. Xoom's fast growth has attracted investment from venture capital firms including Sequoia Capital LLC, which will retain a roughly 18% stake after the offering, according to the Xoom's filings. Other early investors will keep roughly 40%. Xoom's revenue grew 68% in the first nine months of 2012, to $57.8 million. The company hasn't reported a profit in any full year and booked a net loss of $4.3 million for the nine months that ended in September, as marketing and customer-service costs increased. The stock is slated to list Friday on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker XOOM. Also on tap in the coming week is ConnectOne Bancorp Inc., a community bank chain founded in 2005 and based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. ConnectOne, formerly known as North Jersey Community Bancorp Inc., operates eight branches and holds a loan portfolio made up largely of commercial-real-estate and business loans. Profit grew 28%, to $6.1 million, during the first nine months of 2012 from a year earlier. Shares of the last two bank IPOs haven't fared well. Miami's Capital Bank Financial Corp. (CBF) and Colorado's National Bank Holdings Corp. (NBHC) both are trading below their September IPO prices. ConnectOne plans to list on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Tuesday under the ticker CNOB. Two medical-test makers could make it to market in the coming week. Cancer Genetics Inc. will look to raise as much as $40 million by listing on the Nasdaq. The early-stage company develops tests using DNA for diagnosing hard-to-detect blood, ovarian and cervical cancers. The Rutherford, N.J., company is to start trading on the Nasdaq Wednesday under the ticker CGIX. A holdover from last week may again make an approach to the market, according to bankers working on the deal. AutoGenomics, of Vista, Calif., makes genetic tests used to determine a predisposition toward, or the presence of, diseases and other medical conditions. The company is looking to raise as much as $66 million on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker AGMX. Write to Chris Dieterich at christopher.dieterich@dowjones.com Email

Washington, D.C. Pundits will debate whether the crowd at Glenn Beck's Saturday rally in Washington was the largest in recent political history, but it was certainly among the most impressive. Mr. Beck is a television host and radio broadcaster with a checkered past and a penchant for incendiary remarks. But if he's judged by the quality of people of all colors that he attracted to the Lincoln Memorial, his stock can't help but rise. Jason Riley discusses Glenn Beck's rally at the Lincoln Memorial.
One would not be able to find a more polite crowd at a political convention, certainly not at a professional sporting event, probably not even at an opera. In fact, judging by the behavior of the attendees following the event, you'd have a tough time finding churches in which people display more patience as others make their way to the exits. This army of well-mannered folks that marched into Washington seemed comprised mainly of people who had once marched in the U.S. Army or other military branch, or at least had a family member who had. Perhaps that's not surprising, given that the event was a fund-raiser for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, which provides scholarships to the children of elite troops killed in the performance of their duty. The day was largely devoted to expressions of gratitude for the sacrifices of U.S. soldiers, for great men of American history like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and for God. But it didn't end there. Dave Roever, a Vietnam veteran, offered a closing prayer in which he thanked the Lord for the president and for the Congress. Despite the unpopularity of the latter two, no booing or catcalls could be heard. Perhaps feeling defensive about how they would be portrayed in media reports, various attendees wore t-shirts noting that they were "Not violent" or "Non-violent." For other participants, there was no need for an explicit message. Relaxed young parents felt comfortable enough to push toddlers in strollers through the crowded areas along the memorial's reflecting pool. Not only was the rally akin to a "huge church picnic" (in one Journal reporter's description), but one had to wonder if the over-achievers in this crowd actually left the area in better shape than they found it. After the event, walking from the Lincoln Memorial's reflecting pool through Constitution Gardens, this reporter scanned 360 degrees and could not see a scrap of trash anywhere. Participants and volunteers had collected all their refuse and left it piled neatly in bags around the public garbage cans. Near Constitution Avenue, I did encounter one stray piece of paper—but too old and faded to have been left that day. Given the huge representation of military families at the event, maybe it's not surprising the grounds were left ship-shape. A principal theme of the day was that attendees should restore the country by making improvements in their own lives—be the change you wish to see in the world, as Gandhi once put it. Most of the participants were strictly amateurs in the business of activism. For many, it was their first appearance at a public demonstration. Their strikingly mild-mannered nature might inspire even Mr. Beck to acknowledge that in a crowd estimated at 300,000, the craziest person at the event might have been the one with the microphone. While he admits that he's part entertainer and prone to over-the-top comments, his followers appear to be sincerely responding to his message that Americans need to cling to their best traditions. (Mr. Beck's program appears on the Fox News Channel, which is owned by News Corp., which also owns this newspaper.) The conservative Mr. Beck's ability to draw this many people to Washington may suggest enormous gains for Republicans come the fall. But the GOP shouldn't expect voters to simply hand them a congressional majority without making them earn it. If pregame chatter and off-season optimism translated into victory, the New York Jets and the Washington Redskins would meet in the Super Bowl every year. Between Saturday's crowd in Washington and the tea partiers agitating for limited government, we may be witnessing the rebuilding of the Reagan coalition, the "fusion" of religious and economic conservatives that political theorist Frank Meyer once endorsed. Reagan always believed that the Republican Party was the natural home for this movement, but GOP leaders in Washington need to prove they are worthy of it. Mr. Freeman is assistant editor of the Journal's editorial page. Email

Updated Jan. 10, 2011 12:01 a.m. ET
(Best of the Tube tonight: We'll be on Fox News Channel's "Hannity" tonight as part of the "Great American Panel." The program starts at 9 p.m. ET, and we'll be on in the latter half hour. A repeat airs at midnight ET.) After the news broke of the attempted murder of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Ariz., it took less than an hour for somebody to point an accusatory finger across the political aisle. At 2:28 p.m. ET Saturday, CNN's Martin Savidge was interviewing David Fitzsimmons, a political cartoonist for the Arizona Daily Star, who offered this reaction: Fitzsimmons: I must tell you, as a columnist who's covered politics in this state, it was inevitable from my perspective. Savidge: Why do you say that? Fitzsimmons: Because the right in Arizona, and I'm speaking very broadly, has been stoking the fire of heated anger and rage successfully in this state. And, you know, it's just stunning when you consider Congresswoman Giffords's positions on the issues. She is a centrist. She is a moderate. And I don't know who the shooter is--have no idea who the shooter is--but what could possibly motivate an individual to be enraged against, or to take down, a moderate centrist? To me that just paints a picture of how off the mark the politics of this state have grown. The Star reported in an editorial yesterday that Fitzsimmons and the paper both apologized for what he described, with the benefit of hindsight, as "emotional, partisan and inappropriate remarks." No such apology has been forthcoming from Paul Krugman or his employer, the New York Times, which published these words of his at 3:22 p.m. Saturday: We don't have proof yet that this was political, but the odds are that it was. She's been the target of violence before. And for those wondering why a Blue Dog Democrat, the kind Republicans might be able to work with, might be a target, the answer is that she's a Democrat who survived what was otherwise a GOP sweep in Arizona, precisely because the Republicans nominated a Tea Party activist. Fitzsimmons and Krugman both admitted that their suppositions about the attack had no factual basis. Apart from the shooting itself, the only fact that was in evidence was Krugman's assertion that Giffords has "been the target of violence before," which was overwrought. Krugman linked to a Politico article according to which "a brick was thrown through her district office window" after the ObamaCare vote--an act of vandalism, not violence, unless people were in the office at the time. Podcast James Taranto on the left and the shooting. What the Washington Post, in a news story, offensively calls the "easy assumption" that "Giffords was targeted by a tea partier" turns out to have been false. To the extent that the suspect, Jared Loughner, had political views, they were disjointed and impossible to categorize--think John Hinckley meets No Labels. A list of his favorite books included "Mein Kampf" and "The Communist Manifesto"; a YouTube video titled "My Final Thoughts: Jared Lee Loughner!" is filled with incomprehensible syllogisms such as this: "If B.C.E. years are unable to start then A.D.E years are unable to begin. B.C.E. years are unable to start. Thus, A.D.E years are unable to begin." One might say that Fitzsimmons and Krugman were merely engaging in speculation. As John Podhoretz observes in the New York Post: "Our compulsive hunger always to know first, speak first and decide first has only been amplified by the fact that we can now all participate instantly in a virtual version of a national cocktail-party conversation on Twitter, Facebook and blogs." Another way of describing Fitzsimmons's and Krugman's comments is that they were fantasies. In the absence of facts, each man constructed a fictional story to explain what had happened. These stories tell us nothing about the external world, but they give us a window into the psyches of Fitzsimmons and Krugman. Both imagined the assassin not only as politically motivated but as acting according to political logic. They actually disagreed about whether Giffords, as a centrist, was a suitable target in the mind of their notional assassin, with Krugman arguing in the affirmative and Fitzsimmons asking rhetorically, "What could possibly motivate an individual to be enraged against, or to take down, a moderate centrist?"--as if such an action would be more understandable if the victim's voting record had been more consistent with standard ideological categories. The notion that the killer acted according to some political logic existed only in the minds of people like Fitzsimmons and Krugman. It was pure fantasy, and it turned out not to correspond with reality. Yet many on the left, including in the mainstream media, are treating this fantasy as if it were fact, or at least a legitimate point of view. As with any left-wing fantasy nowadays, the former governor of Alaska plays a central role. "Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' Blood Is on Sarah Palin's Hands After Putting Cross Hair Over District," screams a headline in yesterday's New York Daily News. "Liberals Blame Sarah Palin in Wake of Tucson Shooting," reads the headline of Politico story posted at 4:23 p.m. Saturday, less than three hours after news of the shooting broke. Straight-news reporters, too, put Palin into the story. An Associated Press dispatch on the massacre gave her four paragraphs; a New York Times report, three paragraphs. Why? Because last March, Palin's political action committee included Giffords on a list of 20 representatives it was targeting for defeat. All came from districts in which John McCain outpolled Barack Obama, and all voted for ObamaCare. (Only two of the 20, Giffords and West Virginia's Rep. Nick Rahall, made it to the 112th Congress. Two retired, one lost a Senate bid, one was defeated in a primary, and the other 14 were beaten in November.) The list was illustrated by a map showing cross hairs--they looked like gun sights, although a Palin spokeswoman has said they were actually surveyor's symbols--in the approximate geographic locations of the representatives' districts. At the time, the left cried bloody murder, claiming that Palin was inciting violence against members of Congress. Again, this was pure left-wing fantasy. As blogger John Sexton noted contemporaneously, the Democratic Leadership Committee and the Democratic National Campaign Committee had both earlier produced similar maps, albeit using bull's-eyes instead of cross hairs. The DCCC map "targeted" specific congressmen and, unlike Palin's map, included their photographs. Neither Palin's map nor the Democrats' maps were an incitement to violence. They employed an ordinary visual metaphor as part of a political campaign. (The word "campaign" is itself a martial metaphor.) No evidence has emerged that Jared Loughner even knows who Sarah Palin is, much less that he construed the map as a command to commit murder. To be sure, Saturday's horror casts the Palin map in an unappealing light. It would be in poor taste to continue displaying it. Accordingly, SarahPAC quickly removed it from its website. But it is all over the Web, disseminated far and wide by people who purport to believe that the document they are distributing is an incitement to violence. Paul Krugman, wrong but undaunted.
Getty Images "We don't have proof yet that this was political," Paul Krugman wrote on Saturday afternoon. Proof emerged very quickly that it wasn't. Yet having jumped to a conclusion and been proved wrong, Krugman plows ahead anyway. In today's column he blames Saturday's crime on "the national climate" created by "toxic rhetoric" that is "coming, overwhelmingly, from the right." The New Yorker's George Packer, similarly, uses the shooting as an occasion to denounce conservatives: Many conservative leaders, activists, and media figures have made a habit of trying to delegitimize their political opponents. . . . This relentlessly hostile rhetoric has become standard issue on the right. (On the left it appears in anonymous comment threads, not congressional speeches and national T.V. programs.) There is no denying that "relentlessly hostile rhetoric" can be found on the right, and also on the left. (On the center, too, for that matter.) Opinions will vary as to where the problem is worst, and it is human nature to find fault with the other side more readily than with one's own. That said, it seems to us there is a very strong case to be made that the ugliest political rhetoric of the past 48 hours has been that coming from the side whose leading voices are attempting to make sense of a senseless crime by blaming their opponents for it. Or perhaps we should say from the side that is attempting to exploit the crime in this manner. Politico quotes an unnamed "veteran Democratic operative" who offers this advice to the White House: "They need to deftly pin this on the tea partiers," said the Democrat. "Just like the Clinton White House deftly pinned the Oklahoma City bombing on the militia and anti-government people." The Washington Examiner's Byron York recalls how Bill Clinton, with the advice of Dick Morris, did that: At a White House meeting . . . on April 27 [1995], Morris presented Clinton with a comeback strategy based on his polling. Morris prepared an extensive agenda for the session, a copy of which he would include in the paperback version of his memoir, Behind the Oval Office. This is how the April 27 agenda began: AFTERMATH OF OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING A. Temporary gain: boost in ratings--here today, gone tomorrow B. More permanent gain: Improvements in character/personality attributes--remedies weakness, incompetence, ineffectiveness found in recent poll C. Permanent possible gain: sets up Extremist Issue vs. Republicans Later, under the heading "How to use extremism as issue against Republicans," Morris told Clinton that "direct accusations" of extremism wouldn't work because the Republicans were not, in fact, extremists. These days Dick Morris leans Republican, a reminder that foul character can be found everywhere on the political spectrum, again including in the center. In light of his advice to Clinton, though, we can see why Politico's "veteran Democratic operative" would not want his name revealed. His idea is as boneheaded as it is depraved. It is one thing to "pin" the Oklahoma City bombing on "the militia," a fringe movement with which the perpetrator seems to have had some sympathy. It is quite another to blame Saturday's massacre on "the Tea Partiers," a mainstream movement that has the support of somewhere on the order of 40% of Americans, but not, by all accounts, the suspect. Further, it is too late to avoid " 'direct accusations' of extremism." The media have been filled with them for the past two awful days. Thus far President Obama's response to Saturday's horrific crime has been appropriate and low-key. Our expectation is that he will not take the low road paved by the likes of Paul Krugman and Politico's unnamed operative. "Even if hate is what many want to hear, that doesn't excuse those who pander to that desire," a newspaper columnist wrote recently. "They should be shunned by all decent people." If the president wants to exercise real leadership, he could call on Americans, including his own supporters, to resist and repudiate the impulse to blame political opponents for Saturday's insane and evil acts.

Democrats Outraise GOP in Senate Tossups
Republican Super PACs Offset Part of Disparity in 11 Key Races; Allies of Nevada's Reid Help Create Firewall for Majority
By
Brody Mullins and Naftali Bendavid Nov. 5, 2012 7:59 p.m. ET
In the battle for the Senate, which could determine the next president's room for maneuver, Democrats have built a surprising advantage: They have outraised Republicans. In the 11 Senate races considered tossups, Democratic candidates outraised their Republican opponents by a combined $45 million, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. Republican super PACs and interest groups have offset part of that disparity....

By
Reed Albergotti and Vanessa O'Connell Updated Jan. 18, 2013 7:08 a.m. ET
Former professional cyclist Lance Armstrong told the world Thursday evening that he used performance-enhancing drugs to win seven Tour de France titles. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Mr. Armstrong said that like many other cyclists of his generation, he used EPO, human-growth hormone, testosterone and other drugs to compete.

Options Activity Questioned Again By
Kaitlyn Kiernan
Feb. 18, 2013 8:42 p.m. ET
A windfall bet made in H.J. Heinz Co. options one day before a buyout was announced Thursday prompted regulators to act quickly, freezing assets they suspect are tied to the trade. But the Heinz bet, which the Securities and Exchange Commission said could have paid out $1.7 million, was just the latest in a series of unusual options trades made ahead of the disclosures of big deals and other news that moved share prices. Over...

Soy Climbs as Argentina Rains Spark Supply Worry
By
Owen Fletcher
Dec. 3, 2012 5:41 p.m. ET
U.S. soybean futures rose 1% Monday, as heavy rains delayed the planting of a new soy crop in parts of Argentina. The delays are sparking concerns among traders that Argentina, the world's third-largest soybean producer, after the U.S. and Brazil, may not produce as large a crop as once expected. Global soybean supplies are tight after droughts in the U.S. and South America earlier this year cut production in both regions, making a...

The day after Thanksgiving, straight out the blue, I got a letter from New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art asking if I would like to "fine-tune my estate planning." This request totally floored me, given that I am not even a member of the Met. But what really rankled was that for the first time in my life someone was using the U.S. Postal Service to inform me that I was going to die. As far as I can recollect, it was the...

WASHINGTON—A U.S. Marine sergeant shot and killed a male corporal and female lance corporal, and then killed himself on Thursday night at the Marine Corps Officer Candidate School in Quantico, Va., officials said Friday. The investigation Friday centered around a likely romantic entanglement, officials said, adding the precise motive for the shooting was still unclear. The names of the Marines were being withheld pending notification of relatives. Marine Base Quantico spokesman Lt. Agustin Solivan briefed reporters following the shooting incident at the base on Thursday night. A marine killed himself after shooting a male and female colleague to death. Photo: AP.
All three Marines were staff members at the school, and the sergeant worked as a trainer, officials said. Law-enforcement officials were called to Taylor Hall, a barracks building at Quantico, at about 10:30 p.m. Thursday after the first reports of a shooting. Marine officials citing initial reports said the alleged attacker was isolated in a barracks building by law-enforcement personnel before killing himself. "We have begun to deal with the tremendous loss that happened last night, and on behalf of Marine Corps Base Quantico and the Officer Candidate School, I want to express my sincere condolences to the families, the friends…of the three Marines that we lost last night," Col. David Maxwell, the base commander, told reporters Friday morning. Enlarge Image
Col. David Maxwell commands the base where the killings occurred.
Marine Corps Times/Associated Press A Marine Corps spokesman said no one else was injured at the base. "It was isolated to those three Marines," said spokesman Sgt. Christopher Zahn. The base was put on lockdown after the shooting for about 3½ hours but then returned to normal operations. The deaths at Quantico come on the heels of a training accident in Nevada that killed seven Marines and injured eight more Monday. Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was notified of the deaths at Quantico. "This tragedy, as well as the tragedy in Nevada earlier this week, took the lives of Marines who volunteered to serve their nation," Mr. Little said. Write to Julian E.

HOBOKEN, N.J.—A broad range of ideas is under review to fortify this compact city against the kind of floodwaters that overwhelmed it from two directions during superstorm Sandy—from building a sea wall to raising power stations high above ground. Protective structures also have been proposed for New York City across the Hudson River, but Mayor Michael Bloomberg
has rejected projects such as a sea wall as too expensive. Hoboken, though, is so vulnerable and so small—just one mile square—that experimental measures might be feasible. Enlarge Image
The Long Slip Canal that runs along side of the NJ Transit rail yards experienced extensive flooding from superstorm Sandy.
Peter Foley for The Wall Street Journal "Hoboken is small enough. Maybe some crazy idea would be useful," said Philip Orton, a research scientist and storm-surge expert at the Stevens Institute of Technology, a private university in Hoboken. Mayor Dawn Zimmer said she wants new flood protection in place by the end of 2013. "From my standpoint, we can't go another year like this," she said. Among the ideas are raising city roads, adding pumps and building a mammoth system that would channel floodwaters into tunnels and onto lower-lying land to take advantage of the Meadowlands' natural function as a drainage system for New Jersey cities—including Hoboken. Zoning changes are also being considered to prevent the building of ground-floor apartments in flood zones, as is a shift to an energy system that would allow the city to produce some of its own power to supplement the utility grid. "I think Hoboken is a perfect candidate for smart grid," said Adam Zellner, president of Greener by Design, a New Brunswick consulting firm that has spoken to the city about creating independent power production. "It can be done in a way that's much more digestible because it's small." Although the proposals have sparked the imagination of engineers, the federal government has yet to weigh in on what it would recommend. Ms. Zimmer is assembling a task force of property owners, local officials and engineers from the Stevens Institute to discuss the city's flood-protection options. One measure the mayor supports would raise the city's power substations onto platforms such as shipping containers, a novelty that has been used in other flood-prone areas. An estimated 90% of the city lost power after Sandy flooded Hoboken's three substations. "We have to think outside a box," Ms. Zimmer said. "I don't want to be going into hurricane season with my substations exposed." A sea wall also could have helped prevent flooding from the Long Slip Canal—an industrial inlet near NJ Transit's rail yards that was overwhelmed by Sandy's storm surge, said Ron Hine, director of the Fund for a Better Waterfront, a group monitoring Hoboken coastline development. Two luxury developments sustained serious flooding from the canal storm surge. "A sea wall in front of the canal could help solve that problem," Mr. Hine said. Few debate the need for better flood protection in Hoboken, a city that until the 19th century was on an island. Swaths of it remain below sea level. Hoboken has flooded repeatedly in the past, and in the spring a $17 million pump was completed in the city's southwest section to help mitigate heavy rains. The pump can remove 75 million gallons of water per day from the city when running, and it did its job during Sandy, said city spokesman Juan Melli. "It makes the water drain a lot faster," Mr. Melli said. "If we hadn't had it, the flooding would have remained for many more days." Sandy pushed floodwaters into the city from Weehawken Cove in the north and from Long Slip Canal in the south. Residents, some of whom were trapped in their buildings for days, said floodwaters were chest-high in some streets. Sandy caused $10 million in damage to city infrastructure, and the Hoboken City Council recently approved $4.2 million in emergency expenditures to repair damaged city facilities. "I lost everything," said Karen Nason, a Hoboken resident and business owner who sustained flooding both in her home and her floral shop. Her car was ruined, and much of the stock in her store died. Flood-protection efforts will depend on federal funding. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie included more than $7 billion for mitigation and prevention in his request for congressional funding for the state after Sandy. Details on what the mitigation funds would cover haven't been made available. Even routine flood-prevention projects are costly. One such, to restore 21 miles of shoreline between Sea Bright and Manasquan in New Jersey, will cost $222 million, with additional spending in store to continue replenishing sand once it erodes. A tunnel system to divert floodwaters from Hoboken and other New Jersey cities to the Meadowlands would likely cost billions of dollars, though it would offer a more long-term flood-projection strategy than simply lifting roads or building a sea wall, Mr. Orton said. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers doesn't have mitigation studies specifically looking at Hoboken, but top agency leaders spoke with Hoboken officials immediately after Sandy, and those conversations likely addressed future flood prevention, said Chris Gardner, a spokesman for the New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Hoboken resident Chris Halleron has seen his commute time double since PATH service was suspended due to Sandy. He said he was open to flood-mitigation measures, even those that were unsightly. "We moved to Hoboken for its pretty views of Manhattan, but if we had to look over a sea wall to maintain those views, I'm all for it," said Mr. Halleron, a magazine editor. "It needs to be addressed." —Sharon Adarlo and Jennifer Weiss contributed to this article. Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com Email
