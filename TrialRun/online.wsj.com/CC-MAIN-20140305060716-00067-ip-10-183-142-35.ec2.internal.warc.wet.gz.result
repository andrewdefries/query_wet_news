What more can they offer you? Here they are, a gold-medal women's soccer team from the U.S., delivering an exhilarating saga not for one or two weeks, or 12 months, but for years now, spanning all the emotional clichés that sound so satisfying on TV. Triumph. Heartbreak. Redemption. Sniff, sniff. They totally got you, didn't they? But it's even better than that! Don't just drip it up in the sentimental feel-good. There's some hard feelings, elbows and grit in there. Rivalries. Confrontation. Antagonism. It's messy and personal and wonderful. The U.S. women's soccer team celebrates after beating Japan 2-1 to win the gold medal.
European Pressphoto Agency Related Article One of Soccer's Great Rivalries Bounces in America's Direction Now it's over, at least for the time being. The U.S. women's national soccer team are Olympic champions, after a tense 2-1 win over Japan that avenged a loss in last year's World Cup. Here come the victory laps and the morning shows and personal appearances. Here comes an exhilarating rush of jubilation, like those rushes after the World Cup in 1999 and the golds in Athens and Beijing. The gold-medal U.S. women's soccer team got their revenge over Japan who beat them in the World Cup last year. WSJ's John Crowley and Shirley Wang assess the players of the match and why Carli Lloyd's second goal deserves a place in soccer history. Photo: Getty Images
And then—wait for it, because it's inevitable—here comes another wave of speculation about What It All Means, whether or not women's soccer will ever crack through as a viable business in the U.S. Here comes a debate about what has to happen for the sport to become an industry, like the NFL and baseball, until the point that every female soccer player in the country is driving around in a Bentley convertible, lighting $100 bills on fire. Alright, alright, alright. Everyone knows that conversation will happen. And it would be great if the game found a sustainable domestic future (a new league is reportedly coming in 2013). But for the moment, let's focus on the now. Because the now is pretty…awesome. There were 80,203 people at Wembley Stadium Thursday night—hallowed Wembley!—to watch this women's final. It was an Olympic record; when veteran striker Abby Wambach stepped out onto the field at game time, she couldn't believe it. "I've never played in front of a crowd as big as that," she said. These Olympic fans were not khaki-wearers comped tickets for selling time shares and sports cars—these were serious women's soccer fans. Japan was well represented, and U.S. fans swarmed the place, flying red, white and blue flags on a warm, low-70s London night. Streaming Coverage Get the latest Journal coverage of the 2012 Games right here—every story, video, photo or tweet related to the competition and all news off the field.
These fans didn't come to cheer just for colors. They knew them by their first names. Abby. Hope. Megan. Christie. Carli. Alex. If there's a currency in U.S. sport after wins and trophies, it's fame. And while the USWNT may not have household names approaching Kobe and LeBron, its names mean something to a lot of households. But what truly captivated the U.S. about this team were not its best-known, individual parts, but the whole, crazy thing. The team was the star. They proved it a year ago, with a loss. Wambach and her World Cup co-conspirators sneaked up on the country, saving a dull summer usually suffocated by sleepy major league doubleheaders. A dramatic win over Brazil triggered a social-media frenzy; later, there were record TV ratings for a penalty-kick defeat to Japan in the final. Wambach said the loss left her devastated, and the team scrambling to stick together. "Your team can go one way or the other after something like that," she said. They went the right way. They brought a determination to these Olympics, sailing through group play undefeated. They were aggressive and took aggression back. Wambach landed an early black eye. In the semifinals there was a contentious win over Canada, and plenty of howling about favoritism toward the U.S. women, but they charged forward, unrattled, focused. Now this. Now gold. These U.S. women carry a strange double role. Seldom a media session passes in which they are not asked to analyze both the game that took place in front of them and what the game means more broadly for the future of their sport. Eighty thousand people can't just be 80,000 people. It has to be a symbol of something bigger. They carry this role with grace. "Eighty thousand people for a women's final?" asked midfielder Carli Lloyd, who scored both U.S. goals. "That says a lot about women's sports, women's soccer." They didn't want to leave the place. It was getting close to 11 p.m.—the crowd had thinned down to the photographers and the families, and the U.S. women were still walking around the Wembley field in their navy track suits, gold medals dangling from their necks, bouquets in their hands. They looked like a flock—moving as a single entity, never separating from each other for more than five or six feet. Music blasted from the stadium PA: Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A.," Queen's "We Are the Champions," Katy Perry's "Firework." Wambach wrapped an arm around Solo, so brilliant and game-saving all night. Megan Rapinoe flapped her arms like her bird. The future can wait. A team won today.

March 18, 2013 7:35 a.m. ET
The FX Global Call covers the main talking points from a news meeting involving DJ FX Trader editors in New York, London and Singapore, as well as other FX hot spots when warranted. 1. The tiny nation of Cyprus (pop. 1.1 million) has managed to rattle global financial markets and bring into question many of the assumptions that have dictated trends since the start of the year.

Russell Wilson runs the ball during the NFC Wild Card Playoff Game in January.
Getty Images Generously listed in his Seattle Seahawks biography page as 5 feet 11, rookie quarterback Russell Wilson is of fairly average height for a normal man walking the Earth. But he's the shortest quarterback in the NFL. When compared to fellow playoff passers like Baltimore's Joe Flacco (6 feet 6) and San Francisco's Colin Kaepernick (6 feet 5), he looks like he'd be more at home baking cookies in a hollowed-out magical tree.

But Wilson has miraculously navigated the unusually gigantic world of the NFL, leading his team into the divisional round of the playoffs, where they face the Atlanta Falcons Sunday. Already he stands tall as one of the best short quarterbacks: Only eight players shorter than Wilson have thrown an NFL pass since 1970. According to former players, coaches and analysts, there's a simple checklist for a diminutive quarterback like Wilson to succeed in the NFL. Wilson, for his part, said this week that "my height doesn't define my skill set. I feel I can make any play on the field." But others may disagree: 1. Drop back far. Like, really far. Hall of fame quarterback Warren Moon says Wilson has perfected the play-action pass, a type of fake handoff that allows him precious time to scoot back behind the line of scrimmage. The farther back he is from his offensive linemen, some of whom are 8 inches taller than him, the easier it is for him to see receivers downfield. Podcast
This is helped, Moon says, by Wilson's nimble feet, his ability to roll out and his quick hands, which allow for masterful fakes that buy him time and keep defenders at bay. The result? Wilson rarely has to take a standard three-step drop and attempt to throw over the wall of humans. It also helps to rip a few pages out of the playbook. Former NFL quarterback Doug Flutie, who was listed at 5 feet 10, said certain pass patterns are tough for short quarterbacks. Specifically, plays that call for a receiver to make a double move, like an out-and-up route, require additional time to develop, allowing the defense's gargantuan pass rushers to crowd the quarterback. "Tom Brady can stand firm in the pocket and survey the whole field even when the pass rush gets close," said Flutie, now an analyst for NBC. "The closer the pass rush got to me, the more it looked like I was throwing out of a well." 2. Employ some considerate linemen No matter how much the Seahawks try to move their quarterback around in the pocket, there comes a time in every game when Wilson has to do what every other NFL quarterback does—drop back and throw the football over the heads of the big galoots who protect him from pulverization. Seahawks center Max Unger says there's only one practical thing the linemen can do to help their quarterback in this situation—duck. "As far as the height thing, there isn't really too much you can do about that apart from bend your knees a little bit more," he said. "We try to do that, anyway." 3. Hide behind your stud running back On one second-quarter play in Seattle's wild-card win over the Washington Redskins Sunday, the Seahawks unveiled an interesting wrinkle on offense in which they used Pro Bowl running back Marshawn Lynch as a lead blocker for Wilson, who followed his teammate up the middle for a 19-yard gain. View Graphics
illustrations by Mitch O'Connell The play was so effective because Wilson was momentarily hidden from the defense by Lynch, who is the same height but 11 pounds heavier than his quarterback. It wouldn't work quite so well in Denver, for example, where Peyton Manning stands 6 inches taller than running back Knowshon Moreno. Even when they're not literally shielding Wilson from opposing defenders, the Seahawks running backs have helped to hide some of their quarterback's weaknesses. Seattle's strong rushing attack means defenses are more vulnerable to fake handoffs, read-option runs and bootlegs off play-action, which the Seahawks have utilized to open wide passing lanes for their vertically-challenged quarterback. "That's what makes our play-action game so good," Seattle tight end Zach Miller said. "We can fake it to Marshawn and it's going to get a reaction from linebackers. It definitely takes the pressure off." 4. Have a strong arm, big hands and a good sense of self-preservation Despite his wee stature, Wilson possesses one of the 10 strongest arms in the league, according to Moon, which means he can throw the ball without a problem from well behind the line of scrimmage. He also has unnaturally large hands, which allow him to grip the ball tighter and throw with greater velocity. Wilson's hands were measured at 10¼ inches at the NFL scouting combine last year, which was fourth-highest among all quarterbacks in his class and more than a quarter of an inch bigger than those of Brock Osweiler, the 6-foot-7 tent-pole quarterback of the Denver Broncos. All of that means he's able to throw what Moon calls one of the best deep balls in the game. Wilson's size also gives him one big advantage—there's not much of him to hit. New rules that limit contact with quarterbacks have only enhanced this advantage. In recent years, the NFL has implemented a crackdown on shots to the head and defenders are no longer allowed to hit quarterbacks below the knees. That doesn't give defenders a lot of quarterback to aim at. "With the rules the way they are now, they've basically got to grab you by the torso and pull you down," said Flutie. "But there's not a lot of torso on him." Former Pittsburgh Steelers coach and CBS analyst Bill Cowher says Wilson's awareness allows him to not ever get hit. He said smaller quarterbacks tend to panic and set forth on ill-advised runs when under pressure. Wilson, Cowher says, camps in the pocket and knows exactly when to throw. "In all the times I've seen him run, he never takes a big hit. He's got a very good knack for being able to make those decisions on safety and also whether to run or pass," Cowher said. "He sees the rush coming and he does not flinch. He steps to the side, he gets his feet set up." 5. Enjoy the fringe benefits If you think life as an NFL quarterback is all about tossing touchdown passes in sold-out stadiums while cheerleaders blow you kisses from the sidelines, you're sorely mistaken. The NFL regular season can also be an endless treadmill of crisscrossing flights and getting hounded by eager autograph seekers. But this is where short quarterbacks can find the biggest perks. While the act of wedging a jumbo-sized football player into an airplane seat usually requires an impressive degree of physical dexterity, Wilson can sit back and relax on those long flights from the Pacific Northwest. For an NFL quarterback who is the size of a regular human being, it's also possible to dodge the screaming fans by passing yourself as an ordinary Joe. "Cam Newton walks into a room and people's heads turn because he's 6-feet-6, so there's a little advantage there," said Flutie. "And you can buy a suit off the rack if you want."
