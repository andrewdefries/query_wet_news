ATHENS--Greece's Piraeus Bank (TPEIR.AT) Thursday reported a 513 million euro loss for 2012 on higher funding costs and impairment charges. A year earlier, the bank reported a loss of EUR6.6 billion, when it wrote off the impact Greece's mammoth EUR200 billion debt restructuring. Piraeus Bank, which agreed earlier this week to buy the Greek branch network and operations of three Cypriot lenders, said net interest income for 2012 dipped to EUR1.02 billion from EUR1.17 billion in the previous year. "Following the significant deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, total impairment charges reached a high level during 2012 of which EUR2.04 billion is related to loan impairment charges," the bank said in a statement. In a bid to become more efficient and attractive to potential investors, the sector has been consolidating at a fast pace. Piraeus Bank also has acquired the local unit of Societe Generale SA and the healthy assets of state-owned farm lender ATEBank. Piraeus Bank's total assets will reach EUR98 billion after purchasing the Cypriot bank branches for EUR524 million, it said. National Bank (NBG) is teaming up with Eurobank (EUROB.AT), while Alpha Bank (ALPHA.AT) has acquired the Greek unit of French lenders Credit Agricole SA. On Wednesday, three of Greece's largest lenders--NBG, Eurobank and Alpha Bank--reported joint losses of some EUR4.7 billion, hurt by rising loan provisions and higher funding costs, and played down the impact on operations of the banking crisis in neighboring Cyprus. As part of Greece's second EUR173 billion bailout package from international creditors, Athens has earmarked about EUR50 billion for bank recapitalization. Under the plan, Greece's bank rescue fund will underwrite coming rights issues and effectively take control of the four big banks, which combined account for three-quarters of the banking system's assets.

Nov. 2, 2012 7:32 p.m. ET
One of the main functions of a media website's home page is to feed readers a steady diet of stories about bizarre things that might kill them. Vindictive insects. Duplicitous Schnauzers. Toxic herbs. Small but determined fish. This kind of material gets you going in the morning, and presumably it makes the man in the street worry less about the ordinary things that might kill him: funicular crashes, poorly maintained lawn furniture, hit men who go to the wrong address, scurvy. The other day, I logged on to MSN.com and spotted a link to a Health.com article entitled "15 Weird Things Linked to Heart Attacks." The list of things that could lead to a heart attack included psoriasis, insensitive bosses, calcium supplements, living in a crummy neighborhood, antibiotics, relationship issues, abruptly stopping the use of aspirin, depression, the stress of urban living —especially heavy traffic—and, of course, gum disease. Crummy commute? Better hope you don't also have gum disease.
Masterfile Surprisingly, gorging on stuffed bratwurst bathed in a rich, unctuous jalapeño-cheddar sauce and the unexpected discovery of famished pumas in the family room did not make the list. Lest Doubting Thomases deem such findings spurious, let it be noted that Health.com cited researchers at Harvard Medical School, the University of Chicago and other prestigious institutions. So this wasn't a bunch of jokers goofing off. Don't think calcium supplements can kill you, pal? Go ahead, try one. Much as I enjoyed reading this material, I didn't think the report went into nearly enough depth. I for one would have liked to hear more about killer bosses. Nor did Health.com address the possibility that people exposed to more than one of these 15 "weird" contributing factors would surely run an even higher risk of winding up with heart disease. It stands to reason that if you stop using aspirin because you are depressed about having a boss whose psoriasis makes him overbearing and mean, you are much more likely to have problems with your ticker. Similarly, if you live in a terrible neighborhood where everyone has gum disease, you run a much greater risk of winding up stuck in traffic with an abusive spouse, all of which could trigger a massive coronary. Especially if your kids keep hiding your emergency aspirin supply because they want to get their hands on your money. "We knew Kayla was upset about her boss, her horrible marriage to that idiot Galt, her bad gums and having to live in Fresno," a mourner might say at the wake. "But until she stopped taking aspirin for the headaches she got because she lived in a dangerous neighborhood and had low HDL cholesterol, we didn't know how serious things were." I often wonder if there are people out there who read these provocative, albeit unnerving, articles and alter their lifestyle on the spot. It wouldn't surprise me, for the subtext of these reports is clear: To avoid having a heart attack, you should immediately move to a thinly populated rural area, retire or start your own business, take tons of aspirin, get divorced at the first sign that your spouse might develop contagious gum disease, and stock up on tons of steroids, anticholesterol medications and skin-care products. I would also like to see these reports cast a wider net. Sometimes I think that health writers stick too close to familiar turf with their constant discussion of dull-as-dishwater diseases like heart disease and cancer. Why can't they occasionally throw us a curve, with articles like: "10 Things You Didn't Know about Dysentery. Make That 20"; "25 Proven Ways to Avoid Leprosy"; and "50 Ways to Die That Are Weirder Than Having a Heart Attack Because Your Gums Went South." The stories could also come with much sexier headlines: "Fargo and Arterial Sclerosis: The Untold Story"; "Neighbors Wrecked My Grandma's Ticker"; "Calcium Supplements and Marriage: The Silent Killers"; "Stop Taking Aspirin—and Die!"; and "Did Nostradamus Predict that Living in East St. Louis Could Lead to Quadruple Bypass Heart Surgery?" Yes, just for the record, he did. And he said the exact same thing about El Paso. Explore More

This Time, Obama Takes Case to the Public
President Reverses Tack He Took in 2011 Debt Talks When He Holed Up at White House; GOP Balks at His Approach By
Carol E. Lee and Peter Nicholas Updated Dec. 7, 2012 7:41 p.m. ET
Anyone seeking a road map for President Barack Obama's handling of the current budget crisis need only consider his actions during the 2011 fight over the debt limit—and assume he'll do the opposite. In debt talks last year, Mr. Obama made concessions on spending cuts early and often. This time, he has so far made none while remaining uncompromising on his ideal level of tax increases. In the last go-round, he holed up in the...

Workers and employers in the U.S. are bracing for a retirement crisis, even as the stock market sits near highs and the economy shows signs of improvement. Kelly Greene reports. Photo: AP.
Workers and employers in the U.S. are bracing for a retirement crisis, even as the stock market sits near highs and the economy shows signs of improvement. New data show that powerful financial and demographic forces are combining to squeeze individuals and companies that are trying to save for the future and make their money last. Enlarge Image
Fifty-seven percent of U.S. workers surveyed reported less than $25,000 in total household savings and investments excluding their homes, according to a report to be released Tuesday by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Only 49% reported having so little money saved in 2008. The survey also found that 28% of Americans have no confidence they will have enough money to retire comfortably—the highest level in the study's 23-year history. More on Saving for Retirement The Experts: Retirement Key to Retirement: Spend Less, Save More Say Goodbye to the 4% Rule MarketWatch: Retirement Center MarketWatch: 10 Things Medicare Won't Tell You WSJ: A Low-Cost Option for Your Nest Egg WSJ: Lower Your Taxes on Social Security Benefits Read More at WSJ.com/Encore The same forces are weighing on corporate balance sheets. Based on another recent report, the Society of Actuaries said that rising life expectancies could add as much as $97 billion to corporate pension liabilities in coming years, an increase of up to 5%. While Americans are living longer, the extended life spans will make it tougher for workers trying to stretch retirement savings and put additional strains on pension plans. Scott Ghelfi, 49 years old, a small-business owner in Falmouth, Mass., and his wife own two candy stores and a children's clothing shop. He said they didn't make their normal $24,000 contribution to their retirement plan two years ago because they couldn't afford to take the money out of the businesses. The total amount in the couple's retirement accounts is less than $200,000, which he considers inadequate. "Sales are fine, but we're not growing rapidly like we were several years back, and everything is more expensive," Mr. Ghelfi said. He isn't alone. The percentage of workers who have saved for retirement plunged to 66% from 75% in 2009, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute survey. Only about half of the 1,003 workers and 251 retirees surveyed said they were sure they could come up with $2,000 if an unexpected need were to arise in the next month. Related Video
Saving for retirement is a big goal for many folks. Here's a look at how much they're saving, how prepared they feel and what their adviser is telling them.
"Workers are recognizing there is a crisis," said Alicia Munnell,
director of the Boston College Center for Retirement Research. She noted that companies continue to do away with traditional pensions. The survey of workers and retirees was conducted in January, even as the U.S. stock market was heading toward new highs. Many people are struggling to make sure they don't run out of money in retirement, said Jack VanDerhei, research director at EBRI, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C. The EBRI survey doesn't count traditional pensions, which are designed to provide retirees for steady income throughout their lives. But pensions have become a much smaller component of Americans' retirement-savings mix over the years. The portion of private-sector U.S. workers covered only by so-called defined-benefit plans fell to 3% in 2011 from 28% in 1979, according to U.S. Department of Labor data compiled by EBRI. Companies that still offer pensions might have to kick in more money to account for longer life spans. The Society of Actuaries in September released the first update since 2000 to its mortality projections for U.S. retirement plans, which project life spans for pensioners. The report offers assumptions that actuaries use to project mortality rates. Companies are expected to start using the new assumptions this year. According to the society, a male who reaches age 65 in 2013 is expected to live an additional 20.5 years, up from 19.5 in the earlier projections. Women turning 65 this year are now expected to live an additional 22.7 years, up from 21.3. Although the increases might seem small, Bruce Cadenhead, chief retirement actuary with Mercer, a consulting unit of Marsh & McLennan

cited the growth in the life expectancy for its plan's beneficiaries as one reason its global pension-funding gap widened to $3.5 billion last year from $3.1 billion in 2011. A Goodyear spokesman said it made the mortality adjustment "because we saw an increase in [the] actual longevity of our participants." U.S. pension obligations for all publicly traded companies based in the U.S. totaled $1.93 trillion at the end of 2012, up from $1.60 trillion in 2008, according to Mercer. The effect of longer life spans on pension obligations has been dwarfed by the impact of declining interest rates over recent years. Because of the way pension obligations are calculated, lower interest rates means that future obligations are higher today. But interest rates are likely to rise at some point, which will lessen pension obligations. That is less likely with longevity assumptions. "Rates can go up," said Rama Variankaval, an executive director in the corporate finance advisory group of J.P. Morgan Chase

& Co.'s investment bank. "Mortality is more of a one-way street." Individuals face the same problem, Mr. Cadenhead said: "If we're asking them to provide for their own retirement, they're living longer, and it takes more money to provide for their own needs over the course of a lifetime." Joe LaCascia, a 75-year-old retired insurance broker in Polk City, Fla., said he and his wife thought they would have enough savings outside their life insurance policies to last until age 95. Now, he estimates he only has enough to last until they're 85. He said he is more concerned about what the future holds for his children, a 51-year-old art director-turned-roadie and a 49-year-old third-grade teacher. "They're never going to be able to create wealth, other than what our generation leaves them and what they do with it," he said. "They have more uncertainty than we have."

The Obama administration moved to retain some oversight of the way states conduct elections after the Supreme Court invalidated part of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, setting up a new fight with Republican governors. The legal strategy, announced by Attorney General Eric Holder Thursday, is directed initially at Texas' voting procedures, but it promises to have much broader impact: The action in Texas, Mr. Holder said,...

Danone, Yakult, End Strategic Tie-In
By
Kana Inagaki And Ruth Bender Updated April 26, 2013 11:41 a.m. ET
TOKYO—Japanese drinks maker Yakult Honsha Co. and its biggest shareholder Danone SA Friday put an end to their strategic tie-up, replacing it with a looser "cooperation framework" though keeping its joint operations in markets such as India. Under the new agreement, there is no clause limiting or committing Danone to its 20% stakeholding in Yakult, but a Danone spokeswoman said a stake increase in Yakult "isn't on the...

After Sandy flooded Isaiah Scott's luxury apartment building in the Financial District, he sought refuge first with friends and then in Manhattan hotels. In the past week alone, the 23-year-old analyst has lived in five different ones. "It's exhausting," Mr. Scott said. "I'm just not stable." Enlarge Image
Storm victim Lance Stiles and his cat Queenie relocated to a hotel room at Staten Island's Hilton Garden Inn.
Anthony DelMundo for The Wall Street Journal Related In a Hotel Pinch, Aid Workers Go Upscale Some 2,500 hotel and motel rooms in New York and New Jersey are filled with displaced Sandy victims through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the agency said. Untold others, such as Mr. Scott, are paying out of their own pockets or having the expenses covered by employers. The result: Hotels have become makeshift shelters, and unhappily so for people who have to hop from one to the next as availability shifts. Occupancy rates for the Greater New York area in the past two weeks weren't yet available. They declined 7% the week Sandy hit compared with the same week last year, the most recent available figure. But at about 80% that week, the rates are still high compared with the rest of the nation, according to Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn. Some hotels report they are bursting. Hersha Hospitality Management said properties in Queens, Long Island and New Jersey that normally have occupancy rates of 70% to 80% this time of year are close to full. Sandy's Fallout Storm Costs Wreak Havoc With Budgets Long Island Power Chief Quits Brooklyn Tunnel Reopens to Cars Quinn Calls For Sea Wall to Shield City Holding Up in Temporary Digs "What we've seen is people coming in saying they need two to six weeks," said Michael Murray,
chief operating officer of the company, which manages 27 hotels in and near the city. "The lion's share of them probably will get into their homes before year-end, but some of these people could be displaced for months." At two Staten Island hotels, demand for rooms is outstripping supply. The waiting list for the Hilton Garden Inn and Hampton Inn combined is about 40 people long, said owner Richard Nicotra. Last week, that number was more than 100. "People came here and moved in Sunday and Monday before the storm," he said. "They thought, and we thought, they would be going back to their homes." In a disaster, hotels are typically used as a temporary housing solution. "It's often a month to two months max," said Mary Comerio, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley's architecture school and author of "Disaster Hits Home," a book on housing policy for urban disasters. She said usually FEMA works with local housing authorities to try to find more permanent solutions. Still, hotel living can layer uncertainty and anxiety onto an already fraught period. Sandy's path of destruction in the tri-state area has led 390,000 households to request emergency FEMA help of all kinds. "Hotels aren't necessarily built for continued occupancy," said Jan Freitag,
senior vice president of Smith Travel Research. "People who are being displaced are saying, 'I want to stay with you until I don't know when,' and hotels are saying, 'That's not our business model.'" Vanessa Beard knew on Tuesday that she and her four children could stay in a hotel in Edison, N.J. But she said she was unsure FEMA would cover costs beyond that. "We're stuck in limbo," Ms. Beard said. "I have to live with my stuff packed up wondering if I'm going to get a knock on the door saying, 'You have to go.'" A FEMA spokeswoman said the agency doesn't comment on specific cases. Enlarge Image

Anthony DelMundo for The Wall Street Journal There are adjustments. Staten Island resident Tonie Durko has stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn with her two children since Oct. 31, two days after the storm hit. She microwaves most of her meals in the room. Earlier this week, canned food and cups of noodles were piled by a small kitchenette. Folded clothing and towels were stacked on top of chairs and the windowsill. Ms. Durko said she is making it work. But her biggest concern is finding a new home. "I need an apartment," said Ms. Durko, whose home has been red-tagged, or declared unfit for habitation. "I need a place to live." The Hotel Pennsylvania in Midtown, which is currently housing about 150 evacuees and 100 American Red Cross workers, says it is giving priority to those affected by the storm. That means regular guests may be turned away, spokesman Larry Mogelonsky said. "We already have people who are starting to check out," Mr. Mogelonsky said. "What that means, I believe, is that they're able to go back to their apartments. But we're still getting people checking in." There are other temporary options available for those who find hotels unappealing. San Francisco startup Airbnb and New York City joined forces to connect people in need of housing with people who are able to provide it free. More than 700 members have offered to host Sandy victims. Others say a hotel beats crashing on couches. Fund manager Adi Divgi, 33, and his 17-month-old son, his wife and her parents have stayed with family members since the storm hit. After trying to find hotels in Brooklyn and Queens, they managed to secure one in Manhattan. Staying with relatives was simply too crowded, he said. "We'll be living in a hotel starting Wednesday for a week and a half," said the Financial District resident, who'll be staying at Distrikt Hotel in Midtown. After that, he said, "God willing, we'll get something else." Corrections & Amplifications: In the tri-state area, 390,000 households requested aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the wake of superstorm Sandy. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that 390,000 people had sought help from the agency. —Kris Hudson, Heather Haddon, Jennifer Weiss and Joseph De Avila contributed to this article.

MUMBAI—Here on center stage in the global crisis of drug-resistant tuberculosis, top doctors are sounding a new alarm: India's emergency strategy to defeat the disease may be having the opposite effect—encouraging TB instead to mutate into more deadly and unstoppable strains. In its new strategy, India is treating some, and perhaps many, drug-resistant TB patients with drugs that they are already resistant to. That can allow the...
