French Fin Min Sees Lauvergeon Playing 'Major Role' at EADS

By Geraldine Amiel PARIS--France's finance minister Pierre Moscovici Monday said Anne Lauvergeon, the former head of state-controlled nuclear group Areva SA (AREVA.FR), "has all the qualities to play a major role" within the board of Airbus parent, European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. (EADSY). "She's a woman of great qualities which must be used and we wish that they are," Mr. Moscovici said in an interview with France Info radio, confirming reports that the French government wants her to take the helm of EADS. EADS is revamping its board following intense debates in France and Germany over its corporate governance late last year. Under a plan agreed in December that EADS expects to put before shareholders in March, the French and German governments will each hold 12% of the European aerospace group. Under the proposed structure, France and Germany will each nominate three "national security administrators" to EADS to protect interests such as France's ballistic missile program. Two of those people from each country will sit on EADS' board but the governments don't have the right to designate the chairman. Philippe Camus, former top executive at EADS who was seen as a potential contender for the chairman position, Mr. Moscovici said: "I understand he is very busy right now" as chairman of telecom equipment group Alcatel Lucent SA (ALU).
