--CFO Daniel Henry will remain in CFO role until a successor is found --Company conducting an external search for a successor --Planned departure is latest in a series of management announcements for company (Updates with new details throughout.) 
 
   By Andrew R. Johnson and Ben Fox Rubin 
 American Express Co. (AXP) Chief Financial Officer Daniel Henry plans to step down later this year, marking the latest management change for the credit-card company. Mr. Henry, who turns 64 this year, will help in the company's external search for a new CFO, which is expected to take a couple of months, according to a letter sent Tuesday to employees from Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault. He will continue to serve in the position until a successor is in place. Mr. Henry, who joined American Express in 1990 from accounting firm Ernst & Young, has been discussing his plans for the "next chapter of his personal and professional life," Mr. Chenault said. "With our business, balance sheet and 2013 plans in strong shape, we decided that now was the right time to begin the transition." American Express, the largest credit-card lender based on spending, has announced other management changes in recent weeks, including the promotion last month of vice chairman Edward Gilligan to president, a move seen as solidifying his stature as the likely eventual successor to Mr. Chenault. General Counsel Louise Parent also plans to retire later this year, the company said last month. Mr. Henry has been finance chief since 2007, serving as the public face of the company for investors and running the firm's quarterly conference calls in recent years. He is planning a "very active retirement that involves continuing roles on a number of corporate and nonprofit boards," Mr. Chenault said in his letter. Mr. Henry is currently a member of Groupon Inc.'s (GRPN) board of directors and chairs the board of trustees for Molloy College in Rockville Centre, NY. Before becoming CFO, he led American Express' finance team that supported what was then the company's U.S. consumer, small-business and merchant-services group. He also worked for 10 years as the corporate comptroller and oversaw the company's capital-allocation strategy. The credit-card business has performed well in the last two years due in large part to consumers' good payment behavior since the recession. American Express, known for its well-heeled customer base, bounced back from the financial crisis more quickly than its peers did, thanks in large part to its focus on affluent borrowers who use their cards frequently but who typically pay their bills on time. But the company has also been trying to broaden its appeal to attract a younger audience, rolling out prepaid cards that don't require a traditional credit check and are sold in stores including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Target Corp. (TGT). It has also invested in online and mobile technology, including a platform called Serve that allows customers to make purchases using a smartphone application. Last month, the company said its first-quarter earnings rose as it saw an increase in customer card spending, though its provision for losses increased slightly. American Express' shares were flat at $70.06 in recent trading. The shares are up more than 22% this year. Write to Andrew R. Johnson at andrew.r.johnson@dowjones.com.

Rajat Gupta's
impending journey into the federal prison system for criminal insider trading ends a remarkable success story and punctuates his swift fall from grace. A native of Kolkata, Mr. Gupta, 63 years old, moved at a young age to New Delhi. His father, Ashwini, a disciple of Mohandas Gandhi,
was jailed for years in the fight for independence from the British and later was a journalist. His mother, Pran, was a Montessori schoolteacher and principal. AFP/Getty Images More on the Case Read The Journal's previous coverage of developments in the Galleon insider trading case, which exposed links between corporate insiders and a hedge fund that used tips to make profits. The case has yielded several high-profile prosecutions. A Timeline of Rajat Gupta's Career Gupta Sentenced to 2 Years in Prison Gupta Opposes Goldman's Bid for Probe Reimbursement (10/22/12) Prosecutors Seek as Much as Decade in Prison for Gupta (10/17/12) Letters Urge Judge Rakoff to Punish Gupta (10/17/12) Dear Judge, Gupta Is a Good Man (10/12/12) In Gupta Sentencing, a Judgment Call (10/10/12) Both died by the time he was in his teens, his father of tuberculosis contracted in an Indian prison, according to one of Mr. Gupta's daughters. Still, Mr. Gupta thrived both academically and as an anchor for his family. He studied engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, where he was a "a big man on campus, bright, talented, popular," and head of student government, according to his wife, Anita, who met him there taking part in a one-act play in 1968. He wrote his essays to apply to Harvard Business School in a local coffee shop. "It seemed like such a dream," Anita Gupta wrote in a letter last month to the judge who sentenced him Wednesday for giving a hedge-fund manager inside information about Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,

where he was a director. Mr. Gupta agonized when he was accepted to Harvard about leaving his siblings, his wife added, but "decided it was an opportunity he could not afford to miss."

He came to the U.S. in 1971, delivering newspapers at Harvard to help support himself. Two years later, in New York, he broke into McKinsey & Co., a top-tier consulting firm for America's most powerful corporations, and rose through the ranks. At 45, in 1994, Mr. Gupta became the first Indian-born chief of a U.S. international corporation. He served in that role until 2003. Besides breaking ground in the U.S., Mr. Gupta's success inspired people in his home country. McKinsey was one of a few global companies in which many Indians made their careers, but Mr. Gupta blazed the trail for other Indians who joined the small club of multinational CEOs, including former Citigroup Inc.

co-founder Bill Gates
and Hank Paulson, the former Goldman CEO and Treasury Department secretary. Mr. Gupta and his wife were among the list of invited attendees to President Barack Obama's first state dinner, according to a list released by the White House. It was through the creation of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad in the late 1990s that Mr. Gupta met the man who would help bring about his downfall. A mutual friend, Anil Kumar,
asked for donations from Raj Rajaratnam,
founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund, who pledged $1 million, according to testimony at Mr. Gupta's trial. Mr. Rajaratnam was convicted of insider trading last year and sentenced to 11 years in prison. Mr. Kumar, who was Mr. Gupta's protégé at McKinsey, pleaded guilty to giving the Galleon chief unrelated tips, testified at both men's trials and recently received a sentence of probation. Messrs. Rajaratnam and Gupta became friends. The ability to cultivate contacts, along with their South Asian heritage, was a quality Mr. Gupta shared with the 55-year-old Mr. Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan native. Messrs. Gupta and Rajaratnam had vastly different personal styles. The square-jawed Mr. Gupta was quiet and distinguished; Mr. Rajaratnam was rougher around the edges and enjoyed practical jokes, people who know them said. Though Mr. Gupta had a more public persona, the billionaire Mr. Rajaratnam was far richer. Mr. Gupta often would have lunch with Mr. Rajaratnam in the hedge-fund manager's office, ordering Indian or Chinese food. Starting around 2003, he and Mr. Rajaratnam began investing millions of dollars together, according to court documents from his trial, both in vehicles related to Galleon and in an Asia-focused private-equity fund Mr. Gupta had helped to start. In the ensuing years, Mr. Gupta leaked Mr. Rajaratnam inside information, both because of their friendship and business dealings, prosecutors said. They said Mr. Gupta became a "secret pipeline" to Mr. Rajaratnam from 2007 until early 2009 for inside information on the boards of Goldman and Procter & Gamble Co.

at the height of the financial crisis and the investment bank's first quarterly loss as a public company, the government said. After the conviction of Mr. Rajaratnam in May 2011, friends said, Mr. Gupta seemed worried and nervous about his own future. "He was distraught. He seemed upset," Anand "Bill" Julka, a childhood friend, previously told The Wall Street Journal. Six months later, Mr. Gupta was indicted, surrendering to federal agents. He decided to go to trial instead of pleading guilty as many other defendants have, hoping to beat back the largely circumstantial case, sitting straight-backed through the monthlong proceedings, his wife and daughters right behind him. Unlike in the case against Mr. Rajaratnam, prosecutors had only one substantive wiretapped phone call of Mr. Gupta and pieced together the case through phone and trading records. Mr. Gupta's lawyer, Gary Naftalis,
told the jurors who convicted him on four of six counts that Mr. Gupta had no idea about Mr. Rajaratnam's "secret world" of insider trading and argued unsuccessfully that a falling out over a failed investment had negated his motive to leak. Nor did he personally trade on inside information, although prosecutors said he benefited from his business relationships with Mr. Rajaratnam. Mr. Gupta, despite his desire to testify in his own defense, took his lawyers' advice and remained silent. Jurors, some of them shedding tears, ultimately convicted him on three counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. He was acquitted of two counts of securities fraud, including the only one relating to P&G. "We wanted him to walk, go home to his family, live a very prosperous life," juror Ronnie Sesso, a 53-year-old youth advocate in New York, said in an interview after the verdict. "I struggled with everything…but looking at the evidence made it clear." Since then, Mr. Gupta has spent time trying to console his family, helping one daughter rearrange her Boston home. His lawyers sent more than 400 letters seeking leniency to District Judge Jed Rakoff,
from the likes of Mr. Gates, former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
and many others. Mr. Kumar's 25-year-old-son, Aman, who had called Mr. Gupta "Rajat uncle" growing up, wrote one, too. "Often these days, I see my father and notice an unfamiliar look of fear on his face," wrote his daughter Megha. "I'll put my arm on his shoulder and say, 'Don't worry, Baba.' He moves quickly to compose himself: 'I'll be all right, baby. Are you all right?' " Write to Michael Rothfeld at michael.rothfeld@wsj.com Email

The tower reached its zenith nearly nine years after an initial groundbreaking. The building, set to cost $3.9 billion, has been a slow undertaking thanks to a host of delays related to fighting between elected officials, insurance companies, a private developer and others. Security-related design features, including a concrete bunker-like structure at the base, have added to the construction time as well. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images

Workers first began installing the 408-foot steel mast in December, hoisting 18 separate pieces up to the top. Two tower cranes were installed simply for the mast. The steel alone cost $10 million, according to the Port Authority, with additional costs for labor. Reuters

The structure is slated to serve as a broadcast antenna, a service that the initial World Trade Center also served. After the Twin Towers were destroyed in 2001, broadcasters moved to the Empire State Building in Midtown, which hosts a large portion of the New York broadcast market. The antenna was initially slated to have a white shell encasing the mechanical equipment, a component that was removed last year. The decision will leave the infrastructure exposed, a move that has irked the building's lead designer, David Childs. Associated Press

One World Trade Center stood at 1,368 feet tall without its crowning feature. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat hasn't yet determined whether to count the topping feature toward the building's height. The tallest building in the Western Hemisphere currently is the Willis Tower in Chicago, while the record for tallest overall goes to the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Reuters

The tower and ascending mast were visible from the waterfront. The beacon was moved to the top of the building for installation a week after officials discovered a piece of plane wreckage believed to be from one of the passenger jets used in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, about 1,230 feet from where the towers stood.
