Eike Batista modera sus ambiciones en medio de dudas sobre sus metas

Por LUCIANA MAGALHÃES, PAULO WINTERSTEIN e MATTHEW COWLEY SÃO PAULO—El extravagante magnate brasileño Eike Batista levantó un imperio desde cero, recaudando miles de millones de dólares a través de ofertas de acciones y acumulando deuda, a medida que la mayor economía de América Latina se expandía rápidamente.
Pero en los últimos nueve meses, tras perder dos terceras partes de su fortuna, la ambición de Batista de convertirse en el hombre más rico del mundo ha quedado en suspenso. Y como consecuencia, su credibilidad ahora está en entredicho. Enlarge ImageClose
Bloomberg
Los últimos meses han puesto en entredicho la credibilidad de Eike Batista.
Entre 2006 y 2010, Batista recaudó miles de millones de dólares para financiar nuevas compañías en industrias intensivas en capital como la minera, la petrolera y la portuaria, ya que sus ideas apelaban a una nación que necesitaba infraestructura. Sólo en 2011 y 2012, su holding EBX Group invirtió un total de US$15.700 millones.
Sin embargo, ahora crecen las dudas sobre la capacidad de Batista para cumplir con sus ambiciosas metas para terminar enormes proyectos. Las pérdidas combinadas de sus empresas se más que duplicaron en 2012, a US$1.250 millones, calcula la consultora Economática.
Para demostrar que sus detractores están equivocados y asegurar la viabilidad a largo plazo de su imperio, Batista está buscando nuevos socios y financiación adicional, a veces vendiendo participaciones. Recientemente, el empresario defendió su conglomerado en Twitter diciendo que la gente que apostaba en su contra "se vería sorprendida con los pantalones bajados".
La semana pasada, Batista anunció la venta de casi la mitad de su participación de 53,9% en la compañía eléctrica MPX Energia SA a la alemana E.ON SE, que ya tenía 10% de MPX. El acuerdo, valorado en al menos US$700 millones, podría ser el primero en una serie de operaciones del empresario para tratar de restaurar la confianza en su conglomerado, aseguran fuentes cercanas.En una reciente llamada de resultados financieros, Roberto Monteiro, el director financiero de OGX Petróleo e Gás Participações SA, la empresa insignia de Batista, reconoció que están explorando "alternativas" por si deciden recaudar capital para poder participar en una subasta de licencias de exploración de petróleo en Brasil. Una opción sería vender participaciones en algunos de los bloques de exploración y yacimientos petroleros existentes de la compañía, señaló Monteiro. "Aún tenemos varias opciones abiertas", añadió.
En marzo, Batista firmó una alianza estratégica con André Esteves, que dirige el banco de inversión Banco BTG Pactual SA, asegurándose así tanto una línea de crédito de US$1.000 millones como su apoyo gerencial, conforme EBX Group emprende un nuevo rumbo.Esteves declinó ofrecer comentarios pero, en una entrevista con el periódico brasileño O Estado de São Paulo, dijo que el problema no es la deuda de EBX sino la necesidad de financiar futuras inversiones y esto tiene que resolverse proyecto por proyecto. Batista ha sumado socios a sus proyectos, aunque hasta ahora estas alianzas han sido relativamente limitadas, como una inversión de US$300 millones en mayo de 2012 en EBX por parte de General Electric Co. Lo que se vislumbra ahora es algo mucho más extenso.A mediados de junio de 2012, se desencadenó una crisis de credibilidad cuando OGX decepcionó a los inversionistas con una producción en sus primeros pozos mucho menor a la prevista. Debido a los fuertes vínculos entre las empresas que componen el conglomerado EBX Group, ese problema tiene un impacto generalizado: la filial de astilleros, OSX Brasil SA, producirá plataformas petroleras para OGX, mientras que OSX está ubicada dentro del complejo del puerto Açu que está siendo construido por LLX Logística SA (Lea más sobre este proyecto en esta página).Hijo de Eliezer Batista da Silva, ex ministro de Minería y ex presidente del gigante minero Vale SA, Batista llegó a ser el séptimo empresario más rico del mundo; con frecuencia alardeaba de que conquistaría la corona. Su patrimonio neto pasó de US$7.500 millones en 2009 a US$30.000 millones en 2011. Pero para marzo de este año, se había encogido a US$10.600 millones, colocándolo en el puesto 100, según el ranking de la revista Forbes.Seis de las compañías principales de EBX Group cotizan en bolsa. Conforme la confianza ha ido menguando, las acciones han empezado a tambalearse. Ahora, el grupo cuenta con entre 60% y 70% de las acciones en sus filiales. Con el acuerdo de la semana pasada, la participación en MPX se reducirá a aproximadamente 24%.
Los detractores del magnate argumentan que sus firmas quizás prometieron de más, tal como sugieren los problemas de producción en OGX. Aseguran que las empresas se han vuelto demasiado dependientes de los mercados de capital. Las acciones de OGX acumulan una caída de 46% desde comienzos del año. El grupo debe más de 10.000 millones de reales (US$4.950 millones) a algunos de los mayores bancos de Brasil, incluyendo Banco Itaú Unibanco SA, Banco Bradesco SA y Banco BTG Pactual SA, según tres banqueros.

Why Bezos's Drone Is More Than a Joke

Updated Dec. 5, 2013 4:28 p.m. ET
Let's get this out of the way first: Jeff Bezos's announcement that Amazon.com Inc. is working on a way to deliver goods by unmanned aircraft was little more than puffery—a brilliantly wafted bit of vaporware that, like a lone drone making its way across a bleak landscape, arrived at its destination beautifully intact. Though Mr. Bezos has no idea when drone delivery will become operational—the plan is blocked by U.S. regulation and is both technologically and economically questionable—his unveiling of the project on...

Son of Citizens United
Democratic angst returns over campaign spending by normal people. Updated Oct. 9, 2013 7:04 p.m. ET
Crank up the Democratic angst. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court's Justices heard oral argument in McCutcheon v. FEC, the campaign-finance case billed as the blockbuster sequel to 2010's Citizens United. The Court seemed skeptical of the current aggregate limits on contributions to candidates but more wary of lifting aggregate limits on political parties or revisiting 1976's Buckley v. Valeo. The case was brought by Shaun McCutcheon, an Alabama businessman who donated below the legal limit to a number of candidates and...

Studios Unlock DVD Release Dates
Movie Makers, Theater Owners Discuss Experimenting With Time Frames for Videos
By
Ethan Smith and Lauren A. E. Schuker Updated Feb. 12, 2010 12:01 a.m. ET
The coming release of Walt Disney Co.'s "Alice in Wonderland" might serve as a looking glass into the movie industry's future. Instead of releasing the DVD 16 and a half weeks after the movie opens in theaters, Disney plans to put it out after just 12 and a half weeks, even if it is still playing at the multiplex. The scheduling change is among the first examples of an informal new agreement U.S. theater owners are...

Updated Oct. 21, 2011 6:34 p.m. ET
ST. LOUIS—Someone get Gov. Rick Perry
off the campaign trail and summon the spirit of LBJ. The Texas Rangers are alive. Three outs from falling into an ugly two-game hole in the World Series for a second consecutive year, the Rangers scratched out two ninth-inning runs to eke out a 2-1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals and even this best-of-seven series as it heads to Texas this weekend. Albert Pujols
misplayed a throw from the outfield, allowing Josh Hamilton
and Michael Young
to hit consecutive sacrifice flies that gave the Rangers the comeback win as the Cardinal bullpen failed to secure a lead that would have given their team a stranglehold on this series. Enlarge Image
Elvis Andrus scoring the go-ahead run in the ninth
Rob Carr/Getty Images "Momentum tends to shift game to game in the postseason," Young said. "We won tonight's game, it was big for us—heading back to Arlington's going to be a blast. Our crowd goes bananas in the postseason." Baseball will do this. A game and a series can turn in an instant, and that's just what happened on a night that seemed like it would belong to the two starting pitchers—who gave up one run combined through the first seven innings—or a pinch-hitter named Allen Craig,
whom the Rangers can't seem to get out. Instead, Ian Kinsler
opened the ninth inning with a bloop single, stole second, scrambled to third on a base hit by Elvis Andrus,
then scurried home on Hamilton's sacrifice fly. A batter later, Andrus scored on Young's fly, and after closer Neftali Feliz
came on for the save, the Rangers had the split they came here for. "We played nine innings, and tonight was proof of the type of team we are," Rangers manager Ron Washington
said. "We've got a lot of character in that clubhouse." For the Cardinals, the loss was heartbreaking. Pujols, whose misplay in the ninth inning cost his team the game, left the stadium minutes after the final out and before his clubhouse opened to the media. Centerfielder Jon Jay,
who made the throw from the outfield that Pujols failed to cut off, said he tried to keep the ball low but it sailed away from Pujols as it arrived in the infield. "We both told each other we should have done a little better," Jay said. Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa,
whose magic touch eluded him as closer Jason Motte
let up consecutive singles to start the ninth inning, chalked up the loss to bad luck and a gutsy Rangers effort. "They played a classic ninth inning," he said. "I tip my cap to them." Until that inning, the night's big hit belonged to the Cardinals' Craig. For the second consecutive night, he pinch-hit for a starter on a roll and smacked a single into right field off Alexi Ogando
to drive home the go-ahead run in the seventh inning. The run was the lone mark against Rangers starter Colby Lewis,
who in a near-flawless performance went six and two-thirds innings and gave up just four hits. Lewis was almost as good as his Cardinals counterpart Jaime Garcia,
who went seven innings and gave up just three hits. Craig, an eighth-round draft choice in 2006 out of Chaparral High School in Temecula, Calif., isn't a youngster at 27. He spent five seasons in the minors and hit below .300 just once. In his second year in the Majors, he's the sort of player who could probably have a beer in any Major League city, perhaps even his own, without being recognized. Those days are over, at least in St. Louis. Though he played in just 75 games this season, he hit .315, then he hit .375 with a home run and drove in three runs in the National League Championships Series. With the lineup including a designated hitter in Texas, Craig has likely earned the start. "I'm not going to be thinking about what I did the first two games when I'm in Texas," he said. Certainly Rangers pitchers will, even if their heady ninth inning got them out of this baseball-crazy city without having to pray for a miracle in their home ballpark. The Rangers averaged 5.28 runs per game this season but have managed just four in two World Series games. Their bats have gone cold in the chilly St. Louis nights. Of course top-of-the line pitching will do that. For fans of crisp, quick, old-style pitcher's duels backed up with classy defense, Game 2 was one to cherish, the sort of edge-of-your-seat baseball that all but disappeared during those years when a 50-home run seasons became routine. In addition to his clutch single, Andrus, the Rangers' shortstop, turned in the fielding gem of the game with two out in the sixth inning and runners on first and second. Rafael Furcal
smacked a hard grounder up the middle. Andrus went to his knees on the edge of the outfield grass to glove the ball. His only chance was to flip it with the webbing to Kinsler, who beat the runner to second by a half-step for the force out. "I'm a pretty even-keeled guy, but I gave it a fist-pump," Lewis said of the play. "I was pretty excited for it." He should have been; the run it saved proved to be the difference. "In a one-run game, it's one hit, one bad pitch that makes the difference," said Motte, who was snakebit by Kinsler's bloop single. "The ball was down, but obviously it wasn't down enough." —Daniel Barbarisi contributed to this story. Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com Email

Maryland lawyer Dana Moylan Wright was trapped in a vicious cycle. The more her work piled up, the less she wanted to do it. "At that point, I had many deadlines and was having trouble making myself do anything," she says. "My anxiety level would absolutely soar." Edel Rodriguez One day in 2005, Ms. Wright, 42, was surfing the Web, avoiding several pressing matters. She searched "procrastination," seeking an antidote. Instead, she found a way to exploit her habit: "structured procrastination." The brainchild of Stanford University philosophy professor John Perry, structured procrastination involves doing small, low-priority tasks to build a sense of accomplishment and the energy to tackle more important jobs. Mr. Perry, a chronic procrastinator, suggests followers choose an important task, but defer work on it while tackling others. "Don't be ashamed of self-manipulation," he says. Too often, Mr. Perry says, people focus on their biggest and most important duties, then waste time on unproductive tasks -- like surfing the Web and watching television. His Web site, structuredprocrastination.com, features a picture of the author "jumping rope with seaweed while work awaits." He suggests procrastinators fill their time with less formidable -- and more useful -- assignments, such as following up with clients, completing expense reports or catching up on industry news. He says the smart procrastinator can earn a reputation for productivity while giving in to the urge to delay. What about the big jobs? Mr. Perry says either a non-negotiable deadline will force action, or the procrastinator will gather enough information and perspective to make them appear less daunting. Professor Perry advocates structured procrastination.
Courtesy Mr. Perry Mr. Perry's theory, based on personal experience rather than rigorous science, comes amid growing research on the psychological roots of procrastination and its economic cost. Psychologists who study procrastination estimate that 80% to 95% of college students procrastinate, and half do so routinely; between 15% and 20% of adults are habitual procrastinators. Piers Steel, an associate professor at the University of Calgary and author of the forthcoming book "The Procrastination Equation," estimates that procrastination costs the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Mr. Steel says the computer games Minesweeper and Solitaire alone probably account for billions in lost time and productivity. While there is neither a single explanation for why people procrastinate nor a single recommendation for how to overcome the behavior, suggestions include goal setting, or breaking down large tasks into a series of smaller ones, and energy regulation -- that is, planning to tackle difficult tasks at the time of day when one's energy level is highest, often around 10 a.m. Some authors promote sophisticated time-management and organizational systems. Others urge procrastinators to focus on positive goals, like professional advancement or more family time. Dana Wright says structured procrastination has worked for her.
Courtesy Dana Wright "There are no positives to procrastination," says Timothy Pychyl, director of the Procrastination Research Group at Canada's Carleton University. Nonetheless, Mr. Pychyl enjoys Mr. Perry's irreverent approach and suggests it may sometimes be useful. "It's not going to solve everybody's problems, but ... some people probably can get a lot done while avoiding other things," he says. Ms. Wright, the Maryland lawyer, says structured procrastination has helped her focus and tackle tasks more deliberately and efficiently. "As long as I can feel like there's something I'm avoiding, then I can get myself to work," she says. Temitope Koledoye, a Philadelphia marketing director, says the technique helps her create "mental space" between herself and big projects and cope with attention deficit disorder, with which she was diagnosed in 2003. "While I'm doing all of those minuscule activities, I'm still thinking about the big thing I have to do," she says. "I'm consolidating my thoughts." Small accomplishments, like paying bills online or packing for a business trip, provide moments of satisfaction throughout her day, she says. "You don't feel like a failure because you are getting things done. It makes life a lot more manageable." Mr. Perry says procrastinators shouldn't waste time feeling bad about their work habits because guilt saps motivation, reinforcing the desire to delay. Juanjo de Regules of Mexico City, who has sought therapy for his aversion to work, says he felt "a lot less guilty" after reading the Stanford professor's essays. A former human-resources director for a Mexican construction company, Mr. de Regules says for years he relied on employees to help him tackle dreaded tasks, a strategy he playfully calls "leadership by procrastination." Mr. de Regules left his former employer in April to run his own software business. He credits Mr. Perry with providing him a framework for procrastinating more productively. "I feel good, I make money, and I still procrastinate," Mr. de Regules says. Write to Cari Tuna at cari.tuna@wsj.com
