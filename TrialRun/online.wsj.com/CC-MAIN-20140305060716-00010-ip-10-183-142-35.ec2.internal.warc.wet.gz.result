O clássico banco e preto volta de cara nova ao mundo da moda

Por CHRISTINA BINKLEY
Está bem claro, preto no branco. Seja em listas tipo presidiário, xadrez com quadrados grandes, ou em conjuntos inspirados no bom e velho smoking, as combinações de preto com branco serão o look mais charmoso da próxima temporada.

Desfile da grife de Marc Jacobs para a temporada de primavera de 2013
O estilista Marc Jacobs ficou louco pelo preto e branco nas suas coleções de primavera, mostrando uma versão psicodélica das listras para a grife que leva seu nome e usando xadrez em vários tamanhos em seus designs para a Louis Vuitton. Ambas as coleções estão sendo consideradas das mais memoráveis de Jacobs.
Uma quantidade tão grande de grifes, de Calvin Klein e Alexander Wang até Balenciaga e Givenchy, apresentou looks em preto e branco para as férias e a primavera que as revistas de moda já estão martelando essa ideia nas leitoras. As edições americanas de fim de ano da "Vogue", "Elle" e "Harper's Bazaar" estão atulhadas de fotos de moda em preto e branco.

Coleção de primavera 2013 de Marc Jacobs
"É ótimo que algo tão clássico seja de repente tão avançado", diz a estilista Penny Lovell, de Los Angeles, cuja clientela inclui Keira Knightley e Diane Kruger. Muitas mulheres já têm armários cheios de roupas pretas e roupas brancas.
A dupla preto e branco é uma dessas tendências que ganham aceitação de tantos estilistas que a gente fica pensando, quem será que deu essa ordem geral? Sharon Graubard, diretora de moda para a consultoria Stylesight, diz que a tendência pode ter se originado de algumas memoráveis coleções da primavera de 2012, incluindo as de Marni, Rick Owens e, especialmente, Phoebe Philo para Céline.
Os looks inteiramente brancos de Philo, sobretudo com sapatos pretos fortes, foram considerados muito influentes. "Acho que a coisa do preto e branco vem se infiltrando", diz Graubard.

Sapato da nova coleção de Stuart Weitzman
Às vezes, uma moda dá a impressão de ser perfeitamente acertada para a sua época. O preto simboliza elegância e poder, enquanto o branco sugere pureza e simplicidade. As consumidoras de moda adotaram ambos os temas – yin e yang – desde a crise financeira de 2008.
Há ciência na maneira como os amantes da moda se envolvem com essa nova tendência. O forte contraste entre o preto e o branco estimula o cérebro, diz Caroline Winnett, diretora de marketing da Nielsen NeuroFocus. O grupo de consultoria, comprado no ano passado pela Nielsen Co., estuda a maneira como os consumidores reagem neurologicamente aos estímulos do mercado, e acompanha o surgimento das tendências.
Além do mais, os elementos gráficos de muitas estampas são estimulantes para o cérebro. Essa é uma razão pela qual as lojas de artigos infantis estão cheias de cubos em preto e branco para pendurar acima do berço.

"O cérebro se diverte processando não só as cores como também as formas", diz Winnett, observando que são áreas diferentes do cérebro que reagem às formas e às cores. É por isso que aquelas listras da Marc Jacobs nos despertaram tanto. "Com esse tipo de coisa você se envolve mais", diz ela.
O designer de sapatos Stuart Weitzman diz que no verão passado se inspirou na lembrança de um velho par de sapatos de duas cores, que ele atualizou com salto alto. O modelo estará nas lojas em fevereiro.
É um bom contraste, diz ele, com tantos padrões florais da última primavera.

"Nós aprendemos", diz ele, "que uma nova moda não evolui a partir da moda do ano passado".
Mas a tendência do preto e branco não é tão simples quanto parece. Para muitas mulheres, ela apresenta um enigma: Como fazer uma blusa branca com calça preta parecer uma nova moda?
Muitas vezes o novo preto e branco pode ter algo inovador. Por exemplo, complete a dupla com um acessório um tanto surpreendente em preto e branco, como um cinto branco, uma bolsa em preto e branco ou sapatos baixos de duas cores. Os acessórios brancos podem acrescentar um elemento inesperado a um traje todo preto.

Mas não é preciso exagerar. Uma blusa branca bem passada e bem engomada e uma calça preta justa (talvez com meias brancas e sapatos pretos tipo Oxford) já têm impacto – especialmente se as peças forem bem cortadas e as formas, elegantes. A silhueta de hoje envolve uma saia mais longa e calça justa, ou então com as pernas bem largas e cintura alta. Ganha pontos um tecido diferente, tal como uma saia de pele de cobra.
É ótimo acrescentar um toque de uma cor viva e profunda, como bordô ou verde esmeralda. Mantenha a cor em uma só área do seu corpo, de modo que pareça intencional. (Evite misturar vermelho vivo com o look smoking, a menos que você queira fazer o gênero mordomo chique.)
A forma mais em voga de compor esse look é investir em algumas estampas gráficas – como listras, xadrez de vários tamanhos e tipos e outros desenhos – que estão sendo vistos em camisas, calças, saias e até sapatos e bolsas. Enlarge ImageClose

A visão clássica do branco e preto de Ralph Lauren para a primavera 2013 Uma batelada dessas estampas chamativas em preto e branco vai começar a chegar às lojas americanas em janeiro e fevereiro. São desenhos que podem dar mais tempero e mais dinamismo a uma roupa, e a combinação das cores pode ficar melhor nas mulheres que se sentem muito apagadas usando só preto ou só branco.
Lovell adverte que o estilo preto e branco gráfico "não precisa de muitas joias. Mantenha a simplicidade". E ela rejeita o tradicional tabu contra as listras horizontais, dizendo que o que dá certo "depende do corte da roupa".
Outra estilista, Laura Jones, diz que gosta de vestir sua cliente Alicia Keys "nesse look preto e branco, pois é um estilo clean", meio minimalista. Mas não use uma estampa viva da cabeça aos pés, adverte Jones, "a menos que você esteja preparada para assumir mesmo". A combinação de calça preta com camisa branca, tipo smoking, tem um ar de vanguarda. As melhores fazem uma versão mais exagerada e divertida daquilo que Cary Grant sabia vestir tão bem – como jeans e uma jaqueta justa. Mas quer você use tecido jeans, crepe ou lã, conserve o contraste ao estilo pinguim.
"Você tem muita liberdade", diz Jones. "São duas cores que combinam de qualquer maneira, então se dá para brincar com a silhueta." Copyright 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Companies are taking advantage of investors' appetite for yield—and fear of riskier bets—by issuing more long-term bonds, aiming to reduce their refinancing needs in coming years, when interest rates are likely to be higher. Investment-grade companies have sold more 30-year bonds in the U.S. so far in 2012 than in any full year since 1995, according to data provider Dealogic. The $91.9 billion of 30-year bonds sold in 166 offerings this year, is about 26% more than the $73.2 billion sold in 145 deals during all of 2011. Issuers are being drawn to the longer maturities by low interest rates, the result of the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policy and the global economy's continuing weakness. For investors, the longer maturities provide better returns than shorter-term debt without the default worries associated with the high-yielding debt of some of Europe's troubled economies. However, more long-term debt issuance now could limit the supply of bonds in the future, meaning investors will need to find other places to put their cash. For corporations, there is a sense that now is as good a time as any to raise debt, particularly as the near-term economic outlook dims. That view helped make September the second busiest month for 30-year issuance this year, with 24 companies raising $12.3 billion. "No treasurer or CFO wants to be the one treasurer or CFO who didn't get cheap long-term money when it was available," says Mark Gray,
an analyst with Moody's Investors Service. Among those tapping the market was United Parcel Service Inc.

On Sept. 24, UPS refinanced $1.75 billion of five-year bonds coming due in January 2013 through a three-part bond deal, including $375 million of 30-year bonds that paid 3.625% annually. The timing of the deal "was a combination of the current credit market and looking at avoiding fourth-quarter uncertainty," said UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg.
Ms. Rosenberg said that there was seven times the demand for the bonds than the amount available. She added that the company wanted to raise the funds ahead of any disruption to the economy caused by government negotiations over tax and spending cuts. The corporate-debt market is enticing many companies that haven't issued long-dated bonds for years. General Electric Co.

jumped in on Oct. 1, selling $7 billion of bonds, including $2 billion of 30-year bonds. Although GE's finance arm, GE Capital, is a frequent bond issuer, the recent offering was the first by the parent company in five years. The company plans to use part of the proceeds to refinance $5 billion of debt coming due in February 2013. A GE spokesman said the issuance was consistent with its strategy of being "opportunistic in accessing markets and prefunding maturities, particularly with interest rates at historically low levels."

sold $1 billion of 30-year bonds for its NBCUniversal subsidiary, with a 4.45% rate, compared with rates ranging between 6.5% and 7% for 30-year bonds Comcast sold in past years. That difference represents an annual interest-payment savings of roughly $20 million on $1 billion of debt. Investor demand for corporate bonds has narrowed their spread with benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasurys. The spread measures how risky investors consider the bonds relative to U.S. Treasurys, which are considered among the safest investments. On Thursday, the spread between 30-year Treasurys, which yielded 2.89%, and 30-year corporate debt was 1.83 percentage points, the lowest since Aug. 10, 2011, according to S&P Capital IQ's Leveraged Commentary & Data unit. The tighter spread suggests investors see less risk in corporate bonds. The low yields present a problem to investors, because they are buying bonds at historically high prices that will fall if the Fed begins raising interest rates. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates. However, bond-fund managers have little choice but to buy the debt, if they can, especially when highly regarded issuers like GE re-enter the market. Investment-grade companies have been very stable lately. Moody's Mr. Gray said that only four companies have suffered ratings downgrades since July, "which speaks to the fact that things are pretty stable out there." He added that the long-term issuance is a positive for companies. "If a company can lock in cheap long-term money for a refinancing, it takes maturity risk out of the equation for a long time. Over the near term it gives a company breathing room," Mr. Gray said. The demand is making it easy for companies to come to market, particularly those with the higher ratings. "Whether you're mid-BBB or mid-A, if you're a solid, large market cap company in a noncyclical industry, you've got very, very good access," said one investment-grade bond banker.

Karzai Demands U.S. Troop Pullback
Afghan Leader Wants Troops Out of Villages; Washington Says It Won't Alter Plans
By
Yaroslav Trofimov And Julian E. Barnes Updated March 15, 2012 8:34 p.m. ET
KABUL—The U.S. suffered a major blow in Afghanistan as President Hamid Karzai made a surprise demand that the American-led coalition pull its troops from villages back to bases, opening a new rift that threatens the U.S. strategy in the country. U.S. officials said they are planning no changes in deployments, however, and played down Mr. Karzai's request, which came as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta left Kabul after meetings...

Bonds could be among the worst-performing investments this year, says Jane Williams,
chief executive officer of wealth-management firm Sand Hill Advisors LLC in Palo Alto, Calif. Ms. Williams expects that bond prices—which move inversely to interest rates—will fall later this year as rates rise. The Journal Report See the complete Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis report.
"We don't have great expectations from the fixed-income side of [clients'] portfolios," says Ms. Williams. She says that while the Federal Reserve is being careful about not raising interest rates too soon—lest it stymie the nascent economic recovery—rates can't stay forever at their current near-zero levels, as that could cause inflation. This column focuses on model portfolios from prominent financial advisers who invest primarily in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Ms. Williams co-founded Sand Hill in 1982, and the firm now manages around $1 billion for very wealthy individuals, as well as foundations and endowments. Ms. Williams has been named in a list of top financial advisers in the U.S. by Barron's magazine (published by News Corp.'s

Dow Jones & Co., which also publishes The Wall Street Journal). The advisers at Sand Hill note that investors who have been piling into bonds lately should not expect a repeat of last year's double-digit returns. The average intermediate-term-bond mutual fund gained 14% in 2009, while riskier funds that focus on junk bonds and emerging-market bonds gained an average of 47% and 32%, respectively, according to Morningstar Inc.

At Sand Hill, advisers have been expecting an interest-rate increase since late 2008, given the Fed's low benchmark rate. This year, the advisers expect bonds to provide single-digit or even negative returns, depending on how much interest rates rise. (It's possible that prices will fall, but that those losses will be smaller than the interest paid by the bonds, producing small positive total returns.) Last fall, Sara Craven,
a senior portfolio manager, cut back on clients' exposure to junk bonds, which she had bought in late 2007. After their double-digit returns, Ms. Craven felt they had run their course. She cut back on foreign-bond allocations for the same reason. In recent weeks, both of these types of bonds have fallen in price as investors have shied away from risk, such as the escalating financial troubles in Europe. Here, the advisers share a balanced portfolio for clients with a moderate risk appetite. It returned 25% for the year ended Dec. 31, and 3% annualized for the five years ended that date. U.S STOCKS: Ms. Williams is optimistic about stocks for the year, but says "there's going to be choppiness." She adds, however, that this volatility is selectively creating some opportunities to buy stocks. Enlarge Image

Cynthia Larson/CP Larson Photography The model portfolio currently has an allocation of 41% to U.S. stocks, using a combination of actively managed mutual funds, where a fund manager makes bets on stocks that he thinks will beat the market, and passive funds, which don't aim to beat an index. The advisers believe that some parts of the stock market, like shares in large U.S. companies, are "efficient," meaning there aren't too many price discrepancies that can be seized. The advisers figure it's best to get exposure to these markets through an index fund or ETF, or another passive fund, which is typically much cheaper than an actively managed fund. They use several funds from Dimensional Fund Advisors, an Austin, Texas, firm that uses computerized screening to identify groups of shares with certain risk and return metrics. The portfolio's 28% allocation to U.S. large companies is in the DFA U.S. Large Company
fund. For clients with more than $1 million in assets, which is the majority of Sand Hill clients, the advisers currently invest half of the large-company allocation into a portfolio of 20 to 30 individual, dividend-paying stocks, which they believe will perform better than the broad market. For their allocation to midsize and small companies, the advisers invest 5% each in the iShares S&P MidCap 400 Index

ETF and DFA U.S. Small Cap.
Since the advisers believe there are some inefficiencies in small-company stocks, they also use an actively managed fund, Longleaf Partners Small-Cap,
which gets 3%. FOREIGN STOCKS: The 13% allocation to foreign stocks is devoted to DFA funds that focus on buying cheap, or "value," stocks. The advisers put 7% in large- company stocks of developed countries, through DFA International Value,
and 3% each in DFA International Small Cap Value
and DFA Emerging Markets Value.
Ms. Williams hopes to increase the overall allocation to foreign stocks in the future. BONDS: The portfolio's current 30% allocation to bonds is on the lower end of the advisers' allocation range for this asset class. When Sand Hill's advisers are bullish on bonds, the allocation can be as high as 39%. Twelve percent of the overall portfolio is split between funds that buy high-quality intermediate-term bonds, Pimco Total Return and Vanguard Total Bond Market Index.
An additional 6% goes to Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade,
which buys short-term bonds. The portfolio also has 4% in an ETF that buys Treasury inflation-protected securities, iShares Barclays TIPS Bond.

There is a 4% allocation to junk bonds, made through Pimco High Yield.
Another 4% is allocated to foreign bonds, split between BlackRock International Bond
and Pimco Emerging Local Bond.
The advisers didn't completely eliminate their allocations to junk bonds and emerging-market bonds, because these pay higher coupons than high-quality U.S. bonds. Also, foreign bonds provide currency diversification. (Two percent of the portfolio is in cash.) ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS: This allocation has gone up over the years and now stands at 14%. In recent years, the Sand Hill advisers have started using some mutual funds that aim to perform like hedge funds.The advisers expect these funds to earn returns in the mid to high single digits, but with less risk than the broad stock market. They could be an "imperfect surrogate to fixed income," says Tyler Scott,
a senior portfolio manager. The portfolio has 4% in such funds, divided between Arbitrage Fund,
which bets on mergers and acquisitions, and Goldman Sachs Absolute Return Tracker,
which aims to replicate the returns of a hedge-fund index by investing in instruments like derivatives and ETFs. The remaining 10% alternatives allocation is in real estate and commodities. The advisers put 3% in DFA Real Estate Securities
and 2% in DFA International Real Estate Securities.
For the 5% commodity allocation, the advisers hold 3% in Pimco CommodityRealReturn Strategy,
which invests in commodity futures and other such instruments, and 2% in RS Global Natural Resources,
which buys stocks of companies involved in commodities. —Ms. Anand is a personal-finance columnist for The Wall Street Journal, based in New Delhi. Email: shefali.anand@wsj.com.

A North Korean envoy gave Chinese President Xi Jinping a handwritten letter from Kim Jong Un on Friday and said Pyongyang wanted to solve diplomatic issues through dialogue, Chinese state media reported.

France's privacy watchdog said Monday it and an unspecified number of other European regulators want to coordinate a "repressive action" against Google, after the company had failed to give "precise and effective" answers to a warning that all 27 EU national regulators issued in October. The full group of privacy regulators, known as the Article 29 group, is scheduled to vote on the proposal at the end of February. Led by France's Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés, or CNIL, the group said in October that Google's treatment of user data doesn't comply with European law. They recommended that Google implement a list of changes—such as easier opt-outs for targeted advertising—to get back in line. Google said Monday that its policy complies with European law. "We have engaged fully with the CNIL throughout this process and will continue to do so," said a Google spokesman. More EU Agencies Seek Google Privacy Changes (10/15/2012) Google Defends New Privacy Policy (1/31/2012) The clash over Google's privacy policy, which lets the search giant mix data between services like Gmail and YouTube, highlights how Europe's data-privacy agencies are looking to assert themselves against Web giants. Leaders of the national privacy commissions have said they hope to set a global example for the treatment of personal data, and have mounted inquiries into Google and Facebook Inc.

among others. The Wall Street Journal "We're better armed when we speak with one voice than when each country takes its own steps," Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin,
head of the CNIL, said in an interview Monday. Ms. Falque-Pierrotin said it was too early to say what form any coordinated enforcement action against Google might take, but she said Monday's declaration indicated that the CNIL and other regulators were ready to impose sanctions. Penalties for violating data-protection rules vary by country, with French fines reaching as high as €300,000 ($401,000) for repeat infractions. The current fight dates back to early 2012, when Google said it would change its privacy policy for its various services—such as email and YouTube—to allow them to share data. France led an inquiry into the policy on behalf of its European colleagues, and in October said it would give Google about three to four months to make some specific changes, but stopped short of ordering a full rollback of the policy. Google says it responded in a letter in early January with a list of some actions it had taken in response, as well as a request for a meeting to discuss other elements of its response. Ms. Falque-Pierrotin said the letter hadn't been specific about the actions Google had taken, and that the request for a meeting has been referred to the full group of EU regulators.

U.S. health-care spending grew at a record low pace for a third consecutive year in 2011, according to federal figures released Monday, but signs are emerging that the slow growth may not last. National health expenditures rose 3.9% in 2011, the same rate as in 2009 and 2010, when people cut back on their use of medical services amid the economic downturn. The figures were the slowest growth in the 52 years that government actuaries...

The answer: Mary Jo White, the former prosecutor who has been a big shot at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP for a decade and was nominated by President Barack Obama on Thursday to lead the Securities and Exchange...

DAMASCUS, Syria—The government here viewed a Russian proposal for Syria to hand over its chemical weapons to an international body as a major tactical victory in the face of a looming U.S.-led attack.

Biography
Updated Sept. 4, 2013 11:39 p.m. ET
Dave Cutler First-year M.B.A. students are arriving on campus this fall with fading tans, first-day-of-class jitters and, increasingly, summer internship offers. Companies eager to capture top talent are starting the recruiting process even earlier—in some instances before the school year begins. Business schools have responded by pushing forward the dates they allow firms to begin corporate presentations, cocktail receptions and other recruiting activities, despite concerns that the students aren't adequately prepared to face the onslaught. Formal interviews are still generally delayed until January for those students who don't get an early offer by less traditional means. "I wish we could ask the companies not to engage with our students as early," says Wendy Tsung,
associate dean of M.B.A. career services at Emory University's Goizueta Business School. "But the companies are either going to go around us or they're going to work with us. We'd much rather that they work with us." Schools try to restrict when companies can start coming to campus. But that doesn't limit what companies try to do off-campus, and it's not uncommon for students to show up at orientation with internship offers for next summer in hand. Melissa Korn reports on the News Hub. Photo: AP.
This year the business school's networking event, which draws more than 20 companies, was on Aug. 23. It used to be held in October. Corporate presentations at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business for first-year students begin Sept. 16; the school moved its start date up by a week in 2012. While the trend suggests strong demand for M.B.A.s, school administrators are concerned that students will snap up offers before they've had a chance to think through their career goals. "We worry that students are out there and don't know what they're doing yet," says Regina Regazzi,
executive director of corporate relations at University of California, Los Angeles's Anderson School of Management. Ms. Regazzi says her office is still working with recent graduates in the summer and can't devote time to preparing new students for corporate introductions. Ideally, she says, she would stage resume critiques and mock interviews first. In late July, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. hosts a two-day "early advantage program" for incoming minority, military and female students interested in investment banking. Deloitte Consulting LLP runs a three-day conference in July, which launched in 2010, where incoming first-year M.B.A.s may "have the opportunity to interview early for Summer Associates roles," according to the program's website. One of the biggest opportunities for early recruiting comes at a June event staged by the Consortium for Graduate Study in Management, a diversity network. About 400 students met in New Orleans this year to network with future classmates and interview with about 65 companies, including Eli Lilly

After starting conversations at Consortium, representatives from a few firms scheduled informal meetings late last month with students from Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management. Because the events were being held before the school's Sept. 9 start date for campus recruiting, recruiters called them "coffee chats" rather than actual interviews. Fred Staudmyer,
assistant dean and director of Johnson's career management center, declined to name the companies. Companies are also reluctant to talk about schools' recruiting policies. Representatives from J.P. Morgan, McKinsey & Co., Boston Consulting Group Inc. and Microsoft Corp.

declined to comment on how schools restrict their recruiting activities. Mr. Staudmyer says the early recruiting is good for students with clear career goals, as it can free them up to focus on personal development and their academic studies. But he worries that those without such certainty might accept job offers that aren't a good fit. The Stanford Graduate School of Business bars recruiters from campus for the first six weeks of the school year, in part to let first-year students concentrate on academics and reflect on their career plans without pressure to make any rash decisions. One downside of holding recruiters at bay until early November is that once the gate is lifted, students can be easily overwhelmed. Pulin Sanghvi,
assistant dean and director of the school's career management center, says there's a "mad rush" once recruiters get the all-clear. "We typically start engaging students proactively as soon as the schools allow us," since it takes time to build relationships with candidates, says Keith Bevans,
a partner and head of Bain & Co.'s Global Consultant Recruiting. Even though schools try to keep pace with recruiter demand, tensions do arise. Last year, representatives from an investment bank came to Ross for undergraduate and second-year M.B.A. recruiting, and expected first-year students to attend the same events—even though recruiting for that group didn't start for another few weeks. The Ross student finance club determined that first-year students could attend the presentations but wouldn't be penalized if they chose not to, says Tom Tait,
president of the group. (Recruiters often keep track of who attends the what activities to help gauge their interest in a company.) School administrators threaten to run interference with overly aggressive companies, but few have followed through. "They're not going to stop any company from engaging with the students," says Mr. Tait. "It's in their best interest to have us at as many companies as possible."

When Homes Become Hotels Short Stays, Lengthy Fights
Vacation Rentals Prompt Complaints and Bans, Spur Debate Over Property Rights When Homeowners Become Hoteliers, Some Neighbors Bristle at Noise, Nuisance
By
Conor Dougherty
Updated Nov. 23, 2012 8:24 p.m. ET
Renting a private home while on vacation, rather than paying for a hotel room, has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years, leading to a backlash from neighbors and prompting places from New York state to tiny Columbia Falls, Mont., to ban or restrict the practice. Now there is a backlash to the backlash—and a deep philosophical divide between property rights and neighbors' rights. On one side are homeowners who embrace the trend,...

The spread of technology from security cameras to smartphones in every pocket, has proved helpful to criminal investigations—including the one focused on this week's Boston Marathon explosions, Joel Schectman reports on digits.

As surveillance technology has spread from security cameras to smartphones in every pocket, it has sparked privacy concerns. At the same time, the technology has proved helpful to criminal investigations—including the one focused on this week's Boston Marathon explosions. On Wednesday, a government official said the Federal Bureau of Investigation used surveillance video from a Lord & Taylor department store and restaurants near the bomb site, as well as photographs from average citizens, news organizations and others to help identify a suspicious person at the marathon. That followed officials earlier in the week asking the public to share digital video and photos, which the FBI processed along with surveillance-camera footage from businesses near the finish line. Investigators planned to go through "every frame of every video," Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said.

Still, video and photo facial-recognition technologies remain in their infancy. From 2011 to 2016, the global market for video-surveillance technology is expected to nearly double to $20.5 billion, according to IHS IMS Research. According to Forrester Research, 68% of public-sector and 59% of private-sector companies have adopted video-surveillance technologies—and 9% plan to adopt it in the next two years. Moreover, more than a billion people now carry a basic tool of surveillance in their pockets: camera-equipped smartphones that connect to the Internet. Combining forensic image data from professional and personal sources has worked in previous cases. After the 2011 riots in Vancouver, British Columbia, authorities used nearly 1 million digital images and 1,600 hours of video gathered from the public and closed-circuit cameras to identify criminal acts and eventually bring charges against more than 200 people. Challenges remain to making use of all the new data. Facial recognition is often difficult to use in large-scale investigations because surveillance footage rarely has full-frontal images, which are needed for computers to identify enough key points on a face.

More interactive graphics and photos "It's not the way it is in the movies," said Aki Peritz, a former counterterrorism analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency, now senior policy adviser for national security at Third Way, a Washington think tank. "In real life you don't have someone looking directly into the camera, and the ability to make a match can be very much degraded if you don't have a full frontal." Then there is the challenge of collecting and sorting through the data. Boston has one of 77 nationwide intelligence "fusion centers" that is involved in helping investigators in this week's bombings to pool data and conduct analysis, said Mike Sena, director of the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center. The state-run centers were funded by the Department of Homeland Security after the Sept. 11 attacks to address the lack of interagency information sharing. The centers allow authorities to tap thousands of law-enforcement data sources, along with public data such as information from credit agencies, said Mr. Sena. But the system is still hampered by having data stored in separate systems that can't easily communicate. For example, classified reports from different federal agencies can't be accessed on the same machines, he said. Last year, the Senate subcommittee on investigations released a report questioning the effectiveness of the centers in fighting terrorism and protecting privacy. Explosions Rock Boston View Slideshow

Users of online discussion board 4chan sifted through photos and spotted a man seen at the marathon finish line wearing black pants, a black shirt and a white hat. That man appeared to bring a backpack to the race, but it seemed to be gone later. Researchers at Northeastern University in Boston formed a 10-person social-media research team to run a similar project, scheduled to launch Thursday, which would allow people to upload photos from the attack and tag clues. They said they plan to continue their project even if a suspect is found. Write to Geoffrey A. Fowler at geoffrey.fowler@wsj.com Email

Who's At Work?
By
Gene Epstein
August 31, 2013
The Labor Day holiday prompts an update on a key measure: the labor force participation rate. How large a share of the adult population is choosing to participate in the labor force, either by holding down a job or actively seeking one? And what factors, if any, might boost participation in the labor force, thereby providing a larger pool of available labor to produce things of value? The answer to either question is not encouraging. So far this year, the seven-month average on the participation rate has run 63.4%, a...
