“
I keep waiting for the Saturday Night Live sketch where a passenger stands up brandishing his cell phone and hijacks the flight. "I have a cell phone" he says "I am not afraid to use it." His finger hovers over the send key, ready to plunge the aircraft towards earth if his every demand is not satisfied.

There's%20No%20Need%20to%20End%20Saturday%20Mail%20Delivery
(1 day ago)
Comment: AlonzoI am a retired actuary who saw numerous organizations brought down by a refusal or inability to prefund their retiree medical obligations. Somehow, Senator Sanders has missed the examples, many of which got massive publicity in the financial press.Considering the falling demand for postal services and their employee demographics, the USPS is a prime candidate to join those examples if the prefunding is abandoned.The only point I can make in favor of Senator Sanders' position: 10 years may well have been to aggressive a time frame for prefunding, but that is not an argument for abandoning the prefunding completely, only an argument for giving the USPS an extended time frame. Driving an organization into bankruptcy in order to accelerate prefunding is not very productive.In an era when many state and local governments are threatened by their failure to prefund retiree health and pension obligations, it is gratifying to see the feds pushing for better funding in at least one area.Of course, the unfunded Social Security and Medicare obligations dwarf those of USPS, the states and the local governments combined.

Comment: For those who believe in the possibility of artificial intelligence, here is my rebuttal:Almost half a century ago, I knew Papert and Minsky when they were doing the early research on AI. They were constantly assuring us that it "is just around the corner, we are almost there". That was 45 years ago, and it is still just around the corner, but the corner seems further away.Today, my horse and my dog are both vastly more intelligent than my computer.I will place no bets in favor of AI. Suckers can take those bets.

Comment: No, No, you are all absolutely wrong. Here in the far northwest of the lower 48, I have been thinking it is time to plant spinach. In January. OK, my daughters are freezing on the other coast, but I am looking at an acre of green grass which should be covered by 3 feet of snow at this time of year. Forget about the freezing daughters, clearly this is global warming if I view the world from my private microscope. Leavenworth, Washington

Financial%20Scammers%20Increasingly%20Target%20Elderly%20Americans
(73 days ago)
Comment: Writing as one of those over 60, I do not feel that I have been singled out for fraud solicitations. My daughters seem to get plenty of them also. In fact, if you look at the USA population distribution, 24% of us are over age 60, excluding kids under 15. I assume the latter are rarely targets and if they are, the complaint will come from an adult parent. So we are 24% of the target population and generate 26% of the claims. Seems fairly closely in balance. If anything, I feel that my adult daughters are more likely to fall for a scam than I. Too trusting.

China is riding a wave of improving economic data, lifting expectations by some investment advisers that the world's second-largest economy is awakening from its recent slumber. In the third quarter, China-focused stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds gained an average of 11%, more than double the 5% return of a typical diversified emerging-market fund, according to investment researcher Morningstar. It was the group's first...

A U.S. Air Force B-2 stealth bomber flew near Osan U.S. Air Base, south of Seoul, on Thursday in a display of force aimed at deterring North Korean threats of attacks on the U.S. and South Korea.
Yonhap/Associated Press Two B-2 stealth bombers flew from a base in the American heartland, dropped test charges on targets near North Korea and returned to the U.S. on Thursday, as Washington mounted its most overt display of military force amid months of escalating tensions with North Korea. The B-2s, the most advanced heavy bombers in the U.S. arsenal, flew low over the South Korean city of Osan before dropping eight dummy munitions on a South Korean bombing range as part of annual joint exercises with South Korea's military. The dummies were inert versions of 2,000-pound bombs, one of the bigger conventional weapons in the U.S. arsenal. The B-2 can also carry nuclear payloads. The maneuvers illustrated the growing concern inside the Obama administration that North Korea and its 30-year-old leader, Kim Jong Eun,
may move beyond threats that have been commonplace against the U.S., South Korea and other allies in Asia. The fear is that Mr. Kim will continue with a string of military provocations that run the risk of sparking a major security crisis in Northeast Asia. Tensions Escalate North Korea Cuts Hotline North Korea said it was severing a military hot line with South Korea and showered invective on Seoul's new leader, even as Seoul pursued plans to improve relations with the North.
Signal Amid the Noise The hotine is used to coordinate traffic heading from the South into the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a few miles inside the North. So far, traffic heading from the South into the industrial zone has been unaffected.

North Korea says its rocket and artillery forces are on the 'highest alert' to strike the U.S. and other targets. The WSJ's Alastair Gale talks to Michael Arnold about the seriousness of Pyongyang's threats.
Read More Hopes Fade of Kim Rewriting North Korea's Script Executing a North Korean Coin Flip In North Korea, Mr. Kim ordered rockets to be on standby to strike U.S. bases in South Korea and the Pacific, as well as the U.S. mainland, state media reported. The order came after Mr. Kim and senior military officials held an emergency meeting in the early hours Friday, according North Korea's official KCNA agency. The B-2 flights were "an ultimatum that [the U.S.] will ignite a nuclear war at any cost on the Korean Peninsula," Mr. Kim said at the meeting. KCNA said the leader "said he has judged the time has come to settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists in view of the prevailing situation." U.S. officials said President Obama approved Thursday's deployment of the stealth bombers, which could be seen flying over the peninsula and whose mission was confirmed by U.S. military officials in the U.S. and South Korea. His decision, they said, came after their use was reviewed by top national security officials on a recommendation from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.
South Korean officials had asked for such a demonstration of U.S. "extended deterrence"—a military term used for nuclear force, defense officials said. The advanced bombers' training run from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri was the first such mission over South Korea to have been made public by the U.S. It was also the first time the craft have flown a round trip from U.S. to the Korean peninsula for such an exercise. It followed similar missions earlier this month by B-52 bombers during the annual U.S.-South Korean war games. The flights were aimed at establishing clear military limits for Mr. Kim and his generals, senior U.S. officials said, at a time when they have shown an increasing willingness to challenge American military power in Asia. The Pentagon struggled over the decision to deploy the bombers as part of the war games, called Foal Eagle, according to U.S. officials. Some U.S. officials argued that the bomber flights would be unduly provocative and akin to recent North Korean actions, which these officials said have irresponsibly ratcheted up tensions. Defense officials acknowledged that North Korean military officers are particularly agitated by bomber flights because of memories of the destruction wrought from the air during the Korean War. Other administration officials argued in favor of a strong show of force, according to senior defense officials. The U.S. defense secretary said he believed the bomber flights would calm the situation. "I don't think we're poking back or responding," Mr. Hagel said. "The North Koreans have to understand that what they're doing is very dangerous." North Korea's provocations in Asia have emerged as another national security challenge for the Obama administration, which is seeking to end the war in Afghanistan, contemplating military action to end sectarian strife in Syria, and seeking to devise strategies to contain Iran's growing nuclear capabilities. U.S. officials acknowledge that North Korea's nuclear program is now far more advanced than Tehran's. Mr. Obama took office in 2009 pledging to engage diplomatically with Washington's international antagonists, including the governments in Iran, Syria and North Korea. But the White House was stung by Pyongyang, which has snubbed its overtures. The Obama administration is particularly uncertain about how to respond to Mr. Kim, who took power from his late father, Kim Jong Il, only 16 months ago, according to administration officials. The White House initially hoped that the younger Kim, who studied at a boarding school in Switzerland, would prove more willing to engage the West and promote economic and political reforms in his country. In recent months, senior executives from Google Inc.

and the former American basketball star, Dennis Rodman,
have visited Pyongyang. U.S. defense officials and Asia experts, however, now believe that Mr. Kim, in an effort to consolidate his power in the North, is proving more willing to pursue military adventurism than his father. They said they believed that many of Pyongyang's recent actions were aimed at North Korea's domestic audience and to show Mr. Kim as a strong leader willing to confront his country's historic enemy. Last year, the State Department announced an agreement with Pyongyang for the delivery of food aid to North Korea in exchange for steps to contain its nuclear program. But just days after the proposed deal, the North announced and eventually executed a long-range missile test. Pyongyang argued it had launched a satellite as part of its civilian space program.

South Korean soldiers stand guard at the border with North Korea.
Zuma Press Obama administration officials have said they have no current intention of reengaging with the North. Instead, the White House has pursued a policy of heightened economic sanctions against the communist country, both unilaterally and through the United Nations; new efforts to develop missile defense in Asia; and new measures to develop join-military capabilities with South Korea and Japan. Long-time North Korea experts said they believed Mr. Kim might ratchet down his rhetoric in the coming weeks to avoid a direct confrontation with Washington. They also pointed out that rhetoric out of North Korea is often heightened around this time of year—when North Korea holds its annual legislative session and the South and U.S. hold military exercises—but often settles down later. But they said they also feared that the U.S. and North Korea are now on a course with no clear path toward de-escalation. "We are in a vicious cycle," said Evans Revere, a former senior State Department official who now works on Asia issues at the Brookings Institution. "Even if things calm down after the current U.S.-South Korea exercise, we will still be at a higher level of tension than in the past." The B-2s, escorted by two F-15s, dropped their dummy munitions at the bombing range on the South Korean island of Jik Do in daylight. U.S. officials said they didn't believe North Korea could detect the approach of the B-2s but couldn't be certain. They noted that once the bombers passed over the Korean peninsula, they were no longer trying to hide their presence. "We could fly it at night, but the point was for them to see it," said a U.S. defense official. The flight was timed, in part, to the anniversary of the 2010 sinking of a South Korean naval vessel, the Cheonan, which resulted in the death of 46 South Korean sailors. North Korea has denied it attacked the ship. Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said the North Koreans appear to have moved naval ships on both coasts as well as artillery on the other side of the Demilitarized Zone north of Seoul. But he said those movements were likely part of normal North Korean military exercises. "There have been movements. We haven't seen anything that would cause us to believe they are movements other than consistent with historic patterns and training exercises," Gen. Dempsey said.

At the Bear Creek Studio outside Seattle, music producer Ryan Hadlock huddled in the control room with members of a folk-rock band listening to the recorded sounds of pounding feet. They had stomped on surfaces all around the facility, but the most resonant booms were captured from a wooden step with a hollow space below. The recording they chose formed the signature beat of the song "Ho Hey," which went on to become a surprise hit for the Lumineers. The stomping, like the rest of the music the Lumineers made...
