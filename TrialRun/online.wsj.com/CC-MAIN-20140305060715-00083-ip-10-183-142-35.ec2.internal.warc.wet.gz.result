Associated Press
NEW YORK — Completion of the long-awaited project to link the Long Island Rail Road into Grand Central Terminal may now be 2023 and cost $10.7 billion.
The new estimates were presented to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Monday.
In 2006, the agency estimated the East Side Access project could be finished by the end of 2013 at a cost of $6.3 billon.
The MTA now predicts the project could be finished in 2020 or 2021 for $9.7 billion.
But forecasts by independent consultants suggest completion between 2021 and 2023. The Federal Transit Administration cost estimate is $10.7 billion.
The new East River tunnel will allow LIRR trains access to Grand Central Terminal. All LIRR trains now go to Penn Station on Manhattan's west side.

Los ahorradores, el nuevo dolor de cabeza de la banca española
Artículo

Por CHRISTOPHER BJORK
MOAÑA, España—Una mañana de agosto, Eugenio Núñez Cobás irrumpió en una sucursal de un banco en esta ciudad costera con otros 30 clientes gritando "¡Ladrones! ¡Ladrones! ¡Ladrones!" A continuación, salieron a la calle y tiraron huevos contra la fachada, obligando a la sucursal a cerrar por el resto del día.
Núñez ha estado viniendo a la filial de Novagalicia Banco SA durante los últimos ocho meses con una pancarta que dice: "Tengo todos mis ahorros metidos en Caja Novagalicia Banco hasta 2999". El jubilado de 70 años afirma que "en realidad, tendría que estar en casa jugando con mis nietos. En cambio, estoy aquí todas las semanas, peleando por mis ahorros".
Núñez fue uno de los más de 700.000 depositantes españoles que invirtieron dinero —en algunos casos la totalidad de sus ahorros— en acciones preferentes de alto rendimiento y bonos subordinados emitidos por sus bancos. Cuando estalló la crisis económica, los valores se desplomaron, lo que hizo que se volvieran casi imposibles de revender.

Christopher Bjork/The Wall Street Journal
Una reciente manifestación contra los bancos en Baiona, España.
Muchos clientes ahora dicen que fueron estafados, que los bancos les garantizaron que estos complejos instrumentos financieros eran tan seguros como los depósitos. Algunas entidades ofrecían la opción de cambiar acciones preferentes por depósitos o bonos comunes, pero la Unión Europea, que está prestando dinero a España para apuntalar la banca, prohibió que los bancos rescatados por el gobierno, entre los que figura Novagalicia, realicen estos acuerdos. Novagalicia se disculpó públicamente y accedió a arbitrar los miles de reclamos de los afectados.
El ministro de Economía, Luis de Guindos, describió recientemente estos valores ante el Parlamento como "un complejo instrumento para inversores institucionales. El problema no es el instrumento en sí. Si la gente lo entiende, no hay problema. El problema es que se colocó entre gente que no entendió estos productos". El gobierno español, añadió, colabora con la UE "para intentar encontrar la mejor solución posible para estos ahorradores".
Esta embarazosa confrontación entre bancos y depositantes contribuye a la erosión de la confianza en un sistema financiero que ya sufre el impacto de las fugas de capital y enormes pérdidas ligadas al colapso del mercado inmobiliario. El sector financiero se ha vuelto cada vez más dependiente de los préstamos de emergencia del Banco Central Europeo. Hasta fines de agosto, los bancos españoles recibieron 412.600 millones de euros (US$538.000 millones) del BCE, en torno a un tercio de los fondos del banco central para prestamistas de la zona euro. "Mientras persista la desconfianza en el sistema bancario, seguirá habiendo fuga de capitales", dijo Domingo Bello, profesor de derecho de la Universidad de La Coruña.
Misiones de sabotaje como la que protagonizó Núñez en Moaña ocurren prácticamente a diario. Una noche del mes pasado, los manifestantes en la región norteña de Cantabria organizaron ataques coordinados en 50 sucursales de Caja Cantabria. En Cataluña, decenas de clientes enojados han obstruido a los cajeros haciendo depósitos de 50 centavos para luego volver a colocarse en la cola y retirar la misma cantidad.
En algunas comunidades pequeñas, los directores de las sucursales bancarias, que en su día ejercían como fuentes de asesoría financiera, se han convertido en parias. Los clientes han amenazado con propinar palizas a empleados bancarios y han rajado los neumáticos de sus autos. Novagalicia ha trasladado a 25 de sus empleados este año por las amenazas, asegura un vocero.
En Moaña, una ciudad pesquera de 18.000 habitantes en el noroeste de España, las pérdidas provocadas por las inversiones han agravado los problemas económicos. "La pequeña empresa sufre y esos pequeños trabajos de mantenimiento que la gente hacía en sus casas, ya no los hacen", dijo el alcalde José Fervenza Costas.
La debacle de las acciones preferentes se remonta a los primeros días de la crisis financiera. Los bancos españoles necesitaban capital tras el estallido de la burbuja inmobiliaria y el aumento de la cartera incobrable. Los inversionistas internacionales, preocupados por las pérdidas ligadas a las hipotecas, se mostraron reacios a comprar valores bancarios españoles. Por eso, las mayores entidades del país recurrieron a su amplia red de sucursales para promocionar las nuevas acciones preferentes.
Las acciones preferentes a menudo prometían tasas de interés más altas que los depósitos comunes y corrientes. A mediados de 2009, Caixa Galicia —que luego fue absorbida por Novagalicia— ofrecía acciones preferentes con un interés de 7,5%, comparado con el 4,05% de los depósitos a 18 meses.
Los bancos rápidamente aumentaron sus niveles de capital, vendiendo 11.400 millones de euros en acciones preferentes en 2009. En total, se vendieron 22.000 millones de euros de esos valores.
"Si un cliente quería vender, cinco más esperaban para comprar", señala Pedro Alberto San Millán, director de una sucursal de Novagalicia en el pueblo de Cangas.
Pero en 2010, cuando los bancos españoles empezaron a inundarse de pérdidas, el número de clientes dispuestos a comprar acciones preferentes se redujo. Algunas entidades, incluida Novagalicia, vendieron los valores a clientes de larga data. "Los reguladores miraban hacia otro lado y los bancos se aprovecharon", dice Francisco López Lubián, un profesor de finanzas de la escuela de negocios Instituto de Empresa. "El español medio que confió sus ahorros a su banquero, fue engañado. Eso está claro", añade.
El regulador español de valores anunció hace unos meses que investiga irregularidades potenciales en 11 de los 19 prestamistas que vendieron acciones preferentes. La nueva cúpula ejecutiva de Novagalicia emitió en julio una guía de 10 principios, uno de los cuales estipula que el banco sólo ofrecerá productos claros, sencillos y fáciles de entender. En Moaña, Núñez ganó el 21 de septiembre su caso de arbitraje contra Novagalicia. Su cuenta de ahorros ha sido reembolsada con los 60.000 euros que tenía colocados en bonos subordinados. El dinero no estará ahí mucho tiempo, insiste Núñez. "Lo voy a sacar", promete. "Me dijeron que habían cambiado, pero después de esto, ya no me puedo fiar de ellos".

Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week could be burdened by a decidedly inelegant accessory during its inaugural run at Lincoln Center: a picket line. In the run-up to New York Fashion Week's Sept. 9 opening, a dispute is brewing between IMG Fashion, which produces the biannual event; Local One of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the union that oversees much of the stagehand and other theatrical labor used at the performing-arts complex; and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. Enlarge Image
The tents at Bryant Park are reflected in a window on the final day of New York Fashion Week in February.
Reuters With preliminary set-up for the fashion event scheduled to begin this weekend, the union will hold an emergency board meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss its options. The disagreement is rooted in the nature of the union's relationship with Lincoln Center and the specific location where IMG is scheduled to erect the tents it will use for fashion shows. The contract between the union and the performing-arts complex gives the union jurisdiction over many events on the Lincoln Center campus, including those held in venues like Alice Tully Hall.
But it does not require the use of union labor for events that take place on the plaza or surrounding areas, such as Damrosch Park, in the southwest corner of the plaza, where Fashion Week will pitch its tents. But according to President James J. Claffey, Jr.,
the union is traditionally awarded contracts for such events, including the annual Christmas tree-lighting ceremony that takes place near the center's fountain and the seasonal dance event Midsummer Night Swing. And based on that precedent, Mr. Claffey believes IMG should be required to hire union labor for all Fashion Week events held at Lincoln Center. "Local One is the labor provider. We have a relationship to the entire campus," Mr. Claffey said. "It's absolute practice." A spokesman for IMG, Zach Eichman, said via email the company is working to avoid an escalation of the disagreement. "The various issues that exist now we are sure will find an amicable solution by September 9," Mr. Eichman said. "As we move into final preparations, our team is focused on providing the most cost efficient, effective, and user-friendly productions for our designer and sponsor clients and as such, will work diligently to make the move to Lincoln Center as smooth as possible." A spokeswoman for Lincoln Center said that because Fashion Week is a renter, rather than a resident organization, the center does not dictate the terms of the event's labor arrangements. "Lincoln Center has enjoyed amicable and productive relationships with Local One for many years," spokeswoman Betsy Vorce
said. "Mercedes Benz Fashion Week at Lincoln Center will operate in Damrosch Park with IMG as its licensee." Enlarge Image
Fashion designers and industry notables pose with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to promote Fashion's Night Out at City Hall in New York. Visible, from left, are Jack McCollough, Linda Fargo, Francisco Costa, Tory Burch, Stephen Sadove, Tracy Reese, Anna Wintour, Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs, Carolina Herrera, Steven Kolb, Vera Wang, Zac Posen and Lazaro Hernandez.
Associated Press Both Lincoln Center and the parks department have told IMG that the union has no jurisdiction over the park property, according to a person familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman for the parks department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "Things are very sensitive now," Mr. Claffey said. "We're going to exercise our legal rights if they don't come to some sort of agreement with us." The union will consider pamphleting or setting up a picket line, according to a person familiar with the matter. Certain events occurring under the umbrella of New York Fashion Week will take place in Lincoln Center facilities that require the use of union labor, and those events will comply with the lease terms of those facilities, according to a person familiar with the matter. The outcome of the current dispute will have an impact not only on this season's shows but will also set a precedent for the future relationship between the two groups. IMG has a five-year contract to host Fashion Week at Lincoln Center, and it is expected to make use in coming years of an increasing number of facilities throughout the Lincoln Center campus. Prior to this season, New York Fashion Week was held in Bryant Park. Write to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.com Email

Updated Feb. 19, 2011 12:01 a.m. ET
This week President Obama was roundly criticized, even by many of his allies, for submitting a federal budget that actually increases our already crushing deficit. But that didn't stop him Thursday from jumping into Wisconsin's titanic budget battle. He accused the new Republican governor, Scott Walker, of launching an "assault" on unions with his emergency legislation aimed at cutting the state budget. The real assault this week was led by Organizing for America, the successor to President's Obama's 2008 campaign organization. It helped fill buses of protesters who flooded the state capital of Madison and ran 15 phone banks urging people to call state legislators. Mr. Walker's proposals are hardly revolutionary. Facing a $137 million budget deficit, he has decided to try to avoid laying off 5,500 state workers by proposing that they contribute 5.8% of their income towards their pensions and 12.6% towards health insurance. That's roughly the national average for public pension payments, and it is less than half the national average of what government workers contribute to health care. Mr. Walker also wants to limit the power of public-employee unions to negotiate contracts and work rules—something that 24 states already limit or ban. OpinionJournal.com columnist John Fund on the politics of the Madison protests. Also, features editor Robert Pollock explains which occupations are going away.
The governor's move is in reaction to a 2009 law implemented by the then-Democratic legislature that expanded public unions' collective-bargaining rights and lifted existing limits on teacher raises. Democratic reactions to these proposals have been over the top. In addition to the thousands of protesters who descended on the Capitol building on Thursday to intimidate legislators, so many teachers called in sick on Friday that school districts in Milwaukee, Madison and Janesville had to close. Then there's the rhetoric. "This is about the clean government Wisconsin has enjoyed over the past century versus the corrupt government that Scott Walker proposes," thundered the liberal Madison Capital Times newspaper earlier this week. Democratic State Sen. Bob Jauch called Mr. Walker's move "the end of the democratic process" during the committee debate on Wednesday night. But when it became obvious that the governor had the votes to pass it, Mr. Jauch and his 13 Democratic colleagues got on a bus and fled the state to deprive Republicans of a sufficient quorum to conduct any legislative business. They were later found at a Best Western Hotel in Rockford, Ill. Scot Ross, director of the liberal activist group One Wisconsin Now, endorsed the temper tantrum: "The senators have rightfully taken matters into their own hands." Why are national liberal groups treating Wisconsin as if it were their last stand? Partly for reasons of symbolism. Historically, Wisconsin "embraced the organized labor movement more heartily than any other [state]," notes liberal activist Abe Sauer. The Badger State became the first to pass a worker-compensation program in 1911, as well as the first to create unemployment compensation in 1932. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees—the chief national union representing non-federal public employees—was founded in Madison in 1936. And in 1959, Wisconsin became the first state to grant public employees collective-bargaining rights, which influenced President John F. Kennedy's decision to grant federal employees the right to join unions three years later. Labor historian Fred Siegel offers further reasons why unions are manning the barricades. Mr. Walker would require that public-employee unions be recertified annually by a majority vote of all their members, not merely by a majority of those that choose to cast ballots. In addition, he would end the government's practice of automatically deducting union dues from employee paychecks. For Wisconsin teachers, union dues total between $700 and $1,000 a year.

Getty Images Slideshow: Teachers Revolt Public employee protests spread across the Midwest. "Ending dues deductions breaks the political cycle in which government collects dues, gives them to the unions, who then use the dues to back their favorite candidates and also lobby for bigger government and more pay and benefits," Mr. Siegel told me. After New York City's Transport Workers Union lost the right to automatic dues collection in 2007 following an illegal strike, its income fell by more than 35% as many members stopped ponying up. New York City ended the dues collection ban after 18 months. Myron Lieberman, a former Minnesota public school teacher who became a contract negotiator for the American Federation of Teachers, says that since the 1960s collective bargaining has so "greatly increased the political influence of unions" that they block the sorts of necessary change that other elements of society have had to accept. The labor laws that Wisconsin unions are so bitterly defending were popular during an era of industrialization and centralization. But the labor organizations they protect have become much less popular, as the declining membership of many private-sector unions attests. Moreover, it's become abundantly clear that too many government workers enjoy wages, benefits and pensions that are out of line with the rest of the economy. Mr. Walker's argument—that public workers shouldn't be living high off the hog at the expense of taxpayers—is being made in other states facing budget crises. But the left observed the impact of the tea party last year and seems determined to unleash a more aggressive version of its own by teaming up with union allies. Organizing for America is already coordinating protests against proposed reforms in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri. Mr. Fund is a columnist for WSJ.com. Email
