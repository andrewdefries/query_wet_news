Want to see where your food might come from in the future? Look up. Journal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/EnergyReport More in ECO:nomics Green Investing: So Much Promise, So Little Return How Natural Gas Is Changing Everything Toward Common Ground on Energy Building a Green City The seeds of an agricultural revolution are taking root in cities around the world—a movement that boosters say will change the way that urbanites get their produce and solve some of the world's biggest environmental problems along the way. It's called vertical farming, and it's based on one simple principle: Instead of trucking food from farms into cities, grow it as close to home as possible—in urban greenhouses that stretch upward instead of sprawling outward. Vote
The idea is flowering in many forms. There's the 12-story triangular building going up in Sweden, where plants will travel on tracks from the top floor to the bottom to take advantage of sunlight and make harvesting easier. Then there's the onetime meatpacking plant in Chicago where vegetables are grown on floating rafts, nourished by waste from nearby fish tanks. And the farms dotted across the U.S. that hang their crops in the air, spraying the roots with nutrients, so they don't have to bring in soil or water tanks for the plants. However vertical farming is implemented, advocates say the immediate benefits will be easy to see. There won't be as many delivery trucks guzzling fuel and belching out exhaust, and city dwellers will get easier access to fresh, healthy food. Enlarge Image
Plantagon Looking further, proponents say vertical farming could bring even bigger and more sweeping changes. Farming indoors could reduce the use of pesticides and herbicides, which pollute the environment in agricultural runoff. Preserving or reclaiming more natural ecosystems like forests could help slow climate change. And the more food we produce indoors, the less susceptible we are to environmental crises that disrupt crops and send prices skyrocketing, like the drought that devastated this year's U.S. corn crop. Dickson Despommier, a microbiology professor at Columbia University who developed the idea of vertical farming with students in 1999, thinks vertical farming will become more and more attractive as climate change drives up the cost of conventional farming and technological advances make greenhouse farming cheaper. In fact, he hopes the world will be able to produce half of its food in vertical farms in 50 years. Then "a significant portion of farmland could be abandoned," he says. "Ecosystem functions would rapidly improve, and the rate of global warming would slow down." An Idea on the Rise A host of vertical farms are up and running in the U.S. and overseas, and others are under construction. Some are backed by nonprofits aiming to promote environmental causes or local job creation. Others will be for-profit ventures meant to meet demand for local produce. And some, like one in South Korea, are being funded by governments looking for ways to boost domestic food security. View Graphics
So far, vertical farms are producing only a small amount of food. Advocates are still developing different building designs and growing techniques to boost the efficiency of cultivating food indoors. And a proven business model based on the concept has yet to emerge. One ambitious project under construction is trying to address all of those challenges at once. At 12 stories, the triangular farm in Linköping, Sweden, will be one of the tallest vertical farms in the world—most max out at several stories—and will use innovative ways to generate revenue. Not only will the company behind the farm, Sweden's Plantagon, sell its produce at a local farmer's market, but it also will lease out office space on most floors. Another unique feature: Outside the office windows, on the building's southern face, a mechanical track enclosed in its own layer of glass will carry growing plants from the top of the building to the bottom floor. The arrangement is meant to give the plants even exposure to sunlight and allow Plantagon to perform all of its planting and harvesting in one place—on the ground floor. (After planting, a normal vertical elevator takes the boxed plants to the top floor to start their voyage down.) The company plans to produce 300 to 500 metric tons of leafy greens like bok choy a year. Offsetting Costs As for the price tag, "it's much more expensive, of course, to build a greenhouse vertical than to build a normal greenhouse," says Hans Hassle, Plantagon's chief executive. But the planned revenue streams will help make up for that, and energy costs will be lower because the setup will use waste from various sources—such as heat from a nearby power plant and biogas produced through conversion of the building's own organic garbage. All told, the planned energy-saving measures will reduce the building's energy use by at least 30% to 50%, Mr. Hassle says. Mr. Hassle says the company's next greenhouse will be either a demonstration model in Shanghai or a research facility in Singapore. These are good venues for the idea, he says, because they're highly dense and urbanized societies that already need to produce more food locally. In the U.S., vertical farms are sprouting in urban areas across the country, some in old buildings that have been repurposed for agriculture. One operation called the Plant is producing vegetables in a three-story former meatpacking facility on Chicago's South Side. The farm grows vegetables on small rafts floating on water, which is filled with nutrients from waste produced by fish in a separate tank—a setup called aquaponics. Light comes from lamps designed to emit the proper wavelengths for plant growth. The Plant is also designing a growing system in which crops could grow sticking out at an upward angle from vertical boards, with nutrients provided to the plant roots by water dripping down a film from pipes near the ceiling. The Plant was founded by John Edel, a 43-year-old Chicago native who has led other projects to renovate and reuse urban buildings. The facility currently rents out parts of its space to tenants including three farmers and two bakeries and plans to find more; it also intends to open a shared retail area where the tenants can sell their goods.

GROW ANYWHERE This AeroFarms system is being used in buildings in Seattle, Chicago and elsewhere.
AeroFarms Other farms around the country use different techniques designed to save space, reduce water consumption and even avoid the need for soil. Farms in warehouses and other buildings in Seattle, Chicago, upstate New York and New Jersey, among other places, use an aeroponics system from AeroFarms of Ithaca, N.Y. The method involves growing plants with their roots hanging in the air, where they can be sprayed with water and nutrients. Omega Garden Inc., of Qualicum Beach, British Columbia, sells a planting device called Volksgarden, a rotating cylinder four feet in diameter and two feet long. Plants grow in a circle around the inside of the cylinder. As the device rotates, their roots dip into a tray holding a liquid solution that provides water and nutrients. A light runs horizontally through the cylinder to nourish the crops. Green Spirit Farms LLC is using the system in New Buffalo, Mich., in a former plastics-injection facility. The farm plans to fill the space with Volksgarden units stacked three levels high, says Green Spirit site manager Ben Wiggins. Simpler Solutions? Still, many agricultural experts aren't sold on the idea of vertical farming. The core argument against it: Conventional farms are the simplest and most efficient places to produce food. Growing food indoors, using artificial lights and other special equipment, means more effort and expense—and cancels out any benefits of being close to customers, critics say. That's why George Monbiot, a writer and environmental activist based in Oxford, England, says there's "no prospect" that more complicated vertical-farming techniques could contribute substantially to world food production. As for those vertical farming systems that will consume extra energy to power equipment like artificial lights, he says, "Even if you are taking the energy from renewable sources, there are better ways of using that renewable energy." Likewise, R. Ford Denison, an adjunct professor of agricultural ecology at the University of Minnesota, thinks the energy use from vertical farms would cancel out any fuel savings from transportation. "Food transport from farm to store is a tiny fraction of total agricultural energy use," he says. So if vertical farms use even small amounts of energy to run their systems, or if consumers have to use extra fuel traveling to urban farmers' markets, it "would swamp any energy savings in transporting food to the cities." Backers say the comparison between conventional and vertical farming isn't apples to apples, since the government heavily subsidizes expenses including crop insurance for traditional agriculture, greatly reducing the costs involved and the risks that farmers face from unpredictable weather conditions. Food Security But boosters say the equation will very likely change as severe weather makes indoor farming a safer and more reliable alternative to regular growing. Not only will the rising cost of conventional farming make vertical farms look better in comparison, they say, but vertical farms in some places could end up getting subsidies. "If we imagine that vertical farming is going to become part of a nation's food-security program, then naturally this part of the industry needs subsidies," Plantagon's Mr. Hassle says. Dr. Despommier, who is also an adviser to Plantagon, acknowledges that energy use, particularly in artificial lighting, remains a challenge for some vertical farms. But he says the lighting industry has made significant progress in recent years on reducing power consumption for specialized lights to grow plants, and researchers continue to work on the problem. More broadly, he argues that the idea of vertical farming on a large scale will seem increasingly realistic as techniques evolve. He cites cellphones and plasma-screen televisions as examples of innovations that were unimaginable before their time. "You have to start small and you have to start at the research level before you jump into the commercial aspect of this thing, but that's the way all these ideas start," Dr. Despommier says. "Everything we have in this world of ours started out crazy." The Readers Weigh In Most WSJ.com readers in an online poll have expressed interest in buying local food. Here's a sampling of comments. I can see how things are grown and made and how the animals are treated. Being knowledgeable about the food you eat is extremely important. Ignorance is no longer bliss when it comes to what goes into your food. -- Scargosun The locavore movement isn't just about getting food that is fresher, but also about supporting the local economy. It is "worth it" to keep our dollars and jobs within our community. -- Carolyn Pearce The long-term benefits for our environment, local economies and health far outweigh the expense and inconvenience. If more people start buying local then the cost will decline. -- Ben Schaub Mr. Fletcher is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Chicago bureau. He can be reached at owen.fletcher@wsj.com.

David Stevens
bought his first home almost 25 years ago, paying just 3% down with a loan backed by the Federal Housing Administration. "I had no money in the bank," he says. "If it weren't for the FHA, I wouldn't have gotten that home." Now, as FHA commissioner, Mr. Stevens has to decide how many others to let through that door. Souring FHA-insured mortgages are threatening the agency's finances. Congress is pressuring him to tighten the easy-money standards that once helped people like him, and he is expected to announce revisions as early as this week. FHA chief David Stevens is likely to announce tightened credit standards as early as this week.
Bloomberg News But raising the credit bar could have a dangerous side effect. In many of the nation's hardest-hit housing markets, the FHA backs around half of all new home loans. If the agency pulls back too quickly, the nascent housing recovery could fizzle, endangering the economy. The dilemma puts the 52-year-old former mortgage banker squarely in the middle of the debate over how much the government should do to prop up the housing market, and how much risk taxpayers should take on to do it. "How big a role do we need to play to keep the housing system functioning?" says Mr. Stevens, referring to the FHA. "Overcorrecting in either direction would be a terrible thing to do right now." Developments Blog Are 3.5% down payments too low? Join the discussion Journal Community Vote: What size downpayment should be required for an FHA mortgage? Mr. Stevens is finalizing possible revisions to credit standards. Options include raising the minimum down payment, establishing a minimum credit score, increasing the amount that borrowers have to pay for mortgage insurance, and reducing the amount of money sellers can kick in for closing costs. The FHA, created in 1934 to heal the U.S. housing market during the Great Depression, traditionally has helped first-time home buyers and underserved segments of the market. It doesn't lend money to home buyers, but insures lenders against default on loans that meet FHA criteria, collecting fees for that backing. For decades, thanks to a stable housing market, it turned a profit for taxpayers. When the housing market was booming, subprime lenders drew away many of the borrowers who traditionally used FHA-backed loans by offering even more favorable terms. Unlike the FHA, subprime lenders didn't require borrowers to document their incomes. The FHA saw its share of the mortgage market fall to 2% in 2006. But when the subprime market collapsed, mortgage brokers began steering borrowers into FHA-backed loans. Politicians and policy makers encouraged the FHA to refinance at-risk borrowers into fixed-rate loans. Suddenly, the FHA had an enormous chunk of the market. Average credit scores of FHA borrowers dropped sharply at first. In last year's third quarter, the FHA insured 25% of mortgages, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. "We should not play this large a role," Mr. Stevens says. "It's not healthy for the mortgage-finance system, it's not healthy for the economy, and it's certainly not sustainable for the long term." The FHA, which is part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, isn't as nimble as private mortgage insurers. It must get approval from Congress for some major decisions. "They don't have the horsepower that they should, especially given the size of their operations," says Ann Schnare, a mortgage-industry consultant. In testimony before Congress last month, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan
acknowledged that the FHA "we inherited" was "not properly managing or monitoring its risk. Credit and risk controls were antiquated. Enforcement was weak. And our personnel resources and IT systems were inadequate." Mr. Stevens knows the industry well. He is the first FHA commissioner in nearly two decades to bring extensive private-sector experience to the job. During the 1980s, he was a top salesman of complex adjustable-rate mortgages for World Savings Bank, a California thrift. He went on to hold senior jobs at housing-finance giant Freddie Mac
and at Wells Fargo & Co. In his off time, he plays guitar, rides his BMW motorcycle and skis the backcountry. On the job, he gets his way through sheer "force of personality," says Eugene McQuade, once Mr. Stevens's boss when they worked at Freddie and now chief executive of Citigroup Inc.

's Citibank unit. When Mr. Stevens arrived in July 2009, the FHA didn't have anyone in charge of monitoring risk, including whether certain loan products or lenders were exposing the agency to excessive losses. In his second week on the job, Mr. Stevens suspended the FHA license for Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage Corp., one of the nation's top lenders, amid concerns that the company was originating too many bad loans. Taylor Bean closed its doors the next day. In November, he hired the agency's first chief risk officer and five Ph.D. economists to help evaluate risk. That same month, FHA cut off Lend America, another major lender, which also closed. But there are still signs of trouble. At about 30 FHA-approved lenders with at least 1,000 loan originations, more than 12% of loans are in default two years after origination, nearly double the national average at the end of November. Last Tuesday, HUD's inspector general served subpoenas on 15 of those lenders as part of an examination of the practices of lenders with high default rates. The percentage of FHA-backed loans that defaulted after borrowers made just one payment—typically an indication of poor underwriting or fraud—has started to fall, but not as fast as needed to avoid future loan losses. FHA-insured mortgages made in 2007 and 2008 are largely responsible for the agency's precarious position, with default rates approaching 24%. FHA officials concede that the agency offers today's easiest underwriting standards. Twenty percent down ought to be the minimun to get FHA to hold a loan. Little or nothing down encourages speculation, walk away buyers, and drives up prices to unsustainable levels, while the taxpayer and more prudent citizen pays the price. —Khan Singh
Mr. Stevens, nevertheless, lashes out at critics who say the FHA is repeating the mistakes of subprime lenders. At a conference in November, Robert Toll,
chief executive of luxury-home builder Toll Brothers Inc., referred to the FHA as "the new subprime" and "a definite train wreck" that will soon need a bailout, according to a transcript of his remarks. Mr. Stevens, in an interview, called the comparison "ludicrous," and said Mr. Toll has "no clue" about the agency's finances. The agency is required by Congress to hold enough capital in reserve to cover 30 years of projected losses. An independent audit said reserves at the end of September exceeded projected losses by just $3.6 billion, about 0.5% of the $685 billion in loans outstanding, down from 3% a year earlier. Congress requires the agency to maintain a 2% capital-reserve ratio. FHA officials say they have enough cash to cover the current level of losses, and that the agency risks running out of money only if home prices take another big dive. "We've learned from recent history that the market is fragile, and we have to plan for the unexpected," Mr. Donovan, the HUD secretary, said last month. But some analysts say the agency's assumptions about home prices and foreclosures are too optimistic. "FHA is, at best, running on empty, and probably is facing a negative capital situation," Ms. Schnare, the industry consultant, told a congressional panel last month. If the agency were to run short of cash to cover projected losses, it likely would have to ask Congress for money for the first time ever. The bad-loan problem stems, in part, from controversial programs that allowed home builders and other sellers to fund down payments for home buyers through nonprofit groups. After a lengthy effort, the FHA prevailed on Congress to shut the programs down in October 2008, but the damage already was done. The FHA's independent audit concluded that were it not for such programs, the agency's capital-reserve ratio would have stayed above the 2% mandated by law. In another troubling practice, by late 2007, institutional investors were identifying at-risk mortgages in their portfolios and refinancing the borrowers into FHA-backed loans, thereby offloading their risk onto the agency. "It was an unintentional bailout of financial institutions," says David Lykken, a partner at Mortgage Banking Solutions, an Austin, Texas, consulting firm. One of the raft of measures Mr. Stevens is considering to protect and replenish the agency's reserves is raising the minimum down payment. The current minimum of 3.5% is far lower than what private lenders offer, making FHA-backed loans one of the last low-down-payment options left. Last year, through August, nearly seven in eight new FHA-backed loans carried down payments of less than 5%. Home builders are worried. "It would be a game changer for the industry" if down payments were raised, says Eric Lipar, chief executive of LGI Homes, a Texas-based builder of entry-level homes. Not everyone believes that such low down payments are good. In markets where home values are still falling, buyers who put little money down could see their equity wiped out quickly. The FHA is "just manufacturing more upside-down homeowners by the truckload in Arizona, California, and Nevada," says Brett Barry, a Phoenix real-estate agent who specializes in selling foreclosed homes. If the agency were to raise down payments sharply in those markets, price declines would become a "self-fulfilling prophecy," says Mr. Stevens. "If you stop lending, you're going to perpetuate the declines." Mr. Stevens says first-time buyers are key to clearing inventory in markets such as Las Vegas. James Smith, a 42-year-old air-conditioning repairman, might not have been able to buy a $188,000 home out of foreclosure recently in Henderson, Nev., were it not for the low FHA down payments. To make the 3.5% payment, he used around $4,300 of his own money and borrowed the rest from this father-in-law. "It was actually a great thing," he says. He repaid his father-in-law after receiving an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers. Mr. Smith, who earns around $50,000 annually, makes monthly payments of $1,466. Mr. Stevens says he expects to get heat from industry and consumer groups no matter what he decides to do to tighten credit standards. Even as the FHA considers how to scale back, some members of Congress are pushing it to expand its role. In 2008, in the midst of the credit crisis, Congress temporarily raised the maximum FHA loan from $362,790 to as high as $729,750 for the most expensive housing markets. Lawmakers have introduced a bill to make that increase permanent. "A $500,000 loan in Massachusetts is like a $300,000 loan in Nebraska," says Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, who favors raising limits to $800,000 in the most expensive markets. "All we're trying to do is control for geography." Mr. Stevens argues the expanded limits should stay temporary, in keeping with the FHA's traditional focus on first-time buyers. The FHA says the loans it is guaranteeing these days will turn a profit because the credit profile of its borrowers has improved. The average credit score for FHA borrowers has risen to 681, from 630 two years ago. The median U.S. score is about 720. Much of the improvement came as the FHA's lenders raised their own credit standards. Mr. Stevens, for his part, is painfully aware of how far the housing market is from recovery. He listed his northern Virginia home for sale last fall and already has slashed the asking price by $100,000, to $1.4 million. Before Christmas, he pulled the five-bedroom colonial off the market with plans to relist it later this year. He says he wants to live closer to Washington. "The commute is very hard," he says, "and the hours are very long." Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com Email

Tokyo Station is one of the few significant examples of early 20th century architecture left in Tokyo, let alone Japan. Here, the exterior of Tokyo Station when it opened in 1914 shows its brick front, Western style and domed roof. The Tokyo Station Hotel

November 30, 2011
Every generation or so, a scandal emerges that not only exposes the flaws of an institution but shakes entire industries to their foundations. For higher education, that scandal should be Penn State. The unfolding events of the Penn State sports scandal show a major university that has been more interested in protecting itself than in educating students or serving the public. The institutional reckoning must begin and end with the governing board. It is responsible for the actions of university leaders, and its members owe taxpayers and students accountability and transparency. The alleged sins of omission of football coach Joe Paterno, President Graham Spanier and others when it comes to Penn State's sports program are grave. And the board must address these tragic claims of child sexual abuse as a first priority. But a larger question must be asked about governing boards generally: Are they fulfilling their responsibility to the students, families and taxpayers in a broader sense? Can the trustees guarantee that they are adhering to their educational purpose? The clear answer is no. Edward Shils, distinguished service professor at the University of Chicago, saw the task of the university as the "discovery and teaching of truths about serious and important things." Could Penn State—or most other American universities for that matter—make such a claim today? Enlarge Image
Associated Press When the most highly paid employee is the football coach, not the president, it's clear something is awry. When football tickets and fancy student centers are the currency of the day, rather than affordable and quality education, clearly something is awry. When most classes are scheduled only between Tuesday and Thursday and the institutional answer is to build more buildings to accommodate the demand from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.—as Penn State is doing—something is awry. The health of our society depends directly on the health of our educational institutions, and we've got some work to do. In too many ways, the emphasis of higher education in general has become one of reputation building, not values or education. The instinct is to hide problems or pretend they don't exist rather than face them head on. At too many institutions around the country, we are graduating students who can't write or think critically and who won't be able to compete in the global marketplace. It is that tragedy in education that prompted Professor Richard Arum and the American Council of Trustees and Alumni to write to 10,000 college and university trustees earlier this fall calling on them to act. In his letter, Mr. Arum did not mince words. He noted that "problems of learning in higher education are real, deepening, and demand urgent attention. . . . Institutions that fail to set meaningful expectations, a rigorous curriculum and high standards for their students are putting these students and our country's future at risk." At the end of the day, we must hold boards accountable. Board members are acting in trust for taxpayers and students. If they do not act to ensure quality and integrity, then they are putting our students and our country's future at risk. Faculty are typically committed to their disciplines. Administrators regularly focus on the growth of their institutions. It is the governing board's duty to address these competing priorities. It is the trustees' duty to ensure that the distinctive educational purpose of the American university remains at the forefront of every other activity. Every college governing board should interpret Penn State's troubles as a clear warning of what happens when institutions lose sight of their educational mission. Ms. Neal is president of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni. Email

Real Bonding With Family Around the TV Via Skype
By
Walter S. Mossberg
January 26, 2012
As you read these words, millions of people are conducting video chats using the popular Skype service, now owned by Microsoft. Most of these calls are low-resolution encounters between two individuals, conducted over personal computers. This week, I tested a new device that aims to transform Skype video chats into room-size experiences, involving whole families or groups of friends on each end—seeing each other, chatting and sharing...

The living room in the upper duplex of a townhouse in Harlem is filled with pieces from the owner's art collection.
Natalie Keyssar for The Wall Street Journal For Doug Werner, moving from his three-family home in Harlem will be a pain. In addition to having to pack the usual possessions that make up a home, he also has to deal with his collection of more than 100 portraits, statues and numerous stuffed animals. At Home With an Art Collection
View Slideshow
A rear study area in the townhouse's upper duplex. Doug Werner and Corey Scott have collected more than 100 portraits, statues and numerous stuffed animals.
Natalie Keyssar for The Wall Street Journal Mr. Werner, a corporate medical director and an avid art collector, purchased the townhouse, which has one apartment and two duplexes, in 2009 for $1.05 million. Together with his partner Corey Scott, an interior designer, he moved into the upper duplex and decorated it with his art, using three rooms to feature works in his French, Californian and African collections. The townhouse is 3,600 square feet, not including a finished basement currently used as a recreation area by the lower duplex, which also has access to the garden measuring about 800 square feet. "Most of what I've purchased is through travel, and some of it through private individuals, some through dealers," says Mr. Werner, 47 years old, who lived in a 4,000-square-foot home in Arizona before the Harlem duplex. "Every few years, I think my taste changes a little bit," he says. "There's so much here I can't display." Since moving into the building, Messrs. Werner and Scott have increased their collection of African art, in particular with the addition of sculptures from the Shona tribe of Zimbabwe. The entrance of their duplex features a 600-pound statue of a woman pouring beer, and a sculpture of a water buffalo atop an antique Chinese cabinet occupies the townhouse's vestibule. The red-brick building on west 132nd Street in Harlem has three units and is listed for $1.595 million.

Natalie Keyssar for The Wall Street Journal The couple is in the process of relocating to San Francisco, where Mr. Werner has been selected as the director of clinical research at a biotechnology company. The townhouse is on the market for $1.595 million—not including the art. "I tried to set up the building…so that everyone would feel it was their home," says Mr. Werner, "not that they were walking into an entrance with a mailbox." Although he never imagined himself a landlord, Mr. Werner felt the purchase of the building was a "terrific bargain at the time, even in the recession," and he came around to the idea of having tenants instead of converting the home into a single-family space. Mr. Scott, 26, admits that he is a large reason the couple has amassed a taxidermy collection, which includes the mounted heads of six African bucks. They also have several smaller heads and three rugs, including one of a mountain lion. "When we first saw the home, it was stark and bare," says Mr. Scott. "But when we started putting furniture in, it felt like a completely different apartment. I could be completely modern, but that house to me didn't want that," he says, describing the pieces as "fitting." In addition to their own collection, the couple searched antique stores for fittings and moldings they felt were true to the time period of when the home was built in 1910, according to John McGuinness of Halstead Property. With the building's two terraces and a garden, each living unit has its own private outdoor space. Each is also fitted with granite countertops, a washer and dryer, hardwood floors and central air conditioning. A property developer did a gut renovation of the building in 2005, according to Mr. Werner. Write to Jackie Bischof at jackie.bischof@wsj.com Email

The Fall of Timbuktu
In Mali, the French have been the margin between civilization and barbarism.
Updated Feb. 4, 2013 12:01 a.m. ET
Reading accounts of France's struggles to deploy a few thousand troops to its former colony of Mali, we found ourselves wondering: Whatever happened to the French Foreign Legion? Next thing we know, the city of Timbuktu has been taken from al Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) by the Legion itself. Well, well: Tiens, voilà du boudin . Brush wars can be a dirty business. In respect to Mali, there's been no shortage of commentary noting that the government to whose rescue France has come is the product of a military coup. It is...

The recent market turmoil exposed a new weakness in the balance sheets of large banks: they hold so many bonds that they can't avoid trouble when interest rates rise. When long-term rates jumped by a full percentage point in May and June amid worries the Federal Reserve would taper its bond-buying stimulus program, bank investments in mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries got slammed.

Trading Plans Under Fire
Despite 2007 Warning, Experts Say Loopholes Remain for Corporate Insiders
By

In 2007, a top securities regulator warned that executives could be abusing preset plans to buy and sell their companies' stock "to facilitate trading based on inside information." "We're looking at this—hard," Linda Chatman Thomsen, then-enforcement chief at the Securities and Exchange Commission, told a conference of corporate lawyers. Since then, corporate insiders have filed more than one million forms...

Hensarling to Lead Financial Panel
By
Alan Zibel And Victoria McGrane Updated Nov. 28, 2012 6:20 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—The House panel that oversees financial issues is getting as its new leader a conservative who has been a vocal opponent of federal bailouts and government support for the financial sector. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas, not only wants to abolish government-controlled mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but also opposes replacing them with any new system of federal support for home loans. He...

WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
drew a red line in the budget showdown with Republicans, saying Democrats will demand additional revenue as part of any deal to alter the mandatory spending cuts set to hit at the beginning of next month. Enlarge Image
Sen. Harry Reid, left, says there are tax loopholes that should be closed.
Associated Press The comments, made in an interview Sunday with ABC's "This Week," come as Senate Democrats weigh options for averting at least some of the March 1 cuts, known in Washington as the sequester. One Democratic proposal would seek to offset some of the roughly $85 billion in cuts this year with a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. "There are a lot of tax loopholes that should be closed," the Senate's top Democrat said in the interview aired Sunday. He cited tax provisions for oil companies and for companies with operations overseas. The White House has called for similar steps as part of any deal to avert some of the March 1 cuts. President Barack Obama
on Sunday also said cutting the deficit will require raising more revenue, cutting spending and reforming health-care programs. In an interview with CBS, the president said he wants to close loopholes—not raise tax rates again—to pay down the country's debt and make the tax system more equitable. "There is no doubt we need additional revenue, coupled with smart spending reductions," Mr. Obama said. WSJ reporters talk about the unfinished agenda and the prospect of a confrontation over spending between the White House and Congress in March. Also: Is Hillary Clinton getting ready for another presidential run? (Photo: AP)
The deal enacted last month to avert the so-called fiscal cliff included a tax increase for individuals earning more than $400,000 and couples making more than $450,000. The president said he now wants to eliminate loopholes that allow some wealthy taxpayers to pay relatively low rates. He singled out carried-interest income as an area for change. Carried interest is a share of a partnership's profits that is taxed at capital-gains tax rates rather than at higher income-tax rates. On Capitol Hill, several Republican leaders in Congress have said they expect the sequester cuts to be implemented, at least temporarily, given how far apart the two sides are. Many GOP lawmakers support the across-the-board cuts as the only way now open to reduce government spending. At the same time, GOP lawmakers say they aren't willing to consider any more revenue increases, noting they already agreed to nearly $700 billion in new taxes as part of the last-minute deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff at the beginning of the year. "Washington needs to do something about its spending,' said Rep. Lou Barletta (R., Pa.), also on ABC's "This Week" program. "We are spiraling out of control." The Reid comments highlight a fundamental difference between the parties that promises to create strains all year as Republicans dig in against demands from Senate Democrats and the White House that any spending cuts be matched by tax increases. Mr. Reid said he was confident the general public supported that position. "The American people are on our side," he said. "The American people don't believe in these austere things. We believe that the rich should contribute. We believe we should fill those tax loopholes -- get rid of them, I should say." With the Pentagon set to get hit hard by the coming cuts, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Sunday that Congress would be committing "a shameful and irresponsible act" if it allows the defense cuts to proceed. The sharp reduction in spending, he said, would weaken U.S. readiness. Mr. Reid said he opposed shifting the balance of cuts away from the Pentagon. "If we're gonna have sequester, defense is gonna have to do their share," he said. Republicans in the GOP-controlled House twice last year passed legislation that would have shifted the defense portion of the cuts elsewhere in the federal budget, most notably cuts to the food-stamp program and a requirement forcing federal employees to contribute more to their retirement savings. The legislation never moved in the Senate. Senior House GOP aides have suggested that leadership may decide to bring that bill, or something similar to it, to the full House again for a vote, hoping to pressure Senate Democrats to move forward with their own bill to avert the cuts. The sequester is set to trim a wide range of federal spending and would be a down payment on the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade called for under current law. —Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.

Updated Sept. 15, 2006 12:01 a.m. ET
Staunton, Va. What did Shakespeare's plays look like on stage four centuries ago? If you've seen "Shakespeare in Love" or the first reel of Sir Laurence Olivier's film of "Henry V," you know that Elizabethan theaters were simple structures whose modest-size open stages were ringed on three sides by galleries. Because there were no sets to shift, the productions moved with terrific speed (thus explaining the reference in "Romeo and Juliet" to "the two hours' traffic of our stage"). When Thornton Wilder scrapped the fancy d&eacute;cor and illusion-spinning special effects of the modern proscenium-stage theater in "Our Town," all he was doing was turning back the clock. In theater, seeing is believing, and the best way to learn about 17th-century theatrical performance practices is to watch a Shakespeare play acted on a modern re-creation of an Elizabethan-style stage. The most famous of these is the replica of Shakespeare's own open-air Globe Theatre that was built on the banks of London's Thames River in 1997. The U.S. is home to a half-dozen such houses, including the indoor theater at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., and the open-air theaters that I saw earlier this year at the Oregon Shakespeare and Utah Shakespearean festivals. Most of the American replicas, however, are variously modernized structures that incorporate such anachronistic devices as theatrical lighting. If you want to see the real thing -- and to see it used in a convincing way -- the place to go is Staunton, home of the American Shakespeare Center, whose performances are given in a dazzlingly exact re-creation of the Blackfriars Playhouse, originally built in London in 1596. A Trip Back in Time Staunton is a smallish Virginia town (pop. 28,853) located some 2&frac12; hours southwest of Washington. Best known as the birthplace of Woodrow Wilson, it's not the sort of community where you'd normally go looking for first-rate theater. Yet that was what I found at the American Shakespeare Center, a year-round repertory company co-founded by Ralph Alan Cohen and Jim Warren that puts on 14 shows each season, all of them performed on the compact stage of the five-year-old Blackfriars Playhouse, whose elegant wood-and-plaster interior is encased within a modern architectural shell. To pass through the lobby doors into the 300-seat auditorium is like jumping into Mr. Peabody's Wayback Machine and setting the controls for 1600, with some allowances made for fire safety. Actors and audience are lit by the same electric chandeliers -- there are no spotlights -- and if you're fortunate enough to hold a ticket for one of the 12 "Lord's Chairs" placed on either side of the stage, you'll be close enough to the players to reach out and touch them. Details
AMERICAN SHAKESPEARE CENTER Blackfriars Playhouse 10 S. Market St., Staunton, Va. ($18-$36) 540-851-1733 or 877-MUCH-ADO AS YOU LIKE IT Closes Dec. 1 MACBETH Closes Dec. 2 OTHELLO Closes Dec. 3 Behind the Scenes All this would be of purely historical interest were it not for the high quality of the ASC's fast-moving productions, which are authentic (no sets, no scene breaks) but not antiquarian. The company consists of 11 mostly young men and women who perform in a cheerfully eclectic mishmash of period and modern dress. They speak their soliloquies and asides straight to the audience, and the uncomplicated stagings give the impression that you're seeing the play itself, naked and self-sufficient. I saw three of the four Shakespeare plays now alternating in repertory at the Blackfriars. All were satisfying, but the one I found most illuminating was "Othello," directed by co-founder Mr. Warren. It goes without saying that "Othello" is deadly serious, but Mr. Warren and his cast approached it from a surprising angle: Ren&eacute; Thornton Jr. was a crisply spoken, light-voiced Othello, Sarah Fallon an unabashedly sexy Desdemona, while James Keegan played the villainous Iago as a balding, middle-age clown. I don't think I've ever heard so much laughter at a performance of "Othello," which made the play's climactic explosion of madness and violence all the more shocking. Immensely Enjoyable Mr. Warren's staging of "As You Like It" was less surprising, if only because it's become so much more common in recent years to see Shakespeare's comedies acted with the speed and simplicity that are taken for granted at the Blackfriars Playhouse. Even so, it's always a treat to see Shakespeare performed in a small theater with an open, undecorated stage, and this frisky production is immensely enjoyable, not least because of the splendid Ms. Fallon, here cast as Rosalind. I would have preferred an older, more seasoned ensemble in "Macbeth," though I have a feeling that "great acting" of the star-in-the-limelight type might well seem out of place, even overblown, in an Elizabethan-style theater like the Blackfriars. Suffice it to say that these actors charge through co-founder Mr. Cohen's no-nonsense production as if they were riding an express train to hell, with Celia Madeoy giving an exceptionally vivid performance as Lady Macbeth. The narrow streets of downtown Staunton, where the Blackfriars Playhouse is located, are full of handsome 19th-century buildings, enticing storefronts and good restaurants. Even without Shakespeare thrown in, it'd be a nice place to spend a long weekend, and if you come on Friday and leave late Sunday afternoon, you can see as many as four different shows. (The current repertory also includes "The Tempest.") Why not go the limit and catch them all?

Finding a job in this economy -- even keeping one -- is tough. Tired of the uncertainty, some twentysomethings are going from job hunting to job creating by starting their own businesses. Generation Y entrepreneurs have a few advantages here: They're seen as tech-savvy, enthusiastic risk takers with fresh perspectives. But they also tend to lack money, credit histories and managerial experience. More Independent Street: Tips for Twentysomethings Some pointers if you're under 30 and starting a business: Ask for advice. You may know your "great idea" inside and out, but you might not know as much about writing a business plan, incorporating a company, or managing employees. Reach out to more established business owners by tapping your college-alumni network or finding a support group such as Score, a group of about 11,000 volunteer business executives who counsel entrepreneurs in person or online at Score.org. "I think the first challenge that I had was wondering where to start," says Joel Erb, who started a Web design company at age 15 and has since expanded it to offer new-media marketing and communications services. Mr. Erb, now 25, taught himself computer coding but learned how to incorporate, finance and expand his company, named INM United, from his mentors. Be realistic on funding. Finding capital for a start-up today is difficult regardless of your age, but you might be set back further by a weak credit history and lack of business experience. To show that you're serious, write a business plan and have a prototype before you approach a bank or investor. When Miles Lasater founded a financial-services firm tailored to colleges with two fellow undergraduates at Yale University, they set measurable goals for growth and followed up with possible investors after achieving their aims. "We were able to show how we progressed," says the 31-year-old Mr. Lasater, who was 22 when he started Higher One, which streamlines the transfer of money between financial-aid offices and students for more than 210 colleges. "So we raised money from people later who said no the first time." Not having a lot of money at first could actually be good, as "it forces you to be frugal," says Donna Fenn, the author of a coming book about young entrepreneurs and a contributing editor at Inc. magazine. Search for targeted loans. Try seeking out loans offered specifically for younger entrepreneurs, sometimes made by organizations dedicated to supporting businesses. For example, the Association for Enterprise Opportunity offers loans of up to $15,000 to people who complete the Prudential Young Entrepreneurs Program, a 10- to 12-week course for 18- to 30-year-olds in Newark, N.J., and Philadelphia. Find a good lawyer. Preferably you should have one that has experience with start-ups. "You can do almost anything else yourself," says Mr. Lasater. But there is no way around this one. You can try to negotiate fees or find someone to do the work pro bono, but don't try to start a business without an attorney. You need one to help you patent your ideas, incorporate your business and protect your interests when dealing with investors. That's especially the case if you find a deep-pocketed "angel" investor. "You need to be careful that you don't give all of your business away just to get money," says Jerry Ross of the Disney Entrepreneur Center, a nonprofit in Orlando, Fla. Email: jonnelle.marte@wsj.com
