U.S. stocks finished a touch higher as investors calibrated two positive readings on the U.S. economy against hopes for more help from the Federal Reserve. Stocks fluttered near the flatline, with an updated read on second-quarter economic growth that matched expectations and better-than-expected housing data failing to inspire investors.
Stocks rose on fresh signs of improvement in the housing market, with gains led by consumer-discretionary companies, a category that includes home builders. Steven Russolillo has details on The News Hub.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 4.49 points, or 0.03%, to 13107.48 for its first gain in three days. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 1.19 points, or 0.08%, to 1410.49, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 4.05 points, or 0.13%, to 3081.19. With two days remaining in the month, the blue-chip Dow has added 0.8% so far in August, while the S&P 500 has tacked on 2.3%. Leading the day's gains were telecommunications and consumer discretionary stocks. Verizon Communications

was the biggest decliner on the Dow. The modest gains came after a pair of readings on the U.S. economy came in better than expected. A revision to U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter showed growth at 1.7% from the previous quarter, higher than an original reading of 1.5% and in-line with economists' expectations. The stronger reading reflects higher consumer spending and fewer imports. Enlarge Image

Reuters Separately, pending home sales for July increased 2.4% in July after declining 1.4% in June. The rise exceeded the 1% gain expected by analysts and pushed the number of pending home sales to the highest since April 2010. The Federal Reserve also released its "beige book" report on economic conditions around the country, which saw modest and moderate growth across the U.S. Most districts saw steady or "slightly" growing employment. That report jibed with expectations that the Fed could soon act to boost the economy, with more clarity to come as soon as Friday, when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke
speaks at a meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo. "It's clear to me that while the stimulus program may not have as much of an economic impact, the anticipation for what these programs might be is significant... Every time Bernanke has hinted, the market has a positive reaction," says Omar Aguilar,
chief investment officer of equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management. However, after a summer rally driven by what Mr. Aguilar believes are broad expectations for more easing, "the expectations are so high relative to what's happening that we're probably set for a disappointment," he says.

boosted hopes that the ECB will act to stabilize the borrowing costs of the euro-zone's frail economies. The Stoxx Europe 600 ended the day down 0.1%. Asian markets were mixed. The Shanghai Composite fell 1% to close at a fresh 3½-year low, and Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.4%. China's Xinhua News Agency reported that China's top economic planner said a rebound in housing prices would need to be prevented to curb speculative demand. Crude-oil futures fell 0.9% to $95.49 a barrel after the Group of Seven leading industrialized economies called for a lift in oil production in the face of fears about Hurricane Isaac
and tensions in Iran. Gold futures slipped 0.4% to $1,659.80 an ounce. The dollar fell against the euro but rose slightly against the yen. Demand for Treasurys fell, pushing the yield on the 10-year note higher to 1.652%. Does August's trading volume seem too low? Mark Hulbert joins Markets Hub to discuss what to look out for.

The move came after strong international criticism over the piracy charge that carried a punishment of up to 15 years in jail. It also followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's remarks that the...

If postseason experience is as important as it is made out to be, place your bets on the Detroit Tigers facing the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series for the fourth time and on the Tigers winning it all for the first time since 1984. In a quest to define exactly who has the most and least postseason experience, Stats, LLC tallied all the postseason at-bats and innings pitched for current members of each postseason roster. We also included some result numbers to enrich the conversation. Enlarge Image
TK What jumps out most about the Tigers is a whopping 203 postseason innings pitched, combined with an impressive 14-10 record and a 3.50 ERA. The Red Sox, meanwhile, have a lot of postseason experience on the hill (158.2 IP), but the results have been much less pretty (5-10, 4.20). In the hitting department, the Tigers, Cards and Red Sox again dominate in quantity. But here, St. Louis' and Boston's bats trump the Tigers. Though one thinks of the Atlanta Braves as a perennial playoff team, the 2013 version isn't particularly seasoned. And though the Dodgers' spending spree bought a lot of postseason experience from the plate, the pitchers are relatively new to this stage. Finally, even though the Tampa Bay Rays were in the playoffs just two seasons ago, they bring a measly 29.1 innings of postseason mound experience to 2013. Essentially only David Price, Jeremy Hellickson and Joel Peralta remain as major parts from that 2011 pitching staff. —Steve Moyer

Updated Oct. 26, 2012 6:59 p.m. ET
We all say Ohio, Ohio, Ohio. But it's all still Denver, Denver, and the mystery that maybe isn't a mystery at all. If Cincinnati and Lake County go for Mitt Romney on Nov. 6 it will be because of what happened in Denver on Oct. 3. If Barack Obama
barely scrapes through, if there's a bloody and prolonged recount, it too will be because of Denver. Enlarge Image
President Barack Obama
Reuters Nothing echoes out like that debate. It was the moment that allowed Mr. Romney to break through, that allowed dismay with the incumbent to coalesce, that allowed voters to consider the alternative. What the debate did to the president is what the Yankees' 0-4 series against the Tigers did at least momentarily, to the team's relationship with their city. "Dear Yankees, We don't date losers. Signed, New Yorkers" read the Post's headline. America doesn't date losers either. Why was the first debate so toxic for the president? Because the one thing he couldn't do if he was going to win the election is let all the pent-up resentment toward him erupt. Americans had gotten used to him as The President. Whatever his policy choices, whatever general direction he seemed to put in place he was The President, a man who had gotten there through natural gifts and what all politicians need, good fortune. What he couldn't do was present himself, when everyone was looking, as smaller than you thought. Petulant, put upon, above it all, full of himself. He couldn't afford to make himself look less impressive than the challenger in terms of command, grasp of facts, size. But that's what he did. And in some utterly new way the president was revealed, exposed. All the people whose job it is to surround and explain him, to act as his buffers and protectors—they weren't there. It was him on the stage, alone with a competitor. He didn't have a teleprompter, and so his failure seemed to underscore the cliché that the prompter is a kind of umbilical cord for him, something that provides nourishment, the thing he needs to sound good. He is not by any means a stupid man but he has become a boring one; he drones, he is predictable, it's never new. The teleprompter adds substance, or at least safety. *** A great and assumed question, the one that's still floating out there, is what exactly happened when Mr. Obama did himself in? What led to it? Was it the catastrophic execution of an arguably sound strategy? Perhaps the idea was to show the president was so unimpressed by his challenger that he could coolly keep him at bay by not engaging. Maybe Mr. Obama's handlers advised: "The American people aren't impressed by this flip-flopping, outsourcing plutocrat, and you will deepen your bond with the American people, Mr. President, by expressing in your bearing, through your manner and language, how unimpressed you are, too." So he sat back and let Mr. Romney come forward. But Mr. Romney was poised, knowledgeable, presidential. It was a mistake to let that come forward! Peggy Noonan's Blog Daily declarations from the Wall Street Journal columnist.
Was it the catastrophic execution of a truly bad strategy? Maybe they assumed the election was already pretty much in the bag, don't sweat it, just be your glitteringly brilliant self and let Duncan the Wonder Horse go out there and turn people off. But nothing was in the bag. The sheer number of people who watched—a historic 70 million—suggests a lot of voters were still making up their minds. Maybe the president himself didn't think he could possibly be beaten because he's so beloved. Presidents are always given good news, to keep their spirits up. The poll numbers he'd been seeing, the get-out-the-vote reports, the extraordinary Internet effort to connect with every lonely person in America, which is a lot of persons—maybe everything he was hearing left him thinking his position was impregnable. But maybe these questions are all off. Maybe what happened isn't a mystery at all. That, anyway, is the view expressed this week by a member of the U.S. Senate who served there with Mr Obama and has met with him in the White House. People back home, he said, sometimes wonder what happened with the president in the debate. The senator said, I paraphrase: I sort of have to tell them that it wasn't a miscalculation or a weird moment. I tell them: I know him, and that was him. That guy on the stage, that's the real Obama. *** Which gets us to Bob Woodward's "The Price of Politics," published last month. The portrait it contains of Mr. Obama—of a president who is at once over his head, out of his depth and wholly unaware of the fact—hasn't received the attention it deserves. Throughout the book, which is a journalistic history of the president's key economic negotiations with Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama is portrayed as having the appearance and presentation of an academic or intellectual while being strangely clueless in his reading of political situations and dynamics. He is bad at negotiating—in fact doesn't know how. His confidence is consistently greater than his acumen, his arrogance greater than his grasp. He misread his Republican opponents from day one. If he had been large-spirited and conciliatory he would have effectively undercut them, and kept them from uniting. (If he'd been large-spirited with Mr. Romney, he would have undercut him, too.) Instead he was toughly partisan, he shut them out, and positions hardened. In time Republicans came to think he doesn't really listen, doesn't really hear. So did some Democrats. Business leaders and mighty CEOs felt patronized: After inviting them to meet with him, the president read from a teleprompter and included the press. They felt like "window dressing." One spoke of Obama's surface polish and essential remoteness. In negotiation he did not cajole, seduce, muscle or win sympathy. He instructed. He claimed deep understanding of his adversaries and their motives but was often incorrect. He told staffers that John Boehner, one of 11 children of a small-town bar owner, was a "country club Republican." He was often patronizing, which in the old and accomplished is irritating but in the young and inexperienced is infuriating. "Boehner said he hated going down to the White House to listen to what amounted to presidential lectures," Mr. Woodward writes. Mr. Obama's was a White House that had—and showed—no respect for trying to negotiate with other Republicans. Through it all he was confident—"Eric, don't call my bluff"—because he believed, as did his staff, that his talents would save the day. They saved nothing. Washington became immobilized. Mr. Woodward's portrait of the president is not precisely new—it has been drawn in other ways in other accounts, and has been a staple of D.C. gossip for three years now—but it is vivid and believable. And there's probably a direct line between that portrait and the Obama seen in the first debate. Maybe that's what made it so indelible, and such an arc-changer. People saw for the first time an Obama they may have heard about on radio or in a newspaper but had never seen. They didn't see some odd version of the president. They saw the president. And they didn't like what they saw, and that would linger.

Republic Wireless has a service for those who want to pay only $19 a month for unlimited data, voice, and text, but they have to use the Motorola Defy XT Smart Phone, which Walt Mossberg says is mediocre. (Photo: Republic Wireless)
A typical smartphone costs around $200, but it's usually shackled to a two-year contract that often costs $70 or more monthly and includes limits on data consumption, voice minutes and texts. Even prepaid smartphones, without a contract, can cost $30 to $50 a month and carry limits. But I've been testing an Android smartphone from an upstart carrier that charges just $19 a month for unlimited data, voice and texts—with no contract. That's right: $19 a month, unlimited. Motorola's Defy XT is the only phone that works with Republic's network.
Republic Wireless Mossberg's Mailbox A New View on Windows This carrier is called Republic Wireless, a private firm in Raleigh, N.C., which launched its service in December. The sole phone that works with the company's technology is a Motorola model, the Defy XT. The phone costs $249—partly to help offset the low monthly price. However, as of Tuesday, the company is offering a second pricing option for people who would rather pay less up front: $99 for the phone and then $29 a month, unlimited. That's still a bargain service price. The phone and two service plans are only available online, at republicwireless.com. The company offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. And to sweeten the deal, Republic says Motorola will be offering customers a $50 credit at the Google

So what's the catch? Well, Republic is using an unusual technology approach that's smart and may even represent the future. But today, it doesn't deliver the best voice quality and it requires a specially equipped phone. The sole phone that works with the system now is mediocre. Republic is mostly able to offer such low monthly prices because it's a Wi-Fi-centric carrier. That means whenever you make a voice call while the phone is connected to a Wi-Fi network, your Republic phone places it over Wi-Fi rather than using a costlier cellular phone network. The same is true of texts. You aren't limited to Wi-Fi calling and texting—the phone can make calls, send texts and connect to the Internet over Sprint's cellular network, at no extra charge. But Republic believes so many people connect their phones to Wi-Fi so often that most calls and other activity will be conducted over Wi-Fi, saving the company money on payments it makes to Sprint. And it says it has developed a system that properly places 911 calls over Wi-Fi, which has often been a problem. Wi-Fi phone calls aren't new, or unique to Republic. You can easily install an app on your iPhone or Android phone that will place calls over the Internet via Wi-Fi, just like Republic. But these apps generally require you to use a separate dialer and have a separate phone number. Republic's phone is what it calls a "hybrid" device—the main dialer and text-messaging modules have been configured to work on either Wi-Fi or the cellular network, without the need to launch an app. The phone defaults to Wi-Fi but will place the call over Sprint if it decides the Wi-Fi connection isn't good enough, or if you manually choose cellular. In my tests, conducted in and around Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Silicon Valley, call quality was adequate, text service worked normally, and Web browsing and apps mostly worked OK, at my home, office and public Wi-Fi hot spots in airports and coffee shops. But there were definite downsides. First is the phone itself. The Defy XT is a chunky device with a lower-resolution screen than any current iPhone or leading Android model. It comes with only about 2.5 gigabytes of usable storage, compared with a more typical 16 gigabytes on other phones, though you can expand the storage by buying a larger memory card. It has a relatively small 3.7 inch display. And when it isn't on Wi-Fi, it can only use an older-type, slow, 3G network. Plus, it runs a clunky, old version of Android called Gingerbread that was released two years ago. Republic says it plans to roll out several better phones running current versions of Android and much faster networks, including the best—4G LTE—starting in late summer. Second, there's no seamless handoff between Wi-Fi calls and cellular calls. If you leave a Wi-Fi coverage area, the call drops, and, after a brief but annoying delay, the phone will redial the call over Sprint. Republic says it plans to roll out a feature this summer that will cut the handoff to seconds and make it nearly seamless. Third is call quality. Wi-Fi calls have come a long way and in my tests, most were adequate, meaning the other person on the call and I could understand each other. But many of my calls had some slight echo effect or occasional clipped words, despite a recent software update intended to fix the problem. There was a noticeable improvement when I made the call on the same phone over Sprint. The phone even displays a button during calls, called informally "the escape hatch," which allows you to kill the Wi-Fi call and force the phone to redial the other person over Sprint for no added charge. But in general, I found the Wi-Fi calling acceptable, if not pristine, as long as I wasn't walking too far away from the Wi-Fi hot spot. Finally, there's almost no company-provided customer service. Republic relies on online forums of avid customers—its "community"—to provide help to users with problems. You can get help from an employee through these forums, but that's not typical. If you can live with these limitations, Republic Wireless can save you a lot of money. —Find all of Walt Mossberg's columns and videos at the All Things Digital website, walt.allthingsd.com.

If anything characterizes the fashions of pop and youth culture, it's that they are always, in Carly Simon's
words, coming around again. Like Nietzsche's
"eternal return of the same," any movement—from rockabilly to heavy metal, electronica to soul—that attracted followers the first time round eventually gets rediscovered and revived, often several times. PRETTY THINGS: 'John Rothermel in a Fashion Pose (Cockette)' (1973) by Peter Hujar, at Tate Liverpool
The Peter Hujar Archive, LLC; courtesy of Pace/MacGill Gallery, New York Related Reading Bowie Is Back David Bowie, Member of the Band One, however, has never been revived, and has been almost universally reviled since its heyday: glam rock. It's not hard to see why. Even teenagers, with their boundless enthusiasm for looking ridiculous, have to draw the line somewhere, and the artificial fabrics and science-fiction design of glam rock's outfits, which make the costumes in the closing credits of "Mamma Mia!" look understated, are some way beyond that limit. As for the music, while prominent exponents like David Bowie
and Roxy Music
became highly influential and credible, they left glam behind. Yet songs by bands like Slade,
T-Rex, Sweet and Wizzard never quite went away—at least in the U.K., birthplace and stronghold of the form. Though staples of the pub jukebox and the office Christmas party, they were rather guilty pleasures. With their foot-stomping basslines and too-catchy choruses, they were for singing along to after too much to drink, rather than anything to be taken seriously. Suddenly, however, glam is back in the spotlight. The Liverpool Tate gallery has mounted an exhibition devoted to the form, drawing hitherto unsuspected connections between it and the work of artists like David Hockney
and Andy Warhol
(about whom Mr. Bowie wrote a song). Mr. Bowie himself is the subject of a show at the V&A, which will include some of the singer's stage costumes from his Ziggy Stardust
incarnation. This renewed attention makes several things apparent. The first is that much of the music is better crafted than its reputation suggests—but also much more tied to the conventions of pop and rock 'n' roll. The difference is almost all performative; it's in how these songs were presented. The second is that, as so often with youth fashions that outraged parents of the time, nostalgia and hindsight render what seemed threateningly lascivious and dangerously rebellious almost innocent. “
Nostalgia and hindsight render what seemed threateningly lascivious and dangerously rebellious almost innocent.
”
Now that all the young dudes whom Mott the Hoople hymned are old news, David Bowie's pretty things, driving their mamas and papas insane, don't look so much like "the start of the coming race." They're more like something recognizably in the tradition of vaudeville, a line that runs from pantomime through to Alice Cooper
(still cheerfully hamming it up, aged 65). There is, though, one feature of glam rock—not unrelated to the innuendo of those traditional entertainments—which proved revolutionary. The youth culture of the 1960s may have promoted sexual license, but glam rock was the first mainstream pop movement to trade on androgyny and sexual ambiguity. What outraged parents four decades ago wasn't the music, but Marc Bolan's
makeup and Mr. Bowie's flaunted bisexuality. Today's general tolerance of different sexual preferences may owe more than we realized to preposterous outfits, hair glitter and catchy three-chord tunes. Perhaps the greatest mark of glam rock's influence is the fact that most of the public think these transgressive statements now look rather quaint. Civilization didn't crumble; it was all just a bit of fun. Explore More

by using a controversial tactic: requiring people to use the Google+ social network. The result is that people who create an account to use Gmail, YouTube and other Google services—including the Zagat restaurant-review website—are also being set up with public Google+ pages that can be viewed by anyone online. Google+ is a Facebook rival and one of the company's most important recent initiatives as it tries to snag more online advertising dollars. Enlarge Image
Google+ users are encouraged to create digital "circles" of friends and spend time interacting with them on the Google+ site, akin to Facebook.
Getty Images The impetus comes from the top. Google Chief Executive Larry Page
has sought more aggressive measures to get people to use Google+, two people familiar with the matter say. Google created Google+ in large part to prevent Facebook from dominating the social-networking business. Google+ seeks to challenge Facebook by improving its integration with other Google services. Social media expert Jay Oatway explains why users are warming up to Google+.
Both Facebook and Google make the vast bulk of their revenue from selling ads. But Facebook has something Google wants: Facebook can tie people's online activities to their real names, and it also knows who those people's friends are. Marketers say Google has told them that closer integration of Google+ across its many properties will allow Google to obtain this kind of information and target people with more relevant (and therefore, more profitable) ads. Some users of Google's services are startled to learn how far the integration can reach. Sam Ford, a 26-year-old Navy petty officer, says he signed up for Google+ on his smartphone because it would let him automatically upload new photos to a Google+ folder—one that he kept private. Later, he says, he was surprised to see that his Google+ profile page—which includes his name—was tied to a software review that he wrote recently on the Google Play online store. Enlarge Image
Google is "trying too hard to compete with Facebook, and if people aren't going to share willingly, they'll make them share unwillingly," he says. A Google spokeswoman says the company began requiring use of Google+ profiles to write reviews to improve the quality of the critiques, which was lower when people were able to leave reviews anonymously. The change also allows people to see reviews by their friends, she says. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment. Google executives say more integration is coming. "Google+ is Google," says Vice President Bradley Horowitz.
"The entry points to Google+ are many, and the integrations are more every day." The initiative has been controversial within Google. Some employees viewed it as a desperate attempt to catch up to Facebook while others believe it is the company's best path to being relevant in the age of social media, said people familiar with the matter. Mr. Page, the CEO, about a year ago pushed the idea of requiring Google users to sign on to their Google+ accounts simply to view reviews of businesses, the people say. Google executives persuaded him not to pursue that strategy, fearing it would irritate Google search users, the people say. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter. In recent months, Google has pressed ahead with other forms of integration. This past fall, for instance, Google began requiring people who want to post their reviews of restaurants or other businesses to use their Google+ profiles to do so. The same rule applies for reviews of smartphone software "apps," as well as physical goods, obtained through Google. Links to Google+ also appear in Google search-engine results involving people and brands that have set up a Google+ account. Vic Gundotra,
who is in charge of Google+, says he sees little in-house controversy today. "There was more resistance two years ago," when the project wasn't well understood internally, he says. More on Google+ Is Google+ Really That Controversial? The Mounting Minuses at Google+ 2/28/12 Google Takes On Friend Sprawl 6/29/11 Google Wants Search to Be More Social 3/31/11 Facebook's New Front in Google Rivalry 11/15/10 Google Develops a Facebook Rival 7/28/10 The integration has helped increase Google+ usage. Google last month said 235 million people used Google+ features—such as clicking on a "+1" button, similar to Facebook's "Like" button—across Google's sites, up from 150 million in late June. By using its top websites to help Google+, the company has shown how far it is willing to go to battle Facebook to become a gateway for Internet users to communicate with each other and businesses. Because using Google+ requires people to sign in to their Google accounts, Google will be able to blend mounds of data about individual users' search habits and the websites they visit with their activities on Google+. That is a potential boon to Google's ad business, from which the company derives about 95% of its more than $40 billion in annual revenue, excluding its new Motorola phone-making unit. Google is "sitting on a mountain of data," says Alan Osetek,
president of Resolution Media, which helps marketers buy ads on Google. He says "click-through rates"—the rates at which Google search users click on ads—have increased for his clients' ads when they include information from Google+, such as the number of people who have recommended a brand by clicking the +1 button on the brand's Google+ page. "In the majority of cases, lift in click-through rates ranged from 2% to 15%," he says. Users' Google+ profile pages typically include their real names, and they can add other details such as their hometowns. By default, the page is public and will turn up in a Google search. It is possible, however, to change a setting so that the page doesn't show up in search results. There is also a way for people to disable or delete their Google+ accounts. Although Google doesn't reveal a user's name to advertisers, Google uses information about the person's Web visits and interests to help marketers target ads more accurately, Google says. Mr. Gundotra, the Google+ chief, says the company won't share data about individual users with advertisers and that it is important for the company to maintain users' trust. Google encourages account holders to use Google+ to share photos and thoughts with friends or other Google+ users who share their interests. Integrating Google+ with the rest of the company's properties helps users glean more information about apps, businesses, websites, products and—most important for Google's business—ads for those products. That is because Google+ users can be notified if their Google+ friends or other contacts recommend the items. "You'll go to search for a camp stove on Google, and you'll find that your friend just bought one, and you'll be able to ask him about it," says Dylan Casey,
a former Google+ product manager who now works at Path Inc., a smartphone-based social network. Since Google+ made its debut in mid-2011, the Mountain View, Calif., company has had limited success getting people to spend time directly on the Google+ site. Research firm comScore Inc. a year ago estimated that Google+ users spent an average of three minutes on the site each month, versus more than 400 minutes for the average Facebook user. In the U.S., Google+ had nearly 28.7 million unique visitors through PCs in October—well below Facebook's 149 million, comScore says. Those numbers don't include mobile-device users. —Evelyn M.
