Updated Dec. 29, 2013 12:32 a.m. ET
SCOTIA, Calif.—Tucked away in a river bend behind a curtain of redwood trees, Scotia is an old-fashioned company town with a contemporary twist: The company that owns the town is a New York hedge fund. Marathon Asset Management, with roughly $11 billion under management, never wanted to be in the business of replacing broken toilets and evicting the occasional marijuana grower. But in 2008, a bankruptcy court awarded ownership of Scotia, including its 272 homes, two churches, a hotel and several commercial buildings, to...

The U.S. launched a drone strike in Yemen on Thursday aimed at killing Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born radical cleric suspected of orchestrating terrorist attacks in the U.S, but he evaded the missile, Yemeni and U.S. officials said. Enlarge Image
Anwar al-Awlaki in a video released late last year. Reuters The attack came days after a U.S. Navy SEALs team killed Osama bin Laden at a compound in Pakistan. Had Thursday's strike succeeded, the U.S. would have killed two of the most-wanted terrorists in a week. Mr. Awlaki has emerged as a leading charismatic front-man of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a group the U.S. considers the world's most active terror organization. With bin Laden's death, some officials believe Mr. Awlaki and the Yemen-based group now represent the gravest threat to the U.S. He has been linked to at least three major incidents: the Ft. Hood shootings, the Christmas 2009 plot to blow up a U.S.-bound passenger plane and a plan to blow up cargo planes. The attack appears to be unrelated to intelligence information taken in the raid that killed bin Laden, whose death was confirmed by al Qaeda Friday in a statement that vowed to continue attacks on Americans.

More photos and interactive graphics Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been more forthcoming with information on Mr. Awlaki since the president has faced major protests in his country, a U.S. official said. Mr. Saleh has sought to use that information in an effort to gain more U.S. support, the official added. The White House has backed an Arab proposal that would ease Mr. Saleh from office. The Yemen strike sends a clear message that despite turmoil in the Middle East and the success of the bin Laden operation, the U.S. is resolved to ratchet up a campaign against Mr. Awlaki and other members of his group. The attempt to kill Mr. Awlaki was the first known U.S. military strike inside Yemen since May 2010, when U.S. missiles mistakenly killed one of Mr. Saleh's envoys and an unknown number of other people. That soured relations and prompted the administration to pull back. U.S. strikes between December 2009 and May 2010 were carried out by U.S. military aircraft and cruise missiles, not the kind of armed drones used in Thursday's attack. The last known strike by an unmanned aircraft in Yemen was conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency in 2002. According to a Yemeni account of Thursday's strike, the U.S. launched two separate attacks within 45 minutes aimed at Mr. Awlaki in the southern province of Shebwa, which is considered an AQAP stronghold. The strike was conducted by the U.S. military, but the operation—like the bin Laden raid—appears to have benefitted from close cooperation between the Department of Defense, the CIA and Yemeni officials. In the first strike, the U.S. fired three rockets at a pickup truck in which Mr. Awlaki and a Saudi national and suspected al Qaeda member were traveling outside the village of Jahwa, located some 20 miles away from the Shebwa provincial capital, said local residents and the Yemeni security official. Those missiles didn't hit their target. Two Yemeni brothers, who were known by local residents for giving shelter to al Qaeda militants, rushed to the scene of the attack. Mr. Awlaki switched vehicles with them, leaving the two Yemenis in the pickup. A single drone then hit the pickup truck, killing the Yemenis inside. Mr. Awlaki escaped in the other vehicle along with the Saudi. A Yemeni defense ministry official identified the two dead men as Musaid Mubarak Al-Daghari and his brother Abdullah.Unlike the bin Laden raid, which was carried out without Pakistani knowledge, the Yemeni government was a participant. "The Yemeni government gave the U.S. authorities vital details of Awlaki's whereabouts in Shabwa days ago," said a senior Yemeni security official. The official said the Yemeni government had full knowledge of the attack ahead of the U.S. strike. U.S. counterterrorism officials have been worried in recent weeks that the unrest in Yemen, and Mr. Saleh's increasingly weak position, had given a free hand to AQAP to plot fresh attacks against the West. In the past several weeks, more than half of the U.S.-trained and funded Yemeni counter-terrorism forces assigned to Shebwa have left their posts. Many have been ordered to redploy in the capital, where Mr. Saleh has been besieged by thousands of protesters and army units which have defected from his command. The timing of the Awlaki attack appears to be a calculated move by the Yemeni president to prove his counter-terrorism credentials to international allies like America and Saudi Arabia, which have been involved in intense diplomatic negotiations to get him to step down from office. Mr. Awlaki has been on the run from Yemeni authorities since the failed Christmas 2009 underwear bomber attempted to blow up a U.S.-bound passenger plane. He was living under the protection of his extended tribe and regional intelligence officials have criticized what they have seen as a lack of resolve by Yemeni security officials to pursue Mr. Awlaki. The Yemeni security official said Friday that his government believed that Awlaki had been hiding in Abdan village for approximately two weeks. The official said that the Yemeni government shared this intelligence with their U.S. counterparts on Wednesday. U.S. officials say finding Mr. Awlaki and other senior AQAP leaders has proven difficult. The U.S. lacks a robust intelligence network on the ground and the U.S.-born cleric has ditched electronic communications in favor of hard-to-track couriers to relay messages, officials said. The U.S. campaign in Yemen has been led by the U.S. military's Central Command, but the CIA has been providing intelligence and other support. Mr. Awlaki came to prominence in 2009 due to his role as Internet-based spiritual guide aiding the radicalization of a new generation of Islamist extremists. He isn't the head of AQAP, but U.S. officials say Mr. Awlaki has assumed an operational leadership role in the terror group. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, who is accused of killing 13 people in a November 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood Texas, corresponded with Mr. Awlaki before his attack. The U.S. added Mr. Awlaki to the CIA's target list after AQAP's failed attempt a month later to blow up a U.S.-bound passenger airliner. Part of Mr. Awlaki's appeal, say U.S. officials and terrorism experts, is his ability to act as a bridge between the mainly Arab leaders of al Qaeda and willing potential jihadists in the West. Born in New Mexico, he preached at a mosque in Northern Virginia until 2002, when he left the U.S. to spend time building a following in the U.K., before returning to Yemen in 2004. Yemen authorities, at the behest of the U.S. arrested him, but then released him in December 2007 saying they did not have enough evidence to hold him. —Siobhan Gorman contributed to this article.

WASHINGTON—The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits fell to near a five-year low, a sign that businesses are seeing higher demand and may be stepping up hiring. Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, declined by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 339,000 in the week ended April 20, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the lowest level since early March and the second-lowest since January 2008. Economists...

To get to his vacation home, Bruce Porter
charters a plane for $50 per person, one way, to land on a remote island's grassy airstrip. He then walks half a mile to get to his cabin, about a quarter-mile away from his closest neighbor. There is no cell service—or even a paved road, for that matter. But the six weeks he and his family spend at a tiny island off the coast of Maine every year are some of his best, he says. Like Mr. Porter, modern-day pioneers are in search of a place where they can truly get away from email, cellphones and social obligations. While it's getting more difficult to find pockets of land that are both beautiful and largely undeveloped, Mansion scoured the globe for these final frontiers. Be warned: It's not exactly the easy life. Settlers here may face challenges in finding transportation, reliable electricity and even clean water—not to mention a decent cup of coffee. But for those willing to stake their claim, a private haven awaits. Along the Kafue River and the Banks of Lake Kariba, Zambia Siavonga District Snapshot Siavonga district population: 89,787 Foreign eligibility: To buy land, foreigners typically become minority shareholders in a company incorporated in Zambia that has 75% of its shares owned by Zambians. Infrastructure: In remote areas, it's fairly challenging to hook up electricity, so most homes run on solar power and a generator. Most people drill a borehole for water and dig a septic system for sewers. Enlarge Image
Michael Newhouse Zambia is one of the fastest-growing countries in Africa, fueled by an influx of Chinese investors in the mining sector and the country's push to upgrade its infrastructure, repairing and building almost 5,000 miles of roads outside of major cities. What's more, Zambia's relatively stable democracy and English-speaking population make it attractive to foreigners. The western bank of Lake Kariba, the world's largest man-made lake, is lined with unspoiled forests and small villages. (Zambia and Zimbabwe split the lake, with the eastern bank located in Zimbabwe.) A growing number of wealthy residents who live in Lusaka, the country's capital, are driving the 2½ hours to Lake Kariba for weekend getaways. Visitors enjoy going on safari in many of the nearby national parks and seeing lions, antelope, elephants and hipposor traveling to Victoria Falls. Higher-end homes in Zambia cost between $74 and $186 per square foot to build. Homes typically are constructed of cinder block, with porcelain floor tiles, tiled roofs and granite countertops. While the standards are fairly high, the quality of finishes is not up to U.S. standards, says Inutu Zaloumis, a managing director of Pam Golding Properties Zambia in Lusaka. Of course, slick finishes aren't the biggest worries when living along the river or on the banks of Lake Kariba. Pollution is a significant problem, with runoff from the copper industry flowing into the Kafue River and contaminating the water supply. (Lake Kariba's local leaders are seeking government approval to sink more boreholes.) Also, there have been crocodile-related deaths on the shores of Lake Kariba. Still, the area is a draw for houseboat enthusiasts, who gather in Siavonga, one of the larger towns on the lake, says Janet Irwin, director of real-estate firm Homenet Zambia. The Kimberley Region, Australia Broome Snapshot Population of Broome: 16,031 Foreign eligibility: Foreigners can buy land, but they must apply and meet certain criteria set by the Foreign Investment Review Board. Infrastructure: Four-wheelers are the norm for this rugged territory where there's one main highway—and a wet season that can wash out roads. Power comes from diesel generators, solar power and some hydroelectric power. Many residents draw water from boreholes.
Enlarge Image
Michael Newhouse Located in northwestern Australia, the Kimberley is one of the most exotic habitable areas in the world, with its vibrant red soil, sweeping gorges and abundant flora and fauna. "When you're walking around in some areas it feels like no one has ever walked here before," says Don Hodgson,
who moved to the area about five years ago. Mr. Hodgson and his wife, Jan, used to live in Sydney, where they ran a culinary business. They vacationed in the Kimberley before purchasing property there. They now live in Coconut Well, an area that's about 12 miles away from Broome, the town considered to be the gateway to the Kimberley. They're fairly self-sufficient when it comes to meals, eating freshly caught barramundi and mud crabs and growing lettuce, tomatoes, carrots and sweet potatoes in their garden. They draw their own water from a borehole and use solar panels for most of their electricity. Development is quite restricted because much of the land is reserved for natives. As a result, the average lot costs $305,000, and building costs run around $240 a square foot, says Tony Hutchinson,
managing director of Hutchinson Real Estate in Broome. That doesn't include installing a solar-power system, drilling a borehole and transporting building materials. Note: Be prepared to visit Broome once a week to pick up mail, because the residents voted against mail delivery. "It's such a social thing," Mr. Hodgson says. "Everybody meets up at the post office." Enlarge Image
MAINE: Bruce Porter's aluminum-clad home on 1 acre is located on a small island in the Gulf of Maine and cost about $225,000 to build.
Eirik Johnson Coastal Islands Of Maine Isle au Haut Snapshot Population of Isle au Haut: 73 Population of Matinicus Isle: 74 Infrastructure: On Isle au Haut, there's a town dock, island store and community center. Electricity comes through a submarine cable and there's one loop road, a third of which is paved. Water is drilled or dug from wells, and oil is used to heat 85% of year-round island homes. Enlarge Image
Michael Newhouse Maine is home to more than 4,000 islands that offer both scenery and serenity. Two options with unspoiled territory are Isle au Haut, a 6-mile-long island that's a 45-minute boat ride from the mainland, and Matinicus Isle, which is about two hours away. The scenery and remoteness spurred Bruce Porter, a retired Columbia University journalism professor, to build a modest, $225,000 vacation home on another small island nearby. (The family didn't want to identify the island to keep it as undiscovered as possible.) Unlike Isle au Haut and Matinicus, Mr. Porter's island has no plumbing, power lines or paved roads. His daughter, Manhattan architect Alex Scott Porter, designed an aluminum-clad home with solar panels, a composting toilet and a gravity-driven cistern for the 1-acre property. "It needed to be self-sufficient," Ms. Porter says of the home. The family also installed a solar-powered refrigerator, a propane-fueled stove and an outdoor shower. They spend their days cooking with the wild rhubarb that grows outside the cabin, swimming in wetsuits off the rocky shore, collecting beach glass and watching sunsets. Shipping the building materials to the island proved to be a challenge, costing $2,500 for an amphibious boat to transport lumber and other items. Currently, there are 15 islands that are habitable year-round and a number of private summer retreats where people can develop, according to the Island Institute, an organization that focuses on islands in the Gulf of Maine.

MALAYSIA: A view of the water on Langkawi Island.
Langkawi, Malaysia Langkawi Snapshot Population of Langkawi: 64,792 Foreign eligibility: Foreigners can purchase land or homes so long as they spend a minimum of 500,000 ringgit, or about $160,684. For information on navigating the rules of Malay land, contact a real-estate agent in Malaysia. Infrastructure: Locals say phone calls that last more than 20 minutes are iffy, as service frequently gets cut off. But the road system is in fairly good shape, as are electricity, water and sewage services. Enlarge Image
Michael Newhouse Langkawi, an archipelago of Malaysian islands in the Andaman Sea, is the most inhabited of our picks, attracting yachters and an increasing number of tourists. But local real-estate agents and homeowners say parts of Langkawi still offer seclusion among the rain-forest-like hillsides. Malaysia is also one of the few Asian countries where foreigners can pay for land and build on it, says Shirley-Ann Joseph, a real-estate agent at Zerin Properties in Kuala Lumpur—though restrictions on some land may require foreigners to get creative about finding ways to build. "In America and the U.K., it's black and white," says Nicholas Holt,
research director at Knight Frank Asia Pacific, of laws concerning land ownership. "But here there's a lot of gray." Finding a lot can be a challenge. It took Gavin Welman,
U.K.-born chairman of an investment-holding company in Singapore, three years to find a suitable plot of land with a clear title. Then, because the lot was on Malay Reserve land, he needed to ask the Malay owner to enter an agreement in which he could use the land and build on it, but not own it. On the plot, he built a 5,800-square-foot home, where he enjoys yachting, dining at local restaurants and listening to tropical birds, such as hornbills, kingfishers and drongos. Once Mr. Welman secured land and found a suitable architect (which took another year), he was able to build three separate three-bedroom, two-bathroom homes for about $2 million in all. Labor cost him about $17 a day, and materials, he estimates, cost about $150 a square foot because some of the luxury finishes he chose required shipment from abroad. One of those homes is now for sale for about $1 million. These days, his biggest challenge, he says, is dealing with the incursions of nature: He enjoys watching his cat catch lizards that often scamper into his home. Enlarge Image
ECUADOR: Along the northern coast, the Jama Campay development offers 125 lots for between $5 and $20 a square foot. Francisco del Castillo The Northern Coast of Ecuador Away from the hubbub of the Galápagos Islands, a lone road snakes up the northern coast of Ecuador from the small town of Jama to the northern post of Cojimies. The area boasts the best of land and sea: white-sand beaches, quaint fishing villages and whale-watching opportunities. Minutes away are lush dry tropical forests that are home to vibrant orchids, lizards and frogs, howler monkeys and big waterfalls. Enlarge Image
One of the existing homes in the development is shown.
Francisco del Castillo Cojimies Snapshot Population of Cojimies: 15,000 Foreign eligibility: U.S. citizens don't need to be residents to purchase property. Infrastructure: Finding good water in Jama requires digging a well, and electricity there is "very bad" according to locals, who say residents should install backup generators. Most roads are made of dirt or sand and are vulnerable to flooding. Enlarge Image
Michael Newhouse In 2010, a new bridge was built over the Chone River, which cut down the time it takes to travel to the white-sand beaches here. Still, "it takes three hours to get to a grocery that resembles an American one," says Gary Phillips,
an Ecuadorean real-estate agent. Real estate is a word-of-mouth business in Ecuador. There is no multiple-listing service, and many parcels are for sale by owner and not readily advertised. Developers own many of the available lots along the beach, while land on the other side of E-15, the main road, primarily belongs to families. Buying family-owned land may involve multiple negotiations, since acreage may be co-owned by numerous relatives. As a result, Mr. Phillips says transactions can take eight to nine months to complete. Alternatively, local developers can sell small parcels of land in areas that are still relatively unpopulated. Francisco del Castillo,
for example, is offering 125 lots ranging from 1/3 of an acre to more than 5 acres for between $5 and $10 a square foot, depending on location. Building costs range between $65 and $85 per square foot, meaning a 4,000-square-foot home could cost as little as $260,000, not including the price of the land.

Swansea City's Miguel Michu, middle, and teammate Jonathan de Guzman, right.
Press Association The League Cup may be the first piece of silverware on the English soccer calendar every year but, in recent years, it came and went before many fans fully realized it was even going on. The biggest clubs use it to give their stars some rest. Most of the games are played on midweek evenings in the middle of winter. Besides, England has another knockout competition, the FA Cup, with more teams and at least an extra 70 years' worth of tradition. The League Cup's image problem became so bad—much like the National Invitation Tournament in U.S. college basketball or the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup in European soccer—that many wondered why it was still around at all. But this season has seen the League Cup rejuvenated, with a string of memorable games and notorious incidents. And on Sunday, it won't culminate with an expected battle between two of English soccer's behemoths, but rather a pair of Cinderellas: the Premier League's Swansea City and Bradford, a club from the fourth tier of English soccer. "It is fantastic when it's [Manchester] United-Arsenal or Liverpool-Man United, but there's many different layers to this," Richard Heaselgrove,
the Football League's chief commercial officer said in a telephone interview this week. "We think it's a richer story this year." Enlarge Image
Bradford City's Nahki Wells, left.
Press Association On the positive side, there was, for instance, the rugby-style score in Arsenal's 7-5 victory over Reading, or Bradford's semifinal upset of the Premier League's Aston Villa. Less flattering to the tournament—though just as talked about—was the semifinal fracas when Chelsea's Eden Hazard kicked a Swansea ball boy who was wasting time for the home side late in a game. Heaselgrove also chalked up the added attention to the energy of the cup's new sponsor, the U.S.-based credit-card issuer, Capital One.

The company has made a serious push to increase fans' engagement this season, most recently offering to supply each team with 21 free buses for fans to travel from their club's home city to Wembley on Sunday. From a sponsorship perspective, the League Cup hasn't always been the most glamorous property in English sports. But since the early 1980s the league has offered suitors the actual name of the competition rather than a role as a presenting partner. It is a subtle difference from, say, the Barclays Premier League, which is generally referred to simply as the Premier League. (Many people even continue to refer to it as the Premiership, a name first used by previous sponsors and out of circulation since 2007.) In 1982, for instance, the tournament's main sponsor was the British Milk Marketing Board and it became the Milk Cup. Thirty years and six sponsors later, Capital One stepped in. According to Sally Camm,
Capital One's head of brand communications, it was a "lucky coincidence" that the company was exploring sponsorship in the U.K. right around the time the Football League's deal with Carling, a beer brand, was coming to an end. But even Capital One could not have hoped for such an unlikely climax to the tournament. As Swansea manager Michael Laudrup
put it this week, this match up pits a "small fairy tale against the big fairy tale." Which team is which can be debated. It all depends on how far back you look for the beginning of those fairy tales. Once upon a time, Swansea was on the verge of being relegated from the fully professional ranks and flirting with financial insolvency. Then, helped by a succession of savvy managers and thrifty signings, it climbed up four divisions into the Premier League, playing stylish soccer along the way. Now one of British soccer's favorite success stories, it sits eighth in the top flight. Of course, Swansea is still some distance from competing for a Champions League spot or hovering around the top of the Premier League, but picking up a trophy on Sunday would represent real validation for its decadelong project. Bradford's fortunes over the same span have spun in the opposite direction. As recently as 2001, the Bantams were a Premier League outfit. But, dogged by constant financial woes, the club fell precipitously into League Two, the fourth tier of English soccer, where it languishes in midtable. So while Swansea's run this year fits into a larger narrative of incremental progress, Bradford's truly came out of the blue. The club seemed set for elimination at every turn—particularly when it faced a nearly full-strength Arsenal side—but continued to defy the conventional wisdom. "In Spain, that rarely happens," Swansea's Spanish striker Miguel Michu
told the club's website. "For a fourth-tier team to get to the final in Spain? Well, that's impossible. But in England it can happen." With the biggest clubs more likely to drop out early, it's also a rare chance for teams that can't otherwise contend to get close to some silverware—and the possibility of European competition the following season. In case that wasn't incentive enough, the Football League made sure to guarantee a minimum level of commitment from the 72 non-Premier League sides: under a new regulation, they must field at least six players who played in the team's previous game, regardless of the competition. Next season, the Football League will add fines for those who don't comply. "Unless you're City, United, maybe Chelsea, then this is a vital thing to win," Heaselgrove said. "And as long as it's a vital thing to win, then you've got interest—you've got television interest, you've got fan interest. I don't even question its relevance anymore."

Bill Gross is beating himself up—in more ways than one. In the monthly investment outlook he released this past week, the co-founder of Pimco, who oversees $2 trillion in investments, asked: "Am I a great investor?" His answer: "No, not yet"—because, he wrote, he hasn't been tested in a period unfavorable to bond...
