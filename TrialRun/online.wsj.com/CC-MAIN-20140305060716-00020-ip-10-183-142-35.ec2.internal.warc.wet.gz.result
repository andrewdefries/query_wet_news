Believe it or not, I still prefer watching television on a 60" screen, not a 6" screen.

Ditto. But I don't have any such devices anyway, since I am retired. I used to have an Archos that I downloaded videos onto manually, and traveled with that; but I don't travel all that much anymore either. I literally spent a lifetime putting together the "perfect" home theater system; and I don't expect I will ever want a pocket version.

A person who walks around town watching TV on some tiny hand held device is truly addicted. There's no substitute for sitting in a nice living room chair, watching a big flat screen with a wife, a beer and Agent Gibbs blowing away terrorists.

CK,Is that ME; as in Middle East? Do they have meStuff over there? I wonder what watching a war is like on a 6" screen. Is there an app for flying a drone with an iPhone? These are important questions for our times.

I think every American should have a iPhone that can control drones. Of course, this may make neighborhood disputes messier, but hey, the Second Amendment shouldn't have limits in this great country. I think I just came up with a plot for a future South Park episode.

CK,I like it. Do you think the SP boys are just another couple WSJ trolls like us, and will pick up on that? Wouldn't that be an interesting feedback loop. Here's a potential title: Drones vs droning; wherein many of the country's problems are solved.

Anyone who wants to watch movies on a tiny screen just doesn't understand the idea behind having your entire field of view filled with the movie so that you become engaged. We still go to the movies to get that experience with the best movies. We do watch movies on TV but it is widescreen HD!

I watch less and less TV, but when I do watch its on a large screen. Netflix is available through the TIVO - if I wanted to actually watch something. The real question is how much longer people will pay for premium services that ... repeat the same film over and over ... repeat the same film over and over.... Even with their on-demand services its was the same mindless, predictable, shallow, formula-like, tripe that is shown on a schedule - but on demand!!!

No, I am not watching more TV because I have a mobile device everywhere with me. No device will change my behavior about the TV or the movies. From my perspective, the new digital tablets are tools that can improve my way to compute data, access to Internet, or read the news. Never I will expend more time than before with my new tablet for watching TV. Domingo A. Trassens

When the iPad came out, I thought that newspapers will "die". One year later, I'm not sure. While I wouldn't be happy to watch a whole movie on it (except when flying abroad) I find it fantastic to watch the news with apps that allow me to pick which story I want to watch from each network and not be bombarded with an hour of "news" I don't consider news.Today, I tend to believe that, newspapers, magazines and TV, can all benefit form tablets.Chris Dascalopoulos, editor in chief of UDriver Automotive Magazine for the iPad

If Australia is open for business, not everything in the shop is for sale. Treasurer Joe Hockey's surprise decision to veto Archer Daniels Midland's 3 billion Australian dollar (US$2.7 billion) bid for GrainCorp Friday pokes holes in the freshly elected government's commitment to welcome foreign investment. After his center-right coalition won a landslide victory in September, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott pledged that...

IBM Reports Another Decline in Revenue
Tech Company Continues to Struggle with Hardware Sales, Emerging Markets
By
Spencer E. Ante
Updated Oct. 16, 2013 7:17 p.m. ET
International Business Machines Corp. posted a sixth straight quarterly decline in revenue on Wednesday, with disappointing results in several areas, including international business, technology services and hardware. IBM remains a large, profitable provider of computer hardware, software and services to big corporations and governments around the world. Its third-quarter profit rose 6%, but some of that was from a tax benefit. The Armonk, N.Y., company faces new competitors that rent out computing services and software...

New York The first time Lorraine Gordon entered the Village Vanguard, in the late 1930s, she was nearly thrown out. It's not that she was behaving improperly; she was just too young to be legally allowed into a bar. The first words she ever heard uttered by her future husband of 40 years, Max Gordon,
were "Get rid of those kids!"—meaning her and her brother. No one could have known then that, less than 15 years later, she would become an integral part of the Vanguard's history when she married Gordon, or that, in 1989, she would take over the club herself and keep it running to this day. Another major event no one could have foreseen 75 years ago: On the eve of her 90th birthday, Ms. Gordon would receive word that she is to become the first woman to receive the NEA Jazz Masters Award for Jazz Advocacy. Lorraine Gordon will be the first woman to receive the NEA Jazz Masters Award for Jazz Advocacy.
Ken Fallin A Tuesday afternoon at the Village Vanguard is a funny time to be talking about the past—despite being filled with pictures of jazz greats who played and recorded there in the 1950s and '60s (
Miles Davis,
John Coltrane, Bill Evans,
Sonny Rollins
), the club is thoroughly steeped in the present. Ms. Gordon is trying to talk in spite of persistent interruptions: delivery men requiring her to sign this or that; the piano tuner trying to work while the interview is proceeding; veteran drummer Andrew Cyrille
needing help to get his trap kit down the stairs; and tenor saxophonist Bill McHenry
getting ready for his soundcheck. Ms. Gordon, née Stein, was born in Newark, N.J., on Oct. 15, 1922, and has been a devoted jazz fan and a tireless advocate of the music her entire life. She and her brother Philip began listening to and collecting jazz records partly because they weren't allowed into the clubs where the music was played. Around 1935, the same year that Max Gordon opened the Vanguard, young Lorraine, inspired by developments in Paris, formed a loose collective of fans she named "The Hot Club of Newark." When not pursuing the music, she was studying visual arts. (Ten years or so later, she worked as an artist's model, but she concedes that her career in that area was limited because she was too modest to pose completely nude.) Ms. Gordon fidgets with her hearing aid—ultimately she removes it, announcing she hears better without it—and recalls that one of the first occasions she was legally allowed to hear a set all the way through was when she was 17 and Leadbelly was performing. "Oh my, I was so crazy about Leadbelly. I sat right back there," she says, indicating a table near the back of the room, "and Leadbelly came and sat with me. I wanted to draw him. My God. That fantastic head, that face, that white hair, those cheekbones. At that time I was trying to be an artist. I had art ambitions because I could draw. I sat there at that table with him; I probably just stared at him." Music was always part of her personal as well as professional life: Both of her husbands were major jazz advocates. In 1942, she married Alfred Lion,
the German refugee who was already the founder of Blue Note Records, which became the most important of all jazz labels. It was while she was trying to round up gigs for Blue Note artist Thelonious Monk,
who was then regarded as an uncommercial, avant-garde pianist who had a hard time finding work, that Lorraine became reacquainted with the Vanguard's Max Gordon. The first engagement by Monk at the Vanguard was a near disaster—no one was there ("You trying to ruin my business? We're dying with this guy!" Gordon bellowed). But Lorraine's relationship with Max blossomed. After her divorce from Lion, she married Gordon in 1950 and their daughter Rebecca was born later that year; their daughter Deborah, in 1952. In the beginning, the Vanguard featured a wide variety of acts: folk and blues singers, poets and comedians, as well as jazz. From 1943 to 1964, the Gordons also ran The Blue Angel, a club primarily for singers. By 1955, the Vanguard had shifted to an all-jazz policy; it's still the oldest continuously operated jazz club in the world. Ms. Gordon spent much of the 1960s as an antiwar activist: She was protesting involvement in Vietnam well before most Americans had even heard of Vietnam. When Max Gordon died in 1989, many assumed the Vanguard would shut down, but Ms. Gordon closed it for exactly one day in his memory, which she has continued to honor by maintaining the Vanguard's status as one of the top jazz venues in the world. She admits that the music has changed in the 75-plus years that she's been listening, and she feels that's a good thing: "Everything changes. Look at me, look at you. Of course it changes—it's a growing art form. Anything that's artistic and pure will change. Otherwise it's a static thing that you don't care about. What's new is the name of the game; if it comes out of the musical ability of artists who play and compose, then it's a valid art form." But Ms. Gordon does insist on some traditional values. "I encourage everyone who plays here to include at least one standard or ballad in every set—I say, no one's going out the door humming that original you wrote 10 minutes ago." In the past 23 years, the Vanguard has steadily featured regular acts, like pianists Bill Charlap and Fred Hersch,
whom longtime patrons expect to see. But Ms. Gordon is also willing to take a chance on new talent she has faith in, like Fabian Almazan,
the 27-year-old Cuban keyboardist and refugee who made his leader debut at the Vanguard in 2011. "Look, I have to keep finding new talent," she says, "but I'm not the only club in town. Sometimes I say, 'Go play somewhere else, let them break you in. I'll keep listening, and, when I hear that you're ready, you can come here.'" In 2005, Ms. Gordon published her memoir, "Alive at the Village Vanguard" (written with Barry Singer
). She says that the NEA award was totally unexpected. "It was completely out of the blue. They called me here at the club. A very nice man's voice asked for me. I said, 'Yes, this is she,' and he said, 'This is National Endowment for the Arts.' The first thing I said was, 'Well, how much money do you want?' He laughed, he told me about the award; I couldn't quite grasp it, I asked 'Why?' I was stunned—and still am." Does she have any thoughts about the award and the ceremony, which will be held at Jazz at Lincoln Center on Jan. 14? "Yes, I do. What am I going to wear?" Mr. Friedwald writes about jazz for the Journal. Email

Jeff Bennett
Jan. 8, 2013 11:23 p.m. ET
This is the year the world finds out whether General Motors Co. truly has been reborn. Its court-restructuring is receding in the rearview mirror, the easy profits from deep cuts in people, factories and a clean debt slate are giving way to a new set of challenges—an unevenly expanding industry with powerful rivals. GM now must show it has reconnected with American consumers who are the auto industry's greatest hope for steady gains...

Battle Lines Drawn on Budget
Republicans Say Further Tax Increases Off the Table for Coming Debt Negotiations
By
Siobhan Gorman And Peter Nicholas Jan. 6, 2013 11:07 a.m. ET
WASHINGTON—Republicans won't accept further tax increases in coming budget and debt negotiations, the party's Senate leader said Sunday, putting GOP lawmakers on a collision course with Democrats over raising the government's borrowing limit. Congress and President Barack Obama last week raised income-tax rates on high earners as part of legislation to avoid the series of spending cuts and broad tax increases known as the fiscal...

WASHINGTON—The Senate early Saturday passed its first formal budget in four years, defining Democrats' fiscal principles for the next, uncertain stage of Washington's battle over debt, spending and taxes. Enlarge Image
The setting sun is reflected in the windows of the U.S. Capitol, on Capitol Hill, Friday.
Alex Brandon/Associated Press More on the Senate Budget Budget Targets Fannie, Freddie Fees Seib & Wessel: Fiscal Drama The Democratic-drafted budget, approved narrowly a couple hours before dawn, calls for almost $1 trillion in new taxes over the next decade to help reduce the deficit. Although the budget is nonbinding and isn't likely to become law, it fleshes out Democrats' vision of a plan to reduce the deficit while protecting safety-net programs. The Senate passed the budget 50-49, largely along party lines. "The solution to our fiscal challenges will not be found in deep cuts to programs that vulnerable families depend on," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D., Wash.) as she closed debate on the blueprint. Republicans said the plan did too little to reduce the deficit, especially compared with House Republicans' plan to balance the budget in 10 years. "Honest people can disagree on policy, but there can be no disagreement on the need to change our debt course," said Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee. "The House budget changes our debt course, while the Senate budget does not." The Senate approved the budget after voting on a slew of amendments stretched through the night. Among them, the Senate Friday adopted an amendment aimed at giving states more authority to collect sales taxes from out-of-state Internet retailers. The budget plan was opposed by four Democrats who are up for re-election in 2014: Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), Kay Hagan (D., N.C.), Mark Pryor (D., Ark.) and Mark Begich (D., Alaska). All of the Senate's Republicans voted against the plan and Sen. Frank Lautenberg
(D., N.J.) didn't vote. Congress will be out of town for a two-week spring recess after three months of budget wrangling in which Congress passed a major tax increase, raised the federal debt limit, allowed $85 billion in spending cuts to take effect and enacted a bill to keep the government operating through Sept. 30. But the end of that flurry of activity is just the beginning of the next, more amorphous phase of budgeting. It isn't clear whether or how Democrats can bridge the vast differences between their Senate budget and the version passed by the Republican-controlled House Thursday. The GOP budget enshrines conservative fiscal principles that are anathema to Democrats, raising no taxes and making substantial cuts in Medicare and other safety-net programs. It is unlikely that the differences will be resolved in textbook legislative fashion—through a House-Senate conference committee to negotiate a compromise. Instead, lawmakers predict any big budget deal would emerge from high-level negotiations with the White House. President Barack Obama
has tried to reach out to Republicans who might be willing to work with him on a deficit-reduction deal that includes both tax increases and spending cuts. So far, nothing concrete has come of those efforts. But members of both parties said that passage of the two budgets was a precondition to further progress, allowing both parties to speak to their political base before talking further with each other. "No budget is going to be perfect for everyone, but this is a credible, important first step in the process," said Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), a Senate Budget Committee member who has supported deeper spending cuts in bipartisan deals. "I look forward to moving to the next stage." The next pressure point comes this spring and summer, when Congress will have to raise the federal debt limit or else let the U.S. Treasury run out of cash to pay its bills. House Republicans say they won't approve any debt increase unless it is paired with matching budget cuts. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) has said his party's lawmakers will meet immediately after Congress returns in April to begin discussing what their price will be for raising the debt limit. However, Mr. Obama has said he won't negotiate over that must-pass measure, and Republicans have been gun-shy about reviving their past strategy of threatening to delay a debt-limit increase to get their way. Whenever or however a deal takes shape, the big questions are whether Mr. Obama is able to offer cuts in Medicare and other entitlement programs that are drastic enough to open the way for Republicans to compromise on taxes. And if so, whether there are enough Republicans open to including tax increases to build a majority without GOP leaders who are adamantly opposed. The budget debate in the Senate laid bare the deep partisan divisions over numerous issues. Many amendments were rejected along strict party lines and were of little consequence because the entire budget is a nonbinding measure and destined not to become law. Buried in the partisan onslaught, however, are two important tax proposals that came to test votes in the Senate for the first time. The first, passed Thursday, called for repealing a tax on medical devices that is part of Mr. Obama's health-care law; it passed by a wide bipartisan margin with support from many Democrats whose states are home to big device manufacturers. The Senate approved an amendment that called for making it easier for states to collect sales tax from online retail sales. The measure opened divisions within both parties: Senators representing states that have sales taxes supported the amendment, while those from states that don't allied with online retailers in opposition to it.

Back to the beginning
Looking for something different from their high-rise apartment in New York's Olympic Tower, Shirley and Walter Gasner decided to build a home in the little-known town of New Shoreham on Rhode Island's Block Island in the mid-1970s. The couple died in 2012, but their family, some of whom still live on the tiny island, are selling the home as part of an estate sale. Mr. Gasner can be seen waving at the camera in this aerial shot taken around 2000. John Gasner

A current photograph of the home is shown. The roughly 1,600-square-foot house was completed around 1979 by one of the couple's sons, John Gasner, 65 years old. Mr. Ganser said he designed a home for his parents that took advantage of the broad views of the surrounding body of water, Harbor Pond. Christopher Garrison/Garrison Design

Located about 12 miles from the Rhode Island coastline with a year-round population just over 1,000, the tourism council calls the island 'the smallest town in the smallest state' in the U.S. The property is surrounded on three sides by water. The family would often get together to go kayaking or fishing on the pond. Sailing is also an option, as the ponds leads into the ocean. Christopher Garrison/Garrison Design

Unlike the home's traditional New England facade, the interior of the home is loft-like and airy. The decision was made, in part, because the open layout allowed for the most natural light and vistas. Mrs. Gasner was also a fan of modern Danish furniture, which contributed to the contemporary aesthetic, said her son Mr. Gasner. Christopher Garrison/Garrison Design

Mr. Gasner was a physician and Mrs. Ganser was a homemaker, according to their granddaughter, Hannah Garrison. The late couple's four children have decided to put the house on the market in an estate sale. Christopher Garrison/Garrison Design

'They wanted something very simple and very clean,' said Mr. Gasner. One of the interesting features of the home is the lack of doors in the home. 'They wanted it to be this very modern, very open floor plan,' he said. Christopher Garrison/Garrison Design

To create discrete spaces in the home without the use of doors, Mr. Gasner designed a curved hallway which leads to the home's only bedroom. Christopher Garrison/Garrison Design

The bedroom features several windows that look out on the grounds. In total there is one bedroom and 1½ bathrooms, though there is space for an additional bedroom. Christopher Garrison/Garrison Design

A bathroom located off the master bedroom features a large opening that looks through the bedroom and out onto the views outside. In lieu of doors, there are adjustable screens on the bathrooms and bedroom that can be lowered when guests are visiting. Christopher Garrison/Garrison Design

Ms. Garrison, the couple's granddaughter, says some of her first memories are of spending lazy days on the property. 'The earliest pictures I have of myself are of me sitting on the front porch, at seven or eight months old, eating a cucumber from the garden,' she said. Ms. Garrison's grandparents tended a vegetable and flower garden on the property, which is still in use. Christopher Garrison/Garrison Design

There are three outbuildings on the property that were also built in the 1970s. Mr. Gasner, who also lives on the island, said they've been used for everything from storage to workshops, and, at one point, as a kite shop. 'It's a wonderful little compound,' he said.

The family listed home in May without a listing agent. They are asking for $3.25 million. The home is located at 1071 Beach Ave. on Block Island. Adjacent parcels of land are also for sale, according to Mr. Gasner. Christopher Garrison/Garrison Design
