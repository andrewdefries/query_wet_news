Comment: It's easy to be derisive in a Portlandia style world. But no one, Mr. Kessler, prevented you from enjoying your greasy chicken. And frankly it's a bit puerile on your part to complain about people who give some thought to the environmental destruction that has been reaped upon this land.

Comment: The key phrase in this piece: "The medically uninsurable...."Mr. Jenkins is, in the end, concerned that we would have a true system of shared risk in this society. A system in which everyone has access to care even if they can't afford it. He would focus all his protection on those who are losing bad policies with lame coverage. He does nothing for people who need help. They're on their own....er....I mean they're medically uninsurable. So good riddance to them.

Opinion: A GOP Shutdown Strategy
(155 days ago)
Comment: Your chronic insistence on looking at Obama as weak (in this case "AWOL") is myopic. Obama has learned something after almost 5 years in office: when you have the cards, hold them. He's not AWOL. He's just not going to put up with nonsense. He came into office in 2009 promising change. He changed things, and the ACA was one of those changes. Now it's taking effect. Obama is not absent--he's actually quite "present."

Do you believe lawmakers will settle on budget cuts and taxes before we hit the "fiscal cliff?"
Most economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal don't expect harsh spending cuts to take effect in January. They put the odds at less than 20% that a standoff among lawmakers would trigger all the spending reductions and expiration of tax cuts. Most anticipate a temporary agreement that just kicks the can down the road for a few months. But uncertainty over the "fiscal cliff" looms over hopes for growth in the U.S. economy this fall. Do you think we'll hit the cliff? Created by WSJ Editor

If Obama wins re-election, he'll let the "Bush tax cuts" expire, and then subsequently begin negotiations with the Republicans. Exactly what'll come out of those negotiations is hard to say. But I think that, from Obama's point of view, another recession is a worthwhile price to pay for raising taxes on the evil rich.

When I win, we will not hit the cliff. I will get enough weak willy er Blue Dog Donks in the Senate to cave to at least get the military budget increased. Then I start issuing executive orders on the tax side. With the Supremes in my pocket, they'll all be upheld, and I'll make a ton of money for the producer-class, tax free. Watch me.
Remember: one term for the Kenyan! GOP/capital-strike, just like in Atlas Shrugged.

Answered---No. However, they will ensure a "Softer Landing" than is being hyped for negotiating purposes. Remember--Just because they Passed Legislation and the President Signed It---Neither side will feel constrained to follow what they have written as if it were a "Law."

I hope that I am wrong, but I am afraid that from now to January, the lawmakers will not settle on budget cuts and taxes because after the high pressure these elections generated in Washington, more than one continue dizzy... However, they have to do!!!

Republicans want to save Bush tax cuts & defense industry expenditures. So they will agree but will demand that the poorest of the poor shed some blood for Republican Tea Party.

The democrats demand more taxes. They will go to the extreme to get them. Blaming the republicans for not helping, that is a given. If the republicans cave or block I think that they will loose the House in 2 years. So the democrats get the taxes and most likely the house. The republicans are in a true no win spot. So why not just go along with the democrats over the top spending & taxing plan to show how cooperative republicans can be. The democrats will clearly own the fiscal train wreck, it will be pain full but then the republicans may have a much better shot at picking up the peaces not tared by the accusation of obstruction politics. No pain no change.

It is time to stop the Republican propaganda machine. The Government, as measure by Government employees to general population ratio is the smallest in last 70 years. We can cut taxes on the rich, stop taking care of the infrastructure, keep on increasing the difference between the richest and the poorest, but it will come at a very high cost. We will become a third world nation. Look at any poor nation. The poor are really poor but the rich are filthy rich. There is no infrastructure. Govt employees are poor and take bribes openly to survive. Crime is high. Is that what you want in this country? Those of the consequences of when rich don't want to pay to maintain infrastructure and a healthy society. We can see the consequences of colonial era in third world countries. We have seen the results of feudalism. We have seen the results of gilded age. Do you really want that to come back where rich lived in huge mansions in town like Newport, Rhode Island, and the poor hunted for food. Please look at our own history and the world history and work towards a balanced educated society and not a society where the rich are extreme rich and the poor are extreme poor.

New York The confusion of purpose commingling commerce and commemoration at the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan and a brewing controversy over architect Frank Gehry's approach to a Dwight D. Eisenhower
memorial in Washington suggest that the art of memorializing has been lost. That makes the sublime modern monumentality of the Four Freedoms Park dedicated to Franklin D. Roosevelt,
which opens on Roosevelt Island on Wednesday, all the more impressive. The design by Louis Kahn
(1901-1974), for many the most eminent American architect of the 20th century, took nearly 40 years to realize, and so in a sense it has already withstood the test of time. Enlarge Image
The Four Freedoms Park dedicated to Franklin D. Roosevelt—the only work in New York City designed by Louis Kahn—opens Wednesday.
Amiaga Commissioned in 1973 but shelved for several decades, the Four Freedoms Park is the first memorial in the city to FDR, who governed the state from 1929 to 1933, and the only work in the city by Kahn. By dint of its extreme location on the southern tip of Roosevelt Island, a site barely accessible even to the island's 14,000 inhabitants, the four-acre park is already far removed from the rest of the city. Kahn, a master at constructing transcendence at such landmarks as the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., and the Phillips Exeter Library in New Hampshire, lifted the memorial spiritually out of space and time as well. On entering, the visitor immediately ascends a massive staircase, wider if not taller than those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is not possible to see what lies beyond—only sky—turning arrival into something enigmatic. All the tricks of ancient processional are brought into play. From the top of the stairs, the forced perspective of a trapezoidal lawn reinforced by symmetrical allées of Littleleaf Linden trees narrows down to one focal point, the granite block holding the larger-than-life bronze bust of FDR. Along the perimeter, rising ramps accentuate the elevated plane of the lawn, while colossal wedges of solid granite form an embankment emerging from the riprap at the water's edge. Simply approaching feels purposeful. The space behind the bust, which Kahn called the Room, is made of stone blocks, each 6 feet tall, 6 feet wide and 12 feet deep—bracketing the room to east and west but leaving the view down the river open to the south. The 36-ton blocks do not touch and were installed the way the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids, by tipping blocks into sand. This space of elemental simplicity open to sky and water forces even the most casual visitor to ponder fundamentals and perhaps to appreciate the weight that burdened Roosevelt as he considered taking America into a world war. An excerpt from his Four Freedoms speech is inscribed on one of the blocks and begins "In the future days which we seek to make secure . . . " Freed from any functional requirements, Kahn designed a purely contemplative and insistently solemn place achieving what the architectural historian Vincent Scully once described as Kahn's goal: "the primeval reality of architecture as physical mass." But Kahn himself was unsure how the park would work in an everyday sense, calling it a "space of inspired use," which he indicated in renderings with a violinist. How New Yorkers will now engage with this extraordinary public landscape poses some challenges. Foremost, it's not easy to get to Roosevelt Island. The aerial tram from Second Avenue and 59th Street only operates two gondolas at a time. The island can be reached from Manhattan on the F train, only three stops after Rockefeller Center, but according to a 2009 report on the island's infrastructure conducted by the department of urban affairs and planning at Hunter College, the subway was even then running at full capacity. There is a bridge from Queens at the north end of the island. Cars, buses and pedestrians can cross over, but then have to negotiate the island's easily congested Main Street, where one double-parked car can stop traffic. There is no visitor parking lot; nor are there rest rooms or, at the moment, even trash cans on site. In the next few years, half the island will become a vast construction site for Cornell Technion's new campus, clogging traffic and access even further for decades to come. Such barriers to easy approach may slow New Yorkers down, but not for long. The past few years in New York have seen an extraordinary enrichment of the public environment through the recovery of several abandoned and ignored spaces, and New Yorkers and tourists are embracing them in droves. More than two million people have visited the High Line, and its popularity with the attendant crowds has turned some in its Chelsea neighborhood against it. This summer, Governors Island, well on its way from dereliction to destination, was visited by 345,000 people in just 40 days. The Roosevelt Memorial expects about 150,000 visitors a year, but many think that is a gross underestimate. On dedication day last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that the Four Freedoms Park memorial would be a new state park, a wonderful boon. But who will operate and maintain the park has yet to be ironed out among the new Four Freedoms Park Conservancy, the overburdened state park system and the often fractious Roosevelt Island Operating Corp. Kahn created a memorial of enduring value; hopefully, attention will now be paid to safeguarding that vision for a future of active use. Ms. Iovine writes about architecture for the Journal. Email

'Co-Co' Debt Finds Favor in Euro Zone
Spanish, Portuguese Governments See Debt as Tool to Aid Lenders, Without Direct Bailouts
By
Sara Schaefer Muñoz And Patricia Kowsmann February 13, 2012
A new breed of bank debt that turns into equity if a lender hits trouble is becoming the instrument of choice for some Southern European governments as they prop up their ailing banks. The instruments, known as "contingent convertibles," began to get attention following the financial crisis and have been issued by a few banks. "Co-cos," as they are called, are sold as interest-bearing debt that has to be paid back....
