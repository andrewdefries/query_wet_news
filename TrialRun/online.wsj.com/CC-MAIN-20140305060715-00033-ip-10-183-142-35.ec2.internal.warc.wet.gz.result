Business & Finance French auto maker Renault is considering Carlos Tavares, the head of Nissan's Americas unit, as a leading candidate to become deputy to CEO Carlos Ghosn. Russia's energy minister doesn't expect BP and Rosneft to be able to revive their alliance in its current form after it was blocked by BP's existing Russian partners, but he said the two oil companies are still talking. Ryanair posted a 23% increase in fiscal-year net profit but warned that higher fuel prices will force it to ground dozens of aircraft this winter, including nearly all of its 50 new Boeing planes. Shell has been rapped by Norway's Petroleum Safety Authority for a maintenance error on an oil well that had "major accident potential" and risked an oil leak. Sony warned it expects to post an annual loss of $3.2 billion, reversing a previous prediction of a return to profitability, as the Japanese electronics giant struggles to recover from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Yandex might raise the price range for its U.S. IPO amid strong demand for shares of the Russian search-engine firm. EBay could use some of the $2.4 billion it will receive from the sale of its remaining 30% stake in Internet-phone provider Skype to make acquisitions and return money to investors through share buybacks, its CEO said. Hon Hai workshops that handle polishing for electronics products will remain shut pending an investigation into a deadly plant explosion in China last week. A U.S. senator is broadening a stock-trading probe into hedge-fund SAC Capital, with plans to examine options trading. *** World-Wide Greece will accelerate its long-delayed plans to sell off $70.7 billion of state-owned assets over the next five years, under pressure from Germany and other euro-zone members to reduce its massive debt burden. A U.K. parliamentary committee said it had found no evidence that hydraulic fracturing, the controversial process used to extract natural gas from dense shale rocks, poses any risk to water supplies and rejected calls for a moratorium on permits for shale-gas activity. President Obama arrived in Ireland to begin a weeklong European courtship, as he seeks to rekindle relations with a continent that has at times felt snubbed under his leadership. One of the lead candidates for the top IMF post is also one of the institution's strongest critics. Growth in the euro zone's private sector registered its sharpest monthly slowdown in 2½ years in May, with manufacturing expanding at its weakest rate in seven months, a survey showed. Belarus's central bank devalued the country's currency by 36% and said it will allow the ruble to be traded within a band of 12% above and below the average exchange rate of the currency basket, consisting of dollars, rubles and euro. Gunbattles erupted in Yemen's capital amid rising fears that the breakdown of negotiations for a peaceful transition of power could lead to civil war. Pawlenty entered the Republican presidential race and criticized Obama's leadership. Pakistani security forces ended a nightlong Taliban siege of an air base that left at least 10 dead. EU foreign ministers agreed to sanction an Iranian-owned bank based in Hamburg the U.S. says has been part of Iran's efforts to expand its nuclear program. The building of a facility to treat radioactive water is facing a delay, adding problems at Japan's Daiichi plant. Email

Disarray within the Ecuadorean government over the role of WikiLeaks' Julian Assange in Edward Snowden's asylum bid is complicating the outcome, according to diplomatic correspondence that appears to shed light on the mixed signals from Quito over the American fugitive's fate. Mr. Assange—the antisecrecy-group founder who for the past year has been sheltered inside Ecuador's London embassy—wrote to Ecuadorean officials Monday that he hoped his role in the Snowden matter hadn't embarrassed the government, according to an...
