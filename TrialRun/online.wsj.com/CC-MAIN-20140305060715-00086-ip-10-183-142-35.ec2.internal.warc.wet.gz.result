The Supreme Court's decisions Wednesday offered neither side in the debate over same-sex marriage a sweeping resolution. With the justices' ruling on the Proposition 8 gay-marriage ban concerning only California, the path forward nationally on the issue remains winding—and may eventually lead back to the Supreme Court. Both sides say they are gearing up for more battles in individual states until the courts or Congress intervenes...

The new Lajaward Swimming Complex here has drawn a growing following since it opened last year offering what is a novelty for all but a few Afghans—a pool, a menthol-scented steam room, full-body massages and the opportunity to imagine they aren't...

Lance Armstrong,
the former professional cyclist who was recently stripped of his seven Tour de France titles, has told his associates that he is weighing his options for making a public acknowledgment that he had doped during his cycling career, according to a person familiar with the matter. Enlarge Image
Lance Armstrong before the start of the ninth stage of the 90th Tour de France cycling race in July 2003.
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images His possible confession, if he goes forth with one, could enable Mr. Armstrong to begin the process of restoring his public reputation, which has been badly damaged in recent months. Last year, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency stripped Mr. Armstrong of his seven titles and any other honors he received between his comeback from life-threatening cancer in 1998 and his retirement from top-level competitive cycling in 2010.

Those options include going on television, writing a book or making a public statement of some sort in the near future about his own alleged use of performance enhancing drugs. It's also possible Mr. Armstrong might choose not to make a public statement. Tim Herman,
a lawyer for Mr. Armstrong, said that discussions with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency "aren't currently on the table," and added that "there has been no discussion" with the World Anti Doping Agency. Officials at the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency didn't respond to requests for comment. Timeline: Decades of Doping
View Graphics
A confession by Mr. Armstrong would complicate several legal matters related to his alleged doping. Those include a whistleblower lawsuit filed by his former teammate, Floyd Landis, in 2010. According to people familiar with the matter, the lawsuit alleges that Mr. Armstrong and other people associated with his former cycling team knowingly violated their sponsorship agreement with the United States Postal Service when they allegedly instituted an organized doping program on the team. The Postal Service was Mr. Armstrong's team sponsor during six of his seven Tour de France victories. Under the contract with the team, riders were prohibited from using performance-enhancing drugs. Further complicating matters is the fact that Mr. Armstrong denied doping for so long, and publicly attacked those who accused him over the years. Corrections & Amplifications The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency stripped cyclist Lance Armstrong of his seven titles and any other honors last year. Some versions of this article incorrectly said the action was taken earlier this year. Write to Vanessa O'Connell at vanessa.o'connell@wsj.com and Reed Albergotti at reed.albergotti@wsj.com Email

Citi's Earnings Disappointment Extends to CEO
By
Matthias Rieker
Updated Jan. 17, 2013 12:00 p.m. ET
Citigroup Inc.'s new chief executive, Michael Corbat, in his first quarterly earnings announcement, unveiled results that fell far short of forecasts and told investors to lower their expectations for the bank's return on assets. The bank's results were hit by a slew of charges—some expected, some unexpected. A surprise was Citi's $1.3 billion in legal charges, which included $1 billion in reserves for any potential regulatory action and other legal issues. Citi Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach revealed that a...

CAIRO—The Obama administration hopes to "pivot" away from a hyper-focus on the Middle East during its second term, but John Kerry's maiden overseas mission as secretary of state—a nine-nation odyssey across Europe and the Persian Gulf—highlighted why that goal may be elusive. Imminent threats posed by Syria's civil war and Iran's nuclear program, and longer-term challenges of Egypt's flagging economy and the moribund...

When the NFL draft kicks off Thursday, about nine million die-hard football fans go through all the preparations they do for a normal NFL Sunday, except instead of exhilarating football, they'll spend three hours watching NFL commissioner Roger Goodell read people's names before hugging them. We realize this is more exciting for some than others, so with that in mind we put together a guide for Thursday's draft that addresses many levels of engagement. Enlarge Image
Luke Joeckel (Texas A&M)
Cal Sport Media/Zuma Press THE BEGINNER: The annual draft is the one opportunity NFL teams get to cream the most promising talent from the ranks of college football. There are seven rounds, each with at least 32 picks. During the first round, which is being televised live (ESPN and NFL Network, 8 p.m.) every team has 10 minutes to choose. Do you love football but know next to nothing about the 2013 NFL Draft? Do you even know what the draft is? Here's a beginner's look at this year's NFL Draft from WSJ Sports.
In the most ruthlessly general terms: the benefits of making a good pick are huge. Some star players will spend their entire career with the team that drafted them (Ray Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens and Tom Brady of the New England Patriots come to mind). The trouble is that drafting players from college isn't an exact science: Even after combing through game film, putting players through grueling physical drills and conducting interviews, the odds aren't great. An average of just 8.1 players taken in the first round of the NFL draft between 1999 and 2009 were later selected to the Pro Bowl. A slightly higher number, 9.8 per year, had left the team that drafted them within four years. And in the same span, 35 teams had entire draft classes that vanished within five years. In a nutshell, this particular draft is considered "deep" in that it has a lot of pretty good players, but it's demonstrably short on stars—like last year's marquee picks, quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III. If you're curious at all, you'd be well served to stick around for the first pick, where something rather unusual is likely to happen. The player expected to take the stage first, and become a Kansas City Chief, is either Luke Joeckel of Texas A&M or Eric Fisher of Central Michigan—both tackles. Yes, that's one of those big nameless guys who plays on the offensive line. It would be the third time in 20 years a tackle has gone first. Enlarge Image
Tavon Austin (West Virginia)
Getty Images THE INTERMEDIATE: NFL teams often go one of two ways when picking players at the draft. Some like to acquire the best player available at any given moment. Others prefer to draft the best player available who also fills a gaping hole. Sometimes, the tension between these two motives can create significant drama. This year it doesn't really matter. Oddly, the needs of the teams with the first picks seem to align pretty seamlessly with the talent available. After Kansas City nabs its tackle, the Jacksonville Jaguars, who also need line help, can take whoever is left of Joeckel or Fisher. The Raiders, picking third, need help at every single position, so they'd be pleased with a lineman or linebacker Dion Jordan from Oregon. They might also be pleased with a plate of nachos. One group not expected to make noise: quarterbacks. Matt Barkley of Southern California was supposed to be a top pick—until a brutal senior season raised questions about his arm strength and decision-making. Geno Smith of West Virginia is considered the best athlete of the bunch, but the most intriguing quarterback in the draft, Michigan's Denard Robinson, is trying to catch on as a wide receiver—and should be a late-round pick. Enlarge Image
Matt Barkley (Southern California)
Getty Images THE ADVANCED: If there's anything one can say with certainty about the NFL draft it's that it's an event that rewards obsession. For those who actually know the offensive and defensive schemes employed by the teams, and also know the strengths and weaknesses of the draftees, the draft becomes a fascinating exercise in pressurized game theory. Do you follow the NFL religiously? Are you as excited about 7th Round draft picks as 1st Round picks? Then check out this 2013 NFL Draft preview for experts from WSJ Sports.
One of the geekiest subplots this year is whether former longtime Eagles coach Andy Reid, who is taking over as head coach in Kansas City, will actually use the first pick for a lineman (he's famous for ignoring just about everything but quarterbacks and wide receivers). Joeckel isn't a sure thing, either. Sure, he can block, but protecting Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel—who has a quick release and runs at the first sign of trouble—is dramatically different than protecting a pocket-passing NFL quarterback who throws on every play. Another subplot: the growing prevalence of the spread offense in the NFL, which will allow for small, speedy wide receivers like West Virginia's Tavon Austin to go from afterthought to a potential top-15 pick.
