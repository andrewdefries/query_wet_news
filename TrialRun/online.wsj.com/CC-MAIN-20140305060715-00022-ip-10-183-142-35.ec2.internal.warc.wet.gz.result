Property Investors Lie in Wait for China Slowdown
By
Esther Fung
April 10, 2012 1:20 p.m. ET
BEIJING—Cash-strapped Chinese property companies may face a reckoning this year amid high debts and a government campaign to bring down housing prices. If that happens, a number of outside investors are waiting to step in. Prompted in part by approaches from Chinese and Hong Kong property companies, French insurer AXA SA's real-estate arm is planning to make its first investment in China this year and hopes to invest €2 billion ($2.6 billion) in the market over the next five years, mainly in major cities such as Beijing...

Investors who want to participate in a nuclear-power revival, take note: It's not for the faint of heart. Journal Report Read the complete Energy report .
That's because the nuclear industry is subject to greater risks than other parts of the power sector. Nuclear plants are extremely costly and take years to build. Most new reactor designs are still awaiting certification by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and no utility in the U.S. has received the commission's permission to build and operate a new plant. On top of that, the entire power sector is suffering because of depressed demand for electricity caused by the global recession and growing energy-conservation efforts. Low natural-gas prices also mean that nuclear plants look more expensive when compared with plants powered by fossil fuels. Nevertheless, many investors believe nuclear power will make a comeback because reactors can produce huge amounts of electricity and could substitute for coal-powered plants, cutting pollution. Dozens of new plants are planned for South Korea, China, India, the U.K. and other nations. In the U.S., the Obama administration has proposed up to $54 billion in loan guarantees to jump-start new construction, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is processing applications for nearly two dozen proposed reactors. So, how should a bullish investor approach the industry? Here's what analysts have to say. Finding the Best As a broad approach, Laurence Alexander,
an analyst for investment bank Jefferies & Co. in New York, advises against "theme investing," or simply buying a basket of stocks engaged in the nuclear industry without taking the time to learn about individual companies. Instead, he advises clients to pick the best-positioned company in each market segment, such as the firm with the reactor design that is most likely to succeed, or the best engineering firm. Enlarge Image
Excavation is under way at the Vogtle nuclear site in Georgia, where Southern Co. plans to add two reactors.
Southern Company Investors looking for pure plays on the industry—companies whose profits, and therefore their share prices, depend solely on nuclear-related business—won't find much to choose from. Most companies in the nuclear industry get much of their revenue from non-nuclear business. One notable exception is France-based Areva SA,
which does everything from manufacture nuclear fuel to design and build reactors to reprocess radioactive waste. Currently, it's working with Northrop Grumman Corp.

to build a $360 million factory for reactor components in Newport News, Va., part of its effort to build up a U.S. supply chain to support the sale of its new reactor, the EPR. But there are plenty of companies not exclusively in the nuclear business that stand to benefit from increased spending on nuclear power over the next few years. They include companies that do engineering, procurement and construction for utilities. Most such firms have aligned themselves with a particular reactor design, so they will benefit most if those reactors get built in large numbers. Shaw Group Inc.,
based in Baton Rouge, La., has contracts to build 10 Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, the top pick of U.S. utilities so far. (Westinghouse is 77% owned by Japan's Toshiba Corp.

in Texas, another front-runner for federal loan guarantees. Support for Utilities What about utilities? Mr. Alexander, of Jefferies, advises picking ones whose projects have won regulatory support. Atlanta-based Southern, which wants to build two reactors at its existing Vogtle nuclear site in Georgia, recently garnered $3.4 billion in conditional loan guarantees from the Department of Energy. Although it is still negotiating final loan terms and awaiting NRC approval, the company appears confident: Site preparation began last year. Southern also has won favorable treatment from Georgia utility regulators, so that it should be able to recover its investment even if plants are started but not completed. The utility goes to regulators regularly, briefing them on expenditures, and is allowed to begin collecting money from customers to cover its costs. This is unusual; normally, utilities aren't allowed to collect money for projects until plants are put in service. Another plus is that some of Southern's equipment and services vendors have agreed to fixed-price terms instead of the variable "cost plus" contracts that were common in the past and often a problem. Still, says Dmitri Nikas,
an analyst for the Standard & Poor's Corp. credit-rating agency, nuclear projects in general risk "waning political or regulatory support caused by rising construction costs." Scana, which plans to build two Westinghouse reactors in South Carolina, has drawn praise from analysts for more extensive financial disclosure about its nuclear projects than Southern. Both make regular reports to state regulators, but Southern's public versions are much more heavily redacted than Scana's.

, which has a nuclear-services business called Babcock & Wilcox Co. Babcock furnishes the industry with nuclear fuel, services and equipment and is developing a small reactor that could be built in factories in the U.S. and then shipped to utilities by truck or rail. This should drive down costs and eliminate bottlenecks that could afflict big reactor vendors that rely on an international supply chain. McDermott, which also makes deep-sea drilling rigs, plans to split itself into two companies within the next year, giving investors an opportunity to bet on a pure nuclear play. UBS's Mr. Fisher, who has a buy recommendation on McDermott, says the new reactor business is "important for long-term diversification and growth," though he says it will cost money, without producing revenues, for the next few years. Probably the easiest way to invest is to put money in funds that own shares of nuclear-related stocks. One is the PowerShares Global Nuclear Energy Portfolio.
Another is the iShares S&P Global Nuclear Energy Index Fund.

Associated Press Updated Nov. 2, 2012 3:27 p.m. ET
ANN ARBOR, Mich.—The NHL has canceled the 2013 Winter Classic at Michigan Stadium. The signature event between the Detroit Red Wings and Toronto Maple Leafs is the latest casualty from the labor dispute that has put the season on hold, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Friday. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the league had not yet announced the move, said the NHL will schedule its next Winter Classic at the iconic stadium that seats more than 100,000 people. There have been no labor negotiations since Oct. 18, when the players' union countered a league offer with three proposals. Those were all quickly rejected by the NHL. Since then, a league-imposed deadline to play a full season has passed, and last week the NHL canceled all games through Nov. 30. Detroit and Toronto, two of the league's Original Six teams, were scheduled to play outdoors on Jan. 1 at the stadium known as the Big House and the league was hoping the matchup would break the world record for hockey attendance. Michigan and Michigan State's hockey teams drew a record 104,173 fans in 2010. Buffalo, Chicago, Boston, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia have all hosted the Winter Classic, but the crowd for a game at Michigan Stadium was expected to draw the league's largest crowd with tens of thousands of fans coming from Canada to see its first team play in the event. The last Classic at Philadelphia's Citizens Bank Park drew 46,967, and the New York Rangers beat the host Flyers 3-2. The labor dispute, which began Sept. 16, had already forced 326 games to be wiped out from Oct. 11 through Nov. 30, but losing the sixth annual outdoor extravaganza is the biggest blow yet for the league and its players. In the rental agreement between the NHL and the University of Michigan, there was a clause regarding a cancellation due to a work stoppage. If the game was called off by Friday, the NHL would lose only a $100,000 deposit that it already paid. The league would incur further losses, including paying back Michigan for expenses it made, if a decision to wipe out the game came after Friday. The NHL was to pay a total of $3 million—over multiple installments—to rent Michigan Stadium. A $250,000 payment was scheduled to be made Friday. The cancelation is a strong reality check that this fight between the league and the players' association has no end in sight. The sides have remained in contact in recent days, but none of those discussions have led to any new negotiations. NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly
and players' association special counsel Steve Fehr have spoken several times over the course of this week and seem to be moving closer to setting up a time to get together. Daly said that Superstorm Sandy didn't prevent the sides from returning to negotiations this week. "No meetings have been scheduled yet, but we have had an ongoing dialogue," Daly wrote in an email to The Associated Press on Friday. The NHL has already said that it will be impossible to play a full regular-season because of the lockout, and even if the league is able to reschedule some games that were previously called off, it seems unlikely that the Winter Classic can be moved to a new date or location this season. The league has said a deal needed to be completed by last week in order to have a full season, beginning on Nov. 2. It didn't happen. The All-Star game, and perhaps the entire season, could be next on the chopping block. In its most recent proposal, the NHL offered the union a 50-50 split of hockey-related revenues, which exceeded $3 billion last season, but that offer was rejected. The players responded with their three offers that went nowhere. The NHL proposal was contingent on the league playing a full season, which now won't happen. The league has called that its best offer and has since pulled it back. "Last week we had a proposal to save a full season on the table. That has since been withdrawn," Daly told the AP. "That creates a different environment for talks." Players earned 57 percent of revenue in the recently expired contract, in which a salary cap was included for the first time. Owners originally sought to bring that number below 50 percent this time before their most recent offer. The players' association tried to get talks restarted last week, but was turned away by the NHL because the union declined to agree to bargain off the framework of the league's offer or issue another proposal with the league's offer serving as a starting point. Players want negotiations to resume without any preconditions. There is a major divide between the sides over how to deal with existing player contracts. The union wants to ensure that those are all paid in full without affecting future player contracts. League Commissioner Gary Bettman
expressed a willingness to discuss the "make whole" provisions on existing contracts, but only if the economic portions of the league's offer are accepted first by the union. This is the third lockout in Bettman's tenure. The first forced a shortened 1994-95 season, and the second led to the cancellation of the entire 2004-05 season—the only time a major North American professional sports league lost a full season to a labor dispute. This Winter Classic was the first one scheduled for a college stadium—after the previous five were played in NFL or baseball stadiums—and the first to plan other ice events in a different venue as part of the celebration. Comerica Park, home to the American League champion Detroit Tigers, was supposed to host The Hockeytown Winter Festival and the NHL Alumni Showdown. Those events are also casualties of the lockout.

ICE Chief Challenges Stock Views of Trading By
Jacob Bunge
Dec. 25, 2012 7:36 p.m. ET
Jeffrey Sprecher, the derivatives boss set to take control of America's most storied stock exchange, believes the stock market is ready for a shake-up. The chief executive and chairman of IntercontinentalExchange Inc., which last week unveiled plans to buy NYSE Euronext for $8.2 billion, isn't steeped in the business of equities trading. But he has plenty to say about it, including some views that challenge the prevailing wisdom and...

Protesters Wage Campaign Against Wal-Mart
By
Shelly Banjo
And Ann Zimmerman Updated Nov. 23, 2012 6:27 p.m. ET
SECAUCUS, N.J.—As customers hauled big-screen TVs and videogame consoles out of a Wal-Mart store here on one of the busiest shopping days of the year, about 100 protesters handed out fliers and held signs that read "Wal-Mart = greed" and "Wal-Mart = 1%." The lunchtime protest was part of a campaign organized by a union-backed group at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. locations across the country on Thanksgiving night and Black Friday. OUR Walmart, or Organization United for Respect at Walmart, was created in 2010...

Sabra sales were estimated to reach $315 million last year.
Bloomberg News CLOVER, Va.—Prodded by the largest U.S. hummus maker, farmers in the heart of tobacco country are trying to grow chickpeas, an improbable move that reflects booming demand for hummus. The humble chickpea is having a heyday. But while demand for chickpeas and hummus is high, farmers are preparing themselves for a potential shortage. David Kesmodel has details. Photo: AP.

and Israel's Strauss Group Ltd., wants to cultivate a commercial crop in Virginia to reduce its dependence on the legume's main U.S. growing region—the Pacific Northwest—and to identify new chickpea varieties for its dips and spreads. For Sabra, which makes hummus at a plant near Richmond, Va., a secondary source of supplies could help protect the company if a chickpea shortage occurred because of crop failures in Washington or Idaho. Sourcing chickpeas locally also would lower its shipping costs. But the Virginia effort carries risk, because experts say the state's high summer humidity could prove a significant obstacle to its viability. "We need to establish the supply chain to meet our growing demand," says Sabra's chief technology officer, Tulin Tuzel.
"We want to reduce the risk of bad weather or concentration in one region. If possible, we also want to expand the growing seasons." Long a staple of Middle Eastern cuisine, hummus is earning a growing following among Americans seeking more-healthful snacks. The chickpea dip is low in fat and high in protein. Sales of "refrigerated flavored spreads"—a segment dominated by hummus—totaled $530 million at U.S. food retailers last year, up 11% from a year earlier and a 25% jump over 2010, according to market-research firm Information Resources Inc.

, don't provide information to IRI, the figures understate Sabra's retail sales. Sabra, based in White Plains, N.Y., has helped introduce more Americans to hummus through huge sampling events in major cities in which it has handed out 10,000 2-ounce packages a day. Sabra began its first national television advertising campaign earlier this year. "Most of the consumers out there still don't know what hummus is," said Adam Carr,
chief executive of Tribe Mediterranean Foods Inc., a Sabra rival. "We think that there are going to be lots of new users coming to the category." Growing demand for hummus has pushed up prices for chickpeas, spurring farmers to increase production. The average price that farmers received for chickpeas was 35 cents a pound last year, a 10-cent increase over the mid-2000s, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Though chickpeas are a tiny crop compared with corn or wheat, last year's U.S. harvest totaled a record 332 million pounds, up 51% from the previous year, according to the USDA. The value of the U.S. chickpea crop hit a record $115.5 million last year, USDA data show. Enlarge Image
Last year's U.S. chickpea harvest jumped 51% from the previous year. Above, Virginia farmer James Brown is testing the legume.
David Kesmodel/The Wall Street Journal U.S. farmers are expected to plant a record 214,300 acres of chickpeas this year, up 3% from last year and a fivefold increase over a decade ago, the USDA said. Demand for the U.S. crop from Spain, Turkey and Pakistan also has led farmers to plant more. In Walla Walla, Wash., farmer Pat McConnell,
51, said he intends this spring to plant about 950 acres with chickpeas, more than double his crop last year. "They've become a pretty lucrative option," he said. "I really think chickpeas are going to continue to grow in popularity." Virginia officials are eager to develop new crops in a state where tobacco farming has shrunk dramatically since the 1990s because of declining cigarette sales. Sabra has provided financial support for chickpea research at Virginia State University, and this spring, Virginia State recruited farmers to plant chickpeas in on-farm trials. But Virginia's summer humidity and heat could make chickpeas more susceptible to a fungus known as Ascochyta blight that long has threatened chickpea crops in the U.S. Virginia State University agronomist Harbans Bhardwaj
is working on identifying a variety more suited to the climate, that could potentially be planted months earlier than most chickpeas. Mr. Bhardwaj thinks Virginia farmers may be able to grow the crop on a commercial scale within three years. James Brown,
a 72-year-old tobacco, corn and soybean farmer in Clover, Va., said he knew nothing about chickpeas when an extension agent from Virginia State called him several months ago and asked if he would plant the legume. He said he jumped at the opportunity because he is looking for ways to make his roughly 300-acre farm more profitable. Mr. Brown planted four acres with chickpeas in mid-April. That week, his wife served him the first chickpeas he'd ever eaten. "They tasted pretty good," the farmer said.

Nephew of Blind Activist Gets Jail Term
By
Josh Chin
Updated Nov. 30, 2012 10:40 a.m. ET
BEIJING—A Chinese court sentenced the nephew of blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng to 39 months in prison after an unexpected trial on Friday, according to a close family friend, in a case that Mr. Chen believes is part of a long government campaign to intimidate and silence him. Chen Kegui had been charged with assaulting officials who burst into his home after his uncle staged a daring escape from informal house arrest in his village in northeastern China's Shandong province in April and fled for protection to the...

Republicans Get Filibusted
Democrats end the 60-vote Senate rule for presidential nominees. Updated July 17, 2013 8:07 p.m. ET
Senate Majority Leader Rich Trumka, er, Harry Reid held a gun to the head of Republicans on the filibuster, Republicans blinked, and President Obama and the AFL-CIO will now get their nominees confirmed for the cabinet and especially a legal quorum for the National Labor Relations Board. Cut through all the procedural blather and that's the essence of the Senate's "deal" Tuesday over the 60-vote filibuster rule. While Democrats didn't formally pull the trigger of the "nuclear option" to allow a mere...

At midday, the piazza in front of the famous Monte Carlo Casino teems with life. Men in handmade suits conduct business meetings al fresco, well-groomed teens take a break from shopping to flick their hair and check their phones and ladies of a certain age exercise minuscule dogs. Building Up Monaco
View Slideshow
A rendering of the Tour Odéon is shown. A penthouse apartment will have its own swimming pool.
Groupo Marzocco This is the heart of Monaco, the tiny seaside tax haven long known as a playground of the international jet set and one of the world's most expensive real-estate markets. Behind that image of opulence, though, is a sobering fact: Much of the property available here isn't very glamorous. "Most of the apartment blocks in Monaco are outdated, and need to be redone," says Pieter van Naeltwijck,
who represents the Knight Frank agency in the principality. Gesturing to a photo of the Monaco skyline in his office, he says, "This one is horrible, this one is also horrible, this one looks like a prison." The problem, he explains, is that many buildings were erected in the 1970s and 1980s with undersize kitchens and old-fashioned fittings. "Life has changed, but they have not really adapted." Now, change is coming in the form of Tour Odéon, a 49-story, 550-foot-tall residential tower featuring apartments with marble floors, teak carpentry and expensive German-made Bulthaup kitchens. Enlarge Image
The $790 million Tour Odéon Development rises high above the other apartment buildings in Monaco. Prices for apartments in the building run about $25 million. A rendering is shown.
Groupo Marzocco When it's completed this summer, it will be the principality's tallest building, standing a head taller than its nearest rival, Le Millefiori, a 37-story apartment block built in the late 1960s. Its sweeping glass facade, commonplace for other cities, will further set it apart from the rest of Monaco's concrete skyline. The $790 million development was launched late last summer, with 24 apartments offered for sale. By February, 18 had been sold to European buyers at prices well above $25 million. Those that remain include a 3,300-square-foot apartment for $28.2 million and a 4,600-square foot unit listed at $36.7 million—double Monaco's average home price. Bolstered by prices like these, this sliver of land pressed between the Mediterranean Sea and France is proving to be one of the few parts of the Western world to emerge strongly from the global property recession. According to newly released official figures, the world-wide downturn registered as a mere blip in Monaco's real-estate market. Average house prices in the principality now stand at a record $3,700 per square foot. That's double what they were in 2006 and up smartly from the crisis year of 2009, when they ticked down to about $3,100 a square foot. Partly driving this resilience are Monaco's enduring charms—a mild Mediterranean climate, fabulous boutiques and restaurants, the timeless, iconic allure of Princess Grace. There are also powerful financial incentives for home buyers. Aside from French nationals—who are bound by a binational treaty—residents pay no income, property or capital-gains tax to the Monaco government. Mr. van Naeltwijck says global political volatility has also stimulated interest from overseas buyers, particularly from Russia. "If you were living in Moscow, would you not rather have your wife and children in a nice, safe, sunny place without the fiscal problems which are present in, say, France?" he asks. View Graphics
It also has celebrity sparkle. Actor Roger Moore,
tennis player Novak Djokovic
and race-car driver Lewis Hamilton
all own property in Monaco. Each May, the greatest racing drivers in the world hurtle through Monaco's narrow streets in the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix. Everyone from Mick Jagger
to Kate Moss
has vacationed there, while Will Smith
turned out for last year's Grand Prix. Madonna
partied there following the end of her European tour last year, and Eva Longoria
attended last year's Monte Carlo TV Festival. Another reason for the persistently high prices is scarcity. On the fewer than 500 acres of land that constitute Monaco—a patch smaller than New York's Central Park—there's little space left in which to build. "A lack of supply is one of the reasons prices are high," says Mr. van Naeltwijck. "But in a way, it is a bad thing, as we cannot grow." Enlarge Image
Nate Padavick In the past, the principality has eased its property shortage with land-reclamation projects, including a major program led by Prince Rainier
in the 1960s and 1970s. New tracts of land were created to establish the district of Fontvieille, by effectively building a platform over the sea, with space for new harbor facilities, a stadium, a hotel and a park dedicated to Princess Grace. Prince Albert II,
the reigning monarch, has flirted with the idea of another land-reclamation project, inviting bids and briefly giving his support in 2010 to a design by Daniel Libeskind,
the architect who drew up the master plan for the reconstruction of New York's World Trade Center. The government hoped it would be completed by 2011. But the prince has apparently since changed his mind about the scale, feasibility and wisdom of such a project at Larvotto, and the project was quietly shelved. For now, with land so scarce, Monaco's new housing inventory comes in small packages. After Tour Odéon, the next big development coming to Monaco is a cluster of seven low-rise pavilions planned for a prime location seconds from the casino. An Art Deco cinema and shopping mall will be replaced by a modern mixed-use project, including 36 apartments designed by the British architect Richard Rogers due to be built by 2016. Even at the larger-scale Tour Odéon, relatively few homes will be available to foreign buyers. The development has 259 apartments, but the majority have been bought by the Monaco government and will be rented to native Monégasques at subsidized rates. The developer, Groupe Marzocco, is holding on to another 49 apartments for now, including a vast five-story, 36,000-square-foot penthouse. While Tour Odéon may be better-appointed than other offerings, its location near the French border and 1,000 feet north of prestigious Avenue Princess Grace—light years, by Monaco standards—effectively puts it on the wrong side of the tracks. Nathalie Gamory,
of Monaco Real Estate, an affiliate of the Savills agency, says that on Monaco's scale, a short distance can make a vast difference in price. She cites the case of a building on the Boulevard d'Italie, where a one-bedroom, roughly 650-square-foot (plus terrace) apartment rents for $3,400 a month, plus a $330 service charge. A mere football field away, in Metropole-Centre, a comparable one-bedroom that's not even twice as big rents for five times the price: $17,000 a month, plus $1,400 in fees. "There really is no logic," says Ms. Gamory. "There is not really a meaningful explanation as to why one area is fashionable and one is not, because they are all so close." Those seeking more fashionable surroundings should look to Larvotto on the eastern edge of the principality, for its great sea views, and Carré d'Or, site of all the finest boutiques. The most beautiful area is "the Rock"—the local nickname for the historic streets around the royal palace that are filled with period townhouses. It's not for everyone, though, as many of its narrow cobblestone streets cannot be accessed by car. A modest-size townhouse there sells for around $9.1 million.

On Monday, a federal court in Manhattan granted yet another extension to Google and a group of authors and publishers as they try to reach a settlement in the landmark digital books case. They are expected to submit a revised proposal today. But whatever the ultimate agreement, this case is a giant missed opportunity. The class action suit, brought in 2005, challenged Google's unauthorized scanning of copyrighted works to create a vast searchable database of books. It raised a critical question: Are search engines allowed, under the legal doctrine of "fair use," to make and store full copies of texts to power their search functions, profit from this material, and at the same time demand that copyright holders opt out if they don't want to be google-able? The answer has importance far beyond the book-scanning project—it involves the very legality of how search engines operate on the Internet. If search engines cannot make full copies of books and Web sites without permission from copyright holders, their own business model would be jeopardized. When leading publishers and authors sued Google for violations of copyright, it appeared that the first serious test case was at hand. And yet, as the litigation proceeded, the question that prompted the lawsuit—whether search engines are fair users—fell away entirely. The settlement agreement doesn't even address fair use standards for the future. Instead, the focus is now on the competitive concerns of allowing one company to have such a dominant role in digital book publishing, specifically on the treatment of "orphan works" (texts whose authors cannot be found). Search engine caching—the process through which automated crawlers travel across the Internet, sweep up the contents of Web sites, and index them into searchable databases—is so fundamental to how information is distributed today that it's too big for any one case. It's a policy question that Congress has to tackle to give copyright owners a fair share of the revenue that their content generates on the Web. The "snippets" of text that appear on your screen after you've entered a term in a search engine are produced from a complete copy stored in a search engine's server. True, the search results are only a few lines of text. But copyright is not limited to "display" rights. It includes exclusive rights to "reproduction" as well. And that surely means the storing of the complete text. The search engines argue that they do not have to pay rights holders because the full copies they index are for a purpose different from the original. In addition, they say that they help make Web sites more valuable by driving readers to them. Publishers certainly like the traffic. But since only a few search engines control the market, publishers have had little choice but to play by their rules. Google has consistently compared itself to the neighborhood library. When it was sued by Agence France Presse for copyright violations in 2005—a case that also settled before any judge ruled on the fair use issue—Google described itself "as important to the web as a card catalog is to a library." A public library, Google said in Agence France Presse v. Google Inc., "would be of limited use without an index or some other means to organize and find particular volumes of interest." The copyright code allows public libraries to copy texts as long as there is no "direct or indirect commercial advantage." But that does not describe what search engines do. They use the complete copies they take for free to sell the advertising that has made them enormously profitable. This has a direct impact on book publishers, and on the publishers of magazines and newspapers that are losing the advertising that once supported them. According to Ken Auletta's recently released book "Googled," its search business alone now takes in 40% of all advertising across the Internet. Consistent with the handling of copying by libraries, indexing without any commercial gain should be protected as fair use. But it should not be controversial to legislate that once the cache is monetized for the benefit of the search engine, the line of copyright infringement is crossed. The absence of such defined rules gave Google a green light to proceed with its book scanning project and establish itself as the proprietor of the world's largest digital bookstore. In the last year, many fresh ideas have begun to circulate on how to help the publishing industry transition profitably to the online world. But without legal reform to back up these new business models, publishers will not have the bargaining power to make the search engines into true partners willing to compensate them meaningfully for their copyrights. —Messrs.
