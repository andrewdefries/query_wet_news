By
I Made Sentana and James Hookway Updated Sept. 18, 2012 12:14 a.m. ET
JAKARTA—Demonstrations related to an anti-Islam video showed no signs of ebbing, with a reported suicide bomber in Afghanistan and protesters battling police there and in Indonesia nearly a week after angry crowds swarmed the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya. In Afghanistan on Tuesday morning, a suicide bomber rammed a car into a minivan, killing at least nine people, including foreigners, reports said....

Public-radio program "This American Life" has retracted an episode that had been critical of Apple's manufacturing practices in China, saying that it contained "significant fabrications." Ian Sherr has details on The News Hub. Photo: AP
Producers of the radio series "This American Life" retracted one of the most popular programs in its 16-year history, saying that it contained a series of fabricated statements. "We can't vouch for its truth," said host Ira Glass,

's manufacturing practices in China. Mr. Glass accused Mr. Daisey of lying to him and another producer during fact-checking on the story. The broadcast was an excerpt from Mr. Daisey's one-man theatrical show "The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs," which has been playing at various theaters for more than a year. In the two-hour show, Mr. Daisey describes his visit to a factory in Shenzhen, China owned by a manufacturer known as Foxconn. That trip became a touchstone for Mr. Daisey, who wrote about Apple's manufacturing in an op-ed article for the New York Times, and appeared on numerous television interviews to discuss what he found there. Related Listen to the Episode Retracting the Original Program Transcript of the Episode Retracting the Program Read the 'This American Life' Statement Read Mike Daisey's Statement Earlier: Terry Teachout's Review of 'The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs' Delivered as an intimate and emotional discussion, Mr. Daisey helped put a new spotlight on labor conditions in factories that make Apple's gadgets. In it, he describes encountering 12-year-old employees near the factory gates, while also meeting clandestinely with workers who came in contact with a toxic chemical that left their hands shaking "uncontrollably." The show touched a nerve among listeners of "This American Life," which airs on 500 public-radio stations around the U.S., and is now the most popular podcast download on Apple's own iTunes music service. One listener began a petition protesting work conditions at Foxconn factories that garnered some 250,000 signatures. Mr. Daisey's story unraveled after a reporter from a different radio program, American Public Media's "Marketplace," met with the translator used by Mr. Daisey on his travels to Shenzhen. The reporter, Rob Schmitz, said the translator disputed much of Mr. Daisey's account. Mr. Schmitz later confronted Mr. Daisey, and according to a transcript posted online, asked the stage performer about the workers he said were poisoned by the toxic chemical known as N-hexane. "So you lied about that?" Mr Schmitz asked. "I wouldn't express it that way," Mr. Daisey responded. "How would you express it?" Mr. Schmitz asked. "I would say that I wanted to tell a story that captured the totality of my trip," Mr. Daisey said. Last month, Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook
defended the company's oversight of its facilities at an investor conference in San Francisco, saying Apple takes the matter seriously. Apple also recently opened its factories to outside inspectors for the first time and began reporting some results of its factory audits more regularly. The company also went on a media offensive of its own, inviting ABC News into a Foxconn factory. An ABC reporter found evidence of teenagers doing work of "soul-crushing boredom" that was better than the conditions where they were from in the countryside. An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the retraction and whether Apple played a role in causing it. In a statement, Mr. Daisey said he stood by his work, though he noted his work is a theatrical piece, and not journalism. "The tools of the theater are not the same as the tools of journalism," he said. "For this reason, I regret that I allowed 'This American Life' to air an excerpt from my monologue." New York's Public Theater, where Mr. Daisey's one-man show is scheduled to finish its run on Sunday, said in a statement that "we wish he had been more precise with us and our audiences about what was and wasn't his personal experience in the piece." The theater defended the performance, saying that "In the theater, our job is to create fictions that reveal truth—that's what a storyteller does, that's what a dramatist does." It added that Mr. Daisey "has illuminated how our actions affect people half-a-world away and, in doing so, has spurred action to address a troubling situation." On Friday afternoon, the New York Times removed a paragraph from an opinion piece Mr. Daisey had written for the paper's website. The paragraph recounted a story from Mr. Daisey's monologue, in which he met a man with a hand "permanently curled into a claw"—an account that "This American Life" said was also false. "We asked him questions and talked about his travel. We took him at his word," said Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. The Times, which had separately published a series of its own articles about Apple's factories, said it stood by those. "We do something very different. Our standard is a journalistic one." The episode is also an embarrassment for Mr. Glass. "We never should've put this on the air," he said in the statement. "In the end, this was our mistake." "This American Life," Mr. Glass added, plans to "devote its entire program this weekend to detailing the errors in the story." Write to Ian Sherr at ian.sherr@dowjones.com, Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com and Jessica E. Vascellaro at jessica.vascellaro@wsj.com Corrections & Amplifications Rob Schmitz is the reporter from American Public Media's "Marketplace" who found that Mr. Daisey's translator disputed much of his account. An earlier version of this article omitted Mr. Schmitz's first name. Also, "This American Life" is produced by Chicago Public Media. An earlier version of this article included a summary that incorrectly said it was a National Public Radio program. Email

Europe to Add Horse-Meat Tests
By
Matthew Dalton
Updated Feb. 14, 2013 8:36 a.m. ET
BRUSSELS—European Union authorities on Wednesday proposed a testing campaign over the next month to uncover how broadly Europe's beef supply is contaminated with horse meat. The region's horse-meat scandal has widened, raising fears about the complex supply chains of modern Europe's food industry. Since Irish authorities announced the presence of horse DNA in frozen beef burgers in mid-January, horse DNA has been found in processed...

LONDON—Researchers said the long-lost remains of King Richard III have been found and identified—after sitting under what is now a parking lot in the English Midlands for more than 500 years. The findings could solve a centuries-old mystery involving one of England's most-storied rulers, who has remained in the public fascination through a Shakespeare play and Hollywood movies. King Richard III Grave Confirmed

King Richard III was the last English king to die in battle. A painting of the King by an unknown artist from the 16th Century hangs at the National Portrait Gallery in London.
Neil Hall/Reuters Further Reading Bones of Contention: If the Skeleton Is Richard III, Where to Bury It? (Jan. 18, 2013)
University of Leicester researchers said at a news conference Monday that DNA tests on bones recently unearthed in an archaeological dig in Leicester match samples taken from two living descendants of Richard's sister. A separate skeletal analysis showed striking similarities between the unearthed bones and features Richard was said to have had, they said. "It was the result we were all waiting to hear," the university said. "In one of the most important announcements in the University's history, our academics have today revealed that the…skeleton is indeed that of King Richard III." Richard III, the controversial 15th century English monarch, was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. The story goes that the body was taken to nearby Leicester, about 100 miles north of London, after his death. Until recently, no one had tried to dig up his remains. In September, archaeologists at the University of Leicester acted on a hunch that Richard may have been buried under a city council parking lot. Archaeologists started to dig and within a week had found a skeleton and a medieval friary, raising hopes that Richard's remains had been found. DNA tests suggest that bones found under a parking lot in Leicester, England, are those of King Richard III, who ruled from 1483 to 1485 before being killed at the Battle of Bosworth. Dow Jones's Jenny Gross looks at the debate over where he should be buried.
Tests showed the man whose remains were found was likely to have been killed by one or two injuries to the skull, which fits with the story that Richard was killed in battle by sword or ax. "The corpse was subjected to 'humiliation injuries'—including a sword through the right buttock," the university said. The skeleton also has a curved spine, just as Richard was reported to have. Radiocarbon dating revealed the individual had a high-protein diet, including significant amounts of seafood, a sign he was of high status, the university said. "I'm delighted it's been proven to be Richard, but after all the humiliation he has suffered in his reputation it's a shame his remains now have to be flashed around on the Internet," said Sally Henshaw,
secretary of the Richard III Society branch in East Midlands. "At least we know we'll be able to put him to rest finally and he will be buried as an anointed king should be." The bones will be reinterred in Leicester, where his remains stayed for more than 500 years. Some Richard III enthusiasts had called for the skeleton to be buried in York and others in Westminster Abbey or Windsor Castle, where other monarchs are interred. "It's fantastic—absolutely brilliant," said Richard Smith,
another member of the Richard III Society. "I'll be able to visit him frequently so that'll be very fortunate for me." Stephen Stearns,
a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University, said it is perfectly possible to recover mitochondrial DNA from a 500-year-old human skeleton and get an accurate read on whether it matches a living descendent. Still, Dr. Stearns expressed some reservations. He said the University of Leicester is known for its evolutionary geneticists, but there is always a chance evidence can be tampered with or for other distortions. "Scientists only trust a conclusion that's been shot at as hard as possible and still remains standing. And that process hasn't really started yet." Still, he said, "It's pretty convincing to the evolution geneticists who look at it. I think you can say either it's Richard III or there was another hunchback who was killed at the same place at the same time. However the DNA evidence makes it unlikely it's another hunchback." Leicester officials said they hope the prospect of a proper burial site would be a boost to tourism, creating a focal point for a king who ruled England for just two years, but whose story has long captivated enthusiasts. Richard became king in 1483, taking power from his nephew, the 12-year-old Edward V. Richard said Edward was an illegitimate heir as the product of his father's second marriage. Richard was said to have imprisoned his two nephews in the Tower of London. Within months of Richard's taking the throne, the two nephews disappeared, and some assumed Richard had them murdered. Some historians say Richard was an evil, power-hungry ruler who murdered family members to quicken his rise to the throne. William Shakespeare's "Richard III" helped to popularize this depiction, describing Richard as a crippled villain who killed anyone in his path to the throne. Others say this description is fictional, and one spread by Henry Tudor, Richard's successor, whose army killed Richard in battle. Shakespeare was born about 80 years after Richard died and wrote during the Tudor dynasty. Pro-Richard enthusiasts say a closer look at Richard's reign shows he was one of the most progressive rulers of his time and one who promoted foreign trade and books. His death at the Battle of Bosworth Field, outside of Leicester, marked a pivotal moment in English history and in the struggle for power between the House of York and the House of Lancaster, known as the "The Wars of the Roses." Richard was the last of the Plantagenet kings to rule and his defeat by Henry VII began the start of the Tudor dynasty, which lasted for more than a century.

Yen's Slide Is Unlikely to Last
By
Clare Connaghan
Nov. 15, 2012 4:44 p.m. ET
The yen's slide to a 6½-month low against the dollar threatens to tarnish its status as a haven currency, but a significant shift away from that role still looks unlikely, even if aggressive monetary easing helps to weaken it in the coming months. The Japanese currency has long been a beacon of safety in times of market stress, even though Japan's economy has struggled with deflation for two decades and the country has the heaviest...

The U.S. exports more aircraft and heavy equipment than it imports. Above, workers in Peoria, Ill., at a Komatsu plant that builds mining trucks.
Daniel Acker for The Wall Street Journal PEORIA, Ill.—Robert LeTourneau, a roving American evangelist and inventor, decided in the mid-1930s that a plot of lakefront land a mile and a half northeast of downtown Peoria would be a fine place to make earth-moving equipment. Skilled labor and suppliers were plentiful; transport links were good. Nearly eight decades later, Japan's Komatsu Ltd.

, which owns the plant, still thinks Mr. LeTourneau chose the right location—even though most giant mining trucks made there are shipped overseas to Latin America, Australia, Asia and Africa. The U.S. may not be much good at making small things like smartphones, but it is still a global leader in some of the biggest products, such as mining trucks as big as a two-story house and capable of hauling 400 tons of ore, James Hagerty reports on the News Hub.

makes its large mining trucks, most of which are exported. Caterpillar, No. 1 in this market, and No. 2 Komatsu account for roughly 85% of global sales of these trucks, roughly the size of two-story houses. Their presence has created a cluster of skills and suppliers that feeds the industry. At a time when politicians are hoping for a job-creating revival of American manufacturing, this is one area where U.S.-based plants are still global champions. Inside a dimly lit Komatsu building roughly the size of seven football fields, workers weld together the 30-ton frame of a mining truck. They choreograph their movements to avoid spraying each other with sparks or searing their eyes with blue light. "You almost have to make it a ballet," said Jim Mathis,
a general manager at the plant. Some workers have fathers and grandfathers who made trucks here. The U.S. had a deficit of $509.7 billion in trade in manufactured goods in this year's first nine months, largely due to gaping deficits in such major categories as consumer electronics and clothing. More Top U.S. Firms Are Cash-Rich Abroad, Cash-Poor at Home But in certain areas—notably aircraft, industrial engines, excavators and railway and mining equipment—the U.S. exports far more than it imports. These industries produce relatively small numbers of very expensive goods, requiring specialized technology and labor. Their competitive advantage rests partly on expertise built by U.S. companies in making durable, high-tech weaponry and other equipment for the military—frequently applicable to other products. "We have a very strong and very innovative military," said Cliff Waldman,
a senior economist at Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation, an Arlington, Va., research organization. That creates an infrastructure for manufacturing and spurs innovation in such areas as metallurgy and engines. Determining where the U.S. can gain competitive edges is part of the challenge of creating more well-paid manufacturing jobs, a priority of the Obama administration, which is budgeting more money for research into manufacturing processes. Can the U.S. return to a surplus on manufacturing trade? "Probably not," said Mr. Waldman, "but I think we will do better." "We need to broaden our capabilities," said Gary Pisano,
a professor at Harvard Business School, who writes about global competition. He prescribes more training of engineers and high-skill manufacturing workers, a longer-term investment horizon for managers and government support for research in advanced materials, biotechnology and nanotechnology. Manufacturers benefit from clusters of suppliers and workers with specialized skills. Such clusters make Taiwan a powerhouse in semiconductors and China nearly unbeatable in smartphones and other consumer electronics.

Daniel Acker for The Wall Street Journal That local expertise attracted Komatsu. After being owned by Mr. LeTourneau, Westinghouse Electric and Dresser Industries, the Peoria plant was sold to Komatsu about two decades ago as part of the Japanese company's effort to establish a major American presence. Komatsu makes smaller mining trucks in Japan, but its largest trucks, able to carry as much as 360 tons of ore, come from Peoria. Given decades of investment in skilled labor and nearby suppliers, "it's not so easy just to pick it up and start somewhere else," said Rod Schrader,
CEO of Komatsu's U.S. arm. Global demand for large mining trucks is too small to justify more than one plant. The global market for large mining trucks, those that can carry 200 tons or more, is likely to reach about 1,900 to 2,000 vehicles this year, up from 1,591 in 2011, said Peter Gilewicz,
managing director of Parker Bay Co., a mining industry research firm. The trucks typically sell for $2.5 million to $6 million each, executives say. More than 90% are built at North American plants owned by Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi Construction Machinery Co.

Lumbini, Nepal Many have long lamented the untapped tourism potential of Lumbini, known as 'the Buddhist Mecca.'
REUTERS The plain of Terai, a poor agricultural land crossed by holy rivers, straddles the border between Nepal and India. Its sweltering summers see temperatures climb above 100 degrees, but this parched terrain might be on the verge of tumultuous changes. On the Nepali side is the small city of Lumbini, which, after long neglect, is now at the center of great power politics. This is where the Lord Buddha was born, about 2,500 years ago, under a bodhi tree at the bend of a small creek. His mother, a Hindu princess called Maya, was traveling to her parental home in Kapilavastu when her labor started, and all her entourage could do was stop and arrange a place for her to give birth under the tree, near a pool of water. Lumbini, sometimes called "the Buddhist Mecca," has been described as a potential gold mine for Nepal, and many have been lamenting that its impressive tourist potential should be so underdeveloped, with just a small white temple sitting on the holy grounds. Those who come, though, appreciate the calm of the place, and sit cross-legged in meditation, or murmur sacred scriptures in small groups. Monks and nuns from all over the Buddhist world tour the temple, which shelters a series of carved stones that depict the holy birth, and just sit on the grass outside, in contemplation. The idea of developing Lumbini has long been toyed with by various organizations, from the World Federation of Buddhists to the United Nations, not forgetting numerous Nepali agencies that have looked at the birthplace of the Buddha as a possible resource. The U.N. got its eyes on Lumbini early on, under the presidency of U Thant, himself a Buddhist, who visited in 1967. Three years later, the U.N. International Committee for the Development of Lumbini (now the U.N. Lumbini Development Trust) was established, with the approval of the Hindu King Mahendra, traditionally regarded as a descendant of Hindu gods. In 1972 the committee selected Japanese architect Kenzō Tange
to draw up a project for a Peace Park that would surround the temple, approved by the king (who died later that year) and the committee itself. Six years and a few more high-level U.N. visits later, part of what became known as the Tange Master Plan is now partially built. Arched red-brick bridges reach over a straight canal, and a red-brick museum with a Bauhaus-like flair to it sits by a reflecting pool about a quarter of a mile from the small white temple. The U.N. involvement means a lot of emphasis is given to representing Buddhist nations: On one side of the canal, every country that follows the Theravadha ("Small Vehicle") tradition of Buddhism—such as Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka and Thailand—has, or will have, a temple. The other side is reserved for the countries following the Mahayana tradition ("Greater Vehicle"), like China, Japan, Korea and Mongolia. It translates into a hodgepodge of styles and many replicas of famous buildings. Burma has built a concrete Shwedagon Pagoda; China, a smaller version of the Forbidden City. So far only about a dozen of the foreseen 42 buildings have been erected. One of the problems has been the lack of cash: The finished project should cost about $64 million in total, but not all contributing Buddhist countries see this as a priority. Enter the Asia Pacific Exchange and Cooperation Foundation (APECF), a well-funded Chinese association headed by a rather mysterious figure, Linus Xiao Wunan.
A Buddhist and a Chinese Communist Party member, he wants to see a whole Peace City built here and a tower called "Lumbini Cloud." "We have already broken ground," says Mr. Xiao, in his living room in a diplomatic compound in Beijing, showing an artist's impression of a tall and slender "celestial observatory" building that will host restaurants, temples, shops and prayer rooms in a circular ring built several hundred feet from the ground. "We have agreed on a project with VTP Global," he says, referring to a theme-park development group based in London. Around him, a confusing array of pictures hints at a complex biography: At the back, Mr. Xiao is seen posing next to the Dalai Lama, whom he met in Dharamsala, where the Tibetan government in exile resides. Other photos show him surrounded by high prelates of various Buddhist sects. But next to where he sits, on a coffee table, is a portrait of Mao Zedong.
"We have the full support of the Nepali government," he says. Not that Nepal has much of one at present, since a caretaker administration has been sitting in Kathmandu for the past 10 years. Before that, a lengthy civil war led to a short-lived communist government, which subsequently collapsed. The next elections are scheduled for November. The caretakers are headed by Pushpa Kamal Dahal,
the former leader of the Maoist guerrilla known as Prachanda, or "the Fierce," who also sits on the board of the Lumbini Cloud Project, and has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Mr. Xiao to go ahead with it. Not everyone is in accord, and some even see self-interest in Dahal's motives, but Mr. Xiao is not troubled with these developments. Yet he remains vague on many details—like questions about where the $3 billion he claims to have for Lumbini is coming from, or if the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is backing APECF. "APECF is part of the grander strategy of increasing China's soft power," Mr. Xiao says, "but we are independent, and the Lumbini development project is our own idea." Still, China is also getting busy building an international airport here, with direct flights from major Chinese cities, as well as restaurants and hotels to cater to the devout masses. The U.N. is also still involved: Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary General and himself a Buddhist, has often mentioned the need to develop Lumbini, and those in the know say that the push comes from Mr. Ban's mother, a fervent Buddhist. At least one Korean sect, called Chhoge, has been received by Mr. Dahal for this very reason, and according to Nepali newspaper reports Mr. Dahal has signed an MOU with it, too. "Our plans are not incompatible," says Mr. Xiao in Beijing. "This is going to be for the whole Buddhist world. To those who find it too striking, I say: At the beginning nobody liked the Pyramid at the Louvre." India, once more, is left looking uneasily as China expands its influence in its backyard, tapping into the soft-power potential of Buddhism, and an air of Buddhist Great Game can be felt in what was until now the sleepy, holy site of Buddha's birth.

Dec. 19, 2012 6:52 p.m. ET
In late 2001, David Horvath
signed a letter to his college sweetheart, Sun-Min Kim,
with a drawing of a wide-eyed monster with long arms, stubby legs, fangs and a giant head. Ms. Kim turned the artwork into a plush doll, and Mr. Horvath showed it to a friend who owned a Los Angeles toy store. The friend requested 20, and Ms. Kim got to work sewing, assembling new dolls in an array of bright colors based on an "Ugly-verse" of 60 characters that Mr. Horvath dreamt up. Orders from more toy stores began trickling in, and by the end of 2002, sales were outpacing the couple's ability to keep up. David Horvath: 'You have to plan for ultimate success from the first day.'
Stephanie Diani for The Wall Street Journal The two formed Pretty Ugly LLC and began outsourcing production of Uglydolls to a Korean manufacturer. Their first big break came in late 2003, when the couple set up a booth at a toy industry show in New York. They were bombarded with orders from small toy and gift shops and landed their first big account with Tower Records, the now defunct music chain. Pretty Ugly—now based in Green Brook, N.J., and employing about a dozen people—has generated more than $100 million in retail sales since its inception. It became profitable in 2003, and today its toys, apparel, ceramics and other branded goods are sold in more than 10,000 retail stores world-wide. Consumers buy over two million UglyDolls-branded items annually. Mr. Horvath continues to design new characters, and Ms. Kim still turns them into dolls before they go into mass production. The two, who married in 2005, create the characters' story lines and share responsibility for managing the brand. Mr. Horvath, 41 years old, spoke to The Wall Street Journal about how to protect a brand and what makes a brand successful. Edited excerpts: WSJ: How did you come up with the Uglydolls concept? Mr. Horvath: It started on paper. After Sun graduated from college, she had to move back to Korea because her student visa had expired. I wrote her a letter and said, "Don't worry, we'll make this work," and I signed it with the Ugly character Wage. As a surprise, she brought him to life as a plush doll. We had always wanted to tell stories through a brand about what ugly meant to us—it's not something negative; it means different, unique—and the doll was the missing link. WSJ: How did you settle on a price for Uglydolls? Mr. Horvath: We wanted to find a balance between Sun's hard work and something reasonable. The dolls are still hand-sewn, and the first store we were in had other handmade toys going for several hundred dollars. We started selling the classic size—12 inches—for $20, and we've just stayed at that. We haven't really needed to raise prices, though I can't say it will stay that way forever. WSJ: What is that fleece-like material you use in Uglydolls? Mr. Horvath: We call it Ugly fur. Sun found it in an enormous textile place in Korea. The factory that made the material had long since stopped producing it, so we bought up what was left. When we ran out, we were forced to replicate it. The factory gave us the formula. To them it was leftovers, but to us it was magical. WSJ: Uglydolls switched to licensing last year from wholesale distribution. Why? Mr. Horvath: We realized that fans around the world weren't seeing us as a plush-toy company but as a brand like Paul Frank
or Hello Kitty. Many of our fans treat their Uglies like they're part of the family. We've gotten pictures of fans at the dinner table, and there's an Ugly with its own chair. WSJ: What steps have you taken to stave off competitors? Mr. Horvath: From the get-go we poured resources and money into protecting ourselves, from design patents to registering copyrights and trademarks in every country and language. As we create each character, we go through the same steps. You have to plan for ultimate success from the first day. You don't want to play catch-up later. WSJ: The Uglydolls brand is on stationery, umbrellas, bags and more. How do you choose new product categories? Mr. Horvath: It's not really about the category but the method of execution. We have always been dedicated to working with the best of the best—and our fans know that—so there is a very positive association for those who work with us. Licensing at its best is about creating genuine, exciting and memorable experiences for your audience. WSJ: What advice do you have for entrepreneurs looking to build a brand? Mr. Horvath: Don't chase after the hot thing. If it's hot somebody has already done it. You have to come up with something from scratch. It's going to have to be your own spin on a theme. There's a big difference between making a better product and building a brand. Better products work great, but a brand means something to people. Write to Sarah E.
