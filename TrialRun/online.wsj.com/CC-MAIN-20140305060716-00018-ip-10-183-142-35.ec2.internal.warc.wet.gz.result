Oct. 25, 2013 12:47 a.m. ET
BOSTON—Moments before Game 2 of the World Series, Fenway Park was awash in nostalgia. Seven members of the 2004 champion Red Sox threw out ceremonial first pitches. And with Boston hosting the St. Louis Cardinals, the team those Red Sox swept in the 2004 World Series, comparisons to this year's team were inevitable. "It's a team that looks pretty much like us," former Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez
said. Martinez was praying, he said, for these Red Sox to "repeat the story." View Slideshow
Jacoby Ellsbury of the Boston Red Sox breaks his bat against the St. Louis Cardinals during Game Two of the 2013 World Series.
Getty Images But by beating Boston, 4-2, on Thursday night, the Cardinals at least guaranteed this much: History will not repeat itself. At least, not in the lopsided way it happened nine years ago. A one-run Boston lead vanished in a span of seconds in the seventh inning, when the Cardinals scored three runs thanks in part to two Red Sox errors. And with that, the Cardinals sent the series back to St. Louis tied at one game apiece. It was the Cardinals' first World Series win over Boston since 1967. "The margin for error is really slim this time of year," said Red Sox pitcher John Lackey, who allowed three runs in 6 1/3 innings. "We kind of let one go tonight." One night after the Cardinals gift-wrapped Game 1 for Boston with a slew of defensive gaffes, the Red Sox returned the favor. When Matt Carpenter's sac fly to left field tied the game in the seventh, the throw to the plate bounced away from catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, sending Jon Jay sprinting from second to third. Red Sox reliever Craig Breslow, backing up Saltalamacchia, retrieved the ball and fired a throw toward third, but it sailed into left field, allowing Jay to score the go-ahead run. Carlos Beltran, playing with a severely bruised rib, followed with an RBI single, and the Red Sox never recovered. "The errant throw, that's the one in looking back, I'm sure Craig would like to have that ball back and hold it and shut down that inning right there," Red Sox manager John Farrell said. "It was uncharacteristic of the way we've taken care of the baseball this year." The Red Sox boast a relentless lineup that led the majors in scoring during the regular season. But they didn't hit as well as the 8-1 score in Game 1 would suggest. According to the statistical website Fangraphs, it was the first time a team scored eight runs in a postseason game while reaching base in only 25% of its plate appearances. When the Cardinals' defense returned to competence Thursday, Boston's offensive struggles became more pronounced. The Red Sox finished with just four hits and put runners in scoring position only three times. And the heart of their order is about to be diminished by the lack of a designated hitter for three games in St. Louis. Boston will have to choose between starting slugger David Ortiz at first base or benching him in favor of Mike Napoli. Farrell said he will likely start Ortiz, who homered Thursday, at first in Game 3. "How we go from there, we'll go through it day to day," Farrell said. "But we're going to lose one of our middle-of-the-order bats, and that's understood going in." Before the game, Martinez joined 2004 Sox alumni Jason Varitek, Kevin Millar, Mike Timlin, Keith Foulke, Trot Nixon and Derek Lowe in front of the mound. Ortiz delivered balls to each of them for a rare feat in baseball pomp: seven simultaneous ceremonial first pitches. In an interview room above the Red Sox clubhouse, Martinez lavished praise on the current group as only he could. "They play the game like a wolf pack," he said. "That's how I describe the whole team, like a wolf pack. They draw a plan to kill and to feed everybody." Lowe, sitting beside him, interrupted: "What are we talking about again right now? You got me lost." Undaunted, Martinez continued, "Because they go after the kill. A little baby animal that's hurt or something like that, the easiest catch." But if Cardinals starter Michael Wacha, a 21-year-old rookie, could be considered one of baseball's baby animals, he was anything but easy prey. Having entered the game with a streak of 13 2/3 scoreless postseason innings, Wacha blanked the Sox for five more before serving up a two-run blast to Ortiz in the sixth. It was one of only three hits he allowed in six innings. "I didn't have my best stuff tonight," Wacha said. "Definitely a little bit more wild. Didn't have the command. I tried to let my defense be behind me and pitch to contact, and they made some great plays." When Ortiz knocked Wacha's 3-2 changeup over the Green Monster, it put Boston ahead, 2-1. But once the Cardinals regained the lead in the seventh, their bullpen took care of the rest. Carlos Martinez threw two scoreless innings and Trevor Rosenthal earned the save in the ninth. A series that was on the verge of tilting heavily in Boston's favor is now guaranteed to go at least five games. Given that both teams led their respective leagues in wins, that's not a shock. "We fully expected this to be a hard-fought series," Farrell said. "It's not surprising that we're in the position we are in." Write to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.com Email

The Case Against Corporate Social Responsibility
The idea that companies have a duty to address social ills is not just flawed, argues Aneel Karnani. It also makes it more likely that we'll ignore the real solutions to these problems.

August 23, 2010
Can companies do well by doing good? Yes—sometimes. Journal Report Read the complete WSJ Executive Adviser report . WSJ Podcast Hear Aneel Karnani, Professor of Strategy at the University of Michigan's Stephen M Ross School of Business, discuss why the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility is flawed .
But the idea that companies have a responsibility to act in the public interest and will profit from doing so is fundamentally flawed. Large companies now routinely claim that they aren't in business just for the profits, that they're also intent on serving some larger social purpose. They trumpet their efforts to produce healthier foods or more fuel-efficient vehicles, conserve energy and other resources in their operations, or otherwise make the world a better place. Influential institutions like the Academy of Management and the United Nations, among many others, encourage companies to pursue such strategies. It's not surprising that this idea has won over so many people—it's a very appealing proposition. You can have your cake and eat it too! But it's an illusion, and a potentially dangerous one. Very simply, in cases where private profits and public interests are aligned, the idea of corporate social responsibility is irrelevant: Companies that simply do everything they can to boost profits will end up increasing social welfare. In circumstances in which profits and social welfare are in direct opposition, an appeal to corporate social responsibility will almost always be ineffective, because executives are unlikely to act voluntarily in the public interest and against shareholder interests. Irrelevant or ineffective, take your pick. But it's worse than that. The danger is that a focus on social responsibility will delay or discourage more-effective measures to enhance social welfare in those cases where profits and the public good are at odds. As society looks to companies to address these problems, the real solutions may be ignored. Well and Good To get a better fix on the irrelevance or ineffectiveness of corporate social responsibility efforts, let's first look at situations where profits and social welfare are in synch. Enlarge Image
James Steinberg Consider the market for healthier food. Fast-food outlets have profited by expanding their offerings to include salads and other options designed to appeal to health-conscious consumers. Other companies have found new sources of revenue in low-fat, whole-grain and other types of foods that have grown in popularity. Social welfare is improved. Everybody wins. Similarly, auto makers have profited from responding to consumer demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles, a plus for the environment. And many companies have boosted profits while enhancing social welfare by reducing their energy consumption and thus their costs. But social welfare isn't the driving force behind these trends. Healthier foods and more fuel-efficient vehicles didn't become so common until they became profitable for their makers. Energy conservation didn't become so important to many companies until energy became more costly. These companies are benefiting society while acting in their own interests; social activists urging them to change their ways had little impact. It is the relentless maximization of profits, not a commitment to social responsibility, that has proved to be a boon to the public in these cases. Unfortunately, not all companies take advantage of such opportunities, and in those cases both social welfare and profits suffer. These companies have one of two problems: Their executives are either incompetent or are putting their own interests ahead of the company's long-term financial interests. For instance, an executive might be averse to any risk, including the development of new products, that might jeopardize the short-term financial performance of the company and thereby affect his compensation, even if taking that risk would improve the company's longer-term prospects. An appeal to social responsibility won't solve either of those problems. Pressure from shareholders for sustainable growth in profitability can. It can lead to incompetent managers being replaced and to a realignment of incentives for executives, so that their compensation is tied more directly to the company's long-term success. When There's a Choice Still, the fact is that while companies sometimes can do well by doing good, more often they can't. Because in most cases, doing what's best for society means sacrificing profits. For Further Reading Related articles from MIT Sloan Management Review Does It Pay To Be Good? By Remi Trudel and June Cotte (Winter 2009) In surveys, customers have long claimed that they'd pay more for ethically produced goods. But is that what happens when they actually buy things? New experiments offer answers. What Every CEO Needs to Know About Nonmarket Strategy By David Bach and David Bruce Allen (Spring 2010) In a global economy, sustained competitive advantage arises from tackling social, political and environmental issues as part of a corporate strategy—not just pursuing business as usual. Beyond Selfishness By Henry Mintzberg, Robert Simons and Kunal Basu (Fall 2002) A syndrome of selfishness, built on a series of half-truths, has taken hold of our corporations and our societies, as well as our minds. This calculus of glorified self-interest and the fabrications upon which it is based must be challenged. How to Do Well and Do Good By Rosabeth Moss Kanter (Fall 2010) The key to achieving both of those goals together? Integrate societal benefits with company strategy. Using Corporate Social Responsibility to Win the War for Talent By C.B. Bhattacharya, Sankar Sen and Daniel Korschun (Winter 2008) Research indicates that there are five steps that can help business leaders increase CSR's effectiveness as a lever for talent management.
This is true for most of society's pervasive and persistent problems; if it weren't, those problems would have been solved long ago by companies seeking to maximize their profits. A prime example is the pollution caused by manufacturing. Reducing that pollution is costly to the manufacturers, and that eats into profits. Poverty is another obvious example. Companies could pay their workers more and charge less for their products, but their profits would suffer. So now what? Should executives in these situations heed the call for corporate social responsibility even without the allure of profiting from it? You can argue that they should. But you shouldn't expect that they will. Executives are hired to maximize profits; that is their responsibility to their company's shareholders. Even if executives wanted to forgo some profit to benefit society, they could expect to lose their jobs if they tried—and be replaced by managers who would restore profit as the top priority. The movement for corporate social responsibility is in direct opposition, in such cases, to the movement for better corporate governance, which demands that managers fulfill their fiduciary duty to act in the shareholders' interest or be relieved of their responsibilities. That's one reason so many companies talk a great deal about social responsibility but do nothing—a tactic known as greenwashing. Managers who sacrifice profit for the common good also are in effect imposing a tax on their shareholders and arbitrarily deciding how that money should be spent. In that sense they are usurping the role of elected government officials, if only on a small scale. Privately owned companies are a different story. If an owner-operated business chooses to accept diminished profit in order to enhance social welfare, that decision isn't being imposed on shareholders. And, of course, it is admirable and desirable for the leaders of successful public companies to use some of their personal fortune for charitable purposes, as many have throughout history and many do now. But those leaders shouldn't presume to pursue their philanthropic goals with shareholder money. Indeed, many shareholders themselves use significant amounts of the money they make from their investments to help fund charities or otherwise improve social welfare. This is not to say, of course, that companies should be left free to pursue the greatest possible profits without regard for the social consequences. But, appeals to corporate social responsibility are not an effective way to strike a balance between profits and the public good. The Power of Regulation So how can that balance best be struck? Enlarge Image
James Steinberg The ultimate solution is government regulation. Its greatest appeal is that it is binding. Government has the power to enforce regulation. No need to rely on anyone's best intentions. But government regulation isn't perfect, and it can even end up reducing public welfare because of its cost or inefficiency. The government also may lack the resources and competence to design and administer appropriate regulations, particularly for complex industries requiring much specialized knowledge. And industry groups might find ways to influence regulation to the point where it is ineffective or even ends up benefiting the industry at the expense of the general population. Outright corruption can make the situation even worse. What's more, all the problems of government failure are exacerbated in developing countries with weak and often corrupt governments. Still, with all their faults, governments are a far more effective protector of the public good than any campaign for corporate social responsibility. Watchdogs and Advocates Civil society also plays a role in constraining corporate behavior that reduces social welfare, acting as a watchdog and advocate. Various nonprofit organizations and movements provide a voice for a wide variety of social, political, environmental, ethnic, cultural and community interests. The Rainforest Action Network, for example, is an organization that agitates, often quite effectively, for environmental protection and sustainability. Its website states, "Our campaigns leverage public opinion and consumer pressure to turn the public stigma of environmental destruction into a business nightmare for any American company that refuses to adopt responsible environmental policies." That's quite a different approach from trying to convince executives that they should do what's best for society because it's the right thing to do and won't hurt their bottom line. Overall, though, such activism has a mixed track record, and it can't be relied on as the primary mechanism for imposing constraints on corporate behavior—especially in most developing countries, where civil society lacks adequate resources to exert much influence and there is insufficient awareness of public issues among the population. Self-Control Self-regulation is another alternative, but it suffers from the same drawback as the concept of corporate social responsibility: Companies are unlikely to voluntarily act in the public interest at the expense of shareholder interests. But self-regulation can be useful. It tends to promote good practices and target specific problems within industries, impose lower compliance costs on businesses than government regulation, and offer quick, low-cost dispute-resolution procedures. Self-regulation can also be more flexible than government regulation, allowing it to respond more effectively to changing circumstances. The challenge is to design self-regulation in a manner that emphasizes transparency and accountability, consistent with what the public expects from government regulation. It is up to the government to ensure that any self-regulation meets that standard. And the government must be prepared to step in and impose its own regulations if the industry fails to police itself effectively. Financial Calculation In the end, social responsibility is a financial calculation for executives, just like any other aspect of their business. The only sure way to influence corporate decision making is to impose an unacceptable cost—regulatory mandates, taxes, punitive fines, public embarrassment—on socially unacceptable behavior. Pleas for corporate social responsibility will be truly embraced only by those executives who are smart enough to see that doing the right thing is a byproduct of their pursuit of profit. And that renders such pleas pointless. Dr. Karnani is an associate professor of strategy at the University of Michigan's Stephen M. Ross School of Business. He can be reached at reports@wsj.com.

WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court nullified a core provision of the Voting Rights Act in an ideologically divided ruling that eroded a landmark of the civil-rights era and threw the issue into the lap of a gridlocked Congress. In a 5-4 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts said Jim-Crow era discrimination no longer justified requiring a group of mostly Southern states to seek Washington's approval before changing election practices. Joined by the court's other conservatives, he said the court had to act to uphold states'...

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham wants more visas for the meat industry, a major employer in his state. Sen.
