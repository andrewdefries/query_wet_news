Jenkins: Two Puddings, No Theme
Barack Obama was in better form for his second presidential debate with Mitt Romney, but the president's political cynicism remained unchanged in this inconclusive battle of the soundbites.
By
Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.
Updated Oct. 17, 2012 12:29 a.m. ET
Barack Obama, if the truth be known, is a bit of a political cynic. He didn't mind that his way to the Senate was cleared by divorce-related scandals, flogged by a friendly Chicago media, that drove his two most potent rivals, one Democratic and the other Republican, out of the race. In his presidential campaign of 2008, amid the bouquets of flowery rhetoric, he offered few crunchy policy commitments and no analysis of the...

The housing market has turned—at last. The U.S. finally has moved beyond attention-grabbing predictions from housing "experts" that housing is bottoming. The numbers are now convincing. Nearly seven years after the housing bubble burst, most indexes of house prices are bending up. "We finally saw some rising home prices," S&P's David Blitzer said a few weeks ago as he reported the first monthly increase in the slow-moving S&P/Case-Shiller house-price data after seven months of declines. The U.S. finally has moved beyond attention-grabbing predictions from housing "experts" that housing is bottoming. The numbers are now convincing, according to David Wessel on The News Hub.

Related Home Builders Beef Up on Cash to Gird for Next Wave 7/10/12 Housing Healing in More U.S. Cities 7/9/12 Number of the Week: Has Housing Bottomed? 7/7/12 Outlook: Housing Ends Slide but Faces a Long Bottom 4/29/12 Stunned Home Buyers Find Bidding Wars Are Back 4/27/12 Journal Community Nearly 10% more existing homes were sold in May than in the same month a year earlier, many purchased by investors who plan to rent them for now and sell them later, an important sign of an inflection point. In something of a surprise, the inventory of existing homes for sale has fallen close to the normal level of six months' worth despite all the foreclosed homes that lenders own. The fraction of homes that are vacant is at its lowest level since 2006. The reduced inventory of unsold homes is key, says Mark Fleming, chief economist at CoreLogic, a housing data-analysis firm. For the past couple of years, house prices have risen in the spring and then slumped; the declining supply of houses for sale is reason to believe that won't happen again this year, he says. Builders began work on 26% more single-family homes in May 2012 than the depressed levels of May 2011. The stock of unsold newly built homes is back to 2005 levels. In each of the past four quarters, housing construction has added to economic growth. In the first quarter, it accounted for 0.4 percentage points of the meager 1.9% growth rate. "Even with the overall economy slowing," Wells Fargo Securities economists said, cautiously, in a note to clients, "the budding recovery in the housing market appears to be gradually gaining momentum." Economists aren't always right, but on this at least they agree: A new Wall Street Journal survey of forecasters found 44 believe the housing market has reached its bottom; only three don't. (The full results of the Journal's July survey will be released at 2pm ET) Housing is still far from healthy despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to resuscitate it by helping to push mortgage rates to extraordinary lows: 3.62% for a 30-year loan, according to Freddie Mac's latest survey. Single-family housing starts, though up, remain 60% below the 2002 pre-bubble pace. Americans' equity in homes is $2 trillion, or 25%, less than it was in 2002 and half what it was at the peak. More than one in every four mortgage borrowers still has a loan bigger than the value of the house, though rising home prices are reducing that fraction slowly. View Graphics
Still, the upturn in housing is a milestone, a particularly welcome one amid a distressing dearth of jobs. For some time, housing has been one of the biggest causes of economic weakness. It has now—barely—moved to the plus side. "A little tail wind is a lot better than a headwind," says economist Chip Case, the "Case" in Case-Shiller. From here on, housing is unlikely to drag the U.S. economy down further. It will instead reflect the strength or weakness of the overall economy: The more jobs, the more confident Americans are about keeping their jobs, the more they are willing to buy houses. "Manufacturing had led growth and construction had lagged," JPMorgan Chase economists said last week."Now the roles are reversed: Manufacturing growth has slowed as private construction comes to life." Plenty could go wrong. The biggest threat is a large shadow inventory of unsold homes, homes which owners won't put on the market because they are underwater, homes that will be foreclosed eventually and homes owned by lenders. They have been trickling onto the market, slowed in part by government efforts to delay foreclosures; a flood could reverse the recent rise in prices. Or the still-dysfunctional mortgage market could get worse. Or overly zealous regulators or a post-election change in government policy could unsettle mortgage lenders or home buyers. But the housing bust is over. Write to David Wessel at capital@wsj.com Email

The tax changes included in the bill hashed out between the White House and congressional Republicans Monday includes the first increases in top income-tax rates in nearly two decades. They also set new thresholds for determining who is "rich," while leaving most people's tax rates unchanged.

Biography
Updated May 26, 2013 2:19 p.m. ET
LONDON—A key suspect in last week's brutal killing of a soldier here was detained in Kenya in 2010 and deported to the U.K., people familiar with the case said on Sunday, a revelation that came as government officials faced more questions about whether British security services could have stopped the attack. Michael Adebolajo,
one of two primary suspects in custody in the gruesome stabbing death of 25-year-old soldier Lee Rigby,
traveled to Kenya in 2010 but was detained and sent back to the U.K. A former United Nations monitoring official familiar with the case said on Sunday that, while in Kenya, Mr. Adebolajo met with family and associates of a firebrand cleric who had connections with a Somali militant group. Lyn Rigby, left, mother of slain British soldier Lee Rigby, looks at floral tributes left outside the Woolwich barracks in southeast London on Sunday.
Reuters "We can confirm a British national was arrested in Kenya in 2010. [the U.K. Foreign Office] provided consular assistance as normal for British nationals," said a Foreign Office spokeswoman on Sunday. Details about Mr. Adebolajo's trip to Kenya emerged as London's Metropolitan Police said they arrested two men, ages 24 and 28, at a residential address in southeast London late Saturday, while a 21-year-old man was arrested on the street. Two of the men were taken into custody with the use of a Taser but weren't hospitalized. Police didn't identify any of the three, who were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. The arrests are the latest in the wake of Mr. Rigby's killing in London's Woolwich district on Wednesday. Witnesses said the victim was attacked by two men with knives and a cleaver on a city street early that afternoon. Two men—now identified by people familiar with the matter as 28-year-old Mr. Adebolajo and 22-year-old Michael Adebowale
—were shot and arrested by police that day and remain hospitalized and in custody. British officials face growing questions over their past interactions with Messrs. Adebolajo and Adebowale, who officials familiar with the matter say were previously known to the country's security services. The U.K. government declined to comment on reports that Mr. Adebolajo had tried to enter Somalia to join militants. In a television appearance on Sunday, Home Secretary Theresa May
declined to discuss the specifics of the case or media reports that intelligence officers had previously approached one of the suspects potentially to recruit him as an informant. But she said the security services gather intelligence in a variety of ways and "they will approach individuals from time to time." Ms. May praised the work of the intelligence officials and the police in countering terrorism but said "we will look to see if there are any lessons to be learned." The U.K. parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee has said it would scrutinize what intelligence officials knew about the suspects behind the Woolwich killing. She added that there now are about 500 officers and others working on the investigation, which is being led by London's Metropolitan Police. British Prime Minister David Cameron
announced a new task force late Saturday on "tackling" extremism and radicalization. The group will examine topics such as disrupting extremist activity and ways to challenge extremist ideology. The group will include government officials representing the legal system, education and religious communities. Mr. Adebolajo's 2010 journey to Kenya will likely become a major focus. The emerging portrait of the suspects, both of Nigerian descent but raised in Britain, indicates that they converted to Islam in recent years, said officials and other people familiar with the men. Mr. Adebolajo, at least, was known to have participated in demonstrations. Muthui Kariuki,
a spokesman for the Kenyan government, on Sunday said the suspect "used a different name to come into the country. He arrived in the country as Michael Olemindis Ndemolajo. That's the man we arrested. We discovered he was a British citizen of Nigerian extraction, and we handed him over to British security forces. Until the past few days, we didn't know of the name Adebolajo, because the man we had in our records was Ndemolajo." Matt Bryden,
director of Sahan Research, a Nairobi-based think tank, and former coordinator of the U.N. Monitoring Group, a group mandated by the U.N. Security Council to monitor threats to peace and security in Somalia and Eritrea, said Mr. Adebolajo entered Kenya in November 2010, and was deported in the same month. Mr. Bryden was at the time with the U.N. Monitoring Group, which investigates the peace and security situation in Somalia and Eritrea. He recalls the case and said Mr. Adebolajo was detained on an island off the Kenyan coast, while traveling by boat, in the direction of the Somalia border. He and his associates denied they intended to travel to Somalia, and told the court they were on the island for a cultural festival. Their destination hasn't been confirmed. While he was in Kenya, Mr. Adebolajo met with family and associates of Aboud Rogo, a firebrand Muslim cleric based in Mombasa, Mr. Bryden said. Mr. Rogo was an outspoken supporter of al-Shabaab, the Somalian Islamist militant group known to train extremist fighters. Mr. Rogo was shot and killed by police in 2012, an incident that sparked riots among his young Muslim supporters in the coastal city of Mombasa. Mr. Rogo was the ideological leader of the Muslim Youth Centre, or MYC. He mobilized resources, recruits and other forms of support for al-Shabaab's activities in Kenya and Somalia, according to the reports issued by the monitoring group in 2011 and 2012. Mr. Adebolajo also met with activists and supporters of the MYC, an organization now known as Al Hijra, said Mr. Bryden, who cited sources who were part of Mr. Rogo's entourage, and have since joined the MYC. The authenticity of the testimony the suspect and his associates gave to the Kenyan court was compromised by the fact that he and his associates had been kept in a cell together before interrogation, and their appearance in court, Mr. Bryden said. "It compromised the opportunity for the Kenyan authorities to proceed with investigations," he said. "British security services were made aware of these events before Adebolajo's deportation back to the U.K., but such incidents are fairly routine, and there was little if anything to indicate that he or his associates were capable of the acts they currently stand accused of." "I don't think the British security services could have done more to prevent Lee Rigby's murder," said Mr. Bryden. "But this episode certainly underscores the role that Al-Hijra, al-Shabaab and other jihadist movements in Africa have played in radicalizing travelers from the West, and the threat that they continue to represent." Al-Shabaab took root in a chaotic Somalia, drawing al Qaeda-linked fighters to a civil war against a transitional government that controlled only a small part of East African nation's capital, Mogadishu. Some of those al Qaeda-backed fighters sought to use Somalia as a staging ground for attacks against foreign targets. In 2010—the same year Mr. Adebolajo was reportedly detained in Kenya—al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for a multiple-bomb attack in nearby Uganda that killed roughly 80 people, many of them watching the televised soccer World Cup finals in bars and restaurants. Since then, African peacekeepers and international donors have redoubled their efforts to defeat al-Shabaab. In the past year, African Union peacekeepers have driven al-Shabaab out of Mogadishu and its port stronghold of Kismayo. This month, foreign leaders meeting in London pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to help Somalia's newly elected democratic government recover from the civil war. Despite strong support from foreign allies, the lingering al-Shabaab insurgency still poses a threat to Somalia's new democratic government. Militants control parts of Somalia's southern countryside, and have continued to carry out a spate of car bombings in the capital. The probe into Mr. Rigby's death has resulted in numerous other arrests in recent days. On Friday night, Abu Nusaybah,
a friend of Mr. Adebolajo, was arrested outside the studios of the British Broadcasting Corp., the Associated Press reported the BBC as saying. Mr. Nusaybah had just given a television interview in which he said Mr. Adebolajo was radicalized and alleged that British security services had tried to recruit Mr. Adebolajo. Police confirmed a 31-year-old man was arrested Friday night in London and was being questioned, the AP reported, adding that Mr. Nusaybah's account couldn't immediately be verified. Mr. Nusaybah earlier said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal via the Twitter account he is known to use that Mr. Adebolajo "was always hurt if he heard of Muslims being harmed" anywhere in the world.

By
Ian Talley
Updated Feb. 16, 2013 3:06 p.m. ET
MOSCOW—The world's largest economies took a step toward common global guidelines for exchange-rate policies with a pledge Saturday to refrain from targeting their currency policies to gain a competitive trading advantage. The pledge, in a statement produced by finance ministers and central bankers from Group of 20 nations following two days of meetings here, marked the first time the group had agreed to such an explicit guideline on...

U.S. stocks pulled back 3.6% before rebounding late last week, but the bigger correction is in the ongoing adjustment to our assumptions. For months, investors have operated under the blissful notion that a good economic report is good news (it shows the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is working), while a bad report also is good news (it keeps the monetary medicine coming). That mind-set is rapidly changing. Global government bonds have just absorbed their seventh-worst month in 28 years, while bond funds suffered their biggest weekly redemption since the financial crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average nearly ended a 110-day run above its 50-day average, although stocks' droop felt more like a buyers' strike than a flight from risk -- selling wasn't heavy, and financials remain by far this quarter's top sector. NO ONE THINKS THE FED will back off its bond-buying binge just yet: Bank of America Merrill Lynch's economists think that monthly job creation must consistently exceed 250,000 before the Fed scales back, or slump below 90,000 for the Fed to pump more money into the system. Neither is happening -- the U.S. last month added 175,000 jobs. Yet investors have begun dreading the day when the Fed changes its tune, and they're also waiting for the economy to catch up to stocks' 31% surge over the past year. Moderating expectations will help the market. For now, analysts seem to have cut their projections far enough, and profit forecasts are being revised upward for the first time in 13 months, notes Thomson Reuters. U.S. manufacturing shrank in May, but the service sector kept expanding. Global manufacturing also rebounded from a four-month low, with new orders -- a leading indicator -- pointing to a pickup ahead. The willingness, no matter how gradual and skittish, to look beyond the easy money also is a healthy turn. "We keep feeding this tiger to keep it quiet, but the bigger the Fed's balance sheet gets, the bigger the problem will be when the Fed eventually needs to tighten," says David Kelly, chief global strategist of JPMorgan Funds, in a conference call with clients last week. An orderly rise in interest rates mirrors economic improvements, and shouldn't threaten stocks until the 10-year Treasury yield starts poking above 5%. Still, Kelly thinks it's important to start positioning portfolios for rising interest rates. Every one percentage-point increase in rates -- say, if the 10-year yield were to climb from 2.16% to 3.16% -- could mete out losses of 7.9% for 10-year Treasuries, 4.1% for treasury inflation-protected securities, and 3.3% for corporate bonds. Kelly advocates underweighting fixed-income in general, but within bonds, leaning more on convertibles and high-yield, which hold up better as rates rise. Among stocks, a one-point rise in long rates could translate into gains averaging 2.1% for materials, 1.5% for technology, 1.3% for energy, and 1% for consumer discretionary, but losses of 1.5% for staples, 2% for health care, and 2.3% for utilities. Stocks also continue to look attractive on valuations, Kelly adds. U.S. corporations' real earnings yield -- essentially the inverse of the price/earnings ratio -- recently was at 5.6%, well above its 50-year average near 4.3% and the 1.1% real yield offered by 10-year Treasuries. The U.S. fiscal drag also is being offset by recovering wealth: Americans' debt payments as a percentage of disposable income have shrunk from 14.1% in 2007 to 10.4%, and rallying stocks and real estate have helped household net worth rebound to $70.3 trillion last quarter, surpassing 2007's peak of $67.4 trillion. It also helps that stocks and the dollar are rising in lock step this year, and the two haven't been this intertwined since 2002. While overseas profits could suffer when translated back into the strengthening greenback, "we believe the positives of a strong dollar -- stronger economy, lower commodity prices, foreign capital inflows, etc. -- outweigh any negative impact," argues Paul Hickey of Bespoke Investment Group. In fact, prior stretches of tight correlation between the two, especially with both rising, have led to average stock market gains of 7.7% six months later and 13.8% a year out. Technology, financials, and industrials have tended to outperform when stocks and the buck ascend in unison. MEANWHILE, INCESSANT FRETTING about Fed tapering has given investors pause. Credit Suisse's latest survey of global investors showed 88% who believed stocks will be the best asset class over the next two years, but only 65% who said the same for the next three months, a sign of short-term hesitation. And just over 35% of U.S. private pension assets are in equities, below the long-term average near 44%. Money managers are still playing catch-up. Roughly 68% of fund managers are trailing their benchmarks this year, with 32% lagging by a gap of 2.5 percentage points or more, notes Thomas Lee, JPMorgan's equity strategist. Lee thinks funds will look to buy the dip and pad positions, especially in technology, financials, and health care. He screened for stocks in these sectors with dividend yields above 10-year Treasuries', that fetch less than 20 times 2014 profits, and that are favored by the firm's analysts.
