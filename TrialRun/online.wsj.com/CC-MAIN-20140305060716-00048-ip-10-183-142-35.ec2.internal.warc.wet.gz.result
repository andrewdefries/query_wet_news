Boise Cascade Prices Beefed-Up IPO Above Expectations NEW YORK--The IPO of Boise Cascade LLC left the gate strong, as the plywood maker priced its $248 million deal at $21 a share--above a range that had already been raised Tuesday morning. Boise Cascade late Tuesday priced the 11.8 million shares to be sold in its initial public offering Wednesday, according to an underwriter familiar with the deal's terms. It is the second housing-related company to list in 2013 and comes to market during a wide rebound in the sector. Earlier Tuesday, Boise Cascade raised the deal's expected price range to $18 to $20, according to updated documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Initial filings had outlined an expected range of $16 to $18 a share, or a maximum deal value of about $212 million. The company will make its market debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BCC. Boise Cascade manufactures plywood and other wood products used mostly in residential construction, repair and remodeling projects. Its customers include wholesalers, home-improvement centers and retail lumberyards. Recovering home prices and sales have spurred profits and stock prices of home builders, as well as home-improvement retailers and building-materials companies. Recent strength in these segments also has helped attract new issues into the IPO market. Last week, TRI Pointe Homes Inc. (TPH) became the first home builder to launch an IPO in more than eight years. Shares are up about 7% since their debut Thursday. Another builder, Taylor Morrison Home Corp., in December disclosed its plans for an IPO valued at as much as $250 million. A date for its IPO hasn't been specified. In addition to producing its wood products, Boise Cascade operates a building-materials distribution business. Its distribution segment, which accounted for roughly 27% of its pretax earnings in the 12 months that ended in September, sells its own wood products as well as other materials from third-party suppliers. Private-equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners LLC took control of Boise Cascade in 2004, paying $3.7 billion to OfficeMax Inc. (OMX), which continues to hold about 20% of the company. Together, Madison Dearborn and OfficeMax will retain control of about 70% of Boise Cascade's shares outstanding after the IPO, according to the filing. The company's revenue climbed 22% to $2.1 billion in the first nine months of last year, and it swung to a profit of $40.2 million from a loss of $32.6 million a year earlier. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are leading Boise Cascade's IPO. Write to Chris Dieterich at christopher.dieterich@dowjones.com; Email

Do you remember the debates over the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare? Now that repeal of the law has become a major campaign issue, it may be helpful to remember why Congress passed it in the first place. Early in 2010, as the climactic votes neared, a parade of the legislation's defenders—from the House, Senate and Obama administration—appeared across the media. All had the same message: pre-existing conditions. They named the names of families "victimized" by companies that had refused to sell them insurance, had canceled their coverage or had refused to pay their medical bills. The message surely resonated, but how many people have actually been affected since the law passed? The Affordable Care Act established a federally funded risk pool—the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan—that allows individuals with such disqualifying conditions to buy a policy for the same premium a healthy person would pay. About 82,000 people have signed up as of July 31, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's statehealthfacts.org. That is not a misprint. Out of a population of more than 300 million, some 82,000 have the problem that was cited as the principal reason for spending $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years and in the process turning the entire health-care system upside down. The risk pool surely comes as welcome relief to those who need it. A lot of them are really sick and are running up expensive medical bills. But the three-year cost is about $5 billion, as budgeted in the Affordable Care Act—a tiny fraction of the law's overall burden. Nevertheless, the federal risk pool will be closed down in 2014, when ObamaCare will begin prohibiting insurance companies from charging premiums based on the health conditions of applicants. Mitt Romney has vowed to repeal ObamaCare if he is elected president, but his plan for addressing pre-existing conditions is similar to it in some respects. Mr. Romney says he would require insurers to ignore pre-existing conditions for anyone who has been insured continuously for a certain period of time, such as through an employer's plan. But when insurers are forced to charge the same premium to all applicants, regardless of expected health-care costs, prices will be wrong for everyone—and both buyers and sellers of health-care policies will have perverse incentives. Enlarge Image
Corbis On the buyer's side, healthy people who are overcharged will underinsure, buying less coverage than they otherwise would. They may even decide to go without insurance, since the ObamaCare penalties for being uninsured are weak and people can always buy a policy after they get sick. People with expensive health problems will overinsure, buying more generous coverage than they otherwise would. Insurers, on the other hand, will try to sell policies to the healthy, on whom they expect to make a profit, while avoiding the unhealthy, on whom they expect to incur a loss,—and they will change the design of their plans to accomplish this goal. Preventive care and wellness checkups with no deductible or copayment, for example, will attract and keep the healthy; insurers may even provide memberships in health clubs. But failure to include the best cancer-care center or the top heart clinic in a plan's network will discourage the sick from enrolling. Insurers may also underprovide for unhealthy people by failing to include the latest cancer drugs in their offerings. These same incentives are present in the current system, but most people have insurance brokers or employers acting as their protectors. In a few years, however, the brokers will likely leave the market altogether and many employers will drop their coverage. Along the way, the federal government will put enormous pressure on insurers to keep their costs down. Then you will be on your own, facing a system that has no interest in spending money on you. On health insurance generally, Mitt Romney surely has the better approach. He would give the same tax relief to individually purchased insurance as to employer-provided coverage. That would put portable insurance (owned by the individual) on equal footing with group insurance that must be forfeited when people change jobs. Portability would alleviate the problem for individuals who change or lose their jobs but have medical conditions. Also, repealing ObamaCare would mean that people wouldn't be able to game the system by waiting to buy insurance until after they get sick. For those who have not been continuously insured, Mr. Romney favors risk pools. This is a cheaper and less destructive solution to the problem of pre-existing conditions. But here the danger is that risk pools must be structured judiciously, lest they also encourage the healthy to remain uninsured. There is an even better idea: to insure yourself against the possibility of becoming uninsurable, as suggested by economists including the University of Chicago's John Cochrane on this page in April. Under this approach, policies would be guaranteed to be renewable and include the right to buy another policy in the future. If your health condition worsens, a new insurer would be free to charge you a higher premium. But the old insurer would pay the extra premium caused by the change in your health status. Mr. Goodman is president of the National Center for Policy Analysis and author of "Priceless: Curing the Healthcare Crisis" (Independent Institute, 2012). Email

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that U.S. cities and counties adopt enhanced safety measures for parades, after concluding that Midland, Texas, and the organizers of a parade for wounded veterans were most to blame for a deadly rail accident there last year. The federal agency issued its recommendation when it announced the results of its investigation into the Nov. 15 accident, in which a Union Pacific freight train traveling about 62 miles an hour collided with a parade float carrying...

BRUSSELS—North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers meeting in Brussels received optimistic assessments that agreements with Afghanistan would be in place in time for the U.S. and other foreign forces to maintain their presence in the country after 2014. The 28-nation alliance is planning to end its combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of next year, limiting its role after that to training and advising Afghan forces. The...

Cap and trade may be flopping around like a dying fish in Congress, but the Obama Administration isn't about to let the annoyance of democratic consent interfere with its climate ambitions. Almost as bad is the new evidence that it understands how damaging its carbon regulations and taxes will be and is pressing ahead anyway. The White House is currently reviewing the Environmental Protection Agency's April "endangerment finding" that as a matter of law CO2 is a pollutant that threatens the public's health and must therefore be subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. Such a rulemaking would let the EPA impose the ossified command-and-control regulatory approach of the 1970s across the entire economy, even if Democrats never get around to passing a cap-and-tax bill. Yet a curious twist is buried in the EPA's draft rule. The trade press is reporting that the agency thinks it enjoys the discretion to target the new rules only to major industrial sources of carbon emissions, such as power plants, refineries, factories and the like. This so-called "tailoring rule" essentially rewrites clear statutory language of the Clean Air Act by bureaucratic decree. Because the act was never written to apply to today's climate neuroses, clean-air regulation is based on an extremely low threshold for CO2 emissions that will automatically transfer hundreds of thousands of businesses into the EPA's ambit. The agency is required to regulate sources that emit more than 250 tons of a given air pollutant annually, which may be reasonable for conventional pollutants like NOX or SOX. But this is a very low limit for ubiquitous CO2, and so would capture schools, hospitals, farms, malls, restaurants, large office buildings and many others. To exempt these sources, the tailoring rule unilaterally boosts the rule for greenhouse gases from 250 tons to 25,000 tons, an increase of two orders of magnitude. Well, well. In a speech in February, Obama EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson ridiculed those of us who warned about these consequences, saying that it was "a myth" that "EPA will regulate cows, Dunkin' Donuts, Pizza Hut, your lawnmower and baby bottles. . . . Somebody said to me today, 'kittens,' I like that one." Her routine got a big laugh from the like-minded Georgetown audience, but the new draft rule is a flat-out admission that the critics are right. The endangerment finding was prompted by the 5-4 2006 Supreme Court Mass. v. EPA decision, which relied on an extremely literal interpretation of the Clean Air Act to crowbar CO2 into the law. That decision has been a political windfall for cap-and-tax advocates because it has driven utilities and other businesses to the bargaining table as they've concluded that some carbon limits are inevitable. Yet the Supreme Court said nothing that would let the EPA simply decide on its own to apply the law to some unfavored business while giving others a pass. And the Clean Air Act is explicit about the 250-ton threshold. Team Obama's real motive in "tailoring" this rule is to limit the immediate economic impact of carbon limits to head off a political backlash. But even businesses that do get a pass shouldn't rest too easily. The green lobby will quickly sue to force the EPA to enforce fully its own rules and go after all carbon sources. And why not? The Obama Administration is deliberately flouting its own legal claims for political reasons. Its cynical political hope is that if Congress won't impose cap and tax, the courts will do it anyway. President Obama claims that his "new energy economy" will jump start growth and jobs. The EPA endangerment rule repudiates that claim once and for all. If the green future is going to be so bright, why does the White House want to exempt so many businesses from its glories?

For three decades, Belgian artist Luc Tuymans has used his palette of muted colors to scrutinize political leaders like Belgian King Baudouin and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Now, the 54-year-old painter aims to debunk the mystique of a subject closer to home: the idealized artist. Artists today are stereotyped either as romantically poor or glamorously rich, Mr. Tuymans says. "All these overblown ideas have...

Cans of smuggled gasoline are stored under a border crossing bridge between Colombia and Venezuela. Smugglers, given the nickname 'tanqueros', or tankers, fill up their tanks with gas in Venezuela, then drive over the border and sell it in Cucuta, Colombia, to make a profit.

COOMULPINORT, a pimpinero cooperative backed by Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol and the Colombian government, receives legal, discounted gasoline from Venezuela at this distribution plant, and then sells it to legitimate stations at competitive prices to break down smuggling. The profits are then reinvested in retraining pimpineros and lending them money to start new businesses. Jerome Sessini/Magnum Photos for The Wall Street Journal

The Barbarians rugby squad for the June 1 match against the British and Irish Lions in Hong Kong is taking shape, with 22 players now selected for the eagerly anticipated encounter. U.S. winger Takudzwa Ngwenya, who plays in France for Biarritz Olympique, was among this week's selections for the Barbarians, a club that was founded in England in 1890. The team is invitational; an all-star side featuring players from different countries every outing. Its love of attacking rugby is consistent and the players are always high quality. This will be the first time their opponents, the Lions, have ever played in Asia. The Lions consist of the very best players in the British Isles. After the match in Hong Kong, the Lions will tour Australia. Enlarge Image
Rowan Varty is the first Hong Kong national to be selected to play for the Barbarians rugby team. Getty Images Nigel Melville,
chief executive and president of USA Rugby, the sport's governing body in the U.S., said Ngwenya's selection to play the Lions was "fantastic news." Another winger in the team is Rowan Varty,
the captain of Hong Kong's rugby sevens team. Varty will become the first Hong Kong national to represent the Barbarians. Kevin Higgins
was the first American to play for the Barbarians, in 1991. He will be inducted to the U.S. Rugby Hall of Fame on June 8. "We have been very impressed with Rowan's contribution to the game in Hong Kong and have no hesitation in inviting him to be part of our squad," Derek Quinnell,
team manager of the Barbarians, or Baa-Baas, said in a statement following Varty's selection last month. "It will be a great experience for him and his impressive pace on the wing will be a bonus for us," said Mr. Quinnell, one of Welsh rugby's most celebrated players and a three-time British and Irish Lion himself. The Barbarians squad for the upcoming fixture includes Nick Evans
and Joe Rokocoko
of New Zealand, Dimitri Yachvili
and Imanol Harinordoquy of France, James Hook,
Duncan Jones
and Dwayne Peel
of Wales, Sergio Parisse
and Mario Castrogiovanni
of Italy, Francois Louw
of South Africa, and Kahn Fotuali'i
of Samoa. There are 10 different nationalities in total. All the world's top players are invited to play for the Barbarians at least once in their career. This is a very strong squad that should pose the Lions plenty of problems before their three-Test series in Australia. The Baa-Baas side is brimming with talent and contains a trio of Welshmen with a point to prove: Hook, Peel and Matthew Rees,
all former Lions who weren't selected for this tour. "Our selection process has taken several months and is still not quite complete. Over the next week or so we will be monitoring the domestic play-off matches in Europe and the various national squads for the summer tours," Mr. Quinnel
said in a statement Tuesday. Varty and Ngwenya can turn to one of the most experienced wingers in the game if they need advice. Their teammate Rokocoko is the most-capped winger in New Zealand rugby history, appearing in 68 tests for the All Blacks and scoring 46 tries. The Baa-Baas will play England at Twickenham, west London, on May 26 before flying to Hong Kong for the Lions match. The 37-man Lions squad was unveiled on April 30. It features 15 players from Wales, including captain Sam Warburton,
10 from England, nine from Ireland and three from Scotland. Rugby players from the British Isles widely agree that playing for the Lions is the highest honor in the game. The Lions rival New Zealand's All Blacks as the biggest brand in rugby, But the team, which tours Australia, New Zealand or South Africa every four years, hasn't won a test series since beating South Africa 2-1 in 1997.
