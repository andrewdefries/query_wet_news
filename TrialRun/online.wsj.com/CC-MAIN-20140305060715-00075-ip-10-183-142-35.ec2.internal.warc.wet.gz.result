Land of the Rising Bund
By
Richard Barley
May 14, 2012 10:23 a.m. ET
German bunds are starting to be grouped with Japanese government bonds: No matter how much investors think yields are too low already, they keep falling. Ten-year German yields Monday plummeted to a record low below 1.44%. With German inflation at 2.3% and 2012 growth forecast at 0.7%, bunds look very expensive. But rising fear of a euro-zone break-up, a slowing economy and scarce alternatives mean yields could go lower yet. The resurrected debate about a Greek euro exit is the immediate driver. While policy makers are...

WASHINGTON—The number of U.S. workers filing for initial jobless benefits stayed near a six-year low last week, though continued reporting irregularities make the data difficult to read. In the week ended Sept. 14, 309,000 workers filed unemployment claims, the Labor Department said Thursday. A department analyst said that figure represents a full week of data. However, claims for the prior week, which were revised to 294,000...

Updated April 18, 2009 12:01 a.m. ET
Chapter 8 Diversion After three months, Andrea Sanchez handed off Eric and Dylan's diversion cases to Robert Kriegshauser. In six years on the job Kriegshauser had supervised maybe five hundred clients, although only ten to fifteen were "exceptional" and allowed to leave the program early. Eric and Dylan were among that group. Kriegshauser and Sanchez have never spoken publicly. But in 2002 Kriegshauser was deposed as part of a lawsuit when injured Columbine victim Mark Taylor sued Solvay Pharmaceuticals, the maker of Luvox, the psychiatric drug Eric was on when he carried out the shootings. Kriegshauser's deposition has never before been made public, but it provides fodder for any number of Columbine theories. Eric and Dylan's ability to fool Kriegshauser may show them to be master con artists. That deceit also supports the popular diagnosis that Eric was a psychopath (although Dylan's deceit was also well done). The deposition's fine grain view into the diversion program may feed the idea that the program itself was flawed given Eric and Dylan's ability to slip through. *** Every diversion "client" writes an apology letter to the victim, according to Kriegshauser, even if they are busted for drugs. (In that case, the letter goes to the parents.) Eric and Dylan's letters went to Ricky Lynn Becker of Westover Mechanical Services. He was apparently assigned the van the night Eric and Dylan broke in. Dear Mr. Ricky Becker, Hello, my name is Eric Harris. On a Friday night in late-January my friend and I broke into your utility van and stole several items while it was parked at Deer Creek Canyon Road and Wadsworth. I am writing this letter partly because I have been ordered to from my diversion officer, but mostly because I strongly feel I owe you an apology and explanation. I believe that you felt a great deal of anger and disappointment when you learned of our act. Anger because someone you did not know was in your car and rummaging through your personal belongings. Disappointment because you thought your car would have been safe at the parking lot where it was and it wasn't. If it was my car that was broken into, I would have felt extreme anger, frustration, and a sense of invasion. I would have felt uneasy driving in my car again knowing that someone else was in it without my permission. I am truly sorry for that. The reason why I chose to do such a stupid thing is that I did not think. I did not realize the consequences of such a crime, and I let the stupid side of me take over. Maybe I thought I wouldn't be caught, or that I could get away. I realized very soon afterwards what I had done and how utterly stupid it was. At home, my parents and everyone else that knew me was shocked that I did something like that. My parents lost almost all their trust in me and I was grounded for two months. Besides that I have lost many of my privileges and freedom that I enjoyed before this happened. I am now enrolled in the diversion program for one full year. I have 45 hours of community service to complete and several courses and classes to attend over the course of my enrollment. Once again I would like to say that I am truly sorry for what I have done and for any inconvenience I have caused you, your family, or your company. Respectfully, Eric Harris Sanchez thought that Eric did a good job on the letter, which is undated. But in his personal diary on April 12, 1998 Eric wrote: Isnt america supposed to be the land of the free? how come, If im free I cant deprive a stupid f---ing dumbs--- from his possessions If he leaves them sitting in the front seat of his f---ing van out in plain sight and in the middle f---ing nowhere on a Fri-f---ing-day night. NATURAL SELECTION. f---er should be shot. same thing with all those rich snotty toadies at my school. f---ers think they are higher than me and everyone else with all their $ just because they were born into it? Ich denk NEIN. BTW, "sorry" is just a word, it doesnt mean S--- to me. everyone should be put to a test. an ULTIMATE DOOM test, see who can survive in an environment using only smarts and military skills. put them in a doom world, no authority, no refuge, no BS copout excuses. If you cant figure out the area of a triangle or what "cation" means, you die! if you cant take down a demon w/ a chainsaw or kill a hell prince w/ a shotgun, you die! f---ing snotty rich f---heads. [Censored by Jefferson County Sheriff] who rely on others or on sympathy or $ to get them through life should be put to this challenge. plus it would get rid of all the fat, retarded, crippled, stupid, dumb, ignorant, worthless people of this world, no one is worthy of this planet, only me and whoever I choose. there is just no respect for anything higher than your f---ing boss or parent. everyone should be shot out into space and only the people I say should be left behind. *** In his first full meeting with Eric, Kriegshauser showcased his "strict, or kind of black and white" philosophy. They discussed Eric's medication, and mood. The meeting would have lasted fifteen minutes to a half-hour and Eric was, "Very receptive. He was always extremely respectful," Kriegshauser says. If clients like Eric and Dylan were doing "really well," Kriegshauser explained, he liked to talk more intimately with them and go beyond the standard checklist stuff. So on August 24, "I brought up how do you feel about diversion, or however it came out. So the conversation basically went about or went around government, rules in society, authority versus not authority, chaos versus not chaos, that kind of stuff." Eric and Dylan both railed against blind faith in law and authority. "He [Eric] was anti-government, like just about every other client I have," Kriegshauser said. "He didn't like the fact that he was in trouble. He didn't like having the man tell him what to do. But he wasn't belligerent about it. He listened to what I was trying to express to him." Eric and Dylan asked something to the effect of, "What if we smoke pot? What if we don't agree with the rule that it's illegal?" Kriegshauser replied, "Well, it's illegal; and I told you [you] can't do it, period." Eric said, "Well, it figures, because you're the authority, which is real typical." Kriegshauser has since gone over that conversation in his head "a billion times." But the details may not have mattered. In fact the diversion program itself, meant to soothe and rectify Eric and Dylan, probably prodded them towards Columbine as they chafed against the strict guidelines and boiled inside for being caught. *** Eric was sent to a one-day program called Violence is Preventable. (Kriegshauser said such emotions never seemed to be a problem with Dylan). On December 1, 1998 Eric turned in his essay on what he had learned. It was exactly what Kriegshauser would want to hear: The anger management class I took was helpful in many ways. I feel the instructors were well qualified [sic] for this class and the class size was not too big. I learned several things about how drugs and alcohol contribute to violence, and how to avoid using drugs and alcohol. I felt like the class was focused more on people who had committed violent crimes and people who use drugs and alcohol, rather than being more broad. Nevertheless I still learned what anger is, how to recognize it, and how to deal with it. Violence is expensive, along with anger. Committing violent crimes brings forth fees, bills, and punishment that have very deep affects on that person, not to mention the emotional turmoil it causes.... I believe the most valuable part of this class was thinking up ideas for ways to control anger and for ways to release stress in a non-violent manner. Things such as writing, taking a walk, talking, lifting weights, listening to different music, and exercising are all good ways to vent anger. We also discussed the positive and negative results of anger and violence.... I feel that all of the suggestions can all be helpful, but the main part of anger management comes from the individual. If the person does not want to control his/her anger, then it can be a problem. The person must want to control his/her anger and actually want to not be violent or angry. It all starts in the person's mind. I have learned that thousands of suggestions are worthless if you still believe in violence. I am happy to say that with the help in this class, and several other diversion-related experiences, I do want to try to control my anger. But Kriegshauser wrote a different conclusion on December 1, 1998 in Eric's diversion file. "Eric honestly reported that he felt like the class was something of a waste of time. He had heard most of it." *** Kriegshauser also decided Eric did not need the life skills class he had been assigned. "He demonstrated to me that he had life skills under control," Kriegshauser told the attorneys gathered round him in the deposition. "He was pretty responsible and he was respectful and he thought of consequence of action, generally. He never had a major concern with that stuff. Or at least never showed any. So I put on, instead of that class, an adult legal issues packet, which was a packet intended to get&mdash;intended to get him to start thinking about if he continued criminal behavior, what could happen to him once he was an adult, based on the fact he was getting ready to graduate." In that exercise both Eric and Dylan were asked to explain certain crimes and penalties. It seems Columbine was on their minds. Dylan's example for disorderly conduct was, "Billy Bob sets off a smoke bomb in a library." For "complicity" he wrote, "Rashib tells Samir how to make a bomb, but only Samir detonates it." For accessory to a crime, Eric wrote, "Bobby murders Johny [sic]. Bobby's older brother, Billy, throws the shotgun used in the murder into a lake...." For disorderly conduct Eric wrote, "Bob and his AK-47 go downtown and he fires off a few shots while yelling 'LET'S FIGHT.'" "It's about making appropriate choices with friends," Kriegshauser explained, and Eric thought the course was interesting because he "discovered things that he did not know." *** Eric always maintained a steady mood, Kriegshauser says. He never seemed to be drunk or high, and never started rambling conversations with strangers. He never lost his temper, or seemed abnormally irritable. Aside from his complaints about government, Kriegshauser never knew Eric to be violent, or express hatred toward any person or group. Eric did not indicate he thought he was better than anyone else. He didn't seem obsessive compulsive. He didn't pace, shake, or tremble. He didn't appear hyperactive, or depressed. Some things never came up in conversation with Eric and Dylan, such as Nazism, bullying, or school authority figures. Kriegshauser did not discuss the break-in with the boys, and they did not talk about their older brothers. John DeCamp, the attorney for injured Columbine student Mark Taylor, whose lawsuit sparked the deposition, briefly chimed in during the session. While questions from the Solvay attorney took up about 140 of the 167 deposition pages, DeCamp took up only eight. After confirming that Eric was "one impressive young man," DeCamp asked Kriegshauser what may have made him "so to speak, go off the deep end." "I have no idea," Kriegshauser said. "When he left my program, he seemed absolutely appropriate and responsible. I have no idea what made this occur."
