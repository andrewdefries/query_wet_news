Francesco Guardi's 'The Doge of Venice Aboard the Bucintoro Leaving San Nicolò del Lido on Ascension Day' (1775-78)
RMN (Musee du Luvre)-Beatrice Hatala The sweeping monographic exhibition "Francesco Guardi (1712-1793)" at the Museo Correr, celebrating the 300th anniversary of the birth of the Venetian painter, opens with a large canvas showing a timid and rather forlorn-looking Guardi, moving from table to table, trying to sell his small paintings to rich revelers at a café in St. Mark's Square. Though the painting, by Guardi's contemporary Giuseppe Bertini, is mediocre at best, it sets the stage brilliantly for a retrospective of more than 150 paintings and drawings by Guardi gathered from the finest collections world-wide. Guardi started working in the family-run studio where his father and brothers were mainly commissioned to copy paintings for clients. His sister, Maria Cecilia, married the prolific and renowned Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. But Guardi never achieved any real measure of success in his lifetime. Only in the mid-19th century, as the result of a re-evaluation of Rococo, was his mastery recognized. This show is both thematic and, to a large extent, chronological as it follows the artist changing genres to suit the market. The paintings are beautifully displayed in large, newly restored rooms painted in bold Rococo colors of ocher, orange, red, blue, green or gray, alternating with smaller rooms where Guardi's delicate preparatory drawings are exhibited. Enlarge Image
'The Ridotto in Palazzo Dandolo at San Moisè' (circa 1750).
Private Collection In the first section, history paintings documenting the familiar events of 18th-century Venice, such as masked carnival-goers at the Ridotto, the state-run gambling house, are executed in precise detail, according to the canons of the neoclassical current of the day, with none of the fanciful splashes of color in the artist's later work. In the next sections, we see Guardi's fascinating development as a master of vedute and capriccios. Although Guardi is best known today as a vedutista, or view painter, the British aristocrats on their "Grand Tour" preferred the near-photographic precision of Canaletto's views to take home as souvenirs. In the 1750s, when he was already about 40 years old, Guardi moved into the landscape genre, perhaps taking advantage of a niche in the profitable market of foreign visitors since Canaletto had moved to England. His first attempts emulated Canaletto's controlled brush strokes. In fact, he used engravings by Canaletto for his inspiration but created his own version in color. Guardi's use of color is much warmer than Canaletto's strictly neutral palette—what curator Alberto Craievich calls "Canaletto toasted." After a decade of experimentation, Guardi's freer and looser personal style, evoking mood and atmosphere in his views, emerged in paintings such as the one of St. Mark's Square looking toward the Basilica, on loan from the National Gallery in London. As his own painterly style evolved, what was important to Guardi in his views wasn't perspective, but the changing sky and the shimmering lagoon. One of the merits of this exhibition is that it displays a number of works that have never been seen together before, allowing for comparison and a clear sense of the development of Guardi's increasingly personal style. In "The Doge Arrives in St. Mark's Square," tiny black-and-white brush strokes suggest the texture of the crowd in the piazza. With the capriccios, combining real and imaginary places, ancient and modern architecture in one picture, Guardi is in his element. Using paintings and prints by other artists as a starting point, he distorts and elaborates the settings into a singularly original fantasy. Though he painted landscapes and capriccios throughout his long career, they are gathered together in this section to highlight how evocative and original they were compared with other Venetian painters of the period. In his later years, Guardi was commissioned to document some of the ceremonies and celebrations of the Most Serene Republic of Venice, including a series involving the doge. The most celebrated of these, "The Doge of Venice Aboard the Bucintoro Leaving San Nicolò del Lido on Ascension Day," on loan from the Louvre, captures a moment in the festivities. The show ends with Guardi's last works, in which his exuberant style is fully evolved. Sky and water become the focal elements, always expanding, while the buildings become simply a line of demarcation between them. Though criticized in his own day for not following the conventions of graphically representing a view, which was the taste of the time, by the end of the exhibition a visitor understands why the Impressionists revered this once forgotten, but peerlessly original, artist a century later.
