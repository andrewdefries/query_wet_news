Chinese Auto Makers Feel Effects of Japan Dispute
By
Rose Yu
Oct. 29, 2012 12:33 p.m. ET
SHANGHAI—Customers shunning Japanese brand autos are having the opposite effect on two Chinese domestic auto makers: Dongfeng Motor Group Co. is reducing production at its joint ventures with Japanese auto makers while Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. got a lift from its joint venture with U.S.-based Ford Motor Co. Dongfeng, which has joint ventures with Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co., didn't elaborate the amount or duration of what it called production adjustments. The Wuhan-based auto maker said it has no plans to...

Fed to Test Banks Based on Severe Recession
By
Alan Zibel And Victoria McGrane Updated Nov. 15, 2012 6:00 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—Banks will be tested on their ability to withstand a severe recession—including a sharp slowdown in China—as part of a new round of "stress tests" to be completed next year, the Federal Reserve said. The 19 biggest U.S. lenders must outline dividend and repurchase plans with the central bank every year, and the Fed then publishes the results of a test that subjects the banks' loan and securities portfolios to...

U.S. stocks fell Wednesday as investors reacted to disappointing economic data and found little comfort in the Federal Reserve's decision to keep its easy-money policies in place. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 138.85 points, or 0.9%, to 14700.95, its worst start to a month since June 2012. Wednesday's selloff more than offset the 127-point gain the Dow posted over Monday and Tuesday. In the Markets Real Time Economics: Takeaways from the Fed Decision Fed Says Bond Purchases Could Rise or Fall Morning MoneyBeat: Market's Eyeing 1700, Not 1600, for S&P 500 U.S. stocks drop as investors react to disappointing economic data and found little comfort in the Federal Reserve's decision to keep its easy-money policies in place. Paul Vigna reports on The News Hub. Photo: Associated Press.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 14.87 points, or 0.9%, to 1582.70, with all 10 sectors lower, after gaining 15 points over Monday and Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite Index kept some of its two-day 49-point rally, though, falling 29.66 points, or 0.9%, to 3299.13. Heaviest hit were small-company stocks, which are seen by investors as most sensitive to trends in the U.S. economy. The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks smaller stocks, saw steep declines, shedding 23.23 points, or 2.4%, to 924.22. "As people have watched this market move higher, they [were] waiting to see when it was going to sell off," said Jonathan Corpina,
senior managing partner with brokerage firm Meridian Equity Partners Inc. The Fed, as expected, kept monetary policy largely unchanged. But when it came to the bond purchases the Fed has been employing to help boost the economy, officials signaled more flexibility with their strategy than in the past. The Fed said it could either increase or decrease bond purchases, depending on the job market and inflation. At previous meetings, Fed officials had talked only about winding down the bond-buying program. That shift was a negative for stocks because it signaled greater concern about the health of the economy, said John Lynch,
regional chief investment officer with Wells Fargo Private Bank, which oversees $170 billion in client assets. "If they're willing to [stimulate] more, the economy isn't able to do it on its own," Mr. Lynch said. Among the data causing investor worries, Automatic Data Processing

Analytics reported that 119,000 private-sector jobs were created in April, well below the 155,000 expected.

which manages roughly $1 trillion in assets. Also out Wednesday was data showing the manufacturing sector remained barely in expansion territory, and March construction spending declined 1.7% from February. Economists had expected a 0.7% increase. Merck ranked among the biggest decliners in the Dow industrials, losing $1.31, or 2.8%, to $45.69 after the drug maker's first-quarter revenue fell short of forecasts, as patent expirations weighed on pharmaceutical sales. Demand rose for the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, sending yields down to 1.638%. Gold futures eased 1.8% to settle at $1,446.30 a troy ounce. The dollar slipped against the euro and the yen. Most European markets were closed for the May Day holiday. London markets rose, with the FTSE 100 tacking on 0.3% in response to news that U.K. manufacturing activity improved more than expected in April. Most Asian markets were also closed for the Labor Day holiday, including those in mainland China, Hong Kong, India and South Korea. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average slipped 0.4%, after China's official manufacturing PMI for April fell to 50.6 from March's 50.9. Analysts expected an unchanged reading. Australia's S&P ASX 200 lost 0.5%. Facebook

By
Leslie Josephs
Dec. 12, 2012 6:49 p.m. ET
Frozen orange-juice concentrate futures rallied for a second consecutive session, settling at a three-month high on a projected decrease in orange output in top U.S. citrus grower Florida. Orange juice for delivery in January gained 3.2%, or 4.2 cents, to end at $1.341 a pound, the highest front-month settlement since Sept. 10. On Tuesday, federal forecasters said the crop in Florida, the top U.S. citrus grower, would produce...

The Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon plans to proceed with its April 28 race. But following the Boston Marathon bombings Monday, there is no guarantee that the Oklahoma City race—an event dedicated to the victims of a terror attack—will take place. Related Coverage New Clues Found in Boston Bombing Chinese Pour Out Grief for Student Marathon Amputees Face New Reality Obama Takes Lead After Attacks Citizen Surveillance Helps Officials Authorities Hone Terror Fight The Faces of Tragedy "Day by day, we're monitoring the intel we receive from the police and FBI," said Kari Watkins,
executive director of the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum, which launched the race in 2001 in honor of the 168 people killed and hundreds more injured in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995. In honor of the three people killed in Boston, the Oklahoma City race plans to add three seconds to a traditional 168-second period of silence before the start of its race. As yet, federal and local law-enforcement officials "have detected no intelligence" hinting the Oklahoma race might be a target, said Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett.
So race officials are encouraging the 24,000 people registered for one of several running events slated for April 28 to proceed with plans to participate. Entrants hail from 47 states and nine countries, Ms. Watkins said. Enhanced security measures will be implemented for the race, but Mr. Cornett said details of those measures wouldn't be disclosed. The Oklahoma City police department provides security for the event, he said. Terror in the U.S. Review other major plots of terrorism on American soil. View Graphics

More interactive graphics and photos Mr. Cornett acknowledged that only a limited degree of safety could be assured for participants and spectators expected to number in the tens of thousands. "I think people are realistic enough to know that you cannot secure a 26-mile long venue," he said. "In America, the freedoms we enjoy lead to opportunities for terrorists to create havoc." The Oklahoma City marathon from its outset enacted security measures that other marathons are considering only in the aftermath of the Boston bombings. In Oklahoma City, only clear bags have ever been accepted at the so-called gear-check booth, where runners can store dry clothing and other belongings to be retrieved beyond the finish line. Also, that booth is stationed a safe distance from the finish-line crowd, which was the target of Monday's attack in Boston. Unlike many marathons, the Oklahoma City race also vets its 3,000 volunteers and has always employed a director of security. Friday will mark the 18th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing. A government-hating former U.S. soldier named Timothy McVeigh
was arrested, convicted and in 2001 executed for detonating an explosives-filled truck outside the Murrah building. A convicted co-conspirator, Terry Nichols,
is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Write to Kevin Helliker at kevin.helliker@wsj.com Email

BEIJING—Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has repeated his commitment to steer clear of stimulus for the world's second-largest economy, even as the government reported contracting exports, amid concern about a continuing general slowdown. Coming after a raft of disappointing data in April and May, June's weak trade results added to fear that economic growth in the second quarter continued to slow. The median forecast of 18...
