Will progress be made at Mideast peace talks in Washington?
The U.S. invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to meet in Washington on Sept. 2 to launch long-stalled direct talks on a peace agreement. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the renewed negotiations aimed to "resolve all final status issues, which we believe can be completed within one year."What do you think? With new U.S. leadership, can talks which have been stalled for two years get moving again?(See more polls, discussions and hot topics.) Created by WSJ Editor

Pedro Gras writes that If one side thinks they can win, both will lose. Islam never loses; Islam merely suffers "set-backs". Islam lost in WWI, and she is still fighting today to regain what she lost there. She lost other lands over the centuries, and the Hamas Charter today calls for the regaining of every inch of any lands once controlled by Islam:
First, read number (iv) immediately below under Article Eleven. Then read numbers (i)-(iv):
"Article Eleven:” [note the phrase “and the same goes for any land the Moslems have conquered by force in number (iv)]”
(i) “The Islamic Resistance Movement believes that the land of Palestine is an Islamic Waqf consecrated for future Moslem generations until Judgement Day. It, or any part of it, should not be squandered: it, or any part of it, should not be given up.”
(ii)”Neither a single Arab country nor all Arab countries, neither any king or president, nor all the kings and presidents, neither any organization nor all of them, be they Palestinian or Arab, possess the right to do that”
(iii)” Palestine is an Islamic Waqf land consecrated for Moslem generations until Judgement Day. This being so, who could claim to have the right to represent Moslem generations till Judgement Day?” (iv) “This is the law governing the land of Palestine in the Islamic Sharia (law) and the same] goes for any land the Moslems have conquered by force, because during the times of (Islamic) conquests, the Moslems consecrated these lands to Moslem generations till the Day of Judgement." [numbers added]
-------
". . .the same [imposition of Sharia law] goes for any lands the Moslems have conquered by force"
Wake up Europe--as nearly all Europe remains ignorant of the true goals of Hamas, and of Iran by extension, as they blindly support the Palestinian cause. You're next, and with a nuclearized Iran.

@ Pedro Gras - Here's a handy bit of information on Hamas and its stated positions. http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/www.thejerusalemfund.org/carryover/documents/charter.html I think you will find Article Thirteen especially informative in developing your expectations.Cheers!Dan

85-15 against progress? That's silly! It's Mt. Rushmore time for Obama.Mideast Peace is like finding the Holy Grail and the Ark in the same week, politically. Iran will be relegated to the lost rube pile soon enough.

Rob,The "score" isn't 85 to 15 against progress, it is 85% against 15% that progress will be made, given the intractable position of Hamas. When one party to the talks has no intention of listening to the other side, in fact believes that that side (the Israelis) should be annihilated, how can any progress be expected to occur?

I guess it depends on what you define as progress... It's one thing to change attitudes and opinions, quite another to get people to change their values.

Jerry,You're correct. The values of the "Elected to political power Terrorist Group", Hamas, being well outlined in the Hamas Charter of 1988, I.e. Article 20 which calls for the complete annihilation of Israel and all Jews world-wide, leaves no room for discussion. Hamas has made it crystal-clear that talks with Israel will never be possible as Hamas refuses to recognize that Israel has a right to exist.Period.

You must mean like this value:
Article Thirteen: Peaceful Solutions, [Peace] Initiatives and International Conferences
[Peace] initiatives, the so-called peaceful solutions, and the international conferences to resolve the Palestinian problem, are all contrary to the beliefs of the Islamic Resistance Movement. For renouncing any part of Palestine means renouncing part of the religion; . . ."

I don't agree with your statement.Let's try it this way, "As long as one state adopts a "State Religion" that all are expected to follow, that calls for the annihilation of any who do not follow that religion, as Hamas calls for the annihilation of all Jews and of Israel, there will be no peace between the Jews and the Muslims."Your statement implies that Israel and the Jews will not engage in meaningful negotiations with the Palestinians, and that is simply nonsense. There has been much posted on this Topic to provide you with an excellent education. It will behoove you to read what has been posted, and them make an educated comment.

I hope Netanyahu stands firm because the Palestinians won't be willing to negotiate and Obama certainly won't have any backbone.

This is a reply to your comment which states: consider how much hate such a small community of people seems to instill in a world of other cultures so big that the only parable that I can think of that comes close is that of the ELEPHANT being afraid of a mouse.
I would suggest that it is not "this small community of people" which instills hatred in a world of other cultures, but rather those other cultures that do it themselves --and have been doing it since their inception, and well before there was a modern Israel.
Judaism predated both Christianity and Islam, and both of the latter found it desireable to attack the preceding religions in order to gain and maintain adherents.

He will have to walk the high wire between Israel's survival and it's reliance on the US as a partner. I suspect there will be considerable unilateral arm twisting coming from Obama on this.

Dan,While Israel certainly does depend on the US for much regarding its survival, the US also depends greatly on Israel and its ability to help maintain a semblance of normalcy in a part of the world in which any sense of normalcy is abnormal. I never cease to be amazed at the ability of a small "State" physically...think of a dot the size of a period "." versus this area, "O" as the land mass of the Arabic countries surrounding it, and with a population no greater than 8 Million, about the size of Los Angeles and Orange Counties in California, combined, to be able to survive all attempts to annihilate her, most notably during the Six Day War in 1967.Think of a people, the Jews, who number a whopping 15 million worldwide, give or take, versus 2.2 Billion Christians and 1.8 Billion Muslims, and in that light of that, consider how much hate such a small community of people seems to instill in a world of other cultures so big that the only parable that I can think of that comes close is that of the ELEPHANT being afraid of a mouse.While I agree that Obama will undoubtedly attempt to perform some unilateral "arm twisting", it is my hope that Netanyahu will be able to point out to Obama that given his far from "supportive" stance for Israel to date, anything short of the anticipated US Military bases being set up in Israel, under Israel's or a joint command, and anything short of the US providing Israel with the latest in hi-tech fighters and nuclear-armed submarines, will simply be, too short.In my opinion, not humble, it is time for those nations that claim to support Israel, to put up or shut up. Let those nations that threaten Israel with annihilation know that any attack on Israel will be considered to be an attack on the USA and the other countries of the "Free-World".

The mystery is why the US is involved in this media show. This has been going on forever and is of no particular importance to the US.
When BOTH sides want to cut a deal, they will. We are the odd man out.

James Benning: Israel provides the only balance for the US in the ME. Should Israel fall, none of the countries in the the ME will be willing to negotiate with civility and common sense with the US.Your suggesting that the conditions in the ME are of no importance to the US demonstrate your total lack of understanding the politics of the ME and their affect on America. America needs a solid relationship with Israel, and needs to support Israel for its OWN security, let alone to help maintain balance in the ME.To suggest that when the Israelis and the Palestinians are ready to "cut a deal" will leave the US the "Odd man out", is ludicrous.I'd suggest that you need an intensive course in ME history.

Why is the US involved? Because Iran has called for a world without the United States, and Iran is the major force keeping Hezbollah and Hamas alive and Iran is developing the BOMB and the US and the rest of the West are not going gangbusters in stopping her. Think about it.
Why is she doing it? Ahmadinejad explained in 2005 that he wants Islam to win the war of civilizations, and he believes that the tide of losses sustained by Islam from the West goes back 300 years (undoubtedly he refers to the Battle of Vienna). He also believes, and told the crowd in Tehran who heard his speech, that Palestine is a good place to turn the tide. He thinks Islam can win there; he thinks it MUST win there.
He wants to succor the Islamic troops.
He emphasizes that Iran is not there because the land of Palestine; he could care less, and he says so.
A good slogan for Iran, he says, would be A world without the United States.
I think that's a darned good reason for the US to be involved. How about you? READ IT YOURSELF

Seymour said: "The script has been written. Bibi is Obama's boy (as in "don't drop the soap") and O's calling the shots." Clearly, you know nothing of Netanyahu. and, ""...don't drop the soap"...is a ludicrous statement. This is the first time that anyone I've heard has implied that Netanyahu does Obama's bidding.I don't know from which revisionist history book you may be reading, but suggest you toss it.Obama has certainly done nothing to help any ME Peace movement, but you're buying into "pap".

Texan's Plans Put Wall Street on Edge
By
Patrick O'Connor
Updated March 29, 2013 11:07 a.m. ET
WASHINGTON—During Jeb Hensarling's first congressional bid, a man at a campaign stop in Athens, Texas, asked the Republican if he was "pro-business." "No," the candidate replied, drawing curious stares from local business leaders who had gathered to hear him speak, a former Hensarling aide recalled. "I'm not pro-business. I'm pro-free enterprise." Now, more than a decade later, that distinction...

CAIRO—President Mohammed Morsi's
battle with Egypt's judiciary and opposition groups escalated Sunday as hundreds of his Islamist supporters besieged the country's highest court to prevent it from ruling on the legitimacy of a panel that created a draft constitution. The court said it was suspending its sessions until the safety of its judges and personnel can be guaranteed. The rising tensions come after Mr. Morsi set a mid-December date for a referendum on the contested constitution, which contains several references to Islamic Shariah law, as both sides showed no sign of backing down. Enlarge Image
Morsi backers surrounded the Supreme Constitutional Court on Sunday. Later, a judges' group said it would boycott a constitutional referendum.
Associated Press See Related Video on #WorldStream "No to Constitution" Says New Tahrir Banner Barbed Wire Protects Cairo Government Compound Later on Sunday, the board of the Judges' Club, the largest association of judges, held a meeting at which they agreed not to participate in the constitution's referendum, according to its chairman Ahmed el-Zind.
"It is a very dark day in the history of the Egyptian judiciary," the Supreme Constitutional Court said. The developments represent the latest installment in Mr. Morsi's standoff with the judiciary and the opposition. The divisions are seen by many as the gravest threat to Egypt's fragile democratic transition since street protests toppled former strongman Hosni Mubarak
in February 2011 in one of the most closely watched uprisings of the "Arab Spring." "Egypt on the brink of a volcano," said a Sunday headline in Al-Masry al-Youm, one of the country's main dailies. The latest wrangling began on Nov. 22, when Mr. Morsi issued an edict which, among other things, shielded all his decisions and the Islamist-dominated panel drafting the constitution known as the Constituent Assembly from judicial review. The assembly last week rushed to approve a constitution in a marathon session, despite a boycott by more than a quarter of its members representing secular groups and churches in Egypt. The assembly's chairman handed Mr. Morsi the final draft of the constitution in a televised ceremony on Saturday, during which the president announced a Dec. 15 date for the referendum as hundreds of thousands of his Islamist supporters rallied in Cairo. Most were bused in from the provinces. Secular and liberal parties in the opposition, as well as youth movements and others, have rejected the draft constitution and Mr. Morsi's edict. They view the moves as a blatant attempt by Islamist parties, led by the Muslim Brotherhood, to implement their Islamic agenda and consolidate their hold on power in the Arab world's most populous and strategic state. Siding with the opposition groups are a majority of the country's judges, many of whom were appointed by Mr. Mubarak's regime and who have been on strike since Nov. 25 to protest Mr. Morsi's edict. For their part, both Mr. Morsi and his Islamist allies see the opposition's stance as a conspiracy—fueled by former regime loyalists and businessmen, corrupt judges and unnamed foreign states—to undermine the president and his government, who were the product of what they say was "the fairest election" in the country's history. So far, the anti-Morsi camp has remained firm in its opposition. "We are sending a final warning to Dr. Mohammed Morsi who was elected as a legitimate and democratic president of the country that his legitimacy is eroding and diminishing with his policies and actions that are biased toward his party and group," said a statement issued by 18 secular and liberal parties as well as youth movements that played a pivotal role in the anti-Mubarak uprising. The signatories said they were organizing a large demonstration dubbed "the last chance" outside the presidential palace on Tuesday to pressure Mr. Morsi to rescind last month's decree and postpone the referendum on the constitution. The groups say the document is illegitimate because, they say, it was drafted and rushed through by an Islamist-led body that doesn't reflect Egyptian society's ideological diversity. The same groups have threatened civil disobedience across the country if Mr. Morsi doesn't respond to their demands this week. "We cannot have a referendum on it [the constitution] because there has been no dialogue about it," said Mohsen Ibrahim,
45 years old, a florist who is among the hundreds of people who have camped in Cairo's central Tahrir Square for more than 10 days to protest Mr. Morsi's edict. "It's full of nails and land mines." In his speech at Saturday's ceremony, Mr. Morsi recognized the deep polarization in the country and called on his opponents for "a serious national dialogue about the nation's worries." But he also reiterated his determination to press ahead with the referendum. "This responsibility makes it imperative in front of God, you, the Egyptian nation and the world that I forge ahead and not hesitate to carry out the will of this nation," Mr. Morsi said. The president and his Islamist allies, especially the Muslim Brotherhood he once led, are banking on their grass-roots support across Egypt and a highly organized party machine to win approval for the referendum, which they have estimated at 70%. If it fails, Mr. Morsi will have to call for the formation of a new Constituent Assembly to produce another draft. Driving the pro-Morsi camp is also a belief that former regime loyalists, including those in the judiciary, are determined to turn back the clock to the Mubarak era and deny Islamists their legitimate win. This was evident in the speeches made by Islamist politicians and clerics on Saturday at their rally outside Cairo University's main campus, branding opposition leaders, the media and some judges as "enemies of Egypt." The same atmosphere prevailed Sunday among those surrounding the Supreme Constitutional Court building in Cairo's Maadi neighborhood. Many had spent the night on the court's lawn and marble entrance, sleeping on blankets and cardboard cutouts, as riot police stood nearby to prevent them from storming the building. "This court is the claw of the conspiracy," said Hatem Heikal,
55, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Write to Sam Dagher at sam.dagher@wsj.com Email

Remnants of a pressure-cooker bomb used in the Boston attack that killed three people.
FBI/Associated Press Investigators have found female DNA on at least one of the bombs used in the Boston Marathon attacks, though they haven't determined whose DNA it is or whether its presence means a woman helped the two brothers suspected in the bombings, according to U.S. officials briefed on the probe. In another development, Russian officials revealed details about contacts between the older brother and suspected Islamist radicals in the Caucasus, including Internet exchanges that led to concerns by investigators that he was trying to join up with jihadist fighters. Speaking Monday about the DNA discovery, the U.S. officials cautioned that there could be multiple explanations for why genetic material from someone other than the two bombing suspects—
Tamerlan Tsarnaev
and his younger brother, Dzhokhar
—could have been found on remnants of the exploded devices. It could have come, for example, from a store clerk who handled materials used in the bombs or a stray hair that ended up in the bomb. Monday, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents visited the Rhode Island home of the parents of Katherine Russell,
the widow of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. He died after a shootout with police four days after the April 15 bombings. "The FBI is there as part of our ongoing investigation, but we aren't permitted to discuss specific aspects of the case," said FBI spokesman Jason Pack. Ms. Russell has been staying with her parents since the bombings, and FBI agents have been seen posted outside the house since her late husband was identified as one of the bombers. Her lawyer has said she is "doing everything she can to assist with the investigation." Enlarge Image

Dagestan Federal Security Service One official familiar with the case said agents went to the house Monday to collect a DNA sample from Ms. Russell, the culmination of days of negotiations. FBI officials also have been negotiating with Ms. Russell's attorney in recent days to gain fuller access to question her, the officials familiar with the case said. The officials said the DNA request was needed to determine whether it matched the DNA found on the bomb remnants. Ms. Russell is one of as many as a half-dozen people in whom investigators are interested as they seek to determine if the brothers had any help in the bomb attack or the days afterward, the officials said. Ms. Russell's lawyer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the latest developments. Investigators have no evidence that any of the associates of the brothers had knowledge of the bombing plot, and they believe that if anyone helped to dispose of evidence—a point that remains uncertain—it may have been unwitting, according to officials briefed on the investigation. Related Defense Lawyer Has Background Of Capital Cases Both U.S. and Russian authorities are trying to learn more about Tamerlan Tsarnaev's activities while staying in Russia from January to July of 2012. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone Monday and agreed to boost antiterror cooperation, officials on both sides said. Two Russian government officials said Tamerlan Tsarnaev exchanged notes over the Internet with William Plotnikov,
a boxer who moved with his parents from Russia to Canada before joining militants in the North Caucasus. And they said Mr. Tsarnaev met several times in early 2012 with Mansur Makhmud Nidal, an alleged militant from the Russian province of Dagestan and suspected jihadist recruiter. The meetings happened in a mosque in Dagestan's capital of Makhachkala known for its adherence to a puritanical strain of Islam, they said. The Tsarnaevs' parents have denied their sons were involved in terrorism.

Mr. Nidal died in a firefight in Makhachkala last May after a five-hour standoff that ended with him throwing a grenade at police officials, according to Russian authorities. Mr. Plotnikov died two months later, in mid-July, during a raid in the hinterland of Utamysh, a village southwest of Makhachkala. Mr. Tsarnaev was in the region at the time of both raids but left Russia for the U.S. three days after the second one. He left before picking up a Russian passport that had been prepared for him at the local migration office in Dagestan's capital. "He intended to join the fighters, but he lost his contacts," one of the Russian officials said. "In the end he picked an easier enemy in Boston." The Russian officials said it was unclear whether Mr. Tsarnaev and Mr. Plotnikov ever met in person. The parents of the two boxers say they don't recall any interaction between the two. There are no indications that the two men ever boxed together, and Russian officials haven't yet produced any of the online communication that they say exists. A U.S. official said Russian authorities haven't shared any information about Mr. Tsarnaev related to contact with any suspected militants during his trip last year to Dagestan. Several U.S. officials, however, said they believe Russia has more information about Mr. Tsarnaev that hasn't been handed over. —Paul Sonne contributed to this article.

Islamic militants attempted to destroy a Timbuktu library storing thousands of ancient texts, but curators managed to hide away much of the priceless material until French-led forces captured the historic town. WSJ's Aaron Jaffe explains how on the News Hub. Photo: Getty
TIMBUKTU, Mali—French tanks were closing in on this storied caravan city on the night of Jan. 23, when the al Qaeda-backed militants who had governed Timbuktu since April left a departing blow. They broke into one of the world's most valuable libraries, ripping centuries-old manuscripts from shelves. Then they torched these priceless artifacts, in a scene of destruction that horrified scholars around the world. But in a relief for this beleaguered city, and in a triumph for bibliophiles, the vast bulk of the library was saved by wily librarians and a security guard—with an assist from modern technology. An estimated 28,000 of the library's artifacts were smuggled out of town by donkey cart, said Prof. Abdoulaye Cissé
and security guard Abba Alhadi,
who worked to relocate the documents. Gunmen managed to burn only a few hundred papers, but even those were backed up digitally, said the library's bookkeepers. "We knew that what we had here was threatened," said Mr. Cissé, a history professor and acting director for Timbuktu's Ahmed Baba Institute for Higher Studies and Islamic Research. "So I said, 'We're going to have to start moving them out.' " Enlarge Image

Agence France-Presse/Getty Images More French Jets Strike Insurgent Refuge France's Hollande to Visit Mali The rescue mission for some of Africa's most precious written history represents the latest example of Timbuktu's collective determination to preserve its heritage, amid a long line of threats to these irreplaceable artifacts. Aside from its 14th-century mud mosques, and a fabled name, Timbuktu houses at least 100,000 ancient manuscripts that date from the 11th century, and account for some of the medieval world's most sophisticated scholarship. Subjects include medicine, law, astronomy and botany. Still, the treasures of Timbuktu have been looted and smashed by a succession of invading armies, the most recent being al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM. In April, the al Qaeda affiliate, alongside local allies, took control of this dun-colored town—home to 50,000 people—and began imposing strict Islamic law. The punishments are spelled out on a lined piece of paper still left in the Malian Solidarity Bank that the rebels made their Islamic Police Headquarters. For petty theft, one hundred blows. For an affair with a married woman, death. The gunmen also bulldozed shrines deemed un-Islamic, some as old as the 15th century. The International Criminal Court has said the destructive binge could constitute a war crime, and is considering an investigation. On Sunday, al Qaeda's wrecking spree came to a close, as French and Malian tanks trundled into town. The parade brought locals dancing into the street, playing music (which had been banned) and smoking cigarettes (also banned) and waving French flags. Saving the Treasures of Timbuktu View Slideshow

Benoit Tessier/Reuters The next challenge is to hold the towns. French troops are looking to hand over the duty to a West African coalition of troops, who aren't as well armed as AQIM. France on Thursday conducted airstrikes on a mountain range in Mali's northeast where Islamist insurgents are believed to have sought refuge, as Diocunda Traoré,
Mali's interim president, signaled he was ready to begin conditional negotiations with ethnic Tuareg groups that have claimed the country's north as their independent homeland. Malian soldiers complain their enemies boast stronger, more ample ammunition. Many Malian officials say they believe rebels are refashioning Soviet rockets trafficked from Libya into dangerous land mines. There are other things buried under Timbuktu. Locals here have long stashed ancient documents under the brick floors of their houses, or under furniture, out of an enduring fear of invading armies. When Alpha Konaté's grandfather died six years ago, he found about 30 wooden trunks filled with manuscripts in a workroom where he had been forbidden to play as a child.

Others were plastered into the house's walls, stashed there by a great-grandfather who had accused French soldiers of stealing and destroying his parchments when they conquered this desert in 1905. The sepia-toned pages are penned in ornate Arabic. "We have more that belong to us, but they're in France," he said. More recently, technology offered a way to put Timbuktu's ancient manuscripts out of reach of pillagers. In 2008, the University of Cape Town helped finance a multistory, glass-paneled library and preservation complex, whose staff sought to digitize Timbuktu's written heritage. Locals were slow to bring in their papers, though. Just 2,000 texts were stored at the center, said Mr. Cissé, and other library workers. "They prefer to look after it themselves, because it's their cultural riches," he said. "They're all over the city." About 28,000 parchments stayed in Timbuktu's older, more modest library nearby. Both institutions came under threat in April, when the city fell to separatist rebels fighting to carve this northern half of Mali into an independent nation for the Tuareg people. The gunmen looted the town, and several tried to break down the doors of the new library. AQIM and an allied militia called Ansar Dine stopped the looting, said Mr. Cissé. Ansar Dine's leader, Iyad ag Ghaly
—famous in Mali for his reclusiveness—personally gave the curator his phone number. "He said, if these people ever come back to try again, you call us," said Mr. Cissé. Islamists sent a more-menacing message on Dec. 30, when they came to the old library, which houses the bulk of the literature. They told the guard, Mr. Alhadi, that they planned to convert the building into a Quranic school. Over the next two nights, Messrs. Cissé and Alhadi met in darkness, and began stuffing texts into empty burlap millet sacks. They stacked the bags onto donkey carts, stashed them in bedrooms, and over the next few days, carted them to small boats along the nearby Niger River. From there, the boats sailed four days south to the first town under government control, Mopti. A truck, the two men said, carried the priceless artifacts to the capital, Bamako, where officials with the University of Cape Town said they are safe. On Wednesday, Ansar Dine gunmen came to the library, said Mr. Alhadi. The elderly guard refused to let them in, then hobbled away on his cane. The militants broke in, taking a refrigerator, mattresses and plastic chairs—but no manuscripts. Across town, Mr. Konaté had a simpler preservation method. On Tuesday, he said he saw two gunmen looking at the plaque outside his house: It reads "Biblioteque de Manuscripts," or manuscript library, a reference to his grandfather's parchment collection. "I had no trust in them," said Mr. Konaté, a watch repairman by profession. So he emptied the shelves of his library, filled them with children's schoolwork, and stuffed his heritage into Nescafé boxes. —Gabriele Parussini in Paris contributed to this article.

Fired Los Angeles Police Department officer Christopher Dorner is seen in an undated photo.
AFP/Getty Images ANGELUS OAKS, Calif.—The manhunt for a former Los Angeles police officer suspected in three killings this month appeared to come to an end Tuesday, with law-enforcement officials recovering a body from a burned cabin where they believed he had holed up during a shootout with officers. In a statement emailed late Tuesday night, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's department said investigators at the site had "located charred human remains within the debris of the burned out cabin." The statement added that forensic analysis would be used to try to identify those remains. Sheriff's deputies believed they had tracked Christopher Dorner,
the fugitive officer, to the cabin after responding Tuesday afternoon to reports that a car-thief suspect near the ski town of Big Bear Lake resembled him, said Jodi Miller,
a spokeswoman from the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department. Two deputies were shot, one of them fatally, during the ensuing standoff. Enlarge Image
Above, investigators work near the cabin.
Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times/Associated Press LAPD Commander Andrew Smith
said the department remained on high tactical alert and would "leave no stone unturned" to find anyone who had assisted the fugitive in his spree. He added that officers named by Mr. Dorner in an 11-page manifesto, in which he accused Los Angeles police officials of corruption, blamed them for losing his job, and promised retribution, remained under protection, as did their families. After deputies Tuesday found the vehicle that was reported stolen on one of the area's main roads, the suspect fled into the forest and barricaded himself inside an empty rental cabin, Ms. Miller said. Shortly afterward, scores of gunshots were audible on the local police scanner and on a local television station that had a reporter in the area. Two deputies were airlifted to a local hospital with injuries, she said. One was later confirmed dead by the Sheriff's Department, which added that the other was in surgery and was expected to survive. Police surrounded the cabin and closed the three main roads leading out of the mountain area. Late Tuesday afternoon, television footage showed flames and smoke pouring from the building where the suspect was believed to be holed up. As dusk fell, authorities reopened the highway into the area, even as they continued to remain tight-lipped about whether they believed Mr. Dorner was alive or dead. Enlarge Image

REUTERS Law-enforcement agencies had been searching the forest for Mr. Dorner since Thursday, when they discovered his abandoned truck on fire and followed footprints into the snow until they disappeared. After a fruitless search of 400 homes, officers suspended their search Friday amid heavy snowfall. On Sunday, the Los Angeles Police Department announced a $1 million reward for information leading to Mr. Dorner's capture. By Tuesday, officers were continuing to sift through 1,045 tips, some of which were dead ends and some of which were "panning out," LAPD Commander Andrew Smith said at a news conference. "We believe this person may be watching TV…so we wouldn't want to tip our hand. That would put our officer at an extreme tactical disadvantage," Mr. Smith said earlier in the day. Officials said late Tuesday afternoon that they couldn't confirm that the person suspected of stealing the vehicle and shooting the deputies was Mr. Dorner. The events began Feb. 3, when two people were found dead of gunshot wounds in a parking lot in Irvine, Calif. Authorities later named Mr. Dorner as a suspect, saying one of the dead was the daughter of an LAPD officer who represented Mr. Dorner in a disciplinary-review proceeding in 2008. Mr. Dorner was fired that year after that proceeding determined he had falsely accused another officer of using excessive violence. Mr. Dorner denied doing so. Mr. Dorner's grievance appears to stem from an incident in 2007, when his training officer in the LAPD's Harbor division gave him an "unsatisfactory" rating after Mr. Dorner left her in the middle of a foot pursuit, After learning about the rating, he filed a report of his own claiming that she had kicked a handcuffed suspect in the head, according to a police officer in her unit.

The commission looking to overhaul Connecticut's mental-health system, appointed after the deadly rampage at a Newtown school, doesn't actually know whether the man who committed those crimes was ever treated for mental illness. And due to privacy laws, the commission may never know. "Adam Lanza, so far, remains a black box," said Harold Schwartz, psychiatrist in chief at Hartford Hospital's Institute of Living and a...

Columbia and Tristar studios have been illegally uploaded to the world's most popular video site, generating hundreds of millions of views over the past year. Why the movie studios didn't block the films by using a special YouTube program—called Content ID—for identifying their copyrighted content is a mystery. On Thursday, after inquiries by The Wall Street Journal, Disney used Content ID to successfully block some of the classic animated films that have been on YouTube for as long as a year, including "Peter Pan," "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," and "Fantasia." Enlarge Image
Disney classic films, like'Snow White,' have been uploaded to YouTube.
Disney/Everett Collection Representatives of Disney, Sony, MGM Studios and Warner Bros. declined to comment on the situation or why they haven't blocked the films using Content ID. A YouTube spokeswoman said the site "invested heavily in copyright and content management tools to give rights holders control of their content on YouTube" and that more than 4,000 media companies use Content ID. The site is continually improving the technology behind Content ID, she said, adding that to date it has identified more than 200 million copyrighted videos that were uploaded. Howard Gantman,
a spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America, a trade group that represents film studios in copyright matters, said: "We are aware of the issue and are concerned about it. Our member companies have raised the issue with YouTube and hope they will work cooperatively with us to fix it." The return of the problem shows how piracy continues to pop up for YouTube, even after it took steps to eradicate the issue and the problem had lain largely dormant over the past five years. YouTube, acquired by Google in 2006, was sued in 2007 by Viacom Inc.,

which owns TV channels such as MTV. Viacom claimed there were thousands of unauthorized clips uploaded to YouTube and Google was liable for copyright infringement. YouTube said it is protected from liability by a law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and that it took down infringing content when it received notices. The suit is still pending. Earlier YouTube in Talks to Let Video Creators Charge Viewers 1/29/13 The Real Hits of YouTube 10/12/12 YouTube to Fund Channels Abroad 10/8/12 Doubling Down on 'Channel' Experiment 7/30/12 YouTube Tees Up Big Talent 10/29/11 Google in late 2007 launched Content ID, which helps identify copyrighted material so content owners can block the content from appearing on the site altogether, or in certain geographical markets. Alternatively, content owners can choose to let YouTube sell online advertisements that appear next to or on top of the videos while they play. Content owners get the majority of the ad revenue. Some of the full-length films uploaded by individual users within the past year, including some produced by MGM Studios such as the 1990 hit "Misery," currently appear with ads. Content ID helped curtail the piracy issue, some media executives have said. Since then, Google has struck deals with Disney and other studios to host some of their TV content on YouTube or sell movie rentals of full-length feature films. The recent problematic uploads may have undercut the rental effort. Movies produced by Disney's Touchstone Pictures, such as "I Am Number Four" and "Shanghai Noon" are available free on YouTube, even though the studio struck a rental deal through the site. To be sure, illegally uploaded movies could easily become unavailable if the content owners attack the problem. Some individuals who uploaded films using pseudonymous accounts wrote in the video description box on the Web page that they don't own a copyright. Others provide written instructions to other YouTube users on how to download the illegally uploaded films from YouTube using certain software. People who have used Content ID at media companies said the system works well, but that some individuals who illegally upload videos to YouTube have been able to manipulate the soundtrack or video to avoid detection by the system. These people add that some media companies don't always use the system properly and forget to block some illegal content. On social media sites such as Twitter, many people have expressed surprise about the full-length films and are posting links to their followers. Kailey Fry,
a high-school student near Toledo, Ohio, said she previously saw written notices on YouTube pages that pirated content had been removed due to copyright claims. But several months ago, a friend told her that YouTube had a growing array of full-length films. Last week, Ms. Fry discovered and watched the 1957 film, "The Three Faces of Eve" on YouTube. Since then she has watched other films and organized a sleepover for friends to watch "Halloween," the 1970s horror flick, on YouTube using her laptop. "I'm going to use YouTube a lot more," the 16-year-old said. Write to Amir Efrati at amir.efrati@wsj.com Email
