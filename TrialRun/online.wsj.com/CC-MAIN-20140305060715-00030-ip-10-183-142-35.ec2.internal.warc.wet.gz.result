FTC's Proposed Changes to Web Privacy Rules Give Parents More Control
By
Emily Steel
September 16, 2011

The FTC is proposing changes to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act that include requiring parental consent for websites to collect a broader range of information about children under age 13, including location. They also would require parental permission for a website to use tracking software,...

Singapore Airlines Offers Unpaid Leave to Pilots
By
Gaurav Raghuvanshi
Updated Jan. 7, 2013 10:06 a.m. ET
SINGAPORE—Singapore Airlines Ltd. is offering its most senior pilots an option of taking unpaid leave, the latest move among Asia's premium carriers to contain costs amid lackluster demand for long-haul travel. The voluntary plan, launched in December, allows captains at the Singapore-based carrier to take up temporary employment with other airlines or just take time off, and follows a similar offer made to the airline's more junior...

Novak Djokovic,
two matches after being pushed to the limit by Stanislas Wawrinka
in a five-set thriller, looked unbeatable in the first Australian Open men's semifinal on Thursday. Novak Djokovic celebrates his win over David Ferrer on Thursday.
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images He lost just five games and didn't face a break point against fourth-seeded David Ferrer,
winning 6-2, 6-2, 6-1. It was a thoroughly dominating performance. And by one measure, it was in fact the most dominant match in a Grand Slam semifinal or final in at least 22 years. But it may not have told us very much about Djokovic's chances of winning this title for the third straight time. So let's look at a statistic we might call the dominance ratio: the ratio of the winner's percentage of return points won to his opponent's percentage of return points won. The result won't always conform with a sense of how close the matches were: A winner of a five-setter in which he dropped two sets in tiebreakers and won the other three sets 6-0 probably would have a higher dominance ratio than a straight-sets win in which each set was decided by a tiebreaker. But it does convey how much more likely the winner was to break his opponent's serve than to have his serve broken, from game to game, which should convey useful information about the level of play he's bringing to his next match. By that measure, Djokovic's demolition of Ferrer stands alone. He dropped just seven of 51 service points while winning 41 of 75 points on Ferrer's serve. That translates to a dominance ratio of 4. That's far ahead of the next-highest at a men's Grand Slam semifinal or final since 1991, as far back as return winning percentage stats are available: 2.74 in Roger Federer's defeat of Tommy Haas in the 2009 Wimbledon semifinals. But prior semifinal routs don't do a better job than tournament seeding in predicting the outcome of finals. So: Well done, Novak Djokovic. Now he will likely be favored in the final—and he should, as the 2008, 2011 and 2012 champion here and the No. 1 player in the world. But the extreme nature of his rout of Ferrer—as impressive and unprecedented as it was—shouldn't boost his odds even higher. —Carl Bialik

U.S. Electricity Use on Wane
By
Rebecca Smith
Jan. 2, 2013 7:39 p.m. ET
Americans are using more gadgets, televisions and air conditioners than ever before. But, oddly, their electricity use is barely growing, posing a daunting challenge for the nation's utilities. The Energy Information Administration is projecting that electricity use in the U.S. will rise an average of just 0.6% a year for industrial users and 0.7% for households through 2040. That's a far cry from the middle decades of the...

The view from the living room of producer Darren Star's apartment at One Central Park West.
Natalie Keyssar for The Wall Street Journal Television producer Darren Star's three-bedroom condo in the Trump International Hotel and Tower at One Central Park West has been a place for him to escape from the city and a rigorous filming schedule. But every year the apartment also has offered a holiday bonus: a prime spot for watching the Thanksgiving parade as it marches its way down Central Park West toward Herald Square. Mr. Star, 51 years old, bought the apartment in 2004 for $6.1 million, after having lived in the building since 1997 when filming started on one his most successful shows, "Sex and the City." The 3,059-square-foot apartment, which has 4½ bathrooms, is currently on the market for $14.9 million. A Prime Parade View

A view from the apartment
Natalie Keyssar for The Wall Street Journal In addition to the spectacular views and a "wonderful office den" in the 35th-floor apartment, Mr. Star says he is probably going to most miss the building's staff, which he describes as "attentive and caring." Seventeen floors of the 52-story building operate as a hotel while the remaining floors have residential units, according to StreetEasy. Mr. Star says he could come back from shooting "at three in the morning and get room service and be in my own home and hotel." He adds: "I am very sensitive to noise, which is something in New York you have to get used to." In the apartment, "you're up there on the 35th floor and it's just so quiet and peaceful." The location and height of the apartment also places it directly above the Thanksgiving parade as it moves down Central Park West and through Columbus Circle. The parade route is changing slightly this year—it will continue along Central Park South a bit farther before heading south down Sixth Avenue, instead of its traditional route down Seventh Avenue. The location made his apartment a popular place to stay for family and friends over Thanksgiving over the years. He recalls once hosting family members, including his sister, niece and parents for the parade. The building's exterior is pictured.

Natalie Keyssar for The Wall Street Journal "I didn't realize that at certain point the streets were cordoned off," he says, recalling that his family, who had gone out earlier, "spent hours trying to find their way to the apartment but ended up watching from East side. I didn't realize you had to get to the building for a certain hour. Lesson learned," he says. Once ensconced in the building, Mr. Star says his favorite place to watch the parade isn't in fact his apartment. "I love watching it from the front steps of the building. It's a cozy spot with everybody watching it and you're right in front of the parade," he says. The apartment features a drop-down screen and projector in the living room where Mr. Star hosts Oscar and New Year's Eve parties. The space underwent an 18-month renovation that was completed last year and included taking down some walls to open up the view in a redesign by Los Angeles-based decorator Waldo Fernandez. "I had the experience of doing a renovation in New York, which I don't recommend to anyone," says Mr. Star. "Any future apartment I have in New York is going to be turnkey," he laughs. Mr. Star says he finds himself spending more time in Los Angeles now and will look for another apartment in New York at a later date. "The main reason I'm selling is that it is a fantastic apartment for someone who is spending more time in New York than I am," he says. "I miss it when I'm not there, and unfortunately I'm not there enough."

Tax uncertainty in Washington is setting off a mad scramble among wealthy taxpayers and charities to maximize donations before the end of the year. Their worry: The tax deduction for charitable giving, a fixture of the tax code for nearly a century, is coming under pressure as part of a broader fiscal agreement now being hammered out on Capitol Hill. Enlarge Image
Kent Clark, CEO of Grace Centers of Hope, a charity that helps homeless families, said he is asking donors to make gifts before year-end.
Fabrizio Costantini for The Wall Street Journal Related: The Fiscal Cliff
WSJ reporters discuss the major developments in the ongoing fiscal cliff saga but also turn their attention to Syria, and the mounting security and humanitarian threats developing there.
In an interview with WSJ's Jerry Seib, Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) says a deal will be reached to prevent the U.S. going over the fiscal cliff thanks - in part - to the bipartisanship of the Senate.
Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) says a deal will be reached to avoid the fiscal cliff and predicts Republicans will eventually cave on tax rates. WSJ reporters discuss the week's fiscal cliff negotiations as well as the developing crisis in Syria.

The rush shows the extent to which wrangling in Washington over deficit reduction already is affecting the way taxpayers are spending their money. In addition to rethinking their charitable giving, some taxpayers are accelerating large medical expenses, selling appreciated stock and even prepaying mortgages, financial advisers say. "People want to take advantage of 2012's certainty," said Benjamin Pierce,
head of Vanguard Charitable, a nonprofit group affiliated with money manager Vanguard Group Inc. "Front-loading is very much on their minds." Fidelity Charitable, an affiliate of Fidelity Investments, took in $1.2 billion for the first nine months of 2012, up 63% from the same period in 2011, while Schwab Charitable, an affiliate of Charles Schwab Corp.

, recorded a 74% jump for the third quarter. Vanguard Charitable saw a 43% increase through the end of November. The charitable deduction has been under fire from some politicians on both sides of the aisle for several years. Speaking to business leaders at the Business Roundtable in Washington on Wednesday, President Barack Obama
said a complete elimination of the charitable deduction is unlikely. More Tax Report: Deduct Now, and Give Later 5 Things to Know About Year-End Donations Talks on Fiscal Cliff Resume After Standoff McConnell Takes Hard Line Live: Fiscal Cliff Stream The deduction, which has been part of the tax code since 1917, allows taxpayers to reduce their taxable income by giving money or other assets to certain tax-exempt groups, including churches, schools and charities. All told, Americans donate about $300 billion each year to charity, according to a recent report by the Giving USA Foundation and the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. December is typically a big month for giving. The possibility of a deduction limit is prompting many charities to ramp up their collection efforts. Feeding America, a Chicago hunger-relief charity with about $1.2 billion in annual donations of cash and food, is asking donors "to consider paying forward their commitments," said donor development officer Maura Daly,
adding that she already has heard from several supporters planning to do so. Make Your Own Deficit-Reduction Plan Try your hand at balancing the budget and share the results.

More photos and interactive graphics The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society said its fundraisers are armed with relevant information on potential tax changes when they make calls. Given the uncertainty, said donor development director Michael Osso,
"we're more determined than ever to help them understand the benefits of giving right now." The Great Commission Foundation of Campus Crusade for Christ, an Orlando evangelical group, is seeing bigger gifts than last year, in part because "we have these conversations" with donors, said Bob Hawkes,
executive director of the group. "We're not tax experts, but we share resources, ask them to talk to their tax advisers and send out a weekly newsletter on Washington." Many taxpayers are piling into "donor-advised" funds such as those run by Fidelity, Schwab and Vanguard. Such funds enable givers to donate now and secure a full deduction for 2012, while pushing decisions about charitable gifts to specific causes into the future. After money goes into such a fund, it is invested and can grow tax-free until the donor tells the sponsor which eligible nonprofits to send checks to—at which point there is no deduction. Vanguard's Mr. Pierce estimates there is more than $43 billion in donor-advised charitable funds supervised by more than 750 large sponsors, including universities, regional foundations and independent nonprofits. Irving Plotkin,
an economist and philanthropist in Cambridge, Mass., who has had a charitable account with Vanguard for a decade, said he has tripled his donation so far this year. He added that he might donate again before year-end if Congress imposes deduction limits for 2013. People who donate now are taking a gamble. If lawmakers don't cut the charitable deduction and allow the top tax rate to jump to 39.6% as scheduled in 2013—an unlikely but possible outcome—taking a deduction next year could be more valuable. "I'm willing to risk that," said Mr. Plotkin. Charities and tax advisers are urging donors to use an additional tax break—employed by Warren Buffett and other wealthy taxpayers—that could disappear or be diminished in a fiscal agreement. Under current law, donations of assets that have risen in value, such as shares of stock, often qualify for a deduction at the full market price, enabling donors to skip paying capital-gains tax on the appreciation. With the stock market having recovered much of its losses from 2007-09 and the possibility of deduction limits next year, many advisers say now is a good time to give stock. Elda Di Re, who advises high-net-worth clients at Ernst & Young, said charitable-gift funds are now "part of every giving conversation we have," especially with hedge-fund managers and private-equity investors. "They want to maximize the value of their gifts, so they have plan A and plan B and are ready to pull the trigger depending on what Congress decides." On Wednesday, more than 250 nonprofit-group leaders met with members of Congress to urge them to protect the deduction. Diana Aviv,
president of Independent Sector, an association of nonprofits, said one plan floated by the White House, which would shrink the percentage of donations higher-income taxpayers could deduct from their taxes, could reduce charitable giving by $1.7 billion to $7 billion a year. Another plan, to cap all tax deductions at a specific dollar amount, could hurt giving even more, she said. With uncertainty high, charities are pulling out all the stops. Curt Whipple, a financial adviser in Canton, Mich., said he had lunch recently with Kent Clark,
chief executive of Grace Centers of Hope, a charity to which he has been making monthly donations. "He brought up the fiscal cliff," said Mr. Whipple. Mr. Whipple said he already intended to make an additional gift by year-end, and that the lunch hadn't persuaded him to donate more. Mr. Clark said he is asking other donors to make their gifts before year-end as well. "We need to have a big December," he said.

Vietnam Aims to Cut Trade Deficit With China
By
Vu Trong Khanh
Nov. 12, 2012 5:14 a.m. ET
HANOI—Vietnam is aiming to reduce its trade deficit with China by exporting more farm produce, while also looking for ways to curb smuggling from its neighbor, Minister of Industry and Trade Vu Huy Hoang said Monday. Vietnam's trade deficit with the world's second-largest economy totaled $11.3 billion in the first nine months of the year, while its overall trade surplus came to $34 million during the period, according to government...

is deep into a multipronged effort to build and help run wireless networks in emerging markets as part of a plan to connect a billion or more new people to the Internet. These wireless networks would serve areas such as sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia to dwellers outside of major cities where wired Internet connections aren't available, said people familiar with the strategy. The networks also could be used to improve Internet speeds in urban centers, these people said. Google plans to team up with local telecommunications firms and equipment providers in the emerging markets to develop the networks, as well as create business models to support them, these people said. It is unclear whether Google already has lined up such deals or alliances. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment. In some cases, Google aims to use airwaves reserved for television broadcasts, but only if government regulators allowed it, these people said. More Google to Offer Ultrafast Internet Service in Austin Google Creating Wireless Network, But for What? Google Ramps Up Challenge to Cable Google, Dish Held Talks to Launch Wireless Service The company has begun talking to regulators in countries such as South Africa and Kenya about changing current rules to allow such networks to be built en masse. Some wireless executives say they expect such changes to happen in the coming years. As part of the plan, Google has been working on building an ecosystem of new microprocessors and low-cost smartphones powered by its Android mobile operating system to connect to the wireless networks, these people said. And the Internet search giant has worked on making special balloons or blimps, known as high-altitude platforms, to transmit signals to an area of hundreds of square miles, though such a network would involve frequencies other than the TV broadcast ones. Google has also considered helping to create a satellite-based network, some of these people said. "There's not going to be one technology that will be the silver bullet," meaning that each market will require a unique solution, said one person familiar with Google's plans. The activities underscore how the Web search giant is increasingly aiming to have control over every aspect of a person's connection to the Web across the globe. Enlarge Image
Google is deep into a multipronged effort to build and help run wireless networks in emerging markets.
Reuters The Mountain View, Calif., company now makes its own smartphones and tablets through its Motorola Mobility unit. It owns Android, the most-used mobile operating system for smartphones, and it is also preparing to sell Google Glass, a wearable device for people's faces that it hopes will transform computing. Connecting more people to the Web world-wide creates more potential users of its Web-search engine and other services such as YouTube and its Google Play media and app store. More than half of the world's population doesn't use the Web, particularly in developing nations, researchers say. More Internet users, in turn, would drive online advertising on many of Google's services. The company currently derives 87% of its annual $50 billion in revenue from selling online ads. Google's expansion can also net more data about consumer behavior, which can be used to create more personalized services and target individuals with more relevant advertising, said Narayanan Shivakumar, a former Google engineering executive. And by profiting from data it gleans from how people use a network it operates, Google could build a business more cheaply than traditional carriers do today. Providing wireless networks would allow Google to circumvent incumbent cable companies and wireless carriers. Such companies, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, have clashed with Google, believing it is unfairly reaping profits on the back of their networks. Google has long feared such companies would make it harder for its Web services to work properly on the networks, said people with direct knowledge of the matter. In the U.S., Google has deployed its own fiber-optic cables to wire up homes in cities in Kansas with high-speed Internet and video, and it has plans to do the same in cities in Missouri, Texas and Utah and elsewhere. Google also plans to launch powerful Wi-Fi networks in those markets that piggyback on its wired network, allowing anyone to use their mobile device to access the Web while they are in public spaces, said people familiar with the matter. In mid-2011, Google also engaged in advanced discussions to buy rights to the airwaves, or spectrum, owned by wireless operator Clearwire Corp.
, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The talks ended without a deal as Google pursued its blockbuster acquisition of Motorola

and Verizon Wireless, people familiar with the matter have said. Separately, Google also has made financial investments in Internet-access-related startups such as O3b Networks Ltd. O3b this year will launch special satellites that would broadcast signals to power new networks operated by telecom companies for remote areas of developing countries around the world. The drive to be a vertical player starts at the top of Google. Chief Executive Larry Page
for years has spearheaded secret research on alternative methods to provide more people with Internet access, and has become more active in thinking about providing wireless Internet access to consumers, said people familiar with the matter. The initiatives have since become more serious and are being led by Google's "access" unit, the Google X lab led by Google co-founder Sergey Brin,
and Google.org, the company's nonprofit arm, these people said. Google sees its revenue-generating Web services as "inextricably linked to the infrastructure" of the pipes that bring the Web to people's devices, said David Callisch,

which helps build wireless Internet networks and has worked with Google on Wi-Fi projects. Some of Google's steps toward giving emerging markets wireless access are public, with the company working with other organizations to convince governments in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia to change regulations to create new wireless networks using previously restricted airwaves. Google has long been involved in public trials to prove the technology—which operates at lower frequencies than some cell networks, allowing signals to be more easily transmitted through buildings and other obstacles and across longer distances—can work.

, normally archrivals, have cooperated to bring government leaders and wireless-industry entrepreneurs together to consider ways to open up the broadcast airwaves for public use. Next week, the companies are hosting a two-day conference in Dakar, Senegal, to discuss the issue with regulators from numerous countries. Google has also funded and conducted several small-scale trials, many of them public, involving wireless networks that use TV broadcast airwaves in the U.S. and beyond. Microsoft, which has its own Web services such as Bing search and Skype video chat, also is conducting such trials in Africa. One of Google's trials is in Cape Town, South Africa, involving a "base station" that broadcasts the signals with a range of several miles, and wireless access points, or small boxes that receive the signals. The access points, made by a California company called Carlson Wireless Technologies Inc., are located at 10 elementary schools and high schools and allow thousands of students to receive high-speed Internet access via Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi routers. The system is controlled by Google software that automatically recognizes which TV broadcast airwaves in the area aren't being used at a given moment and can be used for the network. Arno Hart,
who manages the trial on behalf of the Tertiary Education and Research Network of South Africa, which operates wired Internet services for educational institutions, said it began in February and has "gone really, really well." In a blog post last year announcing the trial, Google said the technology was "well-suited to provide low cost connectivity to rural communities with poor telecommunications infrastructure, and for expanding coverage of wireless broadband in densely populated urban areas." For such wireless networks, Google has publicly supported the possibility of using small, inexpensive cellular devices, called "micro cells" that would be located at the access points and would harness the TV airwaves to broadcast the equivalent of a 3G or 4G wireless signal for devices within a quarter-mile radius. —Anton Troianovski contributed to this article.

Lawmakers grilling Mary Jo White,
President Barack Obama's
nominee for chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, on Tuesday will have to weigh two seemingly contradictory versions of the attorney. In one version, Ms. White is a no-holds-barred crime fighter known for stretching the law to jail mob bosses and international terrorists. In another, Ms. White is a friend of Wall Street who worked for the past decade for the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, where she represented giant banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase

Ms. White, 65 years old, in her prepared testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, said the SEC's enforcement "must be bold and unrelenting." Wrongdoers, she said, "will be aggressively and successfully pursued." Her recent background includes advising large securities firms regulated by the SEC. She defended Bank of America Corp.'s

vet John Mack
when it was preparing to name him chief executive in 2005. Ms. White also has argued against pursuing corporations in criminal courts. In February 2012, she said in a panel discussion that prosecutors shouldn't "fail to distinguish between what is actually criminal and what is just mistaken behavior." Ms. White declined to comment. Views she expressed as a Debevoise partner don't necessarily reflect her own opinions, since corporate lawyers are paid to argue the viewpoints of the firms they represent. Several attorneys who worked with Ms. White say her record going after terrorists for nearly a decade, including for the two attacks on the World Trade Center, shows how she will pursue wrongdoers on Wall Street. As U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Ms. White significantly expanded federal laws to go after terrorists and took risks to put terrorists behind bars. Ms. White fought to break down long-standing barriers between government agencies pursuing terrorist cases, including information sharing between the intelligence community and law enforcement, according to Patrick Fitzgerald, one of her top prosecutors. She helped lock up Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, mastermind of the February 1993 World Trade Center bombing and Omar Abdel-Rahman, the "blind sheik" complicit in the Trade Center bombings and a plot to bomb other major U.S. facilities, including the United Nations. When Ms. White first took the job on June 1, 1993, the investigation into the World Trade Center bombing had already begun. She had been briefed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation about an undercover probe into suspected terrorists who were plotting to bomb major U.S. landmarks, said Matthew Fishbein, an attorney who worked alongside Ms. White at the time. In late June, the FBI arrested eight members of the terrorist ring. Sheik Abdel Rahman was later detained on charges of violating immigration laws. Ms. White faced a tough decision: She could indict the Egyptian cleric for plotting to blow up major U.S. landmarks or seek to throw him out of the country for lying on his entry documents. The sheik wasn't an operative in the bomb plot and he had never set foot in the Queens safe house where a group of his followers were caught on videotape mixing a bomb. And prosecutors didn't have today's laws for locking up terrorists before they act to kill Americans. Some high-level law-enforcement officials feared that losing in court would hand the cleric a victory against the U.S. he could use to recruit more followers. Meanwhile, convicting him could turn him into a martyr. Some believed deporting Mr. Abdel Rahman was the "easy out," said Robert Khuzami, the SEC's former enforcement chief who was one of the lead prosecutors on the case. Ms. White, Mr. Khuzami and another prosecutor made the case for indicting the cleric for the plot at a high-level meeting at the Justice Department in Washington, according to people familiar with the meeting. At least two Justice Department officials raised concerns that the case infringed on the sheik's First Amendment rights to free speech. Ms. White got the go-ahead from the administration. After the meeting, she turned to the attorneys who would handle the case and said: "All right, now you better win," according to Mr. Khuzami. Soon after, she charged Mr. Abdel Rahman with violating a Civil War-era statute outlawing plots against the U.S., a law that had been used only once in the modern era. In October 1995, a federal jury convicted Mr. Abdel Rahman for the bomb plot. At about that time, Ms. White started putting together the first full-time terrorism prosecution unit in the country. Prosecutors in the unit flew to Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, Jordan and elsewhere hunting leads on terrorists alongside agents from the FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency, according to Gil Childers, the lead prosecutor in the case against the planners of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. They soon started investigating Osama bin Laden. In 1998, Ms. White charged him with masterminding a conspiracy to blow up U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and with plotting to kill Americans outside the U.S. Write to Scott Patterson at scott.patterson@wsj.com and Jessica Holzer at jessica.holzer@dowjones.com Email

HERAT, Afghanistan—Rokhshana, a 14-year-girl, has been behind bars here since March. She is serving a yearlong adultery sentence after what she describes as rape by her adult cousin, who remains a free man. "I love my country, but there's no justice here," says Rokhshana at Herat's juvenile prison, her arms bearing the signs of beatings. Eleven years after the U.S. ousted the Taliban regime, citing its abuses against women as one of the reasons for the invasion, Afghan women—as well as girls—remain subjected to some of the world's most draconian laws. The U.S.-funded Afghan government of President Hamid Karzai
routinely imprisons wives fleeing domestic abuse and puts raped children like Rokhshana in jail. In part because of international pressure, Afghan women have made some progress in recent years: They can hold office, study in university or walk the streets of big cities without a traditional burqa covering. But, with the U.S.-led coalition withdrawing its troops by 2014, women's activists worry that even those fragile achievements will be sacrificed by Mr. Karzai's administration as he seeks a peace settlement with the Taliban. The Plight of Afghanistan's Women

Lalage Snow for The Wall Street Journal "It's a men's country," says Hawa Alam Nuristani, one of a handful of female members on the High Peace Council, the government body appointed by Mr. Karzai to reach out to the insurgency. "Our only support is from the international community. What is the guarantee that we won't be faced with a similar regime as the Taliban when the Americans withdraw?" The U.S. says women's rights will remain an important issue after the withdrawal, even though American officials acknowledge the limits of their waning influence. "Afghanistan is run by Afghans; we are significant partners," says Melanne Verveer, the U.S. Ambassador at large for global women's issues. "We will continue to ensure that women's rights are pivotal because of our partnership and because it is critical to the future." Such promises fail to allay international observers like Heather Barr, Human Rights Watch's Afghanistan researcher. "We've seen Karzai repeatedly do violent zigzags on women's rights," she says. "The explanation is that he's getting pressure from opposite directions—the international community and conservative elements of Afghan society. But…if that political pressure [from the West] stops, the government's already weak support for women's rights will drop away even more." In March, the Ulema Council, Afghanistan's government-funded supreme religious authority, decreed that Afghan husbands were allowed to beat their wives if they showed disobedience. Mr. Karzai publicly backed the Council's code of conduct. The Ulema Council declined repeated requests for comment. Earlier Kabul's Sex Workers Get Organized 11/9/2012 Presidential spokesman Aimal Faizi said "today's Afghanistan is no more [the] Afghanistan of 10 years back. We do not think that Afghan women are facing more violations of their rights than before. It is the opposite." Girls like Rokhshana, who uses only one name, are the faces of the present reality. Raised in a village outside Herat, western Afghanistan's main city, which is considered one of the country's most liberal, Rokhshana ended up living with her cousin Abdullah, now aged 38, after the death of her father. At the Herat detention center, surrounded by bars, Rokhshana displays an arm with dark blue capillaries under the skin—the hallmarks of beatings by Abdullah, she says. The cousin, who is married with two children, forced her to smoke opium and then regularly raped her since she was 12, she recounts. "I would smoke and I wouldn't know what was happening around me. Life seemed so far away and that's when my cousin would take me," she says, her hennaed hand nervously clutching her veil whenever she spoke. She finally escaped the village in March, fleeing to a nearby police station where she explained her story. Instead of arresting Abdullah, the police locked up Rokhshana herself. Her offense: leaving home unescorted by a male relative. Such conduct is considered a crime by many judges in Afghanistan, who often apply Shariah, or Islamic laws, differently across the country. Weeks later, her complaints of rape and abuse were turned into charges of leaving home and adultery—even though she is unmarried. "When the judge sentenced me he said 'I know you've been forced to have sexual relations but because you're now impure and escaped from home, you need to go to jail,' " she recalled, sitting on a prison bed. The judge in the case, Humayoon Aseel, said he sentenced Rokhshana because she "committed adultery by her consent and repeatedly." Under Afghan law, men committing adultery should also be imprisoned. Mr. Aseel said he also issued a warrant for Abdullah's arrest. Rokhshana says, however, that her cousin has bribed the police to avoid being detained and is now back in the village. Noor Khan Nikzad, the spokesman for Herat police, says the police haven't received any warrant to arrest Abdullah. The police deny any allegations of bribery. The cousin couldn't be reached for comment. Once she is freed from prison, Rokhshana says she hopes to be able to help women like herself find justice. "If I could ask one thing of President Karzai, I'd ask him to let me become a police officer," she says. Abuses against women are also widespread these days in the rural areas controlled by the Taliban insurgents. There have been several cases of women stoned for adultery there in recent years—a punishment that government courts don't impose. In July, a woman accused of adultery in an insurgent-dominated area of Parwan province neighboring Kabul was publicly executed by a gunman who shot her in the back of the head in front of a crowd of cheering villagers. The Afghan government accused the Taliban of staging the execution; the Taliban denied they were behind the killing. Many Afghans worry that the Taliban will return to power once the majority of international troops withdraw in 2014, clawing back what tenuous achievements have been made under U.S. occupation. Like the Parwan execution, they are rattled by the October assassination attempt of Malala Yousafzai, the 14-year-old Pakistani girl shot in the head by a Taliban gunman for promoting girls' education. The Taliban has vowed to hunt down the badly wounded teen again. Though the current Afghan government allows women to study and work, they must remain under the control of their male relatives. Those who flee an abusive home are unable to gain their independence. They usually live a cloistered, hidden life to protect themselves from kin seeking revenge for the dishonor of leaving the home and shaming the family. Some have the option to stay at one of 14 women's shelters scattered across the country that are managed by women's groups with international support. But these places have increasingly come under attack from conservative government officials. Earlier this year, Afghanistan's Justice Minister Habibullah Ghaleb wondered in a parliament speech: "What sort of immorality and prostitution are not happening at those places?" The remarks provoked outrage by European Union and United Nations officials, prompting Mr. Ghaleb to apologize. Government regulations proposed by Afghanistan's women's affairs minister, Husn Banu Ghazanfar, last year would have required the women in the shelters to undergo virginity tests and to justify their stay to a government panel. The proposal was shelved after the United Nations pressured senior Afghan officials, and Western diplomats threatened funding cuts for some Afghan programs. Such intervention won't be as effective once the foreign forces and aid funds are gone after 2014. In mid-September officials from Afghanistan's justice, interior and women's ministries issued a statement clarifying that the running away of women and girls from home isn't a criminal act. But local rights activists are doubtful that the government will release women detained for running away because courts often accuse these women of the intention to commit adultery. "U.N. Women calls upon the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to unconditionally release all women and girls currently detained for 'running away' and for 'attempted adultery' " said an October statement from U.N. Women. Few women locked up under these charges have been released, according to rights activists. Enlarge Image
After running away from home, Sharifa awaits a second arranged marriage.
Lorenzo Tugnoli for The Wall Street Journal Suraya Pakzad, who runs two women's shelters in Afghanistan, says prominent government officials already have repeatedly threatened her, demanding that she expel their female relatives from her safe houses to return home. "I've never had a single problem with the Taliban," she says. "Only these warlords who are in government." Sharifa, a wiry 17-year-old from a small village in remote Daikundi province, spent two years in one of the two shelters run by Ms. Pakzad's organization, Voice of Women. When Sharifa was just 11, her father married her off, in exchange for money, to an 18-year-old man who beat her when she refused his sexual advances and then raped her for the two years their marriage lasted, she says. "I don't know how much I was sold for," Sharifa recalls in a whisper during a recent interview in the Herat shelter, rarely looking up from her teacup. Though child marriages like hers are technically illegal in Afghanistan, they account for some 40% of all weddings, according to the United Nations Children Fund. The dowry the father received helped him manage his farm. When Sharifa's husband sent her back to live with her father, the father had to repay the dowry. He beat Sharifa with even more fury, she says. The father declined to comment. Finally, two years ago, at age 15, Sharifa fled the village, stealing her father's clothes and walking for 48 hours to a highway. There she stood and waited awkwardly with her freshly shorn hair, in the traditional men's clothes, the shalwar kameez, that were too large for her small body. After hitching a ride to Herat, Sharifa found work in a brick kiln for two months. Sleeping and eating among the boys and men in the factory, she woke up one morning to find her secret had been discovered because her period arrived sooner than expected. One of the men asked Sharifa why she was bleeding. Terrified, she says she ran off. Her male colleagues chased after her until she outran them and found a police station. Rather than lock her up, the sympathetic police took Sharifa to a shelter, where she lived for two years, learning embroidery and other skills. "The few months I was a boy it was freedom. I realized how little freedom I had as a girl," she says. Afghan women activists consider her case a success because Sharifa's family has agreed not to kill her to restore their honor. Her uncle Nazer Hussain, who lives in Herat, recently allowed her to live with him while her father, who remains in Daikundi, is arranging another marriage. "Of course she wants to get married! This is what women want," Mr. Hussain said. He confirmed the story of her escape. Marrying a man of her father's choosing is the only way Sharifa can avoid a lifetime in a shelter or time in jail. "I'm angry. My life is so hard and there's no way to make it better," she says in a whisper, half mournful, half defiant. "My family wants me to remarry. The only thing I hope for in life is not to remarry." The plight of Afghan women jailed for so-called moral crimes such as escaping home or adultery began to attract international attention last year, when the European Union funded a documentary on an 18-year-old named Golnaz. She was imprisoned after reporting that her cousin had raped her two years earlier. "What kind of government and justice is this? I'm not a suicide bomber. I'm not a drug addict. I'm a victim," Golnaz said in an interview in Kabul's women's prison at the time. Fearing backlash from conservative Afghans, the EU blocked the release of the documentary—causing a flurry of protests by international activists that eventually prompted Mr. Karzai to pardon Golnaz a year ago. Government officials at the time made it clear she was expected to marry her rapist, who had impregnated her. Recently, Golnaz and her daughter were living in a woman's shelter in Kabul and her mother and brothers were refusing to speak with her, questioning her morality after the case. She is learning how to read and write. But for Golnaz, the likelihood that she will ever leave the shelter or find work to sustain herself and her young daughter is slim. "Women like Golnaz are still stuck with these misogynistic, old school ideas that rule their lives," says Kimberley Motley, a Kabul-based lawyer who represents Golnaz. "In the West, shelters are a half way house to get women on their feet. In Afghanistan, they are the end result." —Habib Khan Totakhil and Ziaulhaq Sultani contributed to this article. Email
