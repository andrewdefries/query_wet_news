CBS Outdoor to Convert Americas Unit to REIT

CBS Corp. (CBS) said it has begun converting its outdoor advertising operating segment in the Americas to a real-estate investment trust and will also divest the segment's business in Europe and Asia, to increase shareholder value. Shares rose 8.9% to $41.10 after hours. The stock is up 37% over the past 12 months. As part of the REIT conversion plan, CBS will submit a request for a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service during the first quarter of this year, it said. If the ruling is granted, the media company could complete the conversion in the taxable year beginning in 2014. The other part of CBS's outdoor business, in Europe and Asia, will be divested and presented as a discontinued operation as of Dec. 31, 2012. Last June, bankers were said to be gauging interest in the outdoor business, which CBS was said to hope would fetch as much as $6 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. William Eccleshare, chief executive of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. (CCO), said at the time that he was interested in looking at the business. French outdoor advertising giant JCDecaux (DEC.FR) said in 2011 that it was considering a bid for CBS Outdoor, but said that it wouldn't overpay. CBS Chief Executive and President Leslie Moonves said Wednesday that the initiatives are intended to "unlock the tremendous value of these unique quality assets." In November, CBS said its third-quarter earnings rose 16% as it benefited from lower interest expenses and as a decline in advertising sales was offset by contributions from other revenue streams. The most-watched broadcaster in the U.S. has reported stronger earnings for more than two years, boosted in recent periods by licensing deals with online-media companies and higher programming fees. CBS is heavily dependent on advertising, but has been diversifying into other revenue streams. Write to Debbie Cai at debbie.cai@dowjones.com Email

i think this question was worded badly. while we have not cut back other costs, we have cut back our cell phone service as it has gotten quite out of hand in terms of overall cost. we have three kids so there are five of us with plans at two different carriers...so we have moved my wife from one carrier to another which is saving us a bit of money. she drops her unlimited data plan in the process which she does not need anyway. i think you will see more and more of this swapping around as more people just start looking for alternatives to paying more and more and more...

Ya Pete.To anyone who remembers $.99/min. flat, and $1.65 for roaming in one of the 150 cities that actually had coverage, we are NOT even PAYING more and more and more.We are BUYING more and more and more, then whining that THEY are "charging us" so much.Can you imagine someone from 1990 complaining that paying for each of the "kids" to have a cell phone was causing "budget problems"? People would laugh and step away.

>75% of people wake up in the morning will check their email. This is a matter of life. This is how we connect to each other now. Technology will speed up the connectivity highway and offers more products which eat into our household budget. Sensible approach is to identify what suits you best and adjust requirement accordingly. This is very much a balancing act.

I have a cheap cell phone on a prepaid card that cost 125 bucks a year. I have a Nexus 7 and only use Wi-Fi. I have Wi-Fi at work but I don't use it as I can wait until I get home.At work I get enough e-mails to deal with and I don't need to add more.

For many people, a 4g enabled smartphone is a luxury they don't need. The should look at the lower end options. However for a person like me, who has been spending hundreds per month for years on home phones, home internet, cell phones, I'm actually paying less. I've gone to IP telephony, having multiple home numbers for 20% of what it used to cost me. When I was paying versizon for DSL and several numbers into my home with full service, I was spending 200/mo just for phones and home internet.Now, I pay a total of 250/mo for: Premium cable with all the movie channels I want, lots of HD, on demand and recorder. Multi line phone service with all features I need. 15 mbps download speed home internet service. And the monthly charge for my Samsung Galaxy II for AT&T. For 25% more ( probably really nothing when you take into account inflation) I get many times more than I used to get. It's a tremendous deal. And I use it. I have a home office and am active on blogs and social media in a variety of contexts, and travel often for my business, so I even have a hotspot on my phone to give me 4g internet service on my laptop. To me, it's amazing and cheap. I mean, I'm walking around with a data/voice/video communicator in my pocket that in most areas where I go, connects me to the world in real time. It's like magic. I grew up with a rotary phone with a cord that my parents wouldn't let me use most of the time to not "tie up the line". Lol, anyone who complains about these costs has disconnected from reality. If you can't afford it or don't need it, that's a different question.

Just the opposite: found ways to cut the cell phone bill.Analyze and reconsider your needs, study coverage maps of different providers, crunch the numbers on various plans (including pay-as-you-go), etc, and you just might save hundreds per year.

The cost I cut is the subscription payment for WSJ. That was like flushing money down the can.

I paid for the subscription and have a little free time here and there, but that's some biting insight you possess.

Huh? You wrote that you cut your subscription to the WSJ. The subscription was "like flushing money down the the can"And then today you write that you paid for the subscription.Either you're irrational, or need to work on your writing skills to clarify what you mean.

Well, Donald, maybe I should be more thorough and less pithy. I paid before. I'm not paying again. Right now, I'm not paying per use, because I've already paid. More clear? Either way, it was sarcasm that must have walked by you without stopping.

"Right now, I'm not paying per use, because I've already paid. More clear?"No.1. Given that you're currently a paid subscriber, you haven't cut any costs, yet. You'll only save money by not re-subscribing in the future.2. The fact that you continue to read the WSJ, and participate in discussions here, proves you see value in it. Ergo, it's not "like flushing money down the can" to you. You may have decided the price isn't worth the benefit, but it's not worth zero to you, or you wouldn't be here.

Yes... I consolidated all cell phone accounts into one, my wife and I have 3 boys, two in college and one in graduate school and limit the minutes my teenagers have to text. Since I have a package deal I have a home phone used as a backup and I use it rarely. I was able to convince my carrier of that and got the charge down to $3 a month. I have High Speed internet and have not cut back on that but I have returned all the additional TV boxes with the exception of one to my carrier. One son has a Netflix account and we use it sparingly. I am planning to end all TV cable soon because I have smart TVs and just use our computers to watch the news or Google information we need. As a result I have gotten my media bill down well below $100 where it used to be $250 and we feel we have sacrifced nothing. Also we have a Kindle HD and download freebooks constantly or borrow one at a time many of them NYT's bestsellers.

This is not really a good question.You might as well ask, "Have you had to sacrifice something because your rent went up?""... because the price of gasoline went up?""... because the Cable TV bill went up?""... because the price of a Big Mac went up?"We all have to adjust our expenses and decide what things we want to buy with our finite resources. Telephone service is just one more expense in the mix.

With today's health insurance environment, I don't know that I would try using cheaper hookers, if you get my drift, Geraldo. ;)

I want to know how those kids pay for those sneakers.Converse served the "needs" of my generation just fine. And that additional $190 these kids are paying must have come out of SOME other expense.

The fact that this question is even being posed in this way indicates that our priorities as a culture are out of whack. Were feeding a family at stake, it should be a given that things like cell phones would go first.Another example illustrating this type of thinking is the (??federal??) program that provides cell phones to low income folks. Now, I'm all in favor of programs to uplift folks from poverty and I am normally quite liberal about such issues. I have even argued in the forums of the WSJ in the past about the long established subsidies to help provide fixed land lines in low income homes. That goes by way of saving lives in emergencies and even helping folks to find and keep jobs. While I understand that low income folks do enjoy this benefit, it does not rise to the level of need and is wasteful in our current fiscal mess.I have digressed a bit from the topic at hand, and beg your indulgence. So please accept this as the bottom line: technology is a wonderful thing and sometimes can be expensive. A truly free market will eventually bring those prices down through competition. To think, though, that our culture places the "mandatory" label on something like a cell phone to the point that more necessary, fundamental items are sacrificed is just plain wrong.

Can't text and can't send data. Too cheap. Rather spend my money on power tools and camera equipment.

TOKYO—Souring relations between Japan and China, which suffered another blow Wednesday when China's central-bank governor and finance minister pulled out of a high-profile gathering of global finance chiefs in Tokyo, are starting to cause serious economic damage that could deepen if passions stay high, investors, analysts and politicians here warned. The revelation that China's two highest-level delegates had withdrawn from the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Tokyo amid an escalating...

Web Video Companies Crank Up Lobbying By
Amy Schatz
Updated June 13, 2012 8:21 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—Online video companies are ramping up their lobbying of lawmakers and regulators, but their adversaries—traditional cable-TV companies and Internet-service providers—have far deeper pockets on K Street. Both Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are on pace to sharply increase the amount of money they spend on lobbying this year. They have added veteran Washington hands to help them in the capital, where Comcast Corp. and other...

Transgender Students Get New Options in California
School Districts Grapple With Newly Enacted Law That Spells Out Rights
By
Alejandro Lazo
Updated Jan. 22, 2014 7:27 p.m. ET
SACRAMENTO, Calif.—School districts in California are grappling with a newly enacted, first-of-its-kind law that spells out rights for those students who don't identify as being the gender of their birth. California law AB 1266, the first such statewide legislation in the country, grants students who identify themselves as transgender the right to choose the sports teams and extracurricular activities—as well as the bathrooms and locker rooms—that correspond to their gender identities. Backers of the measure say...

Low Spirits Sap Champagne Sales
By
Marion Issard
Updated Dec. 4, 2012 6:36 a.m. ET
The Champagne corks aren't exactly popping. In the first nine months of this year, shipments of the sparkling French wine fell 5% as the recession across much of Europe and the cooling of the luxury-goods boom took their toll. Consumption is expected to pick up going into the end of the year, the traditional peak season for bubbly, but...
