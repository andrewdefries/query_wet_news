Biography
October 8, 2013
In his Capital Journal column Gerald Seib, The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau chief, identifies the central metaphor guiding the Democrats' thinking about the current impasse over spending and the impending one over debt: It's called "break the fever." Breaking the fever is code for ending the cycle of recurring, last-minute crises over spending bills and increases in the nation's borrowing limit—the debt ceiling. The White House believes these crises give outsize power to a minority of conservative House Republicans who don't have the strength to push their agenda into law but can, in a crisis, stop the action. More important, Democrats are convinced they must break the cycle now, or see much of the Obama second-term agenda sink away. This is an old metaphor for the president. In January 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama was quoted as saying: "Part of my job as the next president is to break the fever of fear that has been exploited by this administration. We are told to be afraid of terrorists, immigrants and each other. This becomes the means by which our civil liberties are subverted and our values are distorted." He added: "We should show a willingness to speak to our adversaries," which is rather different from his approach today. But the domestic application of the fever metaphor goes back at least to April 2012, when he gave the following answer when Rolling Stone's Jann Wenner asked him how to "break through" Republican "obstructionism": My hope is that if the American people send a message to them that's consistent with the fact that Congress is polling at 13 percent right now, and they suffer some losses in this next election, that there's going to be some self-reflection going on--that it might break the fever. They might say to themselves, "You know what, we've lost our way here. We need to refocus on trying to get things done for the American people." At a June campaign appearance in Minnesota, he reiterated: Now, I believe that if we're successful in this election--when we're successful in this election--that the fever may break, because there's a tradition in the Republican Party of more common sense than that. My hope and my expectation is that after the election, now that it turns out the goal of beating Obama doesn't make much sense because I'm not running again--that we can start getting some cooperation again. What the 2008 version of the metaphor and the 2012-13 one have in common is that in both cases the "fever" is a phenomenon external to Obama. That's important, but perhaps not in precisely the way the president thinks. Enlarge Image
A fever breaking
Getty Images/iStockphoto To make sense of the metaphor, let's think about literal fevers. "A fever is usually a sign that something out of the ordinary is going on in your body," explains the Mayo Clinic website. "For an adult, a fever may be uncomfortable, but fever usually isn't dangerous unless it reaches 103 F (39.4 C) or higher." "Fevers have an adaptive function," notes John Durant in his new book, "The Paleo Manifesto: Ancient Wisdom for Lifelong Health": "A fever is a natural immune response to infection, not just an unpleasant side effect of being ill. Fever isn't a bug, it's a feature." When the infection is gone, the fever "breaks" as the body's temperature returns to normal. So if America's body politic continues to run a fever, that means it is still suffering from the underlying illness. And if the Republicans are fevered--or are the fever--then it follows that Obama and the Democrats are the infectious agent. When you think about it this way, the metaphor makes perfect sense. The body politic heated up during 2009 and 2010, as Obama overcame its resistance and advanced his agenda. The 2010 election was a massive immune response, which seemed to have restored a measure of health. By 2012, when both Obama and House Republicans were re-elected, the fever seemed to have broken on its own. Instead, as we now know, the Internal Revenue Service administered an anti-inflammatory treatment that merely masked the symptoms of the underlying infection. Taking a longer view, one could see America's current condition as a chronic one, which has gradually grown worse over decades. "Chronic infections become chronic in the first place due to an insufficient initial immune response," Durant notes. If a virulent strain of the bug has now produced an acute fever, it may be a sign that the country has some vigor left. Cower to the People Laura Clawson, a writer for the hard-left Daily Kos website, has a curious explanation for the government-shutdown standoff. She notes a CNN report claiming that a majority of House members, necessarily including some Republicans, "support passing a continuing resolution with no additional legislative strings attached that would reopen the federal government"--but they "have not indicated a willingness" to "force" a vote on the matter. Here's Clawson: That's an extremely, uh, polite way of putting it: They "have not indicated a willingness." To put it another way, some Republicans from relatively swingy districts realize this could spell trouble for them in the general election, but they're not willing to risk a well-funded challenge from the right in the Republican primary. . . . The Republicans who would so vote are too afraid to push Boehner, while the extremist vandal caucus is in no way afraid to push him to keep the government closed and probably force the nation into default on top of it, and he's under their sway. The continuing shutdown, in short, is because the Republican caucus is composed of the most poisonous possible mixture of bullies and cowards. OK, but if you look at it that way, doesn't exactly the same dynamic explain how we got stuck with ObamaCare? 'Male Privilege' Math is hard, at least if you're Matthew Yglesias. The author of Slate's Moneybox blog looks at a new study from Pew Social Trends analyzing "time-use statistics" of parents who live with their children. It finds, unsurprisingly, that "dads spend more time doing paid work in the market while moms spend more time doing unpaid household work and childcare tasks": What's a bit more interesting is that alongside this household division of labor there's the fact that men spend an extra three hours a week engaged in leisure activities. That's your male privilege, in other words, quite apart from any thoughts about specialization. Then if you scroll down further you'll see a chart where we learn specifically that dads spend 2.8 more hours per week watching television than moms do. Yglesias's claim of "male privilege" is completely unwarranted, for he neglects to take into account an obvious reason why the male and female samples are not comparable. The Pew comparisons are "based on ratings of adults aged 18 to 64 with [their] own child(ren) under age 18 living in the household." Yglesias evidently imagines these are all traditional households, in which mom, dad and the kids all live under the same roof. And of course such households do still exist, especially among affluent families. (The survey could also include either parent in a household in which two unmarried parents cohabit.) But these days there are lots of children who live with only one parent, either because Mom and Dad are divorced or because they never married to begin with. The vast majority of those children live with their mothers rather than with their fathers. Thus the mothers in the Pew study are far likelier than the fathers to be in a single-parent household. The pertinent comparison is not between fathers and mothers but between similarly situated fathers and mothers--i.e., between married parents of each sex. Single parenthood is, to be sure, a mixed blessing, but as we've noted before, you rarely see divorced couples battling to stick each other with the kids. Thus what Yglesias calls "male privilege" is almost certainly a byproduct of female privilege, in the form of favorable laws and practices regarding child custody.

"White House Press Secretary Jay Carney admitted to reporters on Monday that there were still problems with the federal Obamacare website for health care exchanges," the Washington Examiner reports: Carney said government engineers were working on the problem, but continued to blame the high volume of online traffic for the difficulties experienced on the site. "CMS has put up a gate at the front end of the system that places visitors in a waiting room and lets them in at a particular pace so that the surge in volume does not cause the problems that it caused in the past," Carney said during Monday's White House press briefing.

The U.S. economy expanded significantly faster than initially estimated in the third quarter as businesses fattened their inventories, a factor that is likely to weigh on growth in the year's final quarter.

John McCain Takes on Vladimir Putin in Pravda
Sept. 19, 2013 6:49 p.m. ET
From Sen. John McCain's online commentary for Pravda.ru, Sept. 19: President Putin claims his purpose is to restore Russia to greatness at home and among the nations of the world. But by what measure has he restored your greatness? He has given you an economy that is based almost entirely on a few natural resources that will rise and fall with those commodities. Its riches will not last. And, while they do, they will be...

The gods of golf in pursuit of the Masters' green jacket will know every blade of grass, each magnolia tree and the exact topography of all the greens on the Augusta National course. And it'll still catch most of them out. I know exactly how they feel. Enlarge Image
A TIGER IN YOUR TANK: The latest version of 'Tiger Woods PGA Tour' lets you battle the greats.
EA Sports Not that I've ever actually driven onto the hallowed fairways; instead, I've spent probably far too long playing "Tiger Woods PGA Tour" on my Xbox 360. This is a simulation that really does capture much of the detail and frustration of the real game. OK, it's not quite as hard—would that I could actually drive over 300 yards off the tee—but my putting is every bit as erratic on screen as it is on grass. To appreciate the game properly, opt for "Career Mode," which takes you through amateur and professional tournaments, collecting new skills, equipment and items of clothing as you go. Playing on 20 courses in varying weather conditions, including against friends or other online "Country Club" members, offers at least as many variations as the real thing. More on the Masters Georgia on My Mind Gadgets: The Sweet Spot Continuous coverage The console game's biggest weakness is that it's a victim of its own success. Back in 1999, publisher EA Sports neatly translated the sport from a hefty bag of clubs to a little game pad. Incremental improvements have been made, including to swing mechanics in this edition, but there's little room left for dramatic change. For the latest outing, the main addition is the "Legends of the Majors" mode, in which you compete against greats like Seve Ballesteros,
Jack Nicklaus
and Arnold Palmer,
using vintage equipment on courses as they were at the time. It's fun, but not really a compelling reason to upgrade if you already own the game. If, on the other hand, watching sports on TV makes you want to rush out into the garden and pretend to be one of your heroes, "Tiger Woods PGA" offers a decent grown-up alternative. It remains really the only console golf simulator on the market worth considering. "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14" is available for Xbox 360 and PS3, £40/€60. Email

Provocations Escalate on Korean Peninsula
By
Alastair Gale
Updated March 8, 2013 7:25 p.m. ET
SEOUL—The two Koreas escalated mutual threats on Friday, in an early test of South Korean President Park Geun-hye's pledge to open a new era of trust with the North. A day after the U.N. Security Council imposed stricter sanctions on North Korea in response to its Feb. 12 nuclear test, Pyongyang said it would sever its main hotline with South Korea and scrap agreements on peaceful resolution of conflict, including a 1991 pact that...
