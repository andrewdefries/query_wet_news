Sheila Bair,
who is stepping down as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. this week, leaves behind an agency transformed from a sleepy bank overseer into a financial regulatory powerhouse focused on preventing another financial crisis. At her last FDIC meeting Wednesday, the agency finalized a rule allowing the government to recover compensation from executives responsible for a financial firm's collapse. The rule is one of many Ms. Bair successfully pushed through in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to try and mitigate risk-taking by financial firms and their leaders. Enlarge Image
INCOMING AND OUTGOING: Martin Gruenberg and Sheila Bair, at an FDIC board meeting on Wednesday.
Bloomberg Her aggressive, sometimes combative style helped win broad new powers and an international profile for the FDIC, including the ability to police, take over and dismantle large, complex financial institutions that were never before in the agency's purview. At the same time, she has managed to draw praise from Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill—a notable feat in a partisan town and something that has helped empower the FDIC. "She's had a positive effect on the agency in terms of raising its profile and energy level," said William Isaac,
a former FDIC chairman. Ms. Bair is not without critics. She has ruffled feathers in the banking sector and among fellow regulators and taken some controversial steps, including seizing Washington Mutual Inc. in a move the bank's shareholders and bondholders said was unnecessary. Also, some lawmakers and business groups are trying to weaken or derail some of the rules the FDIC gained in last year's Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul. Regulators are under increasing pressure from Capitol Hill to adopt a slower approach and observers say the FDIC's next chairman will likely face threats to maintaining the agency's newfound power. More Quotes: Sheila Bair's Blunt Talk The Big Interview: Sheila Bair Opinion Journal: Sheila Bair on Risks in American Finance At the same time, some wonder whether Ms. Bair has bitten off more than the FDIC can chew. Among its new responsibilities under Dodd-Frank is to take over and wind down large, complex financial firms that run into trouble. The FDIC, which insures deposits at more than 7,500 banks, gained the authority because of its experience shutting down depository institutions that go bust. Critics say there is a big difference between trying to dismantle a small regional bank and a behemoth like Lehman Brothers or American International Group Inc.

"They clearly are very good at closing small banks on a Friday afternoon, but they don't have the institutional memory or capacity to close a complicated bank," said Cornelius Hurley,
director of the Morin Center for Banking and Financial Law at Boston University. While Ms. Bair leaves the FDIC a more muscular agency than the one she joined in 2006, her departure comes at a critical moment in the government's effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. President Obama has tapped Martin Gruenberg,
the FDIC's vice-chairman, to succeed Ms. Bair as chairman, a position that requires Senate confirmation. The banking industry, which has been fighting many of Ms. Bair's policy initiatives, isn't anticipating a change in direction if Mr. Gruenberg is confirmed. "Philosophically, he and Chairman Bair are cut from the same cloth," said Scott Talbott,
top lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable trade group. Mr. Gruenberg has won the endorsement of some key Republican and Democratic lawmakers. Those who know Mr. Gruenberg and Ms. Bair say their personalities and approaches are different. Mr. Gruenberg is described as having strong views and a stubborn streak but as someone who listens to dissenting opinions and presses his case in a more soft-spoken manner than Ms. Bair. The FDIC declined to make Ms. Bair or Mr. Gruenberg available for interviews. Ms. Bair, a Republican appointed by President George W. Bush, played a key role in many of the government's actions to stem the financial crisis and in the process angered many in the banking industry. During the crisis, Ms. Bair endorsed a deal in which Wells Fargo & Co.

that included a provision for the government to potentially absorb hundreds of billions of dollars in Wachovia losses. The Wells deal had no such provision. Citigroup filed lawsuits against Wells Fargo and Wachovia and many Citigroup executives came to view the deal's demise as one of the reasons Citigroup eventually needed a government bailout. The deal's collapse prompted Vikram Pandit,
Citigroup's CEO, to launch into a profanity-laced tirade about Ms. Bair during a conference call with Citi officials, according to people familiar with the call. A Citi representative denies that Mr. Pandit had such a conversation. The House Bair Built The FDIC's powers have expanded greatly as part of last year's Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Many of the provisions were inserted at Chairman Sheila Bair's behest. Here are some of the agency's newfound powers: 'Living wills'— requires large banks and nonbank financial firms to deliver a map on how to wind them down in a crisis Expanded seizure power— allows for takeover of large banks and financial institutions in danger of failing, not just smaller regional banks 'Backup supervision'— allows for placement of on-site analysts at institutions with $50 billion or more in assets 'Clawbacks'— recovers pay from executives deemed "substantially responsible" for a financial firm's failure Some months later, she pushed for a management shakeup at Citigroup. Ms. Bair has also incited the ire of fellow policy makers, including Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and his predecessor, Henry Paulson, over matters stemming from the financial crisis and the regulatory overhaul. In the process, she transformed the agency into a tough cop that FDIC officials say now has the tools to help prevent another financial crisis. "The FDIC has more authority now than what it had before and that's useful to ensure that the financial system and taxpayers aren't exposed to the same risks that they were exposed to in 2008—namely, risks arising from bailouts or severe market disruption," said Jim Wigand,
director of the FDIC's new Office of Complex Financial Institutions. Enlarge Image
Sheila Bair during a hearing of the FDIC on Wednesday.
Bloomberg Among the FDIC's newfound powers is to install examiners at financial firms to monitor their operations, providing so-called backup supervision to the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The FDIC plans to place "analysts" at most of the firms it now oversees at some point during the course of a year, according to agency officials. It's also working on a rule requiring banks with over $50 billion in assets and other large, nonbank financial firms to provide a roadmap, known as a "living will," to help regulators quickly and cleanly dismantle a firm in the event of a crisis. The FDIC in March approved a draft rule requiring the firms to submit resolution plans, with regular updates and reports on the firms' credit exposure to regulators. The proposal, which many expected to be finalized this week, is expected to be finished in August, Ms. Bair said. —Alan Zibel contributed to this article.

SALEM, Mass.—There's a certain look and feel to a foreclosed home, and 31 Arbella St. has it: fraying carpet, missing appliances, foam insulation poking through cracked walls. That doesn't faze buyer Tony Barletta since he plans a gut renovation anyway. It's the bad vibes that bother him. So two weeks before closing, Mr. Barletta followed witch Lori Bruno and warlock Christian Day through the three-story home. They clanged bells and sprayed holy water, poured kosher salt on doorways and raised iron swords at windows. Cleansing Foreclosed Homes of Bad Vibes
View Slideshow
Lori Bruno, right, who claims to be a descendant of 16th-century Italian witches, performed a blessing on a home in Salem, as warlock Christian Day, left, assisted.
Christopher Capozziello for The Wall Street Journal More photos and interactive graphics "Residue, residue, residue is in this house. It has to come out," shouted Ms. Bruno, a 70-year-old who claims to be a descendant of 16th-century Italian witches. "Lord of fire, lord flame, blessed be thy holy name...All negativity must be gone!" The foreclosure crisis has helped resurrect an ancient tradition: the house cleansing. Buyers such as Mr. Barletta are turning to witches, psychics, priests and feng shui consultants, among others, to bless or exorcise dwellings. Sellers, too, are adopting the trend to help move a property stuck on the market. In recent months, foreclosure and other distressed sales have represented about a third of all home sales, according to the National Association of Realtors. With so many foreclosures riddling the market, some buyers find that a coat of paint is hardly enough to rid a house of its creepy quotient. "It's not entities or ghosts that we're dealing with anymore," says Julie Belmont, a so-called intuitive who works in Orange County, Calif., where 40% of home sales last year were distress sales. "With foreclosures, a lot of it is energy imprints from past discussions, arguments, money problems. All of that is absorbed by the house." Lori Bruno
Homeowners of various faiths have turned to different rituals—called house cleansings or space clearings—for centuries. Catholics and Hindus, for example, might ask a priest to bless a new home before moving in. Before their new year, the Chinese cleanse the home to sweep away any bad luck accumulated over the past twelve months. Ms. Bruno's process pulls from a few methods: Ringing bells, she says, breaks up the negative energy of a place. Iron keeps evil spirits away, says Mr. Day, brandishing a sword across the living room. Mr. Barletta heard about the pair through his real-estate agent after his offer on the home was accepted. "I'm a spiritual person," he says. "I just wanted to remove the negative energy first." In Salem, the site of the 1692 witch trials, the occult is a part of the everyday, from the high-school sports team known as the Witches to entrepreneurs such as Mr. Day and Ms. Bruno. He owns the Hex Old World Witchery magic shop downtown and she gives psychic readings there. "It's a very spiritual city," says Salem real-estate agent Janet Andrews Howcroft. But the city's real-estate market hasn't been so charmed. Home prices here fell by about a third in the past two years, according to Ms. Howcroft. And Essex, the county that Salem calls home, had the state's second-highest foreclosure level in October, says the Warren Group, which tracks real-estate data in New England. In Salem, Mass., the high foreclosure rate is giving new life to an ancient practice: house cleansings performed by a witch to rid your home of bad vibes. WSJ's S. Mitra Kalita reports.
Ms. Howcroft attributes recent requests for house blessings in part to the economic picture here. She counted at least eight transactions last year that involved a house cleansing, compared to the occasional request in prior years. The house on Arbella Street is under contract for $167,000, and was appraised for nearly double, pending renovations. But, Ms. Bruno cautioned, that bargain comes with a price. She gestured toward an empty room with "Mike, Age 13" scrawled on the wall in child's handwriting. "If someone took your home away, how would you feel?" Taking her cleansing agent of kosher salt in a bowl of water and lighting a candle, she led the group—including the buyer's agent—up the stairs. Arriving at the upstairs kitchen, gutted of its cabinetry and appliances, Ms. Bruno yelled into the air: "You will not hurt anything I hold dear. I am the exorcist of your garbage!" She is quick to distinguish her services from that of a plain-vanilla psychic. "Unlike psychics, witches know you can change the future," she explains. They might be described as good witches. Ms. Bruno, who feels she is well compensated for her readings, doesn't charge for her house cleansings—she's done more than 100, she says. Rather, she considers them to be a form of charity work. "I don't want to live off people's sadness," she says. Fellow Salem witch Lillee Allee also performs house blessings and, like Ms. Bruno, she doesn't take a fee. Elsewhere, others are viewing the rituals as a real business opportunity. Austin, Texas-based feng shui consultant Logynn B. Northrhip is teaming up with Scottsdale, Ariz., real-estate agent Jason Goldberg to offer a package of services to create better vibes in a home, either before sale or after purchase. The two met at a yoga retreat. In Sacramento, Calif., realtor Tamara Dorris also used feng shui to help speed the sale of a property that had been on the market for more than a year. She placed a jade plant, believed to bring good financial luck, in a "prosperity corner" and waited. "Within two weeks, I had two offers," she says. "Most homes have at least one or two prosperity flaws. Foreclosed homes have five or six flaws." Sometimes, it's bad feng shui to even attempt to buy a foreclosure. That was Grace Lee's discovery as she toured 30 houses in the San Diego area, her consultant Simona Mainini in tow, to find a new home. In the end, Ms. Mainini just advised her to buy new construction, saying it would save her money on repairs and other troubles in the long run. "You can keep looking for deals in distressed properties," Ms. Mainini recalls telling her client. "But they all have an energy that is very weak for money." Email

chief will earn $20,000 for any day he spends four hours advising his longtime employer. That means hypothetically he could pocket $400,000 a year for 20 half-days of work—twice what his predecessor, Louis V. Gerstner Jr.
, makes per day under a similar consulting arrangement. Mr. Palmisano's contract is open-ended and doesn't specify the number of days he will work. Mr. Gerstner's 10-year consulting contract expires in March. Many former executives enjoy lucrative consulting gigs at their old companies. Boards dole out these agreements to guarantee smooth leadership transitions and prevent former bosses from joining a rival, poaching staffers or filing suit against the company. Companies have paid key former executives as consultants since at least the 1970s, and the practice gained acceptance because boards wanted continued access to those ex-officials' knowledge, according to several executive-pay attorneys. In some cases, the deals are so generous that they go beyond the grave—such as the consulting accord for Phillip "Rick" Powell,
who stepped down as CEO of First Cash Financial Services Inc.

in 2005. Under Mr. Powell's consulting contract, the operator of pawn shops and check-cashing stores was required to pay $3.5 million in consulting fees if Mr. Powell had died during 2011, the company's latest proxy said. (The 62-year-old Mr. Powell, who has been fighting U.S. charges of illegal insider trading since last year, remains alive and well.) The controversial perquisite bothers some activist investors, especially because these deals are sometimes made when a company is nudging an executive out the door. "Consulting agreements often are a hidden substitute for severance pay," says Brandon Rees,
head of the AFL-CIO's Office of Investment. "Their questionable value will influence how shareholders vote on executive pay in the 2013 proxy season." Consulting arrangements have fallen in popularity among CEOs over the past decade, but are gaining traction for other departing C-suite leaders, according to analyses for The Wall Street Journal. In the five years ended Aug. 1, 16 former leaders of the nation's 1,000 biggest concerns took home at least $500,000 in consulting fees, concludes Equilar Inc., a pay-research firm. That compares with 28 retired chiefs making that much between 1996 and 2001, a previous WSJ study found. Yet "there's a general upward trend" since 2007 in the number of consulting contracts for other senior executives, such as finance chiefs or general counsel, reports Theo Francis,
an independent compensation researcher. He reviewed nearly 300 such agreements for the Journal. Just a tiny fraction require a minimum workload—7 of 174 recently disclosed executive consulting agreements, according to a separate study by Mr. Francis.

$50,000 per quarter through mid-2014 for consulting services—and a maximum of 200 hours a year, according to a regulatory filing. The senior vice president retired in June at age 57 after more than three decades with the company, and says he chose to limit his hours because he didn't want an "onerous" obligation. He estimates he spent nearly 50 hours counseling former colleagues this summer, such as helping a European team with planning. Smooth transitions are a big part of the plan. Advice from a predecessor proved useful during James D. Wehr's
initial months as chief executive of insurer Phoenix Cos.

Dona D. Young, his predecessor, received $300,000 for a year of consulting but was fully paid six months after she retired in 2009. "Dona helped me transition into my new role and expand my relationships inside and outside the company,'' Mr. Wehr recalled. Thomas Johnson,

, Scott Carson
retired in January 2010 after running its commercial airplanes unit. He earned about $1.5 million for advising Boeing no more than 75 hours a month. The two-year contract expired last March. Mr. Carson's replacement, Jim Albaugh,
"had relatively limited experience with our commercial customers," and so the former executive "provided continuity," a company spokesman says. Mr. Carson says he attended aircraft-delivery events and accompanied colleagues to complete sales, including one in Ethiopia. But he never consulted the maximum amount per month, the retired executive says. And "in the last six months, it was nothing"—even though he received his full fee. The transition "ended up being a bit shorter than we estimated," the Boeing spokesman explains. Mr. Carson now chairs the board of regents for Washington State University, among other things.

finance chief who won a post-retirement consulting gig took an unusual approach after he no longer felt needed. Fredric G. Reynolds was due $100,000 a month for three months after leaving the media concern in August 2009, followed by $60,000 a month through August 2010. Mr. Reynolds says he assisted his longtime employer with U.K. outdoor billboard deals, among other things. By early 2010, however, he stopped being busy for CBS, he recalls. "I couldn't justify doing this [consulting] through August," he says. CBS accepted Mr. Reynolds's request, halting payments in late February, a spokesman says. Former executives rarely cut short their consulting gigs, however. Mr. Reynolds says boards should be more skeptical of such arrangements. "It's a way to get people to move on," he notes. "But it doesn't wind up being very productive." On the other hand, some companies swear by their prior leader's ongoing advice. First Cash's Mr. Powell has advised it since he stepped down as CEO seven years ago. He initially got a $500,000 annual fee. Since April 2010, he has earned $700,000 a year under an arrangement that directors extended from 2014 through 2016. First Cash continues to perform well partly thanks to his strategic involvement in areas such as management, acquisitions and store expansion, says CEO Rick Wessel.
Last month, a U.S. district judge threw out illegal insider trading charges from a June 2011 lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission that accused Mr. Powell of buying 100,000 First Cash shares after learning about a stock buyback plan. A trial may still occur next year on related other charges that Mr. Powell didn't disclose his share purchase for more than a year and only after he learned about the SEC's probe. "Mr. Powell has vehemently denied any wrongdoing,'' said Jason S. Lewis,
his attorney. Corrections & Amplifications Dona D. Young, a former CEO of Phoenix Cos., received $300,000 for a year of consulting but was fully paid within six months after she retired in 2009. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said she consulted for six months after retiring. Write to Joan S. Lublin at joan.lublin@wsj.com Email

Apple pushed out vice president Richard Williamson for its mapping service about two weeks ago, according to people briefed on the matter, as the company tries to recover from the map service's rocky debut. Arik Hesseldahl reports. Photo: AP Images.
The vice president, Richard Williamson, had been a senior leader with Apple's iOS mobile software team. During his tenure, he oversaw a variety of services, including at one point Apple's voice-activated assistant Siri. Mr. Williamson's boss, iPhone software chief Scott Forstall,
was pushed out of Apple in October, also on the heels of the maps imbroglio. Apple released its new maps application as part of its latest iOS 6 mobile operating system in September. Criticism poured in world-wide as users of the new Apple maps found misplaced location markers and bizarre satellite images. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook
later apologized for the frustration the maps software had caused. Mr. Williamson couldn't be reached for comment. Bloomberg earlier reported that Mr. Williamson was pushed out of the company.

People reunite, separate, rush and wait at Grand Central Terminal earlier this month—much as they have over the last century. Click the image above to see more photos of everyday life at the station, captured by WSJ's Kurt Wilberding ahead of the centennial.
It was the ribbed seam on the back of a stocking that inspired Leo Ackerman
to tap a young woman on the shoulder in the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal in 1948 and ask her what she was doing later that evening. Mollie Zessin,
then 24 years old, replied that she would be attending a Jewish dance at the Metropolitan Club and coyly told him he could join her. Mr. Ackerman, the dashing owner of a male modeling agency and an occasional hat model himself, kept the date. Three months later, they were married. Video: Grand Central Time-Lapse
Rushing commuters, confused tourists, and headphone-wearing travelers all comprise the average day at Grand Central Terminal. WSJ's Keith Bedford captured the sights and sounds this week in a time-lapse video to mark the train station's centennial.

Below Grand Central, Digging for the Future
Deep below Midtown Manhattan, the $8.2 billion East Side Access project is making progress as it excavates a sprawling set of caverns and tunnels below Grand Central Terminal that will become a Long Island Rail Road station and concourse by 2019. WSJ's Jennifer Weiss reports.
From Metropolis Rethinking Grand Central's Crowded Second Century More on Grand Central's Future Grand Central Terminal, a birthplace of modern commuting celebrating its 100th birthday on Friday, stands as a symbol of the comings and goings of the city and the nation—the scene of more boisterous hellos and tearful goodbyes than can be counted. Ten decades of meetings and greetings have inspired generations of photographers and writers who have immortalized the station in works ranging from Alfred Hitchcock's
"North by Northwest" to the TV show "Gossip Girl." The building has become enmeshed in the emotional memories of the masses who pass through it. Mr. Ackerman retold the story of his life-changing encounter at the landmark station so many times that the tale has become the stuff of family lore. "The last time I saw my grandfather before he died, he told me again about meeting my grandmother in Grand Central," said Ruthie Ackerman, his granddaughter. "I love the idea that a bold young man and a stylish woman in ribbed stockings can meet and fall in love in the same place I pass through every day to get to work." "It's such a transient space with people coming and going," she added, "it still amazes me that people slow down long enough to fall in love." Katherine Oliver,
commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment, describes the terminal as one of the more sought-after locations for filming in New York City. Last year, officials said, approximately 500 permits were issued for filming and photography inside Grand Central. "It creates the backdrop for an emotional scene for someone anxiously awaiting a loved one or bidding farewell," Ms. Oliver said. From 1915 until the 1990s, the Beaux Arts building even contained a special place apart from the hustle and bustle of the main floor that was designated for loved ones in the throes of an extra special hello. An area adjacent to the arriving long-distance trains—officially dubbed the Incoming Train Room—hosted reunions between sweethearts and military men returning from war. "Everyone was greeting people from around the country, so obviously there was a lot of kissing going on there," said Metro-North spokeswoman Marjorie Anders, explaining how the room acquired its more famous moniker: "The Kissing Room."

Lindsey Green has always loved Grand Central. And now, as a New Yorker displaced from her home by superstorm Sandy, she goes there to feel a moment of calm.
Daniella Zalcman for The Wall Street Journal Transit officials are hoping to bring back more of the kissing in 2019, when a massive expansion to the station in the $8.2 billion East Side Access megaproject adds a pair of escalators that will once again make it a meeting spot. When Cynthia MacGregor's
parents took her to Grand Central before summer camp each July from 1954 to 1959, the last thing she wanted was a kiss. "I totally ignored my parents the second we got into Grand Central," she recalled. Instead, she was busy looking for her bunkmates—and she can still recite their names: Terry, Rosemary, Janet, Myra and Sherry. From the Midtown terminal, the girls would head off each summer to the Berkshire mountains in Massachusetts. And they wanted nothing more than to be loose from their parents and to board the train, where they would sing for hours. "The parents had separation anxiety," remembered Ms. MacGregor, now 69. "But most of the kids were eager to get to camp and ignored our parents." Lindsey Green
felt a different kind of separation anxiety last November as she visited the main room of Grand Central three times in a three-week span. Ms. Green, a public relations and communications consultant, was evacuated from her apartment near Peck Slip in Lower Manhattan after superstorm Sandy. The lobby took in eight feet of water, forcing Ms. Green and her boyfriend to decamp to Brooklyn's Cobble Hill neighborhood. Frequent post-storm visits to Grand Central were her way of saying goodbye to the borough she'd called home for nearly a decade. "Grand Central has always been my zen place. It is the place that says New York to me," she said. Growing up in Florida, Ms. Green kept old photographs of Grand Central in notebooks, which ultimately inspired her to move to New York. On her first day in the city, she spent hours just watching people come and go from inside the old station's hallowed halls. "When I knew evacuation would mean leaving Manhattan for Brooklyn, the only place I felt the need to spend time in was Grand Central," she said. "It gives me clarity when things are incredibly out of sorts."

Buying 'Political Intelligence' Can Pay Off Big for Wall Street
By
Brody Mullins and Susan Pulliam Updated Jan. 18, 2013 12:46 a.m. ET
When Edward Kennedy Jr. launched Marwood Group more than a decade ago, he named it after the Maryland estate his grandfather, Joseph Kennedy, lived in when he was the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 1930s. Now, the SEC has issued subpoenas to Marwood, asking for emails and other documents that show how the political research firm was able to warn its Wall Street clients that regulators might delay...
