Mike Belk at a deep-cleaning operation in Orange Beach, Ala., where BP is scouring beaches that were coated with crude from the Gulf oil spill.
Associated Press An early effort to stop the leaking oil in the Deepwater Horizon disaster was doomed from the beginning because BP PLC and U.S. officials grossly underestimated how much was gushing from the blown-out well, according to a government report released Monday. The report suggested that if BP knew the well was leaking as much as 62,000 barrels of oil a day when it tried its "top kill" operation in May, about a month after the spill began, the procedure would have been scrapped. BP tried pumping drilling mud into the top of the well, believing the escaping oil was flowing at 5,000 barrels a day. Obama administration officials have insisted the initial low estimates had no effect on the response to the spill. But investigators for the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling concluded that the 5,000-barrel-a-day estimate "appears to have impeded" the top kill. "Because BP did not pump mud into the well at high enough rates to counter the actual flow, the hydrocarbons flowing from the well ejected the mud back up," commission investigators found. BP and government officials have never explained why the initial estimates were so low. The White House and BP declined to comment. A call to retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who was in charge of the oil-spill response, wasn't returned. An Energy Department spokesman said: "As we have said from the beginning, the response was always based on a worst-case scenario." The spill commission's report Monday found that the oil industry wasn't prepared to deal with the aftermath of the April 20 explosion that sank the Deepwater Horizon oil rig and killed 11 people. The commission also found that the government was "similarly unprepared to provide meaningful supervision" of the response. The commission's latest report portrays a turbulent relationship between government officials and BP managers. Conference calls involving administration officials and industry experts "were fairly disorganized with no preset agenda and people talking over one another," the investigators found. In the end, a crucial piece of analysis that convinced BP and the government that the flow of oil could be safely capped in mid-July was performed by a U.S. Geological Survey scientist working from a single cellphone camera photo of a plot of pressure readings from the well. Related Statoil Barely Averted North Sea Blowout Document: Report on BP oil spill Shelby Wants More BP Money for Alabama The report raises questions about the offshore drilling industry's capacity for handling a substantial offshore spill. BP, "one of the world's largest companies…still needed 87 days" to stop the gusher, commission investigators said. The government should require other oil companies "to demonstrate the capacity to respond to a disaster of this magnitude," whether through bonding or insurance requirements or by requiring companies that drill in deep water to belong to industry groups focused on well control, the commission staff said. The tougher rules could put pressure on smaller operators to set up large-scale spill response on their own. The finding could be helpful to the Obama administration, which faces pressure from the oil industry and some Gulf Coast lawmakers to relax what some industry executives say is a de facto moratorium on new offshore drilling permits. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and other administration officials met with industry representatives in Louisiana on Monday to discuss safety requirements the administration has imposed on drilling in the Gulf. Industry officials said they came away disappointed that the government offered no commitments to speed up the approval of drilling permits, as had been hoped after their champion, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D., La.), said she had won unspecified commitments in exchange for allowing the White House budget nominee to be confirmed. The spill commission investigators, in their latest report, shed new light on sometimes-tense interactions between the government and BP executives. After the failure of BP's top kill, Lars Herbst, the director of the Gulf of Mexico region for the Minerals Management Service, and Coast Guard Adm. Kevin Cook barged into a BP meeting to analyze the failed effort. Previously, government personnel hadn't insisted on joining these meetings, some of which took place behind closed doors. "Asserting the right to be present for BP's top kill analysis was a turning point for the government team," the report found. "The government significantly increased its oversight of the containment effort." Tensions escalated in July after BP installed a "capping stack" to seal the blowout preventer on the sea floor. By this time, responders were working with newer estimates that reflected a much higher spill rate, but some government officials worried that the stack would put too much pressure on the well, creating a new rupture. On July 15, a U.S. Geological Survey employee took a picture of the pressure readings with a cellphone camera and sent it to a co-worker, Paul Hsieh, in Menlo Park, Calif. Mr. Hsieh "apparently relied on the data in the single cellular-phone picture" to determine that there might not be a significant leak—backing BP's view, according to the report. "Unrealized at the time, a critical point had passed: BP would not have to reopen the stack, and oil had finally stopped leaking from the Macondo well," the report said.

MINNEAPOLIS—Players like Steve Novak are rare in today's NBA. Where most offensive-minded players will tell you they strived to emulate Michael Jordan's game, Novak openly admits to having idolized Ray Allen. Enlarge Image
Steve Novak will be in the three-point contest during the All-Star weekend.
Associated Press So because of that, and Novak's skill set as a pure shooter, it was understandable when the 29-year-old said it was "a dream come true" to be picked to participate in next weekend's three-point contest in Houston. But now that the dream is a reality, here's the bad news: It could throw off Novak's shooting stroke. Eight of the last 10 contest winners experienced a drop after the All-Star break in their three-point shooting percentage. More broadly, 20 of the past 30 players to participate in a three-point shootout the past five seasons saw a drop-off from long range after the All-Star Game. In this span, the three-point shooting percentage of the average three-point contest participant has fallen from 41.8% before the event to 37.8% in the season's second half. It's unclear as to why the players see a decline after the exhibition. Unlike a home-run derby, where a baseball player might alter the angle of his swing in hopes of putting on a display for fans, shooters don't alter their shot much from how it looks in the game. "A three-point shot is a three-point shot," said Novak, adding that the lone difference in the competition would be having to look down and away from the basket to pick the ball up off the rack. "[My shot] won't be any different when I come back." Knicks coach Mike Woodson also said he had no concerns about Novak's release possibly changing. "He should be right at home with those racks and the ball in his hands," he said. One possible theory for the decline would be that teams tighten their defenses late in the season while fighting to get into the playoffs, perhaps taking a toll on shooting numbers as a result. But that doesn't appear to be the case. The drop that contest participants experience is a stark contrast from how other players perform after the All-Star game on average. League-wide, three-point-shooting percentages have actually either held firm or increased following the break in each of the past five seasons, according to Stats LLC. Ten-time All-Star Jason Kidd has never taken part in a three-point contest, but after having sat courtside at several of the competitions, he said the thing that stands out the most is how the arena music affects shooters. "It speeds you up, because they're always playing this techno-type stuff, and it's kind of fast. So I think guys tend to shoot with the music, and they probably think they're running out of time," he said. Write to Chris Herring at chris.herring@wsj.com Email

By
Michael Siconolfi
Dec. 30, 2012 8:01 p.m. ET
A group of pension funds that oversee more than $3 trillion in assets asked U.S. securities regulators to revamp rules on how corporate executives can trade their company stock. In a letter Friday to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Council of Institutional Investors expressed concern that corporate insiders might be abusing their position by improperly profiting from trading their company shares while in possession of confidential information. The group cited a recent investigation by The Wall Street Journal,...

If there was one constant in Silicon Valley over the last decade, it was the near steady, profitable growth of Oracle Corp. No longer. Oracle remains a dominant force in technology with $32.7 billion in revenue and database and applications software used by corporations to manage their finances and procurement. Today, its business is being eroded at the edges by smaller, more focused companies offering newer technology. The...

broke with major European retailers on Tuesday by announcing its own plan for improving safety at Bangladesh garment factories. The plan is billed as a commitment, but is different from the legally-binding pact meant to prevent disasters like the building collapse that killed more than 1,100 garment workers last month. Under its plan, Wal-Mart said it would hire an outside auditor to inspect 279 Bangladesh factories and publish results on its website by June 1. When fire and building safety issues are found, Wal-Mart said it will require factory owners to make necessary renovations or risk being removed from its list of authorized factories.

Cos., whose Joe Fresh clothing was found in the building's rubble. Wal-Mart will pay for factory audits, which will be conducted by Bureau Veritas, a European inspection company. The retailer won't pay for renovations but will "expect the cost of safety improvements to be reflected in the cost of goods we buy," said Rajan Kamalanathan,
Wal-Mart's head of ethical sourcing, in an interview. "We don't want anyone to cut corners to put workers safety in jeopardy," he said. Nearly three weeks after a factory collapse killed more than 1,100 people, the world's biggest clothing companies are committing to safety standards that could play a key role in policing the country's main industry.

and a number of other North American brands have been drafting their own safety plan. Details of that plan are still evolving, said Jonathan Gold,
vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, a U.S. trade group. The proliferation of competing proposals may undermine their effectiveness, some experts said, and voluntary efforts have a poor track record. "Without the legally binding contract that the European retailers have signed, it's just putting lipstick on a pig," said Bob Ross, a critic of sweatshops who teaches sociology at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. Some U.S. retailers are uncomfortable with the accord because they could be liable in U.S. courts if they fail to adhere to the provisions, according to one person familiar with the matter. Enlarge Image
Army personnel Tuesday at the site of collapsed Rana Plaza building on the outskirts of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Xinhua/Zuma Press Gap had cited that legal liability issue as the reason it hasn't signed the accord. It has proposed an amendment to the pact that would replace the legally binding language with a provision that retailers that failed to live up to the standards be publicly expelled from the program. "We are six sentences away from signing the accord that's been proposed and remain cautiously optimistic that we will move down that path," a Gap spokesman said. Sears said it would continue "participating in discussions on the Accord as updates are made and more information is available, but is not prepared to sign the current proposal." Enlarge Image
The retail giant said it will make public a list of more than 250 factories whose authorization to produce goods for Wal-Mart has already been revoked.
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images The sponsors of the safety pact said they had met their goal of signing up enough retailers to cover 1,000 of the roughly 5,000 garment factories in Bangladesh and still expect more to sign on. Among the new signers on Tuesday were Italy's Benetton Group SpA, Spain's Mango MNG Holding SL and El Corte Ingles, France's Carrefour SA,

parent of the Zara fast-fashion chain, had announced on Monday they were signing the accord. Wal-Mart is among the biggest customers of Bangladeshi garment factories, which has grown into a $20 billion a year business. Wal-Mart said its safety plan meets or exceeds the proposal and "will get results more quickly," a spokesman said. The other plan endorsed by the European retailers "introduces requirements, including governance and dispute resolution mechanisms, on supply chain matters that are appropriately left to retailers, suppliers and government, and are unnecessary to achieve fire and safety goals," he said. Under the accord, a governing board will include three labor representatives, three retailer representatives and a chairman chosen by the U.N. International Labor Organization. The board will oversee safety inspections of up to 5,000 factories over two years, with the results to be made public. The board also will oversee dispute resolution between retailers and union representatives, which will be subject to arbitration with decisions enforceable in a court of law in the country of the retailer. To implement the accord, each company's cost will be based on how much they produce in Bangladesh. Participation will cost each company a maximum of $2.5 million over the five-year period, according to a draft of the agreement. Wal-Mart on Tuesday made public a list of more than 250 factories whose authorization to produce goods for Wal-Mart has already been revoked, though it isn't saying why they are no longer approved. "Audits aren't cheap and we pay for them ourselves," said Mr. Kamalanathan, in an interview. "By sharing fire safety and building inspections between the brands, retailers won't have to duplicate efforts." He said Wal-Mart wants to encourage retailers to work together by publishing audit results, so other clothing buyers are aware of Wal-Mart's concerns. Wal-Mart will also set up an independent call center for garment workers to report unsafe conditions and conduct fire safety training for every worker in the Bangladesh factories that make clothes for the U.S. retailing giant. James A. Gross,
professor of labor relations at Cornell University said using an outside auditor "frees the company of any independent supervision or assessment of what they are doing," he said.
