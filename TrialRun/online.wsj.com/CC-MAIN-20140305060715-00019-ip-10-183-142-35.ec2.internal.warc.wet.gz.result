IMF, S&P: Hungary Should Improve Quality Of Fiscal Steps

By Margit Feher BUDAPEST--Hungary needs to improve the quality of its fiscal consolidation measures to boost growth and reduce debt, the International Monetary Fund and rating agency Standard & Poor's said Tuesday. They acknowledged Hungary's commitment to keeping its budget shortfall below the European Union's tolerance level of 3% of gross domestic product. But removing policy uncertainty would boost investor confidence in the country, the IMF's resident representative said. "It's not a question how much [the budget deficit is] but how you achieve that," said Iryna Ivaschenko, IMF resident representative, in a panel at a financial conference in Budapest. "The [poor] quality of the policy is making it increasingly difficult for Hungary to reduce its debt level, which is a constraint on the [credit] rating," said Leila Butt, S&P's director for Hungary, in the same panel. Analysts have often criticized Hungary for its ad-hoc economic policy measures and for the unorthodox nature of its taxation and other fiscal steps. Hungary "must be a much more pro-business and especially pro-foreign business environment. There's huge competition for a much smaller cake of foreign direct investment, and, in Hungary, there are too many reasons to not to come here," said Standard Bank Economist Timothy Ash while speaking on the same panel. Hungary has mostly plugged its budget gaps with newer taxes levied mostly on the telecom, energy and bank sector, which are dominated by foreign companies. Investment, as a result, is in the doldrums, a negative for future growth. "Hungary must speed up the structural reform agenda. We are quite concerned about low growth, not just for now but for the medium to long term," she said. "This needs to be done with or without the IMF framework," Ms. Ivaschenko added. Hungary has been in talks with the IMF about a financial safety net for more than a year, with no result. While the talks haven't been closed officially, financial market and analysts consider them practically over. "Hungary doesn't need the IMF financing. The IMF loan would be the biggest anchor for business confidence," Standard Bank's Ash said. Write to Margit Feher at margit.feher@dowjones.com Email

North Sea Oil Platform Restarts After Six-Month Down Time

By Cassie Werber LONDON--The Cormorant Alpha oil platform in the North Sea has returned to full production after safety concerns prompted six months of repair work. "Cormorant Alpha recommenced production on 30 June and full production capability was achieved on 24 August following completion of a re-instatement project," according to platform operator TAQA Bratani in a statement posted on its website. No one from the company was available to confirm the details of the outage, or the restart, on Wednesday. The platform was shut down in early March when hydrocarbons were discovered to have leaked into one of the platform legs. The platform normally handles 10,000 barrels of oil a day, which it feeds into the Brent crude-oil pipeline system. Outages at Cormorant Alpha have several knock-on effects. Oil from 27 fields flows through the platform, and Total SA's (TOT) St. Fergus natural-gas terminal, north of Aberdeen, which delivers an average 21% of the gas used in the U.K. each day, sometimes can't operate due to the issues further up the production chain. The return to production is welcome news for TAQA Bratani's parent company, Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA.AD), which said in May that repairs at Cormorant Alpha were expected to weigh on its results during the second quarter, having contributed in part to an 80% on-year fall in first-quarter net profit. Cormorant Alpha was also shut down and partially evacuated in January following a leak in one of the legs. TAQA Bratani said on both occasions that no hydrocarbons had been released into the environment. Write to Cassie Werber at cassie.werber@wsj.com Email

The dining area in one of the Luciano Pavarotti apartments.
Bartomeu Amengual Nicoletta Mantovani, the second wife of the late Italian operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, has been getting a crash course in New York City real estate of late. Ms. Mantovani sold two apartments she purchased in New York as investments for less than she paid for them. And she also has hit bumps in attempting to sell one of the units that the famed tenor used to own. In September Ms. Mantovani put up for sale one of the three cooperative apartments that the storied opera singer used to own on the 23rd floor of the Hampshire House, at 150 Central Park South. But it's been slow going. Ms. Mantovani originally put the one-bedroom unit on the block for $1.75 million. That apartment is still for sale, though its price has been reduced to $1.15 million. 150 Central Park South
Bartomeu Amengual Ms. Mantovani also has put a second one-bedroom unit on the same floor on the block for the same price. She's keeping a third unit—also on the 23rd floor—this one a two-bedroom apartment. The building is known among some opera-buffs because the two surviving members of the so-called Three Tenors—Placido Domingo and José Carrera—also have lived there over the years, according to Sotheby's agent Robin Rothman, who is handling the sales for Ms. Mantovani. The offerings of the units come at a time that the city's residential market is continuing to show signs of stability despite economic uncertainty. The average sales price for co-ops rose to $930 a square foot in the first quarter of this year, up from $896 a square foot in the first quarter of 2011, according to a report by Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Ms. Rothman says the apartments Ms. Mantovani is selling need some renovation and don't have Central Park views, which are available in some other units in the building. Mr. Pavarotti had lived in the two=bedroom unit in Hampshire House when he was in the city. He used the other two apartments in the building for staff and guests. Ms. Rothman says that one of the late tenor's neighbors told her that "one of the great joys of living there" was opening her door to hear him sing through the hallway. Enlarge Image
Tenors Jose Carreras and Placido Domingo, right with Pavarotti, have also lived in the building.
Mick Hutson/Getty Images Ms. Mantovani also hasn't done that well on two apartments she bought by herself as investments in the summer of 2008. At that time, she bought a one-bedroom unit at 220 West End Ave. for $993,000 and a studio apartment at 88 Greenwich St. for $606,000, according to public records. Recently, she accepted $925,000 for the one-bedroom unit and $461,500, for the studio, according to records. Ms. Mantovani was advised to "proceed with the sale to avoid a further decline of the value," her spokesman said. Steven Kopstein, with SKNY Real Estate, was the broker on both sales. Ms. Mantovani inherited assets from Mr. Pavarotti in Europe and New York after he died in 2007. Currently, Ms. Mantovani is working to launch a new American branch of the Luciano Pavarotti Foundation, in memory of the singer. The foundation is making a fundraising push to establish a Pavarotti Garden in Central Park as well as scholarships for opera students, according to Mrs. Mantovani's spokesman.
