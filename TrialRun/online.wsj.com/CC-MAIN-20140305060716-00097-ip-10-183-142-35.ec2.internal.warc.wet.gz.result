FRANKFURT—Inflation is tumbling in key parts of the euro zone, including Germany and Spain this month, in a sign that consumer-price growth across the region is falling further below the European Central Bank's target, adding pressure on the central bank to keep inflation from falling dangerously low. Annual inflation in Germany fell in October to 1.3% from 1.6% the previous month based on common European Union definitions, Germany's...

(Best of the tube this weekend: Catch us tonight on "Lou Dobbs Tonight," 7 and 10 p.m. ET on Fox Business, and tomorrow on "The Journal Editorial Report," 2 and 11 p.m. ET on Fox News.) When 41-year-old Dan Quayle became the first baby boomer on a major-party presidential ticket in 1988, that generation's obsession, the Vietnam War, became a campaign issue in a new way. Democrats and sympathetic journalists sought to portray Quayle's service in the Indiana Army National Guard as a form of draft evasion. As we remember it, a major trope was that while serving in the Guard wasn't dishonorable, someone who aspired to the second-highest office in the land should be held to a "higher standard." That prompted us to write this satirical news story, which we posted on a computer bulletin board: QUAYLE A DEAD DUCK WASHINGTON, August 22 (AP)--Vice President George Bush is expected to announce today his decision to drop Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., from the number 2 spot on the Republican presidential ticket, in response to damaging revelations about Quayle's past. Bush has scheduled a press conference for this afternoon with Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kans., fueling speculation that Dole will replace the ill-fated Quayle on the ticket. The furor over Quayle began last week. Almost immediately after Bush announced his pick for the vice-presidential spot, it was revealed that Quayle joined the National Guard in 1969. This controversy, which dogged the Bush-Quayle ticket, was compounded Sunday when the Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Quayle got little better than a "C"-average as a college undergraduate. "He was an average student," one unidentified professor told the newspaper. "There's nothing wrong with that, but someone who wants to be vice president should be held to a higher standard." Today's newspapers were filled with even more potentially damaging allegations about Quayle: -- The Miami Herald quoted an unidentified former babysitter as saying that as a two-year-old, the senator-to-be was "an impossible child, who often cried and stayed up past his bedtime." She added, "I realize two is a difficult age, but someone who wants to be vice president should be held to a higher standard." -- The Albuquerque Journal reported that Quayle has an extensive police record. According to the Journal, Quayle has been cited for jaywalking and driving 63 mph in a 55 zone. "His wife was pregnant at the time, and he was driving her to the hospital," said the unidentified police officer who ticketed Quayle for speeding. "Under normal circumstances I wouldn't even have given him a ticket, but someone who wants to be vice president should be held to a higher standard." -- The New York Post quoted an unidentified law school classmate of the junior Indiana senator, who said that Quayle, as part of a bizarre Satanic ritual, killed 52 neighborhood pet cats, skinning them and leaving the entrails on their owners' lawns. Quayle admitted killing the cats, but sidestepped the issue of Satanic worship. "It was a learning experience," he told reporters. "In our complicated world, anyone who wishes to hold high office needs to know there's more than one way to skin a cat. I'm proud to say I know of at least seven." -- The Chicago Tribune, quoting an unidentified first-grade classmate of Quayle, said that the senator once mispronounced a word in the Pledge of Allegiance, calling the United States "one nation under guard" rather than "under God." The unidentified classmate said, "I know most kids get the words to the Pledge wrong. Heck, I'm 41 and I still don't know them. But someone who wants to be vice president should be held to a higher standard." One unidentified Bush aide said the decision to drop Quayle from the ticket was prompted by this revelation. "This is highly embarrassing because the vice president has made his opponent's opposition to the Pledge of Allegiance into a major campaign issue," said the unidentified aide. "Michael Dukakis may not care whether Lloyd Bentsen can say the Pledge, but we believe someone who wants to be vice president should be held to a higher standard." If we had been more ambitious, we might have ended up at the Onion instead of at The Wall Street Journal, where our job is easy because we only have to write stuff that's true. (Incidentally, we can't remember if that quote about Quayle's grades was from an actual news story, though we did find similar ones, and he was described as a C student.) Journalism today looks increasingly like satire in 1988. Mitt Romney, another baby boomer, is the presumptive Republican nominee for president, and the Washington Post has reached back to 1965, before Romney even graduated from high school, in search of scandal. Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs
Amazon.com Those of us who were born after 1965 have a hard time wrapping our minds around just how long ago that was. Here's some perspective: Lyndon B. Johnson was president, and Barack Obama was turning 4. Selma, Ala., was not a metaphor but the site of actual civil rights marches. Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs recorded "Wooly Bully" while "Get Smart" and "I Dream of Jeannie" premiered. NASA was at work on a futuristic plan to land men on the moon. Mary Jo Kopechne was still alive. Romney was a senior at a prep school called Cranbrook, and according to the Post, he and some other boys played a cruel prank on a classmate named John Lauber, "a soft-spoken new student one year behind Romney, [who] was perpetually teased for his nonconformity and presumed homosexuality." Lauber, according to the Post's account, "was walking around the all-boys school with bleached-blond hair that draped over one eye." Lauber died in 2004 and thus couldn't be reached for comment, but the Post interviewed no fewer than five other students, "who gave their accounts independently of one another" and remembered the incident "similarly." According to the Post's summary, they came upon Lauber, tackled him and pinned him to the ground. As Lauber, his eyes filling with tears, screamed for help, Romney repeatedly clipped his hair with a pair of scissors." The five "mostly lean Democratic"; one was a volunteer for Obama's 2008 campaign. Lauber's life seems to have been an unhappy one. He was subsequently expelled from school for smoking a cigarette. He "came out as gay" and "led a vagabond life." He was committed to a psychiatric hospital "after an extreme fit of temper in front of his mother and sister." He worked as an embalmer and a chef. Perhaps most tragically of all, "his hair thinned as he aged"--unlike Romney's. In response to the report, Romney acknowledged: "Back in high school, I did some dumb things, and if anybody was hurt by that or offended, obviously I apologize for that." He added that "I don't remember that incident." Should anyone care? Even the Post's own lefty blogger Greg Sargent is hard-pressed to answer in the affirmative. After going through a list of character flaws critics say this reveals about Romney--"a real mean streak, a disdain for the weak, and an ugly side to his sense of privilege . . . a homophobic streak"--Sargent throws up his hands: But when it comes down to it, this all happened too long ago and too early in Romney's life to know with real certainty whether it's revealing of any of those things or not--particularly when it comes to who Romney is right now. I can't get around the simple fact that I wouldn't want to be judged today by some of the things I did in my teens, and I suspect many others feel the same way. Unlike in 1988, but like in 2004 when CBS News ran a fraudulent hit piece about George W. Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard, other news outlets, mainstream and conservative, are questioning the story. ABC News quotes one of John Lauber's sisters: "The family of John Lauber is releasing a statement saying the portrayal of John is factually incorrect and we are aggrieved that he would be used to further a political agenda." Another ABC report notes that the paper seems to have erred in describing the recollection of Romney classmate Stu White: While the Post reports White as having "long been bothered" by the haircutting incident," he told ABC News he was not present for the prank . . . and was not aware of it until this year when he was contacted by the Washington Post. Breitbart.com reports that the Post changed the text to read that White "said he has been 'disturbed' by the Lauber incident since hearing about it several weeks ago, before being contacted by the Washington Post." Conservatives also counter that young Barack Obama was a bully, too. A blog called The Talk of the Times unearths an Obama middle-school tale from "Dreams From My Father." Classmates were teasing Obama and a girl named Coretta, suggesting they were boyfriend and girlfriend: "She's not my g-girlfriend," I stammered. I looked to Coretta for some assistance, but she just stood there looking down at the ground. "Coretta's got a boyfriend! Why don't you kiss her, mister boyfriend?" "I'm not her boyfriend!" I shouted. I ran up to Coretta and gave her a slight shove; she staggered back and looked up at me, but still said nothing. "Leave me alone!" I shouted again. And suddenly Coretta was running, faster and faster, until she disappeared from sight. Appreciative laughs rose around me. Then the bell rang, and the teachers appeared to round us back into class." But both Romney and Obama have nothing on Vice President Biden. Commentary's Alana Goodman quotes from Richard Ben Cramer's "What It Takes: The Way to the White House," a book on the 1988 presidential campaign (in which Biden briefly competed): Once Joey [Biden] set his mind, it was like he didn't think at all--he just did. That's why you didn't want to fight him. Most guys who got into a fight, they'd square off, there'd be a minute or so of circling around, while they jockeyed for position. Joey didn't do that. He decided to fight . . . BANGO—he'd punch the guy in the face. Joe was kind of skinny, and he stuttered, and the kids called him Bye-Bye, for the way he sounded when he tried to say his name. But Joey would never back down, and he knew how to box, when no one else did. . . . Even after he left, after Mr. Biden got the job selling cars in Wilmington and moved the family away, Charlie Roth would still (in moments of duress) tell guys that his friend Joey Biden would come back and beat them up, if they didn't watch out. (When Joe did come back, Charlie always had a list.) We suppose a Biden partisan could take this as a positive--proof that he's someone who'll fight for you! Likewise, maybe some Republicans are relieved to hear that Romney has a nasty side. A lot of them do think John McCain was too much of a pushover in 2008. But it seems unlikely the election will be decided by this sort of thing. After all, no one much cared about Quayle's National Guard service, which at least occurred after he was an adult; and Bill Clinton, with no military service at all, managed to beat two World War II veterans. If journalists are going to dig up ancient history, we hope they at least find something more interesting than this, though "Bam Bites Dog" set a high bar. Obama vs. Obama President Obama now says he's for same-sex marriage. But it turns out he is speaking with forked tongue when it comes to the process by which he would like that goal to be realized. Here's what he said in the famous interview with ABC's "Good Morning America": What you're seeing is, I think, states working through this issue--in fits and starts, all across the country. Different communities are arriving at different conclusions, at different times. And I think that's a healthy process and a healthy debate. And I continue to believe that this is an issue that is gonna be worked out at the local level, because historically, this has not been a federal issue, what's recognized as a marriage. But law professor Jonathan Adler, writing at Volokh.com, reports that the Justice Department's position is that states are obligated to permit same-sex marriage: According to Attorney General Eric Holder, he and the President concluded that the constitutionality of legal distinctions based upon sexual preference cannot be defended. In their view, because [the Defense of Marriage Act] precludes federal recognition of same-sex marriages, it violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment. Further, according to Holder's statement, they concluded that no "reasonable" constitutional argument could be made in DOMA's defense. Since equal protection also limits the states, the administration's legal position would lead to the conclusion "that a state's refusal to treat opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike is unconstitutional," Adler writes. Given that a majority of states have amended their constitutions by popular vote to affirm the traditional definition of marriage, you can see why this legal position is not one the president is eager to defend politically. His rhetoric hasn't "evolved" quite as much as his supporters are claiming. While he no longer pretends to oppose same-sex marriage, he still is pretending to favor its establishment by democratic means rather than judicial fiat. Matthew Gagnon, a former aide to Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, tells a tale of similar cynicism in an op-ed for the Bangor Daily News, concerning the December 2010 law that repealed the "don't ask, don't tell" ban on open gays in the military. The repeal was originally attached to a defense authorization bill: It quickly became obvious to us that [Majority Leader Harry] Reid and his allies in the White House were actively engaged in a coordinated attempt to torpedo the defense bill and blame Republican hyperpartisanship for its failure and for blocking repeal of don't ask, don't tell. The White House and Reid had decided that hammering home the "party of no" narrative and painting the Republicans as obstinate obstructionists was, to them, good politics. Since that wasn't actually happening, they tried to make it appear that it was. But Reid got outflanked. Collins, together with [Sen. Joe] Lieberman, unexpectedly introduced a standalone bill to repeal don't ask, don't tell, intended to go around Reid's roadblocks. After a great deal of lobbying to rally a number of other Republicans to support the bill--a necessary step to prevent a filibuster--the Collins bill eventually passed 65-31. "In the fawning coverage" of Obama's new positioning on same-sex marriage, Gagnon notes, "the repeal of don't ask, don't tell often has been cited as an accomplishment of his, which it was not. . . . Instead, a lone Republican senator from Maine was the one actually taking a phenomenal personal and political risk and ultimately proved to be the real engine behind the repeal." Out on a Limb "But in politics there are sometimes surprises, unanticipated changes, developments that seem obvious in retrospect but were wholly unexpected before they happened."--Michael Barone syndicated column, May 10 We Blame George W.

"And sometimes people forget the magnitude of it. You know, you saw some of that in the video that was shown. Sometimes I forget." Uh-oh, that was an unforced error, a gift to Mitt Romney. And making matters worse, in the same speech Obama offered this vision: "We've got to move forward, to the future that we imagined in 2008." We're going to move forward to an imaginary future from the past? Umm, OK. At least it's good to know he's reading our column. Meanwhile, Meghan Daum of the Los Angeles Times, reads some old love letters from Obama and concludes: The White House is holding Obama back. The gulf between the brilliant young man who wanted to change the world and the stymied president who can barely pass a piece of legislation, the cosmopolitan wearer of the sarong and the lock-step wearer of the flag pin, suggests he could have served the American people far more effectively if he weren't bogged down being the leader of the free world.
