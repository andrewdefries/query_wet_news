traders trounced investment bankers for most of the past decade. Now, the Wall Street firm's army of investment bankers is making a comeback. The 63-page internal report released by the New York company on Tuesday showed how Goldman is trying to reassert the traditional primacy of deal making while playing down the firm's recent reliance on trading. One of the biggest reasons why: Trading caused most of the turmoil, suspicion and reputational damage suffered by Goldman since the financial crisis erupted. Goldman officials say forthcoming changes detailed in the report aren't punishment for traders. But an overhaul in how the company discloses financial results, starting with fourth-quarter figures due Jan. 19, will wind up slicing how much what the firm defines as trading contributes to Goldman's overall revenue. In a securities filing Tuesday, Goldman detailed its plan to report trading revenue generated on behalf of clients separately from revenue that comes from trades and investments made by the firm. If the change had occurred in 2010's third quarter, Goldman would have reported net trading-related revenue of $4.67 billion, or 52% of the company's overall net revenue of $8.9 billion. The percentage is down from the 63% of total revenue Goldman originally said resulted from trading. Under another change, traders will suffer if the market for collateralized debt obligations and other complicated deals backed by mortgages or other loans rebounds. Goldman's Business Standards Committee yanked the power to underwrite such deals away from traders at the firm, handing it to the investment-banking unit. Enlarge Image
Goldman's Michael Evans had an influential role in shaping the changes.
Bloomberg News Even a ban on traders and brokers writing anything "expressing a view" about a deal Goldman underwrote for 30 days following the deal's execution is a reminder of the embarrassment and financial risk suffered by the company, partly because of emails written by traders. In one email, Fabrice Tourre,
a Goldman trader who helped create the Abacus 2007-AC1 deal that led to last year's fraud lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission, wrote shortly before the bonds were sold that the "whole building is about to collapse anytime now." Goldman executives insist trading isn't being given a backseat to investment banking despite the recent controversy or a downturn in trading profits. As part of a broader probe into the financial crisis last year, a Senate subcommittee investigated Goldman's packaging of mortgage-related investments and the firm's treatment of customers who bought them. The subcommittee is working on a report but hasn't set a date for release. A congressional blue-ribbon panel, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, also investigated Goldman, among a range of other topics. Its report is near completion and is expected to be released by the end of the month. "I've always felt the kind of man- or woman-in-the-street point of view that...the securities side was dominating the firm was an overstatement," E. Gerald Corrigan,
a Goldman managing director and co-chairman of the 17-person business-standards committee, said in an interview. While the company's growth prospects may be higher in investment banking than trading, much of the difference comes from the economic rebound, which could fuel more deal-making, he added. "Goldman is an economic animal," said Keith Horowitz,
an analyst at Citigroup Inc. "When they see opportunity, they are quickly able to redeploy capital in that direction." Goldman's powerhouse fixed-income trading business raked in at least half the company's total net revenues for six straight quarters, but then declined to 30% in the third quarter of 2010. In the same quarter, investment banking brought in 12% of companywide net revenue, representing a 24% jump from a year earlier. Read More Goldman Details Segment Changes Heard on the Street: Goldman Shows Some Ankle Trading revenue is being pressured partly by regulatory changes that limit how much Goldman can buy and sell for its own profit. Goldman recently wound down one of its proprietary equities-trading desks in response to the Dodd-Frank financial-reform law passed last year. In addition, Goldman and other securities firms are selling fewer mortgage bonds, corporate bonds and interest-rate derivatives to companies, according to analysts. The resurgence of investment banking includes work on some of the world's largest initial public offerings. Goldman was the lead underwriter of last year's stock-market debut by Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.

, which raised $22.1 billion. Goldman scored an even bigger coup with its unusual deal to help wealthy clients invest along with the firm in social-networking site Facebook Inc. Some outsiders and insiders say the investment bank's victories are likely to benefit Michael Evans,
the longtime Goldman banker who runs the firm's Asia business and was a co-chairman of the internal committee. Mr. Evans's influential role in the changes is fueling speculation he is being groomed for a more powerful job—and could eventually succeed Goldman Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd C. Blankfein.
Mr. Blankfein rose through Goldman's trading ranks. When asked about his future in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Mr. Evans said he will remain in his current position and oversee the implementation of the standards committee's changes. The report released Tuesday includes 39 changes that will be implemented during the next 15 to 18 months. James Angel,
an associate business professor at Georgetown University, said it is hard "to determine how much of this is a real shift, how much is a regulatory shift and how much is just optics." J.P. Morgan Chase

said they aren't planning to follow Goldman's lead by breaking out their proprietary trading revenues, people familiar with those firms said. "We are always reviewing our disclosure procedures to help provide better clarity in our financial results," Citigroup said in a statement. A person familiar with the thinking of Morgan Stanley executives said the firm intends to study what Goldman does differently when reporting fourth-quarter earnings next week. Morgan Stanley isn't expected to make any changes in its disclosures. In July, Goldman reached a $550 million settlement with the SEC. The eight-month introspection that resulted in Tuesday's report was announced by Mr. Blankfein at Goldman's annual meeting last May. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, Goldman shares slipped 40 cents, or 0.2%, to $169.36. —Aaron Lucchetti, Brett Philbin and Randall Smith contributed to this article.

A worker harvests bok choy at a California farm earlier this month.
Bloomberg News Key senators are exploring an immigration bill that would force every U.S. worker—citizen or not—to carry a high-tech identity card that could use fingerprints or other personal markers to prove a person's legal eligibility to work. Key senators are exploring an immigration bill that would force every U.S. worker-citizen or not-to carry a high-tech ID card that could use fingerprints or other personal markers to prove legal eligibility to work. Danny Yadron reports. Photo: Getty.
The idea, signaled only in vaguely worded language from senators crafting a bipartisan immigration bill, has privacy advocates and others concerned that the law would create a national identity card that, in time, could track Americans at airports, hospitals and through other facets of their lives. Vote
The lawmakers haven't committed to the "biometric" ID card, and are wary of any element that might split the fragile coalition of Democrats, Republicans and outside organizations working toward agreement on a broad overhaul of immigration laws. But at least five of the eight senators writing the bill have backed biometric ID cards in the past. At least three of them—Sens. Lindsey Graham
(R., S.C.), John McCain
(R., Ariz.) and Charles Schumer
(D., N.Y.)—have said they support requiring the cards under the new law but are open to other options, aides say. The goal is to ensure that employers can learn the legal status of all new hires quickly, part of the effort to dissuade illegal immigrants from entering the country or seeking jobs. A system now in place, called E-Verify, matches prospective hires to a database of Social Security numbers and other data, but it can be foiled at times when illegal immigrants give stolen names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers. The Senate group, in a statement guiding their work on a new law, called for workers to prove their legal status and identities through "non-forgeable electronic means." Senate aides said the language was intentionally broad because of the sensitivity of the issue. It leaves open several possibilities for how new hires would be required to prove they can legally work. Mr. Graham, in an interview, said that in his mind the language refers to a requirement for biometric ID cards. "This is the public's way of contributing to solving the problem" of illegal immigration, Mr. Graham said. A second senator working on the bill, Jeff Flake
(R., Ariz.), said in an interview he is open to the idea of biometric ID cards but that the issue remained unsettled. "You've got to give employers the tools" to screen new workers, Mr. Flake said, noting he had signed on to legislation in past years that employed biometric data. Mr. McCain's spokesman declined to discuss Senate talks on the current bill. Two other senators who have backed the ID card in the past, Mr. Schumer and Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois, said through spokesmen that the new Senate legislation wouldn't necessarily call for a biometric card. In 2010, Messrs. Graham and Schumer offered an immigration plan that included the requirement for an ID card featuring either fingerprints or a scan of the veins in the top of a person's hand. Like the senators, President Barack Obama
is calling for an improved worker-verification system, but he doesn't specifically call for a biometric card for all workers. In principles for an immigration overhaul released this year, Mr. Obama called for a "fraud-resistant, tamper-resistant Social Security card." Draft legislation prepared by the White House refers to collecting biometric information from those in the country illegally as part of qualifying for legal status. A senior administration official said the White House wants to deal with "fraud in a way that works and is cost effective." The other senators writing the immigration bill are Marco Rubio
(R., Fla.), Michael Bennet
(D., Colo.) and Robert Menendez (D., N.J.). Spokesmen for Messrs. Rubio and Bennet declined to comment on the ID cards, while a spokeswoman for Mr. Menendez said the lawmaker has supported employee verification with antifraud measures. As an alternative to a biometric card, senators may move to strengthen the E-Verify system by, for example, requiring new hires to answer questions about previous addresses or other details, a person familiar with the Senate group's thinking said. Aides to several senators in the group said that a biometric card would be used only for employment verification and that it wouldn't become a mechanism for linking other personal data or replacing drivers' licenses. Still, privacy advocates fear that governments and companies would in time require people to use the biometric card in other spheres of daily life. "I subscribe to the 'if you build it, they will come' school of regulation," said Chris Calabrese
of the American Civil Liberties Union, who said he worried that the card would be required to board airplanes, to vote or perhaps purchase a firearm. "It becomes in essence a permission slip to do all of the ordinary things that are your rights as an American," he said. Alex Nowrasteh,
an immigration-policy expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said: "It's not only a gross violation of individual privacy, it's an enormously high-cost policy that will have an incredibly low to negligible benefit." "Every time I've heard someone say 'non-forgeable,' it's code for biometric," Mr. Nowrasteh added. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports expanding the E-Verify system, which is now used by a fraction of companies, though some states require all businesses to use it to clear new hires. The chamber hasn't taken a position on biometric IDs, a spokeswoman said. Some businesses support a move to biometric cards. If Congress expanded E-Verify nationally, it could widen identity theft and create new paperwork for small businesses, some businesses said. A 2009 study by Westat Inc. for the Department of Homeland Security found that 54% of unauthorized workers who submitted E-Verify paperwork were able to trick the system, though unauthorized workers account for only 6.2% of E-Verify queries. A high-tech ID card that could be scanned could solve that problem, said Manuel Cunha Jr.
, president of the Nisei Farmers League in Fresno, Calif. The scan would check the employee against a federal database to confirm eligibility to work. "I don't want on the biometric card when I went to the hospital or whether I am married," Mr. Cunha said. "I just want to know Manuel F. Cunha Jr. can work." Julie Pace, an immigration lawyer from Phoenix, said she previously opposed a biometric card but would now support it as part of a broader immigration overhaul, arguing it would make worker verification more accurate. "Undocumented workers today would be so happy to come out from the underground," she said. It isn't clear how much such a card would cost businesses and taxpayers. When Mr. Schumer proposed biometric identification in 2010, he estimated card scanners could cost businesses as much as $800. A 2012 study by the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Law and Social Policy at the University of California, Berkeley, law school concluded that a national ID system would cost the government $22.6 billion to create and $2.1 billion each year to operate. Most European countries require their citizens to carry some form of ID. The U.K. recently attempted to offer voluntary national ID cards. Citing concerns over cost and civil liberties, it scrapped the plan in 2010. —Janet Hook contributed to this article. Write to Danny Yadron

LIVELY GROVE, Ill.—Coal has been losing favor as an energy source for a few years, thanks to relatively cheap and clean-burning natural gas and stricter environmental rules. But at least in this part of the country, mining is a booming business. One coal mine in this farming community southeast of St. Louis is part of an energy project that has added 580 jobs and helped fund a high school and court building. In McLeansboro, 70 miles to the east, a mine under construction has brought jobs and several new businesses. A...
