Brasil volta a ganhar peso para montadoras estrangeiras

Por NICO SCHMIDT
Além da China, esse verdadeiro "Eldorado", outro mercado está se tornando cada vez mais importante para a indústria automobilística: o Brasil. É verdade que as vendas das importadoras caíram muito no início do ano, depois que a economia do país perdeu a força dos anos anteriores e o governo aumentou as tarifas para importação de carros. Mas, depois disso, a situação se recuperou e a política dos fabricantes estrangeiros também se ajustou.
Especialistas acreditam que o mercado brasileiro ainda tem muito espaço para se expandir, apesar das altas taxas de crescimento dos últimos anos. É um "potencial considerável", nas palavras do principal lobista da indústria automobilística da Alemanha, Matthias Wissmann. O presidente da VDA, a Associação da Indústria Automobilística Alemã, disse que até agora apenas 14% dos brasileiros têm carro próprio. Em comparação, nos países desenvolvidos a proporção é superior a 75%.
De acordo com a opinião de especialistas, o mercado de automóveis no Brasil terá uma recuperação significativa no médio prazo. Especialistas da PricewaterhouseCoopers esperam até 2017 um crescimento anual médio de cerca de 6%; a firma de consultoria Roland Berger Strategy Consultants, sediada em Munique, na Alemanha, calcula que o crescimento pode chegar a 10%.
Entre 4,9 e 5,8 milhões de veículos foram vendidos em cinco anos no maior país da América Latina. Até 2020, o mercado pode chegar a 6,6 milhões de veículos, o dobro de 2010, pelas estimativas da Roland Berger. Mas já em 2015 o Brasil pode tomar do Japão o título de terceiro maior mercado consumidor do mundo.
A Roland Berger, assim como outros observadores, menciona três fatores que favorecem o forte crescimento: primeiro, a economia brasileira está se recuperando lentamente de uma desaceleração significativa causada pela crise na Europa. Segundo, a Copa do Mundo de 2014 e a Olimpíada de 2016 vão trazer não só maiores investimentos em infraestrutura, mas também reativar a economia. Em terceiro lugar, a classe média brasileira está crescendo muito, aumentando assim o número de pessoas que podem comprar um carro.
A PricewaterhouseCoopers estima que o crescimento da renda familiar dos brasileiros nos próximos anos será muito superior ao crescimento da economia do país, o qual ela estima em pouco mais de 4% ao ano, apesar das previsões de crescimento pífio da economia em 2012.
O bom desempenho da economia na sequência da crise financeira ainda causa boa impressão entre possíveis investidores estrangeiros. E, mais especificamente para o setor de automóveis, o crescimento ocorrido enquanto o mundo desenvolvido enfraquecia fez do Brasil uma praça promissora.
Pelos cálculos da Roland Berger, o mercado brasileiro para automóveis cresceu, em média, 16% entre 2006 e 2010. Em 2011, pela primeira vez, o Brasil foi o quarto maior mercado automotivo mundial, depois de China, Estados Unidos e Japão, apesar da estagnação do desenvolvimento.
No início do ano, a situação se deteriorou pela primeira vez. As causas são várias. O Brasil finalmente já não conseguiu resistir à crise da dívida europeia. Devido ao aumento da inadimplência, os bancos ficaram mais rigorosos na concessão de empréstimos. Como três de cada quatro carros novos no Brasil são financiados com empréstimos, as vendas caíram abruptamente.
Mas o maior problema foi doméstico. No final de 2011, Brasília aumentou drasticamente as tarifas sobre veículos importados. Resultado: o valor dos carros importados quase triplicou da noite para o dia. As vendas despencaram. A BMW, por exemplo, vendeu no Brasil nos primeiros nove meses do ano menos que a metade de um ano antes. Segundo dados da VDA, as exportações de automóveis alemães para o Brasil caíram mais em um terço até agora em 2012.
Em resposta, a BMW e a fabricante britânica Land Rover suspenderam planos de instalar montadoras no país.
Com ajuda estatal, o mercado automotivo brasileiro se reativou. No total, as vendas do ano cresceram. A VDA informou um aumento de quase 5,5% nas vendas de automóveis e veículos comerciais leves, nos últimos nove meses. Uma razão foi a redução, no segundo trimestre, dos impostos sobre os veículos comerciais e sobre o crédito ao consumidor, a fim de estimular as vendas.
O governo também vem ajudando os importadores em dificuldades. A nova lei concede benefícios fiscais aos fabricantes que montam carros no Brasil. Com os investimentos, as empresas estrangeiras podem compensar, parcialmente, as desvantagens que enfrentam. Um porta-voz da BMW saudou as novas condições.
A montadora este mês anunciou sua decisão de construir uma nova fábrica em Santa Catariana, ao custo de 200 milhões de euros, como parte de sua estratégia mundial de aumentar a produção em mercados emergentes aproveitando a demanda nessas regiões.
"O Brasil é um mercado com tremendo potencial", disse o diretor de vendas da BMW, Ian Robertson, num comunidado quando a fábrica foi anunciada.
O fato de que fabricantes de carros de luxo como a BMW também estão pensando em produzir localmente no Brasil é consequência lógica das oportunidades de crescimento no segmento mais caro. A Roland Berger estima que em 2017 serão vendidos entre 180.000 e 190.000 carros de luxo no Brasil. No período de 2008/2009 as vendas ficaram em um quarto desse volume.
Tal como na China, o carro no Brasil é um símbolo da ascensão social. E, como a classe mais próspera deve crescer a um ritmo rápido, o mercado dos veículos mais caros também poderá atingir massa crítica, com as fábricas de veículos de luxo operando em plena capacidade.
Em suma, o sinal está verde para a indústria automotiva no Brasil. A agência de classificação de crédito Standard & Poor's prevê que o país continuará sendo um motor de crescimento. Dada a fraqueza do mercado europeu, isso também é importante, especialmente considerando o rápido crescimento da China nos anos anteriores. Uma nova ilha de crescimento, o Brasil, surge em um bom momento para a indústria automotiva.
Mas o crescimento não vem sem custos. Os motoristas brasileiros estão mais exigentes. Os fabricantes devem oferecer tecnologias que até agora se limitaram aos países desenvolvidos. A Volkswagen, líder da indústria europeia e presente no Brasil há décadas, afirmou recentemente que as necessidades dos brasileiros vêm nitidamente mudando. Além de linhas modernas, um aspecto muito importante para o comprador é a segurança, representada, por exemplo, por um sistema antitravamento nos freios.
No médio prazo, as consultorias e também a S&P preveem que os fabricantes no Brasil podem enfrentar um excesso de capacidade.
A PricewaterhouseCoopers estima que a indústria automotiva nos próximos anos planeja investir US$ 25 bilhões para expandir suas fábricas brasileiras. Segundo o estudo da Roland Berger, a capacidade de produção pode aumentar de 3,6 milhões de automóveis em 2010 para 5,5 milhões em 2020. Os consultores concluem que, se as previsões mais otimistas não se concretizarem, é possível haver excesso de capacidade e uma disputa entre os fabricantes por participação no mercado, prejudicando a lucratividade.
A concorrência no Brasil já está se intensificando. As três empresas dominantes — Volks, Fiat e General Motors — perderam mercado recentemente, segundo a PricewaterhouseCoopers, principalmente por causa das sul-coreanas Hyundai e Kia. Além disso, as montadoras chinesas também descobriram o mercado brasileiro.
Apesar de todas as oportunidades abertas às empresas nos países emergentes, não se podem ignorar os riscos nos mercados em rápido crescimento como Brasil, Rússia, Índia e China. Não é raro haver fortes oscilações na economia, ou decisões políticas que modifiquem abruptamente as condições do mercado.
A política fiscal do Brasil prejudica as fábricas alemãs, "especialmente o acesso ao mercado", reclamou Wissmann, o lobista da indústria automotiva alemã, referindo-se ao aumento nas tarifas de importação. "Essa barreira comercial, infelizmente, é mais um exemplo do crescente protecionismo que observamos há algum tempo em alguns mercados emergentes."
No entanto, os fabricantes de automóveis já não podem mais ignorar os países do Bric, uma vez que o mercado de muitos países ocidentais industrializados está saturado. O exemplo da PSA Peugeot-Citroën mostra o que acontece quando se evita o risco empresarial de entrar em um novo mercado. Fechada em um mercado europeu em queda acentuada, a montadora francesa teme até pela sua própria sobrevivência, enquanto concorrentes globais como a Volkswagen comemoram recordes de vendas, apesar de todas as dificuldades econômicas nos mercados maduros.

U.S. House Speaker John Boehner speaks to the press after a House Republican meeting on Capitol Hill on Thursday.
REUTERS Congress's rocky path to avoiding a government shutdown became even rougher Thursday, as Speaker John Boehner
said the House wouldn't accept the spending plan likely to emerge from the Senate. The Ohio Republican's announcement foreshadows a set of last-minute legislative volleys between the House and Senate to fund federal agencies ahead of a deadline Monday, the final day of the fiscal year. House Speaker John Boehner says the American people don't want Obamacare, and that the Senate needs to include Republican provisions in any bill that would keep the government from shutting down when the new fiscal year starts on Oct. 1 Photo: AP

The Senate is expected to pass a bill Friday that would fund the government for the first 1½ months of the new fiscal year. But Senate Democrats plan to restore money for the Affordable Care Act that House Republicans had stripped out, leaving the two chambers in conflict. While the House and Senate struggled for agreement on a government-funding plan, Mr. Boehner was wrestling with the more daunting task of persuading members of his own party to support an increase in the federal debt ceiling. Some of the most conservative House members were wary of the Republican leadership's plan to pass a one-year extension of government borrowing authority, even though it would be linked to a yearlong delay of the health law and other prized GOP policy goals. They expressed concern that the bill wouldn't cut spending enough and questioned the strategy of moving forward in the midst of a separate budget fight. President Barack Obama
repeated Thursday that he won't negotiate on the debt ceiling and won't sign any bill that defunds or delays the health-care law. He lashed out at Republicans for what he said were moves endangering the full faith and credit of the country. "You don't mess with that," he said in a speech in Largo, Md. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that if the debt ceiling isn't raised, the government will be unable to pay all its obligations sometime in late October. Investors appear to be eyeing the possibility that the issue won't be resolved, judging by the sixfold increase in the past week—to its highest level since 2011—of the annual cost of derivatives some investors use to hedge against the risk the U.S. will default on its debt. Rep. Tom Cole
(R., Okla.), said House GOP leaders were still working to line up support for their debt-ceiling plan. "We've got an awful lot of support, but clearly at this point we don't have a final product that's attracting the number that we need," said Mr. Cole. The fractiousness, jockeying and brinkmanship that spread across the Capitol rattled lawmakers and upended predictions about when and how the House and Senate would avoid two impending fiscal calamities. Tensions were high on the Senate floor as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) exploded in anger when he was blocked from holding the vote Thursday by an objection from Sen. Mike Lee
(R., Utah), a leading opponent of the health-care law. The Republicans' delaying tactics were "as obvious to me as it is to a kindergarten student," Mr. Reid said. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), accused Mr. Lee and Sen. Ted Cruz
(R., Texas) of grandstanding in refusing to allow quicker action on the bill. "The reason that we're putting this off is because they would like for people around the country that they have notified to be able to watch,'' said Mr. Corker, in an unusually personal public squabble with a fellow Republican. Mr. Lee said the debate was too important to cut short. "The American people are paying attention to this," he said. House lawmakers are prepared to be in session this weekend to take up the bill once it returns from the Senate. Talk that they might accept the Senate bill, which is sure to include money for the health law, and send it to President Obama for his signature dissipated on Thursday when Mr. Boehner said flatly, "I do not see that happening." Even so, Mr. Boehner said he didn't expect a government shutdown. Many GOP officials are anxious to avoid one, because they fear their party would bear the blame. Republicans were widely seen as responsible for the shutdowns in 1995-1996 that arose from budget fights between Congress and then-President Bill Clinton.
Rep. Mo Brooks
(R., Ala.) accused Democrats of gunning for a shutdown for political gain. "They crave a government shutdown, because they believe it would give them a campaign advantage in 2014," he said. House Republicans are considering a range of options for amending the Senate bill to make it more palatable to conservatives, which would force the Senate to consider the bill again before the Monday midnight deadline. Adding a one-year delay in the health-care law's individual mandate is an option that House GOP lawmakers are considering, as is a repeal of the law's tax on medical devices, senior Republican aides said. House Republican leaders have been telling conservatives that efforts to limit the reach of the health-care law would be a central element of the battle over raising the debt limit. The draft debt-limit bill being circulated included a range of GOP policy proposals. In addition to delaying the health-care law, it included instructions for overhauling the tax code, blocking environmental regulations and clearing the way for building the Keystone XL pipeline. National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden
(R., Ore.) said the policies are intended to stimulate the economy, which in turn would reduce the deficit. He said they also were designed to broaden the GOP message beyond its traditional antispending, small-government focus. "It's not just about cutting spending; it's not just about cutting government," he said. "We have to grow the economy. Our message hasn't resonated as positively as we would want." Democrats derided the legislation as a political gesture. "The House is attaching the Republican Party platform to the debt ceiling," said Sen. Charles Schumer
(D., N.Y.). Even with its broad reach, the draft bill didn't include any major deficit-reduction initiatives, such as structural reforms to Medicare and Medicaid. Conservative critics said it represented a retreat from Mr. Boehner's past promises to support increases in the debt limit only if they are matched by spending cuts of equal value, with the goal of balancing the budget in 10 years. "I don't know if this gets us down that road," said Rep. Mick Mulvaney
(R., S.C.). "Are we still dollar-for-dollar in terms of reduction of the deficit?" —Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article. Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@dowjones.com and Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com Email

Marc Siegel: The Death of the Bedside Manner
ObamaCare is speeding the decline in the quality of medical practice. By
Marc Siegel
Dec. 26, 2013 7:17 p.m. ET
'It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born," James Joyce wrote famously in his masterpiece "Ulysses." I recently had such an experience when my office manager—who protects me from the daily insurance grind of referrals and approvals and pre-certifications and blood drawing—was out sick. Thus the veil was lifted from my eyes, and I awoke to the harsh realities of our medical future. One patient was severely depressed and needed medication and a referral to a psychiatrist. Another was...

Brightest Stall, Low Achievers Gain
Some Say Top Students Need Attention Given to Weaker Performers, as Smart Kids' Scores Barely Move
By
Stephanie Banchero
November 12, 2011
A national focus on the lowest-achieving students has helped boost their academic performance, but it has left the country's brightest young minds behind, prompting calls to rethink how schools teach top kids. Recent data, including results released last week from national math and reading exams, show high achievers are stagnating and falling behind their international counterparts. A report by the National Association for...

ST. LOUIS—Worries over immigrants potentially taking jobs from native-born Americans run high in parts of the nation, but some U.S. cities are taking a different view: Wooing immigrants can reverse long-term declines in population. Cities, mostly in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic states, are betting that attracting foreign-born residents can spur business creation and revive neighborhoods.

WASHINGTON—Federal health regulators moved to tighten oversight of tanning beds and said people younger than age 18 shouldn't use the beds at all.
