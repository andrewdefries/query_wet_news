Updated May 25, 2012 10:35 p.m. ET
The aerospace industry reached a milestone Friday, when Space Exploration Technologies Corp. became the first private company to dock a spacecraft with the International Space Station, some 240 miles above Earth. Astronauts have captured SpaceX's Dragon capsule ahead of an historic docking expected Friday, making it the first commercial vessel to visit the international space station. Andy Pasztor reports on Lunch Break. Photo: AP.
After two days of complex maneuvering, the capsule's propulsion systems and sensors were validated and the spacecraft slowly inched toward the orbiting station until it was close enough to be snared by a robotic arm. The test flight culminates years of planning to demonstrate Space Exploration's ability to reliably launch cargo missions to supply the orbiting laboratory, a venture supported by a group of 16 nations. The brainchild of 40-year-old Elon Musk—former Internet whiz kid and co-founder of PayPal Inc.—SpaceX, as it's known, is under a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to begin shuttling cargo to the space station. SpaceX founder Elon Musk discusses his goal of putting a man on Mars within 10 years, in an excerpt from a Big Interview with WSJ's Alan Murray. (Originally published April 2011)
The launch and haltingly slow maneuvers of the unmanned Dragon capsule, as it berthed with the space station, underscored the discipline, resilience and technical prowess of Mr. Musk's 10-year-old privately held company. The accomplishment also helped buttress plans by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to pay private companies to transport cargo and crew to the orbiting station. SpaceX Prepares to Dock

An image captured by NASA-TV from the international space station showed the SpaceX Dragon commercial cargo craft as it flew over the coast of West Africa early Friday.
Reuters Space-Chase Billionaires Sir Richard Branson gave the thumbs up in front of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo on Dec. 7, 2009.
Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images "There is so much that could have gone wrong, and it went right," Mr. Musk told reporters hours after the docking. "I'm hopeful that a lot of people's doubts have been put to rest." Still, the Southern California company faces huge challenges to turn Friday's feat into a thriving, long-term business—one that could help birth an industry of privately funded space ventures. The major question is whether Mr. Musk and his management team can transform SpaceX from a boutique development outfit into a low-cost, relatively high-volume production house, say aerospace industry officials and space experts. "Will they be able to reliably repeat this, and do it at the price they promised?" asked Scott Pace, a former senior NASA official who now teaches at and runs George Washington University's Space Policy Institute.

SpaceX, which plans to launch NASA missions from the government's Cape Canaveral space complex in Florida, intends to set up a private launch facility of its own, most likely along the Gulf Coast. Its order book includes more than $1 billion of future satellite launches for commercial operators, foreign governments and research outfits. And the Air Force recently moved to make it easier for SpaceX to compete for launches of big military and spy satellites. The company is one of several pursuing NASA funding to develop private manned spacecraft designed to transport astronauts into orbit during the second half of this decade. Competitors include closely held XCOR Aerospace, Sierra Nevada Corp. and a start-up run by Jeff Bezos,

took a stake. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla went public in June 2010. Enlarge Image
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, shown last year, hopes it put 'doubts to rest.' Bloomberg News Mr. Musk used $100 million of his personal fortune to start SpaceX in 2002 but within six years the fledgling enterprise was tottering. The company's first three rocket launches, which Mr. Musk had promoted as less expensive than the competition, all failed in very public ways. At the same time, the government had relegated him to operating from an isolated U.S. missile-test range in the Pacific. Using Kwajalein atoll as a base hugely increased SpaceX's logistics costs and complicated every aspect of launch preparations. By the fall 2008, Mr. Musk was reeling under additional pressure because his marriage had fallen apart, and he was facing a potentially drawn-out and acrimonious divorce. Tesla Motors, in which Mr. Musk had a controlling stake, was buffeted by financial problems and sucking up more of his time. By that time, SpaceX was hemorrhaging money and its distraught founder felt increasingly hemmed in. "It was pretty tough slogging" from 2007 to 2009, Mr. Musk recalled in a 2010 interview, calling the period "the worst two years of my life." Chastened by the hostility and sometimes ridicule of many industry and government officials, Mr. Musk later acknowledged he contemplated abandoning the company. Meanwhile, the day-to-day difficulties of soothing skeptical customers and creating a space company from scratch didn't abate. In the 2010 interview, he referred to living through some "heart-wrenching episodes." The fog began to lift in September 2008, when SpaceX's Falcon1 rocket successfully placed a dummy payload into orbit and Mr. Musk was able to snare additional customers. Revenue from SpaceX's work for NASA also began to pick up. As part of Mr. Musk's strategy, SpaceX moved into uncharted territory by breaking from the industry's traditional reliance on hiring subcontractors to design and manufacture key systems such as engines. Instead, SpaceX has recruited its own cadre of engineers—some lured away from larger rivals—and concentrated on doing most of the work internally. Friday's tie-up with the space station, which some of the company's champions weren't sure would be achieved on the first try, shifts the spotlight to SpaceX's next moves. With the success behind it, SpaceX still needs to demonstrate the long-term strength of its business model, according to Howard McCurdy,
a space policy expert and professor of public affairs at American University in Washington, D.C. NASA will realize anticipated cost savings, according to Mr. McCurdy, only "if there is a broader commercial market and SpaceX can spread its production costs" across all those orders. "If it's producing one [rocket] a year, the model simply won't work," according to Mr. McCurdy. Mr. Musk also sees the importance of robust production and frequent launches, at least one a month. It's vital for SpaceX's future "to be in a steady cadence of launches," he told reporters Friday. He joked that initially "we had a tiny little factory" near a suburban strip mall, where space was so scarce that all the stages of a single rocket couldn't fit into the same building. Now, taking advantage of a sprawling, renovated factory that used to assemble fuselage sections for Boeing

747 jumbo jets, SpaceX must manufacture and test enough hardware to send 12 cargo missions to the space station over the next few years. The company also has to supply rockets to over a dozen other customers that have hired SpaceX to do satellite launches. Key will be hiring the right people. Mr. Musk spelled out his view of the optimum workforce on Friday. Noting that the average age of today's SpaceX employees is 30, he told reporters his management goal is melding "the wisdom of age with the vibrancy of youth." NASA and SpaceX have predicted that relying on private cargo vehicles and space taxis to carry crews will be less expensive than having the space agency use traditional procurement methods to purchase next-generation rockets and spacecraft. If that holds true, it could deflect congressional criticism directed against SpaceX and other commercial ventures seeking NASA business. Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com Email

WASHINGTON—Iran's infiltration of a Navy computer network was far more extensive than previously thought, according to officials, and the officer who led the response will likely face questions about it from senators weighing his nomination as the next head of the embattled National Security Agency. It took the Navy about four months to finally purge the hackers from its biggest unclassified computer network, according to current...

The Obama administration's decision to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other 9/11 conspirators in federal court marks a fundamental shift in the way we fight terrorism. For eight years we have allowed the terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our laws and institutions. This decision shows that we're strong enough to face the threat of terrorism without compromising the rule of law. The premeditated murder of innocent civilians far from any battlefield is not the act of a warrior, but of a criminal. The prior administration detained these men indefinitely as "enemy combatants." But the laws of war allow only temporary detention of combatants until the end of the armed conflict in which they were captured. They were never intended to authorize the detention of people for terrorist activities far from the battlefield. Moreover, calling these people combatants elevates them to a status they do not deserve. Judge William Young got it right in rejecting the claims of Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber: "You are not an enemy combatant. . . . You are not a soldier in any war. To call you a soldier gives you far too much stature . . . . You're no warrior. You are a terrorist, a species of criminal guilty of multiple attempted murders. . . . You're no big deal." Anyone who suggests that our criminal justice system will coddle these terrorists is simply not familiar with the record. In a detailed study prepared in 2006 under the Bush administration, the Justice Department reported "impressive success" in convicting terrorists. Between September 2001 and June 2006, it obtained convictions against more than 250 people for terrorism-related offenses, covering a range of activities, from completed acts of terrorism to the "early stages of terrorist planning." A white paper published in May 2008 by Richard Zabel and James Benjamin, former federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, where KSM and his cohorts will be tried, examined nearly 125 federal terrorism prosecutions involving Islamic extremist groups. They concluded that the existing "criminal justice system serves as an effective means of convicting and incapacitating terrorists." Significantly, the conviction rate has been more than 90% for terrorist defendants generally and 100% in cases with domestic targets. No coddling evident there. Opponents say our security will be compromised because much of the evidence against these men is classified. But as the Supreme Court emphasized in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004) and Boumediene v. Bush (2008), detainees must be given the opportunity to confront the evidence against them. The federal courts have by far the most experience applying the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), which balances a defendant's right to be informed with the government's need to protect classified information from disclosure. The courts have developed numerous procedures for accomplishing those goals, including the use of pseudonyms, paraphrasing, summaries and the like, all employed under the close supervision of the presiding judge. Those procedures work. As the former prosecutors from New York concluded: "We are not aware of a single terrorism case in which CIPA procedures have failed and a serious security breach has occurred." Military tribunals may be appropriate when the perpetrators are combatants or the targets are military, as with the 2000 attack on the USS Cole. But they have a lower conviction rate and do not have the same international credibility as trials in the federal courts. Moreover, federal judges have extensive experience dealing with these cases, with attempts to disrupt the process, and with keeping the focus on the key issue of guilt or innocence, rather than on the legitimacy of the forum being used. Finally, some have expressed concerns that trial in New York will expose its citizens to further terrorist attacks. One must sympathize with those concerns. But New York has been the site of the most important terrorism trials in the past, and it has met the challenge. We must have the courage to bring these heinous criminals to justice where they have done their harm. As Judge Young said in imposing sentence on the shoe bomber: "We are not afraid of any of your terrorist co-conspirators, Mr. Reid. We are Americans. We have been through the fire before . . . . [W]e do not negotiate with terrorists. We do not treat with terrorists. We do not sign documents with terrorists. We hunt them down one by one and bring them to justice." Mr. Wilner was counsel of record to Guantanamo detainees in the Supreme Court's June 2004 and June 2008 rulings in their favor on habeas corpus rights. Email
