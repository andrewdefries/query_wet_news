   By Saabira Chaudhuri 
 National Financial Partners Corp. (NFP) has agreed to be taken private by Madison Dearborn Partners LLC for more than $1 billion, about a month after NFP, an advisory and brokerage services company, said it was exploring a possible sale. Shares jumped 6.8% to $25 in recent premarket trading, but stayed below the per-share cash offer price of $25.35. That repesents a roughly 26% premium over NFP's closing price on March 12, the last day of trading prior to media reports that NFP was considering a possible sale, and an 8.3% premium to Friday's close. The stock has risen 63% in the past 12 months. Last month NFP revealed it was exploring the sale, saying it had received "indications of interest" from private-equity firms and that its board has formed a committee of independent directors to consider the sale. The company has a market capitalization of more than $930 million, according to FactSet. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. The sale comes as longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Jessica Bibliowicz is stepping down. The company about a year ago said Ms. Bibliowicz, daughter of Wall Street legend Sandy Weill, would hand the CEO duties to Chief Operating Officer Douglas Hammond in April. Ms. Bibliowicz would become nonexecutive chairman. In February, NFP reported its fourth-quarter profit jumped 73% as revenue rose and the company benefited from comparison with a year-earlier period that was bogged down by larger impairment charges. The company has expanded dramatically during Ms. Bibliowicz's 14-year tenure by acquiring a number of smaller advisory firms. Write to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@dowjones.com Email

U.S. cattle prices jumped to a record Friday, setting up a fresh hit of sticker shock for consumers at the grocer's meat counter. Meatpackers this past week paid the highest cash prices on record for live, slaughter-ready cattle in the major producing states of Kansas, Nebraska and Texas. That led traders to bid up futures prices, which already had been rising as retailers increased beef purchases for the holidays and the meat...

The financial overhaul will be a mixed blessing for consumers. Based on the current legislation, homeowners will get additional protections from abusive loans. Free credit reports will include numerical credit scores, and fees could decline for using some automated-teller machines. More merchants are likely to offer discounts to shoppers who pay with cash, and consumers will no longer be forced into arbitration when they have disputes with lenders. Enlarge Image
Shoppers in New York last month. More merchants are likely to offer discounts to those who pay in cash.
Getty Images The bad news for consumers: Banks are expected to respond to the regulatory shake-up with more fees on basic services such as checking accounts. Merchants will be permitted to set minimum-purchase amounts for credit-card transactions. Some bank executives already are talking about scaling back debit-card rewards programs to make up for foregone revenue. Industry executives and consumer advocates agree that the overhaul will dramatically reshape the relationship between banks and retail customers. "I think it will be the most significant legal development affecting consumer financial services in our lifetime," said Thomas Brown, a partner at law firm O'Melveny & Myers LLP in San Francisco. Both the Senate and House versions of the bill call for the creation of a new consumer-protection agency that would have broad authority to write and enforce rules on financial products ranging from mortgages to credit cards to payday loans. Lawmakers still have to iron out key differences, including how the agency would be structured and funded. Federal and state officials will have the power to enforce rules issued by the new agency, but consumers haven't been given the right to file their own lawsuits for violations of those rules. It will likely take months for the agency to get up and running. Even then, the rule-making process could be daunting. The Senate version of the legislation would require the agency to solicit input from small-business representatives before proposing any rule that could affect such entrepreneurs. The requirement "will delay rule-making," said Lauren Saunders, managing attorney of the National Consumer Law Center, and that could give certain industries "a chance to shape the rules even before they are proposed." The mortgage industry, under fire for questionable and abusive lending practices, will face some immediate changes. The proposed legislation limits the ability of mortgage lenders to charge "prepayment penalties," which are special fees that some borrowers must pay if their loan is paid off early. Such penalties would be banned for certain riskier mortgages and limited for traditional loans like 30-year mortgages carrying a fixed interest rate. The bill also takes aim at mortgage-industry pay practices. It prohibits paying brokers and loan officers more to steer borrowers to higher interest rates or certain risky features. Commissions would be based on the size or number of loans originated. The bill also requires lenders to determine whether a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay the mortgage. The bill doesn't ban particular types of loans, but lenders are likely to shy away from loans that are perceived as riskier because they could face potential litigation, said John Courson, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. Still, Congress hasn't resolved some widely noted kinks. Comparison shopping for a mortgage still will be difficult, since there is no clear standard for the total cost of a loan. Some of the consumer benefits likely will take time to materialize. For example, an amendment tucked into the Senate bill last week could limit how much banks could charge merchants for debit-card transactions. It isn't clear, though, if merchants will pass along their savings on so-called interchange fees to customers. The Senate bill doesn't explicitly address credit-cards fees, but the new consumer-protection agency would have the ability to impose rules on card issuers, which were already hit with a new federal law earlier this year that clamped down on some of their most controversial practices. Among other things, the law restricted a card company's ability to raise interest rates on existing balances if a customer missed a payment for more than 60 days.

Takeshi Uchiyamada, outgoing vice chairman and newly appointed chairman of Toyota, center, speaks while Akio Toyoda, president, left, and Fujio Cho, outgoing chairman and newly appointed honorary chairman, listen Wednesday.
Bloomberg News The Japanese auto maker on Wednesday announced its biggest management overhaul since founding-family scion Akio Toyoda
took over as president in 2009. The moves will open up the world's No. 1 auto maker to its first outside directors in its 76-year history, accelerate generational change in the executive ranks and streamline the company's decision-making. Among the three outside directors named to the board is Mark Hogan,
a former General Motors Co.

executive who once ran a now-dissolved California joint venture between Toyota and GM. Mr. Toyoda said the reorganization was undertaken to better enable the Japanese company to handle growth as it continues its push beyond a string of challenges, such as a massive recall at the start of his tenure. "The objective of the changes being announced today is to build an organization where people can take ownership of their work as we enter a new phase of growth in vehicle sales," he said at a news conference in Tokyo. Some analysts evaluated the moves favorably, especially a decision to have company units focus on specific products, and a decision to appoint Takeshi Uchiyamada
as chairman. Mr. Uchiyamada is seen as the driving force behind Toyota's successful hybrid vehicle, the Prius. The changes mark a generational shift at Toyota, as Mr. Toyoda bids farewell to some of his closest allies. Three executive vice presidents and the current chairman, Fujio Cho,
will retire. Two deputies will be promoted. Commenting on the move to appoint outside directors for the first time, despite the relative insularity of Japanese businesses, Mr. Toyoda said the company wants to improve transparency after years of requests by shareholders to take on external board members. "As a global company, we'd like people to view us as an open company," he said. Toyota will condense its businesses into four main units, creating a structure that the company said should "clarify operations and earnings responsibility as well as speed up decision-making." The units include one for the developed markets of North America, Europe and Japan, another for emerging markets such as China and Latin America, and one to run the company's Lexus operations. The fourth unit will focus on the development and production of vehicle components such as engines and transmissions. As part of Wednesday's changes, Toyota named James Lentz
to lead its efforts in North America. Mr. Lentz currently heads Toyota sales in the U.S. Mr. Toyoda said it is time to look forward. "My first four years were filled with challenges, which we all worked hard to overcome," he said. Those obstacles included a recall over allegations of unintended sudden acceleration by Toyota vehicles, a problem that raised questions about the company's quality control, safety measures and customer service. The company also confronted supply-chain disruptions after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and a persistently strong yen that undercut profit. But despite several difficult years, Toyota has returned to the top, regaining the crown as the world's No. 1-selling auto maker for the first time in two years in 2012. Mr. Toyoda emphasized on Wednesday that growth, however, doesn't necessarily equal success. He said the company must put a system in place that can cope with fast-paced growth. "Rapid growth can also mean rapid descent, causing trouble for many people," he said. The larger Toyota becomes, the more difficult it becomes to foster a sense where each worker feels he or she plays a direct role in supporting Toyota." The retiring executives are some of Mr. Toyoda's closest and most experienced lieutenants, and were pivotal in steering Japan's largest auto maker through its difficult times. Shinichi Sasaki,
who was in charge of quality control, played a key role in handling the 2009 recall. Mr. Sasaki will retire along with Atsushi Niimi,
who oversaw production and the auto maker's booming North American business, and Yukitoshi Funo,
who led the emerging-markets business. All three were appointed to their current positions at the same time Mr. Toyoda, the grandson of the founder, became president. "I take [all these changes] as a clear statement by the company that it will reinforce its manufacturing prowess," said Satoshi Nagashima,
a senior partner at consulting firm Roland Berger, referring to Mr. Uchiyamada's appointment and the new structure that will allow each business unit to focus on specific products, such as mass-market cars and upscale vehicles. The move by Toyota—Japan's largest company by revenue—to add outside directors to its board marks a significant shift, not just for the auto maker, but also for corporate Japan. Major Japanese companies have, historically, been reluctant to bring outsiders into the boardroom, a pattern that many corporate-governance experts have said has led to insular management and a number of high-profile corporate scandals in recent years. As of March 2011, just 47% of the companies listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange had outside directors, according to the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, a government-affiliated think tank. Of those, the majority had just one. Outside directors made up about 10% of all board members for the TSE
top-tier companies—compared with 70% in the U.S., 50% in the U.K. and more than 30% in South Korea, the institute said. Under Toyota's new board, three of 16 directors, or 19%, will be outsiders. In addition to Mr. Hogan, the company said it is nominating as directors a Japanese life-insurance executive and the head of a company in charge of clearing and settling securities transactions. The management changes will take place pending a vote at the annual general shareholders' meeting in June.

LAKE FOREST, Calif.—Jeff Pintar had buyer's remorse as he purchased 12 foreclosed homes in five Southern California counties on a single day. His regret: that he didn't buy more homes a year earlier. "Things have turned around faster than anyone anticipated," said Mr. Pintar, who first began buying properties here four years ago and now owns or manages 1,700 homes, which he rents out for between $1,000 and $3,800 a month....

is aiming to become more Chinese as it plans a rapid expansion in the country. Belinda Wong,
president of Starbucks China, said in an interview that Starbucks aims to roll out 800 new stores in the next three years to add to its existing fleet of 700. Over that period it will increase the number of employees to more than 30,000 from the current 12,000. Enlarge Image
The company aims to capture a larger market by going more local and applying its cultural insights, Ms. Wong said. For instance, whereas kiosk-sized stores work well in the U.S., where office workers grab bacon-gouda sandwiches to go in the morning on the way to work, Starbucks has learned that Chinese consumers value space and couches on which to relax in the afternoons. The coffee company is adding some stores that are nearly 3,800 square feet and can seat consumers who come with groups of friends and business partners. Starbucks also has discovered that Chinese tastes for coffee go only so far. It plans to introduce new Chinese-inspired flavors, building on existing favorites like red bean frappuccinos. Localization is a critical factor in the success or failure of foreign companies in China. Yum Brands Inc.

Starbucks has just eight branches in the Nordics, but this is all about to change. WSJ's John Stoll has the latest on plans to expand in the region.
Coffee Prices Fall, but Not at Starbucks Starbucks' New Cafes Serving Wine and Champagne The Case of the Missing Pumpkin Latte Starbucks's Ms. Wong said the Seattle-based company understands the complexities of operating in a country where consumers in smaller cities are just getting their first Starbucks and where established big-city coffee drinkers already need upgraded stores. The coffee company has recently hired local graffiti artists to redecorate one of its older stores in Beijing's popular Sanlitun Village, a shopping district that, like New York's Soho, attracts the young and wealthy and sparks trends. Starbucks is also coming to the realization that family expectations will have a big impact on its success. To retain its employees, whose parents would rather their children be working behind bank counters than serving up Sumatra, Starbucks earlier this year launched a family forum, inviting parents to hear testimonies from managers who have worked their way up the career ladder. "We don't do one size fits all," said Ms. Wong, noting that over the past two years Starbucks has opened a Chinese design center to build out its new stores and has launched a research and development center to fill the stores with sandwiches like the Hainan chicken and rice wrap or the Thai-style prawn wrap. The company is aiming to cater to noncoffee drinkers like Cheng Xiaochen, a 27-year-old English teacher who hates coffee but occasionally meets his students and business partners at Starbucks in the afternoon. "It's a good place to meet people," said Mr. Cheng. "But the coffee is so bitter it tastes like Chinese medicine." Mr. Cheng said he sticks to mint hot chocolate and looks for other sweeter flavors. China remains a tea-drinking nation, but coffee sales rose 20% in 2011 from a year earlier, reaching 6.25 billion yuan ($995 million), according to market research firm Euromonitor International. China is an important growth market for Starbucks, whose executives want the country to become its largest market outside the U.S. The company doesn't break out China sales, but executives said this month that China-based sales have increased 52% year-over-year. They didn't offer further details. Industry watchers say that although Starbucks has been successful in China, it faces challenges. Food companies from U.K.-based Whitbread

PLC's Costa Coffee to Korean SPC Group's Paris Baguette, are expanding rapidly across China, said Torsten Stocker, an analyst for consultancy Monitor Group. "All of these are not only fighting to increase their 'share of stomach,' but also for top real-estate locations and the talent to expand and manage their stores," said Mr. Stocker. Experts agree that corporate localization in China is crucial, as most consumers have culturally entrenched tastes that differ from Western ones. While China has an elite band of consumers who buy only foreign brands, the typical consumer is more parochial. Still, some caution that Starbucks can't veer too far from its Western image. "It's extremely critical to keep authenticity and consistency," said Vincent Lui, a partner of Boston Consulting Group. Such worries would be misplaced, Ms. Wong said, as Starbucks aims for the authentic experience. While Starbucks is planning to hype Chinese New Year more than ever this year, it has just rolled out its U.S. Christmas cups for the Chinese stores.
