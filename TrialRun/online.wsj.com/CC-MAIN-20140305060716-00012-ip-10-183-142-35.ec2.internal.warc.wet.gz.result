Most of us watching the looming budget showdown do so with a sense of dread. The last one left congressional approval at 9%, the president's popularity at a new low, and consumer confidence at levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. The trouble, of course, is finding common ground on a 10-year budget framework or even on a six-week punt. Hopefully, they will find common ground. If we are committed to evidence, though, there's one area where we ought to be able to agree: early-childhood education. Investments in...

Oscar winners include,'Argo' for best picture, Ang Lee for best director, Daniel Day-Lewis for best actor, Jennifer Lawrence for best actress and more. Video: AP Video Hub Photo: Getty Images
"Argo" took home the best picture prize in an Oscar ceremony that featured a wide array of winners along with a mix of traditional musical numbers and edgy humor. Director/actor Ben Affleck's film based on the true story of a CIA agent who rescued hostages from Iran by creating a fake motion-picture production, was a Hollywood comeback story. After Mr. Affleck was denied an Academy Award nomination for best director on Jan. 10, an omission that many thought spelled the end of his movie's best-picture chances, the picture went on to sweep every major award, making it a presumptive favorite by Sunday.

"Argo" also won Oscars for best adapted screenplay and editing. Its total of three is the fewest any best picture has won since "Crash" in 2006. Ang Lee won the best director Oscar for "Life of Pi," beating out Steven Spielberg for "Lincoln," who had been considered his most formidable competitor in the category. Daniel Day-Lewis, a heavy favorite going into the night, won the best actor prize for his title role in "Lincoln." It's the actor's third Oscar for best actor. He previously won for 2007s "There Will Be Blood and 1989s "My Left Foot." Jennifer Lawrence, 22, won the best actress prize for her performance as woman coping with grief in "Silver Linings Playbook," released by Weinstein Co. The category was a closely contested one in which Jessica Chastain was also considered a likely winner for her lead role in "Zero Dark Thirty." The original screenplay prize went to Quentin Tarantino for his slavery revenge movie "Django Unchained." He previously won in 1995 for "Pulp Fiction."

Oscar night is over, so who waltzed off the red carpet looking their best? From Jennifer Lawrence's stunning gown, to Anne Hathaway's last minute pick, WSJ's Elizabeth Holmes breaks down the best and worst of Oscar style.
Host Seth MacFarlane, the creator of the animated series "Family Guy" and last summer's hit movie "Ted," sought to tread a careful line between respect and comedy throughout the ceremony. At the opening of the show, he enlisted William Shatner, playing Captain Kirk from "Star Trek," to show a series of offensive skits Mr. MacFarlane performed in an alternate future. In them, he made fun of famous actresses for their frequent nudity, re-enacted the alcohol- and drug-filled movie "Flight" with sock puppets, and propositioned Sally Field, nominated for her role in "Lincoln." The star-filled audience, which initially reacted hesitantly to jokes about Mel Gibson and Chris Brown, seemed to warm to Mr. MacFarlane as he mixed his "fake" skits with musical numbers more in the tradition of past hosts like Billy Crystal. But his humor was hit-and-miss throughout. A joke about John Wilkes Booth and "Lincoln" fell particularly flat.

Explosions, stampedes and pig-like monsters - rare in a film made on a $1.5 million budget. But possible thanks to SF Academy of Art University students who did most of the special effects for "Beasts of the Southern Wild." WSJ's Linda Freund reports.
In the evening's first award, Christoph Waltz took home the supporting actor prize for his role as a bounty hunter in Weinstein Co.'s "Django Unchained." While Mr. Waltz had won a Golden Globe in the same category, he was generally considered an underdog behind Tommy Lee Jones, who won the Screen Actors Guild prize for his role in "Lincoln," made by DreamWorks Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Co.

's Twentieth Century Fox, collected the awards for cinematography and visual effects, even as the studio that created many of the visuals, Rhythm & Hues Studios Inc., remained under bankruptcy-court protection. News Corp. also owns The Wall Street Journal. Walt Disney Co.'s Pixar Animation won the best animated-feature prize for "Brave." Heading into this year's Oscars, six of the computer-graphics studio's films had won Oscars, but last year its "Cars 2" didn't even rate a nomination. "Amour," about an aging couple dealing with dementia and death, won the prize for best foreign film, as was expected. Though the movie takes place in Paris, it qualified as Austrian, home country of its director, Michael Haneke. The movie, distributed in the U.S. by Sony

's Warner Bros., wasn't the leading contender. Last December, the New York Film Critics Circle and National Board of Review both named "Zero Dark Thirty," a thriller about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden, the best picture of the year. "Zero Dark" was caught up in a political controversy in which three U.S. senators, along with some activists, criticized it for what they deemed an inaccurate portrayal of the role of torture in the search for Mr. Bin Laden. That may have played a role in the omission of the movie's director, Kathryn Bigelow, from the nominees in that category along with Mr. Affleck and the drop in its support in Hollywood's predominantly liberal creative community. The movie, distributed by Sony Corp.'s Sony Pictures Entertainment, ended up winning only one Oscar, for sound editing. Before the Oscars had begun, Hollywood's studios had already won with this year's crop of nominees, the most financially successful in many years. Six of this year's nine best-picture nominees have grossed more than $100 million in the U.S. and Canada with a seventh, "Zero Dark," at just over $90 million. "Lincoln" is the most successful domestically with $178.6 million, while "Life of Pi" has collected a spectacular $471 million internationally. Write to Ben Fritz at ben.fritz@wsj.com Email

Al Jazeera used the Web to build a following in America, which it hopes to exploit on cable television through Wednesday's purchase of Current TV. But to keep cable operators happy, Al Jazeera may have to make a difficult bargain: Giving up on the Web. The Qatar government-backed television news operation, which acquired Current TV for a few hundred million dollars from investors including Al Gore,
said Thursday that it will at least temporarily stop streaming online Al Jazeera English, its global English-language news service, in about 90 days. That's when it plans to replace Current TV's programming with Al Jazeera English. Al Jazeera agreed to purchase the U.S. cable channel Current TV in an effort to expand the Qatar-based news service's U.S. audience. The WSJ's Keach Hagey explains what the move means for the media industry and why not all cable operators are on board with the deal. Photo: Getty Images.
Al Jazeera plans later to launch an entirely new channel, Al Jazeera America, that will combine programming from the existing English-language service with new material. The new channel likely won't be streamed online either, a spokesman said. And it is unclear whether the original English service will reappear online: the spokesman said Thursday a decision about that was dependent on negotiations with cable operators. The network's decision to pull its service off the Web is at the behest of cable and satellite operators. It reflects a broader conflict between pay television and online streaming that other TV channels face. Because cable and satellite operators pay networks to carry their programming, the operators don't want the programming appearing for free online. Aside from older series available through services like Netflix, most cable programming is available online only to people who subscribe to cable TV. Enlarge Image
Al Jazeera's website has developed a small following in the U.S.
Al Jazeera Earlier Al-Jazeera to Buy Current TV 1/2/2013 "We'd love to be able to do both" cable and Internet distribution, "but the deals with distributors prevent it," the Al Jazeera spokesman said. "The economics are better on cable." The irony is that for smaller outlets in particular, with limited or no cable distribution, the Web can be a powerful wedge—helping networks build an audience that makes it easier to negotiate for broader, and more profitable distribution with cable and satellite operators. "Having an online presence is critical to proving to distributors that a network's content and brand are powerful and can draw an audience and subscriptions," said Lynne Costantini,
a longtime cable distribution veteran who now consults for television networks. "But then they're also saying, 'Don't put too much stuff online for free, because then the value proposition to the cable subscriber is less.' " More Video
Al Jazeera Media is making a strong push into the American market with its purchase of Current TV. John Owen, journalism professor at the City University of London, tells the WSJ's Deborah Kan why it could be difficult for the Qatar-owned news network to break into the U.S. market.

Al Jazeera's acquisition of Current TV and the possibility of increased distribution in the U.S. still won't enable Al Jazeera to become what it wants to be—a household name here. Jon Friedman discusses on The News Hub.
Al Jazeera credits online streaming for building its profile in the U.S. "Al Jazeera's decision to create a U.S.-based news channel was based in part on the fact that Americans have already shown a great demand for its news and programs: Almost 40% of all online viewing of Al Jazeera English comes from the United States," Al Jazeera said Wednesday. The website had 971,000 unique visitors in November 2012, up from 825,000 in the same month a year earlier, according to comScore. In comparison, Time Warner Inc.

's CNN has averaged about 700,000 households watching at any given minute in primetime since late September, according to Nielsen. Al Jazeera has long sought to get national cable distribution for its English-language service—until now without success. And a major reason was that it was using the Web to stream the service, cable executives say. Currently, Al Jazeera English only airs in a few local cable markets like Washington, D.C., and Burlington, Vt. It's unclear how many of Al Jazeera's online viewers have cable. Persuading those who don't to sign up to get the network might be tough, one executive at an independent network said. "If [Al Jazeera] already has a really passionate following, that's a head start. But it's tough to win over people to cable if they don't have it already," the executive said. And Current TV itself had very limited distribution. Al Jazeera expects to reach about 40 million households as a result of the Current TV acquisition, taking into account Time Warner Cable Inc.

's dropping of Current on Wednesday as a result of the ownership change. Fully distributed networks reach upwards of 90 million subscribers. Current also had very low ratings: an average of only 22,000 households tuned into the channel between January and November at any given time. Time Warner Cable said Thursday it would keep its options open regarding Al Jazeera America. "As the service develops, we will evaluate whether it makes sense, for our customers, to launch the network," a spokeswoman said. Other channels have faced similar challenges balancing the Web and pay TV. When television personality Keith Olbermann
joined Current in 2011, he wasn't able to put his show online. Mr. Olbermann cited the restriction in a lawsuit he filed against Current. "By not streaming the program, Current destroyed the bond between Olbermann and his audience," the complaint alleged. A Current TV spokeswoman declined to comment. —Shalini Ramachandran contributed to this article. Write to John Jannarone at john.jannarone@wsj.com and Keach Hagey at keach.hagey@wsj.com Email

Congressional Leaders Discuss Deal to Avert Shutdown at Cost of Extending Cuts
By
Janet Hook And Peter Nicholas Feb. 24, 2013 8:32 p.m. ET
Already looking past the current budget impasse gripping the capital, congressional leaders are quietly considering a deal to avert a government shutdown next month—but at the cost of prolonging across-the-board spending cuts. Attention is beginning to shift from Friday, when the broad cuts known as the sequester kick in, to the next budget deadline: Congress must pass a so-called continuing resolution by the end of March to keep...

It is the equivalent of articles that worry about the health of the American shopper, who "makes up 70% of the economy." If retail sales figures, due Monday from the Commerce Department, continue their recent weak spell,...

The National Weather Service says a big winter storm with near-hurricane force winds could drop up to two feet of snow in New England Friday and Saturday. Photo: AP.
The Northeastern U.S. braced for what the National Weather Service called a "potentially historic" blizzard that threatened to dump as much as 2 feet of snow across a swath of New England and the mid-Atlantic. It is expected to disrupt travel, close schools and knock out power. Brian Kahn joins the News Hub to give an update on the path of a massive blizzard that is expected to pound the Northeast Friday night and Saturday. Nearly 3,000 flights have been canceled because of the storm. Photo: Getty Images.
The NWS warned that the blizzard, which is expected to hit Friday and reach its peak intensity early Saturday morning, could make road travel "near impossible at times with considerable blowing and drifting snow." The storm could cause disruptions from the eastern Great Lakes to Cape Cod, officials said. Enlarge Image

Reuters Related Metropolis: Big Blizzard Heads for Big Apple "Accumulation is expected to be swift, heavy, and dangerous," warned Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick,
urging nonemergency drivers to be off the roads by noon Friday. Mr. Patrick said the entire Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority system, including buses and commuter rails, will cease service at 3:30 p.m. Friday. He said all nonemergency state employees would work from home and urged private employers to let their staffs do the same. He said all four of the state's public utilities have filed action plans and have begun to position crews, treat roads, and call in out-of state resources. Some 500 National Guard members were being called up Thursday night—with a total of 5,000 and 6,000 available to assist during the storm, Mr. Patrick said. View Slideshow
Pedestrians walked along Delancey Street in New York during the morning rush hour Friday.
Mary Altaffer/Associated Press "By all accounts, we are expecting a serious weather event," he said, adding that the storm was likely to start as a light snow on Friday morning and become heavier as the day goes on, with the worst coming between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., and continuing through the day on Saturday. By Friday morning, airlines had canceled more than 2,700 flights through Saturday, the Associated Press reported. Officials planned to cancel all flights at Boston's Logan airport starting Friday afternoon. Amtrak said it would halt service in the northeast beginning shortly after midday on Friday. States and municipalities mobilized thousands of plows, salt trucks and other equipment from the southern shores of New Jersey to Maine. New England was expected to bear the brunt of the storm, but up to 20 inches of snow were expected in the New York City area, parts of which are still recovering from Sandy, which hit the area in late October. Many people heeded the warnings. Grocery stores across the region were packed Thursday as people stocked up on provisions. The Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency warned of possible power outages and urged residents to gather supplies such as warm clothes and blankets. "Keeping warm during winter power outages is critical, especially for the elderly or for people who are not physically active or use life-sustaining equipment," said Theresa Murray, the agency's executive director. Schools in Boston, Providence and other cities announced they would be closed Friday. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino urged companies in the city to let their employees work from home if possible during the storm. Meetings and public events across southern New England were canceled. Wind gusts could reach up to 60 miles an hour with storm surges in coastal areas of three to five feet, weather officials said. Local authorities said they were concerned that flooding and storm surges could wreck dunes and beaches that have been rebuilding over what so far has been a mild winter. Portland, Maine, has seen about 35 inches of snow this season. The average is 37.5 inches. Just 10.7 inches of snow has been recorded so far this winter at Boston's Logan Airport, nearly 15 inches below normal, said Eric Schwibs, an NWS meteorologist in Portland, Maine. "Boston is going to catch up in a hurry," he said. —Jack Nicas and Jon Kamp contributed to this article.

People reunite, separate, rush and wait at Grand Central Terminal earlier this month—much as they have over the last century. Click the image above to see more photos of everyday life at the station, captured by WSJ's Kurt Wilberding ahead of the centennial.
It was the ribbed seam on the back of a stocking that inspired Leo Ackerman
to tap a young woman on the shoulder in the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal in 1948 and ask her what she was doing later that evening. Mollie Zessin,
then 24 years old, replied that she would be attending a Jewish dance at the Metropolitan Club and coyly told him he could join her. Mr. Ackerman, the dashing owner of a male modeling agency and an occasional hat model himself, kept the date. Three months later, they were married. Video: Grand Central Time-Lapse
Rushing commuters, confused tourists, and headphone-wearing travelers all comprise the average day at Grand Central Terminal. WSJ's Keith Bedford captured the sights and sounds this week in a time-lapse video to mark the train station's centennial.

Below Grand Central, Digging for the Future
Deep below Midtown Manhattan, the $8.2 billion East Side Access project is making progress as it excavates a sprawling set of caverns and tunnels below Grand Central Terminal that will become a Long Island Rail Road station and concourse by 2019. WSJ's Jennifer Weiss reports.
From Metropolis Rethinking Grand Central's Crowded Second Century More on Grand Central's Future Grand Central Terminal, a birthplace of modern commuting celebrating its 100th birthday on Friday, stands as a symbol of the comings and goings of the city and the nation—the scene of more boisterous hellos and tearful goodbyes than can be counted. Ten decades of meetings and greetings have inspired generations of photographers and writers who have immortalized the station in works ranging from Alfred Hitchcock's
"North by Northwest" to the TV show "Gossip Girl." The building has become enmeshed in the emotional memories of the masses who pass through it. Mr. Ackerman retold the story of his life-changing encounter at the landmark station so many times that the tale has become the stuff of family lore. "The last time I saw my grandfather before he died, he told me again about meeting my grandmother in Grand Central," said Ruthie Ackerman, his granddaughter. "I love the idea that a bold young man and a stylish woman in ribbed stockings can meet and fall in love in the same place I pass through every day to get to work." "It's such a transient space with people coming and going," she added, "it still amazes me that people slow down long enough to fall in love." Katherine Oliver,
commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment, describes the terminal as one of the more sought-after locations for filming in New York City. Last year, officials said, approximately 500 permits were issued for filming and photography inside Grand Central. "It creates the backdrop for an emotional scene for someone anxiously awaiting a loved one or bidding farewell," Ms. Oliver said. From 1915 until the 1990s, the Beaux Arts building even contained a special place apart from the hustle and bustle of the main floor that was designated for loved ones in the throes of an extra special hello. An area adjacent to the arriving long-distance trains—officially dubbed the Incoming Train Room—hosted reunions between sweethearts and military men returning from war. "Everyone was greeting people from around the country, so obviously there was a lot of kissing going on there," said Metro-North spokeswoman Marjorie Anders, explaining how the room acquired its more famous moniker: "The Kissing Room."

Lindsey Green has always loved Grand Central. And now, as a New Yorker displaced from her home by superstorm Sandy, she goes there to feel a moment of calm.
Daniella Zalcman for The Wall Street Journal Transit officials are hoping to bring back more of the kissing in 2019, when a massive expansion to the station in the $8.2 billion East Side Access megaproject adds a pair of escalators that will once again make it a meeting spot. When Cynthia MacGregor's
parents took her to Grand Central before summer camp each July from 1954 to 1959, the last thing she wanted was a kiss. "I totally ignored my parents the second we got into Grand Central," she recalled. Instead, she was busy looking for her bunkmates—and she can still recite their names: Terry, Rosemary, Janet, Myra and Sherry. From the Midtown terminal, the girls would head off each summer to the Berkshire mountains in Massachusetts. And they wanted nothing more than to be loose from their parents and to board the train, where they would sing for hours. "The parents had separation anxiety," remembered Ms. MacGregor, now 69. "But most of the kids were eager to get to camp and ignored our parents." Lindsey Green
felt a different kind of separation anxiety last November as she visited the main room of Grand Central three times in a three-week span. Ms. Green, a public relations and communications consultant, was evacuated from her apartment near Peck Slip in Lower Manhattan after superstorm Sandy. The lobby took in eight feet of water, forcing Ms. Green and her boyfriend to decamp to Brooklyn's Cobble Hill neighborhood. Frequent post-storm visits to Grand Central were her way of saying goodbye to the borough she'd called home for nearly a decade. "Grand Central has always been my zen place. It is the place that says New York to me," she said. Growing up in Florida, Ms. Green kept old photographs of Grand Central in notebooks, which ultimately inspired her to move to New York. On her first day in the city, she spent hours just watching people come and go from inside the old station's hallowed halls. "When I knew evacuation would mean leaving Manhattan for Brooklyn, the only place I felt the need to spend time in was Grand Central," she said. "It gives me clarity when things are incredibly out of sorts."

Protesters chant slogans against President Morsi Thursday in front of a barricade guarded by a tank outside the presidential palace in Cairo.
Reuters CAIRO—Egypt President Mohammed Morsi
made a tentative concession to his opponents Thursday after the government deployed tanks to end demonstrations by the presidential palace, as planned protests threatened more violence on Friday. Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi addressed his people late Thursday as his nation's army deployed tanks to clear the area outside the presidential palace following fierce street battles. Matt Bradley has details on The News Hub. Photo: Getty Images.
In a late-night address to the nation, Mr. Morsi invited political leaders to meet with him on Saturday to discuss withdrawing a controversial article from a constitutional declaration that awarded the president near absolute power late last month. By falling so short of their demands, some opposition leaders said the speech was more likely to inflame protests against Mr. Morsi's recently expanded powers than to assuage them. Mr. Morsi's speech was followed immediately by violence. The Cairo headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the powerful Islamist organization Mr. Morsi once led, was set on fire, according to the group's official Twitter account. There were no immediate reports of injuries. More than 30 Brotherhood buildings have been set alight since violent confrontations between secularists and Islamists began late last month, said Gehad al Haddad, an adviser to the Brotherhood's leadership.

The Egyptian army deployed tanks Thursday in Cairo.
Nasser Nasser/Associated Press Read More Egypt Sees Largest Clashes Since Revolution In his speech, Mr. Morsi made no offer to meet opposition demands that he reschedule a Dec. 15 referendum on a proposed constitution. But he pledged to form a new assembly to write another constitution if the current draft is rejected in the national vote. Speaking with a level voice and displaying little emotion, Mr. Morsi castigated his opponents, accusing them of acting in the thrall of former regime loyalists and foreign saboteurs, while casting himself as the final protector of Egypt's security and stability. Enlarge Image
An Egyptian protester on Wednesday in Cairo holds a placard reading in Arabic, "Morsi is not allowed in."
European Pressphoto Agency "It is my duty to safeguard the homeland, to work relentlessly for its stability and the safety of all its citizens," he said. Activists said the speech's unyielding tone was redolent of the kind of the political hubris that has marked the beginning of the end for a series of Arab leaders who were eventually toppled by public protests and armed mutinies throughout the so-called Arab Spring, including former Egypt President Hosni Mubarak.
"This is the same Mubarak speech," said Wael Eskandar, a prominent, secular-leaning activist, blogger and journalist. Mr. Mubarak's late concessions only further angered a public already in the throes of dissent. "This is what happens with dictators," Mr. Eskandar said. "They become obstinate and they keep pushing for what they want and offer no concessions until they start losing on the ground." The White House said President Barack Obama called Mr. Morsi to express his concern about the deaths and injuries of protesters and welcomed the Egyptian leader's call for a dialogue, which Mr. Obama said "should occur without preconditions." Two spokesmen for opposition political parties said it was unclear Thursday night whether they would send representatives to Mr. Morsi's Saturday dialogue. But protests scheduled for Friday appeared set to proceed. Police have stepped in to separate pro- and anti-government demonstrators outside the presidential palace in Cairo. WSJ's Matt Bradley reports on further violence overnight and the possibility of an escalation in the runup to Friday prayers.
Demonstrations outside the Egyptian Presidential Palace in Cairo turned violent as Islamist demonstrators supporting president Mohammed Morsi clashed with secular protesters who oppose him. Video by WSJ's Matt Bradley via #WorldStream.
Mr. Morsi outraged his opponents and many of his supporters when he expanded his own powers late last month at the expense of the country's judges. The president and the powerful Brotherhood organization that backs him say the judiciary is stocked with former Mubarak loyalists intent on overthrowing his new Islamist government. To avoid a confrontation with the judges, Mr. Morsi's allies in a constitutional drafting panel rushed to approve a draft of the document days before an Egyptian court was scheduled to rule on the committee's legitimacy. But Mr. Morsi's opponents—among them the youthful revolutionaries who spearheaded Mr. Mubarak's downfall nearly two years ago—said the president's decree and his handling of the constitution smacked of an Islamist putsch. Mr. Haddad said that the president has always been open to dialogue, but that his opponents remain so unorganized they can't even articulate a unified set of demands. Instead, Mr. Morsi's opponents are motivated more by suspicion of an Islamist leader and resentment over his popularity than Mr. Morsi's aggressive political moves, he said. "I think that this reinforces the fact that the door is still open," Mr. Haddad said. "We can't help that they lost the presidential election. Going on TV channels and whining about it isn't going to help." The president's speech came on the back of some of the most shocking violence that has afflicted Egypt's two-year-long postrevolutionary transition. Clashes between Mr. Morsi's supporters and his mostly secular opponents near the presidential palace on Wednesday night left six people dead and more than 400 injured, according to the official state news agency.

Mr. Morsi addresses the nation.
Associated Press The Republican Guard, an elite military unit charged with protecting the president, deployed tanks and armored cars in front of the presidential palace on Thursday morning to keep order. The Islamist protesters who had camped their overnight left quietly after the soldiers issued a 3 p.m. ultimatum. In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Morsi addressed the previous night's violence directly, using it to justify his own extraordinary expansion of power. "Those who have taken advantage of the situation—paying thugs, buying arms, handing out money—the time has come for them to be penalized by the law," the president said. "Confessions" from thugs revealed that they had been paid, Mr. Morsi said. "Today I would like to reiterate that the facts that made me hand down the presidential decree are represented in the events threatening the security of the homeland."

Most Households Face 'Fiscal Cliff'
Lower-Income People in Particular Would See Steep Tax Increases if Washington Can't End Budget Dilemma by Year-End
By
John D. McKinnon, Kristina Peterson and Josh Mitchell Updated Nov. 27, 2012 10:41 a.m. ET
Almost all American households would take a financial blow next year—and low-income families would be among the hardest hit—if the White House and Congress fail to solve the "fiscal cliff" of big tax increases and spending cuts set to start Jan 2. A married couple making between $20,000 and $30,000 a year would go from receiving, on average, a $15 tax credit to owing $1,408, according to research by the Tax Policy Center,...

technology conference Tuesday in San Francisco, were his first public comments about the suit, which was filed by Mr. Einhorn's Greenlight Capital Inc. last week in a New York federal court. Greenlight's suit aims to stop the vote on an Apple proposal to require a shareholder vote to issue preferred stock. It alleges that Apple's proxy violates a rule of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by bundling the preferred-stock provision together with other items. Apple CEO Tim Cook called the company's proxy fight with a prominent investor a "silly sideshow" and defended the introductions of new products that might cannibalize existing wares. Jessica Lessin joins the News Hub. Photo: AP.

More Cook's Speech: Five Takeaways Recap: Cook Gives Keynote at Goldman Conference Funds Slice Apple Holdings Corporate Cash Hoard Continues Growing Einhorn Squeezes Apple for Its Cash "I find it bizarre we would find ourselves being sued for doing something that's good for shareholders," Mr. Cook said. "I think it would be a lot better use of funds to donate that time and money to a worthy cause." Mr. Einhorn is pursuing the measure as he tries to prod Apple to return more of its $137 billion in cash to shareholders through a new preferred class of stock that would issue dividends. Mr. Cook called the idea "creative" and said Apple is in "very active discussions" about returning more cash to shareholders. Last year, the Cupertino, Calif., company announced plans to return $45 billion over three years through a dividend and stock-buyback programs. A spokesman for Greenlight responded by saying, "If Apple thinks the lawsuit is a waste of resources, it could simply end the matter by complying with existing law" by unbundling the proposed changes. On Tuesday, shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co. said it supported Apple's proposal. Glass Lewis said that it was "somewhat concerned" with the bundling of items in the proposal, however. Institutional Shareholder Services sided with Apple on the proposal last week. Enlarge Image
Apple CEO Tim Cook, shown at a San Jose, Calif., event in October, says the company's cash pile 'is not burning a hole in our pocket.'
Bloomberg News Mr. Cook said the cash pile "is not burning a hole in our pocket" and the company has made an acquisition about every other month for the past three years. The deals tend to be small and related to controlling the "primary technology behind our products." Apple has looked at large acquisitions, but "it didn't pass our test." He said Apple will likely look at large deals in the future, but aims to have a "disciplined and thoughtful" acquisition strategy. "We don't feel a pressure to go out and acquire revenue," he said. Apple shares were trading up about 1% during much of Mr. Cook's keynote interview Tuesday morning, but they fell afterward, ending down 2.5% at $467.90. The stock has taken a hit after Apple last month reported slowing fourth-quarter revenue and profit growth. The results further fanned concerns about consumer demand for Apple's devices. Some investors said Mr. Cook's remarks gave them confidence in the company's growth. "I liked his answers," said Morris Mark,
president of Mark Asset Management in New York. He said he was encouraged that Mr. Cook was "not dismissive" of Mr. Einhorn's proposal. Mr. Mark said his firm sold a "material" amount of Apple stock last year, but lately has been holding or moderately increasing its position. Mr. Cook grew animated when the conversation veered toward Apple's culture and innovation track record, repeating his oft-used phrase that innovation at the company "has never been stronger." He played down concerns over iPhone market-share growth. He said only half of global wireless subscribers currently have access to the iPhone, leaving plenty of room for expansion. Mr. Cook wouldn't detail whether Apple would consider making a cheaper version of the iPhone, especially for prepaid wireless customers in emerging markets. He stressed the company has taken steps to make products more affordable and highlighted its broad line of iPod media players that come in different models. "The only thing we will never do is make a crappy product," he said. Mr. Cook said the company was surprised by the level of demand for the two-generation-old iPhone 4 in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., the device is generally free at wireless carriers when customers sign a two-year service contract, and supply was constrained for much of the period. He also said Apple plans to invest heavily in its retail stores, which averaged more than $50 million in revenue per store last year. This fiscal year, Apple plans to expand the size of 20 stores and add 30 more world-wide. He said that when he needs a pick-me-up, he visits one of the company's stores, which he likened to "Prozac."
