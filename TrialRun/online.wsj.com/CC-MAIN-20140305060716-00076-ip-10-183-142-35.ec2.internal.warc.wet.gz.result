Updated Sept. 23, 2013 5:36 a.m. ET
Kenyan police seek to clear terrorists from an upscale mall after an attack that killed more than 60 people, with as many as 40 more still missing and perhaps held hostage. The WSJ's Heidi Vogt has the details.
NAIROBI, Kenya—Kenyan police late Sunday struck to end a two-day terrorist attack at an upscale mall after the death toll rose to 68, with some 40 people believed trapped inside the complex while armed militants remained at large. But the terrorist siege of an upscale Nairobi shopping mall pushed into a third day Monday morning, with a round of shooting sounding after dawn as helicopters circled overhead. "I heard about five shots going together," said Samuel Gitau, a driver who had dropped a client off at an office nearby. "It's been on and off like that for a while." Kenyan security forces had said late Sunday that they were making a final push against the 10-15 attackers inside and that they expected the standoff to end that night. Instead the country continued to wait anxiously for the end to a siege that began Saturday, targeting a lunchtime crowd filled with families—both Kenyan and foreign. It was unclear how many people were trapped inside and whether they were being held hostage or were in hiding. Red Cross estimates put the number still missing at about 40. Attackers stormed at least three entrances to the mall simultaneously when the attack began Saturday. Gunfire ripped through open-air cafes at the main entrance, while a grenade exploded in the rooftop parking lot and another group of shooters opened fire in the basement garage.

EPA A French man eating at a tapas bar said a gunman yelled "Allahu akbar!"—Arabic for "God is Great!"—as he opened fire on the diners. "Their mission was to kill, not to steal," said Edwin Omoding,
a 26-year-old stocker for the Nakumatt supermarket inside the mall. He said he saw about 20 attackers, including three women. Mr. Omoding said the attackers identified themselves as members of al-Shabaab, a Somali militant group that has long threatened a major attack against Kenya as retribution for its decision to send troops to help the Somali government fight the insurgents. Twitter messages purportedly from the group claimed responsibility for the attack and taunted the Kenyan government throughout the siege. "They were questioning people, and they said, 'If you are Muslim you are on the safer side, but if you are Hindu or Christian you will be killed,' " Mr. Omoding said. Enlarge Image
Kenyan soldiers on Sunday morning outside the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, under attack by armed militants.
Associated Press He said he and four others hid next to a large walk-in refrigerator, while other people hid in the refrigerator itself. At one point the attackers shot everyone inside the refrigerator, without noticing his group. Mr. Omoding said a bullet grazed his chest but he kept quiet and remained unseen, and was rescued at 9 p.m. Saturday. Peter Outa, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said late Sunday that at least 68 people had been confirmed killed. Among them were three Britons, two Canadians including a diplomat, two French women and a prominent Ghanaian poet, their governments said. The local press reported that a Kenyan radio presenter was killed on the roof, and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta
said his nephew and the nephew's fiancée died in the attack. When the shooting started, some in the mall ran in one direction only to find themselves facing another flank of shooters. "We tried to escape through the main gate, but the attackers were also coming through that gate. So we turned and tried to go back to the basement," said Peter Ouma,
a 25-year-old construction worker. Mr. Ouma, who was in the basement when attackers entered, said they were dressed in black with their faces masked "like ninjas." He said there was one woman in that group. "They were at all the exits; even if you wanted to escape you couldn't," Mr. Ouma said. He first hid with about 10 others under a stairwell, then managed to slide underneath a car in the parking garage and stayed there until he was rescued by soldiers Sunday morning. Enlarge Image
The deadliest attack to hit Kenya since the 1998 U.S. embassy bombing started around 12:30 p.m. local time Saturday. Most of Westgate's shops are on three main levels, with a few more in the basement and a movie theater that extends up onto a higher level. When news of an attack there first filtered out to the city through phone calls and text messages, initial assumptions were that it was a robbery, a common occurrence in a crime-ridden city where going into shopping centers requires handbag searches and a once-over with a metal detector. But inside the mall, the scene was bloody. A waitress at the popular ArtCaffe restaurant said men entered the dining area and just started shooting the patrons. Over the course of the day, Kenyan police and soldiers slowly pushed in, ushering out people who were hiding in restrooms, banks' safe rooms or the depths of restaurant kitchens. Security forces sought to surround the attackers without knowing how many there were, where they were holed up or whether they had hostages. As of Sunday night, many people still hadn't made it out. The Kenyan Red Cross said 49 people had been reported missing by family or friends and were believed still inside. The Red Cross later said that nine bodies had been found. President Kenyatta called the assault an "evil and cowardly act of terrorism" and vowed to continue to fight against the Somali militants. "I want to be very clear and categorical: We shall not relent on the war on terror. We will continue that fight, and we urge all people of goodwill throughout the world to join us and to ensure that we uproot this evil," he said. More than 175 were injured in the attack, according to Joseph Ole Lenku, Kenya's secretary for the interior. He said more than 1,000 people were safely evacuated. Kenyan officials said there were still 10 or 15 attackers in the building Sunday evening, cornered in one location. Officials said at least one attacker died of his wounds after having been arrested. As the drama continued into the night, the Kenyan government started trying to soften the latest painful blow to East Africa's biggest economy. Nairobi is a hub for multinationals and nonprofit organizations doing business in Africa. Westgate mall is a crossroads of expatriate life in the city. It is also a stop for tourists en route to Kenya's safari parks and beaches. Kenya already has weathered several bouts of domestic turmoil this year. National elections in March passed without any of the ethnic violence that killed more than 1,000 people after the last contest in 2007. But the victor, Mr. Kenyatta, is set to go on trial at the International Criminal Court in November in a case involving alleged crimes against humanity related to ethnic violence during the 2007 election. He has said he is innocent. On top of that, much of Nairobi's international airport was destroyed in a fire last month. Its cause remains unknown as an investigation continues. So far, Kenya's economy has soldiered ahead. The International Monetary Fund forecast in April that gross domestic product would expand 5.8% this year, up from 4.7% in 2012. Kenya's finance ministry said this month that the country hopes to issue bonds worth at least $1.5 billion to foreign investors in November to fund ambitious infrastructure programs. But this weekend's strike at the heart of Kenya's cosmopolitan comforts is drawing a new cloud of uncertainty over a linchpin African economy. "The question is where does this leave the narrative about a Kenyan economy ready to take off," said Razia Khan, head of Africa research at London's Standard Chartered Bank. "You have this awful attack, destructive as possible in its aim—it's going to be a challenging time to be sure." —Idil Abshir in Nairobi, Karen Johnson in Ottawa and Patrick McGroarty in Johannesburg contributed to this article.

An Egyptian army soldier rests on his tank behind the gates of the presidential palace in Cairo on Saturday.
Associated Press CAIRO -- Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi
withdrew part of a controversial declaration that awarded him near absolute power, a limited concession to protesters whose two-week-long campaign had gridlocked Egyptian politics. But the new declaration preserves next Saturday as the date of a referendum on a divisive proposed constitution, skirting a key demand of Mr. Morsi's opponents. Selim Al Awa, a former presidential candidate and one of the lead negotiators between Mr. Morsi and his opponents, announced the new declaration in a news conference just past midnight on Sunday morning. Earlier In Cairo, a Hint of Compromise It still seemed unlikely that Mr. Morsi's partial climbdown would satisfy liberal-leaning politicians. Their opposition to Mr. Morsi and his Nov. 22 declaration set off the worst constitutional crisis to afflict Egyptian politics in decades. But it may ease tensions on the restive streets of Egypt's capital, where fighting between secularists and Islamists killed six people in the past week. Sunday morning's announcement preserves articles in Mr. Morsi's original declaration that replaced the Mubarak-appointed public prosecutors and allowed courts to retry former regime officials if new evidence becomes available. Many Egyptians blamed the public prosecutor for the light sentences handed down to the country's ousted leaders and police officers accused of corruption and killing protesters. Mr. Morsi's new declaration maintains the accelerated timeline for adopting Egypt's new constitution, defying his opponents' complaints that Saturday's referendum would railroad through an Islamist-tinged constitution. The concession marks only a mild sacrifice for Mr. Morsi, say the president's mostly liberal critics, because the power-expanding decree had already prevented Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court from dissolving the constitutional drafting committee. Mr. Morsi and his Islamist allies have said the court is stocked with former regime loyalists inimical to Egypt's democratic reforms. The court had been expected to rule on the legitimacy of the constitutional drafting committee last Sunday, but delayed the decision after Islamist protesters blocked the court's entryway. With the constitution drafted and its referendum date set, the founding document's passage is now nearly certain, said some secular-minded activists. "It was expected all along that he would do that at the last minute," said Bassem Sabry, a secular-leaning blogger and political analyst, of Mr. Morsi's decision. "After he got everything he wanted from the decree, he rescinded the decree and got some political points." But by withdrawing the most offensive articles in his Nov. 22 constitutional declaration, Mr. Morsi still exposes the 236-article document to the court's judgment. The courts now hold the reins of the unfolding crisis. If Egypt's SCC convenes and decides to block the new constitution and its referendum, it could send Egypt reeling once again toward fresh instability. In what could amount to an additional concession, Mr. Awa said Mr. Morsi would consider the opposition's suggestions for the proposed constitution. Mr. Awa offered few details on how much sway the opposition would have on the document, nor whether the president would reconvene the constitutional assembly to consider such changes. Mr. Morsi's constitutional declaration arrogated his authority over the judiciary, preventing them from challenging his decisions or dissolving the constitutional assembly. It also awarded the president vague powers to "take the necessary actions and measures to protect the country and the goals of the revolution." The presidential policy shift came hours after Mr. Morsi's leading critics refused to attend a day-long reconciliation meeting that Mr. Morsi had called for Saturday. Instead, only Mr. Morsi's like-minded Islamist colleagues and one pro-democracy activist attended the meeting at Mr. Morsi's besieged palace. The liberal leaders, which included several former secular-leaning presidential candidates, have insisted that dialogue was impossible until the president lifts a constitutional declaration that granted him almost unlimited political power. The timing of Mr. Morsi's decision could also reveal some pressure from Egypt's military, which tentatively waded into the conflict for the first time on Saturday. In a televised statement on Saturday afternoon, an unnamed military official admonished Mr. Morsi's opponents for ignoring the president's calls for dialogue and made ominous references to the military's "responsibility for maintaining the supreme interests of the nation." "Dialogue is the best and sole way to reach consensus that achieves the interests of the nation and the citizens," the spokesman said. "Anything other than that puts us in a dark tunnel with drastic consequences, which is something that we will not allow." Egypt's military, which for two years had been a constant presence in the country's political scene, has been largely absent from the two-week conflict. Their creeping re-entry to the political field come a day after Mr. Morsi showed signs of ceding to some of its opponents' demands after tens of thousands of activists thronged around the presidential palace on Friday in a deepening of the country's constitutional crisis. Opponents of Mr. Morsi—who have rallied angrily after the president gave himself extraordinary powers in a declaration late last month and placed himself above judiciary oversight—had demanded, among other things, that he defer plans to hold a Dec. 15 referendum on Egypt's freshly drafted constitution. These opponents say the document is an Islamist-tinged charter drafted by a body that was unfairly stacked with Morsi allies. Hemmed in by ultra-conservative supporters on one side and secularist revolutionary activists and Egypt's Christian minority on the other, Mr. Morsi is navigating a narrow political channel, said Khaled Fahmy, a political analyst and history professor at the American University in Cairo. He said the compromises like those offered Friday would make the president appear weak to his power base while failing to win over his opposition. "Something much more substantial needs to be done. The Brotherhood needs to realize that they cannot rule the country alone. They need partners," said Mr. Fahmy. Late Thursday evening, Mr. Morsi had appeared on television with an offer to meet with his opponents about withdrawing the article from last month's declaration that gave him extraordinary powers. The offer, which came just hours after tanks were deployed to disperse protesters from around the presidential palace, appeared to have done more to inflame anger against the president than to soothe it, according to some activists. Secular-leaning political leaders rejected the offer earlier Friday. Tens of thousands of Morsi opponents descended on the presidential palace in Cairo in protest. The crowds in front of the palace had thinned to only a few hundred by Saturday afternoon, with protesters and soldiers chatting amicably on sidewalks and sipping tea together at road-side stalls.

An Egyptian army soldier rests on his tank behind the gates of the presidential palace in Cairo on Saturday.
Associated Press CAIRO -- Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi
withdrew part of a controversial declaration that awarded him near absolute power, a limited concession to protesters whose two-week-long campaign had gridlocked Egyptian politics. But the new declaration preserves next Saturday as the date of a referendum on a divisive proposed constitution, skirting a key demand of Mr. Morsi's opponents. Selim Al Awa, a former presidential candidate and one of the lead negotiators between Mr. Morsi and his opponents, announced the new declaration in a news conference just past midnight on Sunday morning. Earlier In Cairo, a Hint of Compromise It still seemed unlikely that Mr. Morsi's partial climbdown would satisfy liberal-leaning politicians. Their opposition to Mr. Morsi and his Nov. 22 declaration set off the worst constitutional crisis to afflict Egyptian politics in decades. But it may ease tensions on the restive streets of Egypt's capital, where fighting between secularists and Islamists killed six people in the past week. Sunday morning's announcement preserves articles in Mr. Morsi's original declaration that replaced the Mubarak-appointed public prosecutors and allowed courts to retry former regime officials if new evidence becomes available. Many Egyptians blamed the public prosecutor for the light sentences handed down to the country's ousted leaders and police officers accused of corruption and killing protesters. Mr. Morsi's new declaration maintains the accelerated timeline for adopting Egypt's new constitution, defying his opponents' complaints that Saturday's referendum would railroad through an Islamist-tinged constitution. The concession marks only a mild sacrifice for Mr. Morsi, say the president's mostly liberal critics, because the power-expanding decree had already prevented Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court from dissolving the constitutional drafting committee. Mr. Morsi and his Islamist allies have said the court is stocked with former regime loyalists inimical to Egypt's democratic reforms. The court had been expected to rule on the legitimacy of the constitutional drafting committee last Sunday, but delayed the decision after Islamist protesters blocked the court's entryway. With the constitution drafted and its referendum date set, the founding document's passage is now nearly certain, said some secular-minded activists. "It was expected all along that he would do that at the last minute," said Bassem Sabry, a secular-leaning blogger and political analyst, of Mr. Morsi's decision. "After he got everything he wanted from the decree, he rescinded the decree and got some political points." But by withdrawing the most offensive articles in his Nov. 22 constitutional declaration, Mr. Morsi still exposes the 236-article document to the court's judgment. The courts now hold the reins of the unfolding crisis. If Egypt's SCC convenes and decides to block the new constitution and its referendum, it could send Egypt reeling once again toward fresh instability. In what could amount to an additional concession, Mr. Awa said Mr. Morsi would consider the opposition's suggestions for the proposed constitution. Mr. Awa offered few details on how much sway the opposition would have on the document, nor whether the president would reconvene the constitutional assembly to consider such changes. Mr. Morsi's constitutional declaration arrogated his authority over the judiciary, preventing them from challenging his decisions or dissolving the constitutional assembly. It also awarded the president vague powers to "take the necessary actions and measures to protect the country and the goals of the revolution."

Brazil's Vale To Take $4.2 Billion Charge
By
Jeff Fick
Dec. 20, 2012 5:46 p.m. ET
Brazil's Vale SA said Thursday it will take a $4.2 billion write-down on its nickel and aluminum investments, adding to a series of charges slated to hit the mining giant's fourth-quarter earnings. Vale's write-offs are part of a broader adjustment at the world's largest iron-ore miner as it slims down in a global economic slowdown that caused Vale's net profit to slide 66% year-on-year in the third quarter. The company has reined in...

Jesse Hagopian, with hand raised, and other Seattle teachers protested standardized exams Wednesday.
The Seattle Times/Associated Press Teachers at three Seattle schools are refusing to give students district-mandated standardized exams, one of the most dramatic moves in an escalating fight nationwide over using test scores to evaluate teachers and schools. The Seattle boycott, which began in one of the schools and spread in recent weeks, comes after the district decided to make the tests part of Seattle teachers' evaluations this year. But it follows long-standing complaints by the teachers that the computerized exams take up too much instructional time and force schools to close off computer labs for long stretches to administer the exams. "We've been raising our voices about this deeply flawed test for a long time," said Jesse Hagopian, who teaches history at Garfield High School, where teachers initiated the boycott by voting this month not to give the exam. But now that the district is using the test for evaluations, he said, "we've drawn our line in the sand." The spat in Seattle comes as districts nationwide wrestle with how best to use student test scores to rate teachers. In the past three years, more than 25 states have passed laws to link scores to teacher evaluations, because officials think it is a more effective way to gauge performance than traditional reliance on observations by school principals. But as local districts are trying to implement those policies, they are running into some resistance. New York City has forfeited hundreds of millions of state and federal dollars because union and city officials haven't agreed on a new evaluation system that would judge teachers, in part, on student test scores. The Los Angeles teachers union agreed earlier this month to use test scores in evaluations after a protracted fight with the district, and Chicago teachers staged a seven-day strike this past fall, in part, over efforts to judge them on students' test results. Jose Banda, superintendent of Seattle Public Schools, defended the use of testing to rate teachers. He said that student-achievement data is only one component of the district's teacher-evaluation system, which relies heavily on principal observations. "For us, it's just an added piece of the puzzle," he said. Tests have taken on increasing importance in U.S. education since the federal No Child Left Behind became law in 2002. Proponents, including the Obama administration, say assessments are necessary to ensure students are learning and that teachers' effectiveness is properly measured. Some parents and local officials also have resisted the spread of testing. In Texas and Florida, hundreds of school boards adopted resolutions last year asking state officials to reassess state-testing programs. Parents in Washington state and New York City have kept kids home from school on test day in protest. And school-district officials in Oklahoma complained recently about how test scores are factored into controversial new letter grades assigned to schools. Mr. Banda emphasized that the Seattle protests have happened at only a handful of the city's 95 schools. Some of the teachers boycotting the test there say they aren't opposed to using student-achievement data in evaluations but are unhappy with the current exam. The Seattle district requires teachers to give the math and reading Measures of Academic Progress exam, or MAP, to students in first through ninth grade two or three times a year. The exams are "computer adaptive," meaning questions begin at grade level but get tougher or easier based on how well the student does. District officials say the exam allows teachers to pinpoint each student's knowledge and adjust instruction. Seattle teachers complain the exam isn't linked to district or state learning standards. The district's new teacher evaluation system uses results from the MAP and state achievement exams to assign teacher ratings. A low rating triggers additional observations from the principal, who could eventually suggest termination. District officials said teachers can't be fired simply because of a low rating based on student test scores. Matt Carter, a teacher at Orca K-8 School in Seattle, has joined in the boycott because he thinks the MAP exam wastes his student's time and does not help guide his teaching. "If we are using a valid test and it is measuring what I am teaching, than I'd have no problem with it," he said. The district has warned teachers they could face 10 days suspension without pay if they don't administer the test. Pat Hunter, a principal at Maple Elementary in Seattle, said she supports using student-achievement results to guide instruction and as a "small piece" of the overall evaluation. "It's important to use test results, but it's also important that they not become your oxygen." Write to Stephanie Banchero at stephanie.banchero@wsj.com Email

KAMPALA, Uganda—Congolese rebels were granted another 48 hours to leave Goma, Uganda's military chief said Tuesday, despite their declaration that they wouldn't abide by a recent pullout agreement unless the Congolese government acceded to a series of political demands. Gen. Aronda Nyakairima said the commander of the so-called M23 rebels, Sultani Makenga, had agreed to withdraw his forces from Goma, located in the mineral-rich but...
