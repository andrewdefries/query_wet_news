   By Joseph Walker 
 An experimental drug being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN) and Sanofi SA (SNY) showed promising results during a small, mid-stage clinical trial in treating a subset of patients with moderate to severe asthma, but some physicians cautioned that it was too early to say how effective the treatment may ultimately be. The drug, dupilumab, is considered one of Regeneron's most promising pipeline drugs and could eventually reach $750 million in annual U.S. sales if it gains U.S. approval to treat asthma, according to Barclays. Regeneron and Sanofi, which have a partnership to co-develop certain experimental drug programs, are also testing the drug to treat a type of eczema, the itchy skin condition, and have said dupilumab could eventually be applied to other allergic conditions. Results from the trial, published online Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that dupilumab reduced asthma attacks by 87% in patients taking the drug compared to those receiving a placebo. Side effects of the drug appeared to be relatively consistent with those of patients taking placebos. "It really raises the possibility that we've hit upon a fundamental pathway that's driving the allergic reaction in asthma," said George D. Yancopoulos, Regeneron's chief scientific officer, in an interview. However, the trial was relatively small, enrolling 52 patients in each of the study's two treatment groups. An editorial accompanying the study results said the trial design, in which patients were gradually weaned off of standard therapies for asthma, did not reflect a "real world" environment. It's also unclear how large a swath of asthma patients will benefit from the drug, because only those with higher-than-normal disease-fighting white blood cells were admitted to the study, Michael E. Wechsler, director of the asthma program at National Jewish Health, a Denver-based research hospital that specializes in respiratory conditions, wrote in the editorial. Just 21% of patients screened for the trial met the inclusion criteria, Dr. Wechsler wrote. Asthma affects more than 24 million people in the U.S., but existing therapies are unable to control the condition for as many as 10% to 20% of patients, according to the study's authors. The drug will advance into a larger phase-two trial, which will have four to five times as many patients as the trial published Tuesday, said Regeneron's Mr. Yancopoulos. Shares of Regeneron fell $7.24, or 2.8%, to $256.40 in midday trading, while Sanofi shares added $1.05, or 1.9%, to $54.89. Write to Joseph Walker at Joseph.Walker@dowjones.com Email

U.S. Shipping Regulators Call Meeting With Europe, China Over P3 Tie-Up
Global Competitors Are Concerned Alliance Might Unfairly Squeeze Smaller Shippers
By
Costas Paris
Updated Nov. 19, 2013 12:03 p.m. ET
The U.S. Federal Maritime Commission has called for an unusual meeting with its European and Chinese counterparts to scrutinize the proposed alliance of the world's three biggest container-ship operators, amid concerns by global competitors that it might unfairly squeeze smaller shippers. The proposed tie-up among A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S of Denmark, CMA CGM of France and Mediterranean Shipping Co. of Switzerland would give the three European companies joint control of more than 40% of total sea-cargo capacity in some of...

Andrew Grossman in New York and Jack Nicas in Chicago
Updated Oct. 3, 2011 4:41 p.m. ET
Protestors at Occupy Wall Street's media area coordinated news updates on Sunday using laptop computers powered by a portable gas-powered generator.
Associated Press As anti-Wall Street protests spread from New York to other U.S. cities, the activists beginning their third week inside a Lower Manhattan park urged participants to dress up as "corporate zombies" on Monday. Organizers told the Associated Press that they would hold an anti-police brutality protest on the steps of City Hall, as well as a rally in support of union workers outside Sotheby's auction house on the Upper East Side. New York police arrested hundreds of demonstrators Saturday after a group blocked traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge. More Metropolis: For Protesters, Finding Food Is Easy N.Y. Politicians Pinched by Protest Downtown A Potluck Shabbat Amid the Protest Video: Occupy SF at Federal Reserve Bank Earlier: Hundreds Arrested on Brooklyn Bridge Over the weekend, budding copycat movements spread across the country, with smaller-scale protests planned via online social-networking sites. Protesters held sizable gatherings in Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles. In other cities, like San Francisco and Pittsburgh, protests were smaller or existed only in a planning stage. A website, occupytogether.org, lists groups that are offshoots of the New York protest. Activists have begun organizing outside the U.S., including in Prague, Melbourne and Montreal. A map of the country displayed in the Manhattan park held by demonstrators identified 21 places where other protests were organized. In New York, the protesters initially set out to occupy Wall Street but were rebuffed by police. Instead, the group set up in a nearby park, keeping the "Occupy Wall Street" moniker. The spread to other cities appears largely organic—the protests don't have a central organizer—and the idea came from a Canadian magazine and grew on social media websites. View Slideshow
A protester wakes up at Zuccotti Park Monday in New York City.
Spencer Platt/Getty Images Those protesting in New York have been circulating a list of grievances, most of which are aimed at corporations that they say are too powerful and often unethical. Among the complaints: bank executives received "exorbitant" bonuses not long after receiving taxpayer bailouts and companies have "poisoned the food supply through negligence" and "continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate better pay and safer working conditions." Many of the protesters are young. Joblessness seems to be a persistent theme. A blog that has become popular has pictures of people's faces next to stories of economic woe and messages of support for the protesters. "From 2006-2009 I owned a business with 12 employees," reads one, superimposed over a photo of a man and his young son, both smiling. "I closed my doors in 2009. I lost my home in 2010. I lived in my truck for six months. Now I rent a tiny room. I have no health insurance." Enlarge Image
In Boston, demonstrators on Sunday walk past the logistics tent in the Occupy Boston encampment across the street from the Federal Reserve building.
Associated Press It's unclear how long the protests will last, or whether they will take hold in the other cities on par with the New York protests. Like the initial stage of the New York protest, much of the activity in the offshoot cities is still taking place online on Facebook. Nathaniel Glosser,
a 46-year-old Pittsburgh writer, is helping organize what he calls "the Occupy Pittsburgh movement." Mr. Glosser, a veteran of anti-war marches, said he was inspired by what he saw in New York and started looking for people online who might do something like it in Pittsburgh. "After several days of searching on the Internet, I found that there were several hundred people who had signed up on the Facebook group and then I just jumped in with both feet," Mr. Glosser said. "Most of the people who started this have very little organizing experience." Mr. Glosser's group plans to meet at a Unitarian church on Wednesday and plans to hold its first rally on Oct. 15. In Los Angeles, hundreds marched on City Hall on Saturday on the first day of protests. In San Francisco, about two dozen people camped out Sunday afternoon outside the Federal Reserve branch. Some had tents. Others played guitars. Their posters said: "Arrest the fat cats." In Chicago, protesters occupied a narrow sidewalk outside the city's branch of the Federal Reserve Bank. They've been there around the clock for 10 consecutive days. At 3 p.m. Sunday, more than 100 gathered for an organizational meeting that was labeled the general assembly in which anyone can participate—a hallmark of the protests. Enlarge Image
A protester with a U.S. flag near Wall Street on Sunday, as the occupation of small park in Lower Manhattan entered its third week.
ZUMAPRESS.com Organizers shouted instructions through a small orange cone: No violence, be friendly to police, continue "the revolution." The protesters were diverse in race, gender, age and dress. Among the headwear in the crowd were beanies, ushankas, do-rags, fedoras, bandanas and one green helmet. Some wore boots, others were barefoot. Some offered handrolled cigarettes out of small vintage cases. Many gave their Twitter handle in addition to their name when introducing themselves. James Cox,
a 25-year-old waitress, discovered the movement on Twitter and showed up on the second day when there were just seven people. She has now slept on the sidewalk for a week and has become and organizer, keeping track of donated food and water. Protesters in Chicago are putting the New York group's grievances to a vote, amending some and adopting others as is. "We definitely stand in solidarity," said Mark Banks, a 30-year-old unemployed biochemist and Occupy Chicago spokesman. "But we're employing a very careful, inclusive process to make sure what they're trying to say is what we're trying to say." "We are part of a global and spreading movement," shouted Micah Philbrook,
a 33-year-old actor with shaggy white hair who serves a press liaison for the Occupy Chicago movement. To amplify the speakers' words, the crowd repeated each sentence. "I'm a semi-disabled 58 yr old granny with little or no transportation but whenever it is decided on date & place for OUR rally, I will do my darnedest to be there!" wrote a woman name Marilyn McCarty
on the Facebook page for a Birmingham, Ala., occupation, which does not yet have a set date or time. —The Associated Press and Geoffrey Fowler contributed to this article. Write to Andrew Grossman at andrew.grossman@wsj.com Email

The FTSE 100 kicked off the New Year in style, breaking through 6000 points on the first trading day of 2013 and finishing the week at its highest level since Feb. 8, 2011. And analysts expect the index's early year gains to continue. The analysts cite actions by central banks, improving economic conditions in the U.S. and China, and rising company profits for their bullish forecasts for the year. "In our view we need to get used to a FTSE above 6000 again and target 6575 for the end of 2013," analysts at Deutsche Bank

also expects a big rise, forecasting a year-end close of 6600 for the FTSE. The index finished last week at 6089.84, a 3.3% gain over the first three trading days of 2013. It is still down 12% from its record closing high of 6930.20, set on Dec. 30, 1999. "While the acceleration of growth will be modest," the expansion of central-bank balance sheets in developed markets "is likely to accelerate, especially in Japan and the euro area," Credit Suisse analyst Richard Kersley
said. "As a consequence, we believe that while headline inflation will be muted, inflation expectations will rise, which should benefit equities relative to bonds." However, while on the whole analysts expect the FTSE to rise in 2013, they also expect another volatile year. Gains in the first week of 2013 came after U.S. lawmakers struck a last-minute deal to prevent the implementation of spending cuts and tax increases that posed a threat to the U.S. economy. But the issue, which had weighed on the FTSE and other markets toward the end of 2012, isn't entirely resolved. The U.S. government still has to wrestle with the country's deficit and its looming debt ceiling. The health of the euro-zone economy could also still worry investors, although fears that Greece could leave the bloc have diminished over the past year. The country was recently given its second tranche of its international aid following a successful debt buyback. Against this backdrop, Charles Stanley technical analyst Bill McNamara
expects the FTSE to end 2013 at around 6375. He is less optimistic about the outlook for the first quarter, when he expects investors to react to overbought conditions by taking some profits. Mr. McNamara also believes a deal on the U.S. debt ceiling is unlikely to materialize quickly, resulting in more uncertainty and little prospect for a market rally in the near term. "Nevertheless, the outlook for the year as a whole is positive and it is our expectation that improving conditions in the U.S. and China will ensure the FTSE makes decent headway," he said. Guy Foster,
a strategist at Brewin Dolphin, is a bit more modest in his outlook, given the uncertainty over what might happen in Washington. He cited a year-end forecast of 6350 for the FTSE. "We still expect markets to reflect earnings growth of around 9% with no re-rating, while these political uncertainties weigh," he said. Write to Michele Maatouk at michele.maatouk@dowjones.com Email

Agriculture, in the current legislation, is exempt from emission caps, a win for farmers and ranchers afraid they'd have to figure out how to regulate emissions from, among other things, their manure lagoons, tractors and their cows, which emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Still, the farm lobby isn't satisfied. Farmers say the overall costs of climate-change regulation will trickle down to the farm through higher costs of supplies, animals, equipment and other agricultural goods. As a result, farm groups wanted to see specific mechanisms that would let farmers earn revenue from the system. For example, they wanted to be able to earn credits for the carbon absorbed by their crops. Those credits could then be sold to others who need them to cover emissions. The current legislation doesn't include any specific language on such agriculture offsets. The bill "utterly ignores the principles we have identified as critical to U.S. agriculture," Bob Stallman, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, wrote in a letter to members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The National Corn Growers Association said that "without the opportunity to generate revenue from greenhouse gas reductions, our growers will be unable to bear the burden of increased prices for diesel, fertilizer, steel, electricity and all other inputs necessary to provide feed, fiber and fuel for the world." The agriculture industry is also disappointed the bill doesn't compensate farmers who find it harder to compete in global markets due to higher costs. Rick Krause, senior director of congressional relations at the American Farm Bureau Federation, said certain industries do receive some allowances and that agriculture should be included as well. Complicating matters in farm country is the role of corn-based ethanol in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a separate controversy playing out at the Environmental Protection Agency. Rep. Collin Peterson, a Democrat from Minnesota and the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, was quoted recently saying that he would "bring this climate bill down" if the administration doesn't work to ensure ethanol has a prominent role in any program aimed at reducing greenhouse gases.
