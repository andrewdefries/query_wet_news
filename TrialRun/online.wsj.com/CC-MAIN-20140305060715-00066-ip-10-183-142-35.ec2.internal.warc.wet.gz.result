customers will have an easier time of it next week, when the burger giant's restaurant and drive-thru menu boards across the country will show that the Big Mac, at 550 calories, is 200 calories leaner than the other burger. But other choices won't be so clear-cut, like the Double Cheeseburger with 440 calories or the Southwest Salad with Crispy Chicken, which weighs in at 450. McDonald's highest-calorie item isn't a burger at all, but the 1,150-calorie Big breakfast with hotcakes and large biscuit. And the healthy-sounding 22-ounce mango pineapple smoothie matches the 350 calories in the grilled chicken sandwich. On the Menu Calorie counts and other nutritional information for popular McDonald's menu items.

and Au Bon Pain, already post calories on their menus, but McDonald's is the largest chain and the first fast-food company to do so on a national level. The push is part of an effort to get out ahead of federal menu-labeling requirements. There is a market need to it too—McDonald's want to convey to customers that its not just selling junk food. The company last year added apples to all of its kids' meals and made the servings of fries smaller. Enlarge Image
Some regional studies suggest that having nutritional information available when ordering a meal prompts people to buy healthier items. Other studies have found no such change in consumer behavior. But considering how prominent restaurants have become in the American diet, any change could have an effect on obesity rates. Americans now consume roughly a third of their calories from restaurants, up from less than a quarter in the 1970s, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And people spend about half of their food budgets at restaurants now, compared to a third in the 1970s. A Stanford Graduate School of Business study found that when Starbucks Corp.

began posting calorie information in its New York City stores in April 2008, as required by city law, customers ordered items containing 6% fewer calories on average per transaction. "If we see a similar effect from other chains you'd see about a 30-calorie per person per day decrease," said Margo Wootan,
director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. "The thing about obesity is it's caused by a slow, steady creep in people's weight over decades. For most of us, we're gaining one to two pounds per year steadily over decades and end up being 30 to 50 pounds overweight. The obesity epidemic is explained by about 100 extra calories per person per day, so if we get a daily 30-calorie decrease from menu labeling, that's huge." Shortly after Panera Bread posted calorie counts on its menu boards in April 2010, the company noticed that 20% of customers began ordering lower-calorie items. "We think it's an important ingredient in respecting our customers and treating them as intelligent people who can make smart choices for themselves," Panera founder and co-CEO Ron Shaich
said in an interview. But some caution that consumers in large numbers may not be swayed by the extra information. A report published last year in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, which reviewed seven studies on the topic, found that "calorie labeling does not have the intended effect of decreasing calorie purchasing or consumption." Even McDonald's hasn't yet noticed a comprehensive change in behavior in the cities and states that have already mandated calorie counts to be posted. "It hasn't seemed to have made a difference, but what it says to the customer is, 'We care about you and want to provide you with the most detailed information possible,' " McDonald's USA president Jan Fields
said in an interview. New regulations requiring operators of restaurants with 20 or more outlets to post calories on menus are expected to take effect by the end of next year. Even if consumers aren't quick to change their buying habits, restaurants, in anticipation of the coming regulation, are doing the work for them. Numerous chains have either reformulated menu items to be healthier or have started steering consumers to lower-calorie choices. A study published last month in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found that 26% of entrees at 37 restaurant chains studied in King County, Washington, had reduced calories 18 months after a menu-labeling law took effect there.

has a menu featuring items under 550 calories, and McDonald's recently grouped several menu items under the heading "Favorites Under 400 Calories." Glenn Kikuchi,
owner of 10 McDonald's franchises in Maryland, said he's already seen signs that the highlighted calorie counts are having an effect. "I see that a lot of the moms are looking at it, but also, curiously enough, the teenagers are looking at it, too," Mr. Kikuchi said.

CHICAGO—Wall Street's main cop, under the new leadership of a former prosecutor, plans to ramp up its policing of financial fraud. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White, laying out a broad enforcement agenda for the first time since taking the helm at the agency five months ago, said the agency will seek charges against more individuals and pursue larger fines against companies that commit wrongdoing....

By

Updated Oct. 23, 2012 1:26 p.m. ET
RadioShackCorp. posted its third consecutive quarter of losses as the electronics retailer's efforts to revive its business by selling smartphones continued to backfire.

Tim Geithner
March 1, 2012 7:19 p.m. ET
Four years ago, on an evening in March 2008, I received a call from the CEO of Bear Stearns informing me that they planned to file for bankruptcy in the morning. Bear Stearns was the smallest of the major Wall Street institutions, but it was deeply entwined in financial markets and had the perfect mix of vulnerabilities. It took on too much risk. It relied on billions of dollars of risky short-term financing. And it held thousands of derivative contracts with thousands of companies. These weaknesses made Bear Stearns the most important initial casualty in what would become the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But as we saw in the summer and fall of 2008, these weaknesses were not unique to that firm. In the spring of 2008, more Americans were starting to face higher mortgage payments as teaser interest rates reset and they could no longer refinance out of them because the value of their homes stopped rising—the leading edge of a wave of foreclosures and a terrible fall in house prices. By the time Bear Stearns failed, the recession was then already several months old, but it would of course get much worse in coming months. These problems were partly the result of amnesia. There was no memory of extreme crisis, no memory of what can happen when a nation allows huge amounts of risk to build up outside of the safeguards all economies require. When the CEO of Bear Stearns called that night, it was not because I was his firm's supervisor or regulator, but because I was then the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which serves as the fire department for the financial system. The financial safeguards in the law at that moment were tragically antiquated and weak. Neither the Fed, nor any other federal agency, had the necessary comprehensive authority over investment firms like Bear Stearns, insurance companies like AIG, or the government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Regulators did not have the authority they needed to oversee and impose prudent limits on overall risk and leverage on large nonbank financial institutions. And they had no authority to put these firms, or bank holding companies, through a managed bankruptcy that wound them down in an orderly way or to otherwise adequately contain the damage caused by their failure. The safeguards on banks were much tougher than those applied to any other part of the financial system, but even those provisions were not conservative enough. A large shadow banking system had developed without meaningful regulation, using trillions of dollars in short-term debt to fund inherently risky financial activity. The derivatives markets grew to more than $600 trillion, with little transparency or oversight. Household debt rose to an alarming 130% of income, with a huge portion of those loans originated with little to no supervision and poor consumer protections. Enlarge Image
Chad Crowe The failure to modernize the financial oversight system sooner is the most important reason why this crisis was more severe than any since the Great Depression, and why it was so hard to put out the fires of the crisis. The failure to reform sooner is why the crisis caused gross domestic product to fall at an annual rate of 9% in the last quarter of 2008; why millions of Americans lost their jobs, homes, businesses and savings; why the housing market is still so far from recovery; and why our national debt has grown so significantly. For all these reasons, President Obama asked Congress to pass tough reforms quickly, before the memory of the crisis faded. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by the president on July 21, 2010, put in place safer and more modern rules of the road for the financial industry. Yet only four years after the financial crisis began to unfold, some people seem to be suffering from amnesia about how close America came to complete financial collapse under the outdated regulatory system we had before Wall Street reform. Remember the crisis when you hear complaints about financial reform—complaints about limits on risk-taking or requirements for transparency and disclosure. Remember the crisis when you read about the hundreds of millions of dollars now being spent on lobbyists trying to weaken or repeal financial reform. Remember the crisis when you recall the dozens of editorials and columns against reform published on the opinion pages of this newspaper over the past three years. Are the costs of reform too high? Certainly not relative to the costs of another financial crisis. Credit is relatively inexpensive and growing across most of the U.S. financial system, although it is still tight for some borrowers. If the costs of reform were a material drag on credit growth, then loans to businesses would not have grown faster than the overall economy since the law passed and its implementation began. Are these reforms complex? No more complex than the problems they are designed to solve. And, it should be noted, most of the length and complexity in the rules is the result of the care required to target safeguards where they are needed, not where they would have a damaging effect. Is there some risk that these reforms will go too far with unintended consequences? That depends on the quality of judgment of regulators in the coming months as they flesh out the remaining reforms. But our system provides considerable protection against that risk, with the rules subject to long periods of public comment and analysis and with room in the law to get the balance right. The greater error would be for Congress or the regulators, under tremendous pressure from lobbyists, to once again exempt large swaths of the financial industry from rules against abuse. These reforms are not perfect, and they will not prevent all future financial crises. But if these reforms had been in place a decade ago, then the rise in debt and leverage would have been less dangerous, consumers would not have been nearly as vulnerable to predation and abuse, and the government would have been able to limit the damage that a financial crisis could have on the broader economy. President Obama, along with Sen. Chris Dodd and Rep. Barney Frank, deserves enormous credit for pushing for tough reforms quickly. My wife occasionally looks up from the newspaper with bewilderment while reading another story about people in the financial world or their lobbyists complaining about Wall Street reform or claiming they didn't need the Troubled Asset Relief Program. She reminds me of the panicked calls she answered for me at home late at night or early in the morning in 2008 from the then-giants of our financial system. We cannot afford to forget the lessons of the crisis and the damage it caused to millions of Americans. Amnesia is what causes financial crises. These reforms are worth fighting to preserve. Mr. Geithner is secretary of the U.S. Treasury. Email

Americans Killed in Afghan Suicide Attacks
By
Nathan Hodge and Habib Khan Totakhil Updated April 7, 2013 5:06 a.m. ET
KABUL—A Taliban assassination attempt on the governor of Afghanistan's southern Zabul province Saturday failed to kill its target but caused several American and Afghan casualties, including a 25-year-old U.S. diplomat, U.S. and Afghan officials said. The State Department said that four other diplomats were injured, one critically. The U.S.-led military coalition said three service members and two coalition civilians died in the attack.

Egyptian Shares Plunge After Morsi's Move
By
Tim Falconer
Updated Nov. 25, 2012 9:05 a.m. ET
DUBAI—Egyptian share prices took the steepest plunge in over a year Sunday as renewed protests, sparked by President Mohammed Morsi's decision to grant himself sweeping new powers, unnerved investors already jittery about the prospects for the country's economy. Divisions in Egypt have deepened over the past few days as thousands of people have mounted competing demonstrations backing and opposing Mr. Morsi's controversial decrees,...

Chile Manages Strong Growth

Nov. 19, 2012 5:40 p.m. ET
SANTIAGO, Chile—Robust domestic demand and investment continued to fuel Chile's soaring economy in the third quarter, helping it withstand a global slowdown weighing on most of Latin America's other major countries. Only neighboring Peru, which like Chile has pursued market-friendly economic policies and boasts solid fiscal and external accounts, has been outperforming Chile. Both countries benefit from fast-rising consumer spending...

One vaccine combines molecules of cocaine with a harmless piece of cholera, prompting an immune response to both.
Brian Stauffer I met Shirelle as she entered treatment for cocaine addiction at the height of the crack epidemic in the 1980s. An ancient-looking African-American woman who was in fact in her late 30s, she met my gaze with a look that I had seen all over the blighted neighborhoods of Detroit: a disturbing combination of twitchy facial movements and inert, vacant eyes. Feeling ashamed and suicidal about how her addiction was destroying her family, she had entered treatment—out of desperation, not with any confidence that it would help her. Shirelle had already been through rehab, counseling and 12-step meetings, to no avail. She spoke slowly because her lips were badly burned from her crack pipe, but her direct question was easily understood: "Isn't there anything else?" "Not really," I responded. As an expert in addiction treatment, what depresses me is that a quarter-century later, I would still have to give her the same answer. But another possibility is now on the horizon: a vaccine for addiction to cocaine and other stimulant drugs. The idea of using the body's immune system to combat the effects of addictive drugs goes back to animal studies conducted in the early 1970s, but the first evidence that a vaccine could help people with cocaine addiction didn't emerge until 2009. In a groundbreaking clinical trial, Thomas Kosten of Baylor College of Medicine and his colleagues tested a vaccine that combines molecules of cocaine with a harmless component of cholera. Sensing what appears to be an emerging infection, the body generates an immune response to the cholera that extends to the cocaine. At the end of the trial, patients whose bodies generated a strong immune response to the vaccine had almost 30% more cocaine-free drug tests than did patients who generated a weak response or who received a placebo. What would such a vaccine mean to a cocaine addict like Shirelle? Her body would treat the drug like an invading germ and produce antibodies that bind to it and change its size and shape. The cocaine she ingested, which once would have crossed into her brain rapidly and en masse, would get there slowly, if at all. In colloquial terms, cocaine would be no fun for her anymore. The theory, which Dr. Kosten's study went some way to support, is that when cocaine addicts no longer get a euphoric rush from the drug, they will stop using it. Treating addiction with a vaccine strikes most people, including many of my colleagues in the field, as radical. For other addictions (to nicotine, alcohol and opiates like heroin) the approach has been very different: The pharmacologic breakthroughs have come from medications that alter neurochemistry to reduce cravings or block the rewarding effects of drugs at particular receptors in the brain. Billions of dollars have been spent trying to develop similar medications for cocaine and methamphetamine addiction, but the results have been disappointing. A vaccine to combat addiction to these drugs would work as soon as the drug enters the body, before it has a chance to exert its powerful effects in the brain. A vaccine would not be a magic bullet; it couldn't stand on its own as a solution to cocaine and methamphetamine addiction. Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and 12-step groups have been shown to reduce stimulant drug use in rigorous research studies. Another approach using small, prompt rewards contingent on stopping drug use—rewards like meal vouchers and movie tickets—has been shown to be effective both in health-care settings and in the criminal justice system. But like everyone else in the addiction treatment field, I know that these approaches aren't always helpful and might become more effective if combined with a medical approach. There are a number of discouraging facts, however. In Dr. Kosten's study, only 38% of patients injected with the vaccine developed a strong immune response. The rest developed a weak response or none at all, for unknown reasons. Even when the vaccine did work, the effects faded over time, requiring re-injection every few weeks. And not everyone will be willing to try the vaccine, for the very reason that it is so promising: It makes drug use less enjoyable without immediately reducing the physical and psychological craving for the drug. Future vaccines may not have to depend on the uncertainties of each patient's body to generate a strong immune response. S. Michael Owens of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences has synthesized antibodies to methamphetamine that can be infused into addicted patients. So rather than waiting to see if a patient's body will produce its own antibodies, as in Dr. Kosten's study, Dr. Owens notes that with this approach "we can give you enough antibody and we can do it fast and at the right dose, just like any other medication." The problem of immune response fading over time may also be solved one day. Theoretically, future vaccines could use a virus to deliver genetic material that reprograms liver cells to consistently produce antibodies to stimulant drugs. Shankar Vallabhajosula of Weill Cornell Medical Colleague recently used brain scans to demonstrate that such a gene-therapy vaccine blocked cocaine from entering the brain of monkeys as long as four months after injection. A trial in humans is planned. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to developing a vaccine is funding. Nora Volkow, the director of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse, says she is "very excited by the possibilities of vaccines." But the entire $1 billion annual budget of her grant-giving agency is barely equal to what the pharmaceutical industry spends to bring a single medication to market. The big money for research and development is in the private sector, which has shown little interest in addiction vaccines. The pharmaceutical industry knows that for an addiction vaccine to be profitable, large numbers of clinicians have to prescribe it. But only some 3,500 physicians in the U.S. specialize full-time in addiction, as compared with a population of about 21 million Americans with diagnosable drug and alcohol problems. A significant portion of physicians don't see addiction as a legitimate medical condition and therefore aren't interested in treating it. Others look at the high failure rate of addiction treatment and instinctively recoil: Physicians hate failure even more than they hate managed-care executives. Early in my career, depression was often seen as a sign of weak character that doctors were helpless to affect. Then came the Prozac revolution. When doctors and patients saw that depression responds to a medication, they came to view the condition more as an illness than as a character defect. If vaccine researchers can give doctors an effective medical treatment for stimulant drug addiction, a similar virtuous cycle could begin. The existence of a medication would legitimize cocaine and methamphetamine addiction as medical disorders, which in turn would make doctors more comfortable treating the addiction of patients like Shirelle. Only then would the pharmaceutical industry make the investments that will be required for the rapid development of this potentially lifesaving technology. —Dr. Humphreys is a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University and a former senior policy adviser in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.
