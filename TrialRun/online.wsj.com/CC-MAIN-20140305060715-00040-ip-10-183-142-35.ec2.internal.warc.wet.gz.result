--Comex December gold ends down 1.1% at $1,243.60/oz --Steady producer prices and slower layoffs fan worries the Fed will soon cut stimulus --Brighter economic data bolster the Fed's view of steady growth 
 
   By Matt Day and Tatyana Shumsky 
 NEW YORK--Gold sank to a new four-month low Thursday as signs that the U.S. economy continues to improve triggered a new wave of selling among investors. Gold for December delivery, the most actively traded contract, fell $14.40, or 1.1%, to $1,243.60 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. This was the lowest settlement price since July 8, when gold ended floor trading at $1,234.90 an ounce. Gold futures have drummed a retreat in recent days amid fears over the likely course of U.S. monetary policy. On Wednesday, prices dropped after minutes from the latest Federal Reserve policy meeting showed officials considered ending monetary stimulus efforts "in coming months." In the years following the financial crisis, many investors gravitated toward gold because they believed the Fed's extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy--aimed at kickstarting growth in the U.S. economy--would stoke inflation or weaken the dollar. Investors often hold gold as a hedge against rising consumer prices or depreciating currencies. But to the disappointment of those gold bulls, inflation hasn't materialized even though the Fed is in its third round of bond purchases, a policy that essentially injects money into the economy. Currently, the Fed buys $85 billion worth of bonds every month. "People are finding it hard to find a reason to own gold," said Adam Klopfenstein, a senior market strategist with Archer Financial Services. "Demand for gold as a store of value is not going to be there when inflation is low." If the Fed scales back, or "tapers," its bond-buying program soon, that will further reduce the chances of inflation cropping up in the future, analysts say, and further diminish the argument to buy gold. "Gold is losing one of the only things that's been keeping some investors interested: the tapering-delay discussion," Mr. Klopfenstein said. The recent Fed signals, combined with subdued inflation, make it even less likely that gold will be able to recoup this year's massive losses. Year to date, gold is down 26%, on track to post its biggest loss since 1981. That year, gold fell 33%. If gold ends the year in the red, it will mark the end of gold's bull run--12 years of consecutive gains. Still, some market watchers say there are a raft of potential events that could spark a year-end rally. Escalation of conflicts in the Middle East could lift demand for the metal as a haven investment, analysts say, as could a sudden turnaround in roaring U.S. equity markets. David Einhorn, founder and president of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday that he holds gold in case "things go haywire." Gold is widely considered a store of value and a hedge against financial and political instability. Gold hit its lows early Thursday after the Labor Department said its producer-price index, a measure of how much companies pay for goods, fell 0.2% in October from the previous month. The data, following a report on Wednesday that showed consumer prices rising at the slowest pace in four years, is the latest evidence that inflation remains largely in check. A separate report on Thursday showed another drop in new claims for U.S. unemployment benefits last week. Further strength in the labor market could bolster the case for the Fed to throttle back its bond purchases. "Tapering is coming at some stage," said David Govett, head of precious metals at brokerage Marex Spectron in London. "The precious metals markets are out of favor with investors and set to stay that way."

Elderly Koreans from each side of the border meet for the first–and possibly last–time since 1950s in the first reunion of families since 2010. The WSJ's Alastair Gale talks about the politics behind these rare meetings.
SOKCHO, South Korea—Elderly Koreans from each side of the peninsula's heavily armed border wrapped their arms around relatives not seen since the 1950s in the first reunion of families divided by the Korean War in over three years. At the gathering at the North Korean resort of Mount Kumgang, many were overcome with emotion. Some yelled each other's names as they met and many broke into tears. "I thought we'd never see this day," said Choe Yong Chol,
a North Korean reunited with his brother from the South, after an embrace that lasted over a minute. Tearful Reunions
View Slideshow
South Korean Lee Young-sill, right, 87, meets with her North Korean sister Lee Jung Sill, left, 84.
European Pressphoto Agency The meetings, which run through Tuesday, are a tangible evidence of a recent tentative thawing of ties between Pyongyang and Seoul. Since the first reunion in 1985, the event has taken place during upturns in bilateral relations. But when North Korea shelled a South Korean border island and killed four people in 2010, the meetings were halted. Plans for the latest round have been on-and-off for months. After North Korea canceled the event in September at the last minute, the two sides began discussing reviving the meetings in late January. Despite reaching an agreement, North Korea again threatened to scrap the event because of military drills in South Korea. Last week, North Korea dropped its objections and the two sides confirmed the plan would go ahead. The reunions serve as a reminder that the division of the peninsula after 1950-1953 Korean War also separates blood relatives. Thousands have met through the project but over 70,000 people in the South are waiting for their turn, with spaces decided by computerized lottery. For most, the meetings are not only a chance to reunite but also to bid a final farewell. Relatives are removed from the lottery for future reunions after taking part in the event, and cross-border communications are forbidden by both governments. South Korean Heo Kyung-ok, right, 86, waves from a bus heading to North Korea's Mount Kumgang resort to meet her family members, in Sokcho, Gangwon Province, South Korea.
Yonhap/European Pressphoto Agency Most South Koreans brought gifts for their relatives Thursday, though United Nations sanctions on North Korea prevent expensive items. Hand-wound mechanical watches—rather than battery-powered ones—were recommended. Materials that criticize the North's regime were also banned. Under the watchful gaze of North Korean minders and media, some relatives appeared to find it difficult to connect freely. North Koreans are thought to receive strict guidance on how to behave and what they can say at these meetings. "Thanks to the Marshal [
Kim Jong Un
], we can meet again," said Mr. Choe, a former South Korean fisherman abducted by the North while at sea about 40 years ago. "Both sides should stop engaging in slander and achieve reunification," said Mr. Choe, echoing North Korea's recent calls to South Korea. Later he explained to his brother how well his family and neighbors treat him. Soon minders told reporters to move to another table. South Korean Park Yang-Gon, left, meets with his North Korean brother Park Yang-Soo during a family reunion Feb. 20 in Mount Kumgang, North Korea. The two hadn't seen each other since the 1970s. Getty Images The first group of 82 South Korean citizens, as well as some of their accompanying family members, will remain in North Korea until Saturday. Then a new group will travel up for a second stage of the event. Of those who traveled Thursday, 19 were in wheelchairs and two were taken in ambulances. Choi Byeong-gwan,
67, traveled to meet a stepbrother and stepsister from North Korea. His father was abducted by the North during the war. The stepbrother handed him a photo of their father's new family, consisting of seven children and a new wife. As they shared stories about their late father, the three joined in a hug. "I reckon [Dad] was less lonely with this new family," said Mr. Choi. For some, the meeting came too late. Lee Young-sil,
87, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, couldn't recognize her sister. "It's me. Why can't you hear me?" said her sister, crying. Ms. Lee's daughter told the aunt she met for the first time that her mother insisted on coming despite ill health. Write to Jeyup S. Kwaak at jeyup.kwaak@wsj.com Email

Sales of vacation homes are picking up as low prices pull buyers off the fence. But with travel costs rising and consumers still uncertain about the economy, many buyers are snapping up properties closer to home. Shown, houses on White Horse Beach in Plymouth, Mass.

The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to revisit affirmative action in state-college admissions. Jess Bravin has details on The News Hub. Photo: AP
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to revisit affirmative action in state-college admissions, suggesting a 2003 ruling that narrowly permitted race-conscious policies in public higher education may face tough scrutiny from today's more conservative court. The case, which comes from the University of Texas at Austin, joins a docket already crowded with major issues, most prominently President Barack Obama's 2010 health-care overhaul, whose constitutionality will be argued next month. The race-conscious admissions policy at the University of Texas at Austin will come before Supreme Court justices.
Associated Press The justices are also reviewing an immigration law from Arizona and the Environmental Protection Agency's power to enforce the Clean Water Act. As early as next October's term, they could review the state or federal government's power to deny recognition to same-sex marriages, as well as the validity of Voting Rights Act provisions enacted during the civil rights era. The University of Texas said it based its admissions policy on the 2003 precedent, Grutter v. Bollinger. In that case, involving the University of Michigan Law School, the court by a 5-4 vote held for the first time that racial diversity in higher education qualified as a compelling governmental interest. Such a state interest is essential when a government classifies individuals by race. The UT policy includes consideration of race as part of a "holistic" evaluation of applicants who didn't qualify for admission through either superior academic performance or a plan that grants admission to the top 10% of graduates from each Texas high school. The policy was challenged by lead plaintiff Abigail Fisher, who was denied admission to the university after applying in 2008. Enlarge Image

Journal Community The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans agreed with the university, as did the trial judge in Austin, whose ruling observed that "as long as Grutter remains good law, UT's current admissions program remains constitutional." But Grutter's longevity has been in doubt since its author, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, was succeeded by Justice Samuel Alito, who joined the court's four other conservatives in a 2007 ruling that forbade public-school districts from promoting diversity through race-conscious pupil-assignment plans. Both sides view the current case, Fisher v. Texas, as a vehicle through which the high court could narrow or even overrule Justice O'Connor's opinion. The university urged the justices to avoid the case, seizing on what it said were procedural flaws. Among other factors, UT argued that the claim was moot because both Ms. Fisher and her co-plaintiff had since attended or graduated from other schools. Aside from abolishing the policy, Ms. Fisher has asked for only $100 in damages—her application fee and housing deposit. Likewise, the Obama administration fought to squelch the case in the lower courts, taking the unusual step of filing a brief on the university's side at the Fifth Circuit. The "university's effort to promote diversity is a paramount government objective," that brief said. "The question is not whether an individual belongs to a racial group, but rather how an individual's membership in any group may provide deeper understanding of the person's record and experiences, as well as the contribution she can make to the school." U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito.
Agence France Presse/Getty Images Justice Elena Kagan, solicitor general when the Obama administration filed that brief, recused herself from the Fisher case, which is expected to be heard in the high court's 2012-13 term, beginning in October. "I hope the [Supreme] Court will decide that all future UT applicants will be allowed to compete for admission without their race or ethnicity being a factor," Ms. Fisher said in a statement issued by the Project on Fair Representation, a Washington-based foundation that opposes race-conscious government actions and has underwritten her suit. UT President William Powers said in a statement the school is committed to its admissions policy and will seek a decision reaffirming the educational benefits of diversity. Enlarge Image
UT President William Powers has defended the policy.
Associated Press Texas has a rocky history of race in admissions. The state once enforced official segregation, and it took a 1950 Supreme Court ruling before the University of Texas would admit blacks to its law and graduate schools. In more-recent decades, the state relied on affirmative action to boost minority enrollment, only to have that struck down by the Fifth Circuit in a 1996 decision, Hopwood v. Texas. The decision rolled back affirmative action in public universities within the Fifth Circuit's jurisdiction of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. To stem a decline in minority students, UT adopted the policy to admit the top 10% of graduates from each Texas high school, ensuring students from heavily black or Hispanic campuses could enroll. After Grutter nullified the Hopwood ruling, UT reinstated consideration of race. Black enrollment doubled to 6%, and Hispanic enrollment rose to 20% from 13%, according to the district-court opinion.

A federal jury in Texas sided Thursday with Cisco Systems Inc. in a patent-infringement case brought by VirnetX Holding Corp., sending shares of the patent-holding company down 28%.

Business schools are exploring a new service: matchmaking. After relying for years on assembly line-like interview schedules, career-services offices at some top schools are taking a personalized approach to the student job hunt. Some are beefing up one-on-one advising sessions to help students define career goals, while others are making individual introductions to alumni or sending job postings to student clubs. Enlarge Image
Lisa Haney The new tack comes as M.B.A.s consider careers in industries like technology and clean energy, where companies tend to hire one or two students at a time, rather than in large numbers like at finance and consulting firms, traditional B-school employers. "There's been a complete upending of the model," says Pulin Sanghvi,
assistant dean and director of the Career Management Center at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He reorganized the 16-person office last year to strengthen individual advising, alumni relations and connections with new employers, particularly private-equity firms, hedge funds and technology startups. Around 80% of the companies that hired Stanford M.B.A.s last year took just one student; only 16 hired four or more. This spring, Stanford will hold its second networking event featuring representatives from companies with fewer than 300 employees. Many don't even have open positions, Mr. Sanghvi says, but at minimum it allows students and firms to get acquainted, so that when a job becomes available, the firm already has a student in mind. Meanwhile, for the past three years Stanford students could opt to join a database that tracks their ideal industries and geographies, as well as academic credentials and work experience. With student preferences in hand, the school seeks out companies that could be a match, a process Mr. Sanghvi likens to a feature on Amazon.com Inc.

's site that recommends items similar to the one a shopper is already considering purchasing. To be sure, schools aren't walking students all the way down to the altar, so to speak. Most efforts are aimed at introducing students to potential employers, then leaving those students to build the relationships themselves. Vidya Vasu-Devan,
a 2012 Stanford graduate, indicated on a questionnaire early in her first year there that she wanted the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to come recruit at the school. Stanford invited the philanthropy for a meeting in spring 2011, and the school became one of just two feeders for the foundation's new summer internship program. Ms. Vasu-Devan, 28 years old, spent her summer there and joined the group's program-related investments arm full-time after graduation last year. That referral service can work both ways. Some companies with very specific criteria—say, Russian fluency and a background in quantitative finance—might ask a school to suggest students with those qualifications, rather than broadcasting an opening to all students. Fred Staudmyer,
assistant dean for career management at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, has been spending more time contacting specific student groups with such requests. "It's much more blocking and tackling than it used to be," Mr. Staudmyer says of the process. London Business School's effort will kick into high gear in coming weeks, when every student without a job offer is assigned a career-services adviser. Those staffers hold weekly conferences to brainstorm leads, and send out packets of specialized résumés for students with niche interests, such as private equity in India. It seems subjective—students who curry favor with career staffers may get the plum opportunities—but schools insist they don't play favorites. Fiona Sandford,
executive director of career services at LBS, says that while she will match students to a company's criteria, she won't recommend a student based on her own impressions. Having observed the mass-hiring approach at his own alma mater, University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Ryan Frankel,
chief executive of New York translation company VerbalizeIt Inc., vowed to keep his own prospecting very targeted. Mr. Frankel recently reached out to student clubs and faculty at three top B-schools, as he looks to add two or three new M.B.A.s to his 10-person team. "We want to be more refined in the matchmaking," Mr. Frankel says. "Culture really matters" in such a small company, and the tailored approach weeds out those who wouldn't be a good fit.

Christopher Rhoads and Leslie Scism Updated Nov. 16, 2012 10:35 p.m. ET
Superstorm Sandy buried the coastal town of Sea Bright, N.J. in sand and devastated its business district and scores of homes. Now the residents are trying to decide: Will they rebuild? WSJ's Christopher Rhoads reports.
SEA BRIGHT, N.J.—A week after Sandy buried this coastal town in six feet of sand, a bus took residents to view the remains. Small talk quickly turned to shock. "Dunkin' Donuts is gone," said one. "Oh my God," whispered a woman as they drove up Ocean Avenue, the main drag through town. The business district was destroyed. Finally, 77-year-old retiree Ira Kornblut raised his fist. "We're coming back," he said, choking back tears. "We're Sea Brighters!" As towns up and down the eastern seaboard take stock of tens of billions of dollars in damage from one of the worst storms to hit the U.S., authorities and residents speak publicly about their intent to rebuild. "I promised to everybody that I was speaking on behalf of the country when I said we are going to be here until the rebuilding is complete, and I meant it," President Barack Obama
said Thursday during a visit to New York City's battered Staten Island. But with the federal budget deep in the red and government flood insurance still straining to recover from Hurricane Katrina, Sea Bright and other coastal towns face questions over not just how to rebuild in a way that defends lives and property against surging sea levels and more intense storms, but whether to rebuild at all. Sandy's destructive path has united an unlikely coalition of free-market think tanks, environmentalists, business owners and insurers arguing the moral hazard of rebuilding in coastal zones that might best be returned to nature. "It's very difficult to get beyond the sympathy factor," said Orrin Pilkey,
a coastal geologist at Duke University. "But it works against us." He said he knows the issue firsthand: Hurricane Camille in 1969 damaged his parents' Mississippi home. Hurricane Katrina later obliterated it. "We are subsidizing, even encouraging, very dangerous development," he said. "It's amoral, really, that our government continues to blindly and stupidly do this." Repeated Southern California wildfires that leapfrog through hilly coastal enclaves, tornadoes that routinely slash through Southern and Midwestern towns, flooding rivers and hurricanes all trigger an avalanche of federal aid to help people restore homes and livelihoods. In New Jersey, Republican Gov. Chris Christie
this week acknowledged the difficulty of rebuilding but said, "We're going to be with you through every hardship, through every frustration and every step toward bringing New Jersey and its great shore back to the vitality it had the last summer and it's had my entire life." After Sandy: Sea Bright, N.J.

NOAA/Google No political leader would expect re-election after abandoning a storm-ravaged community. But with fiscal austerity and smaller government at the top of the national political agenda, some question the use of taxpayer-backed loans and other assistance to rebuild potentially dangerous communities. New Jersey, for example, is the most densely populated state in the U.S., with the bulk of its residents settled in counties along the shoreline. "People keep saying we're going to put everything back the way it was," said Stephen Sweeney, the Democratic president of the New Jersey state senate. "No, we're not. It makes no sense to do the same thing over and over again, throwing good money after bad." In some low-lying areas, he said, he will encourage the federal government to "write checks, level the homes and let the land return to its natural state." New Jersey scores high among states for safe residential construction through its strict enforcement of modern building codes, according to a report card compiled earlier this year by the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety, an industry-funded group. Sea Bright has implemented protective measures over the years, most notably a 15-foot-high sea wall that was built in the 1940s and runs along most of the three-mile-long town. The town has water pumps, runoff inlets and bulkheads to mitigate periodic flooding. An estimated 1.2 million cubic yards of sand was scheduled for delivery this month to Sea Bright and neighboring Monmouth Beach, a long-planned beach improvement delayed by Sandy. The federal government pays 75% of the $19 million cost, with the rest paid from state and local funds. None of the existing measures did much to protect the town's 1,400 mostly year-round residents against Sandy. Sea Bright is a mixed-income community that despite being only 22 miles south of Manhattan takes pride in its small-town atmosphere. The hardware store has been on Ocean Avenue for decades. Locals chat over early morning coffee at Steve's diner. Families have gathered for generations at eight private beach clubs, with names like Driftwood and Ship Ahoy, the heart of the town's summer tourism business. Donovan's and other bars feature local bands, including over the years New Jersey-raised rock stars Bruce Springsteen
and Jon Bon Jovi. Over the course of a few hours on Oct. 29, a 13-foot storm surge, propelled by 100-mile-per-hour winds, tore through town. Seawater filled homes, businesses and streets with a tsunami of sand that clogged drainage pipes and runoff inlets. A wave swept one resident from the front of his home and down the street. He survived. By the next morning, the sea had receded but the sand remained. "There are no words for it," said Mayor Dina Long.
She spoke while earth-moving equipment dug out the downtown. "Our businesses were wiped away." Authorities have condemned dozens of buildings, including a men's clothing store, Sunoco station and the home of a former mayor. Donovan's was a heap of splintered boards. Seven of the eight private beach clubs are ruined, their swimming pools filled with sand. Sandy piled up dozens of boats like toys. Officials put preliminary estimates of building damage at nearly $400 million. "We have some decisions to make," said Andy Dietz,
61 years old. Flooding tore his front door from the hinges and left it in the living room of his soaked home. Out back, the storm left the deck from a nearby restaurant, McLoone's. One decision is whether Sea Bright can afford to rebuild itself. Of the town's 1,211 residences and dozens of businesses, a large percentage has flood insurance through the 44-year-old National Flood Insurance Program, according to government figures and local estimates. But the program, which operates under the Federal Emergency Management Agency, pays a maximum of $250,000 per residential structure and $100,000 for contents. Robert Adler,
Sea Bright's town architect, said that won't be enough for homeowners to rebuild. Payouts to businesses are capped at $500,000 for structures and $500,000 for contents. "The biggest challenge is financial," said Mr. Adler. "Where will these people get the additional money to rebuild? We will either have an amazing renaissance or a colossal failure. There's not much room in between." One alternative would be to build a new Sea Bright, not a replica. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the South Carolina coast near Charleston, sweeping away many of the low-lying beach bungalows on nearby islands, including Isle of Palms, a popular tourist spot. The island was rebuilt with private-sector and government flood-insurance proceeds to comply with the latest construction techniques. The region is yet to be tested by a major storm but its makeover has shifted the mix of local housing. "We have seen a huge transition from small modest homes to the megastructures" perched on fat pilings, said Timothy Reinhold,
chief engineer at the Insurance Institute for Building & Home Safety. The federal government also could offer to buy properties in vulnerable parts of town, relocate the residents and return the cleared land to the floodplain. In 1998, a flash flood inundated Corning, Ohio, a small town that has endured repeated flooding. FEMA bought about 30 of the town's 239 homes, demolished them and moved residents to higher ground nearby. FEMA covered 75% of the cost, with the rest coming from state and local sources. "It was a bold course of action, not without controversy," said Chad Berginnis, the county planner at the time and now executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers in Madison, Wis. Some residents lost childhood homes and the town lost tax revenue. "But the mayor always came back to what was the right thing to do by her citizens." Any wholesale relocation would be a difficult sell in beach towns. Coastal neighborhoods have drawn new residents at the rate of about 3,500 a day, a migration that has made seaside counties five times more densely populated than inland counties. Since 1970, spurred by new housing and resorts, the U.S. coastal population has swelled by nearly half, with property values in hurricane-prone regions on the Atlantic and Gulf up 42% since 2004 to $10.2 trillion, according to AIR Worldwide, a risk-modeling firm. The migration to the sea continues despite coastal erosion from storms and natural wave action that claims roughly 1,500 homes a year, according to a government commission on ocean policy. "In an ideal world, should you be able to live wherever you want, however you want and be rebuilt several times?" said Julie Rochman,
chief executive of the Tampa, Fla.-based Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety. "Probably not, but that's what we do in this country, and that's got to stop" unless homeowners are willing to pay insurance rates commensurate with the risks. The FEMA flood-insurance program is already heavily indebted after borrowing nearly $18 billion from Treasury to cover claims from Katrina, as well as years of subsidizing rates for more than a fifth of its 5.6 million residential and business policyholders. With these subsidies, people pay premiums less than half the program's full-risk rate, according to government research. Critics say discount rates mask the actual risk of coastal living and discourage spending to fortify homes against wind and water damage. In general, homeowners are required to install stronger windows and roofs, or raise foundations onto pilings, only after storms damage their property or when they're remodeling for personal reasons. Along the New Jersey shore, many homes don't sit on pilings because they were built long before such requirements. Historically, the federal flood insurance program has paid a disproportionately large share of claims on the same houses and businesses, so-called repetitive-loss properties. They are often older structures in vulnerable, low-lying neighborhoods. A smaller group, severe repetitive-loss properties, comprises those that have received at least four payments of more than $5,000 each, or two payments cumulatively exceeding the property's value. Since 1978, claims by 166,368 repetitive-loss properties have cost the program more than $12 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service. Nearly $1 billion of the damage came from 12,432 properties in New Jersey. Those tallied up 42,353 claims, to rank the state third in the number of such claims behind Louisiana and Texas. Sea Bright had 412 claims from 140 properties, FEMA said, collecting $9.5 million. Repetitive-loss properties that are currently covered by the flood program have represented about 16% of total claims payments since 1978, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Nationwide, 2,667 of the 71,000 currently insured repetitive-loss properties have filed 10 or more claims. Enlarge Image
The mayor addressed residents of Sea Bright, N.J., during a meeting at a local football field earlier this month to talk about when they could return to see homes and businesses. Jason Andrew for The Wall Street Journal "This is a classic conflict between short-term political interests and long-term rational public policy," said Martin Bunzl, a philosophy professor at Rutgers University who is writing a book on the intersection of philosophy and climate policy. "We have no public policy interest in seeing houses rebuilt in low-lying areas. If the inclination is for insurance companies to say it's too risky, we should not use political leaders to undermine that decision." This summer, Mr. Obama signed legislation boosting the rates paid by many subsidized policyholders to more closely track conventional market rates. For Sea Bright and other communities along the New Jersey shore, some of the questions about the future may extend beyond the practical. "The biggest challenge is to make sure that the spirit that defined a community is kept alive," said Craig Taffaro,
the former president of St. Bernard Parish, La., one of the areas hardest hit by Katrina, and now the director of hazard mitigation and recovery coordination for his state government. About 65% of the parish's pre-Katrina population of 68,000 has returned, he said. "You can have the lights on and the churches physically there," he added. "But the spirit and soul of a community has to be embodied in those buildings to fully recover." Last week in Sea Bright, Frank Bain,
59 years old, rummaged through the hardware store on Ocean Avenue he has run with his wife, Patty, since 1994. The store's slogan: "If Bain's doesn't have it, you don't need it." Five feet of water destroyed all his stock. He carried no flood insurance, which means he lost everything. "What I need right now is a dollar and a dream," he said. "We'll do the best we can and the best we can for everyone. But no one can honestly say we have a plan yet, none of us."

European stocks nudged higher after Germany's central bank delivered an upbeat assessment of the country's economic outlook, but moves were muted with Wall Street closed for a public holiday. The benchmark Stoxx 600 index rose 0.3% Monday to 287.78. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index gained 0.4% to 6180.98—its third consecutive gain and highest close since May 22, 2008. Germany's DAX advanced 0.6% to 7748.86, and France's CAC-40 added 0.6% to 3763.03, its highest close since July 26, 2011. Financial markets struggled for direction amid light volumes with U.S. stock markets closed to observe Martin Luther King day. Still, European stocks ended slightly higher, with sentiment underpinned by comments from Germany's central bank. The Deutsche Bundesbank said the outlook for the domestic economy had improved and that any slowdown experienced by the euro zone's largest economy would be short-lived. The Bundesbank had earlier slashed its forecast for German growth next year to 0.4% from its June estimate of 1.6%, warning that the nation could sink into recession. Since then, however, the central bank said companies' expectations have improved, particularly with regards to the outlook for exports. In currency markets, the euro was steady against the dollar despite German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition losing power in the Lower Saxony state election on Sunday. Those results bode ill for Ms. Merkel's re-election bid this year. The euro was at $1.3315 by the end of European trading from $1.3312 late Friday in New York. Shares in Pearson

Asian stock markets ended mixed on Tuesday, while the yen strengthened and Japanese stocks fell after the Bank of Japan
announced the results of its latest policy meeting. The dollar weakened against the yen after the Bank of Japan committed itself to a 2% inflation target and an open-ended asset purchasing program, pledging to carry on purchasing financial assets as long it considers it necessary. The greenback was ¥89.01 in late Asian trade, compared to ¥89.62 late Monday in New York. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power last month with plans to end the country's long term deflation problem, which has resulted in downward pressure on the yen in recent months. The central bank's announcement was "pretty much in-line with expectations. There was not much of a surprise as most of it was already well telegraphed in advance," said Wee-Khoon Chong, senior interest rate strategist at Societe Generale
