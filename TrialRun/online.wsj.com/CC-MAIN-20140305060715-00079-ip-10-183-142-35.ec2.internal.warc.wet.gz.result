   By Saabira Chaudhuri 
 Forest City Enterprises Inc. (FCEA, FCEB) said Bruce Ratner will step down as chief executive of Brooklyn-based unit Forest City Ratner Co., effective immediately, and it named MaryAnne Gilmartin, its executive vice president of commercial and residential development, to succeed him. Mr. Ratner will serve as executive chairman of Forest City Ratner Co., or FCRC. Forest billed the transition as being part of the company's ongoing succession planning, reiterating a view it offered in January, when it responded to media reports that Mr. Ratner intended to step down. At the time, Forest said it had no definitive announcement to make on potential leadership succession. FCRC, which has built such recognizable projects as the new Barclays Center basketball arena in Brooklyn and the New York Times building in Midtown Manhattan, was helmed by founder Bruce Ratner, who sold his stake to Forest City Enterprises seven years ago. Mr. Ratner is a prolific developer who has spent the past three decades successfully battling for public approvals of large and often controversial projects. His company pioneered downtown Brooklyn development in the 1980s with its MetroTech project that became a big success. But Forest City also launched many big projects in the years leading up to the economic downturn and some of them have fallen short of projections. Meanwhile, Ms. Gilmartin joined FCRC in 1994. During her 18-year tenure, she has been involved in a number of the company's most visible projects in the region, including Barclays Center arena, New York by Gehry at 8 Spruce Street and the New York Times Building. She began her career in real estate in 1986 as a New York City urban fellow at the Public Development Corporation. "Under the leadership of Bruce Ratner, the New York metropolitan area has become our largest core market and a key component of our overall value-creation model," Forest City Enterprises CEO David J. LaRue said. "We are thrilled that MaryAnne Gilmartin will continue this legacy and assume day-to-day leadership of FCRC as president and CEO, and that Bruce will continue to play a key role as executive chairman.

Do we need religion to have ethics? Is it possible that a world without religion can be, on the whole, a better place to live?

"Someone has to teach me that it is called a banana. I don't know much in Spanish, not because I'm not logical and cannot figure out the meaning of Spanish words using my powers of deduction, but because I haven't taken the time to learn the words and their meaning. It has nothing to do with how logical I am."http://online.wsj.com/community/groups/religion-diversity-tolerance-governance/topics/do-we-need-religion-have?commentid=5330150And that, "someone has to teach me," Nancy, is where the whole thing breaks down.In the beginning someone had to come up with the number system, math, and logic that we now use. I've always felt uncomfortable with what we have, not because it doesn't work but because it doesn't work better. Thus I've never been happy with the fact that pi is not a whole number, or at least some number that is more manageable than an infinite chain of random numbers but for what generates them. The same is true of symbols in trigonometry and imaginary numbers. Why not a simpler system for everything? Maybe if we had started with more insight than just what straight lines gave us, we would have deviced and entirely different system of numbers, math and logic.I remember when I was a little kid having difficulty with multiplication tables. I just couldn't see their most basic underlying logic and I still don't. Near as I can tell we have to learn and memorize at least some of the basic operations; then analogy and a few simple rules do kick in and work well, but what is their basis? And I am back to why pi is so unwieldy.Now here is the interesting part. My granddaughter loves learning, loves BrainPop, is way ahead of her age in reading, science, and general knowledge, and even handles quite complex mathematical problems, but she is stumped with the multiplication tables, hates them because she can't see their underlying logic. Why? Just genes or is there something else? Someone has to teach us like with what is a banana? And then it better fit well our likes and dislikes, or do we just accept the idea of a banana blindly? Now I know Zach will come back and say that a banana is material and objective. But so is an atom but that doesn't make the Standard Model of physics objective no matter how much logic or math it is based on. It is just a man made representation we chose to device and while it works extremely well for certain phenomena it doesn't for others, and it is totally useless for those that haven't been thought and understand it."Richard Feynman, the late Nobel Laureate in physics, was once asked by a Caltech faculty member to explain why spin one-half particles obey Fermi Dirac statistics. Rising to the challenge, he said, "I'll prepare a freshman lecture on it." But a few days later he told the faculty member, "You know, I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don't understand it." wikiTo me the logic of Zach is no more and no less a man made construct like the Bible, at least for me.

Don’t worry, I’ll respond comprehensively to your posts above, but I saw this and I couldn’t help but get in a quick reply:“To me the logic of Zach is no more and no less a man made construct like the Bible, at least for me.”I agree, and I’ve agreed all along. The “logic of Zach” is one epistemology, and the Bible is another. Both are ultimately our tools of gaining knowledge, so in a way they only exist because our conscious minds give them definition. My discussion with Nancy revolves around trying to apply logic to Christianity, which ultimately never works. Within the unfettered bubble of revealed knowledge, logic doesn’t matter anyway, as primacy is always given to knowledge revealed by an authority. Such knowledge has no need to be vetted by logic or evidence, because those methods reside in different epistemologies and are thus irrelevant.Also, I must say, there is a bit of a contrarian in you, Xavier. You must have been a rebellious teen of sorts ;)

"My discussion with Nancy revolves around trying to apply logic to Christianity, which ultimately never works."Nonsense. The logic of Zach may not work, but Christianity is very logical to those who take the time to understand the basic language and elements that make up Christianity. My point from the beginning is that you, Zach, don't understand God's logic because you don't have the knowledge and understanding of God. You don't want it. You don't believe it. So what makes you think you can logically understand it? I understand Christianity and it makes logical sense to me because I believe the revealed knowledge the Bible teaches, just as I understood and believed when my parents revealed to me the word for banana.

I still am rebellious and it is another reason I can't agree with you on everything. Where would I be if I did ;)Oh, and I agree with Nancy. Moreover, and back to fairness, one problem with understanding what it means, why material equality doesn't seem possible or sufficient, is that what makes us different from other animals is a spiritual dimension, a dimension where God and Nancy's religion reside. Whether you like it or not, material and spiritual go hand in hand. That's what makes us human.Yeah, and I like bananas. My grandmother used to grow them in her backyard in Cuernavaca, Mexico :).Oh, and btw, maybe in time we have come to agree or understand each other more because we understand each other's logic and language better. That was my point over a year ago when I said I disliked debate and "fights," and instead preferred dialogue and exploration.

“You, Zach, don't understand God's logic because you don't have the knowledge and understanding of God.”Do you, Nancy, claim to have the full knowledge and understanding of an omnipotent being? If not, how can you understand him logically any better than I can?“I understand Christianity and it makes logical sense to me because I believe the revealed knowledge the Bible teaches, just as I understood and believed when my parents revealed to me the word for banana.”Did you believe in the revealed knowledge at the exact moment that you learned all the words involved in communicating the message, or was there a development? Can you imagine a difference in the thought process that you use to associate a word with an object and the thought process you use to assert that all statements made by the words of the Bible are true?I guess this is good practice, getting back to basics and such. It’s still a little frustrating, though, when someone knows everything and can’t take the time to learn a thing or two (and before you jump on me for that, Xavier, remember all those times I’ve conceded to you and others here; oh yes, I can definitely be wrong and I can definitely learn).

Nancy said: "You, Zach, don't understand God's logic because you don't have the knowledge and understanding of God.”Zach answered: "Do you, Nancy...?" Come on Zach, see what I mean? If Nancy understands God's logic sufficiently for her purposes, why should anything else matter?"Do you, Nancy, claim to have the full knowledge and understanding of an omnipotent being? If not, how can you understand him logically any better than I can?"If there is something you don't understand in what she says, ask. Why take a combative stance? That just puts everyone on the defensive, to Nancy's credit much less with her, and then you don't get an explanation that is as good and comprehensive as it could have been. A challenged person replies to the narrow challenge and a lot of possible exploration and new understanding is foregone, and perhaps lost if people disengage in frustration and even anger. Again, Nancy is an unusual exception and we should all be grateful to her for that.

Zach,I do not claim to have the full knowledge and understanding of the omnipotent God, but I have studied and prayed and sought to understand what He has revealed, and as a result have made certain logical conclusions as to why God allows and does what he does, and what this world is all about and where it is all going. The first step for me was to understand the words and concepts used in the Bible. I remember reading Revelation and thinking it was odd there was a lamb in heaven. Then I learned that Christ was portrayed as a lamb who takes away the sins of the world. So I had to learn the Old Testament and the role of the lamb. I had to learn the difference between the Old and New Testaments and the reasons for them, and then I came across the teaching that God had planned it all before the very creation of the world. I can't tell you the number of times in discussions like this one when someone would show me a contradiction in the Bible and tell me I was a fool to believe it. I read the contradiction and realized they were right. Then I looked closer, I prayed, I studied and found they were not right. They lacked understanding. That bolstered my faith in the teaching, and the next time I was not so quick to accept the critics accusations. After years of this, my understanding has increased. Do I know it all? No. Do I know more than I did to begin with? Yes, a lot more. I view the Scripture as a large picture that reveals a truth, and the more I put into place, the clearer the picture becomes. I don't think someone who rejects the Bible outright can do that.As I said a few posts ago, Greg views as unreasonable the sacrifice of Jesus for our sins. He only sees a "God who sacrificed himself to himself to save mankind from himself?" Ugh. I can't tell you the number of times I've heard that very same criticism. I know the answer, but how do I communicate it to someone who has no knowledge of the very basics of my faith? Our discussion began with questioning the understanding of why God allows what he allows. Imagine how frustrating it is for me to have to defend the fact that God understands English. That his logic concerning the world and what he allows to happen has no bearing on the fact that he can understand and communicate with man. In fact, he has done it in two ways, through his written word, the Bible, and the living Word, Christ. If you want to know the innermost thoughts of God expressed outwardly to you--the Logos--it is Christ.

Part I
As I continue to read Carl T Bogus's article on the origins of the second amendment, the history is fascinating. He recountst that the amendments was originally thought to be "collectivist". That is that it applied to a group of people organized as a militia. He says that rather recently a new school of thought arose. He calls these the "Insurrectionest" school. These scholars believe that the 2nd amendment is addressed to an individuals right to bear arms in order to resist a government that no longer serves the people. Bogus contends that the insurrectionists draw their proof from the English Declaration of Rights written in 1689. Bogus goes on to say that one of the main proponents of this school is Joyce Malcolm. "Malcolm's thesis is that the Second Amendment was derived from the English Declaration of Rights, also known as the Bill of Rights, of 1689. With this, there is no quarrel. But Malcolm goes further. She argues that the Declaration of Rights granted an individual right, that is, that it gave individuals the right to keep and bear arms notwithstanding the enactment of any laws to the contrary. She also argues that the purpose of this right was to allow individuals "to have arms for self-defence and self-preservation."[322] With these last two propositions, Malcolm stands on shaky ground. In fact, it may not be too extreme to say that she is patently wrong."
Bogus then goes into some familar territory in investigating the Declaration of Rights. That is the Glorious Revolution which deposed James II and installed Wiliam of Orange as King of England. The Declaration of Rights among other things is a statement of Parliaments right ot make laws rather than the Kings right. William and his heirs would be sovereigns but the laws would be made by Parlament. It should be understood that before 1689, there was no individual right to bear arms in England. And the Declaration of Rights did not grant new rights but restate ones that had been abrogated by James II.
"Obviously, the parties did not intend the Crown to determine what arms Protestants could possess. The provision was written in response to James's attempt to arrogate this power to himself; its purpose was to restrict the Crown's authority. There are only two other possible sources of law: Parliament and common law. As Malcolm concedes, there was no individual right to have arms in England before 1689, [369] and, therefore, no such right had been recognized by common law. This leaves Parliament, which had been regulating the ownership of arms for five hundred years, as Malcolm herself catalogues.[370] Thus, the Declaration of Rights, which became the Bill of Rights when Parliament enacted it by statute after William and Mary signed it,[371] did not give Protestants an individual right to have arms; it decreed that Parliament, and not the Crown, would determine the right of Protestants to have arms.[372]"

All I take from your Bogus exploration is the old dilemma of the best balance between the rights and responsibilities of the individual and those of the community, of the few and of the many. All issues that depend on balancing for their resolution will always present two sides, and people can and will always elaborate on them ad nauseam, unfortunately almost always taking solely one side or another. Here at least your people took a stab at both.

Xavier,
The problem here is that the current interpretation of the 2nd Amendment is in all probability based on a fiction. It is derived from the English Bill of Rghts which did not confer the right of each and every Englishmen to bear arms. If that were true, you might see the proliferation of guns in the UK on the order of what is present here. And you don't see that. Though Bogus states that Madison may have made Insurrectionist remarks , he was first and foremost a federalist. As the English Bill of Rights did not believe that bicameral government could be tyrannical but that a King could, the American Founder that wrote the constitution (Madison) shared that sentiment. That would make the 2nd Amendment a structural solution to a real problem of the day. Southerners had a real concern that anti-slave Northerners would use federal powers to prevent local militias from pursuing their slave patrol duties. This could be equated to James II attempt at restricting the right of Protestants to carry weapons but giveing the right to Catholics. So he wrote a structural solution that gave the right of locals acting as a militia to bear arms. Madison and his Federalist compadres were terrified that incidences like Shay's Rebellion could destabilize the fledgeling union. With that mindset he would not have written a constitution that encouraged such actions. Once we understand the various fictions that underlie our attitudes and institutons, we can instigate changes that make sense but for some loyalty we think that we owe a rule written long ago to address a sometimes scurrilous purpose. This is the predicament of the conservative. Sometimes attitudes and opinions are anchored to notions that either relevant long ago but no longer or that were based on complete misreads of the applicable history.

Part II
Bogus reiiterates his contention that the English Declaration of Rights which became the English Bill of Rights did not grant an individuals right to bear arms.
"According to Lois G. Schwoerer of George Washington University, the House of Lords added the clauses "suitable to their condition" and "as allowed by law" to make it clear that all Protestants did not enjoy a right to have arms.[373] Schwoerer explains: [Page 385]
First, the idea that all Protestants should be permitted to posses a gun surely terrified the upper House . . . . The potential dangers to property and life from permitting all Protestants to have a weapon were self- evident. Second, the right to possess arms had always been closely connected with the subjects' military obligations, which, since the twelfth century, had been equated with subjects' socioeconomic status . . . . Theoretically, not every person was supposed to have weapons and serve in the military. Third, for over 150 years, other legislation had restricted the possession of guns and other weapons to well-to-do-persons . . . . Fourth, the peers' amendments almost certainly drew inspiration from the game laws, which, since the fourteenth century, had preserved the hunting privileges of the king and the upper classes by restricting the possession of weapons to the wealthy.[374]"
Bogus believes that this doesn't mean that the American Founders didn't intend that there shouldn't be an individual right to bear arms,But it does mean that such a right is not derived from the English Bill of Rights. He goes on to say "They understood the Glorious Revolution,[378] saw their [Page 386] own revolution as a parallel endeavor,[379] and, in some instances, modeled the American Bill of Rights on the English Declaration of Rights of 1689.[380] With the most minor of changes, for example, Madison copied article 10 of the Declaration verbatim, where it now stands as the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[381] Although he did not take it quite so directly, Madison was almost certainly influenced by the right to have arms provision of the Declaration as well. The similarity of circumstance could not have been lost on him. In 1689, Parliament needed to address the fear that Protestants might be disarmed and left defenseless against Catholics. In 1789, Madison needed to allay the fear that the militia might be disarmed, leaving whites defenseless against blacks. Madison followed Parliament's solution. Both the Declaration and the Second Amendment resolve the problem by transferring the power to disarm the favored group (Protestants and the militia) from the distrusted arm of government (the Crown and Congress) to a more trusted authority (Parliament and the states)."
This is fascinating stuff!!!

Xavier, Greg never had any credibility with right wing diehards, so that says nothing new. Who you should be challenging is Mr. Bogus. I know it's fun to make fun of his name. We used to do things like that in high school. What is more difficult is to actually refute the research Bogus is writing about. Because this is not the first time I have heard this. There was a lawyer whom i don't remember the name who argued this precise point about slavery rebellions in a brief with the Supreme Court some years ago. And no, I don't remember the date, etc. And yes, you guys can tell me i have no credibility with you either, but putting me and Greg down does not change the facts. Before you make fun of people, you might do some checking around beside repeating NRA talking points. There's a trustworthy organization! The NRA would never misrepresent, would it? It has no vested interest in guns so they are totally impartial, right? You remember the one about people who live in glass houses, don't you?

Peter,It's funny how quickly Xavier accepts various fictions that support his point of view. He readily accepts the various fictions of the bible because he thinks that the bible is the glue that holds western culture together. On that front he is dead wrong. But it gets worse. He readily accepts a revisionist explanation of the 2nd amendment and doesn't seem to know it. It was known as a collectivist right up until a bunch of academics decided to support their notions of government overreach and the individual right to bear arms with scholarship supporting that thesis. How is that one who holds on to one fictional account after the other claims credibility while simultaneously condemning those that know better. The language in the 2nd Amendment was always kind of cryptic until put into the correct context. Either Madison sought to write a clause that undermined his most cherished accomplishment - a stable union or he wrote something that addressed concerns of half the country. Maybe I'm a simpleton as Xavier says.incapable of understanding complex ideas that linger just under dust covers of history. But how would one have dealt with the various slave uprisings that actually happened if there was no provision to arm the locals? Virginia was at the center of anti-federalist sentiment. But it was also the home of as many Virginians as African slaves. From time to time slaves didn't like being slaves. What would have been Virginians primary concern?

Greg,I do think you enjoy the rewriting of history. I've noticed you view many long held beliefs as "fictions" that you and your writers feel the need to set straight with your own 21st century thinking. In my view a much simpler explanation of the 2nd Amendment is found in the reading of the Declaration of Independence and the writings of John Locke. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."John Locke, "But if any one should ask, Must the people then always lay themselves open to the cruelty and rage of tyranny? Must they see their cities pillaged, and laid in ashes, their wives and children exposed to the tyrant's lust and fury, and themselves and families reduced by their king to ruin, and all the miseries of want and oppression, and yet sit still? Must men alone be debarred the common privilege of opposing force with force, which nature allows so freely to all other creatures for their preservation from injury? I answer: Self-defence is a part of the law of nature; nor can it be denied the community, even against the king himself:" So an easy question would be: Why would the writers of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution proclaim the equality of ALL men under God, and then make the second amendment for the purpose of arming only whites in order hold tyranny over blacks? Why didn't they just write into the Constitution that men are not equal to begin with? No, the second amendment had nothing to do with slavery. It was there to protect a free people from their enslavement by a tyrant. I do realize the irony and hypocrisy of slave holders being tyrants over slaves who could not defend themselves against the tyranny. If only they had "the common privilege of opposing force with force." But the true danger at this time for the colonists was not the slave, but the king.

PeterGreg loses credibility when he invokes a persons opinion as evidence of fact.You lose credibility when you defend his opinion of an opinion, calling it research.It's not science, it's a person's point of view.Who is Carl T. Bogus? Here's his blog.http://www.carlbogus.com/edmund-a-blogNotice the title. "A Blog with a Burkean Point of View". It's how he thinks, it's his "Burkean" point of view.As to the research. What research?English law is well documented, easily accessible, it's non an expedition.Now, when it comes to a refutation of Bogus' point of view, scroll down two comments below and read what Nancy has to say.

Peter,In this post on gun control and the NRA, which you addressed to me, you say " but putting me...down does not change the facts..." Pray tell, where did I put you down? Do you feel victimized? By association?I am used to Greg making up things about me, including just now when he writes about my opinion of the Bible when I've said repeatedly that I've never read it and therefore can't possibly have an opinion other than about the logic, or lack of it, that others like him expound, but you? I also know Greg feels victimized, but you?

Nancy:“We learn a language through association and repetition.”Association and repetition are cognitive tasks. Cognitive tasks are accomplished via cognitive processes. Tasks like association and repetition are accomplished via a process called inference. Inference is a logical process in which the brain identifies X as X because it infers that X is X based on previous associations. “I cannot use logic to determine what they call that curved yellow fruit in English. Someone has to teach me that it is called a banana.”Oh, now I think I see where the problem is. Let’s try something else:1.	P - The teacher shows you a curved yellow fruit and tells you it is called a banana.2.	P - You believe that the teacher is telling you the truth.3.	Q – Thus, you now know that the curved yellow fruit is called a banana.The same syllogism in symbol form:1.	P – X says Y is Z.2.	P – X is true.3.	Q – Thus, Y is Z.That’s the logical thought process used to make initial linguistic associations. In psychology, this is called inference. These associations are also reinforced logically. For example:1.	P – Your mother calls a curved yellow fruit a banana, just like your teacher.2.	P – If your mom calls a curved yellow fruit a banana, you have no reason to believe your teacher was lying.3.	Q – Thus, you know that a curved yellow fruit is still called a banana.Without inference, which is the “process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true”, none of these associations can happen. Isn’t that obvious by now? Your teacher tells you the yellow fruit is called a banana—that’s the first premise. You assume that your teacher is telling the truth—that’s the second premise. The yellow fruit is called a banana—that’s the logical conclusion you derive from those premises.“I have searched and searched the internet to find something that tells me you need logic to understand a language.”That’s part of the problem; you have no formal training in this, so you don’t even know what to look for. It’s a bit like me using evilbible.com to understand Christianity ;) (just kidding)These were the two core textbooks of my Cognitive Theory of Linguistics 301 class:http://www.amazon.com/Psycholinguistics-Cambridge-Textbooks-Linguistics-Michael/dp/0521276411http://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Language-Data-Theory/dp/1841693820/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1358445689&sr=1-1&keywords=the+psychology+of+language

Zach,I looked into those books, but quickly realized I'm too cheap to spend $65.00 on a book when I don't know what it says. It did give me an idea, so I searched it out and found a site about Psychology of Language at Duke University. It's here: http://people.duke.edu/~pk10/language/psych.htm The controversy is about nature vs. nurture. One side views the ability of humans to acquire language because we are already prewired for it, while the other sees we have the capability, but must learn language from our culture. Here's a sample: "As mentioned before, linguist Noam Chomsky suggests that humans are born with an innate knowledge of language, and he calls this knowledge the 'language faculty.' He invisions this 'language faculty' as a biologically autonomous system in the brain that 'has an initial state which is genetically determined, like. . . the kidney, the circulatory system, and so on' (13)."Chomsky supports his claim with several lines of evidence. For one thing, he argues that all humans (except, of course, those suffering from a language-related pathology) understand certain ambiguities of language the same way. For example, take the expression 'brown house,' which could be expressed in another language as well as English. Upon hearing this expression, any human would have certain understandings that were not expressed with language explicitly. For example, even children realize that this expression contains two separate words with separate meanings, quite a feat when considering that the spoken phenomes generally run together. When spoken in English, a listener will know that the two words contain the same vowel sound. More surprisingly, when this phrase is spoken in any language, the listener will understand that the speaker is referring to a house that is brown on the outside. This is remarkable, because houses can just as easily have brown interiors, but listeners never have to ask which surface (inner or outer) the color is naming (Chomsky 20-21). Chomsky argues that this type of linguistic knowledge must be innate since every healthy human makes the same assumptions. He also suggests that knowledge such as that described above must exist in the language faculty in the brain."Linguist M. Y. Liberman describes other characteristics found in every spoken human language. First, all of these languages have very large vocabularies consisting of words 'whose articulatory/acoustic definition is mediated by a phonological system.' Second, all languages have a grammatical system that governs the way in which these words are combined to express meaning. Third, all languages change throughout time with new words being added and old ones being dropped or changed continuously (qtd. in Studdert-Kennedy 8)."Anthropologist Donald E. Brown describes even more detailed aspects of language that all humans share. First, in any given language words can exist that are the equivalent of 'good,' 'wide,' and 'deep.' In some languages, opposite words (bad, narrow, and shallow) exist also. In others, however, the opposites are formed with a negating word and the original juxtaposed (not good, not wide, not deep). The surprising finding is that in no language does the negation go the other way ('not bad' to express 'good,' etc.). Does this happen because the expression of such concepts as good, wide, and deep lies in the language faculty and is innate in all humans? Chomsky would say that it does. He would also cite other universals listed by Brown, including the fact that all languages contain nouns, verbs, and possessive formations, as well as the fact that poetry around the world has lines that last about three seconds in between pauses, as evidence of a 'language faculty' genetically present in all human brains (Brown 132)."

Nancy:“Our discussion began with questioning the understanding of why God allows what he allows. Imagine how frustrating it is for me to have to defend the fact that God understands English.”After all this, do you really think that’s what you’re defending? If so, I’m not sure I can teach you this.“The controversy is about nature vs. nurture. One side views the ability of humans to acquire language because we are already prewired for it, while the other sees we have the capability, but must learn language from our culture.”This is the fundamental debate within psycholinguistics, yes. However, if you were to ever acquire one of these books (especially the first one), you could read in some of the very first chapters about the fundamentals of the field, including a careful study of how we make linguistic associations. We do so through thought processes. One of these processes is called inference, and it is a form of logical thought.Okay, I found you another book from back in the day (this one is free!). I hope you’ll read the whole thing one day when you have time, but for our purposes here, I skimmed around until I found some of the material that I remembered (vaguely, college was three years ago) as pertaining to our discussion:“Presumably, the child must in part analyze terms as primary argument or predicate terms in order to use these as properties for representing grammatical strings and forming word class categories…Object terms are natural primary argument terms. This would follow from the fact that humans probably see properties and relations as obtaining of or between concrete objects.” (p. 140)http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=7VAwkIsF5nkC&oi=fnd&pg=PA97&dq=learnability+theory&ots=OAnf0E0rxw&sig=jKXgJ8Vw35WGiHO-JAdGdZ-D_Vg#v=onepage&q=learnability%20theory&f=falseNow, if you dig deeper into this essay, you’ll notice that Pinker acknowledges alternative theories of learning, but doesn’t really buy the argument behind them just yet. Needless to say, I’m in his boat ;)

While i have no technical knowledge or study on that matter what so ever, i would not be inclined to agree with Mr Chomsky on this (whom i believe to be one of the grater minds of our time).I dont think logic is hardwired into our brain. My dog communicates with me, not on the same lvl a human does of course, but a degree. He points to his food bowl when he wants feeding. No one tough him that trick, but some how he managed to associate that his bowl is where he gets food and that if he brings our attention to it, he will get feed (unless he is on a diet, Beagles tend to roundness).While of course this says nothing about man kind, i would be inclined to believe that this very basic logic lvl is not specific for man kind.

Horacio,
I am not sure I got whether you agree or disagree with Chomsky (I am not even sure what Chomsky says :( ). Your dog somehow learned that going through certain motions gets him food.
I have a squirrel we named "chip" (because she has a nick on an ear) that does exactly the same. She is even able to tell whether we are in the front or back of the house and go to the proper window to get our attention and food.
So there is some learning mechanism and another expression mechanism in the brain that are connected, each using logic and both also connected by some kind of logic. Wouldn't the only difference between man and animal be that in man we are able to form complex expressions, i.e. what we call language? We have that additional organ, which I think is what Chomsky is saying, but it is an "organ" no different than and dependant on the others.

Certainly, however that would imply that our brains are hardwired in the same fashion as a dog. Think of it as the difference between software and hardware, Chomsky states that logic and association are hardwired into our brains. I tend to believe they are software. But of course i have no basis for it.

Horacio,
But can't the process be hardwired but the results of the processing not? Isn't that what the whole argument is about? One is hardwired, the other not? The language organ is a hardwired microchip with logic circuits that still requires software that is also logic based?
Have faith that some day you'll be able to program something that sophisticated :)

True, however, Chomsky position appears to be that language is organ dependent, which we know it is not the case for other brain functions. When the brain sustains injuries other parts of the brain become active to compensate. That tells me that while hardware is of course important, it is the soft (culture and so on) that drives the ability not the hardware.

Steven Pinker views the psychology of language through computationalism, but a new look into the subject uses connectionism. In the article I linked to it is explained in this way:"In order to understand how a culturally based model of language could account for these facts, it is important to examine how new models are being used to explain the brain and human behavior. The brain, above all else, is an organ whose purpose is to manipulate the behavior of the body in an environment to secure survival. This is true of all species from the snail to the human. It has been shown experimentally that experience causes structural and chemical changes at the synapses between neurons which means that learning takes place in the connections between neurons. If, for example, a dog finds that jumping over a fence allows him to eat some meat barbecuing in the neighbor's yard, and if this behavior gets this reward several times, then the connections between his neurons will strengthen in the path that goes from smelling meet to jumping the fence. If, however, the dog tries to jump the fence one day and gets shocked by an electrical wire, the weights of connections will become weaker. If this happens several times, then the neuronal path between smelling meat and jumping the fence will have a strong inhibitory connection, so that the dog no longer performs this behavior."How does this relate to a human brain producing and understanding language? Well, suppose a baby finds that if he produces the sound "wa-wa" he will receive a drink of water. The neuronal connections between his feeling of thirst and his speaking the sound "wa-wa" will be strongly excitatory, and he will have learned to communicate. If, however, his mother decides to break him from the habit of baby-talk and only gives him water when he pronounces the entire word "water," then the connections between thirst and "wa-wa" will become inhibitory and a new neural path, between thirst and "water," will become more excitatory."With this explanation I still don't see how logic precedes language, but would say that man's ability to use language is an important part of human cognition. From that we can use language to reason and use logic.From Wikipedia: "Computationalists posit symbolic models that do not resemble underlying brain structure at all, whereas connectionists engage in "low-level" modeling, trying to ensure that their models resemble neurological structures. Computationalists in general focus on the structure of explicit symbols (mental models) and syntactical rules for their internal manipulation, whereas connectionists focus on learning from environmental stimuli and storing this information in a form of connections between neurons. Computationalists believe that internal mental activity consists of manipulation of explicit symbols, whereas connectionists believe that the manipulation of explicit symbols is a poor model of mental activity. Computationalists often posit domain specific symbolic sub-systems designed to support learning in specific areas of cognition (e.g., language, intentionality, number), whereas connectionists posit one or a small set of very general learning mechanisms."

Zach,
I don't think the issue is reduction of crime as much as it is reduction of gun related mayhem. This morning I heard a commentator talking about the Austrailian experiment. After a gunman killed 35 Aussies at one time, they got tough on gun control. They banned assault rifles and undertook a serious attempt to collect a large number of the ones in circulation And this was the Conservative government that did this. The upshot. There hasn't been a mass killing since.
Now I know I have heard that other types of crimes have risen or fallen or something. But what they haven't had is some madman shooting up a bunch of innocent folks. As to the studies out there, they are all over the map. I often hear that where they have background checks and waiting periods, the number of women murdered with a gun has droppd 40%. The NRA can be held responsible for restricting the data that is available by passing laws that prevent the ATF from gathering data on gun violence and CDC from studying what happens. Hopefully one of Obama's executive orders can restore the flow of information. But then there is the premise in which we supposedly have the right to bear arms. There is serious question whether the 2nd Amendment was simply a measure set to solve an embarrassing parochial issue. The various fictions that we operate under that promulgate the idea that guns were always part of the American experiment are largely responsible for the predicament we find ourselves in. Even when we were a fledgeling country, the idea that frontier settlements armed to the teeth was untrue. The gunmen that we read about today were equivalent to the bad actors we saw in the early 20th century. " Scholars of violence who have looked at homicide found that there was little interpersonal violence in America prior to the 1840s. There was violence, but it was directed. It was state sanctioned. It was violence against slaves. It was violence against Indians. But it was not violence between individuals. These were peaceful communities. When I was doing my research, I found county court records that did not show a homicide in a 50-year period. The most violent counties averaged one homicide every four years. I expected that to change in the 19th century, but prior to 1840, there just weren't that many murders. http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_bellesiles_plby.html
It was after the Civil War that America started its fetish with the gun. So if the 2nd Amendment was to insure that the populace was ready to resist a tyrannical government, why did it take the populace neary 100 years to get armed? It was the carnage of the Civil War and the manufacturing and marketing genius of one Samuel Colt that started us on this path. Wildwest shows cemented a myth of the lone gunman, the sharpshooter. Billy the Kid and John Wesley Hardin were romanticized as skilled gunmmen when they were actuallly homicidal pychopaths. There was a also a true hunting subculture that emerged after the Civiil War. And if that is all we were face with, we wouldn't have the problems that we have. But the trouble with mythology is sometimes we believe it. All those quotes that Keith printed were probably spoken by anti-federalist that hated the idea of a strong federal government anyway. They lost. If the 2nd Amendment is based on the English Bill of Rights, there's a good chance that the idea that it promoted and indvidual right to bear arms is just plain wrong. When you combine the history of the English Bill of Rights, the writings and leanings of the author of the American Bill of Rights, the hypocrisy that slavery presented to both Northern and Southern constituencies but the necessity of the institution to the South, the idea that the Founders wanted yet another check on its government becomes far fetched. Ocaam's Razor rears it ugly head.

Remember Oklahoma City and the Bath Consolidated School in 1927?
We better get tough on explosives, including simple fertilizer like ammonium nitrate.

Well Greg, problems abound here. Your own source tells us that Americans weren’t particularly violent towards each other (on average) until 1840 or so. Were there less guns per capita back then? If fewer guns equals less crime, there should have been virtually no guns within our borders during that time. (I would imagine).We should also consider that the greatest “mayhem” perpetrated upon American citizens by other American citizens has historically had little to do with guns. Below, Xavier mentions the Oklahoma City Bombing. With fertilizer and racing fuel, Timothy McVeigh constructed and detonated an explosive that killed more people than Sandy Hook, Aurora, Tucson, and Columbine combined.At the risk of being too simplistic, it would seem fairly obvious that this is a people problem rather than a hardware problem. At the risk of being too folksy, it would be unwise to fix a clog in a gas line by adjusting the carburetor; indeed, you may create entirely new problems.

Zach,Actually I think the Feds enacted measures to trace the large purchases of ammonium nitrate based fertilizer. I think if you buy a certain amount , you will get a visit from your local FBI. As to the "tools" used in individual violence before the 1840's here's the full paragraph:"Scholars of violence who have looked at homicide found that there was little interpersonal violence in America prior to the 1840s. There was violence, but it was directed. It was state sanctioned. It was violence against slaves. It was violence against Indians. But it was not violence between individuals. These were peaceful communities. When I was doing my research, I found county court records that did not show a homicide in a 50-year period. The most violent counties averaged one homicide every four years. What was the weapon of choice? Generally, a bladed weapon, either an ax or a knife. I expected that to change in the 19th century, but prior to 1840, there just weren't that many murders. Maybe 80 percent of the cases involved bladed weapons. In contrast, today there are 24,000 homicides a year in America, in 70 percent of the cases the weapon used is a gun. Back then, the gun was unusual. If there's no gun in the house, because it's difficult to acquire, you're not going to use one."I left out the part about bladed weapons due to space . My point in all of this is that it seems doubtful that the Founding Fathers thought that a "Militia" well regulated or otherwise could stand up to a professional army. I remember a scene from the Mel Gibson movie "The Patriot" , Gibson fashions a plan in the climactic battle to place his militia on the front lines. When signaled, they are to turn and run. The British, expecting that this is the usual behavior of militia , are enticed into a trap. The idea that the 2nd Amendment was placed there to make sure that there was another check on government appears to be an orchestrated effort by those that want to believe that. Up until relatively recently, the view was that it was a collectivist right. That is that it was a right granted to local government sanctioned groups. And that notion was pretty convenient because you could believe that and weave it together with the need for protections from the local savages or even local insurrections. But when placed in the context of the times and understanding that Madison's original sanction was for "country" (federal) rather than state challenges one to wonder why the change. The need for these militias to control slaves makes perfect sense and it is more than a passing probability why the language was changed. We didn't become a gun culture because of the 2nd Amendment. I don't mean to suggest that. But we shouldn't justify a gun culture because of it either. That's the trouble with fictions, They are often abused to rationalize behaviors that we want to have but have difficulty justifying. On that I think we can agree."

Zach,The problem is that Greg can only deal with simple, very simple, associations and therefore doesn't understand complex effects, much less unintended consequences. Take his saying that "My point in all of this is that it seems doubtful that the Founding Fathers thought that a 'Militia' well regulated or otherwise could stand up to a professional army."He is so absorbed making his point with mined (from data mining) quotes that he believes make his point, that here he misses even the fact that it was a number of militias or "Militia" that beat a professional army to allow the Founding Fathers their day in court. And that's just one of an almost endless number of examples. It's actually laughable. Or is it all Bogus?

Greg said: "The idea that the 2nd Amendment was placed there to make sure that there was another check on government appears to be an orchestrated effort by those that want to believe that."Zach, you're right. Greg didn't read the fifty or so quotes from the founders I posted a few pages back that indicated that the folks of the Constitution era were all thinking that the second amendment was all about resisting tyranny.Oh well. More proof positive that people do believe what they want to believe rather than believing what the founders intended.Here's one from George Washington. According to Greg he was a raving lunatic. ;-)""Firearms stand next in importance to the constitution itself. They are the American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence … from the hour the Pilgrims landed to the present day, events, occurences and tendencies prove that to ensure peace security and happiness, the rifle and pistol are equally indispensable … the very atmosphere of firearms anywhere restrains evil interference — they deserve a place of honor with all that's good." --George Washington

If your source is correct, than that is indeed an excellent point to make in favor of your argument. However, I have read conflicting research. On a broader scale, Steven Pinker (whom you know well) makes the case that we’re getting progressively less violent as a species:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904106704576583203589408180.htmlThen there’s Randolph Roth, who in his book American Homicide posits that “four factors correlate with the homicide rate: faith that government is stable and capable of enforcing just laws; trust in the integrity of legitimately elected officials; solidarity among social groups based on race, religion, or political affiliation; and confidence that the social hierarchy allows for respect to be earned without recourse to violence. When and where people hold these sentiments, the homicide rate is low; when and where they don’t, it’s high.”That quote is sourced from this article, which begins by supporting your argument, but deviates when it starts to progress:http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/11/09/091109crat_atlarge_leporeNow, America seems to be special in that our homicide rates aren’t declining quite as impressively as those of Europe. Again, I don’t think it’s a hardware problem. Timothy McVeigh had no trouble purchasing the materials he needed for his bomb:“On September 30, 1994, Nichols bought forty 50-pound (23 kg) bags of ammonium nitrate from Mid-Kansas Coop in McPherson, Kansas. This would be enough to fertilize 4.25 acres of farmland at a rate of 160 pounds of nitrogen per acre; an amount commonly used for corn…In October 1994, posing as a motorcycle racer, McVeigh obtained three 55-U.S.-gallon (46 imp gal; 210 L) drums of nitromethane on the pretense that he and some fellow bikers needed the fuel for racing.” (Wikipedia)No, it’s a people problem. America has issues. We also have a wildly heterogeneous society, growing even more diverse every day. That’s something Europe hasn’t had to struggle with as much. If you want to reduce homicide, you must change society. Russia, Mexico, and Venezuela (among many others) have all tried using gun control laws to reduce homicide, and all have failed miserably.

Zach,
From personal experience I can tell you that in those countries that are less crime ridden at least PART of the reason is that people are less trusting and far more cautious. Even in supposedly super safe Japan I had problems but then I noticed that I was the only one around in a vast public place. I find that Americans are more trusting even if increasingly cautious.

XavierYou say that you believe people in America are more trusting even if increasingly cautious.We are more than more trusting, we are in general kinder to one another.As I have said many times, I ride the bus, and I do it in a town with a bad reputation. Though I find it undeserved, because the people are good.One observation I need to make is the amount of times I have seen us uncaring New Yorkers helping carry baby strollers, giving up their seat, or paying the fair if the driver says no to a person with no money and a need.nothings perfect and there are drawbacks, you also meet uncaring pigs.I leave those to Greg or Peter's defense.

Xavier:“Wouldn't the only difference between man and animal be that in man we are able to form complex expressions, i.e. what we call language? We have that additional organ, which I think is what Chomsky is saying, but it is an "organ" no different than and dependant on the others.”Perfect comprehension of the topic (and inherent debate within), so kudos. I would additionally note that the higher animals seem to be capable of very rudimentary language; that is, to share a tribal understanding that a certain noise (might we even call it a phoneme of sorts?) represents a certain object, situation, or other reflection of the environment. This suggests the distinct possibility that these animals are capable of the most rudimentary logical thought processes; indeed, studies have shown that human language is not a prerequisite for human logical thought.

The question occurs about your so called empathy gene. What do you see it as being? An actual gene with s single function, or an "organ" or microchip with hardwired logic circuits that also has logic based software that can process information and produce what are also logic based instructions? Look at how the number of possible outputs or outcomes multiply exponentially as you go from gene to "organ." Yet for empathy to be such don't you have to assume a certain narrow range of outcomes that are desirable?I realize all of this is a great oversimplification with in practice a whole hierarchy of different, oh what to call them?, say microchips ranging from very simple ones with very narrow functions (say a simple calculator) to more complex ones with a larger range of possible actions or outputs (such as a computer). For my purposes, without being or pretending to become a neuroscientist, I am just trying to get a feel for what you are talking about.

Zach,
When you consider more precisely what empathy is and how it works, you may want to take into account the following, which I took from something one of my daughters posted on Facebook.
“Genetically, dogs and wolves are the same species. They are able to hybridize, will happily do so given the opportunity, and the offspring are healthy and fertile. In spite of their genetic similarities, behaviorally speaking they are very different. To tame a wolf is practically impossible. Why this is when they're technically not even a separate species from ‘man's best friend’ has long been a ...puzzle.
“New research suggests it may be down to a slight difference in their socialization period - wolves seem to enter this stage two weeks younger than dogs do, leading to critical differences in how they develop socially.”

Nancy:“With this explanation I still don't see how logic precedes language, but would say that man's ability to use language is an important part of human cognition. From that we can use language to reason and use logic.”I urge you to re-read the paragraph I quoted very closely. Pinker says that “[o]bject terms are natural primary argument terms.” What he means by this is that every word for an object is a specific argument to define that object. An argument is “an attempt to persuade someone of something, by giving reasons or evidence for accepting a particular conclusion.” For example, every time you use the word “banana” in conversation or writing, you are issuing a small argument to your audience that banana refers to that curved yellow fruit. Your argument is based on inductive reasoning (a type of logical thought); you are implicitly saying, “I posit that the word ‘banana’ refers to a curved yellow fruit.” Now, the English language (for example) is a relatively efficient form of communication precisely because—for an argument as simple as an object term—you rarely have to support this argument with inductive premises. In other words, most people will instantly accept your argument and move onto the rest of what you are trying to communicate. That doesn’t mean, however, that the argument isn’t still there. You can see these arguments manifest themselves when people debate the meaning of certain words, in which they must rely on the aforementioned inductive premises to construct a logical argument.As a side note, recent neurological studies suggest that humans do not rely upon language to engage in logical thought.

Zach,I had difficulty understanding the quote you gave me and couldn't look it up since I didn't get page 140. I did notice that it began with "presumably," and I know he was contrasting various theories on the subject. But I finally did find one of Steven Pinker's writings online called, "Language is an Instinct." He writes:"I call language an 'instinct,' an admittedly quaint term for what other cognitive scientists have called a mental organ, a faculty, or a module. Language is a complex, specialized skill, which develops in the child spontaneously without conscious effort or formal instruction, is deployed without awareness of its underlying logic, is qualitatively the same in every individual, and is distinct from more general abilities to process information or behave intelligently. (One corollary is that most of the complexity in language comes from the mind of a child, not from the schools or from grammar books.) All this suggests that language is caused by dedicated circuitry that has evolved in the human brain. It then raises the question of what other aspects of the human intellect are instincts coming from specialized neural circuitry." http://www.scribd.com/doc/932522/PINKER-Language-is-an-Instinct He continues, "One responds to the fact that what people do know about language is often wrong. The view of language that suffuses public discourse — that people assume both in the sciences and in the humanities — is that language is a cultural artifact that was invented at a certain point in history and that gets transmitted to children by the example of role models or by explicit instruction in schools. The corollary is that now that the schools are going to pot and people get their language from rock stars and athletes, language will steadily deteriorate, and if current trends continue we're allgoing to be grunting like Tarzan. I argue instead that language is a human instinct."

Yes, and if you refer to the quote you just provided, you’ll notice that Pinker states that “language is a complex, specialized skill…deployed without awareness of its underlying logic.” The key words in that sentence are, of course, “underlying logic”. Humans don’t have to be aware of a thought process to use it; indeed, relative to the total amount of thoughts we produce on a daily basis, we very rarely make ourselves consciously aware of the thought processes we use. After all, do you constantly think about how you’re thinking what you’re thinking, or do you just think it? When you use language, you make what Pinker calls “primary arguments” for each and every word, only these arguments are so simple and easy to make that you don’t even think of them as arguments. Just like the child in Pinker’s quote, you aren’t aware of the underlying logic behind your language until you actually think about it, such as in this discussion we’re having ;)

However, we recognized the underlying logic of the language use, but our language isn't what it is because we used logic to determine it. It is what it is because it's instinctual, according to Pinker. You're using your learning of logic to explain the thought process we use. The thought process we use was not determined by us, but by our Creator or Evolution, whichever you choose to believe in.Therefore, any primary argument is an observation and labeling of our use of language. It is not the cause of our language ability.

" The thought process we use was not determined by us, but by our Creator or Evolution, whichever you choose to believe in."Bravo, Nancy! The human genome, the term used for the set of information contained in the single strand of DNA in the nucleus of a human cell, contains six billion characters. And as you know, the particular DNA molecule present in each and every one of us is unique to us...but within each of our bodies, the DNA present in every cell is identical DNA. If the DNA molecule present in any one of those microscopic cells was uncoiled and stretched into a straight line, it would span six feet long.According to Greg and Zach, that DNA code happened by accident.I think not.The DNA molecule is responsible for cell regeneration.It is designed to replicate and build an entire human body in the womb, and then throughout our lives, that strand of DNA has all the information necessary, with God's spiritual support, for development throughout the life cycle.The pieces that are not understood from the materialist point of view are exactly the things that God supports in us: the mind, language, love, the notions of art and music appreciation.Zach and the secular materialists continually try to come up with ideas (another spiritual paradigm) to try and pigeonhole the human condition into a naturalistic box, stubbornly denying the possibility of any spiritual component to our existence...but they are not having much success. They don't know what animates us or fills our mind and spirit. God is revealed to us everywhere, but they cannot see Him.Let's wait a while...as I described a few dozen pages back, our best man-made silicon memory chip is about 47 trillion times less effective than the DNA information system designed into the human cell.This microscopic complexity alone is more than a hint from the Creator that there is something bigger going on in our universe. But as we see all too routinely, a billion character message to us located in the nucleus of our own cells is not enough to convince the strident atheist that there is a Creator present in our world.If you want another hint located in microbiology, check out the laminin protein molecule. It is the biological glue that binds the human body together and is the key structural support element for the human brain/nerve cell.You've got to check out this amazing cell! (be sure to read down into the comments of the blog postings that include science guys discussing the importance and sheer amazingness of this cute little building block of human beings.)http://ocapologist.blogspot.com/2010/09/laminin.html"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by him all things were created; things in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things HOLD TOGETHER. " --Colossians 1:15-17

MARIA PERGAY'S
modernist stainless steel sculptures won the Parisian designer high-profile fans in the 1960s and '70s. Everyone from Salvador Dalí
to Pierre Cardin
had a piece of her bold and playful work. Enlarge Image
Maria Pergay
Ed Alcock / M.Y.O.P. After coming out of retirement almost a decade ago, she is once again in high demand. Next month, Ms. Pergay will be exhibiting at Design Miami with the Demisch Danant gallery. She has also collaborated with Fendi to produce a range of pieces, which will be shown at Design Miami. "My pieces are like jewelry," Ms. Pergay says. "People will only have to look at a piece and they will guess it is Maria." I am happiest when I am happy with my myself, where I am feeling more at peace with myself. It can be anywhere, except where it is bloody, where there is hurt. I need kind, peaceful people. My favorite city? In general I love antiques and antiquities. I adore Florence, Paris, Greece, Egypt, where man is close to God. God is the biggest architect. I love Russian literature. There are big masters coming from there, ones that speak the truth. But it can also be Mickey Mouse, Peanuts, or it can be the Bible. Enlarge Image
From left, Cellini's sculpture of Perseus with the head of Medusa in Florence; Christmas baking; adored places—Egypt and Florence
Alamy (4); Getty Images (log, pyramids) It is impossible to have a favorite piece of art—you cannot say that. It is like asking which flower is the best. But one of my favorite artists is Benvenuto Cellini,
and I love Michelangelo.
I made my name with silverware, not just stainless steel. In 1957, [silver] looked like brand new. Then I found it was too weak. I like to make big things, so stainless steel was there. One form from another one. If I wasn't an artist, I think I would write music. I don't read music—I heard a lot but I never know enough. I get completely newborn when I hear my favorite composers. I love classical, the voices are so beautiful. Part of Rossini
when you listen to it is so fantastic; also when you hear Mahler,
you forget everything. Vivaldi,
you are in the sky. I love anything that will make you feel like a human being. The best piece of advice I received was: be always yourself. Even if you are bad, at least you have the truth. I start my day passionate, work with pleasure. I am smiling happy when I jump out of my bed. The best holiday ever was when I went around the world. I had fabulous moments in Afghanistan just before the war in 1976. I saw there only friendship around me. Also, going deep into Russia, the heat in Saudi Arabia. But the word favorite doesn't exist. I just like things. Enlarge Image
'Ring' chair 1968
Courtesy of Demisch Danant. Photo by Thierry Depagne. My phobia is people who are very bad—méchant in French. My favorite fashion designer? In each period there was a fashion, there was something that was new: it popped out, was fabulous and very pure. In each time there is something blooming. I shop at Galleries Lafayette, Printemps. But I also know all the fashion makers, big people—
Karl Lagerfeld
… I love also Gianfranco Ferre, he was magnificent, and the fashions from Dior and YSL. But also new designers must be born and grow up. Restaurants I love—sometimes it is the next door Chinese, other times a superb bistro. If you come in France I will show you where—an atelier, where people are working, a family place often where the grandma is making the cooking, an old-fashioned recipe, so fresh, so good. I don't really have a signature dish. When you have four children you cook for them, then, thank God, they have grown up… They now cook for me. I like making cakes at Christmas, it is holy. I regret not to be able to live again 83 years. But I am not sorry as life is too wonderful, too good. I enjoy myself, which comes from somewhere. Enlarge Image
'Flying Carpet' daybed, 1968
Courtesy of Demisch Danant. Photo by Thierry Depagne. The art I feel most emotional about is my first baby born, my "Flying Carpet" daybed from 1967. I don't have an icon as such but I admire people who support love. My favorite scent, which I cannot forget, is the smell of the snow in Russia. When it falls the sky falls onto the ground. There is no little snow, it is big snow, and smells like a perfume. I cannot say that I miss Russia, but I miss my family, and that nostalgia of the song of the voices, because for me it is the language of my born place. God gives me a fantastic memory. I have very good memory of forms. My advice to the young: Listen to your own feelings, even if you feel like you should listen to the others. Do not be blocked, listen to what makes you feel alive. —Edited from an interview by Jemima Sissons Explore More

GROWER SPIRIT | Anselme Selosse, who runs Jacques Selosse, at his winery
Michel Joly for The Wall Street Journal CHAMPAGNE LOVERS should be grateful to Anselme Selosse, who has inspired a new generation of grape growers to produce their own bubbly rather than sell their grapes to the big, brand-name houses. The proliferation of small grower-made Champagnes, especially from Côte des Blancs, the area of France best suited to Chardonnay grapes, has been the most exciting recent development in Champagne. Grower Champagnes are the indie bands of the world's most famous sparkling-wine region—not necessarily better, but quirkier and more distinctive than the products of the big houses. Mr. Selosse, who runs Champagne house Jacques Selosse (named after his father), wasn't the first small grower to bottle his own wine, but when the influential French wine and restaurant guide Gault & Millau named him the best winemaker in France in 1994, the world took notice, and other growers followed. Oenofile: Five Grower Champagne Grands View Graphics
F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal Blanc de blancs (Champagnes made solely from Chardonnay grapes) from small producers are increasingly available on these shores. Unfortunately, the same can't be said of Mr. Selosse's wines, which are almost impossible to find. In this regard, they resemble their elusive creator, whom I've begun to think of as the J.D. Salinger of the Côte des Blancs. When, on the verge of a visit to France, I called Doug Polaner, Mr. Selosse's U.S. distributor, to ask for an appointment, he said, "Good luck with that. I can't even get in to see him." Mr. Polaner suggested I make a reservation at the Hôtel Les Avisés, a 10-room inn adjacent to the winery owned and operated by Mr. Selosse and his wife, Corinne. "We'll let him know you're coming," Mr. Polaner said. If I made a dinner reservation at the hotel's restaurant, there was a decent chance that the master would stop by during the meal. “
Their bouquet is often compared with brioche, though I'm frequently reminded of Walkers Scottish shortbread. ”
Meanwhile, I asked a judge from France's "Top Chef" as well as a three-star Paris chef to call Mr. Selosse and vouch for me. On a rainy Sunday afternoon, I made my way from the town of Épernay through a green sea of vines to the tiny village of Avize. The hotel, a white neoclassical mansion, is perched amid gardens at the highest point of the village, alongside the less picturesque sheds that house the winery. When I checked in, the young woman at the desk assured me that Mr. Selosse would almost certainly stop by during dinner. My meal was excellent, as was the bottle of 2002 Selosse, an incredibly rich, full-bodied bubbly that had the mellow, oxidative notes of an older Champagne—so powerful it even carried me through the steak. I rationed as long as I could, lingering over cheese, but the chatelain was a no-show. The next morning, as I was checking out, I spotted the man himself, burly and bushy haired, striding across the courtyard between the winery and the hotel. I grabbed a copy of the book I'd been promoting in Paris out of my hand luggage and ran outside to pursue him. "Excusez-moi, Monsieur Selosse!" I knew he was averse to speaking English, so I'd already practiced a little speech declaring that he was featured in the book, which I thrust upon him. He nodded and scuffed his toe in the gravel, then apologized for failing to meet me last night, explaining that some family business had detained him. After an awkward pause, he asked me if I'd like a tour. Off Duty's Half Full

Millennium Punch
F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas The Comforts of Punch Infused Ice Cubes That Really Rock Rums That Don't Need Fruity Mixers Stunt Whiskeys for Armchair Adventurers The winery is on three floors, with presses on the highest level, the juice flowing downward via gravity in each stage of production. The middle level was packed with oak barrels, in which the wines are fermented and aged, allowing an exchange of oxygen that accelerates the maturation process. (Steel tanks are more commonly used in Champagne production.) But really, Mr. Selosse informed me, "It's in the vineyards where the crucial work is done." If this has become a winemaking cliché in recent years, it was certainly news in Champagne in 1974, when Mr. Selosse returned from a stint in Burgundy, where he'd studied at the Lycée Viticole in Beaune, to take over his father's vineyards. At the time, heavy use of fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides were the norm, and high yields of barely ripe grapes were the goal of most growers, since the big houses paid by the ton. Mr. Selosse slashed yields to allow the fruit on the vines to get riper, and reduced the use of chemicals, practicing organic farming. He also started preaching the gospel of terroir, that particularly Burgundian concept that equates a wine's unique identity with its place of origin. The almost universal practice in Champagne was the blending of grapes from all over the region to create a homogenous product. Mr. Selosse's ideas flew in the face of conventional Champagne wisdom. "Selosse was the first to show a grower could make great wines," grower Pierre Larmandier told me later that morning, when I visited him at his winery, Champagne Larmandier-Bernier. The facility was redolent of the fermenting must of recently harvested grapes in the town of Vertus, a few miles down the road from Avize. Mr. Larmandier inherited vineyards in Vertus as well as the grand-cru villages of Cramant and Avize. "Four generations of my family were growers," he said, but older generations sold most of their grapes to the big houses. Inspired in large part by Mr. Selosse, in 1988 Mr. Larmandier started bottling his own production. In 1993 he adopted organic farming practices, which many thought was impossible in the cool, wet climate of Champagne, where mildew is a threat. Like Mr. Selosse, Mr. Larmandier has since moved to the extreme form of organic farming known as biodynamics. He drove me around to see some of his vineyards, showing off the healthy grass between the vines. (His neighbors' soils were naked, seemingly denuded by herbicides.) Mr. Larmandier's Champagnes display a distinct mineral character suggestive of the chalk underlying the vineyards of Côte des Blancs. During my visit, Mr. Selosse described this particular aspect of the best wines of the region, "the true wines of terroir" as "l'eau de roche"—the water of the rock. The wines of both growers, as well as others like Pierre Gimonnet, Pierre Péters and Agrapart & Fils, have a signature that's more stony than fruity. The idea that grapes can express the character of underlying bedrock is unproven, though it's an article of faith in Burgundy, as it is with Mssrs. Selosse and Larmandier. In their defense, the notion of terroir seems empirically borne out when sampling the wines from different villages. The bubblies from Avize taste quite different from similarly made wines from Vertus. The small-grower movement has spread to all corners of Champagne, and many excellent grower bubblies are made with the traditional blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, but I have a particular soft spot for the pure Chardonnay wines of Côte des Blancs. Blanc de blancs Champagnes are particularly zesty and lively in their youth. They also have a great ability to age, acquiring roundness and body as well as a bouquet that's often compared with brioche, though I'm frequently reminded of Walkers Scottish shortbread. I plan to drink plenty of blanc de blancs in the coming year, and while I may not open many bottles of Selosse, I will, from time to time, lift a glass in his general direction.

Updated Oct. 27, 2012 2:46 p.m. ET
New York state officials said that they will decide on Sunday whether to proceed with a shutdown of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in advance of the approaching Hurricane Sandy. Warning of potential high winds and flooding that could trigger a decision to shutter all or part of the system, MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota
said such a move would start at 7 p.m. on Sunday if necessary. On its current course, Sandy appears likely to make landfall south of New York City, which could generate storm surges of 4 to 8 feet and major flooding in low-lying areas of the city and the subway system. The MTA and the state aren't yet ordering a shutdown, but are making preparations for that possibility, and seeking to prompt rail and bus riders to make plans for cuts in service leading into the work week. "Try to be home or be where you need to be at 7 p.m., because there is no guarantee of service after that," Mr. Lhota said in a televised briefing from Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office in Midtown. "We're planning for the worst, we're hoping for the best, and all decisions will be made on this tomorrow," Mr. Lhota said. Patrick Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, said flight operations were continuing as normal at LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark Liberty international airports. But passengers should check with airlines before traveling to the airport as the storm approaches. Major effects of Sandy are expected to begin reaching the New York region Monday morning. State Health Commissioner Nirav Shah said the state has begun a limited evacuation of ventilator-dependent patients in "a few facilities" located in the storm's "slosh zone"—a term connoting "sea, lake and overland surges from hurricanes." The MTA is seeking to avoid a repeat of its shutdown during Hurricane Irene, Mr. Lhota said, adding, "We don't want that to happen." But the agency has no choice but to prepare. In addition to a shutdown of the transit system, which would be called for in the event of a storm with sustained winds of 39 miles per hour or higher, the MTA will call for a slowdown order on its bridges in the event of high winds. Every MTA bridge will be shut down in the event that winds reach 60 miles per hour, Mr. Lhota said.

LAFAYETTE, La. -- Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu says she generally backs President Barack Obama's health-care overhaul efforts. But she'd like to see a few items in the bill before voting for it, including bigger federal Medicaid payments for her home state of Louisiana, extended health coverage for her pet cause of foster children, and help for teaching hospitals in her state. While pushing more spending in those areas, Ms. Landrieu also wants the plan to cut the overall amount the nation spends on health care. On the Table Compare the plans, point-by-point
Health-Care Overhaul Attempts As costs have risen, attempts at change

Washington Wire: What to Watch in House Vote House Democrats Push for Saturday Vote More interactive graphics and photos Video: Another Missed Health Deadline Democrats See Health Timetable Slipping Journal Community Vote: Should the House pass the bill? As Democratic leaders enter the intensive phase of their drive to pass health legislation, they must satisfy 60 Mary Landrieus in the Senate -- every Democrat and the two Democratic-friendly independents, each with individual priorities -- as they try to hold together a fragile coalition with no room for error. And that has only become more complicated as Democrats from conservative states puzzle over what to make of Republican victories Tuesday in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. Senators' needs vary greatly, and sometimes contradict each other. Sen. Evan Bayh (D., Ind.) is a big supporter of medical-device makers in Indiana, and he signed a letter declaring himself "extremely concerned" about a proposed tax on the industry. Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D., Ark.), facing a tough re-election contest next year, would like to tackle the shortage of health providers in rural areas. Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) is pushing a tax break for investments in start-up biotechnology firms, earning him plaudits from his state's burgeoning biotech industry. Dozens of other senators have their own priorities. Beyond that, Democrats from conservative states are under particular pressure to show their voters the health bill is not too expensive, won't create a vast bureaucracy, and will help business. Majority Leader Harry Reid's decision to include a government-run competitor to private insurers -- commonly dubbed "the public option" -- greatly intensifies the pressure to satisfy all 58 Democrats and two independents in the Senate, since it is now unlikely any Republicans will support the bill. Sixty votes are needed to block a filibuster and bring the bill to the Senate floor, though if that obstacle is overcome and the bill comes up for a vote, passage will require only a simple majority of 51.

Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu at a health-insurance news conference Tuesday.
Getty Images It may take special concessions to keep on board a handful of Democrats uneasy with the "public option," like Ms. Landrieu. The senator, a member of a venerable Louisiana political family who has a quiet, matter-of-fact style, faces constant peril as a Democrat in a conservative state. Republican presidential candidate John McCain won Louisiana with 59% of the vote. Louisiana Democrats lost loyal voters when Hurricane Katrina drove away thousands of residents in 2005, many of them African-American and poor. Ms. Landrieu, 53 years old, won her first Senate election in 1996 in a runoff, prevailing by about 6,000 votes out of 1.7 million cast. In 2008, she was widely considered the most vulnerable Senate Democrat, and in a heavily Democratic year she garnered 52% of the vote. Along the way, she has become expert at walking a delicate line, a trait on full display as she navigates what could be the most important vote of her career. Ms. Landrieu sprinkles her sentences with "generally," giving her wiggle room, as in, "Generally, I'm just not in favor of a public option." In a tribute to her balancing act, she is one of the few politicians in America to be endorsed by both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. Detractors see in that deftness a willingness to change her message depending on the audience. "She's laid out a clear stand saying she doesn't want a public option, but she's also said she's willing to compromise," said Aaron Baer, spokesman for the Louisiana Republican Party. "Here in the state, she's strongly against the public option; when she's back in D.C., it's all about how she's still working on a compromise." A spokesman for Ms. Landrieu declined to comment on that criticism. A recent forum at the Clifton Chenier community center in Lafayette illustrated her challenge. About 100 conservative protesters gathered outside, carrying signs reading, "No Mary No" and "Wake up Mary -- vote no!" A "Don't Tread on Me" flag flew from a nearby trailer. When Ms. Landrieu showed up, she surprised the protesters by wading into their midst. One called out, "If cloture is needed, would you vote for or against it?" referring to a move to block a filibuster. She replied, "It depends what's in the bill," prompting a collective "Ohhh" of disgust. The protesters appeared split over whether to shout the senator down or hear her out. When one yelled, "This is about [government] control!" another responded, "Let her talk!" As Ms. Landrieu walked away, the crowd broke into a chant of "Kill the bill!" John Estabrooks, a beret-clad local leader of the "tea party" movement, a group of anti-big-government activists, climbed onto a makeshift stage and told the crowd: "If Mary fails us, we will vote her out." Medicare is now on the verge of collapse. Same thing will happen to everyone's insurance if this bill passes. — Michael Landskroner
Inside, there was more support for the health overhaul. But Adam Mouton, 67, a retired Army officer clutching an American flag, asked Ms. Landrieu why Congress was changing the entire health system when only parts were broken. "You do agree that we have the best health-care system in the world?" he demanded. Ms. Landrieu responded cautiously that the U.S. spends the most on health care but several countries boast better outcomes, prompting Mr. Mouton to shout, "Name one!" Ms. Landrieu said at first she was not sure, then named Sweden, and added hastily, "But I'm not for the Swedish system. I'm for our system." The U.S. Chamber of Commerce ran four ads in Louisiana and is mounting a campaign that claims to have attracted 13,000 signatures against "government-run" health care. A "Hands Off My Health Care" bus tour sponsored by the conservative Americans for Prosperity hit eight Louisiana cities in August. AFL-CIO officials lobbied Ms. Landrieu recently in her office to back the public option. Democratic leaders are keenly aware of these pressures and of their need to keep Ms. Landrieu in the fold. Senate Majority Leader Reid's first challenge is to win a vote to begin Senate consideration of the health bill. If that succeeds, it will set off a weeks-long debate, featuring numerous amendments and a good deal of horse-trading, culminating in a vote on passage of the bill. Enlarge Image
Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.), left, and Sen. Landrieu (D. La.) at a Senate hearing in June; both face votes soon on a health-care overhaul.
Associated Press Ms. Landrieu has faced such pressure for months. A group called Conservatives for Patients' Rights, which opposes a public option, aired ads in Louisiana featuring a bow-tied government bureaucrat standing between a patient and her kindly doctor. Ads from liberal MoveOn.org, which favors a public option, show a breast-cancer survivor from New Orleans asking Ms. Landrieu, "Whose side are you on?" Mr. Reid has cautioned that there is a long way to go and wary senators may come around. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) predicts Mr. Reid will have difficulty persuading moderate Democrats. "I think the majority leader's probably having a challenging time trying to convince his members to go to a bill that cuts Medicare half a trillion dollars, raises taxes $400 billion, and raises insurance premiums," Mr. McConnell said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) faces a daunting task of her own in holding together a majority for the overhaul. If both chambers approve their health bills, a conference committee will merge them, and then the Senate and House must vote separately on final passage. If that happens, Republican leaders may face their own challenge keeping their troops in line. Some Democrats predict that at least a handful of GOP members won't want to be seen as standing in the way of a historic expansion of health coverage. But the Democrats' quest is a treacherous one that could collapse at any moment, and Ms. Landrieu's importance to it is not lost on Democratic leaders. Mr. Reid met privately with her on Oct. 23, and she told him she had serious concerns about the public option but hoped for a quick compromise so the debate could move to other issues. Mr. Obama invited Ms. Landrieu to the Oval Office to sound her out, and he held a separate session with all of the Senate centrists. Ms. Landrieu has been gathering with these moderates a half-dozen times a week, in senators' offices and even hallways, to discuss impressions and ideas for health care. "It's sort of a gaggle, you know?" Ms. Landrieu said. "But we stay in touch with each other." The public option has been among the most contentious issues in the health-care debate, with critics complaining that a government-run insurer would compete unfairly with private insurers. In an attempted compromise between liberals and moderates, Mr. Reid's version of the public option would allow states to opt out if they chose. Ms. Landrieu's position on the public option depends on its final form; she suggests she would support a "fallback" under which it would kick in only if private insurers couldn't meet patients' needs. "I don't favor a government-run national public option," Ms. Landrieu said in a recent interview. "I could be open to either a fallback or a public option that plays on the same playing field as private business....Something like that I could maybe consider if it meant a deal at the end." Other concerns are tied more directly to her home state. About 20% of Louisiana's adults lack health insurance and 25% of its population is on Medicaid. Louisiana officials complain that federal and insurance money that poured into the state after Katrina artificially pumped up its reported income levels, requiring the state to pay a higher share of Medicaid costs. It's "a big, big problem for us in the state," said John Matessino, president of the Louisiana Hospital Association. "If it's not fixed, we could have a billion-dollar hole in the Medicaid program, and I don't even know how you run a Medicaid program at that point." Altering that formula is one of Ms. Landrieu's goals, one she raised directly with Mr. Reid when they met. Some of her aims are more personal. Her husband, Frank Snellings, and their two children, Connor and Mary Shannon, are all adoptees, and she has made adoption and foster care a top cause. She wants to provide health coverage through age 24 for anyone who has been in foster care at least six months. "This is sort of a special issue for me," Ms. Landrieu said. Her staff said it can't calculate the provision's cost or number of people affected because some move in and out of the foster-care system and many are covered by other programs such as Medicaid. Ms. Landrieu also heads the Senate's small-business committee, and her support of small business is a key way she has burnished her centrist credentials. In the health-care bill, Ms. Landrieu is pushing for small businesses to have access to a comprehensive health-insurance exchange, like the one some individuals would use. Louisiana political analysts say Ms. Landrieu can survive politically, even if many of her constituents dislike the health bill, so long as they believe she helped make it more conservative. "Anything that is even halfway as far as Obama wants to go will be too far for the average Louisiana voter," said Brian Brox, a political scientist at Tulane University. "I don't think there is a 'yes' vote that is not damaging for her. But if it doesn't have big government intervention or taxpayer funding of abortion, that is not as damaging."

For Segundo Baldovino, the decision to become an entrepreneur last year was a no-brainer. The hard part was choosing what type of business to launch. Mr. Baldovino was laid off in January 2009 from a management position at Ford Motor in Detroit. After several months of job hunting, he determined that his best option for working again would be to start his own company. But he only knew what industry he didn't want to pursue: the one he had just come from. Segundo Baldovino, left, and Marty Navarra purchased a Senior ComforCare Services franchise in St. Claire Shores, Mich., in October.
Segundo Baldovino "I said to myself, I got to do something. I have a family to feed, a mortgage to pay," Mr. Baldovino recalls. But "I didn't know what kind of business I wanted to get into." You Have to Love It Choosing a business to pursue is always a challenge -- and it's especially so when you need to act fast. Some people might feel most comfortable sticking with an industry or field they've already worked in, while others may be inclined to try something new. Regardless, there are several factors to consider, including start-up costs and the amount of competition a business category entails, but experts say one of the most important is choosing a path that will keep you motivated for the long haul. "Passion is critical because it will get you up each morning," says Nancy F. Koehn, an entrepreneurial historian at Harvard Business School. "If you don't love what you're doing at the beginning, you're going to be in real trouble." Last July, Lucinda Sierra turned her six-year-old hobby of making themed cakes out of small chocolates into the Little Candy Cake Company. She says she opted to try her hand at entrepreneurship after she broke her foot and was forced to put her job as a freelance costume designer on ice. "I never set out to have my own company," says Ms. Sierra. "Life just pushed me into it." At first, Ms. Sierra was concerned about whether anyone would actually buy her custom candy cakes. To test the waters, she put four cakes for sale on Etsy.com, an online crafts marketplace with 4.4 million members. Within less than a month, she secured an order for 150 cakes. These days, Ms. Sierra averages five orders per month for a total of around 1,000 cakes through Etsy, her company's Web site or referrals. She charges between $4 and $20 per cake, depending on their size. She has three employees -- her mother, husband and niece -- and recently signed a six-month lease for retail space at Limelight Marketplace, a new bazaar opening in Manhattan this week. "I absolutely love doing this," she says. Proven Approach Aspiring entrepreneurs who don't have a long-brewing idea or hobby to propel into a business can always turn to an already-proven model: a franchise. In October, Mr. Baldovino, the former auto-industry worker, and his brother-in-law, Marty Navarra, purchased a Senior ComforCare Services franchise in St. Claire Shores, Mich. Today, they have six customers and 16 employees. Mr. Baldovino says he liked the ComforCare franchise because it provides the kind of personalized service he'd want for his mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, if his father wasn't alive to care for her. "If I did it alone," he says, "I'd be starting from scratch." Write to Sarah E. Needleman at sarah.needleman@wsj.com Email
