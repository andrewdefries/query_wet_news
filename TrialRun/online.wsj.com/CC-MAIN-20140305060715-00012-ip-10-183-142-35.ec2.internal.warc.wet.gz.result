Biography
Updated April 2, 2013 3:13 p.m. ET
New York state Sen. Malcolm Smith
tried to buy entry onto the New York City mayoral ballot by orchestrating bribes to Republican leaders, federal prosecutors charged Tuesday as they revealed details of a wide-ranging corruption probe that also ensnared a Queens council member and four others. The criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday alleges a web of illegal activity connecting bribes on behalf of Mr. Smith's political ambitions to an upstate real-estate transaction and the use of state and New York City Council discretionary funds. The 28-page document reads like a film-noir screenplay, with investigators at one point detailing an attempt by a defendant to frisk an undercover agent before allegedly accepting a $25,000 bribe. The charges sent reverberations across the New York political world, with tremors felt inside Democratic and Republican mayoral campaigns and in the state Senate leadership. Malcolm A. Smith after being arraigned
Peter Foley for The Wall Street Journal Aside from Mr. Smith, a Democrat from Queens, federal agents arrested: New York City Council Member Dan Halloran,
a Republican from Queens; Vincent Tabone,
vice chairman of the Queens County Republican Party; Joseph Savino,
chairman of the Bronx Republican Party; Noramie Jasmin,
mayor of Spring Valley, N.Y.; and Joseph Desmaret,
deputy mayor of the same village. The defendants later appeared in federal court in White Plains, where Judge Lisa Margaret Smith set bail at $250,000 for each of them. Mr. Halloran was ordered to surrender two shotguns, one of which was seized by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents earlier. Gerald Shargel, a lawyer for the 56-year-old Mr. Smith, said his client would plead not guilty if indicted. "The allegations in this complaint do not tell the whole story," Mr. Shargel told reporters outside the courthouse. Enlarge Image

Reuters Lawyers for the other five defendants said their clients would likewise deny the charges in the criminal complaint. "It seems to be that they are trying to make the business of politics as usual into a crime," said Vito Palmieri, attorney for Mr. Tabone, 46. Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the investigation had exposed "once again that a show-me-the-money culture completely pervades every level of New York government." All told, the complaint claims that about $130,000 in bribes changed hands or was promised during secret encounters at hotels and inside parked cars. From the Investigation Metropolis: Key Quotes From the Complaint Read the full complaint against New York State Sen. Malcolm Smith, City Council Member Dan Halloran and four other political leaders. A Democrat throughout his political career in southeast Queens, Mr. Smith explored the possibility of running for mayor this year on the Republican line. To be eligible for the nomination without party membership, he needed a special waiver from leaders of three of the city's five county-level Republican organizations. Such waivers aren't uncommon in New York City politics. Mayor Michael Bloomberg dropped his Republican affiliation in 2007, and then secured permission from party leaders to run on the GOP line for his 2009 re-election. Enlarge Image

Associated Press In his attempt to secure the waiver, Mr. Smith enlisted the help of two men he believed to be wealthy developers, the complaint alleged. In fact, one was a developer cooperating with the FBI and the other was an undercover FBI agent. Prosecutors allege that those men paid Mr. Halloran, 42, more than $20,000 in cash to act as an intermediary with the two GOP officials, and $40,000 in total to Messrs. Tabone and Savino, 45, to support a waiver. If Mr. Smith had been elected mayor, the complaint alleged that Mr. Halloran expected to be appointed as a deputy police commissioner or a deputy mayor. In one recorded conversation described in the complaint, Mr. Smith allegedly said that access to the Republican ballot was well worth the tens of thousands of dollars it would cost in bribes. Related Bharara Sees 'Pervasive' Corruption Arrests Affect Many Layers Of Politics Smith Stripped of Committee Assignments in Wake of Arrest Quotes From the Bribery Complaint: 'It's All About How Much Video: New York Senator, Councilman Arrested in FBI Probe "Look, talk to me before you close it," Mr. Smith is quoted as telling an unnamed witness who cooperated with the FBI probe. "But it's worth it," Mr. Smith allegedly said of the bribes. "Because you know how big a deal it is." The complaint also quotes Mr. Smith allegedly instructing an undercover agent on what would need to happen before one Republican leader would receive "even a nickel more." The party official would "have to stand on the Empire State Building and drop every person [he] endorsed [for mayor] and hold Malcolm up and say he's the best thing since sliced bread. Matter of fact, he's better than sliced bread," Mr. Smith said, according to the complaint. Enlarge Image

Peter Foley for The Wall Street Journal While Mr. Smith eventually met with Republican leaders, there appeared to be little support for granting the necessary waiver. Mr. Savino, the Bronx GOP leader, had signaled support for mayoral hopeful Adolfo Carrión Jr. before switching and endorsing former transit chief Joseph Lhota,
the current front-runner in the race for the Republican mayoral nomination. At the time he endorsed Mr. Lhota, however, Mr. Savino told The Wall Street Journal he wouldn't rule out the possibility of allowing non-Republican mayoral candidates to compete in the party primary. Enlarge Image
Daniel J. Halloran after being arraigned
Peter Foley for The Wall Street Journal In February, an undercover FBI agent asked Mr. Tabone whether he could deliver the waiver for Mr. Smith to run in the primary. "I run the Queens County Republican Party. Nobody else runs the party," Mr. Tabone told the agent, according to the complaint. During that conversation, the complaint describes Mr. Tabone frisking the undercover agent in an apparent search for a recording device. Later that evening, Mr. Tabone allegedly received $25,000 from the agent. In addition to Mr. Halloran's alleged role in Mr. Smith's ballot quest, prosecutors claim Mr. Halloran took more than $24,000 in cash and illegal campaign contributions in exchange for steering up to $80,000 in City Council discretionary funds to a fake company he believed was controlled by the cooperating witness and the undercover agent. Mr. Halloran, a lawyer from Queens, is one of just four Republican lawmakers elected to the council. Enlarge Image

Peter Foley for The Wall Street Journal "That's politics, that's politics, it's all about how much," Mr. Halloran allegedly said in a recorded conversation cited in the complaint. "You can't do anything without the f—money." In a third prong of the investigation, Ms. Jasmin and Mr. Desmaret, mayor and deputy mayor, respectively, of Spring Valley are accused of taking bribes to rig a real-estate deal in the small upstate village of about 30,000 people. The complaint cites a recorded conversation last year in which the unnamed cooperating witness allegedly discusses bribes with Ms. Jasmin, 49, and Mr. Desmaret, 55. Those conversations occurred months before the same witness allegedly began paying bribes to Mr. Halloran. At issue was a community center for the Rockland County village, located about 30 miles from Manhattan. Mr. Smith had promised to steer $500,000 in state money to help finance a road that would benefit the project, federal prosecutors charged. New York State Sen. Malcolm Smith and City Council Member Dan Halloran were arrested in connection with a plot to tamper with the mayoral race. Michael Saul reports. Photo: Getty Images.
The witness and Ms. Jasmin allegedly struck a deal that would give her a hidden interest in a venture that would buy land from the village and build the center, according to the complaint. The witness and an undercover agent also allegedly paid Mr. Desmaret $10,500 to vote in favor of the project. Mr. Smith, a former Democratic leader in the state Senate, late last year joined a breakaway faction of lawmakers known as the Independent Democratic Conference. That group, led by state Sen. Jeffrey Klein, now has a power-sharing arrangement with state Sen. Dean Skelos, a Republican, in which Messrs. Klein and Skelos serve as co-leaders of the majority coalition. Mr. Klein on Tuesday said he would strip Mr. Smith of his committee assignments and conference leadership position. Mr. Skelos said he supported that decision. —Pervaiz Shallwani, Erica Orden and Joe Jackson contributed to this article.

Pressure Mounts on Hong Kong Leader
By
Te-Ping Chen And Chester Yung Updated Jan. 8, 2013 3:31 p.m. ET
Hong Kong's political divide widened this week with an attempt by pro-democracy legislators to impeach the city's Beijing-backed leader, another indication of the difficult relationship between mainland China and the former British colony. The city's first impeachment effort, one even its backers consider largely symbolic, is the latest in a string of protests against Leung Chun-ying, who became chief executive in July after being...

Biography
September 19, 2013
The Washington Post is credited with exposing the Watergate conspiracy and helping to bring down a corrupt presidency. Forty years later, the Post played a role in the corruption of the Internal Revenue Service, to the benefit of an incumbent president in a bitter and close re-election. A staff memo released earlier this week by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee provides an "interim update" on the investigation of the IRS scandal. A central finding: "Media attention caused the IRS to treat conservative-oriented tax-exempt applications differently" from liberal or progressive ones. The memo presents no evidence that the White House directly ordered the IRS to crack down on political opponents. Instead, it is consistent with the theory, described here in May, that IRS personnel responded to "dog whistles" (in Peggy Noonan's metaphor) in public statements from the president and his supporters. In a passage we've annotated with links, the memo describes the media "drumbeat" in early 2010, when the IRS first began turning its attention to the Tea Party: Washington Post columnists accused Tea Party groups of "smolder[ing] with anger" [Colbert King] and practicing a brand of patriotism reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan [Courtland Milloy]. Another Post columnist opined in late March 2010 that Tea Party rhetoric "is calibrated not to inform but to incite" [Eugene Robinson]. In April 2010, Reuters tied the Tea Party movement to "America's season of rage and fear." Contrary to initial claims that the Tea Party targeting was a product of rogue employees in the IRS's Cincinnati office, the Oversight Committee memo shows that as early as February 2010, Cincinnati employees were flagging Tea Party applications for Washington's attention, and their stated motive was media interest: The potential for media attention continued to be a concern for IRS officials once Washington received additional sample cases in late March 2010. Upon receiving the cases in Washington, an IRS employee reviewing the application reiterated that "[t]he concern is potential for media attention." Around the same time that the Washington Post was running columns critical of the Tea Party, she added that "[t]he Tea Party movement is covered in the Post almost daily. I expect to see more applications." "Other IRS employees also monitored news about conservative-leaning groups applying for tax exemption," according to the memo: In March 2012, a line attorney in the IRS Chief Counsel's office circulated a New York Times editorial entitled "The I.R.S. Does Its Job" to three colleagues. The first sentence of the editorial read: "Taxpayers should be encouraged by complaints from Tea Party chapters applying for nonprofit tax status at being asked by the Internal Revenue Service to prove they are 'social welfare' organizations and not the political activities they so obviously are." In May we faulted the Times for "cheering on the IRS" as it abused its power. Now we have confirmation that the IRS got the message. The memo presents evidence that the IRS used an ideologically biased definition of what constitutes a "social welfare" organization, citing this testimony from a Cincinnati IRS employee (which we quote verbatim from the memo): Normal (c)(4) cases we must develop the concept of social welfare, such as the community newspapers, or the poor, that types. These [Tea Party] organizations mostly concentrate their activities on the limiting government, limiting government role, or reducing government size, or paying less tax. I think it[']s different from the other social welfare organizations which are (c)(4). The reference is to Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, which defines a type of nonprofit organization whose operations are tax-exempt but whose contributions are not. The memo also notes striking similarities between President Obama's and Lois Lerner's rhetoric in the wake of Justice Anthony Kennedy's landmark January 2010 First Amendment ruling, Citizens United v. FEC. Here's Obama in an August 2010 speech: Right now all around this country there are groups with harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity, who are running millions of dollars of ads against Democratic candidates all across the country. And they don't have to say who exactly the Americans for Prosperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation. You don't know if it's a big oil company, or a big bank. You don't know if it's a insurance [sic] company that wants to see some of the provisions in health reform repealed because it's good for their bottom line, even if it's not good for the American people. Note that Obama did not even attempt to conceal the partisan and ideological nature of his concern. His worry was about substance, not process--about "ads against Democratic candidates" and in support of industries he chose to demonize. Now, here's Lerner in an October 2010 speech at Duke University: What happened last year [sic; actually earlier the same year] was the Supreme Court--the law keeps getting chipped away in the federal election arena. The Supreme Court dealt a huge blow, overturning a 100-year-old precedent that said basically corporations couldn't give directly to political campaigns. And everyone is up in arms because they don't like it. The Federal Election Commission can't do anything about it. They want the IRS to fix the problem. The IRS laws are not set up to fix the problem. (c)(4)s can do straight political activity. They can go out and pay for an ad that says, "Vote for Joe Blow." That's something they can do as long as their primary activity is their (c)(4) activity, which is social welfare. So everybody is screaming at us right now: "Fix it now before the election. Can't you see how much these people are spending?" I won't know until I look at their 990s next year whether they have done more than their primary activity as political or not. So I can't do anything right now. Lerner's description of the Citizens United decision is grossly inaccurate. It did not overturn any century-old precedent, but a pair of more recent ones, the older of which, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, was decided in 1990. And it left standing the ban on corporate donations to federal campaigns. What it protects is independent speech about campaigns. These errors are telling, because they track closely with Obama's false description of Citizens United in his 2010 State of the Union address: With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests--including foreign corporations--to spend without limit in our elections. I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. Perhaps even more telling is Lerner's lament that "everybody is screaming at us right now." Not only did she hear the dog whistle, but she apparently was unable to identify it as emanating from a partisan source. Obama, congressional Democrats and the liberal media were the only voices Lerner was capable of hearing. Obama backers seeking to minimize the IRS scandal frequently claim that the agency scrutinized progressive groups, too. The Oversight Committee memo powerfully rebuts this claim with a specific example: From 2004 to 2008, the IRS evaluated and approved five applications from affiliates of the progressive-oriented group, Emerge America, which describes itself as "the premier training program for Democratic women." According to one IRS employee, some of these five applications were approved by Cincinnati employees in a "matter of hours." Later, in 2010, the IRS Chief Counsel's office evaluated another progressive application, described by an IRS employee as "a (c)(4) that was going to be training women to become candidates" for the Democratic Party. The same employee testified that at the time, the IRS had "two or three other applications" from affiliated groups. However, there are several distinctions between the manner in which the IRS evaluated Emerge America applications and the manner in which the IRS evaluated conservative-oriented applications. According to testimony from an IRS attorney in the Chief Counsel's office, tax law specialists in EO [Exempt Organizations] Technical had recommended denying the Emerge application before the case was sent to the IRS Chief Counsel's office in 2010. The Chief Counsel's office agreed with the recommended denial, and the application was subsequently denied in early 2011. Conversely, three tax law specialists who worked a conservative (c)(4) application in 2011 all separately recommended approving the group for exempt status. Despite the proposed approval from three different IRS employees, the case was nonetheless sent to the IRS Chief Counsel's office, which asked the tax law specialists to gather additional information about the group's activities during the 2010 election cycle. To the best of the Committee's information, this application is still pending. From this account, it appears that the IRS was more skeptical of Emerge, the left-wing group, in 2010-11 than it had been during the Bush administration. To that extent it runs counter to the IRS scandal narrative. Enlarge Image
It's hard to disagree.
Associated Press But only to that extent. The Emerge application was disapproved on the professional recommendation of IRS legal experts. The conservative groups' applications were delayed despite the professional recommendation of those same experts. If this example is typical, the only progressive groups whose applications were denied were those that should have been, while conservative groups that should have been approved instead were delayed until the 2012 election and beyond. So it seems that the IRS came up with a way to "fix the problem," as Lerner put it, in time for 2012, even if not 2010. In this context, consider the following Sept. 9 report from Investor's Business Daily: Top officials with both the IRS and Justice Department--including the IRS commissioner and attorney general--met in Washington with several dozen prominent black church ministers representing millions of voters to brief them on how to get their flocks out to vote without breaking federal tax laws. The "summit" on energizing the black vote in houses of worship was hosted by the Democrat-controlled Congressional Black Caucus inside the U.S. Capitol on May 30, 2012. The day before the special IRS training session, then-Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Emanuel Cleaver predicted Obama would get 95% of the African-American vote--but only if black pastors "encourage" them to get to the polls. (He ended up getting over 93% of the black vote.) The CBC summit is not mentioned in the Oversight Committee memo, and it isn't clear if it is part of the investigation. Considered in isolation, it isn't even objectionable. There's nothing wrong with a law-enforcement agency advising citizens on how to comply with the law. But the pattern of favoritism--with the IRS taking a helpful attitude toward supporters of the president and an adversarial one toward opponents--is cause for alarm and outrage. As we have argued before, Barack Obama's re-election deserves to be listed with an asterisk in the record books. He is the political equivalent of an athlete found to have used illicit performance-enhancing drugs. Whether he would have won in 2012 absent the IRS's political corruption is unknowable. We know only that he did win with the help of a corrupt IRS. And if indeed the election was stolen, many in the media were complicit in its theft. Fox Butterfield, Is That You? "At the California State University system, the largest university complex in the world, well under 20 percent of students graduate in four years despite massive student aid."--Victor Davis Hanson, National Review Online, Sept. 19 Homer Nods Contrary to an assertion in yesterday's column, the policy that forbids most U.S. military servicemen from carrying firearms on base did not originate in the Clinton administration. Rather, according to TheBlaze.com, it was the Bush administration--the first one--in a February 1992 Defense Department directive. And the Washington Times's Emily Miller reports that the New York Times's characterization of Virginia law, which we repeated, was inaccurate. There is no state law prohibiting nonresidents from purchasing AR-15 rifles.

Times opinion columnists David Brooks, Gail Collins and Ross Douthat also attended, but editors for the paper's news pages did not. The meeting came amid the White House's push for military intervention in Syria, one of the topics discussed that day. The Times editorial board hadn't explicitly come out for or against a strike on Syrian President Bashar Assad before the meeting, and soon after the paper still expressed concerns about the administration taking action without congressional approval and broad international support. Actually, though, if you read on you find that the Times's editorial positions on Syria were confused and conflicted both before the meeting and after the meeting. Which raises a chicken-and-egg question: Did Obama cause the Times's confusion, or the other way around? Meanwhile, yesterday in a blog post Rosenthal faulted the Russian president for what the headline calls "Putin's Dubious Opinion"--which was published, as you may recall, on the op-ed page of the Times: President Vladimir Putin of Russia said in an Op-Ed article that we published last week that "there is every reason to believe" that the chemical weapons attack in Syria on Aug. 21 was carried out by the rebel forces in a crafty plan to provoke the United States into bombing Syria and unleashing all kinds of mayhem. In an article that contained many lines that irritated our readers, that sentence was perhaps the most annoying. . . . This information, of course, has not altered the Russians' public position. They've been putting out a wacky tale of a rebel mole who infiltrated the Republican Guard to fire off the weapons, and putting out tweets pointing to discredited YouTube videos that claim to show that the government did not launch the attack. It's pretty amazing, by the way, that Kremlin propagandists use Twitter and cite YouTube videos. Not to mention New York Times op-eds! Follow @jamestaranto on Twitter.

Dora the Explorer may be saying adios to Netflix. But that could actually end up being a good thing for Viacom. Netflix said last week it would allow its broad contract with Viacom for shows from Nickelodeon, BET and MTV to expire in May. This seems consistent with its recent strategy. The Internet-video company has been saying it will drop content that doesn't generate enough engagement. Viacom's content may also be less...

Biography
May 10, 2013
In September 1989 the New York Times magazine published an excerpt of "The IRS: A Law Unto Itself," a book by former Times reporter David Burnham. Burnham detailed how the Internal Revenue Service had misused its power in an attempt to stifle political dissent: During the Johnson and Nixon Administrations, the focus of the I.R.S.'s effort at political control was individuals and organizations demonstrating for civil rights and against the American presence in Vietnam. . . . On June 16, 1969, Randolph W. Thrower, I.R.S. Commissioner during the Nixon Administration, wrote a memorandum for the record about a meeting he had had that day with Arthur F. Burns, then counselor to the President. According to Thrower, Burns said that Richard M. Nixon was concerned ''over the fact that tax-exempt funds may be supporting activist groups engaged in stimulating riots both on the campus and within our inner cities.'' In December 1973, Judge Charles Richey handed down a decision in which he "formally reprimanded" the agency for "engaging in political manipulations" in denying nonprofit status to a left-wing outfit called the Project on Corporate Responsibility: ''A showing of political influence renders the Service's ruling null and void,'' Judge Richey wrote. ''It is outside the law. The court is concerned not only with direct political intervention, but also with the creation of a political atmosphere generated by the White House in the Internal Revenue Service which may have affected the objectivity of those participating in the ruling in the plaintiff's case.'' Fast-forward four decades, and we have this story from the Washington Post: The Internal Revenue Service on Friday said that it inappropriately selected tea party political groups for special scrutiny in the 2012 campaign. . . . The IRS official who oversees tax-exempt groups, Lois Lerner, acknowledged at a conference on Friday the actions were wrong and apologized, according to the Associated Press. Lerner said groups with the words "tea party" or "patriot" in their applications for tax-exempt status faced additional screening. In a statement, the IRS said the screening occurred by career employees in Cincinnati who, between 2010 and 2012, were seeking to centralize work related to tax exempt organizations. The agency said that while it made errors, they were not politically motivated. The groups in question were applying for status as 501(c)(4) nonprofit "social welfare" corporations. A 501(c)(4)'s operations are tax-exempt, but its contributions, unlike those of a 501(c)(3) charity, are not. Other famous examples of 501(c)(4)s are Organizing for Action, the reconstituted Obama campaign, and Citizens United, victor in the famous 2010 Supreme Court case affirming that the government may not engage in censorship merely because speech is delivered via a corporation. Enlarge Image
Corbis The free-speech rights of 501(c)(4)s, however, are not absolute. Although Citizens United freed them from regulation by the Federal Election Commission, the IRS may withhold tax-exempt status if they engage in too much political activity, or if such activity is not germane to the ostensible social-welfare mission. The rules are vague and easy to get around. In an investigative report last August, ProPublica.org found "that dozens of these groups do little or nothing to justify the [imputed] subsidies they receive from taxpayers. Instead, they are pouring much of their resources, directly or indirectly, into political races at the local, state and federal level." Last year, the Post notes, "Tea Party groups complained . . . that they were receiving dozens of questionnaires from the IRS with regard to their applications for nonprofit tax status, probing their political leanings and activities." That prompted an editorial from the New York Times cheering on the IRS: "Taxpayers should be encouraged by complaints from Tea Party chapters applying for nonprofit tax status at being asked by the Internal Revenue Service to prove they are 'social welfare' organizations and not the political activists they so obviously are." The Times did say the rules "should be applied across the board," and the list of groups it wanted investigated included Priorities USA, a pro-Obama group, as well as a couple of conservative groups and Americans Elect, the failed third-party effort. But the IRS now acknowledges that Tea Party people were right: The agency was investigating them because of their political profile. Viewpoint-based selective enforcement of IRS regulations would be a First Amendment violation even if the regulations themselves are constitutional. It is difficult to credit Lois Lerner's claim that this was merely an error and not politically motivated. Imagine if the NAACP and the United Negro College Fund got hit with this sort of treatment and the IRS denied a racial motive while acknowledging it had deliberately chosen groups whose names contained synonyms for "black." Commentary editor John Podhoretz offers a first-person perspective: I know something about the chilling effect of an IRS investigation into a non-profit's 501 (c)-3 status because in 2009, Commentary (a non-profit) received a letter from the Internal Revenue Service threatening the revocation of the institution's standing as a non-profit due to a claim that on our website we had crossed the line in the 2008 election from analysis to explicit advocacy of the candidacy of John McCain for president. (Non-profits are not permitted to endorse candidates.) The charge was false--all we had done was reprint a speech delivered at a Commentary event by then-Sen. Joseph Lieberman in which he had endorsed McCain. Disproving the charge, Podhoretz writes, required "literally printing out the 2 million words that had appeared on this site in 2008 and sending them in many boxes to the IRS" to show that the Lieberman speech was "essentially a part per million" of Commentary's output. Podhoretz concludes: I had assumed that a hostile reader or hostile liberal group was responsible for the IRS inquiry into Commentary, but there is a salient detail in today's story that makes me think something else might have been at work. IRS official Lerner said the effort against the conservative groups in 2012 came from "low-level" officials in the Cincinnati office. The investigation into Commentary came out of the Columbus office. Is there something going on inside the IRS offices in Ohio? Who will find out? If Richard Nixon were still president, the answer would be "the adversary press." Likewise if George W. Bush were. But most of the press turns out not to be very adversarial when a Democrat is in the White House. Hispanic Hype "Hispanic High School Graduates Pass Whites in Rate of College Enrollment," reads the headline of a press release from the Pew Hispanic Center. A smaller headline just above brings more good news: "High School Drop-Out Rate at Record Low." It turns out to be an excellent example of the misleading use of statistics. While the report contains plenty of actual good news about Hispanic educational attainment, Hispanics have not actually "passed" whites in any meaningful way. Here are the basic numbers from the press release: A record seven-in-ten (69%) Hispanic high school graduates in the class of 2012 enrolled in college that fall, two percentage points higher than the rate (67%) among their white counterparts, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This milestone is the result of a long-term increase in Hispanic college-going that accelerated with the onset of the recession in 2008 (Fry and Lopez, 2012). The rate among white high school graduates, by contrast, has declined slightly since 2008. The positive trends in Hispanic educational indicators also extend to high school. The most recent available data show that in 2011 only 14% of Hispanic 16- to 24-year-olds were high school dropouts, half the level in 2000 (28%). Starting from a much lower base, the high school dropout rate among whites also declined during that period (from 7% in 2000 to 5% in 2011), but did not fall by as much. If you do a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on the headline numbers and the dropout rates, you come up with the following figures: • Whites: 5% drop out, 31% finish high school but don't go to college, 64% go to college • Hispanics: 14% drop out, 27% finish high school but don't go to college, 59% go to college Hispanics have gained considerable ground relative to whites, closing the dropout gap from 21 percentage points to 9. But they have not surpassed whites either in high school graduation or college attendance--only in a statistic that combines both a measure of educational success (going to college) with one of failure (dropping out of high school, which reduces the denominator and thereby increases the overall number). His Wife Would Eat No Lean The Washington Post reports on a feminist kerfuffle from the University of Virginia, spurred by a panel discussion featuring "four legendary investors, All four were men, white and aging." We guess Benjamin Button was unavailable, but anyway: That prompted several audience members to submit questions wondering: Where are the women? Paul Tudor Jones II, a 1976 U-Va. graduate and billionaire Greenwich-based hedge fund manager, took a stab at answering. According to those who attended, Jones explained how traders must have extraordinary focus and commitment, working long hours and forgoing personal time. A lot of women opt out of such a high-intensity career, he said, especially once they have children. Carl P. Zeithaml, dean of the U-Va. McIntire School of Commerce, said that he immediately received complaints from alumni and faculty members who were concerned and, in some cases, appalled by the substance and framing of Jones's comments. It seemed to be the opposite of the message that Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is pushing as she visits college campuses and urges young women not to limit themselves. . . . On April 29, Zeithaml sent a lengthy e-mail to all students and staff to further explain Jones's comments and urge everyone, especially women and underrepresented minorities, to "enthusiastically and optimistically" pursue careers in which they have interest and aptitude. "In particular, I strongly encourage women who want to pursue a career in industries or professions that have not traditionally included women in large numbers to do so," Zeithaml wrote. "You should never be dissuaded by a few statistics from pursuing your passion." Whatever one may think of the merits of female careerism, how exactly is Jones's message "the opposite" of Sandberg's and Zeithaml's? He's saying that men tend to have more drive than women do. That women need to be encouraged to "lean in" reinforces his claim. Out on a Limb "Maybe Iran and North Korea will come to their senses and behave. Maybe Mr. Assad will finally fall. Maybe the Syrian insurgents will prove to be pro-American democrats after all. Maybe opportunistic senators and journalists will not play politics and one day abandon the very policies that they once urged their president to adopt. And then again, maybe not."--Victor Davis Hanson, Washington Times, May 10 We Blame George W. Bush "Who's to Blame for Vancouver Canucks' Disastrous Postseason?"--headline, BleacherReport.com, May 8 We're All Birthers Now "Unless you're a Native American, you came from someplace else."--tweet, @whitehouse, May 8 Violence Never Solved Anything "Michelle Obama Beats Hundreds of Women to Get Closest to Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor Prince Harry"--headline, BeforeItsNews.com, May 9 Leave Her Alone, You Creeps!

Check out this FoxNews.com report: Two San Jose State University professors took a picture as they held a match to a book that takes on the idea of global warming, and the photo landed on an official school website until some realized the idea of academics burning books is not exactly scholarly. The image depicted Alison Bridger, a professor and chairwoman of the university's department of meteorology and climate science, holding a lit match beneath "The Mad, Mad, Mad World of Climatism: Mankind and Climate Change Mania" as the 312-page paperback was held by assistant professor Craig Clements. "This week we received a deluge of free books from the Heartland Institute," the original caption read, according to an archived version of the webpage. ". . . Shown above, Drs. Bridger and Clements test the flammability of the book." SJSU's Department of Meteorology and Climate took the photo down from its website after a science blogger called attention to it. The department called it "an ill-conceived attempt at satire." No doubt that's an accurate description. They seem to have thought it was funny. But why? Aren't they aware that book-burning is associated with censorship and totalitarian regimes? The only way the joke makes sense is if the ones telling it are its butt. In a similar vein, here's the latest contribution from the New York Times's Charles Blow: Many on the political right simply can't get this diversity thing right--and I deeply doubt that they want to. Theirs is a bone-deep contempt for otherness, a congenital belief in the superiority-inferiority binary, a circle-the-wagons, zero-sum view of progress, prosperity and power. That's the difference between us and them: They hate everybody who isn't like them, whereas we don't hate anybody who's like us. Follow us on Twitter. Join Fans of Best of the Web Today on Facebook.

Four-dollar-a-gallon gasoline may be a cause for outrage. But it pales next to the righteous fury provoked by five-dollar-a-pint beer. Beer prices at bars and restaurants have risen over the past few months, as prices of hops and barley have skyrocketed and retail business has slowed alongside the economy. Some restaurants have replaced 16-ounce pint glasses with 14 ouncers -- a type of glassware one bartender called a "falsie." And customers are complaining that bartenders are increasingly putting less than 16 ounces of beer in a pint glass, filling up the extra space with foam. Two of the world's biggest glassware makers, Libbey and Cardinal International, say orders of smaller beer glasses have risen over the past year. Restaurateurs "want more of a perceived value," says Mike Schuster,
Libbey's marketing manager for glassware in the U.S. Glasses with a thicker bottom or a thicker shaft help create the perception. "You can increase the thickness of the bottom part but still retain the overall profile," he says. Dedicated beer drinkers are fighting back, with extra vigilance about exactly how much beer they get for their buck. They are protesting "cheater pints" and "profit pours" by outing alleged offenders on Web discussion boards and plugging bars that maintain 16-ounce pints, in hopes peer pressure will prevail. And they are spreading the word about how to spot the smaller glass (the bottom is thicker). Jason Alstrom, who founded the magazine BeerAdvocate last year, calls it the "Less for More" phenomenon. "It's happening everywhere," he says. He is urging readers and users of his Web site, www.beeradvocate.com, to "raise a fist and refuse to pay" when served a skimpy pint. PodcastReporter Nancy Keates discusses the shrinking pint phenomenon.
Evidence of short-pouring is hard to nail down, but there are signs the practice is common. Romano's Macaroni Grill, a national chain, uses the thick-bottomed 14 ouncers in at least some of its locations; a Romano's bartender in Portland, Ore., volunteered the nickname "falsies." (A corporate spokesman for Romano's declined to comment.) A bartender at a Florida location of the GameWorks chain said it serves beer in the thick-bottomed 14-ounce glasses, adding, "We are trained to say it's a pint." Pat Hart,
the GameWorks chain's vice president of operations, says the policy is to serve 16-ounce pints. At that location, Mr. Hart says, "they probably just ordered the wrong glasses." Jeff Alworth,
a Portland, Ore., beer blogger, university researcher and a founder of the Honest Pint Project, has been testing suspected short-pouring bars, in some cases measuring his beer-glass capacity by the men's room sink. His group collected more than 400 names in two weeks for an online petition urging state regulators to enforce a 16-ounce rule. And at one point, he was posting the names of bars that didn't measure up on his Web site. But in response to complaints, he now has taken to listing the names of establishments serving full pints in bigger glasses. "I'm not a firebrand," says Mr. Alworth. "I am devoted to Oregon beer, and it seemed like using glasses where you don't get a 16-ounce pour was not so cool." Some restaurants make no apology for reducing their beer-glass size. The Damon's Grill restaurant chain switched to 14 ouncers from 16-ounce glasses two years ago and didn't lower prices. "Someone who comes in and wants a beer doesn't want a huge glass," says Tanny Feerer,
vice president for purchasing at Damon's International. "Fourteen ounces is enough." Since then, the chain has held draft beer prices steady. The Hooters chain serves draft beer in 14-ounce glasses at franchised locations in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee, and 16-ounce glasses in other states. "We can get 20 more beers out of a keg that way," says Archie Gleason,
director of marketing for the franchisee, RMD Corp. Observant wine drinkers may also notice a change in glass size, says Lee Spielman,
a regional sales manager at Cardinal. After several years of pouring red wine into oversize "bowls," restaurants and bars now are starting to get complaints from customers about the size of the pour. Many places are switching to much smaller "universal" glasses, designed to hold either red or white wine, he says. The shape of the glass apparently can distort bar patrons' perception of how much beer they have been served. The British Medical Journal published a 2005 study by Brian Wansink, a Cornell University professor, and Koert van Ittersum, an assistant professor of marketing at Georgia Institute of Technology, concluding that restaurants and bars might increase profitability and reduce waste by switching to taller, narrower glasses and cups -- without sacrificing customer satisfaction. If people think they are getting more, they will be willing to pay more but won't necessarily drink more, the independent study concluded. Weather conditions and growing demand for small craft brews are causing a major shortage of hops and driving up prices. Paul Lin talks to Vermont brewers about what it means for the industry.
Mr. Alworth, the activist, demonstrated his methods on a recent Sunday afternoon at Henry's Tavern in Portland. He ordered a pint of a lighter-style lager -- which he chose because it doesn't foam a lot -- and poured it into a plastic measuring cup. He let it settle, then looked closely: The liquid reached a little above the 13-ounce mark. Next he measured the contents of a smaller glass of dark beer: It came out even less. With his Boston Red Sox cap pulled down low on his forehead, he tucked the empty light-beer glass under his corduroy jacket and went to the men's room, where he filled the glass to the brim with water -- 16 ounces, to be precise. The same procedure with the empty dark-beer glass revealed it held 14 ounces. Managers of several bars disputed Mr. Alworth's suggestion that they are skimping on their pint pours. Craig McKellar,
a manager at Henry's Tavern, says first of all, the bar uses only 16-ounce glasses, though from time to time a smaller glass could get mixed in, perhaps brought in from outside by a customer. "That would be very rare," he adds. He says he and other bartenders have a precise idea of how big the foam head on a beer should be. "The way brew masters want you to pour the beer is one-and-&frac12; inches of foam," Mr. McKellar says. "If you pour it without foam, beer connoisseurs would say it was flat." Maybe bars should use larger glasses, Mr. Alworth counters. That way, there would be room for the full pint plus a head of foam. After learning about his Honest Pint movement, Portland's Raccoon Lodge recently started serving pints in 20-ounce glasses, up from 16 ounces. The 16-ounce glasses held only about 14.5 ounces, says restaurant manager Lisa Crombie
; the 20-ounce glasses hold about 18 ounces. "We just thought it was fair," Ms. Crombie says. "People were paying for a pint, so they should get a pint." Beer activists are talking about developing stickers to adhere to the windows of bars and restaurants where pints live up to the name. Oregon legislator Brian Clem is taking up the issue for the state's 2009 budget, hoping to fund monitoring of beer portions by the state's agriculture department. In the U.K., the Imperial Pint (equivalent to 19.2 U.S. ounces) has been a government-regulated standard for several centuries. The standard requires use of official pint glasses -- with the word "Pint" and the European "CE" marking -- etched onto each glass. The glasses actually hold more than an Imperial Pint, so there's room for the foam. But the regulations haven't quieted debate. In England, a group called Campaign for Real Ale has been alleging for years that bars pinch pence by pouring short. In March, the British government energized the movement by slapping a new tax on alcohol. About 23,000 people have signed a petition in favor of government regulation of the size of the foam head on a pint of beer. Pubs that don't scrimp are undercut by pubs that do, says Nick Laver-Vincent,
who owns The Royal Oak in Big Bury, England, and who signed the petition. "It is cutthroat," he says. Beer drinkers feeling shortchanged can take immediate action: They can ask for a "top-off" after the foam on the profit pour settles. That's what George Collentine did when he was served a beer with almost two inches of foam at an Italian restaurant this month. "I just waited," says the 38-year-old chemical-company manager from Danbury, Conn. The bartender gave it to him. Write to Nancy Keates at nancy.keates@wsj.com
