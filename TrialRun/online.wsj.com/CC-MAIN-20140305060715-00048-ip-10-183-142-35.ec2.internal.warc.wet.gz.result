As New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie prepared for his Tuesday "state of the state" address, Democratic lawmakers announced the formation of two investigative committees that threaten to prolong the scandal over his aides' closings of bridge lanes last year, allegedly for political retribution. Meanwhile, a Monmouth University/Asbury Park Press poll showed the Republican governor's approval rating in New Jersey had dropped since the scandal escalated last week, but remained a robust 59%. Still, more than two-thirds...

Updated Nov. 11, 2010 10:53 a.m. ET
Several new programs that aim to help military family members and veterans start businesses were announced this week ahead of Thursday's observance of Veteran's Day. The Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University, along with sponsor Ernst & Young, is offering "boot camp" for entrepreneurs. The program—open to family members who are full-time caretakers of wounded veterans, as well as surviving spouses of those who lost their lives in combat—consists of a four-week online course, followed by a week of classes and a year of mentoring. Nelida Bagley, right, with her son, Army Staff Sergeant Jose Pequeno, who was severely injured while deployed to Iraq in 2006. Mr. Pequeno's sister, Elizabeth, is on left. Nelida Bagley of Tampa is among the participants in the program's inaugural class, which started last month. Her son, Army Staff Sergeant Jose Pequeno, was severely injured while deployed to Iraq in 2006 and can no longer walk or speak. Ms. Bagley has since quit her job as a supervisor for a manufacturing company to care for Mr. Pequeno full time, and is relying on her daughter for financial support. "As a parent, you're supposed to take care of your kids," says Ms. Bagley. "My daughter has been taking care of me for the past five years. So I need some type of income to allow me to take care of my family." Ms. Bagley is now hoping to launch a home-based business to help parents of disabled children get answers to questions about their health-care, financial and other options. In the boot camp, she's learning how to write a business plan and other start-up basics. "I was clueless how to do this," she says. "This program is a tremendous relief." Sergeant Pequeno had served as a gunner in Iraq.
Syracuse has been running another boot camp since 2007 that helps disabled veterans start businesses. It accepts 150 participants a year and the Small Business Administration, which guarantees loans for veterans, is a partner. Participants can also take classes on six other campuses: University of Connecticut, Texas A&M, University of California-Los Angeles and Florida State, Purdue and Louisiana State universities. This week, Syracuse and the SBA announced they're partnering on two more entrepreneur boot camps slated for 2011. These will include a program for helping National Guard members, Reservists and their families launch businesses and another for women veterans looking to do the same. Separately, franchise company Kitchen Tune-Up announced that it will begin donating the cost of up to 100 new units to honorably discharged veterans. Normally, buyers of the home-remodeling franchise would be charged a franchise fee, training and equipment expenses totaling $40,000. But founder David Haglund
says he's waiving that amount for veterans, so they will only be responsible for securing a vehicle, a business phone line, insurance and other basic operating expenses. Mr. Haglund, who started the 170-unit company 22 years ago, says his motivation to lend a hand to veterans comes from having family members who served in the military. He's also concerned about the nation's high unemployment rate and hopes that vets who open Kitchen Tune-Up locations will help create jobs. Kitchen Tune-Up first tested the initiative last spring by giving away five franchises to veterans like Frank Skubel,
who served in the Army Security Agency from 1967 to 1971. Mr. Skubel says that prior to becoming a franchisee, he'd gotten laid off from a regional vice-president position at a large telecommunications company. He wasn't ready to retire, and after failing to find a new job, he began looking into starting his own business. When he found out about Kitchen Tune-Up's veteran's program in July, taking up the opportunity was "an easy decision to make," he says. Mr. Skubel has since completed what he describes as a comprehensive two-week training program and is now setting up his franchise in his hometown of Tallahassee, Fla. Without the $40,000 discount the company gave him to get started, he says he would've needed to apply for a loan and isn't sure he would've had success given the poor economy. "I can only equate it to winning the lottery," he says. Write to Sarah E. Needleman at sarah.needleman@wsj.com Email

Backed by a ramp-up in TV ad purchases, Mitt Romney
will spend much of the final two weeks of the campaign presenting himself as a bipartisan bridge-builder, aides said, while President Barack Obama
tries to persuade voters that his Republican rival is painting a centrist veneer over conservative policy positions. With the last of their debates behind them, the candidates offered Tuesday a look at the closing arguments they plan to make in the home stretch and where they intend to work hardest to drive them home. Enlarge Image

Getty Images The battleground for the last weeks of the campaign may now be growing from nine to as many as a dozen states, as Republicans consider whether to try to capitalize on signs that the tightened race, shown to be deadlocked in many polls, is bringing the party new opportunities. A super PAC backing Mr. Romney said Tuesday that it would spend $300,000 in Maine, which assigns Electoral College votes by congressional district. The ad buy has the added benefit of reaching voters in New Hampshire, a long-standing battleground. Mr. Obama began highlighting his planned second-term agenda Tuesday by outlining proposals to boost manufacturing, slow the growth of college tuition and reduce the federal deficit. The effort—using direct mail, a glossy pamphlet and a new TV ad that will run in battleground states—is intended to appeal to undecided voters with an optimistic message and to quiet critics who have said Mr. Obama hasn't fully explained what he hopes to accomplish if re-elected. Enlarge Image
Gov. Romney campaigned in Henderson, Nev.
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images The super PAC backing Mr. Romney also is spending $1.6 million on his behalf in Michigan, a larger buy than in prior weeks in a state that has been considered a long shot for the GOP. The Romney campaign and its supporters said they were also looking at potential moves into Pennsylvania, but no evidence has yet emerged that they had bought advertising airtime there. Democrats say they remain skeptical of Mr. Romney's chances in Maine, Pennsylvania and in Michigan. Mr. Obama is making stops this week in Ohio, Virginia, Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Iowa. Mr. Romney was in two of those same states Tuesday, Nevada and Colorado. The two candidates are also running ads in those six states, plus Wisconsin, North Carolina and New Hampshire. Together, they make up the core battlegrounds for the remainder of the campaign. More Romney Draws Big Crowd in Colorado Bachmann Is Battling To Retain House Seat Global Reaction to Debate Mixed Later in the week, Mr. Obama moves on to Chicago to cast a ballot during early voting. That is a signal of how important it is to the Democratic cause to harvest as many votes as possible early, to minimize any chance that core voters won't show up on Election Day. Mr. Obama also will tape an interview with MTV that is set to air Friday—a sign of how crucial young voters are to his coalition. The president is scheduled to campaign in New Hampshire Saturday for the second time in as many weeks. He has spent little time in the state this fall, save a trip to the state after the Democratic National Convention in early September. The possible push by the Romney campaign into Pennsylvania comes as polls show him within striking distance of the lead. Because the state has restrictive absentee voting laws and no in-person early voting, more than 95% of the electorate is expected to vote on Election Day. Mr. Romney's image in Pennsylvania hasn't been colored by the Obama campaign's negative ads, making it more attractive as a potential target. Poll Tracker WSJ's guide to the latest political polls
Live: Election 2012 Stream Build Your Own: Electoral vote map Races and Candidates: By state, district Turning Points: Top Debate Moments State of the Race: Map of latest projections Moneyball: A portrait of money in politics Super PACs: How much are they spending? Issues: Romney vs. Obama on key topics Campaign Ads: Watch and rate Poll Tool: Compare Current, Past Candidates The Romney camp is considering whether to schedule what aides describe would be a major speech on the economy, an attempt to seal what they consider Mr. Romney's advantages on the issue that polls show is many voters' top concern. Mr. Romney and his allies also are outspending Democrats, though both sides continue to ratchet up their ad-buying for the final weeks, according to figures provided by several media buyers tracking the race. The GOP nominee and super PACs backing him will spend about $55 million this week, up from $40 million two weeks ago. Mr. Obama and Democrats will spend roughly $33 million, up from some $24.7 million two weeks ago. Mr. Obama's advertising gap is likely narrower than spending levels suggest, however. Most of the pro-Romney spending comes from outside groups, which don't get the lower, favorable rates for airtime that stations, by law, must offer to candidates. In airtime purchases by the campaigns alone, the president is outspending his GOP rival, more than $25 million to about $16 million this week, ad buyers said. Republicans are still making a full-court press for Ohio, where polls suggest Mr. Obama maintains a narrow edge. Mr. Romney and his allies will combine for more than $12 million in ad spending in Ohio this week, more than any other state, compared to $7.9 million for Democrats, most of which comes from the Obama campaign. GOP forces are also outspending Democrats by more than two-to-one in Wisconsin and Iowa. Mr. Obama enters the last stretch of the campaign with the more complicated messaging challenge than Mr. Romney, who is portraying himself as someone who can bring the parties together. In contrast, Mr. Obama is trying to strike a positive tone while also arguing that his opponent is masking his conservative policy positions. The Obama campaign had envisioned projecting a more optimistic tone in the fall, after a summer of trading deeply negative barbs. But the president's team has been caught off guard by Mr. Romney's early October pivot to a more moderate tone, and in some cases more centrist positions on key issues. Now, the president's main emphasis before Election Day will be on stressing the differences between himself and Mr. Romney on nearly every policy issue, aides said, and to argue that his opponent is more conservative than he now appears. "We're accustomed to seeing politicians change their positions from four years ago. We are not accustomed to seeing politicians change their position from four days ago,'' Mr. Obama said Tuesday at a campaign rally in Delray Beach, Fla., where he accused Mr. Romney of shifting his stances on the auto industry rescue, Medicare and on removing U.S. troops from Iraq. The Romney campaign said it would continue casting the GOP nominee as a pragmatic problem-solver. Advisers said that in focus groups, voters have said they are frustrated that Mr. Obama hasn't been able to overcome partisan divisions, a goal in his 2004 Senate campaign and his 2008 White House bid. Tuesday night in Colorado, Mr. Romney drew a crowd his campaign numbered at 12,000 to the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. There, he told supporters that the president is out of ideas and out of excuses. In Monday night's debate, Mr. Romney softened earlier attacks on China and the president's handling of uprisings in the Arab world, blurred differences on Afghanistan and highlighted their mutual support of continued drone strikes on suspected terrorists. The foreign policy-themed debate drew 59.2 million viewers, Nielsen said Tuesday, compared with 56.5 million for the third presidential debate in 2008. This season's first debate, earlier this month, had drawn 67.2 million viewers. But Monday's debate was up against both "Monday Night Football" and Game 7 of baseball's National League championship series. —Laura Meckler, Colleen McCain Nelson, Sara Murray and Keach Hagey contributed to this article.

WASHINGTON—A federal watchdog is faulting U.S. bank regulators for a flawed review of foreclosure documents, saying the agencies didn't establish consistent procedures or adequately monitor the consulting firms performing the work. The Government Accountability Office, in a draft of a report viewed by The Wall Street Journal, criticized the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Reserve for not ensuring banks were...

December 10, 2012
Business & Finance *** Chinese-owned auto-parts company Wanxiang America won the bidding for A123 Systems,
a U.S. government-backed battery maker that has yet to turn a profit, at a bankruptcy auction. China's industrial output increased 10.1% in November from a year earlier, the strongest since March, as the nation boosts its spending on infrastructure. U.S. stock exchanges competed to win Chinese IPOs last decade. Now, some firms that listed in the U.S. have run into trouble. A planned overhaul of listing rules for Hong Kong will require banks to do more to vouch for the integrity of IPO candidates. An EU analysis found Huawei and ZTE are dumping products onto the European market at low prices. Officials are debating whether to investigate and risk igniting a trade war with China. AIG is close to an agreement to sell its plane-leasing business to a group of Chinese financial firms for roughly $5 billion. Goldman will pay $1.5 million to settle civil charges that if failed to supervise a former trader. Greece appeared close to achieving its target in a debt-buyback plan demanded by the country's official creditors. U.S. real-estate investment trusts had another good year, but some fund managers say REITs are becoming less appealing even as they grow more popular. Hiring increased at a slow but steady pace at U.S. businesses last month, despite a massive storm and growing fears of a brewing fiscal crisis in Washington. Steelmakers have demanded increases of up to 15% in the U.S. and are getting an average rise of around 10%, marking a modest recovery as they try to reverse a prolonged decline in prices. World-Wide *** U.S. forces raided a Taliban hideout and rescued an American citizen who had been kidnapped days earlier outside Kabul, leaving seven Taliban captors dead. Italian Prime Minister Monti said he plans to resign after pushing the budget through Parliament, a move aimed at staying above the political fray as Italy enters a tense campaign season. Russian and U.S. diplomats held talks on Syria with the U.N. peace envoy, while Lebanese media said four people were killed in Syria-linked fighting in Tripoli. The death toll from Typhoon Bopha rose to 540, with 827 people still missing, Philippine officials said. The damage to agriculture was estimated at $208 million but was expected to rise. Email

By
Julian E. Barnes And Adam Entous Jan. 10, 2013 7:25 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—Afghan President Hamid Karzai met with U.S. officials Thursday in talks over a long-term U.S. troop presence in his country, part of what Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said was "the last chapter" of the American effort to establish a self-sustaining Afghanistan. On Friday, Mr. Karzai is set to meet with President Barack Obama, and the White House will announce military aid it plans to give the Afghan military,...

Have scientists finally created a bionic eye? The quest to develop a device that will give some blind people vision again, a retinal prosthesis, has been challenging. Shirley Wang joins Lunch Break with the latest on the research. Photo: Second Sight.
Regulators have approved a bionic eye for the first time in the U.S., saying Second Sight Medical Products Inc.'s retinal prosthesis can be used to treat a certain kind of blindness. The Food and Drug Administration approved the Argus II, which sends electrical stimulation to the retina to induce vision in individuals afflicted with retinitis pigmentosa. This disorder, which can run in families, damages and kills the cells in the retina—a tissue layer at the back of the eye—that process light. The disease causes vision to become increasingly blurry until they can't see at all. Around 100,000 patients in the U.S. have the condition. The Argus II, which is already available in Europe, can't restore sight completely, but it can improve vision in individuals who can see almost nothing. Enlarge Image
The Argus II, which is already available in Europe, can't restore sight completely, but it can improve vision.
Associated Press Earlier The Quest to Create a Bionic Eye Gets Clearer 1/28/13 "This is a game changer in sight-affecting diseases, that represents a huge step forward for the field and for these patients who were without any available treatment options until now," said Second Sight Chief Executive Robert Greenberg.
The device works by bypassing the damaged cells that process light. Video cameras mounted on glasses capture the visual information in the form of light; the data are then transmitted wirelessly to the implant to trigger electrodes in the chip to stimulate pixels of light on the retina. This information is then sent to the brain and processed normally as an image. Enlarge Image

Second Sight Medical Products/Reuters Argus II is set to become available later this year in U.S. clinical centers, and Second Sight said it would be adding sites to make the therapy more readily available. To date, the technology allows the wearer to see in black and white, and is most useful for seeing sharp contrasts. But scientists hope that it will eventually enable color vision. "The fact that many patients can use the Argus implant in their activities of daily living such as recognizing large letters, locating the position of objects, and more, has been beyond our wildest dreams, yet the promise to the patients is real and we expect it only to improve over time," said Mark Humayun,
a doctor and medical professor at the University of Southern California who was involved with developing the device. Scientists have said that designing a bionic eye has been much more difficult than developing aids like cochlear implants for hearing, in part because visual information is two-dimensional, and because of the anatomy of the eye. There are also many technical challenges, such as how to add more electrodes into the tiny chip that sits on the retina—about 5 millimeters by 7 millimeters in the case of Argus II—to stimulate enough cells in the retina to produce a good quality image. Normal vision is based on more than one hundred million receptors in each eye that process light, say experts. Many other academic centers and companies are working on competing technology they say is more advanced than Second Sight's. In 1991, when Second Sight's Dr. Greenberg was still in medical training at Johns Hopkins University, he watched a retinal surgeon perform a procedure where he placed a wire in a patient's eye and ran a bit of electrical current through it, and the patient saw a spot of light. The surgeon placed a second wire and the patient reported seeing two spots of light. Dr. Greenberg could see the potential for creating a bionic eye if engineering issues could be worked out. "At that point, I thought it was an engineering project," he said in an interview earlier this year. "Little did I realize it would take 20 years before we would commercialize it." The Sylmar, Calif.-based company was formed in 1998 by several co-founders, including entrepreneur Alfred Mann.
With a number of academic collaborators, they fashioned an early retinal implant from a cochlear implant for the ear with 16 electrodes, each of which stimulated a small area of the retina. Even with such a small number of electrodes that allowed for a small patch of vision, patients unexpectedly said they found the device useful by moving their heads back and forth and scanning the environment, said Dr. Greenberg. The company chose not to commercialize the initial device because the surgery was complicated, taking four surgeons eight hours to complete it, said Dr. Greenberg. In the Argus II, the newer generation device, the surgery takes two hours and involves 60 electrodes. Write to Shirley S. Wang at shirley.wang@wsj.com Email

Voters Shy Away on Spain Split
In Election, Support Wanes for Catalan Leader Urging a Referendum on Wealthy Region's Independence By
Jonathan House and Matt Moffett Updated Nov. 26, 2012 10:55 a.m. ET
BARCELONA, Spain—Voters in parliamentary elections in Spain's wealthy Catalonia region issued a rebuke to the leader who had sought to become the standard-bearer for forces seeking to secede from Spain, even as the ballot gave broad backing to pro-independence parties. Analysts said the disappointing showing by the party headed by Catalonia's current leader, Artur Mas, could take some of the steam out of the independence movement in...
