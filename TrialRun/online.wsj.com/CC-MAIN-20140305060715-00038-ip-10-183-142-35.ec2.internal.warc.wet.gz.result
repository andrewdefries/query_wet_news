Biography
Updated May 6, 2013 2:06 p.m. ET
An investment of A$5 million can yield Australian residency under a recently launched visa program. Alan Lee of Moisson Group tells the WSJ's Deborah Kan why his Chinese clients are attracted to Australia.
Australia said that so far it has attracted 170 applicants to a new program to develop foreign investment by offering overseas millionaires the right of residency in return for a portion of their wealth, in a bid to help the country compete better against other nations for money and expertise from abroad. The so-called significant investor visa was launched in November. If all those made so far are accepted, the applications, believed to be mostly from China, would translate into inbound investment of at least 850 million Australian dollars (US$877 million). Enlarge Image

AFP/Getty Images The program lets foreigners settle in Australia for up to four years, then seek permanent residency, in exchange for a minimum A$5 million investment during their stay. The money can be placed in federal or state bonds, managed funds, Australian companies, or in a combination of those assets. The push by Australia to start attracting foreign investors by offering them residency comes as the country faces what Finance Minister Penny Wong terms a new reality, as a decadelong mining boom evaporates amid a slowing global economy. The country is also playing catch-up with others offering visas to the wealthy investors. Its neighbor New Zealand, offers visas to those willing to invest as little as 1.5 million New Zealand dollars (US$1.3 million). And the U.S., a magnet for Chinese investors, grants green cards to qualifying foreign nationals for investing as little as $500,000 in a qualified U.S. business that creates a minimum number of jobs. In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, more than $1.8 billion was raised by the U.S. this way and 7,641 foreign nationals were issued visas, 80% of them Chinese. In Australia, successful applicants are allowed later to apply for permanent visas. There is no upper limit on the number of special visas the government can grant. Consultants at Deloitte expect the total to climb to around 700 a year, potentially at least A$3.5 billion in fresh foreign investment. Related Video

But not all applications are guaranteed to succeed. The department of immigration said it had granted the first significant-investor visa to a Chinese toy manufacturer and his family. A spokesman for the department said that following a four-month assessment of the his application, the candidate made a A$5 million investment in Victoria state bonds. The government declined to identify the successful applicant. "Australia is in active competition with other countries across our region for successful, high-wealth individuals and the capital and business acumen that comes with them," Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor
said last week. While the program is open to all, Chinese nationals are likely to be among the biggest takers, according to people involved with the program. Indeed, the ranks of China's wealthy have risen. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates China has more than a million millionaires and about 60,000 "super rich," or people with more than A$15 million to their name. The special Australian visa has a unique identifier number "188," making it distinct from the traditional "457" visa given to most temporary foreign workers. Adding to the allure of the investor visa, the government has created a new subclass of permanent visa to go along with the program, "888," a number many Chinese associate with wealth. "Clearly, the whole thing has been targeted at China so far," said Bill Fuggle, Sydney-based head of financial services Baker & McKenzie, which advises clients, including many Chinese, on significant-investor visas. The government's openness to wealthy foreigners contrasts with its approach more generally to immigration, a polarizing topic in Australia, particularly ahead of an election only four months away. Prime Minister Julia Gillard
has pledged to clamp down on the "457" temporary work visas. The Labor government, which opinion polls suggest will lose the Sept. 14 election to the center-right Liberal Nationals, has proposed changes to the 457 temporary work visa system and has said it would "put Aussie workers first" as the nation's economy has slowed, led by a cooling in the mining sector. Foreign investment, particularly from China, is a hot-button topic in Australia. Last year, conservative lawmakers, particularly from rural areas, attacked the government for allowing the takeover of a large cotton farm, Cubbie Station, by a Chinese-led consortium. Treasurer Wayne Swan
labeled their views as "xenophobic claptrap" at the time. In 2011, the government rejected a takeover of Australia's main bourse operator, ASX Ltd.

Inside Obama's Syria Debate
By
Adam Entous
March 29, 2013 11:00 p.m. ET
With the death toll mounting in the Syrian rebellion, the Obama administration has stepped up calls for strongman Bashar al-Assad to give up power. But two years into the bloodiest chapter of the Arab Spring, the administration, under pressure from lawmakers and allies, has only taken halting steps to help provide training, equipment and intelligence to moderate rebel fighters. That incremental shift is the product of a...

Regulators Cut J.P. Morgan Community-Lending Grade
By
Dan Fitzpatrick
Jan. 2, 2013 7:58 p.m. ET
Regulators twice in the past six months disclosed downgrades of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s community-lending practices, a rare occurrence for any large U.S. bank. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency lowered J.P. Morgan Chase's primary deposit-taking bank and credit-card-lending unit to "satisfactory" from "outstanding" after examining their performance under a law designed to encourage banks to lend...

& Co. For 2012, net income was $7.54 billion at Citigroup and $21.3 billion at J.P. Morgan. Citigroup also outlined a new pay plan that ties compensation to stock performance and return on assets, a measure of the New York company's profitability relative to its size. Enlarge Image
Michael Corbat, CEO of Citigroup Bloomberg News The new plan was announced after The Wall Street Journal reported that Citigroup is shelving an unusual executive profit-sharing arrangement that raised hackles with investors following its adoption in 2011. Citigroup's moves come as Chairman Michael E. O'Neill
seeks to avoid repeating last spring's defeat in a shareholder-advisory vote on compensation known as "say on pay." Citigroup was alone among major lenders in having its plan rejected by investors. "Citigroup lost their say-on-pay vote because there was too much discretion in the way compensation was awarded," said Robin Ferracone,
founder and chief executive of Farient Advisors, an executive-compensation consulting firm based in Los Angeles. "Citigroup has addressed that issue head-on by putting objective measures and goals in the plan." Large financial firms are under scrutiny for their pay practices following their rescue by taxpayers during the financial crisis and a long period of poor stock performance. J.P. Morgan's Mr. Dimon had his pay cut in half for 2012 to $11.5 million, after the nation's largest bank by assets suffered a $6 billion trading loss. Morgan Stanley

cut the pay of Chairman and Chief Executive James Gorman
after revenue at the New York securities firm tumbled 19% from a year earlier to $26.11 billion. Soon after taking over as chairman in April, Mr. O'Neill put himself in charge of the five-person board group that sets executive pay. He spent much of the summer and fall meeting with corporate-governance experts at proxy-advisory firms as well as 20 Citigroup investors representing more than 30% of the company's shares outstanding. The new compensation plan dictates that 30% of pay for top executives, including Mr. Corbat, come in so-called performance share units that are delivered after three years, depending on the company's performance over that span. Other executives eligible for the performance-share units include John Gerspach,
the chief financial officer, and Manuel Medina-Mora,
a co-president with oversight of global consumer banking. Related Video

& Co.—executives will receive no units. Similarly, if Citigroup's return on assets—annual net income divided by total assets—falls below 0.6%, executives won't get any units. Citigroup's return on assets in 2012 was 0.4%, compared with 0.59% in 2011. But if the company's shares perform in line with rivals and the return on assets hits 0.85%, executives can receive 100% of their target performance-unit allocation. If returns rise further, executives can collect 150% of that allocation. The profit-sharing plan being scrapped emerged as a sticking point in Mr. O'Neill's conversations with shareholders and corporate-governance experts, said people with knowledge of the talks, amid broader concerns about how the company pays top executives and how it discloses those practices to shareholders. Citigroup's say-on-pay defeat helped paved the way for last October's departure of Chief Executive Vikram Pandit.
In 2011, his compensation rose to $14.9 million from the $1 he received annually while the company repaid $45 billion of federal bailout funds. Enlarge Image
Vikram Pandit's retention package included a profit-sharing plan.
Reuters Some shareholders contended the profit-sharing plan made it too easy for executives to collect large sums without ensuring outstanding company and stock performance. "When there are this many issues, the board needs to start from scratch," said Aeisha Mastagni,
investment officer of the California State Teachers Retirement System, which owns nine million Citigroup shares. The decision to allow the expiration of the incentive plan wasn't driven by the say-on-pay defeat, said people familiar with the company. Ms. Mastagni was one of a handful of pension- and mutual- fund managers who voiced their concerns on an Aug. 15 conference call with Mr. O'Neill. Mr. Pandit's retention package included a profit-sharing plan that would have paid him in excess of $6 million if cumulative pretax profit for ongoing operations in 2011 and 2012 totaled $12 billion, providing he had remained with the company. That is less than what Citigroup earned before taxes in 2010. "When the threshold is set so low, that is not good corporate governance," said Ms. Ferracone of Farient Advisors. Mr. Pandit and his deputy, John Havens,
who served as Citigroup's president and chief operating officer, were forced out before the first leg of the award was payable and will collect nothing. "When our shareholders spoke last year about Citi's compensation structure, we listened," Mr. O'Neill said in a regulatory filing Wednesday. Corrections & Amplifications An earlier version of this article described Aeisha Mastagni as chief investment officer of the California State Teachers Retirement System. She is an investment officer there. Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com Email

Sprint Nextel Corp. raised its offer to acquire Clearwire Corp. to $5 a share, topping a rival bid from Dish Network Corp. with a price that could end the battle for the mobile-broadband provider. The higher bid won the backing of Clearwire's board and a group of investors including some hedge funds that had complained vocally that an earlier Sprint bid was too low. Sprint already owns about half of Clearwire, and the support of the...

Images from ads aiming to sway 'fiscal cliff' talks include one backed by unions, above, calling for job creation and not job cuts. VAJobsNotCuts.com The election ad wars are over. The "fiscal cliff" ad wars are just beginning. Interest groups of all types are launching campaigns to stir up Americans about the fiscal cliff, the $500 billion combination of tax increases and spending cuts set to start in January. Their target: members of Congress under pressure to make a deal with the White House in coming weeks to solve the problem. In one ad from a campaign that calls itself Defend My Dividend, somber music plays while a couple at a kitchen table frets about the effect of higher dividend taxes on their retirement. The 15% top tax rate on shareholder dividends is set to rise in January to 43.4%—the top marginal income-tax rate plus a surcharge that helps pay for President Barack Obama's
health-care law. Some of the nation's largest unions are launching campaigns to stir up Americans about the fiscal cliff. This ad urges voters to call on Democratic senators to prevent deep spending cuts and extend tax cuts for middle-class families. The ads are sponsored by the NEA, SEIU and AFSCME.
"The president and Congress have got to work together to stop this dividend tax hike," the man tells his wife. She adds, "Before it's too late." The advertisement, which is running on national cable TV and local stations in Washington, D.C., is the work of the Alliance for Savings and Investment, an organization that includes trade groups representing dividend-paying companies. The TV spot is set to run along with print and online advertising throughout policy makers' negotiations over the fiscal cliff. On the other side of the argument, some of the nation's largest unions, including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, are focusing on specific lawmakers in television, radio and online ads that started Thursday to coincide with Thanksgiving weekend. Enlarge Image
Ad from seniors lobby AARP push preserving Medicare and Social Security.
AARP More Policy Ads From 'Harry and Louise' to Newt and Nancy The spots, which the unions called an "opening salvo" in their ad campaign, urge voters to call Democratic senators in three states—Colorado, Missouri and Virginia—whose support the left will need to secure tax increases on upper-income earners. Radio ads in congressional districts in Alaska, Missouri and Pennsylvania focus on centrist House Republicans who previously have supported a combination of spending cuts and new tax revenue to reduce the federal budget deficit. The range of messages underscores the challenge that policy makers face. Some groups are pushing to overhaul entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Others are trying to prevent just that. Some want budget talks to include corporate-tax changes; others want to ensure protection for sector-specific tax incentives. A new TV ad shows a couple fretting about the effect of higher dividend taxes on their retirement. The ad, running on cable and local TV stations in D.C., was organized by the Alliance for Savings and Investment. (Photo & Video: DefendMyDividend.org)
Too Small To Fail, an effort to raise awareness about troubles facing American children, coined a simple message: "Don't push our kids over the fiscal cliff." The group wants to prevent cuts to education and children's health programs, among others. AARP, the seniors lobbying group, also is invoking future generations as it assails some proposals to alter Medicare and Social Security. "Raiding Medicare and Social Security to pay for other government programs is shortsighted and harmful to seniors and their kids and grandkids," said AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond. AARP is running a national ad campaign that says Washington shouldn't "cram decisions about the future of these programs into a last-minute budget deal." Enlarge Image
Ad from AARP.
AARP Taking a different position is a group of more than 200 business organizations, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They have urged lawmakers to "immediately begin a process to fundamentally restructure our nation's entitlement programs—Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security—and to put these valued and important programs on a sustainable financial path." The Business Roundtable, a group of big-company chief executives, is running ads featuring CEOs discussing risks posed by the fiscal cliff. AARP is running a national ad campaign that says Washington shouldn't "cram decisions about the future of Medicare and Social Security programs into a last-minute budget deal."
Fix the Debt campaign, an effort inspired by leaders of the 2010 Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction panel, includes more than 100 CEOs as participants. The campaign, which has launched a nationwide ad blitz, backs a mix of tax-revenue increases and spending cuts to shrink the deficit. Even political organizations that might have quieted down after the election are staying active in the fiscal-cliff debate. Obama for America, the president's campaign arm, called on supporters this week to "spread the word" about his plan to replace the fiscal cliff measures with a combination of tax increases on the wealthy and spending cuts. It released a graphical explanation of the White House's approach, to be shared across social media. Write to Sudeep Reddy at sudeep.reddy@wsj.com Email

Two former traders at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. accused of overstating the value of their group's positions aren't pointing their fingers at senior executives at the bank in their defense. Instead, their strategy will be to shift blame to Bruno Iksil, the so-called London whale, by claiming that Mr. Iksil was the one responsible for valuing the group's positions, not the two men, according to people close to the matter.

Sam Walker Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
Updated July 8, 2005 12:01 a.m. ET
When the Boston Red Sox won the World Series in October, they closed the book on one of America's most durable folk legends, the "Curse of the Bambino." Most people assumed that its perpetrator, Babe Ruth, had finally forgiven the franchise for selling him to the New York Yankees in 1919 and moved on to some less malevolent hobby, like badminton. But as Tuesday's All-Star Game approaches, there's a strong case to be made that George Herman Ruth never really did get out of the cursing business. He just switched his focus from the Red Sox to somebody who really made his hair stand on end. Barry Bonds. On July 14, 2003, almost exactly two years ago, Mr. Bonds spoke to reporters in Chicago before the All-Star Game. The following day, this remark about the Babe appeared in newspapers around the country: "...as a left-handed hitter, I wiped him out. That's it. And in the baseball world, Babe Ruth's everything, right? I got his slugging percentage, and I'll take his home runs, and that's it. Don't talk about him no more." Getting No Respect While the quote generated a few harrumphs on the sports pages and drew a stern rebuttal from the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum in Baltimore, most people shrugged. You could take issue with the man's lack of respect for history, but there was no sense in arguing the substance of his point. Two years earlier, Mr. Bonds had claimed the single-season home-run record with 73, and at that particular point in the 2003 season, had already clouted 30. Just before arriving in Chicago, he'd homered in five consecutive games -- a feat only three other major-league ballplayers had ever accomplished (none of whom was named Ruth). In total, Mr. Bonds had 643 home runs and it seemed likely that he would topple the Babe's career mark of 714 the following summer. Moreover, Mr. Bonds had overcome his historical struggles in the postseason to lead the San Francisco Giants to the 2002 World Series, which they had come within six outs of winning. And after years of being shunned by Madison Avenue, he'd mended his prickly image to the point where Charles Schwab and KFC had put him in commercials. But almost immediately after making his crack about Ruth, bad things started happening to Barry Bonds. One month later, in August, his father, Bobby, lost a battle with cancer. In September, as part of a steroids probe, federal agents raided the home of his personal trainer, and the offices of Balco, a nutritional supplement lab he'd endorsed. By October, Mr. Bonds had hit only 15 more home runs, and when the Florida Marlins eliminated the Giants from the postseason in four games, he only managed to contribute two hits. Two weeks later, Mr. Bonds was subpoenaed by a federal grand jury. Throughout the 2004 season, Mr. Bonds was pounded with questions about steroids, and while he continued to mash the baseball, he saw a lot fewer opportunities to do so: Opposing teams walked him with such frequency that he set a major league record with 232 free passes. In a crucial late September game, the Los Angeles Dodgers bounced Mr. Bonds and the Giants from the playoffs with a walkoff grand slam in the bottom of the ninth. The Ruthkiller had finished the game with three walks. And those were happier days. In the space of seven months, his sworn testimony to the grand jury was leaked to the press (he said he used steroids, but unknowingly), a woman claiming to be his longtime girlfriend appeared on "At Large with Geraldo Rivera" and Mr. Bonds made a spectacle of himself in a rambling, strident press conference. A new book by former slugger Ron Kittle accuses him of making a racist comment. On the Couch Today, two years after the rant against Ruth, the Giants are having their worst season in nine years while Mr. Bonds, recovering from three separate knee operations, has yet to play a game. He'll have to watch this year's All-Star Game from a couch. Naturally, there are some explanations for this run of tough luck that don't involve disembodied spirits. Mr. Bonds is nearly 41 years old, so it's hardly surprising that his knee needs work. He'd probably have blown past Ruth already if opposing managers didn't walk him so much. And in the end, the "Curse of the Press Conference" may be short-lived. If Mr. Bonds makes it back this season, he'll need only 12 home runs to pass Ruth on the all-time list and make his Chicago prophesy come true. In the meantime, Mr. Bonds seems to have entered his very own Cone of Silence. Most of his public remarks come in the form of occasional blog entries on his fan site, barrybonds.com. Last week, nearly two years after dissing the Babe, he wrote: "It's been a couple weeks since my last update, but there really hasn't been much to report. My rehab has been the same. Last week my knee slightly swelled, so I'll be taking it easy, sticking with range of motion and strengthening exercises." Mr. Bonds, showing no sign of the bravado that overcame him two years ago, summed up his circumstances thusly: "At this point in the season my outlook is still positive." Badminton, anyone?

Bret Swanson and George Gilder Updated Feb. 22, 2008 12:01 a.m. ET
Two decades ago, Sun Microsystems prophesied: "The network is the computer." Today, BitTorrent video and 3D graphics flood the Internet, Apple iPhones tap the Net's computing power, and PC-king Microsoft pursues Net-centric Yahoo. Sun's mantra has become reality. But as the Internet booms and moves to the center of the global economic sphere, it draws proportional attention from politicians and regulators. In Congress and at the FCC, legislators and lawyers think they can manage overflowing Net traffic and commerce better than the network companies themselves. Next week, the FCC is meeting en banc at Harvard Law School to consider two petitions that seek to ban network "traffic management." The meeting's host, Rep. Ed Markey, has renewed his pursuit of a far-reaching Internet regulatory regime known as "net neutrality." These regulatory efforts overlook a fundamental shift: An upsurge of technological change and a rising tide of new forms of data are deeply transforming the Internet's capabilities and uses. The first phase of the Net was the original Arpanet research project that connected a few, and then a few thousand, scientists. The second phase brought the Internet to the masses, with the advent of the World Wide Web, the graphical browser and email in the mid-1990s. Internet traffic boomed 100-fold between 1994 and 1996. In the third phase of Net evolution, network architecture and commercial business plans reflect the dominance of rich video and interactive media traffic. The third wave is now swelling into an exaflood, or torrent, of Internet and Internet Protocol (IP) traffic. There's YouTube, IPTV, high-definition images and "cloud computing" -- in which individuals and businesses use the centralized computing resources of Google and IBM data centers, instead of the local computing resources of their own PCs or office systems. Not to mention the ubiquitous mobile camera. To give you an idea of the scope, an exabyte (a one-quintillion byte unit of information or computer storage) is 50,000 times larger than a digitized Library of Congress. By the end of 2006, annual U.S. Internet traffic was around 10 exabytes. As new fiber-optic wireline and 3G wireless networks from AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Cox and Cogent bring us real broadband for the first time, the nature and volume of Net traffic is changing dramatically. By mid-2007, Microsoft Video Calling was generating as many bytes as the entire Internet in 1997. Cisco's newest video-conferencing system requires 15 megabits per second in each direction. A one-hour conference call could thus produce 13.5 gigabytes, which is more than a high-definition movie. Just 75 of these Cisco conference calls would equal the entire Internet traffic of the year 1990. Netflix, which is gradually moving from the post office to the Net, last year shipped 1.8 million DVDs every day. If converted to high definition, Netflix would have mailed 5.8 exabytes of motion pictures, or almost half the size of the entire U.S. Internet of 2007. Building on rapid advances in Nvidia and ATI graphics processors, one 3D multiplayer game (such as Second Life or World of Warcraft) with one million users could generate more than an exabyte per year of network traffic, or almost a tenth of last year's U.S. Internet volume. In a new Discovery Institute report, we estimate that, by 2015, U.S. IP traffic will reach an annual total of 1,000 exabytes, or one million million billion bytes. The U.S. Internet will thus be 50 times larger by 2015, equal to 50 million Libraries of Congress. This will require some $100 billion in new Internet infrastructure in the U.S. over the next five years. We need a dramatic expansion in raw capacity, or bandwidth, and also fine-grained traffic management capabilities to ensure robust service for increasingly demanding consumers. But none of this can happen if we regulate complex network traffic engineering and experimental business plans. All networks use some form of traffic management, whether crude or complex. As our colleague Ken Ferree notes, every industry, from grocery store "express lines" to "singles" ski-lift lines, attempts to shape and manage demand. Today's communications networks buffer, label, parse, schedule, prioritize, route, switch, modify, replicate, police and meter the bits flowing through their links and nodes. New pricing schemes that charge per byte consumed might also help to manage supply and demand on the Internet. The petitions under consideration at the FCC and in the Markey net neutrality bill would set an entirely new course for U.S. broadband policy, marking every network bit and byte for inspection, regulation and possible litigation. Every price, partnership, advertisement and experimental business plan on the Net would have to look to Washington for permission. Many would be banned. Wall Street will not deploy the needed $100 billion in risk capital if Mr. Markey, digital traffic cop, insists on policing every intersection of the Internet. Capacious, big-bandwidth networks will transcend many of today's specific complaints. As raw capacity expands, more and more applications and users can peacefully coexist. But inevitably, sophisticated network users with innovative applications will find creative ways to push the boundaries of capacity on certain network links, and some bits will be shuffled and queued. The network is now a global computer made up of hardware, software and human minds. But this new, fast-changing and highly organic computer is no more easily regulated than were the circuits, storage, memory and protocols of a mainframe or PC. Leaving it to Washington agencies and committees to engineer the exaflood would be an act of unimaginable folly. Mr. Swanson is a senior fellow and director of the Center for Global Innovation at The Progress & Freedom Foundation. Mr. Gilder is a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute.
