Tax Break Nears End For Online Shoppers
Republican Governors, in Need of Revenue, Drop Opposition
By
Monica Langley
Updated July 16, 2012 2:25 p.m. ET
Republican governors, eager for new revenue to ease budget strains, are dropping their longtime opposition to imposing sales taxes on online purchases, a significant political shift that could soon bring an end to tax-free sales on the Internet. Conservative governors, joining their Democratic counterparts, have been making deals with online retail giant Amazon.com to collect state sales taxes. The movement picked up an important ally when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie—widely mentioned as a potential vice-presidential...

WASHINGTON—Massachusetts Democrats on Tuesday chose Rep. Edward Markey, a long-serving House member and a liberal on environmental and social issues, as their nominee for the Senate seat vacated by John Kerry. Businessman Gabriel Gomez won the Republican nomination. Messrs. Markey and Gomez will now face each other in a June 25 general election. Mr. Kerry resigned from the Senate in January to become secretary of state. With 98% of precincts reporting, Mr. Markey led his Democratic rival, Rep. Stephen Lynch, 58% to 42%, according to the Associated Press tally. In the Republican primary, Mr. Gomez topped two rivals. With 98% of precincts reporting, Mr. Gomez, a private-equity executive and former Navy SEAL, had 51% of the vote, while Michael Sullivan, a former U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, had 36% and state Rep. Dan Winslow had 13%. While Massachusetts has elected a string of GOP governors and one Republican senator in recent years, Mr. Markey enters the two-month general-election campaign as the favorite. Democrats hold a 3-to-1 advantage over Republicans in registered voters, though independent voters outnumber those in both parties, accounting for nearly 53% of the electorate. Mr. Markey, 66 years old, outraised all candidates in both parties in the primary election. Mr. Gomez's victory gives Republicans a Hispanic candidate at a time when the party is trying to broaden its appeal among minorities. Mr. Gomez, 47, is a first-generation American; his parents emigrated from Colombia. He also has deep pockets: He lent his campaign $600,000 earlier this year, according to records submitted to federal election officials. Mr. Gomez came to Massachusetts to earn an M.B.A. at Harvard University. He has a personal connection to an event that absorbs voter attention these days: He ran this year's Boston Marathon and was near the explosions that occurred toward the end of the race. The two Democratic House members brought very different political profiles to the primary race. While Mr. Markey backed President Barack Obama's health-care law and opposes the Keystone pipeline on environmental grounds, Mr. Lynch opposed the health law and supports the pipeline. When Mr. Kerry vacated the seat in January, Democratic leaders moved quickly to coalesce around Mr. Markey in an attempt to avoid a repeat of a 2010 special election, when Republican Scott Brown unexpectedly won a Senate seat after the death of Edward M. Kennedy. Within a day of Mr. Markey's announcement that he would run, influential figures in the Massachusetts Democratic establishment had endorsed him, trying to clear the field and frighten off potential challengers. Mr. Kerry called Mr. Markey, who first came to Congress in 1976, "one of the most experienced" legislators in Congress. With Mr. Brown's upset win in 2010 on their minds, Democratic leaders are scheduled to hold a "unity" breakfast on Wednesday to begin planning their next moves. "Everyone learned that you can't take anything for granted," said Jeff Gohringer, a spokesman for the League of Conservation Voters, which has spent $850,000 so far on Mr. Markey's behalf and has organized workers to knock on voters' doors—in many cases the same people targeted in the race that put Democrat Elizabeth Warren in the Senate in 2012. Mr. Markey is popular with environmentalists, who note that he has helped write legislation aimed at diminishing climate change. Mr. Lynch, a former steelworker, had hoped to take the Senate seat by appealing to independents and conservative Democrats. Independents have the option of voting in either the Democratic or Republican primaries. Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@dowjones.com Email

Downgrade Highlights China Debt Worries
Move by Fitch Is One of Strongest Signals Loan Binge Could Threaten Recovery; Shadow Lending Is an Extra Wild Card
By
Aaron Back
Updated April 10, 2013 4:26 a.m. ET
BEIJING—Fitch Ratings Inc. lowered one of its key ratings on China's government debt, in one of the most prominent warnings to date over a credit buildup in the world's second-largest economy. The downgrade applies only to China's yuan-denominated debt, which is primarily traded domestically—not the foreign-currency debt that it issues in international financial markets, so it is unlikely to have a big impact on global financial...

IntoOutdoors will mix shopping and outdoor leisure pursuits. Above, a rendering of its 125-acre development.
IntoOutdoors Holding a fishing rod in one hand and filling your lungs with country air, the last thing you might expect to find a minute's walk away is a coffee shop and a clothing store. But at a mixed retail and leisure development set to open next year on 125 acres of English countryside, visitors will be able to fish and shop as they please. The project, known as IntoOutdoors, combines traditional stores with outdoor attractions such as two fishing lakes, a cycle track for casual riders and a skateboard park. It uses entertainment to lure customers to shopping centers, then keep them there all day and keep them spending, rather than losing business to online shopping sites. Other U.K. retail landlords have added multiscreen cinemas, Michelin-starred restaurants, hotels and even a network of country walks to their developments. "We're trying to make a living experience, rather than just a retail one," says Simon Tothill,
director of IntoOutdoors, a £35 million ($54 million) development scheduled to open in the fall of 2014 some 45 miles northwest of Oxford. "If you come here, you're going to stay for a day or even longer and you're going to have a great time. That's increasingly what people want." The project is overseen by Eagle Land, a property developer in southwestern England, and is expected to include about 30 shops and restaurants on nearly 85,000 square feet. The idea of providing an all-day experience comes from the U.S., where it isn't unusual for shopping centers to include doctor and dentist offices as well as food halls and entertainment options to complement the usual range of clothing and other retail stores. But they, too, are becoming more elaborate, and that is translating to the U.K. as well. "It used to be OK [in the U.S.] for malls to have a movie theater, but now you need one with stadium seating and a health club and restaurant on the side," says Thor Orndahl,
managing director of Prudential Mortgage Capital Co. "It's becoming even more important as you try to attract the next generation to keep shopping [in malls] rather than just buying online. It's imperative that these malls stay fresh and exciting." While the U.K. still lags behind the U.S. in mixing entertainment and retail, the pace of change is increasing as the U.K. economy continues to stagnate and consumer confidence remains low. Around 20% of new shopping center space is being leased for leisure activities, most often restaurants and cinemas, compared with 5% 20 years ago, according to Land Securities

Group PLC, a major U.K. property developer. For property developers, such changes are a way of fighting against falling property values, which fell 6% in 2012, according to Fitch research. That reflected declining sales on main shopping streets and at shopping centers as customers chose to shop online. Retailers are disappearing. Already this year, HMV, the U.K.'s last music chain, camera retailer Jessops and the U.K. arm of DVD rental firm Blockbuster have entered administration, a form of bankruptcy, while electrical business Comet and sports store JJB Sports closed their doors toward the end of last year. Although leisure tenants can pay up to 20% less in rent than traditional retailers, landlords say they are willing to accept that, reasoning that the promise of food and entertainment will keep shoppers on site and spending for longer. "Retail is not dead; it's changing," says Robert Noel,
chief executive of Land Securities, which recently bought a controlling stake in fast-growing X-Leisure, which owns multiplex cinemas, casinos and health clubs across the U.K. "People are going to shops less often, but are travelling farther, and spending more time and money when they do." Illustrating that shift toward mixed-use, developer British Land Co.

recently spent £90 million on a project in Hereford, near Birmingham in central England, that comprises 22 retail units, seven restaurants and a six-screen cinema and is to open next spring. Other developers say innovation is the best way to keep consumers interested in physical stores when online retailers are offering greater choice and often lower prices as well as same-day delivery. "We're trying to extend dwell time in a positive way," says Camille Waxer,
chief administrative officer at Canary Wharf Group PLC. The company owns 850,000 square feet of retail space around Canary Wharf, home to many of London's biggest investment banks and other financial-services companies. It plans to open a boutique cinema, live music venues and a white-collar boxing club by 2018. "We're trying to make sure our leisure offer gives people something they want in their lives, but that they haven't got right now," she adds. Write to Peter Evans at peter.evans@wsj.com Email

Speaker of the House John Boehner holds up the gavel after being re-elected on the first day of the 113th Congress on Thursday.
REUTERS The House has re-elected embattled Republican John Boehner as speaker on Thursday. The Ohio lawmaker won a second, two-year term as leader with 220 votes, losing just a handful of votes in the Republican-controlled chamber. (Photo/Video: AP)
The new Congress convened Thursday to an all-too-familiar backdrop of looming fiscal showdowns, leaving incoming members to ready themselves for the same kind of divisive battles faced by the last Congress. Signs of discord were evident in the GOP ranks as nine Republicans voted for someone other than Rep. John Boehner
(R., Ohio) to be speaker of the House. Their public defiance—votes were cast on the House floor in front of his friends and family—highlighted the challenges ahead for Mr. Boehner, days after 151 of his GOP colleagues broke with him on legislation to prevent tax rates to rise for most Americans. More on Politics The Power Brokers First-Day Impressions From Freshman Lawmakers Washington Wire: The Vote Tally for House Speaker Washington Wire: Text of Boehner's Address to the new Congress GOP Infighting Follows Scuttling of Storm-Aid Vote GOP Leaders Take Political Risk in Deal Heard on the Street: Beware the 'Washington Put' Mr. Boehner's continued struggle to unify his party marks just one of the plot lines for the 113th Congress as lawmakers wade into what is expected to be another ferocious skirmish over the cost and size of the federal government. The new Congress will soon be confronted with difficult votes on raising the government's borrowing limit, as well as on measures to deal with across-the-board spending cuts that are now scheduled to take effect on March 1 and a stopgap spending bill to fund the federal government that expires in late March. "Public service was never meant to be an easy living," Mr. Boehner said in a speech from the rostrum Thursday. "If you have come here to see your name in the lights or to pass off a political victory as some accomplishment, you've come to the wrong place. The door is right behind you." Sen. Mark Kirk (R., Ill.), who had been absent for the past year while recovering from a stroke, slowly walked up the 45 steps to the Senate on Thursday, with Vice-president Joe Biden nearby.

There were 82 new House members and 13 new senators among those taking the oath of office Thursday afternoon. They will join their veteran colleagues in what's sure to be a caustic debate to raise the debt ceiling. President Barack Obama has said he won't negotiate with Congress over the nation's statutory borrowing limit, but Republicans believe they can demand and win spending cuts "We have very few pieces of leverage that we can use by being the minority of divided government," Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.
"This is one of the obvious ones." The next Congress is likely to see the same divisions that regularly left the 112th Congress gridlocked. And incoming members, many elected by wide margins, came to Washington armed with promises to reach across the aisle—even as they outlined partisan goals Enlarge Image

Rep. Matt Salmon
(R., Ariz.) offered a dim assessment of the relationship between the last Congress and the White House. "It's like the most dysfunctional family I've ever seen," he said. "It's very frustrating that we can't put aside some of our partisan differences." At the same time, Mr. Salmon's legislative priorities—a pledge not to raise taxes, for instance—likely make compromise tough. Previously elected to Congress in the 1990s, Mr. Salmon initially abstained in the vote for speaker on Thursday to signal to leadership that he thinks conservatives haven't done enough to cut federal spending. He eventually voted for Mr. Boehner. Mr. Boehner's re-election as speaker was never in doubt Thursday, but Republican aides needed to find GOP lawmakers who had not voted and bring them to the House chamber to ensure the election wouldn't go to a second ballot. In the end, nine Republicans voted for someone other than Mr. Boehner, including three who chose Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R., Va.) and two who backed former Rep. Allen West
(R., Fla.), who was defeated in November. Rep. Steve Stockman
(R., Texas) voted "present," and two other Republicans—Reps. Raul Labrador
(R., Idaho) and Mick Mulvaney
(R., S.C.)—declined to vote, even though both were in the chamber. Mr. Labrador checked his phone as his name was called for a second time, and Mr. Mulvaney stood at the back of the chamber as the clerk read his name again. Along with the prospect of political battles, Thursday brought the ceremony of welcoming a new band of lawmakers. On the steps of the Capitol Thursday morning, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi welcomed Democratic women in the House. Sen. Mark Kirk (R., Ill.) was greeted by Vice President Joe Biden as he climbed the Capitol steps almost a year after suffering a stroke. During the vote for speaker, Virginia Rep. Frank Wolf, a Republican, perched on the edge of his chair as one of his grandchildren nestled behind him and seven others piled into nearby chairs. Some Republicans are starting to look beyond the looming budget battles to the prospect of tackling a tax overhaul and other legislative priorities. House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R., Mich.), who spent much of the past year laying the groundwork for a sweeping overhaul of the tax code, said legislation Congress passed this week to lock in income-tax rates was "only the first step." "We need to make the tax code simpler and fairer for families and small businesses," Mr. Camp said. "We need to pursue comprehensive and fundamental tax reform to make American businesses and workers more competitive in the global marketplace." —Corey Boles contributed to this article.

April 8, 2013 8:52 p.m. ET
Joba Chamberlain and his 'utterly glorious' mustache.
Associated Press The mustache debuted in spring training, but its true public unveiling came on opening day, in a cold and emptying Yankee Stadium. The Red Sox were leading and the Yankees looked old and anemic, and a late afternoon chill had brusquely turned to rain. Loyalists hoping for a rally began scrambling for the exits. They'd arrived at the stadium wanting an opening-day triumph and a ninth closed out by the elegant Mariano Rivera, now 43 and embarked upon his farewell lap. Instead they got Joba Chamberlain—and Joba Chamberlain's beautiful, terrible mustache. It was a mustache to behold. When Chamberlain revealed it upon his arrival in Tampa, it was wispy and unserious, a translucent caterpillar. But six weeks later it had evolved into something robust, almost preening in its fuzziness and breadth. This was a mustache that wanted to be seen. Already it had been compared with the mustache of a sea captain, or a Brooklyn bartender, or that of a cable repairman who wasn't really there to fix the cable. It could be viewed without assistance from the upper deck, and surely at home plate, where the unimpressed Red Sox pounded Chamberlain for another three ugly runs and rendered the Stadium silent. Yankee Day 1 had become a punch line. When the game was over, Chamberlain sat slumped at his locker, looking dejected. A mustache had been roughed up. But this was only one game. The mustache had potential. This season is an important one in the pitching life of Chamberlain, who'd shown such promise in the early moments of his career, but had become something much less promising, undone by injury and other distractions. After 79 appearances in 2010, he'd pitched in only 49 games in the following two seasons, and the thrill that once surrounded the hard-throwing Nebraskan reliever, now 27, had settled into something lukewarm. When would Joba ever be the Joba once promised? Chamberlain had been mentioned in trade gossip, and he'd growled in spring training about being a starter, episodes that only reminded how much his status had slipped. Was the mustache a signal of the old Joba swagger? It did have personality, some brio. It felt like a throwback to some bell-bottomed Yankee tradition. The club has a starchy, perplexing policy about facial hair—mustaches are OK; goatees and beards aren't—but it hasn't stopped some spectacular creativity on the upper lip. The Hall of Fame of Yankee Mustaches is remarkable: Thurman Munson, Catfish Hunter, Sparky Lyle, Reggie Jackson, Don Mattingly, among others. Goose Gossage's walrusian 'stache should be in Cooperstown alongside Goose Gossage. Cases are made for Oscar Gamble, even Steve Balboni. Billy Martin, of course. Jason Giambi tried one a few years back, mostly to ridicule. Mustaches like Chamberlain's should be encouraged. Especially now. At least it offered levity. This is not expected to a brilliant Yankee season—the team looks creaky and iffy and there are predictions of a finish deep out of the playoffs. There's not a lot of confident laughter. Granted, the Yankees are not a barrel of yuks, even in good times—the culture of the team seems permanently trapped in the turgid middle of Alec Baldwin's "Glengarry Glen Ross" speech—but humor must be welcomed amid stress. The Yankees did salute Chamberlain's mustache in March on the team's official Twitter account, describing it as "utterly glorious." Then suddenly, the mustache was gone. After another bouncy outing, this one against Detroit, Chamberlain decided to shave it Sunday. "It wasn't working, so we decided to get rid of it," the pitcher told reporters including the Journal's Daniel Barbarisi. "I figured I'd see if I had an upper lip." He said he'd done it with a trimmer before the game. "I'll shave tomorrow," Chamberlain said. And with that, another Yankee legend was consigned to history. This legend had delivered no pennants or titles, carded not one victory to its name. It did not have a baseball card or a sneaker campaign or a restaurant. (Of course it did have a parody Twitter account.) It played in no old-timers games, punched no paparazzi and never got caught leaving a nightclub at 4 a.m. It will be forgotten by May, and this feels like a New York shame. Joba Chamberlain's mustache was going places. It could have been a contender. Or at least a useful laugh.

A few states like to fancy themselves as America's basketball epicenter—Indiana, North Carolina and Kentucky, all come to mind. But in terms of producing promising high-school talent, there's an unlikely contender: Iowa. Enlarge Image

Short position
All-American nominations than any other state this year (34) and last year (36). In the past five years, Iowa, with 172 nominations, trails only big-state powers Texas (271), California (259) and Florida (225). Taking into consideration that Iowa has a population of slightly more than 3 million people, that's one All-American nomination for every 17,711 Iowans. There's one for every 143,838 Californians. But despite the success of Iowa in the initial nominations, they tend to get forgotten about when the field is narrowed down for the all-star game. In the past five McDonald's All-Star games, only two players from the Hawkeye State made the cut, including 2010 MVP and current Golden State Warriors forward Harrison Barnes. It will likely be another Iowa-less all-star game this year when McDonald's finalizes rosters Thursday. Not a single Iowan player is currently ranked in Scout.com's top 100. —Tony Olivero
