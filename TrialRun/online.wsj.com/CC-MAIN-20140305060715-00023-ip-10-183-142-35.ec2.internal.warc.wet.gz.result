   By Kristin Jones 
 Chinese money manager Noah Holdings Ltd. (NOAH) lifted its full-year earnings outlook, saying business has grown faster than expected. Noah's American depositary shares jumped 15%, to $15 in after-hours trading. The company now expects an adjusted profit of $50 million to $55 million, from its previous estimate of $33 million to $37 million. The wealth manager targets the high net-worth population in China. The company has strengthened its profit margins lately after a series of cost cuts. Chief Executive Jingbo Wang said Thursday that all of Noah's units, including asset management, its mutual fund business and its Hong Kong business had "meaningful growth" in the first half of the year. Ms. Wang touted improvements to the company's organizational structure, management and product innovation made since last year. The company will report its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 21. As of Thursday's close, Noah's ADSs had more than doubled since the start of the year. Write to Kristin Jones at kristin.jones@wsj.com Email

Life With a Hydrogen Fuel Cell Honda
The driver of an FCX Clarity tells tales of cruising Los Angeles without paying at the pump
By
A.J. Baime
Jan. 14, 2014 6:18 p.m. ET
Jon Spallino, 48, a retired investor from Redondo Beach, Calif., on his hydrogen-powered Honda, as told to A.J. Baime: When Honda put out a hydrogen fuel-cell car, I was the very first retail customer, in 2005. Since then I've signed on for a newer Honda FCX Clarity, which is only available in Southern California. The fuel is hydrogen in compressed gas form, which interacts with oxygen to develop electricity. The only emissions...

Fixed-Rate Mortgage Edges Up as Others Fall
By
Nathan Becker
Updated Nov. 5, 2010 12:01 a.m. ET
Mortgage rates mostly fell in the latest week, with short-term adjustables again hitting lows, though the average on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages edged up for the third consecutive week, according to Freddie Mac's weekly survey. The short-term rates Freddie tracks—for five-year and one-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages—hit the lowest levels since the mortgage financier began tracking them in January 2005 and...

December 19, 2011
If Twitter has not already invaded your life, get ready: It's coming to a theater near you. Last week, the Public Theater announced—via Twitter, naturally—that it would make 25 seats available for live tweeting during the first performance of "Gob Squad's Kitchen" in January. And at the Circle in the Square Theatre, the lead producer of "Godspell" is considering a secluded section of "tweet seats." Audience members, in masks, are encouraged to interact with actors and handle props at performances of 'Sleep No More.'
Reuters It could be just a phase—but then, that's what they said about Twitter. And it comes at a time when other self-indulgent audience habits have become standard. Grown men and women hide their in-show texting like 14-year-olds. Ring tones are ubiquitous—just ask Patti LuPone. As for food, Broadway theaters have allowed snacks and drinks for years, and people crunch and munch through Lincoln Center performances all the time. Taken together, it feels like we're heading toward a 21st-century version of Shakespeare's Globe: Welcome to the free-for-all! Hang around with your pals. Talk, tweet, text all you want. Bring your sandwiches—and your rotten fruit, just in case the show is a stinker. There is of course a difference between bad behavior—which theaters can't control—and legitimizing audience expression during performances, which they can. But the latter is part of an attempt to blur the lines between performer and spectator. Take "Sleep No More," the immersive theater project in which masked audience members wander through the set, fiddling with props and engaging with the performers. Or "Undivided Divided," Shen Wei's new work for the Park Avenue Armory, where ticketbuyers are encouraged to walk among 30 dancers as they perform in squares painted on the floor. Some Broadway musicals conclude with a de facto all-theater dance party that forces the audience into a standing ovation (which they'd give anyway because that's just apparently standard now). "In every aspect of life, people don't want to just sit and do nothing," said Rob Kapilow, the conductor and composer who created the "What Makes It Great?" series and book. "They want to tweet, and they want to respond. Museums are more interactive. You see reader reviews of every product. Everyone feels that they are responding to everything." Audience engagement and participation have been developing since the cultural upheavals of the 1960s, said Kristin Linklater, a professor of theater arts at Columbia. Being involved or included in the show taps into our urge for self-expression. "It's about wanting to be a part of the glamour onstage—that will make me special for a moment," she said. It's also reactive: Connecting the stage and the seats is in part designed to awaken spectators who have been anesthetized by decades in front of the television. "They're used to being passive in front of screens," said Ms. Linklater. Taking that a step further, she posited that the modern use of microphones onstage makes a performer's voice louder, but not necessarily more commanding. "It puts up a barrier because the mike is doing half the work for the actor," she said. "The engineers are doing an awful lot to manipulate the performance. [Audiences] sit back, and the miked sound comes to them." It's all a bundle of contradictions: The shows are showier, but we're more distracted, yet also encouraged to engage more. Chalk it up to the evolution of the performing arts and human behavior. How did we get here? Looking back, there have been plenty of standards for theater-going behavior, and most of them aren't as quaint as you might think. "The idea of sitting quietly in the dark—doing nothing—is recent," said Mr. Kapilow. "Concerts themselves didn't exist until the 1820s." Communicating with hand-held devices is just a modernized way of chatting, as the masses regularly did at Shakespeare's Globe: "Tweeting is the equivalent to gossiping with your neighbor," said Ms. Linklater Noshing during the show, well, that too is as old as "Romeo and Juliet." "There certainly was a lot of peanut eating in Elizabethan theater," she said. Ultimately, we may be on a course for divided theaters—not by class, as was the Globe, but by habit, like separate train cars designated for smoking, eating and sleeping, depending on one's preference. Why stop at tweet seats? There could be Eat Seats. Sneeze Seats, too, for those with colds. Maybe Breathe Right could sponsor a few Sleep Seats. Where would that leave theatergoers who just want to see a show and not be annoyed or tell their friends about it in real time? And where, for that matter, does it leave the performers? The good news, Ms. Linklater noted, is that modern theatergoing is still seen as a respectable proposition, as opposed to the Elizabethan age, when the free-for-all came with the ticket price. "Theaters were in the disreputable part of town, with pimps and gallows and bear-baiting," she said. "We've got a long way to fall." Write to Pia Catton at pia.catton@wsj.com Email
