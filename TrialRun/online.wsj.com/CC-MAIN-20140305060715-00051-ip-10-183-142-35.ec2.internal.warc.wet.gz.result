What needs to be done is not automatically raise pay of executives, with medicore results. The list is too long, but look at recent pay raise of CEO at XOM? He is a good executive, but the results aren't there. Then there is GE, FTR and a bucnh of others where increases in pay seems to be a birth right not something based on performance

Hi Fred: No, I wasn't thinking of unions, as they are in an adversarial relationship with management. I was thinking of elected management. I was wondering if this had ever been done. Dixie

What changes would most improve the corporate culture at your job??? Most upper management is appointed, if not anointed for the positions they hold. I left my job. Executive staff worried more about themselves and their futures rather than the future of the organization. People with skill and ability were fired, demoted or had their pay frozen for years. Morale sank. People left. The executives then replaced skilled and experienced workers with consultants or contractors. Institutional memory was lost. The needs of customer were forgotten. Ridiculous rules, including union rules made working impossible. Technology was seen as the savior and panacea for all organizational ills and was instituted without fully understanding business processes or the limitations of technology. More money was spent upgrading unneeded technology rather than focusing on people who know how to work. Executives were very well compensated while middle management was decimated and reduced in pay grades. Training and testing of employees for promotion was forgotten. Customers became an obstruction. Travel between business divisions was restricted and personal contacts were lost. The human factors of doing business were ended. I would fire and replace the executive staff from the CEO on down. I would fire all the consultants. I would institute new training and promotions based upon testing and performance, real results to improve moral. I would pay back all employees who lost pay because of the wage freezes. I would reduct the dependency upon unneeded and unwanted technology and replace it wherever possible with humans. I would restore customer confidence and would seek the input of our customers to see what we must do to keep them satisfied. I would also sue and claw back every dollar charged by consultants and contractors who did no work other than jam up the paper copiers and the shredders. I would recruit, fresh new college and high school students and working moms who need jobs and even provide day care for their kids. And for single dads too! I would change the entire culture of the organization and do it quickly and efficiently while gaining the trust and respect of customers and business associates. It's hard work but it can be done. I would have done that.

Wow, (and no disrespect intended) but that's a Giant sized chip you're carrying on your shoulder! Are you sure the platitudes and steps you've recommended aren't just the acceleration of "throwing the baby out with the bath water"?

Not so fast Fred. There is no baby here. Just people who are unable and also unwilling to make a commitment to a business organization and to others. They're only concerned about their pay check and retirement. They don't understand technology. They don't care about the value of the customer (no customer, no revenue). They have never been held personally responsible for bad judgement and squandering good will. I successfully ran a business for 27 years by caring for the people who worked for me and for my customers. I came last. In this organization though, so many are responsible for so little without consequences that a new culture is needed. You can't spend the day arguing with people who can't hear. You can't waste time and money and put good people at risk when many others do nothing. Time is of the essence. Sometimes, like this situation, hard choices and immediate action is required. Losses must be staunched. Confidence must be regained and leadership must take place. Change is hard work. Good leadership is even harder work. Getting deadwood out of the way is paramount. No disrespect Fred, but strong leadership has no time for platitudes. In this case, protecting the business and going forward is the objective. It takes strength, courage and commitment to engage a new vision and a new culture. That is what I would instill.

NEW YORK—U.S. Mint gold-coin sales are on track to exceed last year's totals as worries about the stability of the federal government have attracted buyers back to the market. The Mint has sold 752,500 troy ounces of American Eagle gold coins this year, just shy of last year's total sales of 753,000 ounces, according to the Mint's data....

Avant-garde choreographer Sarah Michelson at 2012 Whitney Biennial.
Paula Court '4' Whitney Museum of American Art 945 Madison Ave. (212) 570-3600 Opens Friday whitney.org With "4," avant-garde choreographer Sarah Michelson
returns to the fourth-floor gallery of the Whitney Museum for the final installment of her "Devotion" series, which features commissioned texts by Richard Maxwell.
The series' first chapter, "Devotion Study #1—The American Dancer" had its premiere in the 2012 Biennial. It made waves in part because it was the first time the Biennial featured choreography, and in part because of the punishing, relentless nature of the piece, wherein the performers walked backward in circles for the greater part of 90 minutes. Many audience members were riveted. Some walked out. There's little to no "dancey-dance" in Ms. Michelson's work; instead she's interested in the legacy of modernism, and in compelling the watcher to think about the relationships between the choreographer, the work, and the style of performance. "4" occurs at 2 p.m., and seating is limited. 'WOW' BRIC Arts Media House 647 Fulton St. (718) 683-5600 Begins performances on Thursday bricartsmedia.org Girl, you know it's true! There's a Milli Vanilli opera in the works entitled, appropriately, "WOW." Lest you've forgotten Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus's
chapter in pop culture history, the R&B duo won a Grammy award for Best New Artist in 1989, only to have it stripped when evidence emerged that the pair had not sung on their debut album. "WOW," presented at BRIC as a work-in-progress, is a collaboration between three well-regarded experimentalists: composer Joe Diebes,
poet Christian Hawkey, and director David Levine.
Their ambulatory, site-specific production takes place in a half dozen rooms in the 40,000-square-foot BRIC venue including a gallery, a black box theater and a rehearsal studio. The libretto borrows heavily from news conferences and interviews and examines labor exploitation, racism and other thorny aspects to the duo's rise and fall. LAST CHANCE: 'Parsons Dance' The Joyce Theater 175 Eighth Ave. (212) 242-0800 Through Sunday joyce.org Parsons Dance celebrates its 30th season this year. The program includes a world premiere, "The Introduction" set to Rubin Kodheli's
cello score. "Caught," a fan favorite, is also on the program. In the six minute long piece, a dancer makes more than 100 leaps but appears to be suspended in air thanks to impeccably timed lighting effects. Steven Vaughn
and Ian Spring
alternate performances. Created in 1982, it still wows. 'The Loneliness Of the Long Distance Runner' Enlarge Image
Sheldon Best, Malik Yoba and Zainab Jah in Alan Sillitoe's 'The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner.'
Kevin Thomas Garcia Atlantic Stage 2 330 W. 16th St., (866) 811-4111 Opens tonight atlantictheater.org Colin, a disadvantaged teenager stuck in juvenile detention, finds escape in long distance running in Alan Sillitoe's
1959 short story, which became a 1962 film starring Tom Courtenay.
In its theatrical adaptation by Roy Williams,
the cast is predominantly black, and story is set just after the 2011 north London riots, which were sparked by the police shooting of an unarmed 29-year-old man, Mark Duggan,
and resulted in well over 3,000 arrests. The play had its premiere in September 2012 at the York Theatre Royal—it will be interesting to see if it has as much resonance for audiences in this new American production at the Atlantic. Sheldon Best, who plays Colin, is no stranger to athletic performances, having worked with the action/adventure theater ensemble, Vampire Cowboys. Leah C. Gardiner
directs.

Colgate to Log $275 Million Charge on Venezuela Woes
By
Kevin Kingsbury And Tess Stynes Updated March 22, 2010 4:18 p.m. ET
Colgate-Palmolive Co. said it will record a charge of $275 million in the first quarter related to Venezuela's economy being deemed hyperinflationary. The consumer-products giant said the charge will reduce earnings by 53 cents a share. That's on top of the six-cent to 10-cent a share reduction to 2010 earnings the company had expected from Venezuela's currency devaluation at the start of the year. Colgate and others that...

Best Buy Leaves U.K., Reboots Phone Venture
By
Miguel Bustillo And Kathy Gordon November 8, 2011
Best Buy Co. is closing its U.K. big-box stores and paying $1.3 billion to buy out its partner in U.S. mobile-phone retailing as the electronics giant retools its struggling business to focus on smaller shops.

SEC's Hunt for Crisis-Era Wrongdoing Loses Steam
Hedge Fund Magnetar Won't Face Charges Tied to Mortgages
By
Jean Eaglesham
Aug. 6, 2013 9:14 p.m. ET
Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement officials have decided not to recommend filing civil charges against hedge-fund firm Magnetar Capital LLC, which teamed up with Wall Street firms to create mortgage securities that suffered billions of dollars in losses during the financial crisis, according to people familiar with the situation. The decision is a sign the SEC's investigations into whether companies or individuals broke the law with their conduct ahead of the crisis are running out of gas. Despite last week's...

You can tell a lot about prosperity in America by observing the places people are moving to and where they are packing up and moving from. New Census Bureau data on metropolitan areas indicate that the South and the Sunbelt regions continue to grow, while the Northeast and Midwest continue to shrink. Among the 10 fastest-growing metro areas last year were Raleigh, Austin, Las Vegas, Orlando, Charlotte, Phoenix, Houston, San Antonio and Dallas. All of these are in low-tax, business-friendly red states. Blue-state areas such as Cleveland, Detroit, Buffalo, Providence and Rochester were among the biggest population losers. Related Videos

This migration isn't accidental. Workers and business owners are responding to clear economic incentives. Red states in the Southeast and Sunbelt are following the Reagan model by reducing tax rates and easing regulations. They also offer right-to-work laws as an enticement for businesses to come and set up shop. Meanwhile, the blue states of the Northeast, joined by California, Minnesota and Illinois, are implementing the Obama
model of raising taxes on businesses and the wealthy to fund government "investments" and union power. The contrast sets up a wonderful natural laboratory to test rival economic ideas. Consider the South. We predict that within a decade five or six states in Dixie could entirely eliminate their income taxes. This would mean that the region stretching from Florida through Texas and Louisiana could become a vast state income-tax free zone. Three of these states—Florida, Texas and Tennessee—already impose no income tax. Louisiana and North Carolina, both with bold Republican governors and legislatures, are moving quickly ahead with plans to eliminate theirs. Just to the west, Kansas and Oklahoma are also devising plans to replace their income taxes with more growth-friendly expanded sales taxes and energy extraction taxes. Utah, while not a Southern state, leads the tax-cutting pack under Republican Gov. Gary Herbert. Enlarge Image
ImageZoo/Corbis Much of this is the result of GOP victories in the 2010 and 2012 elections. Today 10 of the 12 governors in the Southern states are Republican, and in nine of those states the Republicans control both chambers of the legislature. Meanwhile, the Northeast is bluer than ever. Consider Massachusetts, where only four of the 40 state senators and just 29 of the 160 House members are Republicans. In the past two elections, the GOP was crushed in Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island and Illinois. And in 2012, Democrats gained a supermajority in both houses of the California legislature for the first time since 1883. Not surprisingly, California, Illinois, New York, Oregon, Minnesota, Hawaii, Connecticut, Maryland and Massachusetts have all raised income taxes in recent years. But it isn't just higher taxes that make these so-called progressive states less attractive to business. Red states Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, West Virginia, Montana and North Dakota (and a few blue states like Ohio and Pennsylvania) are getting rich from oil and gas drilling. Meanwhile, bluer-than-blue New York has extended its moratorium on the technological advance behind the boom, hydraulic fracturing, citing overblown environmental hazards, and Vermont has outlawed it altogether. California's regulations prohibit nearly all new drilling of any kind. Moreover, the entire Northeast and West Coast is anti-right-to-work, meaning that workers employed in unionized workplaces may be required to join the union and pay dues that might go toward political causes they disagree with. Most of these blue states also have super-minimum wage laws that price low-income workers out of the job market. All the empirical evidence shows that raising a state's tax burden weakens its tax base. Still, too many blue-state lawmakers believe that a primary purpose of government is to redistribute income from rich to poor, even if those policies make everyone, including the poor, less well off. The obsession with "fairness" puts growth secondary. Meanwhile, in the South, watch for a zero-income-tax domino effect. Georgia can hardly sustain a 6% income tax if businesses can skip across the border into neighboring states like Florida, Tennessee or South Carolina. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin
has told her legislature that the Sooner State will face high economic hurdles in the future if it is an income-tax sandwich between Texas and Kansas. Last year, Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam
signed into law legislation repealing the state gift tax and phasing out the state estate tax. Next on the docket? Repealing the state's tax on "unearned income"—income from sources other than wages such as rent and investments. Increasingly, under Republican leadership, the pro-growth movement is spreading north. Over the past two years, Michigan and Indiana passed right-to-work legislation, and the latter phased out its estate tax. Ohio Gov. John Kasich
turned a $6 billion deficit into a budget surplus with no tax increases. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker
made a number of positive budget and collective-bargaining reforms and wants tax cuts this year. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback
signed into law legislation slashing the state's highest personal income-tax rate to 4.9% from 6.45%, and says his ultimate goal is to eliminate the income tax. In short, red states of the South and other areas of the country are moving forward with pro-growth tax reform, while California and the blue states of the Northeast are doubling down on Obamanomics and European progressivism. Who will come out on top? Our money is on the red states and those wisely following their lead. Mr. Laffer is chairman of Laffer Associates. Mr. Moore is a member of the Journal's editorial board.
