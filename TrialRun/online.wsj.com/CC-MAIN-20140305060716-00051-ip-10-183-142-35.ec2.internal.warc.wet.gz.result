Final Four: It's Louisville and The Other Guys

Associated Press
ATLANTA — Tip-off time is nearing. Time to see if Louisville can live up to the hype or one of those other guys can turn the Final Four into their party.
The Cardinals are not only the favorites to win the national championship, they've become sentimental favorites, as well, after rallying around Kevin Ware, the guard whose compound leg fracture in last week's regional final turned stomachs, while also warming hearts and setting the story line for this week in Atlanta.
"With Kevin going down, especially the way he did, it's just making us play harder," Louisville forward Wayne Blackshear said Friday.
In Saturday's opening national semifinal at the Georgia Dome, the Cardinals — No. 1 seeds in the entire tournament — play ninth-seeded Wichita State, which has sprung upsets of Gonzaga and Ohio State en route to that program's first Final Four appearance since 1965.
The second semifinal pits a pair of No. 4 seeds, Michigan and Syracuse, two programs with plenty of tradition but largely considered subplots in a week dominated by Louisville and Ware. (To say nothing of the news going down at Rutgers, where video of coach Mike Rice hitting players led to his ouster, the departure of the athletic director and other problems.)
"I'm just glad to know Kevin Ware now even more because he's probably the most famous person I know," Louisville guard Peyton Siva said. "You know, when you have Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama call you, it's pretty good to say you know that person."
Wichita State has one player (Carl Hall) who salvaged his career after working in a light bulb factory and two more (Ron Baker and Malcolm Armstead) who paid their way to come to school and started on the team as walk-ons. Its coach has invited fans into the locker room after big wins. In most years, this would be the school with all the makings of a team the whole country can get behind.
Problem is, in this case, Louisville and Ware are already tugging on America's heart strings.
"We're brothers for life," swingman Luke Hancock said. "I have that guy's back in any situation. I know he has mine."
Louisville (33-5) is a 10Â½-point favorite against the Shockers (30-8).
The second semifinal is expected to be more competitive. Michigan (30-7) is a 2-point favorite against Syracuse (30-9). The Wolverines are back at the Final Four for the first time since the Fab Five led them there in 1993. Syracuse returns on the 10-year anniversary of its only title, led by Carmelo Anthony.
The featured players in this game: For Michigan, Trey Burke, The Associated Press Player of the Year. And for Syracuse, well, it's coach Jim Boeheim's 2-3 zone defense.
How will Boeheim try to stop Burke, whose long-range 3-pointer against Kansas sent the game into overtime and set the stage for the Wolverines run to Atlanta?
"I don't pay attention to matchups," Boeheim said. "It's teams. Teams play."
Indeed, during interviews Friday, the Syracuse players sounded plenty confident that their team could stop Burke and the rest of the Wolverines, who followed their victory over top-seeded Kansas with a 20-point blowout of Florida in the regional final.
"It's tough to go against our zone when you've never seen it before," forward C.J. Fair said. "We want to force him to do some things he's not done before."
While Burke may be the most-watched player in the second game, all eyes figure to be on Ware in the opener, even though he'll never touch a basketball.
He lives near Atlanta and traveled with the team for the Final Four. When the Cardinals arrived Wednesday night, he was in a wheelchair and the plan is for him to be on the bench for the game.
Louisville faces some practical concerns not having Ware in the lineup.
He was the main substitute for Russ Smith and Siva, the guards who guide the Louisville press and its offense, as well.
"Our players totally understand the challenge that lies ahead with this Wichita State team," coach Rick Pitino said. "We understand with Kevin out that we not only have to play very hard, we have to play very, very smart."

As it happens, 2010 and 2011 mark back-to-back anniversaries for Gustav Mahler—the 150th anniversary of his birth in 1860 and the centenary of his death in 1911. The result will inevitably be yet more appearances of Mahler's works on concert programs. But even without an anniversary to celebrate, Mahler's music dominates the symphonic repertoire all over the world. Indeed, we have been experiencing Mahler mania for almost four decades now. In "Why Mahler?" Norman Lebrecht wonders just how Mahler came to be so popular, capturing both the imagination of music aficionados and the affection of the general public. The answer, he believes, lies in the capacity of Mahler's music to communicate the contradictions and challenges of life in the modern world. Just how Mahler's music accomplishes this feat is another question that Mr. Lebrecht's book explores, along with the details of Mahler's life and the author's own deep, personal engagement with the composer's music. During his lifetime, few predicted that Mahler would ever approach anything like popularity or critical esteem. When he died, opinion about the value of his music was sharply divided. There were those—including the Viennese composer Alban Berg and his mentor, Arnold Schoenberg—who believed that he had charted a path to the future and that his music would eventually be recognized as transcendently great. But many critics and musicians in Europe and America— including the renowned conductor Arturo Toscanini—thought Mahler's music bombastic and little more than self-indulgent rubbish. Enlarge Image
Portrait of the composer as a middle-aged man: Emil Orlik's 1902 etching of Gustav Mahler Art Resource, NY Mahler and Beyond Those who want to learn more about Mahler's life have many biographies to choose from, but the four-volume work by Henry-Louis de La Grange, published in English by Oxford University Press (1974-2008), is the preeminent study. It chronicles Mahler's life practically day by day with a remarkable array of detail, much of it fascinating and delightfully arcane. Readers can explore the testimonies of those who knew the composer by reading Norman Lebrecht's "Mahler Remembered" (1987), a collection of reminiscences. Alma Mahler's memoir, "Gustav Mahler: Memories and Letters" (1946), is filled with self-serving half-truths and lies yet it is charming and there is much in it that merits close scrutiny. And Natalie Bauer-Lechner's "Recollections" (1980) is among the most revealing, sympathetic and reliable accounts. To learn about Mahler's music, Donald Mitchell's fine books, including "The Mahler Companion" (1999), which he edited with Andrew Nicholson, merit close reading. Mr. Mitchell has long been among the most sophisticated analysts of Mahler's life and music. His account of Mahler's first symphonies and song cycles, "The Wunderhorn Years," is particularly to be recommended. The most challenging interpretation of the music remains Theodor W. Adorno's monograph, "Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy" (1992). Adorno stressed the idea that Mahler's music was unsentimental: a reaction against Romanticism and a harbinger of Modernism. In Mahler's music one encounters a persistent fragmentation of the smooth and continuous surface of symphonic sound. He employed extremes in sonority and revels in distortions and interruptions, often through the ironic use of recognizable fragments from the everyday world. For Adorno, Mahler's music was an exercise in the use of art as an instrument of ethics. Those interested in listening to Mahler's music should take comfort in the fact that any recording available from iTunes or on CD will suffice. Mahler transcends the limitations and conceits of all interpreters. His output was not massive, so there isn't that much to choose from, and his works are all easy to find. But no recording can do justice to Mahler's sound world. Readers are therefore encouraged to attend any performance anywhere that they may be able to get to. A general reader who wants to discover classical music can find a neverending supply of books in print. Among many that are worth recommending, the distinguished musicologist Joseph Kerman's textbook "Listen" (1972) stands out. For the general reader, Aaron Copland's wonderful "What to Listen for in Music" (1939, revised many times until 1988) is a terrific place to start. In the same genre but a somewhat different vein is Roger Sessions's little book "The Musical Experience of Composer, Performer, Listener" (1950). For those interested in 20th-century music, Alex Ross's recent "The Rest Is Noise" (2007) and Kyle Gann's "American Music in the Twentieth Century" (1997) are rewarding to read. When it comes to individual composers, I highly recommend, only partly out of self-interest, the series of Bard Music Festival books published by the Princeton University Press, of which there are 21 individual volumes of documents and essays that focus on composers ranging from Haydn and Beethoven to Shostakovich and Berg. —Leon Botstein
Mahler's symphonies and other major works, including such vocal and orchestral pieces as "Das Lied von der Erde" and the "Kindertotenlieder," never disappeared from the repertory, but the programming of his music increased after World War II, most notably during the 1960s, when Leonard Bernstein became Mahler's great champion, conducting his music everywhere, as well as recording it and arguing for it. As Mr. Lebrecht notes, Bernstein found in Mahler a conductor-composer very much like himself—a mirror. Mahler's music reflected back to Bernstein the image of a tortured soul: the Jew as artist, isolated in the world, struggling with matters of identity and meaning. The Mahler revival that Bernstein led soon enough became the Mahler madness we know today. More than any other composer in the canon, Mahler draws in the nonspecialist. What Mr. Lebrecht is seeking to understand, then, with his title's question, is why some music (e.g., Mahler's) reaches a wide public and becomes a key for a whole society to come to terms with life and culture. Musicians are often dismayed to discover that otherwise curious and well-educated citizens—who enjoy visiting museums, reading books and going to the theater—respond to most classical music with polite detachment, saying that they wished they "knew something about music" but confessing that they don't. This lament evokes the memory of a distant past. In the late 18th century, the age of Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven, music was indeed an art form cultivated by connoisseurs and limited to an audience that knew something about it. At the same time it was an art form that blurred the lines between amateur and professional—and between composer and performer. Most of Beethoven's patrons were amateur performers and composers, as were two monarchs of his time, Frederick the Great of Prussia and Maria Theresa of Austria. Music aficionados were almost always amateur musicians themselves—and that fact defined the way they listened. But from the mid-19th century on, the audience for music expanded dramatically—first through the proliferation of the piano in middle-class households, then through the player piano (reproducing performances mechanically), and ultimately through radio and the gramophone. In our own day this broadening of the listening audience has increased still further, thanks to the CD player, the computer and the iPod. No one seems to feel that, in order to listen, one must become literate in music in the old sense—learning to play it and write it. By the mid-20th century, in fact, all you had to do was to push a few buttons and let the sound envelop you. The first composer to write for a non-connoisseur audience was Richard Wagner, who used repetition and a wide palette of sound to illustrate events and ideas, pioneering a way of writing music that—in its attempt to present characters, emotions and ideas (such as fate)—was akin to the prose of the novels of George Eliot and Tolstoy. To frame his own achievement, Wagner (whom Mahler revered) sought to redefine the music of the past, especially Beethoven's. In Wagner's view, one didn't need to know anything about Beethoven's music to grasp its "plot" and emotional effect. The symphonies were dramas in music—what we might call film scores without a film. Beethoven's life and work became in the late 19th and early 20th centuries what Mahler has become in our own time: a touchstone, a source of personal and cultural self-definition. Like Beethoven, Mahler has bypassed the supposed difficulty of understanding music, not to mention the supposed need for the listener to tutor himself before he can grasp music's meaning. Mahler is thus today the object of an obsessive attachment for many, many people, not least for Mr. Lebrecht, a longtime music critic and the author of "The Life and Death of Classical Music" (2007), among other books. Near the end of "Why Mahler?" he confesses: "Everyone needs a personal benchmark. Mahler is mine." He then elaborates on the "sheaf of truths and ideals" that Mahler's music has taught him, including: "that every child stands a chance; that love can wait; that the difference between ordinary and excellent is the last degree of effort; that the best is never good enough; that striving is all." And some people think that classical music is irrelevant! The philosopher Martha Nussbaum has made similar claims, saying that Mahler "expresses the thought that one may simply overcome primitive shame and stand forth in one's own being." So too did Lewis Thomas, the writer-physician, in "Late Night Thoughts on Listening to Mahler's Ninth Symphony" (1983), where he confessed that he had come to hear "the end of humanity" in Mahler's last completed symphonic work. The difference is that Mr. Lebrecht knows not only Mahler's music but a great deal about the composer himself, having published a fine, annotated compilation of reminiscences and documents, "Mahler Remembered" (1987). In "Why Mahler?" readers will find a compelling biographical sketch of Mahler's life, from his seminal student years in Vienna through his burgeoning career as a conductor and, finally, his ever more consuming ambitions as a composer. Mr. Lebrecht stresses Mahler's psychological struggles—he was notably given to fits of despair and arrogant impatience—and his Jewishness, an identity that brought him ambivalent memories, notoriety and opposition, especially during his years as director of the Vienna Opera (1897–1907), when racialist political anti-Semitism was ubiquitous.

Associated Press Why Mahler? By Norman Lebrecht Pantheon, 326 pages, $27.95
Mr. Lebrecht's "search for Mahler" includes a perceptive but devastating portrait of Mahler's widow, the notorious Alma, known for her many husbands (including the architect Walter Gropius and the writer Franz Werfel) and many infidelities. It includes as well an account of the author's conversations with the composer's surviving daughter, the sculptor Anna. Along the way we meet performers and friends of Mr. Lebrecht's, including Gilbert Kaplan, an avid Mahler enthusiast, amateur conductor and the founder of Institutional Investor magazine. Mr. Kaplan has put extensive resources into Mahler advocacy, helping to underwrite the publishing of books on the composer and facsimiles of his scores. Mr. Lebrecht's mix of scholarship, biographical narrative, music criticism and memoir makes "Why Mahler?" an unusual sort of tribute. Certainly the integration of Mr. Lebrecht's personal experiences points toward the challenge of writing about classical music for the general reader these days. The fear that the audience for serious music is dwindling can sometimes invite an overemphasis on the top-hits fragment of our musical heritage, including Mahler's. The performing repertoire is getting smaller and smaller, to the point where we may need reminding that there is more to music than Mozart, Beethoven and, yes, Mahler. Here I wish that Mr. Lebrecht had done more. In nearly 300 pages, he gives short shrift to other composers, offering fairly brief sketches (and lukewarm characterizations) of figures who were influenced by Mahler or inspired by him or who were important to Mahler's artistic development. It is certainly true that Mahler's "time has come," and "Why Mahler?" is grounded in that inescapable fact. But one can't help feeling, at the end of Mr. Lebrecht's investigations, that it may be time to move on—time to turn to other music of the present and the past. We do a disservice to Mahler by putting him on a pedestal, not least by overplaying him (something that happened to Beethoven during the 19th century). Excessive repetition of even the greatest music can be a form of homicide. One striking—and troubling—aspect of Mr. Lebrecht's chronicle is the importance he gives to recordings, an importance that inevitably raises the question of whether recorded performances have influenced our attitude to Mahler's music and that of many other composers. Although Mr. Lebrecht recommends hearing Mahler in live performance, one senses that his passion for Mahler is linked to his experience of listening to the composer's music with headphones or in front of loudspeakers. The world in which Mr. Lebrecht came of age was dominated by the belief that recordings can be a fair, even superior, representation of a musical work, offering up a model or correct version of a piece of music by avoiding the unpredictable character of live performance. Mr. Lebrecht demurs now and then, but it is clear that his allegiance is to recording as the authentic source of musical knowledge. Throughout the book he characterizes dozens of recordings of Mahler's works, often with slash-and-burn criticism ("every sound" in Pierre Boulez's performance of the Sixth Symphony is "strung out like entrails on a mortician's table") and sometimes with bouts of adulation that suggest the ideal of a definitive or "best" account. But a recording cannot adequately deliver the full content and emotional impact of any piece of music. Indeed, a recording is to a live musical performance what a small reproduction in an art-history textbook is to a painting. This is particularly true for Mahler's music, whose vast sonorities and scale defy all the efforts of modern technology. Contrary to Mr. Lebrecht's implicit assumptions, classical music works best as a unique event in real time and space—an acoustic encounter between performers and listeners. Each performance is different, and each, in its different way, yields ultimately to the many-sided power of the score. That is how we think of Shakespeare and Ibsen—whose work comes alive differently at each moment onstage—so why not Beethoven and Mahler? The great thing about music is that the value of a live experience rests as much on listeners as it does on performers. Music performed is an unstable art, and we should be glad that the texts that inspire it remain intact to see another day. When Mr. Lebrecht is at his most fiercely judgmental he can write as if music was a fixed thing—a matter of true and false, right and wrong. But it is not. Readers of "Why Mahler?" will know far less than he does about both the past and the present of music and will be grateful to Mr. Lebrecht for his enthusiasm and for his highly personal cultural history, but they may want to investigate Mahler's music for themselves—preferably in a concert hall and not through headphones. —Mr. Botstein is the president of Bard College, the musical director of the American Symphony Orchestra and the editor of the Musical Quarterly.

What would posesses a person to buy a $1,200 chicken coop, or a $45 white-enamel pail? Outdoorsy activities are getting a high-end makeover and consumers are flocking to the trend. WSJ's Anne-Marie Chaker and Terrain Brand President Wendy McDevitt join Lunch Break with details. Photo: Terrain.
Can chicken feed, canning jars and garden hoses feel chic? Absolutely, say retailers cashing in on the "modern homesteader" craze. As more urban and suburban homeowners take up backyard farming, items like chicken coops, beehives, gardening tools and pickling and canning supplies are getting more stylish and pricey.

launched its Agrarian line, which features a $1,300 chicken coop and a $500 beehive. "We've definitely seen the shift," says Rob Ludlow, owner of BackYardChickens.com, an online community of about 170,000 chicken enthusiasts. "People wanting to be self-sufficient and eating locally grown food is synonymous with people who are affluent." Homesteaders say their back-to-the-land activities go beyond mere hobbies and provide emotional nourishment and a certain inner peace. Eliza Zimmerman, 55, and her husband, Peter, a 57-year-old architect, tend vegetable and herb gardens and three beehives on their 10-acre property with an 1890s farmhouse in Chester Springs, Pa., outside Philadelphia. On the agenda for spring: chickens. Williams-Sonoma sells a $1,300 cedar chicken coop.
Williams Sonoma "It's what I did with my grandmother—the chickens, the gardening, the canning, the bees," Ms. Zimmerman says. "It is my Zen—a memory of what made me feel safe and good and warm." And jars of homemade honey make great gifts, she adds. Modern homesteading style shares some of the spirit of the shabby chic interiors of the 1990s, when chipped-paint furniture and tea-stained fabrics conveyed a desirable aged patina. The homestead aesthetic is more than visual, though, encompassing a range of do-it-yourself activity, like brewing beer, pickling vegetables and making cheese. Beekeeping clubs are getting lots of buzz and new members. Hundreds of local restrictions on backyard chickens have been lifted in the past five years as a result of public pressure, says Barak Orbach, a law professor at the University of Arizona, who has studied the phenomenon. More people aren't just growing their own vegetables, but canning and preserving them, too. Fifth Season Gardening, a Carrboro, N.C.-based chain, specializes in home brewing.
Fifth Season Broadly defined, it is a consumer segment with an estimated $200 billion in retail sales, which also includes annual spending on organic-labeled food and environmentally-friendly household products, says Charlie Hall, horticultural economist at Texas A&M University in College Station. This consumer is typically a 30- or 40-something homeowner motivated largely by the desire to live more simply and healthily, he says. These people "have a willingness and ability to pay," Dr. Hall says, whether it's $70 for Williams-Sonoma's "vintage" watering can ("scuffs, scratches and other signs of use add to the character," the retailer says) or $40 for a bag of soy-free chicken feed at Fifth Season Gardening Co., a regional chain based in Carrboro, N.C. The Agrarian line from Williams-Sonoma—part do-it-yourself supply cabinet, part collection of rustic accent pieces—zeroes in on an artfully weather-beaten look. A pine-and-metal "vintage Biergarten table" sells for $600; a "found" enamel pail for $50. (The company says these items aren't copies but rather actual pieces it found by scouring European villages. Items may not be identical and may be available in limited quantities, the company says.) The Agrarian line is meant for people "who want to embrace the homegrown and the homemade into their everyday lives," says Allison O'Connor, vice president of merchandising. There is an intentional mix of price points, she says, such as an $11.95 herb-garden kit. The company says it plans to double the number of products in its Agrarian line and publish a stand-alone catalog. Terrain's copper thermometer, top ($58), and mirrored trivet sets ($98).
Terrain Fifth Season's five stores in the Carolinas and Virginia sell gardening supplies and chicken feed, as well as kits for making sake wine and chevre cheese and cultures for yogurt, kefir, sour cream and buttermilk. The shopping floor is appointed with terra cotta planters and stone statuary; classes have ranged from home-brewing to bonsai. Elizabeth Galindo Roberts, a film costume designer in her 50s, moved to a new home in Carmichael, Calif., about a year ago. She and her husband installed a vegetable and edible-flower garden, including nasturtiums and violas. She keeps five chickens in two custom-built coops. The couple hired interior designer Kerrie Kelly, from nearby Sacramento, to design the interior of the four-bedroom ranch. The look "feels perfect, but it's so imperfect," Ms. Kelly says. Dining-room chairs are upholstered with mismatched fabrics; wall art hangs in frames of assorted styles. Furniture leathers are distressed, and windows are framed with open-weave linens. "Ten years ago, people were opening up Architectural Digest and saying, 'We want that.' " Ms. Kelly says. "Now there is such an authenticity to everything we are designing." Urban Outfitters says its Terrain garden centers target women ranging from their mid-40s to mid-60s. "One of the things we'd been discussing is the boomer lifestyle," says Richard Hayne,
chief executive of the Philadelphia-based company, whose Urban Outfitters chain caters to college-age hipsters and Anthropologie stores targets fashionable young homeowners. "We realized there's another leg to this story," Mr. Hayne says, referring to the spending potential of well-heeled women whose children are grown. "Their demand and desire for apparel wanes," he says. It's "a lifestyle concept. Terrain inventory ranges from a $228 metal-roof birdhouse and a $148 woolen throw to a $269 tailored gardening jacket. A section of the store is devoted to beauty and bath products, including a $38 scrub presented as a "hot toddy for the body." Terrain's store in Glen Mills, Pa., features a restaurant, in an antique greenhouse brimming with ferns, that specializes in locally-sourced food. It has a following with groups of women who meet for lunch and shop. Mr. Hayne says he is looking to add a spa. The store provides workshops on things like terrarium gardening and Japanese "kokedama," hanging plants that appear to float, free of containers, from the ceiling. "We'll open more stores," Mr. Hayne says. "We're taking our time growing the concept and learning it." Write to Anne Marie Chaker at anne-marie.chaker@wsj.com Email

Updated Nov. 27, 2007 11:59 p.m. ET
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -- Last fall, groups who favor placing disabled students in regular classrooms faced opposition from an unlikely quarter: parents like Norette Travis, whose daughter Valerie has autism. Valerie had already tried the mainstreaming approach that the disability-advocacy groups were supporting. After attending a preschool program for special-needs students, she was assigned to a regular kindergarten class. But there, her mother says, she disrupted class, ran through the hallways and lashed out at others -- at one point giving a teacher a black eye. "She did not learn anything that year," Ms. Travis recalls. "She regressed." As policy makers push to include more special-education students into general classrooms, factions are increasingly divided. Advocates for the disabled say special-education students benefit both academically and socially by being taught alongside typical students. Legislators often side with them, arguing that mainstreaming is productive for students and cost-effective for taxpayers. * * * Plus, read more about trends in integrating special-needs students, at WSJ.com/Mainstreaming.
Some teachers and administrators have been less supportive of the practice, saying that they lack the training and resources to handle significantly disabled children. And more parents are joining the dissenters. People like Ms. Travis believe that mainstreaming can actually hinder the students it is intended to help. Waging a battle to preserve older policies, these parents are demanding segregated teaching environments -- including separate schools. 'Fully Included' In 2005, more than half of all special-education students were considered mainstreamed, or "fully included," nationally. These students spent 80% or more of the school day in regular classrooms, up from about a third in 1990, according to the U.S. Department of Education. "The burden is on school districts and states to give strong justification for why a child or group of children cannot be integrated," says Thomas Hehir, an education professor at Harvard and former director of special education at the U.S. Department of Education. That point of view frustrates many parents. Some have struggled to get services from their local school districts; others have seen their disabled children falter in integrated settings. Mary Kaplowitz, a special-education teacher in Kingston, Pa., was a bigger supporter of mainstreaming before she had her son, Zachary, who has autism and is mildly retarded. She says his preschool classmates rarely played with him and he came home from summer camp asking why the nondisabled children laughed at him. On a visit, she saw them drawing away from her son. "They shunned him and it broke my heart," says Ms. Kaplowitz. Earlier this year, she and other parents fought successfully to preserve separate special-education classes in Kingston like the one Zachary, now 9 years old, attends at a local elementary school. Such parental pushback has prompted local school districts across the country to delay or downsize mainstreaming initiatives. Last year, parents of disabled kids in Walworth County, Wis., clashed with an advocacy group over the creation of a new special-education school. As part of the battle, Disability Rights Wisconsin sued the county in Milwaukee federal court to try to block the school. The new school is currently under construction and the lawsuit is under appeal. And earlier this year, parents in Maryland's Montgomery County asked the state to continue a special-education program their school district was scheduled to discontinue. After initial protests, the district agreed to phase out the program -- letting enrolled kids continue -- rather than close it outright. The debate has grown contentious in New Jersey, a state with a strong tradition of separate education for the disabled. Only about 41% of the state's 230,000 special-education students are deemed fully included, compared with 54% nationwide. About 9% of the state's disabled students -- triple the national average -- attend separate schools. New Jersey passed some of the nation's first special-education laws. In the 1950s, it began requiring public schools to pay for special-ed services that they didn't offer. State law also gave counties and groups of school districts broad powers to build stand-alone schools for the disabled. Today, there are 80 publicly funded separate schools for the disabled in New Jersey and about 175 private ones. They receive tuition from public districts for handling special-ed students. But in 2004, the state, which had faced federal pressure to mainstream, placed a year-long moratorium on the opening of new special-education schools. Since then, it has stiffened the approval process for private facilities and bolstered funding for local districts to broaden in-house programs. In a budget-strapped state where voters have been demanding tax relief, cost has been a factor. On average, New Jersey spends about $16,100 a year on each special-education student, including those who are mainstreamed. The average annual tuition at the various, separate public schools for the disabled range from $28,500 to $42,000; at private schools, it's $44,000. Overall, tuition and transportation costs for out-of-district placements accounted for 39% of the $3.3 billion a year that the state spends on special education. "That's a huge cost driver for our education budget," says state Sen. John Adler, who last year co-chaired hearings on school funding reform. Many parents, including state Sen. Stephen Sweeney, bristle at moves that could foreclose their options. His daughter, Lauren, who has Down syndrome, attends a regular middle school. But Mr. Sweeney says her nondisabled classmates never visit or ask her to hang out. Next year, he's moving Lauren to a separate high school operated by the publicly funded Gloucester County Special Services School District. The system's special-education facilities also include a new $14 million school for children with autism and multiple disabilities. 'The Choice of Parents' "Just to put my child in a building to make people feel better because it's inclusion is outrageous," says Mr. Sweeney. "As long as I am in the legislature, they are not going to take away the choice of parents with children with disabilities." The school funding hearings, held in various towns and cities last fall, were emotional. Ruth Lowenkron, a special-education attorney, testified that beyond being the right thing to do, mainstreaming would save money. "Repeat after me," she told the legislators, "inclusion is cheaper than segregation." But the panel also heard often from parents who argued for continued access to separate schools. They included Adela Maria Bolet, of Teaneck, N.J., whose suit-clad son, Michael, sat beside his mother while she testified. The 17-year-old, who has Down syndrome, now attends a private high school on the state's tab. In earlier years, Ms. Bolet fought to get Michael into regular public schools only to find that he sometimes became depressed and had little positive interaction with nondisabled peers. Until high school, he had few friends, says Ms. Bolet. Her voice still quivers when she talks about what happened when the family rented a pool in town and invited classmates from Michael's neighborhood elementary school to a swimming party for his 13th birthday. "Nobody came," she says. Concurrent with the funding hearings, another debate was boiling at New Jersey's publicly funded Middlesex Regional Education Services Commission. It had already supported and built a network of six special-education schools, and planned to open two more, including a 24-classroom facility. The commission, controlled by a consortium of school districts, had built its other schools using bonds guaranteed by Middlesex County's governing board. Its school projects had never faced significant opposition. This time was different, as the proposed schools became a target for mainstreaming advocates. Critics like William England, a school board member in South River, N.J., wrote to local papers. To endorse the sort of segregated special-education schools that most of the country is busy abandoning would be "a waste of county resources," he said in a letter to the Home News Tribune, East Brunswick, N.J. Mark Finkelstein, the Middlesex commission's superintendent, scoffs at such criticism. He estimates his schools save local districts $10 million a year over the cost of placement in privately owned facilities. "It's easy to say that all kids should be in mainstream schools but let's talk reality," he says. On a recent morning at the Bright Beginnings Learning Center -- one of the Middlesex schools -- a hallway painted mint-green was lined with children's wheelchairs and walkers. In one classroom, a teacher and four aides were working with seven disabled students, most strapped into devices designed to help them stand or sit. Mary Lou Walker, an aide, crouched beside the desk of Teresa Condora, a petite 7-year-old who suffers from cerebral palsy and is largely nonverbal. "All right T, come on," Ms. Walker said, gently urging the girl to press a big red plastic button attached to a buzzer. Responding with a soft moan, Teresa pushed against the button as though it were impossibly heavy. Factions Face Off Last September, pro- and anti-mainstreaming factions faced off at a meeting where the fate of the proposed new Middlesex schools was to be decided. At the microphone that evening, Paula Lieb, president of the New Jersey Coalition for Inclusive Education, cited multiple examples of severely disabled children who had been successfully mainstreamed. She said that "the vast majority of children can be included in the public schools." But the parents of children already attending the commission's schools had also been organizing, urging each other to come to the hearing and bring their disabled children. Sandy Epstein's family had moved to New Jersey from Oregon a decade earlier to take advantage of specialized schools for students like her son, Brandon, who has autism. For the hearing, the 48-year-old homemaker dressed her teenager in a bright red polo shirt and sat near the front. "I wanted him to stand out," she says. "I wanted these politicians to see what we are talking about." Ms. Travis, a 41-year-old bookkeeper from Milltown, N.J., says that while waiting to speak that night, she grew angry with the criticisms of the inclusion advocates. She thought they had no idea what her daughter Valerie, now 11, needed. The Travises had spent eight months on a waiting list to get Valerie into the Academy Learning Center, one of the Middlesex schools located in Monroe Township, N.J. During that time, she says, the progress Valerie had made learning to speak all but disappeared. Along with reports of her outbursts at school, Ms. Travis says the family had to cope with frequent meltdowns at home. Valerie slept fitfully, ripped up her homework and beat up her little brother to the point that he once needed stitches. "It was the worst eight months of our lives," Ms. Travis told the county officials, adding that families like hers needed schools like the Academy, where Valerie is now learning geography and double-digit subtraction. Mr. Finkelstein believes parents' testimony helped convince county officials to unanimously back the bonds needed for the new construction, which is under way. "If inclusion worked for all of our residents," the superintendent says, "they wouldn't be fighting so hard for these new schools." Their efforts are far from over. In June, a coalition of disability-rights groups sued the New Jersey education department in U.S. District Court in Newark. Taking a page from the racial desegregation battles of the 1960s, it alleges the department isn't moving fast enough to integrate disabled students and asks the federal court to take over the process.
