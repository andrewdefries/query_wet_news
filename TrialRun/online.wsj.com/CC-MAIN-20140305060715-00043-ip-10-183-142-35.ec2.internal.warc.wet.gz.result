A convenience store in Glenwood, Ark., flooded by the Caddo River.
Associated Press Heavy overnight rains sent a surge of muddy water coursing through campgrounds in western Arkansas before dawn Friday, sweeping away dozens of people along with tents, RVs and parts of cabins. The flash floods killed at least 16 people, many of whom had been camping by the Caddo and Little Missouri rivers in the ruggedly scenic Ouachita Mountains. An unknown number of people were still missing Friday afternoon, and the death toll was expected to rise, said Bill Sadler, a spokesman for the Arkansas State Police. Enlarge Image
Chad Banks, left, Lorraine Smith and Joe McBay rest at a church near Caddo Gap after being rescued from a campground.
Associated Press There was a continuing search "for individuals who may be stranded or bodies that may have washed up on the banks" of the rivers, Mr. Sadler said. He said patrols had no idea how long their search through the muddy, debris-strewn forest would continue. "We entered this operation not knowing who was in there, how many were in there, and where they might be," he said. The Little Missouri is normally a placid river, just three to five feet deep this time of year. But by 5:30 a.m. Friday, it had risen to 23 feet and over-topped its banks. Authorities and local residents said the campers were probably taken by surprise by the torrent of water. "This one was pretty quick and pretty devastating," said Chris Warren, who rents a cabin on the Caddo River to vacationers. He lost some fencing to the floods but the cabin, which sits on stilts seven feet above the ground, survived intact. "It's like a thief in the night. The people didn't have any warning," said Jeff Cunningham, owner of Wolfpen Campgrounds, which is about 14 miles away from the flood zone and didn't get hit. The hardest-hit campground, the Albert Pike, is a popular vacation spot for families, who return year after year to hike and fish and buy ice cream from the campground store. The area is also home to some permanent residents, who live in mobile homes and RVs along the river. The American Red Cross estimated that 200 to 300 people were sleeping in the area when the flash floods hit. The heavily wooded site is tucked into a valley surrounded by three mountain ranges, which makes it beautiful but vulnerable, as storm runoff from the higher elevations inevitably flows down into the valley. A road leading to a flooded campground was blocked by police.
Associated Press "It's like a big funnel," said Mr. Cunningham of Wolfpen Campgrounds. "Any water coming out of that watershed has to run right through that campground." No permits or registrations are required for the Albert Pike campgrounds, which are part of the National Forest system, making it hard for authorities to know how many victims might still be missing or in need of rescue. Cellphone service in the area is limited. The National Guard sent three helicopters to help with rescue efforts and state police hurried to set up an information center for relatives. "We've got 12 families right now who say they've got children in the area," Mr. Sadler said. "We're trying to establish a location so they can see whether their loved ones are accounted for or not." The American Red Cross was providing counselors to help the families through the anguished wait for news. "People are in shock," said Brigette Williams, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Little Rock. Write to Stephanie Simon at stephanie.simon@wsj.com Email

Business & Finance *** The IMF said China needs to revamp its banking system so that it relies more on market mechanisms, such as interest rates, to head off a "build-up of financial-sector vulnerabilities." China's current-account surplus fell sharply in the third quarter, adding to evidence the nation is shifting away from a reliance on exports and undermining the case for a faster yuan rise. Bond traders demanded the highest yield premiums since the euro's inception to hold French, Spanish and Belgian debt instead of German Bunds. The European Commission failed to agree on a key proposal that would allow temporary bans on sovereign-debt ratings under certain circumstances. UBS named Sergio Ermotti as its permanent CEO and announced plans to move up the arrival of a new chairman by a year. Credit Suisse took a big step in plans to boost profitability of its private-banking activities, saying it will fold its Clariden Leu subsidiary into the rest of the bank. Temasek and some Chinese institutional firms are among a group of investors in talks to buy the 10.4 billion shares in CCB that Bank of America is selling. China has started a new round of inspections aimed at strengthening the monitoring of rare-earth mineral production. Sony, Toshiba and Hitachi signed a contract to integrate their businesses of making small-to-midsize display panels used in smartphones and tablets. U.S. officials urged China to address the network-security and privacy concerns of Western companies, saying the rise of network-based services conflicts with Chinese restrictions. Kingfisher's chairman called on the Indian government to allow foreign carriers to invest in India's ailing aviation industry as his own airline tries to extricate itself from a severe financial crunch. World-Wide *** Dozens of soldiers and security forces were killed by suspected army defectors in southern Syria, as President Assad increasingly appears unable to manage the crisis, activists said. Afghanistan's Karzai is seeking to bolster his negotiating position in talks with the U.S., at a meeting of delegates from the provinces. Chinese artist Ai Weiwei bowed to Beijing authorities, depositing $1.33 million in a tax case he says is politically motivated. North Korea upset Japan 1-0 in a historic football match. Email

Updated June 2, 2009 12:01 a.m. ET
BEIJING -- Two gauges of China's manufacturing activity showed continued expansion in May, mainly due to the government's stimulus package. The expansion came despite recent fears in the market of an imminent slowdown and helped to boost Asian stock markets on hopes of a sustained economic recovery in the world's third-largest economy. Component subindexes May April Output 56.9 57.4 New orders 56.2 56.6 New Export orders 50.1 49.1 Backlogs of orders 48.8 48.9 Stocks of finished goods 46.2 44.8 Quantity of purchases 55.8 56.2 Imports 49.4 50.0 Input prices 53.1 51.3 Stocks of purchases 46.1 46.9 Employment 49.9 50.3 Suppliers' delivery time 50.2 50.6 China's official purchasing managers index, issued by the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing, was 53.1 in May, down from 53.5 in April, the third month the indicator has stayed above 50, after remaining below that level for five consecutive months. A PMI reading above 50 indicates growth, while a reading below 50 indicates contraction. Meanwhile, the CLSA China PMI, compiled by U.K.-based research firm Markit Group Ltd., rose to 51.2 in May from 50.1 in April, marking the second consecutive month the CLSA PMI was above 50, after eight months below the key level. "Although we believe external demand continued to be weak, this is more than offset by the strong growth in domestic demand, especially fixed-asset investments," Goldman Sachs economists said in a note on the official CFLP PMI reading. However, they cautioned against interpreting the reading as a clear signal of strong economic growth, citing its divergence with industrial production data in April. Commodity stocks gained on the Asian markets Monday as the readings underpinned hopes of a global demand recovery. In China, PetroChina
