US Approval of LNG Exports Paves Way for Asian Spot Market

   By Mari Iwata 
 TOKYO--Japanese liquefied natural gas buyers see U.S. government approval for an LNG facility in Texas to export gas to countries with which it doesn't have free-trade agreements as a step forward in the creation of a spot market for the clean-burning fuel in Asia. Cargoes from the Freeport LNG export terminal "will help bring about structural changes to the Asian LNG market," a Chubu Electric Power Co. (9502.TO) spokesman said Monday by telephone. Freeport LNG has signed preliminary 20-year contracts to sell the supercooled gas to two Japanese buyers--Chubu Electric and Osaka Gas Co. (9532.TO). The deal was contingent on government approval for non-FTA countries, including Japan. Optimism in the U.S. over the prospect of energy self-sufficiency after domestic natural gas production surged in recent years thanks to new drilling techniques quickly gave way to concerns about a glut that was driving prices lower, then hopes that new markets could be tapped in Asia, where the price of gas is a multiple of the fuel's price in the U.S. But the future of exports hinges on government approval of around a score of applications from projects eager to export to non-FTA countries, and the Freeport approval is being interpreted as a sign of further openness. For Asian buyers, the shift could mean an end to reliance on inflexible long-term contracts that commit them to receive practically all the cargoes they have agreed upon, with no reselling permitted. Freeport LNG doesn't commit importers to resell unneeded volumes, which could be a game-changer in Asia, where traditional contract terms have restrained the development of a spot market. The viability of the Freeport deal "will give us more bargaining power in talks with other producers," an Osaka Gas Co. (9532.TO) spokesman told The Wall Street Journal. Chubu Electric and Osaka Gas signed contracts last summer to use Freeport's liquefaction facility, with each committed to use of 2.2 million metric tons of its LNG capacity a year to process natural gas they buy in the North American market. Osaka Gas also has a 10% stake in Freeport LNG Development, the facility's operator. Freeport is the second LNG project the Obama administration has approved for exports to non-FTA countries after the Sabine Pass, La., which it approved in May 2011 and is slated to start exporting in 2015. The $10 billion Freeport LNG project is scheduled to start commercial operations in 2017. Japan Research Institute Senior Economist Mitsuo Fujiyama said the Freeport approval augurs well for a spot market with sufficient liquidity to sustain itself. "For it to come to pass, participation from existing LNG sellers such as Qatar, Russia and Australia will be necessary," he said. Other Japanese LNG buyers have contracted with separate LNG projects--subject to U.S. government approval--on terms similar to those agreed upon between Freeport and its Japanese customers. Japan is the largest Asian importer of LNG, but by no means the only energy-hungry country in the region with an interest in a spot LNG market. Singapore received its first commercial delivery of LNG early this month and plans to nearly double its throughput capacity to six million metric tons a year by the end of this year--and add an additional 3 million tons a year in an unspecified time frame. Recently, the International Energy Agency pointed to Singapore, Japan and South Korea as places in Asia well-suited to become gas trading centers. Write to Mari Iwata at mari.iwata@wsj.com Email

WASHINGTON—France's president arrived in Washington on a visit aimed at deepening cooperation with the U.S.—particularly over the Middle East and Africa—and smoothing past points of disagreement that have created friction between the two countries. The U.S. and France have collaborated on diplomatic efforts in Syria and Iran, and the U.S. has provided limited support to French action against jihadist groups in Mali. But there have also been hiccups in diplomacy recently, including President Barack Obama's
last-minute decision to back off military action in Syria, and Secretary of State John Kerry's
recent scolding of French companies that sent executives to Tehran. But as the White House made final preparations for President François Hollande's
two-day stay, senior administration officials underscored areas of agreement, saying the U.S.-France alliance has grown "by leaps and bounds" over the past several years. "Let's just say that we've come a long way from 'freedom fries,' " said a senior administration official. More Hollande Takes Pro-Business Agenda to U.S. Hollande Prompts a Shuffle at White House U.S. officials described France as both a trusted partner and a friend, while still emphasizing that action such as the pursuit of business opportunities in Iran could have consequences. "Frankly, any activity to conduct business in Iran that contravenes our sanctions will be viewed by the United States as sanctionable activity," the senior administration official said. "That's not unique to France. That runs across the board." For their part, Messrs. Hollande and Obama betrayed no hint of discord as they touted their close working relationship in a joint op-ed published Monday in the Washington Post.

"A decade ago, few would have imagined our two countries working so closely together in so many ways," they wrote. "But in recent years our alliance has transformed." The two presidents recast any previous divergence on Syria, writing that the credible threat of force had paved the way for a plan to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons. Senior administration officials said Monday that Messrs. Hollande and Obama would talk about ways to increase humanitarian aid in Syria and to coordinate support for moderate opposition there. Mr. Fabius, the French foreign minister, said Monday that France had renewed the push for a draft United Nations Security Council resolution submitted by Western powers last week, demanding all parties allow humanitarian aid into besieged areas that have become a major flashpoint in Syria's civil war. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney
said the Obama administration supports a humanitarian resolution in principle and would work with Security Council member states on the issue. Mr. Hollande's visit began Monday afternoon with a quick trip to Monticello, the residence of Thomas Jefferson in Charlottesville, Va. Senior administration officials said the outing was intended to highlight the two countries' historic ties and shared values. Jefferson, a devoted Francophile, served as minister to France. The two presidents were set to meet Tuesday at the White House, with a state dinner planned for the evening. —Stacy Meichtry and Inti Landauro contributed to this article.

WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama
plans to announce Monday that he is nominating former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel
to be his next defense secretary in the face of intensifying opposition from Republican lawmakers, administration officials said Sunday. Those officials acknowledge they have a bruising confirmation fight ahead. They also say they are confident they will prevail because Republicans ultimately won't be able to topple a former colleague, a Vietnam veteran and a two-term GOP senator from Nebraska who served on the foreign relations and intelligence committees. Mr. Obama also may announce his nominee to head the Central Intelligence Agency, a position left vacant when David Petraeus resigned last year after admitting to an affair. The two leading candidates for the post are White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan and acting CIA Director Michael Morell. Republican lawmakers on Sunday stepped up their opposition to Mr. Hagel, who initially voted for the Iraq war but grew to oppose it and who supported Mr. Obama for president in 2008. Critics also have cited Mr. Hagel's past criticisms of Israel as a basis for their opposition. Sen. Lindsay Graham (R., S.C.) said Sunday on CNN that it would "probably be a bridge too far" for him to support Mr. Hagel. Mr. Hagel's foreign policy views, he said, are "outside the mainstream," and he would be "the most antagonistic secretary of defense towards the state of Israel in our nation's history."

"He has consistently advocated weakness with respect to our enemies, with respect to the nation of Iran," Mr. Cruz said on Fox. "Weakness in a secretary of defense invites conflict, because bullies don't respect weakness." Mr. Hagel's backers say he will respond to charges he isn't sufficiently supportive of Israel by pointing to votes he made in the Senate for a total of $38 billion in aid for the Jewish state, along with multiple trips to meet with leaders there. Mr. Hagel, said a person close to the decision-making process, believes in America's "special relationship" with Israel, but also believes that relationship enables officials from both governments to "speak frankly" with each other. Regarding Iran, Mr. Hagel voted at least three times for sanctions and is a supporter of multilateral sanctions, the person said, adding that Mr. Hagel has opposed some sanctioning based on specific details, not a broader opposition to sanctions. Mr. Hagel believes that military action should always be an option but, based on his war experience, believes it should only be seriously considered after diplomatic options are exhausted, this person said. The monthlong lag between the initial floating of Mr. Hagel's name for the post and Monday's expected announcement has provided opponents with ample oxygen for a strong fight. While a number of former high-ranking national-security officials have voiced support, backers on Capitol Hill were reluctant to campaign hard for someone who had yet to be nominated, said one person close to the process. The Republican National Committee also joined the fray Sunday, firing its initial shots against Mr. Hagel and indicating the opposition is increasingly organized. Mr. Hagel already has been openly criticized on the airwaves by the Emergency Committee for Israel, an issue-advocacy group that criticized Democrats during the 2012 campaign. Opponents also have been quick to circulate additional ammunition for their cause, such as an Iranian PressTV report Sunday headlined, "Obama expected to nominate anti-Israel Hagel as secretary of defense." One of the chief reasons Mr. Obama chose Mr. Hagel is his willingness to buck his own party in opposing the Iraq war, a senior administration official said. The position plays well to Democrats, some of whom have been critical of his potential nomination. Mr. Hagel's views on Afghanistan and the drawdown of troops there also dovetail with Mr. Obama's, and overseeing the final phases of the war may be the most important task the next secretary of defense faces. It was vital to Mr. Obama that he have someone in that position whose views are aligned with his own on Afghanistan. Another key reason Mr. Obama is willing to spend political capital on Mr. Hagel is the president wants a Republican in his cabinet, said the person familiar with the process, and there are few open positions to fulfill that goal. Defense has been a problematic area for Democratic presidents, and the White House feels Mr. Obama benefited from initially having Robert Gates, a Republican, in the slot because it gave him some political cover with GOP critics. Mr. Obama is less likely to back down in the face of opposition to Mr. Hagel after losing the nomination of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who withdrew from consideration for secretary of state in the wake of GOP criticism. The White House plans to push back by casting Mr. Hagel as a decorated war hero with two Purple Hearts and underscoring that he would be the first enlisted military member to run the Defense Department. Crucial for Mr. Hagel's nomination will be the extent to which Democrats back him to offset Republican criticism. The White House intends to make clear Mr. Hagel apologized for a comment he made opposing an openly gay ambassador nominee about a decade ago. Officials also will stress the president is confident that Mr. Hagel will complete the implementation of the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell," the policy banning gays from serving openly in the military. A senior administration official said Mr. Obama would not have chosen Mr. Hagel unless he had been assured he would see through the implementation of "don't ask, don't tell." The White House also intends to push back against critics of Mr. Hagel's positions on Iran and Israel by stressing that he will be responsible for carrying out the president's policies. Supporters of Mr. Hagel noted Sunday that the top Republican in the Senate, Sen. Mitch McConnell
(R., Ky.) refused to voice opposition to Mr. Hagel, whose national-security expertise he has praised in the past. "I'm going to wait and see how the hearings go and see whether Chuck's views square with the job he would be nominated to do," Mr. McConnell said on ABC, where he pledged Mr. Hagel would receive "a fair hearing" from Senate Republicans. Still, marshaling the votes to back the controversial nominee will not be easy. A senior Republican aide on Capitol Hill said he didn't think Mr. Hagel would garner much Republican support and predicted as many as 15 to 20 Democrats would have difficulty voting for him, especially those who are facing re-election in 2014 and worry about upsetting the powerful pro-Israel lobby. Democrats and their independent allies hold 55 seats in the new Senate. Administration officials said they believe they can gain majority support, and they don't think that Republicans would go so far as to block consideration of the nomination entirely.

Syria vowed to defend itself against any foreign attack, while the Arab League said that Damascus had used chemical weapons against its population. Meg Coker reports. Photo: AP.
DAMASCUS—Arab leaders said Tuesday that Syria had used chemical weapons against its population, while Western governments discussed military responses to the attacks, bolstering the case for U.S. military strikes against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
The Arab League demanded an international response to what it called the "heinous crime" of last week's alleged chemical attack near Damascus that activists and rebels said left more than 1,000 Syrians dead. But the U.S.'s major Arab allies have stopped short of offering public support for a strike without international backing, reflecting broad unease in the region about another Western military intervention.

"Don't expect a big cheer from us," said Abdulkhaleq Abdullah, a political-science professor in Dubai, of the likely response from the region. "If the results are fine, and the damage is very limited, I think that is gonna be a good sign. Maybe, 'Wow, give America a D.' " The U.S. is examining ways to attack Syria without the approval of the United Nations, where Russia would likely veto any military action, U.S. and European officials have said. The Obama administration has recently stepped up contacts with North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Arab League allies about supporting a military operation against Damascus. On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel
spoke with his opposites in France and the U.K., according to defense officials. The U.S. Defense Department has presented military options to President Barack Obama,
Mr. Hagel said, without outlining them. Defense officials have said the U.S. is considering cruise-missile strikes from navy ships in the Mediterranean. "We are ready to go," Mr. Hagel said. Arab League delegates on Tuesday urged the U.N. Security Council, rather than the West, to take "deterrent" action against Syria to prevent a repeat of alleged chemical attacks on Aug. 21 in the suburbs of Damascus. During his Tuesday briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated the President's confidence that the Syrian government used chemical weapons on August 21. He also said that options for a response do not include regime change.
Even Saudi Arabia and other countries that have helped arm, train and fund rebels fighting Mr. Assad have declined to offer public endorsement for any Western-led attack. While senior Saudi officials have been urging the U.S. and others behind the scenes to support tougher action in Syria, according to officials, Arab leaders for more than a year have publicly maintained that any international military action there should be sanctioned by the Security Council. A harder line emerged from some Western capitals. France's President François Hollande
vowed Tuesday to "punish" the Assad regime. "This mass chemical massacre cannot go unanswered," he said. Addressing ambassadors at the Élysée Palace, Mr. Hollande pressed his case for the West to respond to the attack with "necessary force" targeting the Assad regime. He hinted that France was open to supporting a military strike without a Security Council resolution—a step that French officials had previously said would be essential. "International law must evolve with its times. It can't be a pretext for allowing massacres to be perpetrated," Mr. Hollande said. The U.K. military is drawing up plans for a possible response to the alleged attack, the government said Tuesday. But Prime Minister David Cameron
said any British action in Syria would have to be legal, proportionate and specifically about deterring future global chemical-weapons use. "This is not about getting involved in a Middle Eastern war or changing our stance in Syria or going further into that conflict," he said in a recorded interview with BBC television. "It is about chemical weapons. Their use is wrong and the world shouldn't stand idly by." On Tuesday, Vice President Joe Biden
said there was no question that the Assad regime was behind the attack. "There is no doubt that an essential international norm has been violated," Mr. Biden said at the American Legion's annual convention in Houston. "No one doubts that innocent men, women and children have been the victims of chemical-weapons attacks in Syria. And there is no doubt who is responsible for this heinous use of chemical weapons in Syria: the Syrian regime." U.S. officials have said they expect to release evidence in coming days that Syria's regime was behind the attacks. Enlarge Image

In its fight against rebels, the Syrian government is using social media to do everything from disparage enemies to tout President Bashar al-Assad. Here's a quick look at their online methods.
Syria "utterly and completely" rejects the allegations that it used chemical weapons, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem
said on Tuesday. He added that Syria would defend itself by means available. "We will surprise others" planning to attack Damascus, he said. "We are hearing the drums of war," Mr. Moallem added. "They want to attack Syria. I believe to use chemical weapons as a pretext is trite and inaccurate." Syria's foreign minister condemned the U.S. for flouting international law and ignoring a continuing U.N. investigation into the incident, which has yet to determine whether chemical weapons were used.

In Cairo, Egypt Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy appeared to side against intervention, saying on Tuesday, "The solution for Syria must be diplomatic, not militaristic." Turkey, in a newspaper interview by Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu published Monday, became the first major Muslim Middle East ally of the U.S. to announce it would join an international military coalition against Syria, even without advance U.N. approval. The weakest Arab states, Lebanon and Jordan, particularly fear possible retaliation and a further deluge of Syrian refugees in the event of a Syria strike. A meeting of U.S., Saudi, and other Western and regional top military officials in the Jordanian capital on Sunday and Monday was devoted mainly to reassuring Jordan of protection in the event of any disruption following a strike on Syria, as well as to try to plot responses to any further alleged use of chemical weapons by Syria, according to officials in Jordan and in the Gulf familiar with the proceedings. In Jordan, where a U.S.- and Saudi-backed effort is helping train Syrian rebels, Jordanian King Abdullah publicly called for peaceful settlement. Jordan already has taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria. Its fear is being "dragged into retaliation and war," a senior Jordanian official said. Saudi Arabia—for more than a year the strongest advocate of international action on Syria—has limited its public response to last week's alleged chemical attack to statements by Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal calling for unspecified, decisive action under the U.N. A Saudi cabinet statement repeated that position Monday night, after the U.S. made clear it was considering a military strike on Syria. "Not yet," a Saudi government spokesman said, when asked if the government had said if it would support a military strike on Syria. In principle, and in private, Saudi Arabia probably "would support any act to stop that war, or stop the use of gas," said Anwar Eshki, a former adviser to Saudi Arabia's council of ministers, or cabinet, and the head of a Saudi-based strategic research center. Mr. Eshki was referring to the use of poison gas. A U.N. team is currently in Damascus investigating the suspected chemical-weapons attacks that hit several towns on the capital's outskirts last week, whose victims included children and women, according to witnesses. On Monday, the U.N. was granted access to one of those sites, Mouadhamiya, to conduct interviews with survivors and take soil samples, although their convoy was fired on by unknown snipers earlier that day. A second trip planned by the U.N. team was canceled Tuesday after a disagreement by rebels over how to provide security to the international inspectors, the foreign minister said. The U.N. said that its team decided to postpone its visit by one day "in order to improve preparedness and safety for the team," but didn't speak to Mr. Moallem's claims. Access to the areas has been complicated by a Syria military operation—code-named Operation City Shield—that kicked off just hours after the first reports that toxic gas was killing residents. For months, Syrian forces have successfully fought to regain control over the suburban regions surrounding the capital Damascus. The Eastern Ghouta region where the suspected chemical attack occurred is the last remaining area not under partial or total regime control. Mr. Moallem, the foreign minister, said that the government launched a "pre-emptive strike" before rebels made claims about chemical weapons use last week. He said that the government had intelligence showing that rebel fighters trained outside Syria were amassing in that district "to raid Damascus." The military's assault was before Aug. 21, when the chemical attacks were alleged to have occured, but he declined to specify when. Security officials previously said the strike was in the first hours of Aug. 21 and that rebels had been planning a massive attack on Damascus from four different fronts. Mr. Moallem said the current government operation in Damascus would continue and would not be affected by plans by the U.S. and its allies to attack the regime. "The military effort won't stop, they are dreaming if they want to limit the victories of the armed forces," said Mr. Moallem. —Nour Malas and Stacy Meichtry contributed to this article.

Budget Questions For Treasury Pick
By
Damian Paletta
Jan. 11, 2013 2:21 a.m. ET
WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama's nomination of close adviser Jacob Lew as the next Treasury secretary elicited little opposition from Republicans Thursday, but many signaled they would use the confirmation process to grill him about the administration's future tax and spending plans. One of Mr. Lew's primary tasks is likely to be helping shape a deficit-reduction package with Congress in the coming months, followed by a tax-code overhaul later this year. The White House wants any deficit-reduction package to include...

Putin Says NSA Leaker Must First Stop 'Harming' the U.S.
By
Gregory L. White and Alexander Kolyandr Updated July 1, 2013 4:19 p.m. ET
Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency staffer who has sought political asylum in Russia amid espionage allegations, is welcome in the country only if he stops his disclosure of alleged abuses by U.S. intelligence agencies. But Mr. Putin reiterated that Moscow won't accede to U.S. requests to hand over Mr. Snowden, who faces charges of espionage for revealing details of...

Updated Nov. 13, 2012 6:47 p.m. ET
The International Monetary Fund, criticized for decades for prescribing harsh medicine to heavily indebted governments, is pressing reluctant euro-zone governments to go easy on Greece. It is a fight the IMF will be hard-pressed to win. It is scaling down the money it lends to Greece, and, as it does so, its influence weakens. It has lent Greece about €22 billion ($28 billion), and has set aside another €26 billion to lend until 2016. The country's main creditor group—the 16 other euro-zone governments led by Germany—are calling most of the shots. IMF officials have repeated that they want to see a realistic agreement in place to back up the release of a new slice of Greek aid. The institution has become increasingly skeptical about the euro zone's prescription of slashing budgets to get debts under control because it has exacted a heavy toll and destroyed economic growth. Enlarge Image
It also argues that the credibility of Greece's economic program—and returning the economy to health—hangs on getting Greece's debt down to manageable levels. Many in the organization see the IMF's own credibility on the line. Its main sanction—pulling out of the Greek program—would deal a confidence-shattering blow to the effort to control the debt crisis across the euro zone. The euro-zone governments' priority is very different: to minimize the cost of aiding Athens. They refuse to extend more loans to Greece beyond those already pledged. Now Greece's largest creditor group after a private debt restructuring this year, the governments are also refusing to countenance the IMF's favored solution of "official-sector involvement," or OSI—jargon for cutting the debts they are owed by Athens. After months of simmering below the surface, the divisions surfaced in public on Monday night. After attending a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde
made clear the Washington-based institution's concern about Greece's heavy debts. Sitting to her right at a news conference, Jean-Claude Juncker,
the Luxembourg prime minister who presides over the ministers' meetings, made equally apparent his view that the route to OSI, arithmetically the easiest way to reduce Greece's debts, is closed. Mr. Juncker said creditors would probably agree to move back to 2022 the date when Greece's public debt falls to the supposedly sustainable level of 120% of annual economic output. Ms. Lagarde begged to differ. "What we regard as critical…is that the Greek debt be sustainable. In our view, the appropriate timetable is 120% by 2020," she said. That way, the country would get back on its feet and return to private debt markets quicker. Many experts are skeptical that Greece will be able to repay its debts under any of the current proposals. Although his country is resisting debt concessions, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble
admitted Tuesday that even making the claim that such a high debt load eight years down the line was sustainable for Greece posed "a certain challenge." The differences over the release of the next slice of Greek aid—which Mr. Schäuble said could be as much as €44 billion—provide insight into one of the most complicated aid programs in history. Not only must Greece deal with the demands of the IMF and other governments, but the European Central Bank also has a say, along with the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm. That makes finding compromise among the creditors enormously difficult, and to many of their arguments Greece is a mere spectator. One senior European official said any deal must meet three criteria that often conflict: the aim of governments to keep concessions to Greece to a minimum, the IMF's concern about its own credibility, and the desire to make the final agreement believable to financial markets. Some analysts doubt that the disagreements will hold up the next portion of aid, which should be formally agreed upon by finance ministers by the end of the month. That will go to a vote in as many as seven national parliaments, including Germany's, before it can be paid out, probably in December. However, the issue of Greece's heavy debt burden is unlikely to go away. Mujtaba Rahman,
an analyst at the Eurasia Group in New York, said the IMF efforts will pave the way for an assertive push for official debt relief next year. "The IMF is preparing the ground for the next conversation when the Greek problem resurfaces. They recognize there's no serious appetite for official creditor write-downs among euro-zone countries at this point," he said. Underneath all these technical discussions is a country awaiting aid. Greece avoided a default on its debt Tuesday when it successfully, and with the ECB's sanction, auctioned Treasury bills that will allow it to repay some maturing debts. Waiting for aid, the government has managed its finances by delaying payments to suppliers. According to a draft report from the commission, the Greek government's unpaid bills to suppliers totaled €8.3 billion at the end of September, up from €6.7 billion at the beginning of the year. Taxpayers are owed another €738 million in late refunds. Meanwhile, as the economy enters its sixth year of recession, the governing coalition in Athens has bled support in recent weeks as the Greek Parliament has passed measures, including more budget cuts, to secure the aid payment. That may be building up risks for next year. "The political necessity for creditors to get this program back on track is clear, but there is a trade-off. By leaning this hard on the government now, coalition stability is likely to be more tenuous throughout next year," Mr. Rahman said. —Gabriele Steinhauser and Matthew Dalton contributed to this article.

Inside the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan on a recent Thursday, a jury began its deliberations with the general impression that Bruce Bent Sr. and his son, Bruce Bent II, had committed fraud.
