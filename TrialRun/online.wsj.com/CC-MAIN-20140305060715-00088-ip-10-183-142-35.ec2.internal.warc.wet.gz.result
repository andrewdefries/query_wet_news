HONG KONG—Hundreds of flights were canceled Sunday as Severe Typhoon Usagi made its way toward China's southern coast and Hong Kong. Enlarge Image
Passengers rested at Hong Kong's international airport as flights were cancelled in anticipation of Typhoon Usagi on Sunday.
Reuters Hong Kong's observatory raised the storm category to a signal 8—essentially shutting down the city—at 6:40 p.m. local time. Operations at the city's airport came to a standstill as weather conditions worsened. More Hong Kong Braces for Typhoon Usagi T yphoon Usagi Leaves at Least Two Dead in Philippines Travelers were stranded from Helsinki to Sydney as airlines canceled 177 arriving flights and 193 departure flights at Hong Kong airport as of 10 p.m., according to the city's airport authority, while another 64 were delayed. Most other scheduled flights, including those operated by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.

and its Dragonair unit, have been suspended since early evening. Cathay Pacific said flight disruptions will likely continue into Monday. "Cathay Pacific will only resume operations when it is safe to do so," it said. Enlarge Image
Chinese fishing boats are anchored on Saturday at the harbor in Xiamen, southeast China's Fujian province, following a typhoon warning. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Several airlines rescheduled flights earlier Sunday to avoid cancellation. Many others are advising travelers to defer nonessential travel. Air traffic is heavy this holiday weekend as many residents of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan return home following the Mid-Autumn Festival. Joseph Tung,
executive director at Hong Kong's travel industry council, said many residents took trips to Taiwan, Japan and Southeast Asian countries for the long weekend. He expects many will be stranded. "It's unprecedented that major airlines have announced across-the-board cancellations of their flights a day ahead of the storm's arrival," said Mr. Tung. View Slideshow
A woman and child held their umbrellas tight against powerful gusts of wind as Typhoon Usagi approached in Taipei, Taiwan, Saturday.
Chiang Ying-ying/Associated Press As the streets in downtown Hong Kong grew quiet, scores of people swamped the counters at the airport, trying to find passage out of the city. Numerous lines snaked around the terminal, with some travelers playing cards while others napped or drank beer. Li Tingting,
35, who had been on holiday in Hong Kong, came to the airport at 7:30 a.m. to try and reschedule her canceled flight home to Taiwan. "Originally I'd planned to go to Japan for the Mid-Autumn Festival, but I didn't go because I heard there'd be bad weather there," said Ms. Li. "Now I'm sorry I didn't go." American chef Tim Jacob
was among the many travelers who had arrived at the airport Sunday to try and rebook his flight—scheduled to leave Monday—after getting a perpetually busy signal over the phone. Mr. Jacob said he was struck by locals' matter-of-fact attitude toward the storm. "I lived in South Carolina, and when a hurricane came through it was kind of a big deal. But people here say, 'Seriously, we're not worried about it.' They say, 'Your houses are made out of wood—ours are made of cement. We're used to it.' " Among the stranded families was Najm Mohammed
and his wife, who sat slumped on a pair of airport trolleys after hearing their flight home to Yemen was canceled. "My wife is four months pregnant and there isn't any space around for her to sit," said Mr. Mohammed, gesturing at the benches crammed with frustrated travelers around him. "I don't know what we'll do tonight." Outside the city, more than 500 Hong Kong residents in 20 package tour groups organized by Hong Thai Travel Services, the city's biggest travel agency, were scheduled to return Sunday but have been stranded due to the storm. "We're in discussions with airlines to fly them back once air traffic gradually returns to normal," said Jason Wong,
general manager at Hong Thai. He noted that up to 30 outbound tour groups, involving another couple hundred travelers, are scheduled to depart Sunday and are also suffering delays. Many Hong Kong-bound travelers are figuring out other options to help expedite their journeys. In Helsinki, where flag carrier Finnair

has canceled Saturday's flight to Hong Kong, dozens of affected passengers have been provided free accommodation, and the option to be rerouted to another Finnair destination in Asia. The airline operates a transit hub in Helsinki for travelers between Europe and Asia. Eva Lee,
a Hong Kong nurse who was touring the Scandinavian region with her friends for the past two weeks, said she plans to first fly to Bangkok and find another flight back from there. "I don't want to be passive and stay here to wait." "We would prefer to take some risks though we don't know what will happen next," said Ms. Lee, who will have to pay for her own way home from Bangkok. Back in Hong Kong, ferry and land transport services were also severely impacted by the storm. All ferries, including those operating to mainland China and Macau, were suspended Sunday evening, as well as nearly all local bus routes. Subway and light rail services, meanwhile, operated with reduced frequencies, according to rail operator MTR Corp. But the train company says if the weather deteriorates, it may suspend services in sections running above ground. —Chester Yung in Helsinki contributed to this article.

One Cheer for Corruption in India
For the indigent and unemployed, bribery is a way to share in resources long plundered by the better-off
By
Pankaj Mishra
March 22, 2013 7:32 p.m. ET
I paid my first bribe at 18. As an undergraduate in the late 1980s, I often traveled by train to a library in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and one of the poorest. Ticketless, like most of the other indigent student travelers, I would follow the ticket conductor on his rounds, trying to dodge him. And then one morning I got caught. My panicky visions of a few days in some squalid prison lasted all of two minutes. After the exchange of a few meaningful glances, I found myself standing in...

AFP/Getty Images Activision, based in Santa Monica, Calif., said the $500 million in global retail sales came after millions of fans had attended more than 16,000 midnight openings for the game at retail stores world-wide.

's action-adventure game "Assassin's Creed III," to reverse a protracted slump in retail-videogame sales that has led to overall sales contractions for nearly a full year. Analysts have blamed both a lack of new titles and stale videogame hardware for the falling sales, saying new consoles like Nintendo's Wii U should help to energize customers. "One month of contraction is not a good thing, and we've been swimming upstream in this category since December," Paul Raines,
chief executive of GameStop Corp., said in a recent interview. The lack of certainty around customer interest in both the Wii U and traditional videogames has made investors nervous, however, leading shares of Activision to have fallen by more than 10% and stock in Electronic Arts Inc.

to have declined by more than a third so far this year. "Even the analysts can't forecast this business—it's unbelievable," Mr. Raines added. Regardless of overall industry sales, concerns over whether the latest in a string of annual installments for "Call of Duty" could perform have been calmed for now. Last year's "Call of Duty" title, "Modern Warfare 3," rang up $400 million in sales in North America and the U.K. during its first day on the market. That game went on to top $1 billion in sales within its first 16 days, beating a record set by the box-office sales of "Avatar," the feature film that reached that milestone within 17 days.

Unmeltable, Uncrushable: The Holy Grail in Painkillers
By
Timothy W. Martin and Jonathan D. Rockoff Updated May 5, 2013 9:18 p.m. ET
The arms race to build a safer painkiller is under way. In the wake of a key decision by the Food and Drug Administration, more than a dozen pharmaceutical companies—from startups to Pfizer Inc.—are vying to create painkilling drugs that are difficult to abuse. The FDA moved last month to block the manufacture and sale of generic versions of the original OxyContin, which has gone off patent but which is easier to abuse than...

MADRID—Hundreds of thousands of people fed up with government spending cutbacks and corruption scandals rallied across Spain on Saturday, many of them demanding that Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy step down and call new elections. A noisy but largely peaceful gathering of about 100,000 in central Madrid was the largest single anti-government protest since allegations of secret payoffs to Mr. Rajoy and other leaders of the ruling Popular Party surfaced late last month. Smaller rallies were held in Barcelona, Valencia,...

You don't have to be a senior citizen to get "senior" discounts. There are plenty of discounts available on a variety of products and services—like hotels, car rentals, dining and retail—for the 50-plus set. Enlarge Image
Ryan Heshka AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, makes available a host of such discounts to its members, who must be age 50 and above. And the older you get, the more the discounts pile on from individual retailers, other businesses and even the federal government. Here's a look at the discounts you can get before you turn 65: 50 and Over The bulk of the discounts that become available at age 50 are through AARP (in which membership costs $16 a year for an individual or a couple). Among the deals: Car rentals: Get up to 25% off at Avis, Budget and Hertz. Hotels: Get up to 20% off at Sheraton, Westin and Ramada hotels. It's up to 10% off at Hyatt, Best Western and Comfort Inn hotels, among others. Entertainment: Get four Live Nation concert tickets for the price of three. Take 15% to 20% off Cirque du Soleil shows. Get a 32-ounce soft drink and a 64-ounce popcorn for $5.50 (about half off) at Regal Entertainment Group movie theaters. Restaurants: At Dunkin' Donuts, get a free doughnut when you buy a large beverage. Take 25% off at Papa John's pizza restaurants. Get coffee for $1 at Denny's and take 20% off the full menu from 4 to 10 p.m. Essentials: Take 10% off mobility equipment at Walgreens, 30% off glasses made with your prescription at LensCrafters, 20% off Teleflora flowers, and 15% off UPS shipping products and services. Take 20% off Sleepy's mattress purchases of $399 or more (with some exceptions). In most states, you can get a free 45-minute legal consultation (in-person or by phone) through Allstate Insurance and a 20% discount on attorney fees. You can also save 10% on ADT home security systems. Similar discounts may be available through other membership groups, including AAA. If you are a member of multiple groups, compare the discounts available for each. 55 and Over At 55, a few more restaurant chains, retailers and at least one hotel chain kick in: AARP members get 10% off at Chili's, 10% off and 50-cent coffee at participating Arby's, and a free drink at some Wendy's. Starting at this age, there are also many discounts that don't require an AARP membership: Shopping: Ross Dress for Less stores offer 10% off purchases every Tuesday when you join their free Every Tuesday club, and participating Hallmark stores also offer a 10% discount one day a week (check with your local store). Pathmark has a 5%-off-$30 discount every Tuesday. Take a 10% discount at Goodwill one day a week (the day varies by location). IHOP Restaurant offers a 55-plus menu with smaller portions and lower prices. And get at least 10% off Best Western hotels. 60 and Over At 60, you earn more discounts on restaurants, entertainment and shopping. Movies: AMC Theatres offers a discount on Tuesdays (the amount varies). Regal Entertainment offers up to 30% off ticket prices. Food: Take 10% off at Burger King. Get 5% to 15% off at Applebee's with a free Golden Apple discount card (at participating locations). Most Ben & Jerry's offer a 10% discount. And get 10% off at participating Subway and Dairy Queen restaurants. Shopping: At Publix, get 5% off every Wednesday (outside Florida only). Take 10% off at Gristedes supermarkets on Tuesdays. Kohl's offers a 15% discount on Wednesdays. 62 and Over When you turn 62, you'll save on travel and hospitality. Get 15% off on Marriott and Holiday Inn Express hotels. Save 15% on Amtrak (with some exclusions) and get 5% off Greyhound. You're also now eligible for an America the Beautiful senior pass, which, for $20 by mail (or $10 when purchased in person), provides free lifetime access to federal recreation sites including national parks, as well as discounts on expanded fees at these sites—on campgrounds, cabins and guided tours, for example. Once you hit 65, of course, you're officially a senior citizen—and eligible for a spate of senior rates across the country, on everything from movie tickets to museum admission. Corrections & Amplifications Rite Aid pharmacies do not have any age-specific discount offers for customers 55 and older. They do, however, have discounts for shoppers who are members of a free Rite Aid rewards program for persons 65 and older. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said there were discounts for shoppers 55 and older. Email
