Trinidad de Leon, 93-years-old, takes a walk on Thursday around his Oceanside, Calif., neighborhood with his daughters Maria, left, and Ofelia.
Sandy Huffaker for The Wall Street Journal Trinidad de Leon is 93 years old. After decades spent toiling in California's sun-baked cauliflower and strawberry fields, his skin has grown leathery; he has shrunk slightly; and his hearing has declined. But according to his daughter, he is stronger than his eight children put together. "He takes two walks a day" in his Oceanside, Calif., neighborhood, added 57-year-old Maria de Leon. "Alone." Why Hispanics such as Mr. de Leon—often poor, uneducated and without health insurance—live long and strong has long confounded health professionals, scholars and other experts. This week, the first official life-expectancy data released for U.S. Hispanics shows they outlive whites by 2.5 years and blacks by almost eight years. The life expectancy for Hispanics is nearly 81 years, compared with 78 years for whites and almost 73 for blacks. As a whole, people in the U.S. can expect to live 77.7 years, according to the report from the Centers for Disease Control. "The findings can imply the Hispanic population is healthier overall" than whites and blacks despite its low socio-economic status, said Elizabeth Arias, lead author of the report. Some experts warn, however, that as immigration slows and assimilation increases, the Hispanic advantage may not last forever. While there is no conclusive explanation for Latino longevity, possible factors are related to migration, culture and lifestyle. One theory holds that immigrants consist of a self-selected hearty group, who were prepared physically and mentally to journey to a new land and thus tend to be healthier than their brethren back home. Indeed, U.S. Latinos live four years longer than Mexicans and two years longer than Cubans, according to Pan-American Health Organization data. About two-thirds of all U.S. Latinos are of Mexican origin. Hispanics are now the country's largest minority and fastest-growing group, representing 15% of the U.S. population. About 40% of them are immigrants. Another theory holds that U.S. Hispanics live longer than whites and blacks because they are more likely to eat a healthy diet, get exercise and belong to a supportive social network. "Many Hispanics are poor and not well educated, but they typically eat home-cooked food and do physical labor," said J. Mario Molina M.D., chief executive of Long Beach, Calif.-based Molina Healthcare Inc., which caters chiefly to low-income patients. Mr. Leon, who came to the U.S. at age 35 with no formal education, subsisted on beans, corn and a "little meat" for most of his life, according to his daughter. Picking fruits and vegetables, despite being arduous, helped him stay in shape. The term "Hispanic epidemiological paradox" was coined in 1986 by Kyriakos Markides, a professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Texas, after he found low mortality rates and positive health outcomes among Hispanics in the Southwest. Back then, "it seemed paradoxical that a population so disadvantaged could live so long and be relatively healthy," he said. Early this decade, studies in California by David Hayes-Bautista, a professor at the UCLA Medical School's Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture, found similar patterns. "For the first time now we have decent national estimates that support what we have suspected for a long time," said Prof. Markides in reference to the CDC reports. "Hispanics can live a long time." But the phenomenon may not have staying power. The Latino health advantage over whites and blacks in the U.S. may diminish or disappear altogether as immigration declines and successive Hispanic generations assimilate more and more. Research has shown that U.S.-born Hispanics have worse health outcomes than foreign-born Hispanics, including a higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity. They are also more likely to smoke, drink and use illegal drugs. Teenage pregnancy is more common among U.S-born Latinas than Latina immigrants. "As people become acculturated they adopt American ways: They become more sedentary and eat fast food," said Dr. Molina. "You look more American the longer your family has been here." Mr. de Leon's wife, who died four years ago, lived to 87. Several of their eight children have diabetes, said his daughter Maria. His grandchildren enjoy Mexican food, just like their grandfather. "But they love hamburgers and they eat TV dinners," said Ms. de Leon. Write to Miriam Jordan at miriam.jordan@wsj.com Email

Updated June 28, 2010 12:01 a.m. ET
In each generation, there are moments of history that people remember vividly. Some such moments are confined to national experience—in Britain, the death of Princess Diana, or the resignation of Margaret Thatcher—but some have a global impact. On Sept. 11, 2001, I was in the House of Commons in London. I watched on television as the second plane smashed into the South Tower. My disbelief turned to horror. This was not an accident, but a well planned and executed attack against a highly symbolic target. Not an attack against individuals, and not against the United States alone, but against all free peoples. The smouldering ruins of the World Trade Center marked the graves of more than 2,500 people. The carnage did not discriminate between nationality, color or creed. It changed the lives of thousands of families and it changed the way political leaders saw the world. In Afghanistan today, the NATO-led operations are a direct consequence of 9/11, with troops from 46 countries, including 9,500 British forces. The Taliban gave al Qaeda sanctuary and allowed it to run terrorist training camps from Afghanistan. Now, though driven out of power, reduced and under considerable pressure, al Qaeda and their backers in the Taliban continue to pose a real threat on both sides of the border with Pakistan.

Getty Images Afghanistan is where the will of the international community is being tested and it is where the sacrifice continues to be significant. The brunt is being borne by America, but there are grieving families in countries across the coalition. It is understandable that our democratic societies question whether the sacrifice is worth it. We need to be clear about our objectives, and clear about how we will achieve them. We must not confuse the reason we are in Afghanistan—to deny terrorists a safe haven—with the way in which we will succeed: building an Afghanistan that is strong enough to resist on its own. We must remember that Afghanistan, just as Iraq, is not a classic war of attrition—this is counter-insurgency, and it will not be won by military means alone. There is no group of commanders sitting patiently in a tent awaiting a delegation under a white flag offering a formal surrender. This is about reducing the threat to a level that the Afghan government can manage on its own, without the risk to the outside world that we saw graphically at 9/11. Our mission is focused on creating a stable enough system of security and governance to achieve this. With Pakistani forces bearing down on terrorists and extremists on their side, al Qaeda and their Taliban supporters are taking a considerable hit. As the forces of the coalition surge and the Afghan National Security Forces grow and become more effective, the challenge is being taken into the remaining strongholds of the Taliban-led insurgency. But our opponents are determined, motivated and adaptable. They will continue to test themselves against the surge in international troop numbers, seeking to prove their relevance and resilience. We can expect ground to be contested across Afghanistan, and, sadly, we can also expect more casualties across the coalition. We must hold our nerve and maintain our resilience. If we want people to pay the price of success, we must spell out the cost of failure. If NATO left Afghanistan now, the Taliban would wrest control of parts of the country and al-Qaeda and their terrorist training camps could return. It would be a shot in the arm to violent extremists everywhere. Instability could spread across this volatile region. Failure would also damage the credibility of NATO, which has been the cornerstone of the defense of the West for the past half-century. We would be less safe and less secure, our resolve called into question and our cohesion weakened. In the capitals of the coalition, we must recognize that tactical set-backs are not strategic defeats; that progress will be incremental, where there are more good days than bad; and that our impatience to see our troops come home should be subservient to the needs of national security. As a coalition we need to have clear messages for the Afghan people, and those messages need to be communicated by our deeds as well as our words. We are neither colonizers nor occupiers. We are not in Afghanistan to create a carbon copy of a Western democracy, and we are not there to convert the people to Western ways. We seek government of Afghanistan by the Afghans themselves. We insist only that it does not pose a security threat to our interests or allies. American and Britain have stood shoulder to shoulder many times in the past, in the face of tyranny and adversity—in defense of freedom. Today in Afghanistan we stand shoulder to shoulder again, alongside our many partners and alongside the Afghans themselves. The struggle against terrorism endures and is bigger than any single country or any single leader, political or military. In the long shadow of 9/11, only united will we prevail. Mr. Fox is U.K. secretary of defense. Email
