Drawn by well-paying blue-collar jobs, affordable housing and safe neighborhoods, Latinos are migrating from traditional settlement areas in the Western U.S. to the interior.

Singers practiced before the service at St. Mary of the Visitation in September. Integration into the community was helped by the fact that Latinos dispersed throughout the city rather than settled in a single neighborhood. Jenn Ackerman for The Wall Street Journal
