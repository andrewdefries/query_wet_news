By Mimosa Spencer French authorities are conducting tests on three people who came into contact with a carrier of the SARS-like novel coronavirus and showing suspicious symptoms, a regional health authority said Friday. The results of the tests are expected Friday afternoon, said Beatrice Degrugillers, a spokeswoman for a regional health authority in Northern France. In France's first confirmed case, a 65-year-old man with an acute respiratory infection Tuesday tested positive for the virus which has killed 18 out of 33 known cases world-wide in the year of its known existence. The man, who wasn't identified by French authorities, was hospitalized in April after returning from a visit to the United Arab Emirates. French officials moved to calm the public Friday. "It is not a health catastrophe; we are taking the systematic measures for the case of an illness that risks being transmittable," Sandrine Segiovia-Kueny, deputy director of the public health agency in the Nord Pas de Calais region, said on French radio station RTL Friday. The three people being tested for the virus are a female nurse, a 35-year-old doctor and a patient who was the roommate of the infected man at the hospital in the Northern French town of Douai where the man was treated, said Ms. Degrugillers. The World Health Organization has been closely monitoring the new strain that causes serious respiratory illness, with fever, cough, breathing difficulties and sometimes kidney failure and death. The virus was first discovered in humans in September, but some cases were later identified dating back to April of last year. Most cases have been found in the Middle East--in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Two cases earlier this year in the U.K. were found among family members of an infected person who had arrived from Saudi Arabia. The WHO Thursday said it has identified 33 laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus. Write to Mimosa Spencer at mimosa.spencer@dowjones.com Email

SNB Defends Euro Floor After Breach
By
Matthew Walter And Min Zeng Updated April 5, 2012 4:34 p.m. ET
NEW YORK—The Swiss National Bank spent at least €1 billion ($1.31 billion) Thursday to defend its floor for the euro against the Swiss franc after a key level was breached for the first time since the floor was established in September. Despite the Swiss Bank's action, the euro briefly dropped below CHF1.20 to trade at CHF1.1990. Policy makers established the CHF1.20 floor amid a broad rally in the franc as Europe's sovereign-debt crisis sent investors to the safety of the Swiss currency. That prompted policy makers to...

Canberra Pledges to Respond to Reports Its Spies Targeted Indonesian President's Phone

CANBERRA—Australia moved to heal a deepening rift with Indonesia, saying it would respond quickly to a letter from President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono demanding an explanation for reports that Canberra's spy agencies tapped his phone and possibly those of his top advisers. "The government will respond swiftly, fully and courteously to the president's letter," Prime Minister Tony Abbott told an unusually hushed Australian...

Kris Maher and Jack Nicas November 9, 2011
COLUMBUS, Ohio—Voters on Tuesday defeated by a wide margin a law that would have restricted the powers of unions representing teachers, police officers and other public-sector workers. WSJ's Kris Maher has details of Ohio residents voting down a proposed law that would have placed limits on unions representing teachers, police officers and other public-sector workers.
The law would have stripped the state's 350,000 public employees of most of their collective-bargaining rights and forced workers to pay at least 15% of their health-care costs. With 97% of precincts reporting, 61% of voters in a referendum voted against the Republican-backed law, known as Senate Bill 5, while 39% supported it The vote was closely watched beyond Ohio as other states have debated whether to rein in public unions to help governments cut spending on wages and benefits. Unions have faced bruising battles with newly elected Republican majorities in various states this year. In Wisconsin, lawmakers passed a law restricting union rights, but they failed to do so in Indiana. Journal Community The Ohio law was passed by the legislature and signed by Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, earlier this year. But opponents secured enough voter signatures to force a public vote before it could take effect. Ohio voters on Tuesday repealed a law that limits collective-bargaining rights of state-employees, in what could be an early sign of the political climate here ahead of the 2012 presidential elections. WSJ's Jack Nicas reports from Columbus.
"It's clear that the people have spoken," said Mr. Kasich. He said he would continue to work with local governments facing budget challenges but warned there would be "no bailout" because "there's no money." GOP House Speaker William Batchelder predicted the more palatable elements of the law, such as higher minimum contributions on health insurance and pensions, are likely to be revisited after the dust settles. Some Republicans said the party overreached in pushing through a bill before gaining broader public consensus. Despite many voters' feelings that some public workers have sweeter deals than those in the private sector, the legislation also was hurt by sympathy for "first responders" such as police officers and fire fighters. Jerry Seib on Lunch Break tells us the messages sent from voters in local and state elections across the country, including the defeat of a statewide union benefit referendum in Ohio.
Another big factor was heavy spending and strong organization by unions. The nation's biggest labor unions spent nearly $30 million to repeal the law. That was more than twice the amount spent by Republican-affiliated groups backing the law. More Ohio Voters Reject Key Part of Health Law Ohio Health Care Ballot Initiative: 2012 Preview? Anti-Abortion Measure Defeated in Mississippi Mr. Kasich crossed the state over the past week, arguing that the law would preserve jobs by helping local governments trim labor costs and avoid service cuts or tax increases. Unions countered that limiting bargaining to wages, hours and certain conditions of employment was unfair and could endanger citizens if public-safety unions could no longer bargain over such matters as how many officers ride in police cars. They opposed other changes such as a ban on strikes and making it tougher to collect dues from workers who opt out of a union. Thousands of volunteers on both sides of a public-union ballot measure made a final push to get voters to the polls Tuesday, in one of the year's biggest referendums on union benefits and bargaining rights. Jack Nicas has details on The News Hub.
Both messages resonated with voters coming out of the polls Tuesday in a middle-class neighborhood in Columbus, the state capital. "Everyone's making cutbacks…and you see government employees not really taking the cuts the average Joe American worker is taking," said John Frederick, a 30-year-old manager of a nearby industrial laundry who favored the law. But many voters sided with unions. "The idea that fire fighters and teachers are overpaid is preposterous," said Heather Reese, 25, a student at Ohio State University who voted to repeal the law. A union-backed nonprofit called We Are Ohio raised $23 million from such donors as the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees to fight the law. The National Education Association, which represents 128,000 teachers in the state, spent $10.2 million on television ads and other expenses.

Associated Press Updated May 7, 2013 6:27 a.m. ET
Three women who went missing separately about a decade ago were found in a home just south of downtown Cleveland and likely had been tied up during years of captivity, said police, who arrested three brothers. Here is the 911 call with one of the women, Amanda Berry. Photo: Reuters
CLEVELAND—Three women who went missing separately about a decade ago were found Monday in a home just south of downtown Cleveland and likely had been tied up during years of captivity, said police, who arrested three brothers. One of the women said she had been abducted and told a 911 dispatcher in a frantic call, "I'm free now." Cleveland police and federal investigators were trying to determine how three women missing for about a decade remained hidden even as authorities held vigils and followed up on a regular string of new leads. Caroline Porter reports from Cleveland on Lunch Break.
Crowds gathered Monday night on the street near the home where the city's police chief said he thought Amanda Berry,
Gina DeJesus
and Michelle Knight
had been held since they went missing when they were in their teens or early 20s. The women appeared to be in good health and were taken to a hospital to be evaluated and to reunite with relatives. Police said a 6-year-old also was found in the home, but the child's identity or relationship to anyone in the home wasn't revealed. Neighbors said they heard someone kicking at a door, yelling for help and trying desperately to get outside the house. Enlarge Image

Getty Images A neighbor, Charles Ramsey,
told WEWS-TV he saw Ms. Berry, whom he didn't recognize, at a door that would open only enough to fit a hand through. "I heard screaming," he said. "I'm eating my McDonald's. I come outside. I see this girl going nuts trying to get out of a house." Anna Tejeda,
who lives across the street, said Ms. Berry was nervous, crying and appeared dressed in pajamas and old sandals after she kicked out the screen in a door to escape and call police. On a recorded 911 call Monday, Ms. Berry said, "I'm Amanda Berry. I've been on the news for the last 10 years." She said she had been taken by someone and begged for police officers to arrive at the home on Cleveland's west side before he returned.

Ms. Berry disappeared at age 16 on April 21, 2003, when she called her sister to say she was getting a ride home from her job at a Burger King. Ms. DeJesus went missing at age 14 on her way home from school about a year later. They were found just a few miles from where they had gone missing. Police said Ms. Knight went missing in 2002 and is 32 now. They didn't provide current ages for Ms. Berry or Ms. DeJesus. Police said one of the brothers, a 52-year-old, lived at the home, and the others, ages 50 and 54, lived elsewhere. Authorities released no names and gave no details about them or what charges they might face. Mr. Ramsey, the neighbor, said he'd barbecued with the home's owner and never suspected something was amiss. "There was nothing exciting about him—well, until today," he said. Julio Castro,
who runs a grocery store half a block from where the women were found, said the homeowner arrested is his nephew, Ariel Castro.
Ms. Berry also identified Ariel Castro by name in her 911 call. Attempts to reach Ariel Castro in jail were unsuccessful Monday. Messages to the sheriff's office and a jail spokesman went unanswered, and there was no public phone listing for the home, which was being searched by dozens of police officers and sheriff's deputies. The uncle said Ariel Castro had worked as a school bus driver. The Cleveland school district confirmed he was a former employee but wouldn't release details. The women's loved ones said they hadn't given up hope of seeing them again. A childhood friend of Ms. DeJesus, Kayla Rogers,
said she couldn't wait to hug her. "I've been praying, never forgot about her, ever," Ms. Rogers told The Plain Dealer newspaper. Ms. Berry's cousin Tasheena Mitchell
told the newspaper she couldn't wait to have Ms. Berry in her arms. "I'm going to hold her, and I'm going to squeeze her and I probably won't let her go," she said. Ms. Berry's mother, Louwana Miller,
who had been hospitalized for months with pancreatitis and other ailments, died in March 2006. She had spent the previous three years looking for her daughter, whose disappearance took a toll as her health steadily deteriorated, family and friends said. Councilwoman Dona Brady
said she had spent many hours with Ms. Miller, who never gave up hope that her daughter was alive. "She literally died of a broken heart," Ms. Brady said. Mayor Frank Jackson
expressed gratitude that the three women were found alive. He said there are many unanswered questions in the continuing investigation. At Metro Health Medical Center, Dr. Gerald Maloney
wouldn't discuss the women's conditions in detail but said they were being evaluated by appropriate specialists. "This is really good, because this isn't the ending we usually hear in these stories," he said. "So, we're very happy." In January, a prison inmate was sentenced to 4 1/2 years after admitting he provided a false burial tip in the disappearance of Ms. Berry. A judge in Cleveland sentenced Robert Wolford
on his guilty plea to obstruction of justice, making a false report and making a false alarm. Last summer, Mr. Wolford tipped authorities to look for Ms. Berry's remains in a Cleveland lot. He was taken to the location, which was dug up with backhoes. Two men arrested for questioning in the disappearance of Ms. DeJesus in 2004 were released from the city jail in 2006 after officers didn't find her body during a search of the men's house. One of the men was transferred to the Cuyahoga County Jail on unrelated charges, while the other was allowed to go free, police said. Enlarge Image
Cleveland police outside a home south of downtown where they said three women, missing for about a decade, were found alive Monday.
Associated Press In September 2006, police acting on a tip tore up the concrete floor of the garage and used a cadaver dog to search unsuccessfully for Ms. DeJesus's body. Investigators confiscated 19 pieces of evidence during their search but declined to comment on the significance of the items then. No Amber Alert was issued the day Ms. DeJesus failed to return home from school in April 2004 because no one witnessed her abduction. The lack of an Amber Alert angered her father, Felix DeJesus,
who said in 2006 he believed the public will listen even if the alerts become routine. "The Amber Alert should work for any missing child," Mr. DeJesus said then. "It doesn't have to be an abduction. Whether it's an abduction or a runaway, a child needs to be found. We need to change this law." Cleveland police said then that the alerts must be reserved for cases in which danger is imminent and the public can be of help in locating the suspect and child. Email

Bad Roads, Red Tape, Burly Thugs Slow Wal-Mart's Passage in India By
Amol Sharma and Biman Mukherji Updated Jan. 12, 2013 12:01 a.m. ET
KHERI SHIKOHPUR, India—It is early afternoon and a beat-up Jeep is rumbling along a dirt lane in this north Indian hamlet, past a mound of burning trash. Suddenly the driver, with 60 burlap sacks stuffed inside and piled on the roof, approaches what looks like a sure dead end: a muddy riverbed. But there is no hesitation here. With passengers riding on the hood and rear bumper, he plows on, nearly tipping over as his wheels spin out...

Yum's Yuck Factor in China
By
Spencer Jakab
Feb. 3, 2013 12:44 p.m. ET
You won't find "45-day chicken" in any cookbook, but it has become a potential recipe for disaster at Yum Brands Inc. The term for preternaturally fast-growing birds allegedly pumped full of dangerous hormones, all over China's media and blogosphere in December, threatens the fast-food giant's critical business in that country. An exposé in local media may have dented same-store sales there by 6% during the final quarter...

Funding Theater With Imagination

More than ever, theatergoers in New York are blessed with an embarrassment of riches: experimental work, which has been long marginalized, is awakening traditional stages; nonprofit theaters are investing millions in affordable ticket-pricing and intimate state-of-the-art venues; non-traditional ensembles are dazzling their way into the mainstream. Many theater makers, on the other hand, are struggling like almost never before, with...

The Treasury Department said Wednesday the government would hit its legal borrowing limit by Monday, setting in motion emergency measures to keep the government operating for several more weeks and serving as a reminder that the nation's budget wrangling could continue well into 2013. Enlarge Image
Senate leaders will return Thursday, while the House won't be in session before the weekend. Above, Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.) last week.
Reuters The Treasury Department says the U.S. is on track to hit the debt ceiling by Monday, setting in motion steps that might buy the government time before it faces a debt crisis. WSJ's Damien Paletta has the latest. Photo: AP.
The Treasury's financial maneuvering is designed to put off until February or March the prospect of a full-blown debt crisis. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's
two-paragraph letter to Congress didn't specify when the emergency measures might be exhausted, blaming the "significant uncertainty that now exists with regard to unresolved tax and spending policies for 2013." More Geithner's Letter to Congress The White House and congressional leaders have shown no signs of progress toward crafting an agreement to avoid the year-end tax increases and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff. President Barack Obama
and Senate leaders will return to work Thursday, and they are running out of time to broker a deal before tax increases hit almost every working American. A narrow deal to avert that outcome—a plausible result—might not include an agreement to raise the $16.394 trillion debt ceiling, as Democrats have pressed, meaning the big, unresolved questions over how the federal government should raise and spend money are likely to come to the fore as the debt deadline draws near. The Geithner letter underscored how much the fiscal-cliff deliberations have frozen in place regular governmental activity. Mr. Geithner also said it wasn't possible to know whether the 2012 tax-filing season would be delayed. Make Your Own Deficit-Reduction Plan Try your hand at balancing the budget and share the results. Falling Over the Fiscal Cliff See some scenarios for how different groups of people may be affected by the tax changes that will take place if the fiscal cliff isn't resolved by the Jan. 1., 2013, deadline.

More photos and interactive graphics When Mr. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner
(R., Ohio) discussed a broad deficit-reduction agreement as recently as this month, the White House hoped to include a debt-limit increase that would put the issue to rest for two years or more. Mr. Boehner, in his final offer before talks collapsed, showed willingness to raise the debt limit for a year if Mr. Obama agreed to significant cuts in entitlement programs. Political leaders are looking to advance a smaller package that focuses on blocking tax increases for most Americans and postponing or replacing scheduled spending cuts. A senior Democratic aide said the prospect of including a debt-ceiling increase was "too much of a lift to pass either chamber" of Congress. The aide said he was "pessimistic" about the prospects of getting any bill through the Senate before Tuesday, which is Jan. 1, unless Messrs. Boehner and Obama strike a last-minute deal. Mr. Boehner sent the House home on recess and said he would call members back with 48 hours notice if there was a deal to approve. Mr. Boehner held a conference call with his leadership team Wednesday and decided not to call lawmakers back, according to a senior House GOP aide. That means the House won't be in session before this weekend. Mr. Boehner will hold another conference call Thursday open to all House Republicans. The Senate is scheduled to reconvene Thursday, with no measures related to the fiscal cliff scheduled. Mr. Obama cut short his vacation in Hawaii to return to Washington on Thursday to help work on a deal. The White House's goal is to determine what kind of deal might be acceptable to Senate Republicans. The U.S. government has a hard limit on the amount of debt it can accumulate, and only Congress can raise it, which for years was a routine procedure. Without an increase, the U.S. would eventually default on its debt obligations, potentially sparking a financial crisis. In 2011, the last time the Obama administration notified Congress about nearing the debt ceiling, Republicans said they wouldn't raise the limit unless the White House agreed to major spending cuts. That standoff led to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which included the spending cuts set to take effect next week. It also ultimately led Standard & Poor's Ratings Services to strip the U.S. government of its top-notch credit rating. Moody's Investors Service, another ratings firm, said Wednesday that reaching the borrowing limit wouldn't change its top rating on the U.S., but it said the firm would downgrade the U.S. "if there is no solution in 2013 that produces a clear picture of the medium-term fiscal outlook and the medium-term debt trajectory." Mr. Obama has said he wouldn't negotiate with Congress again over raising the debt ceiling, saying it is lawmakers' responsibility to authorize payments for debts the country has already accumulated. Treasury has known for months that the debt ceiling could be reached in December, which analysts have said would mean the emergency measures would keep the government operating until about late February. —Carol E.

Rockefeller's Senate Exit Lifts GOP Hopefuls
West Virginia Lawmaker, Who Balanced Coal-Industry Interests and Climate-Change Advocacy, to End His Five-Term Run
By
Corey Boles
Updated Jan. 11, 2013 6:56 p.m. ET
WASHINGTON—Sen. Jay Rockefeller's decision not to seek a sixth Senate term in 2014 will open up a West Virginia Senate seat long held by Democrats but no longer a safe bet for the party. Mr. Rockefeller, first elected to his seat in 1984, announced Friday that he wouldn't run again. West Virginia has been leaning more conservative in recent years, though Democrats currently hold both Senate seats and the governor's mansion....

President Barack Obama,
who campaigned amid tensions with Israel and a testy relationship with its prime minister, saw his vote among American Jews decline in his successful bid for re-election. Mr. Obama, like previous Democratic presidential candidates, still won a majority of the Jewish vote, which made up 2% of the total turnout this year. But he took 69% of that vote this year, down from 78% in 2008. The president may not be the only one paying a price for the chilly relations between him and Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Netanyahu, who before the election was widely seen in his country to be favoring Republican Mitt Romney,
faces a backlash at home for having potentially antagonized the winner. For Jewish Republicans who campaigned against Mr. Obama as too weak in his support of Israel, the results were mixed. They take some credit for an improved Republican performance by Mitt Romney among Jews, but say it won't be enough to win the White House unless the GOP can find a way to appeal to larger minority groups. "If Republicans had done in the Hispanic community, or the black community, or the young community, what they were able to do in the Jewish community, Gov. Romney would have won" nationally, said Ari Fleischer, an adviser to the Republican Jewish Coalition. Still, he found the results encouraging. "This is all about inroads," he said. Whether Republicans can improve their performance with Jews in 2016 is dependent almost entirely on who the candidates are, he said. Despite the drop in support, Mr. Obama won every state where a substantial Jewish population is considered especially influential. That apparently includes Florida, which is continuing to count votes, but which Mr. Romney's Florida campaign said Thursday he is likely to lose. Jewish Democratic leaders said that the results reflected the president's overall tougher road this year. David A. Harris, president of the National Jewish Democratic Council, pointed to a study released this summer that did a deeper analysis of 2008 exit polls and concluded Mr. Obama likely took 74% of their votes, not the 78% exit polls showed. In that case, Mr. Harris said, a drop of five percentage points among Jews is close to his overall drop among white voters. "American Jews are, first and foremost, Americans. Like other white Americans, they're moved by the economy and other factors," he said. He said the Republican "smear efforts" made no difference. "It changed nothing," he said. In Israel, Mr. Netanyahu was doing some damage control. The day after the election, Mr. Netanyahu summoned Dan Shapiro, U.S. ambassador to Israel, to his office so he could offer congratulations to Mr. Obama. The Israeli government videotaped what appeared to some observers as an awkward exchange and posted it online. "I think the United States of American again demonstrated why it's the greatest democracy on earth," the Israeli leader said. The White House said Mr. Obama spoke with Mr. Netanyahu, among other world leaders, Thursday morning, returning a call of congratulations. On Wednesday, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert questioned Mr. Netanyahu's approach to the election, where Mr. Netanyahu was widely seen to be criticizing Mr. Obama for not being tough enough on Iran and its nuclear threat. For instance, in September, Mr. Netanyahu said, "The fact is that every day that passes, Iran gets closer and closer to a nuclear bomb. The world tells Israel wait, there's still time. And I say wait for what? Wait until when?"
