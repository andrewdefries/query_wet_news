Chasing Deadbeat Argentina
A U.S. investor tries to get its money back from Buenos Aires. Updated Oct. 16, 2012 12:01 a.m. ET
A naval schooner and its crew docks in a West African port and is seized by local authorities. No, this isn't the beginning of a Joseph Conrad novella but a 21st-century tale of global finance and international law. The ship is Argentina's ARA Libertad, and the dispute that prompted its detention in Ghana spans four continents and dates to the collapse of Argentina's currency peg in 2001. Buenos Aires wound up defaulting on $95...

A School Fix Without a Fight Cleveland Mayor Works With Governor and Teachers to Link Pay to Test Scores
By
Stephanie Banchero
Updated July 10, 2012 10:09 a.m. ET
The Republican governor of Ohio, the Democratic mayor of Cleveland and the local teachers union have united to overhaul how teachers are hired, fired and paid, a rare example of cooperation in education that some critics warn could still face challenges in the implementation. The overhaul, signed into law by Gov. John Kasich this month, will allow the district to link teachers' pay, in part, to student test scores, and to lay off...

U.S. stocks tumbled for the seventh time in eight trading sessions, capping a day on which investors around the globe sold shares as they braced for the U.S. government to partially shut down for the first time in 17 years. Many investors fretted that budgetary uncertainty and the prospect that the U.S. could run out of borrowing capacity in October will add to market headwinds amid soft global economic growth, slowing corporate profit gains and a pickup in interest rates. Also unsettling investors is political instability in Italy, where the government is teetering on the brink of collapse. Milan's FTSE MIB stock index was down 1.2%, while 10-year Italian government bond yields reached a three-month high above 4.7%. In the Markets Monthly Global Stock Indexes VIX 'Fear Gauge' Rises Heard: Shutting Down Emerging Markets Dollar Falls on Shutdown Worry Global Political Battles Hit Stocks Tape: Time for Profits to Catch Up to Stock Prices Government Heads Toward Shutdown Morning MoneyBeat: Dark Clouds Glower Over Washington On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 128.57 points, or 0.8%, to 15129.67. The S&P 500-stock index shed 10.20 points, or 0.6%, to 1681.55, with all 10 sectors lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 10.12 points, or 0.3%, to 3771.48. Even with Monday's losses, stocks performed strongly in the quarter and year. The Dow is up 15.5% for the year, after a 1.5% advance in the third quarter. The S&P 500 rose 3% for September and 4.7% in the third quarter. "Despite the naysayers, it looks like September is turning out to be a positive month," said Alan Gayle,
who oversees about $325 million as senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments. "But the uncertainty surrounding the [budget] and debt ceiling makes investors nervous." Stocks sold off sharply at the market's open as worries spread about budget negotiations. At its session low, the Dow had shed 172 points. Traders said that market action indicated little panic. Small stocks lost less than their larger peers, another sign that investors weren't rushing for the exits. The Russell 2000 Index, a benchmark for small-capitalization stocks, was down less than 0.1% for the day. The battles in Congress have been weighing on markets for over a week. The S&P 500 has lost 2.5% since closing at an all-time high of 1725.52 on Sept. 18. Investors also may have to contend with some key economic data points this week. A measure of manufacturing activity is scheduled for Tuesday, a service-sector business activity reading will come Thursday, and then Friday may bring the closely watched government employment report for September, if the government is operating normally. The labor market is a main driver of Federal Reserve policy decisions, so the strength of Friday's report could help determine when the central bank starts to pare its stimulus efforts. "In a normal week, every one of these releases would take center stage," said Joseph Tanious,
global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. "Unfortunately, Washington's theatrics are overshadowing the data." "In a normal week, every one of these releases would take center stage," said Joseph Tanious, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. "Unfortunately, Washington's theatrics are overshadowing the data." The yield on 10-year Treasury notes pulled back slightly, to 2.614% from 2.620%, where it settled Friday. Yields move inversely to prices. Crude-oil futures fell 0.5% to settle at $102.33 a barrel. Gold futures eased 0.9% to $1,326.50 a troy ounce. The dollar slipped against the yen and edged up against the euro. Asian markets also were mostly lower, led by a 2.1% slide in Japan's Nikkei Stock Average on the back of U.S. worries and a strengthening yen. In corporate news, J.C. Penney Co.

Japanese stocks tumbled on Monday as a strengthening yen led to another day of volatile trading in Tokyo. The dollar slipped below ¥101 to fetch ¥100.92 at the close of equity trading in Tokyo, from ¥101.67 at the same time Friday. Later in the global day, the greenback was at ¥101.12, down from ¥101.31 late Friday in New York. The effect of a stronger local currency helped pull the Nikkei Stock Average down 3.2% to 14142.65. The benchmark was already coming off two of its most volatile trading sessions in more than 20 years, moving more than 1,000 points on both Thursday and Friday. Although the market closed higher on Friday, it spent the day swinging between positive and negative territory. With Monday's decline, the index is down 9.5% over three sessions. "The dollar's continued retracement, along with technicals, point to upside resistance for Japanese shares for the time being," says Hiroshi Nishi,
general manager of equities at SMBC Nikko Securities. The recent firmness in the yen ends a long stretch of U.S. dollar strength that saw the currency climb against its Japanese counterpart for three consecutive weeks. However, over the last five sessions the dollar fell 1.9% against the yen, its worst weekly performance in nearly a year. The market was weighed by falls in large index constituents—such as SoftBank Corp.

senior strategist, Daiwa Capital Markets. "If the government can't explain how Japan is going to achieve growth and organize its finances, Japan may face criticism against its aggressive monetary easing."

On Wine: Lettie Teague
The Actual Facts Behind the Rise of Natural Wine
"Natural" is a small but growing category in wine, signaling biodynamic, organic or vegan winemaking practices. But Lettie Teague wonders: Is the movement about taste or just ideology?

WILLIAM JAMES was not only a famous philosopher but a source of some pretty memorable quotes. One of his better-known observations, "Belief creates the actual fact," came to mind recently as I was researching the topic of natural wine. When I asked wine professionals to define the term, each gave a different reply. Natural wine, it would seem, has a lot more to do with individual belief than it does with incontrovertible fact.

Marc Rosenthal for The Wall Street Journal Although the number of natural wines in the world is relatively small, the topic has loomed large in recent years. It may be one of the most controversial in the wine world, with strong feelings expressed by partisans of both the "natural" and the not. Natural-wine proponents describe their wines as "pure" and "kind to the planet" and other wines as "industrial" or worse, while non-naturalists have likened their natural counterparts to cult members. The term "natural wine" is fairly new, at least in terms of general parlance. According to Alice Feiring,
a natural-wine authority, one of its champions was famed Beaujolais producer Marcel Lapierre, who, along with his compatriots, began using the term about 10 years ago after adopting the teachings of the late French chemist/winemaker Jules Chauvet.
Oenofile: Natural Wines That Offer Enjoyment, Not Just Ideology

F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal Ms. Feiring, who writes both a natural-wine newsletter and blog, offered this definition via email: "It needs to be natural from the ground up. Nothing added, nothing taken away. No additives, no adjustments and very little added sulfur." That sounded all well and good. But would a vintner agree? I called Jared Brandt,
a well-regarded natural winemaker and proprietor of Donkey & Goat Winery in Berkeley, Calif., and asked for his definition. "Natural wine is open to interpretation," said Mr. Brandt. "People have their own concepts of what it means." (Mr. Brandt, and his wife, Tracey, offer their full thoughts on the subject on the "Manifesto" page of their website, donkeyandgoat.com.) Mr. Brandt said that he thinks the one thing that "people can seem to agree on" is that natural wines cannot be made with commercial yeast. Winemakers use different types of yeasts—some are "wild," i.e., occurring naturally, while others are cultured for the specific qualities they impart. Stu Smith
of Smith-Madrone Winery in the Napa Valley isn't a natural grower by naturalist standards (which he rejects), though he, too, makes well-regarded wines. Mr. Smith called Mr. Brandt's wild-yeast definition "complete hooey," saying, "Can you smell and taste a wine and actually say, 'This one is made with wild yeast and this one is made with commercial yeast'?" I called Mr. Brandt to see what he thought of Mr. Smith's assessment. He replied via email, "I would be happy to taste with him and compare—I bet he and I could tell the difference more often than not." “
I don't care What the Winemaker Believes the Most—just give me good wine.
”
Mr. Smith has been growing and making wine for over 40 years (including some made with wild yeast) and said he was sympathetic to the natural-wine movement, which he called an "emotional reaction to an ever-changing world," but he said he was troubled that it relied more on belief than science. And then, of course, there was its marketing side. "There are so many wineries in the world looking for publicity; a natural wine is a point of difference," said Mr. Smith. Michael Andrews
of the Natural Wine Co. in Brooklyn, N.Y., also found natural wine hard to define. But surely he had some criteria? After all, he was selling the stuff. "At minimum, a natural wine should be made from organically grown grapes," said Mr. Andrews. (Over at the Wine Hut in Manhattan, a clerk told me that "only biodynamic, not [merely] organic, wines" could be natural when I asked about an organic rosé.) Mr. Andrews, who said his store wasn't really based on an ideology, groups natural wines into four categories—biodynamic, organic, vegan and no-added-sulfites—and offered a brief description of each (which I've shortened further). The first two are straightforward: Biodynamic wines are made according to the farming principles of Austrian theosophist Rudolf Steiner,
while organic wines are made without the use of chemicals and pesticides. Vegan wines are made without animal products—such as the egg whites used for fining, the process of clarifying wine with an added agent—but Mr. Andrews noted that "a lot of industrial [nonnatural] wines could actually be labeled vegan wines since they don't use eggs for fining." The no-added-sulfites wines are "the most natural wines you'll find," Mr. Andrews posited on his website, though he also calls their makers "brave souls," as wines without added sulfites are also the least stable. Sulfur dioxide is antimicrobial, killing off harmful bacteria, and it acts as a preservative, keeping a wine from becoming oxidized. Wines made with little or no added sulfur dioxide tend to be fragile and can easily lose their color and flavor during the stress of shipping. (That's why Mr. Brandt said he adds sulfur dioxide to almost all of his wines.) Natural wines are also at risk for higher levels of biogenic amines, according to Charles Massoud
of Paumanok Vineyards in Aquebogue, N.Y., who has researched the topic. (Biogenic amines include tyramine and putrescine, which can cause severe side effects in large doses.) Mr. Massoud isn't a natural-wine producer—and he said he resents that natural winemakers define the terms. "Natural as opposed to what?" he said. When it came time to buy natural wines for my tasting, I turned to Mr. Andrews as well as Andrew Chen
of New York's Flatiron Wines & Spirits, another retailer specializing in natural wines. I asked them to suggest some of their favorites, whether biodynamic, organic or vegan. (I bought a few from other shops, too, but found none without sulfites.) I purchased 15 wines altogether, ranging from $15 to $40 a bottle, from France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the U.S. The results were decidedly mixed: While I was pleased by almost all of the whites, sparkling wines and rosés, I was much less happy with most of the reds. The light-colored wines were generally bright and expressive (none was oxidative in the least). They included a stony German Riesling (
Clemens Busch
), a peachy Riesling from Alsace (Domaine Ostertag), a pretty Provençal rosé (La Croix du Prieur) and a terrific Sancerre made by Gérard Boulay. The red wines were another story. Although a couple showed fresh fruit and bright acidity (Gueule de Loup, a red blend from Provence; a Tuscan Syrah from Stefano Amerighi), several were quite light and tart, and others tasted, quite frankly, like beet juice. Most of the reds were fairly low in alcohol (around 12%), which would have been fine except that they were also low in everything else—namely flavor and intensity. Maybe something should have been added or taken away? My tasting didn't lead me to any profound conclusions, although it did lead me to believe that some natural winemakers are more talented than others. What bothers me most about natural wine, beyond the off-putting categorization and the (unproven) specter of biogenic amines, is the ideology that its true believers espouse. I want a wine that simply tastes good; I don't need to know What the Winemaker Believes Most. I wouldn't buy a wine just because it's purportedly natural any more than I would shun one because it's not. After all, as William James
also said, "The art of being wise is knowing what to overlook." See wine videos and more from Off Duty at youtube.com/wsj.com. Email Lettie at wine@wsj.com. Email
