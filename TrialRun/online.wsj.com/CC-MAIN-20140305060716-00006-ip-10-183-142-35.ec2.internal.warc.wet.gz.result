Biography
Nov. 25, 2013 6:47 p.m. ET
To adapt Churchill: Never in the field of global diplomacy has so much been given away by so many for so little. Britain and France's capitulation to Nazi Germany at Munich has long been a byword for ignominy, moral and diplomatic. Yet neither Neville Chamberlain nor Édouard Daladier had the public support or military wherewithal to stand up to Hitler in September 1938. Britain had just 384,000 men in its regular army; the first...

Veronica Dagher
Updated May 7, 2012 9:49 a.m. ET
Heaven help us. Jim Bakker, the disgraced 1980s televangelist whose "PTL Club" television empire was laid asunder by dual sex and money scandals, is out of prison and renouncing the prosperity gospel he once preached. There are scammers even in church. Veronica Dagher discusses how you can make sure your church donation goes to the right place. Photo: Getty Images.
But churches, unfortunately, still provide fertile ground for scammers and con artists—from the secretary in the U.K. who was reported to have embezzled church funds to pay for a stamp collection, to a bankrupt Southern Baptist-affiliated foundation in Arizona that bilked elderly investors out of millions of dollars. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges accusing a businessman of targeting church congregations in a giant Ponzi scheme. Enlarge Image
Bob Daly Of the $569 billion that churchgoers and others are expected to donate to Christian causes this year world-wide, about 6%, $35 billion, will end up in the hands of money launderers, embezzlers, tax evaders or unscrupulous ministers living too high on the hog, according to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in South Hamilton, Mass. So how can you make sure your donation goes to the right place and what else should you consider before giving to your church or other house of worship? Be a Doubting Thomas One of William Riley's clients recently called the Fort Worth, Texas, financial adviser wondering if she should donate to a new church in her community. She was already a regular contributor to her own church and she was solicited from her church directory to provide financial help with the new organization. The client took Mr. Riley's advice and let him contact the person requesting the gift. When Mr. Riley started asking about the church's mission and how it planned to use the funds, the solicitor ended the phone call. "We never heard from him again," says Mr. Riley. Whether it's a new or established church, donors have a right to ask how their donation will be used. But churches, unlike many other nonprofit organizations, aren't required to file 501(c)(3) tax forms, which make it easy for donors to look up information outlining finances and management. So it's important for donors to ask questions and request to see the church's audited financial statements, says Laura Fredricks, a New York fundraising consultant. While it probably won't be appropriate for donors to walk up to the head of their church and "demand to know where the money is going," there are other places they can turn, says Randy Wolverton, a retired FBI agent and forensic accountant in Kansas City, Mo. Members may want to start with their church's finance committee and ask to see the church's financial reports or attend a finance-committee meeting. They also could ask about the church's procedures for collecting, depositing and accounting for the money. "One person shouldn't have complete control of the money," says Mr. Wolverton. Churches should have professional accounting systems to help ensure donations are properly received and disbursed. Organizations lacking such safeguards are more vulnerable to abuse, he says. Defensive or evasive behavior and an unwillingness to answer questions on the part of the minister or whoever is in charge of the church's finances may indicate funds aren't being used as the donor intended, says Victoria Collins, a certified financial planner in Corona Del Mar, Calif. She also recommends that donors see if their own pastors and other ministers donate to the church. "Leaders should take their own giving seriously," she says. "Shun manipulation and run if you hear 'God told me how to spend your money and don't ask questions,' " says Calvin Edwards, an Atlanta-based philanthropic adviser. Provide for Family When one of Steve Blankenship's clients wanted to increase a tithe, the Grapevine, Texas, certified financial planner suggested waiting. While the couple were very committed to their church, they were also putting themselves in financial jeopardy by racking up debt by tithing on a credit card they weren't able to pay in full every month, he says. So Mr. Blankenship complimented the couple on their generosity and turned to the Bible for counsel. "I argued that the debtor is a slave to the lender, which the Bible clearly calls into question," says Mr. Blankenship, referencing Proverbs (22:7). Beware of easy giving. Mr. Blankenship says electronic giving, whether it be automatically charging pledges to a credit card or texting a donation, can make it easier for donors to keep up with pledges. But they should be mindful of their overall financial situation so they don't put themselves in debt. Whatever the amount donors decide to give, advisers say setting a budget for their giving can help the donor and the church. Financial adviser Clarissa Hobson in Colorado Springs, Colo., sits down annually with some clients to help them determine how much they'd like to pledge to their church. That amount is a personal decision and varies by donor, she says, but determining the number early in the year can help the client plan their cash flow more accurately. A budget also can help donors feel confident to agree to or turn down additional requests for money from their church that may arise throughout the year, she says. Do Good Flexibility in a charitable-giving budget is also important, says Ms. Hobson. That helped one of the couples she works with who had committed to giving each year but had to reduce their tithe when the breadwinner husband lost his job. While the couple had to reduce their financial contribution in the short term, they planned to increase their giving again when he found a job. In the meantime, the couple decided to volunteer more at the church. "A direct donation isn't always the best option," says Helen Huntley, a St. Petersburg, Fla., certified financial planner. Ms. Huntley frequently recommends clients donate appreciated securities to their church, especially when they have a very low cost basis, as it's often more tax advantageous than giving cash. In addition, donors may want to consider giving to their church through a donor-advised fund such as the National Christian Foundation or Fidelity Charitable, says Mike Walters, chief executive of Portformulas Investing, based in Ada, Mich. And for donors who want to continue or even begin their legacy of giving from beyond the grave, it may make sense to name their church as the beneficiary of their individual retirement account or include their church in their estate plan, says Heidi Schmidt, a wealth manager at USAA in Dallas. "You can give to your church and potentially reduce your estate taxes," she says. Write to Veronica Dagher at veronica.dagher@dowjones.com Email

VIÑA DEL MAR, Chile—Rafael Nadal, the world's former No. 1 tennis player, once had some harsh words for the extent to which anti-doping officials would chase after players for testing, saying they made him feel like a criminal. Enlarge Image
Rafael Nadal on Saturday
European Pressphoto Agency But after the Lance Armstrong
scandal, he's changed his tune. Nadal, in Chile to play his first tournament since his second-round loss at last year's Wimbledon, now says tennis players should be tested as often and as openly as possible to avoid the kind of doping scandals that are plaguing cycling and baseball. "If we have to go through a test every week, I don't see a problem with that if it's useful to fight what happened in other sports," Nadal said at a press conference Saturday ahead of the VTR Open, which starts Monday. "I hope tennis can continue being a clean sport as it has been for almost all of its history." The Spanish player, who has fallen to No. 5, plans to resume his career at a tournament in the coastal city of Viña del Mar, Chile, after seven months out due to a knee injury and then a stomach virus. Like all major tennis players, Nadal, who has won 11 Grand Slams, is tested wherever he travels with no warning. In 2009, he said he felt like "a criminal" for having to inform the World Anti-Doping Agency permanently about his whereabouts. (All top tennis pros must submit to these conditions.) Virtually every professional sport is coming under greater scrutiny for the use of banned substances. After years of denying doping, Armstrong admitted last month that he had used illicit drugs to help him win seven Tour de France titles. He has been stripped of the titles. Baseball is reeling from its latest doping scandal, too. A report in the Miami New Times newspaper alleges that New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez and several other high-profile players were the clients of an anti-aging clinic in South Florida that gave the players performance-enhancing drugs. Rodriguez's public relations firm has denied the allegations. He has not commented directly. Other players involved have also issued denials. Unlike cycling, tennis has been free of doping scandals in recent years. But the International Tennis Federation and the WADA are trying to increase testing, according to statements made by Francesco Ricci Bitti, the president of the International Tennis Federation and a member of the executive committee of the WADA, in November to the German press agency DPA.

Sycamore Networks: From $45 Billion to Zilch
By
Scott Thurm and Ben Fox Rubin Updated Feb. 1, 2013 5:38 p.m. ET
There was a time when Sycamore Networks Inc. was the next big thing—a leader in the race to direct digital traffic across the Internet. This is not that time. On Friday, Sycamore all but went out of business. The Chelmsford, Mass., company said it had completed the sale of its remaining product line and that its shareholders had voted to dissolve the company. Sycamore ended the day with a market value of about $66 million, a humbling...

WASHINGTON—The Senate early Saturday passed its first formal budget in four years, defining Democrats' fiscal principles for the next, uncertain stage of Washington's battle over debt, spending and taxes. Enlarge Image
The setting sun is reflected in the windows of the U.S. Capitol, on Capitol Hill, Friday.
Alex Brandon/Associated Press More on the Senate Budget Budget Targets Fannie, Freddie Fees Seib & Wessel: Fiscal Drama The Democratic-drafted budget, approved narrowly a couple hours before dawn, calls for almost $1 trillion in new taxes over the next decade to help reduce the deficit. Although the budget is nonbinding and isn't likely to become law, it fleshes out Democrats' vision of a plan to reduce the deficit while protecting safety-net programs. The Senate passed the budget 50-49, largely along party lines. "The solution to our fiscal challenges will not be found in deep cuts to programs that vulnerable families depend on," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D., Wash.) as she closed debate on the blueprint. Republicans said the plan did too little to reduce the deficit, especially compared with House Republicans' plan to balance the budget in 10 years. "Honest people can disagree on policy, but there can be no disagreement on the need to change our debt course," said Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee. "The House budget changes our debt course, while the Senate budget does not." The Senate approved the budget after voting on a slew of amendments stretched through the night. Among them, the Senate Friday adopted an amendment aimed at giving states more authority to collect sales taxes from out-of-state Internet retailers. The budget plan was opposed by four Democrats who are up for re-election in 2014: Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), Kay Hagan (D., N.C.), Mark Pryor (D., Ark.) and Mark Begich (D., Alaska). All of the Senate's Republicans voted against the plan and Sen. Frank Lautenberg
(D., N.J.) didn't vote. Congress will be out of town for a two-week spring recess after three months of budget wrangling in which Congress passed a major tax increase, raised the federal debt limit, allowed $85 billion in spending cuts to take effect and enacted a bill to keep the government operating through Sept. 30. But the end of that flurry of activity is just the beginning of the next, more amorphous phase of budgeting. It isn't clear whether or how Democrats can bridge the vast differences between their Senate budget and the version passed by the Republican-controlled House Thursday. The GOP budget enshrines conservative fiscal principles that are anathema to Democrats, raising no taxes and making substantial cuts in Medicare and other safety-net programs. It is unlikely that the differences will be resolved in textbook legislative fashion—through a House-Senate conference committee to negotiate a compromise. Instead, lawmakers predict any big budget deal would emerge from high-level negotiations with the White House. President Barack Obama
has tried to reach out to Republicans who might be willing to work with him on a deficit-reduction deal that includes both tax increases and spending cuts. So far, nothing concrete has come of those efforts. But members of both parties said that passage of the two budgets was a precondition to further progress, allowing both parties to speak to their political base before talking further with each other. "No budget is going to be perfect for everyone, but this is a credible, important first step in the process," said Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.), a Senate Budget Committee member who has supported deeper spending cuts in bipartisan deals. "I look forward to moving to the next stage." The next pressure point comes this spring and summer, when Congress will have to raise the federal debt limit or else let the U.S. Treasury run out of cash to pay its bills. House Republicans say they won't approve any debt increase unless it is paired with matching budget cuts. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) has said his party's lawmakers will meet immediately after Congress returns in April to begin discussing what their price will be for raising the debt limit. However, Mr. Obama has said he won't negotiate over that must-pass measure, and Republicans have been gun-shy about reviving their past strategy of threatening to delay a debt-limit increase to get their way. Whenever or however a deal takes shape, the big questions are whether Mr. Obama is able to offer cuts in Medicare and other entitlement programs that are drastic enough to open the way for Republicans to compromise on taxes. And if so, whether there are enough Republicans open to including tax increases to build a majority without GOP leaders who are adamantly opposed. The budget debate in the Senate laid bare the deep partisan divisions over numerous issues. Many amendments were rejected along strict party lines and were of little consequence because the entire budget is a nonbinding measure and destined not to become law. Buried in the partisan onslaught, however, are two important tax proposals that came to test votes in the Senate for the first time. The first, passed Thursday, called for repealing a tax on medical devices that is part of Mr. Obama's health-care law; it passed by a wide bipartisan margin with support from many Democrats whose states are home to big device manufacturers. The Senate approved an amendment that called for making it easier for states to collect sales tax from online retail sales. The measure opened divisions within both parties: Senators representing states that have sales taxes supported the amendment, while those from states that don't allied with online retailers in opposition to it.

Hollywood Enjoys a Robust Holiday By
Erica Orden
Updated Nov. 25, 2012 8:12 p.m. ET
Teen vampires again took the top spot at the box office, beating out new, family-friendly competition from a gang of childhood heroes, as well as from the highly anticipated adaptation of the novel "Life of Pi." Overall, the holiday weekend extended what has been a relatively robust run for Hollywood, with the five-day box-office tally coming in at $290 million, the highest Thanksgiving Day weekend totals to date.

Updated Nov. 2, 2012 12:01 a.m. ET
New York At the heart of the Japan Society's "Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hōitsu (1761-1828)" and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's "Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art" are paintings striking for their rich use of color and stark compositions—cranes silhouetted against gold, flat planes of color forming trees and fruit, a naturalistic moth hovering over a cluster of irises. But there are also group scenes of poets in animated conversation as well as hyperrealistic depictions of, say, tree trunks with lichen or poppies in bloom floating in abstracted settings. Dated from the 16th century onward, all are presented as belonging to the Rinpa (or Rimpa) school. Just as there is disagreement on transliteration, so is there equivocation on exactly what the word denotes. Indeed, it's never a good sign when a definition begins with a negative, and writings about Rinpa/Rimpa uniformly start off by stating that it is "not a school" with a traditional master-student lineage. Rather, it is an affiliation of artists across time and space, artists who "tend to" depict nature and draw on classic Japanese tales and poetry, "often" simplify compositions and deploy a wet-on-wet brush technique known as tarashikomi. As the Japan Society demonstrates, the best way to grasp the big picture is by diving first into the particular. Curated by Matthew P. McKelway of Columbia University, its show focuses primarily on Sakai Hōitsu, the scion of a high-ranking family in the capital, Edo, who began painting courtesans in the manner of prominent ukiyo-e—floating world—artists. When drastic reforms aimed in part at separating the classes took effect, Hōitsu wisely turned his attention to safe themes drawn from courtly Japanese painting and became enamored of earlier works, particularly by Ogata Kōrin (1658-1716) and Tawaraya Sōtatsu (for whom the only known date is his death in 1640). Rinpa, a term coined in the Meiji period (1868-1912), combines the second syllable of Kōrin and pa, meaning school. Most revealing is the juxtaposition of Hōitsu's "Waves" (c. 1815) and Kōrin's "Rough Waves" (c. 1705). (Note that these two works are on view only until Nov. 4, when the former returns to Tokyo's Seikadō Bunko Art Museum and the latter to the Met.) In both, a large wave rushes in from the upper right while another ripples up from the lower left. Kōrin's composition, however, fills a two-panel folding screen, while Hōitsu's spills across two six-panel screens. Kōrin's waves rise from a blue ocean to crest against a gold background; Hōitsu's are in black ink on a silver ground, and the artist echoes the general shape of Kōrin's top wave in his own lower one. The treatment of the metallic background also differs. In Kōrin's screen, the squares of gold leaf are applied unevenly, creating a fluid backdrop, while Hōitsu had his squares of silver leaf applied regularly to form a faint grid behind his swirling, tentacled waves. He probably also treated some leaves to retard their tarnishing, thereby creating a modulation reminiscent of a cloudy sky. Was Hōitsu simply trying to best his hero? The answer lies in poetry. Hōitsu wrote haikai, a form of lighthearted collaborative poetry in which each poet links his verse to the previous one's. But as Haruo Shirane, author of "Japan and the Culture of the Four Seasons: Nature, Literature, & the Arts" (Columbia University Press, 2012), noted during a symposium that accompanied the exhibition, each poet strives also to tweak the meaning of his predecessor's verse. "Giving it a twist is very important," Mr. Shirane said, suggesting that this "haikai spirit" might also be at work in Hōitsu's paintings. It is a shame that neither the catalog nor wall text highlighted this particular aspect of haikai, for it unlocks the creative dynamics at play through this and the Met's show. "Waves" contains familiar Kōrin elements, but with a twist—in this case reversals—that reconfigure the composition to form something entirely new. A commitment to this haikai spirit helps explain why Hōitsu disseminated Kōrin's and others' work in reproduction through printed books (some samples are in the show). And it lends depth to such works as Hōitsu's series "Birds and Flowers of the Twelve Months" (c. 1824-28) that pick up on a classical theme but alter the coupling of flora and fauna and make lavish use of the wet-on-wet tarashikomi brushstroke. Quickly, before the ink or watercolor dried, Hōitsu added a second "brushload" that diffused and spread inside the first pool, creating a smooth mottling. Sōtatsu had developed this technique, and it is well worth heading to the Met's show to see wonderful examples of his work. Nor is this the only reason. John T. Carpenter, Met curator for Japanese art, offers up examples of recognizable haikai interplay even though the selection sometimes feels a tad too broad, running the risk of diluting Rinpa into little more than a highly decorative aesthetic. Still, the shows inform one another beautifully. The final gallery of the Hōitsu show, for instance, features works by his pupil Suzuki Kiitsu (1796-1858), who variously applies tarashikomi to the depiction of mountains, riffs on Hōitsu's subtle grids with a pattern of large rectangles and squares, and harkens back to his teacher's "Waves" in the composition of giant morning glories roaming across two six-paneled screens. His palette of gold, blues and greens, however, recalls Kōrin's "Irises at Yatsuhashi," which is on view at the Met. Thus a theme that begins at the Japan Society wends its way uptown.
