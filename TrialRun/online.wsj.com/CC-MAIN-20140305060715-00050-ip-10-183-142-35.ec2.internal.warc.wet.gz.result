Depositors Turn Up Heat on Ailing Spanish Banks
By
Christopher Bjork
Updated Oct. 7, 2012 10:42 p.m. ET
MOAÑA, Spain—Eugenio Nuñez Cobás stormed into a bank branch in this coastal town one morning in August with three dozen fellow customers yelling "Thieves! Thieves! Thieves!" Then they returned to the street and pelted the facade with eggs, forcing the branch to close for the day. Mr. Nuñez had been coming to the Novagalicia Banco SA branch for eight months with a placard that reads: "I have all my savings trapped in Novagalicia Banco until the year 2999." The 70-year-old retiree said: "I really...

Tech Giant Arrested Its Slide in Some Key Areas, but Pressures Will Intensify

One good quarter doesn't equal a turnaround. Hewlett-Packard's fiscal fourth-quarter results for the period ended Oct. 31 brought some relief to its long-suffering shareholders. Finding a surprise $1 billion in extra revenue in what has been a challenging quarter for technology firms is worth noting, especially for H-P—It has missed Wall Street's revenue targets in five of the past eight quarters. The company also managed to boost...

Updated Oct. 3, 2013 7:40 p.m. ET
At 4:45 p.m. on Thursday, the Twitter account for Mashable—one of the earliest movers into the now endless world of social media news sites—sent out its 60th tweet for the day. The tweet itself wasn't particularly interesting, but what happened next was a small window into one of the biggest challenges Twitter will face as it seeks to convince investors that its more than 215 million users are one of the web's most lucrative—and undeveloped—advertising audiences. View Graphics
Within minutes, hundreds of other Twitter accounts reposted the Mashable tweet word for word—more than 400 of them within the first 15 minutes. Scrolling through the never-ending list of those copycats is like a deep dive into the Twitter netherworld, one that regular users would seldom find themselves in. Twitter's more than 215 million users range from everyday people to a constellation of robots and spammers, so how can advertisers work out who's who? Tom Gara discusses on MoneyBeat. Photo: Getty Images.
Beyond the Biebers and Mashables, the CNNs and Kardashians, is a Twitter world populated by millions of accounts of questionable legitimacy. They range from entirely robotic (and often incomprehensible) spammers to more cleverly programmed accounts spitting out tweets designed to find their way into the occasional search results or discussion thread. One reason these bots exist is the vibrant gray market in buying and selling Twitter accounts that have a following. Just like lists of working email addresses can be sold to junk mail marketers, so too can Twitter accounts with thousands of followers. Who's Who at Twitter Read about Twitter's leaders and founders.

Related Articles Twitter Reveals $1 Billion IPO Plan How Twitter's Hashtag Came to Be Success, After Founders' Exit Instagram Will Begin Carrying Advertising Recap: Everything You Need to Know Tweets That Will Go Down in Twitter History IPO Plan: Don't Do What Facebook Did Twitter's Founders: Where Are They Now? Twitter Looks Upwardly Mobile High Definition: Please Twitter, Stay Weird Twitter Seeks to Expand in San Francisco NFL Strikes Deal With Twitter Twitter Buys Mobile Ad Firm MoPub Another reason so many of these accounts are out there is that they are so easy to create and automate, thanks to the way Twitter allows automatic posting using third-party applications. Twitter Inc. has long said it is working to stamp out spam on the site, and in April 2012 announced it had filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco against a group of companies it said were the most aggressive spammers of the site. "While spam is a small fraction of the incredible content you can find on Twitter, we know just how distracting it can be," the company said at the time. A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on Thursday. In the IPO documents filed Thursday, Twitter estimates that "false or spam accounts" make up less than 5% of the site's 215 million monthly active users. With that said, its definition of active user varies from the typical "unique" user measured by most websites. "We treat multiple accounts held by a single person or organization as multiple users for purposes of calculating our active users," the company said. The company also said automated accounts that send regular tweets could be counted as active users. Such accounts would fit into a broad category of Twitter usage that is neither human nor junk: Automated accounts set up by companies, publishers, charities or just plain Twitter hobbyists. They believe they are creating useful services by tweeting daily weather forecasts for any given city, or show times for local movies, or all the news headlines related to a certain topic. Combined, they create a strange situation: Twitter is essentially an advertising-supported media company, but a segment of its user accounts can't be considered "eyeballs" in the traditional sense of the term. Working out where the humans end and the robots begin—and separating the good robots from the bad—will be a big question facing the post-IPO Twitter. While a site like Facebook

has a fairly well-defined way to categorize its users—there are personal profiles for individuals, brand pages for businesses, fan pages for celebrities—the boundaries in Twitter are less clearly delineated. Twitter has long spoken of a philosophical difference with Facebook in its approach to identity, with Twitter believing it is in the best interest of users and the service as a whole to allow multiple accounts per user, as well as pseudonymous and parody accounts. Facebook has been more insistent on genuine identities, and argues this is one of its major advantages as an advertising medium. That difference in philosophy leads to some of the great joys of Twitter. There are parody accounts, posting in character as the Big Ben clock tower or as Kim Kierkegaard,
a hybrid of Kim Kardashian
and the Danish existentialist Soren Kierkegaard.
There are conceptual accounts, tweeting World War II in real time or working their way through every word in the English language, one at a time. But at the other end of the spectrum, Twitter's looser concept of identity also means the site is populated with plenty of meaningless junk. Those accounts are adding little but inflation of closely watched metrics, like the number of tweets posted on a certain topic, the number of followers on any given account, or the number of retweets of a post. Consider @Web_Consult_, one of those reposting Thursday afternoon's Mashable tweet. It has 433 followers, follows 571 people, and has posted more than 34,000 times since it began in September 2011—about 50 times a day. Its most recent 20 tweets were all nothing but Mashable headlines. Scroll quickly through its most recent few hundred and it looks like that is all it does. There are a couple of plausible explanations for what @Web_Consult_ is up to. It could be a regular person, trying their best to use Twitter and build up a following. The other is that this account is a robot. If the former is true, then anybody analyzing the quality of the Twitter audience will need to factor in that some users are engaging with the site in a pretty limited way. Attempts to contact @Web_Consult_ were unsuccessful. It was still posting Mashable headlines as of Thursday evening. Enlarge Image
Either way, for brands keeping an eye on their follower numbers or tracking the volume of discussion around a given topic, is there much value in counting an account like @Web_Consult_ alongside regular users? Twitter is likely already being asked these kinds of questions by brands focusing more of their promotional efforts on the service. And as the company begins to take money from the public, and answer to that public, the big question is: What more can the company do about these kinds of accounts. Facebook grappled with a similar challenge, and as a public company, now discloses what it believes to be its number of fake or duplicate accounts (as of the end of 2012, its guess was 76 million, or about 7% of its total membership base). Twitter is now disclosing a similar estimate of false users, but has an even more important question to answer: If its hundreds of millions of users range from everyday people to a constellation of robots and spammers, how can advertisers and the rest of its users work out who's who? Write to Tom Gara at tom.gara@wsj.com Corrections & Amplifications An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Twitter's advertisers pay to insert their messages into the streams of users. Advertisers only pay Twitter when users interact with a sponsored message. Email

Samsung Electronics knows that it needs to achieve some measure of independence from Google. Its latest gizmo releases show it isn't sure how to get there. Samsung unveiled its latest flagship phone Monday, the Galaxy S5, and it made little progress in standing out from the pack. It features a simpler user interface and fewer unique software features, suggesting the company is toning down efforts to customize Google's Android...

Updated Oct. 15, 2013 12:01 a.m. ET
WASHINGTON—Top Senate leaders said they were within striking distance of an agreement Monday to reopen the federal government and defuse a looming debt crisis just days before the U.S. could run out of money to pay its bills. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
(D., Nev.) said on the Senate floor that the leaders had made "tremendous progress" toward a deal and that he was hopeful Tuesday would be a "bright day." The Senate's Republican leader, Mitch McConnell
of Kentucky, seconded Mr. Reid's optimism. "We've had a good day," he said. Enlarge Image

Associated Press The White House postponed a planned afternoon meeting of congressional leaders with President Barack Obama,
saying the schedule change would give Senate leaders time to hash out a deal. The latest proposal would reopen the government at current spending levels until Jan. 15 and extend the federal borrowing limit until early February, according to aides familiar with the talks. Lawmakers also would begin longer-term negotiations on the budget, with the task of reaching an agreement by Dec. 13. Even before the deal was unveiled, it provoked grumbling Monday night among restive House Republicans. Enlarge Image
Mr. McConnell said Monday he expected to "get a result that will be acceptable to both sides."
Associated Press More Live Updates Obama, McConnell Discuss Treasury's Debt-Ceiling Powers Obama: We'll See if 'Progress Is Real' European Stocks Rise Taking the Bus on Road to Default By setting up yet another series of fiscal deadlines, the agreement, if embraced, would carry the hallmark of other deadline-driven deals that have become typical of the increasingly polarized Capitol. As of Monday night, Senate leaders said they were within striking distance of a deal to sidestep a debt crisis and reopen the government, and a mid-afternoon meeting with President Obama was postponed so talks could continue. Jerry Seib reports. Photo: AP.
"Everybody realizes that whatever happens, we're going to be litigating this another day," said Sen. John Thune
of South Dakota, a member of the Senate GOP leadership. Still, a deal would mark a major breakthrough in the impasse that has gripped Washington for weeks, shutting federal agencies and threatening the government with a debt default. Stock prices, which have been sensitive to turns in the saga, showed modest gains Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 64.15 points, or 0.42%, to close at 15301.26. Bond markets were closed for the Columbus Day holiday. In Asia, shares rose early Tuesday on optimism for a deal. The proposed agreement's framework included no major alterations to the 2010 health-care law that Mr. Obama championed and congressional Republicans have tried to curtail. However, lawmakers appeared to be weighing some minor changes, including new procedures to verify the incomes of some people receiving government subsidies for health-insurance costs. Lawmakers also appeared to be considering delaying for a year a fee of $63 per insured person levied on those who offer policies, including employers, unions and insurance carriers. The likely beneficiaries of the fee would be traditional insurance carriers, which are required to sell policies to everyone, regardless of medical history, and so could see customers incur major bills. Large employers and unions that provide coverage say the levy is unfair and they can't afford it, and have fought for an exemption. One point of tension was whether the deal would include a limit that Republicans want to place on "emergency" powers that the Treasury has used to extend past debt-ceiling deadlines and avoid falling behind on the nation's bills. The dispute is significant enough that Mr. Obama raised it in a phone call Monday with Mr. McConnell, two people familiar with the call said. The Treasury department, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, has used these powers for decades to extend the amount of time the government can continue borrowing money and making payments at times when the nation has hit or neared its debt ceiling but Congress hasn't yet extended U.S. borrowing authority. Republicans say limiting those powers would ensure that the next debt-ceiling extension is a hard deadline. But Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has been adamant that Treasury needs the powers to maintain flexibility, in part because of how uncertain debt ceiling votes can be in Congress, two people familiar with the matter said. Republicans who entered the budget battle determined to gut the health law have steadily scaled back their demands in the face of Democratic resistance. Still, many could find it hard to accept the Senate proposal, especially if it makes no changes to the health law. Some House Republicans would likely resist the deal, putting House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) in a tight spot. Mr. Boehner could face a rebellion from the House's most fiscally conservative lawmakers, many of whom were elected with tea-party support. That would force Mr. Boehner to rely on Democrats to pass the Senate measure. The lack of immediate spending cuts, as well as the absence of major changes to the health law, could prompt conservative opposition. "I can't vote for something that doesn't have substantive spending cuts right now,'' said Rep. Joe Barton
(R., Texas). Many House Republicans declined to comment until they saw the final Senate proposal. Some still were smarting from Mr. Obama's decision to end discussions with them on Friday, which effectively sidelined the House GOP and accelerated talks in the Senate. The House offer abandoned many of the GOP's initial policy demands. It would have raised the debt ceiling for six weeks without making other policy changes. But it didn't appear to contain any explicit agreement to reopen the government immediately. "We believed that we could have worked with the president," said Rep. Pete Sessions (R., Texas) "and then the president dropped us like a hot potato." The potential Senate deal would do nothing for now to solve one of the biggest fiscal issues dividing the two parties: potential adjustments to the across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester, another round of which are due in January. By funding the government only until that point, lawmakers would give themselves time to discuss changes. First established as part of a 2011 budget deal to avert an earlier debt crisis, the sequester's next reductions would cut annual spending to $967 billion from the current $986 billion. Both parties consider the sequester a blunt budgeting tool. Republicans want spending to fall to the level dictated by the sequester, but favor making the cuts more targeted or replacing them with savings extracted from health and safety-net programs. The GOP is particularly concerned that military spending will bear the biggest brunt of the January cuts. Democrats have sought to eliminate the scheduled cuts in part by bringing in more revenue. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) said that both parties will be motivated to revisit the issue before the cuts take effect. Creating pressure for lawmakers to reach an agreement by then "could bring people to a place where we solve this problem and put in place the mandatory reforms that are better for our country," he said. Mr. Obama, speaking to reporters Monday while visiting a food and family services charity in Washington, warned that "if we don't start making some real progress both in the House and Senate…we stand a good chance of defaulting, and defaulting would have a potentially devastating effect on our economy." The Treasury says that by Thursday it will have just $30 billion in cash left to pay bills, which would last only a week or two. Some Republicans have argued that the party should take steps to reopen the government quickly. Many fear that the shutdown has hurt the party's image and say the GOP should move to shift the debate to deficit reduction, where public support is stronger. "This has been a disastrous experience for the Republican Party,'' said former Sen. Judd Gregg
(R., N.H.). "It is marginalized us with the American people and made us look like we don't care about governing.'' Some Republicans didn't want to reopen the government until talks with Mr. Obama had started on long-term fiscal issues. Others wanted the government to remain closed until they had extracted concessions from Democrats on the health law. It was unclear how they would react to the Senate's proposal to open the government immediately and fund it through mid-January. The talks between Messrs. Reid and McConnell began in earnest Saturday with their first meeting since the partial government shutdown started Oct. 1. The negotiations continued over the weekend with a phone call between the two leaders on Sunday and a meeting in Mr. McConnell's office earlier Monday. The Senate discussions arose after talks between House Republicans and the White House hit an impasse late last week. A bipartisan group of roughly a dozen senators had been working on a plan that formed the initial framework for the Senate leader's talks. —Jared A.

'Man of Steel' is just the latest reboot of the 75-year-old story.
Associated Press When Superman returns to the big screen on June 14 as the star of "Man of Steel," he'll be doing a lot of heavy lifting for a character who turned 75 this year. Untold legions of Superman fans spanning both the continents and the decades can rattle off his celebrated "powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men": super strength, super speed, super vision, and the ability to fly. But not least among his more amazing powers has been a superhuman charisma and ever-enduring appeal. In Superman's various incarnations over the years, he usually isn't reborn as someone fundamentally different from the character first seen in Action Comics No. 1—except in alternate-universe and "elseworlds" stories, like the intriguing "Red Son" comic book miniseries of 2003, which postulated what might have happened had the Kryptonian rocket landed in the Soviet Union rather than the American Midwest. Just the same, Superman's mythology has been continually fine-tuned and rewritten, most recently in the 2009 series "Secret Origins," and expanded in the two bestselling "Earth One" graphic novels of 2010 and 2012. One point that seems constantly up for grabs: the number of individuals, both heroes (Supergirl) and villains (General Zod)—and even animals (Krypto the Superdog)—who actually survived the destruction of Krypton. The recasting began early. When Superman made his first appearance in print, it was explained that he was raised in an orphanage on Earth after a "passing motorist" stumbled across the rocket containing the superinfant. Then, in June 1939, when Superman became the first comic-book character to star in his own self-titled publication, his background was retrofitted to become somewhat closer to the story we know today, in which the toddler of steel was raised by a kindly elderly couple named Kent. It wasn't until 1949 that Superman himself became aware that he was a "strange visitor from another planet." Superman stories have proliferated in every medium, beginning with his two extremely long-running comic-book titles and a newspaper comic strip that launched in 1938-39. A radio series aired from 1940 to 1951, and Max Fleischer,
best known for Betty Boop, produced the original animated series, which ran in movie theaters in 1941-1943. The first live-action depiction—a pair of Saturday-morning serials—arrived in 1948 and 1950. These, in turn, led to a true classic of early television, the 104 episodes of "Adventures of Superman" (1952-58), which continue to captivate millions of kids in perpetual reruns and home-video releases. Lovers of "I Love Lucy" also have long cherished the unforgettable 1957 episode of that series in which TV's Superman (
George Reeves
) rescues Lucy (
Lucille Ball
) after one of her harebrained schemes backfires. "Do you mean to say that you've been married to her for 15 years?" Superman asks Ricky (
Desi Arnaz
). "And they call me Superman!" Clearly, Jerry Seinfeld
was right: the Man of Steel's most compelling power is a super sense of humor. For the past 35 years, in particular, Superman has been especially omnipresent. Four big-screen, big-budget features, from 1978 to 1987, starred Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel. In 1989, Superman launched a marathon run of TV series that only a superhero could keep up with: "Superboy," "Lois and Clark," "Superman: the Animated Series" and "Smallville" have kept him in front of viewers with barely a pause to change his tights from 1988 to 2011. The expectations for a Superman project have soared so high that the 2006 theatrical feature "Superman Returns" was considered a failure even though it grossed nearly $400 million. The new "Man of Steel" will have what this 21st-century predecessor didn't: an origin story, which brings it more in line with such successes as "Batman Begins," as well as biopics like "Ray" and "Walk the Line." Superman has also been a persistent icon in popular music, from a dedicatory piece by Benny Goodman
in 1940 to the ingenious 1966 Broadway musical "It's a Bird . . . It's a Plane . . . It's Superman," which was recently restaged by City Center Encores! in New York with Edward Watts
as the Baritone of Steel. There were also less flattering musical depictions, such as the 1979 "Rapper's Delight," in which the Sugar Hill Gang denigrates him as someone "flying through the air in pantyhose." In print, even more than in movies and on TV, Superman continues to be a juggernaut. He still appears in multiple comic-book titles a month and is the subject of at least three serious "biographies" in the past year, including Larry Tye's
"Superman: The High-Flying History of America's Most Enduring Hero" and Brad Ricca's
"Super Boys: The Amazing Adventures of Jerry Siegel
and Joe Shuster
—the Creators of Superman." Apart from his obvious gifts, Superman's capacity for continual rebooting has kept him fresh from generation to generation: from leaping tall buildings in 1938 to traversing the solar system and even traveling through time in the 1960s and '70s, to surviving both death and matrimony in more recent decades. With "Man of Steel," it's a sure bet that yet another generation of youngsters will be tying red towels around their necks and pretending that they can fly. Mr. Friedwald writes the weekly "Jazz Scene" column for the Journal. Email

LAHORE, Pakistan—A conservative former Pakistani prime minister ousted in a 1999 military coup, Nawaz Sharif,
headed toward leading the nuclear-armed nation for the third time after Saturday's election that also turned populist cricket legend Imran Khan
into a major political force, according to nearly complete results. Mr. Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N was leading the vote count in 127 constituencies out of 272. Mr. Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, which boycotted the previous election in 2008, was leading in 34 races, while the Pakistan Peoples Party that controlled the previous government trailed in third place with 30 seats. With independents and small parties eager to back a winner, this showing would make it easy for Mr. Sharif to form the next government of the world's fifth largest democracy. Election Day

More on Pakistan Election Sharif: Would Mend U.S. Ties If Elected Karachi Beset by Political Strife Political Dynasties Shape Course of Election Candidates Hop Parties With Little Resistance The election would mark the first time in Pakistan's coup-ridden history that a civilian government served a full five-year term and transferred power to another elected administration. Turnout was close to 60%, according the country's election commission, much higher than the 44% in the previous vote, despite Taliban threats and scattered violence that killed at least 19 people. "Pakistan needs a strong government that can take strong decisions," Mr. Sharif said as he watched the results stream in on TV in his Lahore headquarters, with cheers by supporters outside growing louder with every new projection. As his lead solidified, he came out to make a victory speech, urging supporters to pray for an outright PML-N majority by the end of the count, so that a future government could be established "without crutches." Mr. Sharif, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal after the vote, said he foresaw no new problems with the country's powerful military establishment, saying that the 1999 coup against him was the personal initiative of then-army chief Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and not the military as a whole. He also said he would work for improved relations with the U.S., India and Afghanistan. The outgoing government led by President Asif Ali Zardari's
Pakistan Peoples Party was widely perceived as corrupt, and PPP—once a major political force—was fighting neck and neck with Mr. Khan's PTI for the second place in the race, according to initial results. The Pakistani Taliban have focused their campaign of violence and intimidation that killed more than 100 people in the run-up to Saturday's vote on the PPP and its two secular allies, the Awami National Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement. In the biggest attack on election day, 11 people were killed Saturday morning in twin bombings targeting an ANP office in the southern city of Karachi, a police official said. ANP, according to initial results, would have no seats in the new federal parliament, in part because Taliban violence made it nearly impossible for its candidates to campaign. Enlarge Image
Former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif met party supporters at his residence in Lahore.
Getty Images "Tonight, while other parties will be counting their votes, we will be counting our martyrs," said Shahi Syed, the ANP's provincial chief for Sindh province, which includes Karachi."Those from other parties should remember that you may have reached parliament, but there is another parliament, of God, to face in the next life, where they will meet our martyrs." ANP controlled the previous government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the predominantly ethnic Pashtun province where much of the Taliban violence is concentrated. According to early results, Mr. Khan's PTI—which promised to shoot down American drones hunting Islamist militants—would be able to form the province's next administration. While an achievement, this result fell short of Mr. Khan's promises of a PTI "tsunami" that would upend Pakistan's political order. In a highly symbolic race in Lahore, Pakistan's wealthiest city and the election's key battleground where Mr. Khan was personally running for a parliament seat, he was defeated by a PML-N candidate. Pakistan, however, allows candidates to run in more than one constituency at the same time. Mr. Khan secured a parliament seat for himself in another area of the country. Twin bombings killed more than 11 people in Karachi, Pakistan on election day. Footage from Pakistan's Express News shows the aftermath of an explosion that took place outside the Awami National Party offices. Photo: Asif Hassan/AFP/Getty Images.
"This is an impressive showing by Imran Khan but not a tsunami," said Lahore-based political analyst Hasan Askari Rizvi. He added, however, that "Imran Khan has emerged as an important political force." Asad Umer, the election campaign manager for PTI, admitted that the election's results were "short of expectations" for the party. But, he added: "Our bottom line was achieved. This was a vote for an ideology, not a constituency-based vote." However, another party official said that the PML-N victory was a "hard blow" for Mr. Khan, and that the former cricket star would not be able to recover quickly. "He's put 17 years of his life into this. He was convinced the was going to win," said one party official.

Sen. John McCain chose first-term Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, little known on the national stage, as his vice-presidential running mate -- a surprise stroke aimed at attracting Hillary Clinton supporters, but which could undercut the campaign's key theme of experience. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin delivers her speech as McCain introduces her as his running mate Friday at the Ervin J. Nutter Center in Dayton, Ohio.
Associated Press Sen. McCain passed over many high-profile, more conventional choices for the job, turning to a woman whose solid conservative positions thrilled the Republican base. Her reputation as a reformer in Alaska dovetails with Sen. McCain's image, too. As a small-town mayor, she took on her own party elders to run for governor in 2006, as an FBI corruption probed rocked the state's political establishment. But the 44-year-old's thin political r&eacute;sum&eacute; also thrilled some Democratic strategists, given Sen. McCain's criticism of the experience of his opponent, Sen. Barack Obama. They were quick to note that Sen. McCain turned 72 Friday and would be the oldest person to enter the White House, yet he is trying to put a heartbeat from the Oval Office a woman who has spent less time in the governors' mansion than Sen. Obama has in the Senate. Just a few years ago, she was mayor of Wasilla, a town of 9,780 people. Obama spokesman Bill Burton said the choice of Gov. Palin takes the experience question "off the table." Sen. John McCain chooses Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate. She will be the first female vice-presidential nominee on a Republican presidential ticket. Video courtesy of Fox News. (Aug. 29)
Social conservatives, already wary of Sen. McCain, worried he would choose someone who -- like himself -- hasn't consistently championed their agenda. Many strongly praised the choice, especially because Gov. Palin strongly opposes abortion rights. But not all Republicans were sanguine about the political dynamics. Despite recent polls showing a close race, the campaign "clearly felt like they needed to shake this race up and go for broke," one GOP strategist said. "This is a very risky choice." The McCain campaign professed no concern about Gov. Palin's experience. Senior strategist Steve Schmidt said she is "one of the most exceptional governors in the country" with reform credentials that fit perfectly with Sen. McCain's message. "We are happy to have that debate with the Obama campaign and we'll win the argument with the American people," Mr. Schmidt said. "By any objective measure, Gov. Palin is more qualified for the presidency than Barack Obama." Most years, vice-presidential picks end up having little concrete impact on the outcome. Voters usually tell pollsters they care little about the second name on the ticket. But the 2008 race, already unusual in other ways, could be an exception, because both choices are meant to deal with key issues the presidential candidates haven't been able to solve on their own. VP Nominee ComparisonSarah Palin Current Office: Governor of Alaska Date of Birth: Feb. 11, 1964 Age: 44 Place of Birth: Sandpoint, Idaho Home: Wasilla, Alaska Education: University of Idaho, 1987 Religion: Christian Party: Republican Political Experience: Wasilla Mayor, 1996-2002. Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission Chairman, 2003-04. Elected governor in 2006. Misc.: Palin's son Track enlisted in the Army in 2007, and is scheduled to be deployed to Iraq in September. Joe Biden Current Office: U.S. Senator Date of Birth: Nov. 20, 1942 Age: 65 Place of Birth: Scranton, Pa. Home: Wilmington, Del. Religion: Catholic Education: University of Delaware, 1965; Syracuse University College of Law, 1968 Party: Democrat Political Experience: U.S. Senator from Delaware, 1972-present Misc.: Biden's son Beau, a captain in the Army National Guard, is scheduled to be deployed to Iraq in October.
The choices are mirror images in some ways. Sen. Obama, a youthful candidate promoting "change" above all, chose in Sen. Joe Biden a gray-haired career Washington politician with commander-in-chief gravitas reminiscent of his Republican opponent -- but who may weaken that campaign message for many voters. Sen. McCain's pick, like Sen. Obama, is an outsider who would represent a demographic breakthrough if elected -- and like the Democrat, is short on conventional political experience. Sen. McCain's personal interactions with his new running mate have been sparse. He first met her just six months ago, at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington. They spoke again by phone this past Sunday, the campaign said. Campaign officials would not say if they had any interactions in between. This past Wednesday evening -- as Sen. Biden was accepting his nomination on the stage in Denver -- Gov. Palin met with Sen. McCain's top advisers at a private home in Flagstaff, Ariz., that belongs to the CEO of Hensley Corp., Cindy McCain's family business. Thursday morning, Mrs. McCain and later Sen. McCain spent time with Gov. Palin at their Sedona home. About 11 a.m. on Thursday, on the deck, he invited her to join the ticket. Sen. McCain's decision was closely held, even as public speculation about his pick reached a frenzy this week. Indeed, many Republicans were puzzled because choosing a political newcomer holds special perils, which is partly why most presidential candidates pick someone with a national reputation. Sen. McCain passed over better-known figures widely thought to lead his short list: former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. A classic example of poor vetting came in 1988, when then-Vice President George Bush chose Dan Quayle as his running mate, a decision that appeared to be bold and fresh but wound up widely derided. McCain aides had said they were mindful to avoid a similar scenario. At a rally introducing Gov. Palin in Dayton, Ohio, Friday, Sen. McCain echoed the anti-Washington rhetoric that both he and Sen. Obama have often been using. "I found someone with an outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracies; someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past," he said. Republicans hope in particular that Gov. Palin will help him in his aggressive quest to woo Hillary Clinton supporters disappointed that the Democrats did not put a woman on their ticket this year. The move is the most dramatic in a series of efforts to appeal to Clinton backers. Some of those voters have shown a willingness to change party allegiance: A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll taken before this week's Democratic Convention in Denver showed that only about half of the people who had voted for Sen. Clinton in the primaries were planning to vote for Sen. Obama in the general election. About 20% said they would vote for Sen. McCain, and the rest said they were undecided. Those numbers may well have changed since Sen. Clinton, during a speech to the convention Tuesday night, strongly urged voters to support Sen. Obama. During her speech in Dayton Friday, Gov. Palin went out of her way to appeal directly to the Clinton refugees. Noting the historic nature of her own bid for the vice presidency, she paid homage first to Geraldine Ferraro, who ran on the Democratic ticket in 1984, and then to Sen. Clinton "who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign." She repeated Sen. Clinton's line that she had "left 18 million cracks" in the glass ceiling that keeps women from only rising so far, a reference to the Clinton vote total in the Democratic primaries. "It turns out the women in America aren't finished yet, and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all," Gov. Palin said. It's an open question how many Clinton supporters would move to support McCain based on the choice, if Gov. Palin's politics don't match Sen. Clinton's. Sen. Clinton herself released a statement saying "we all should be proud of Governor Sarah Palin's historic nomination," but continued that her policies "would take America in the wrong direction." In Michigan, a swing state, Cynthia Kidder calls herself independent and has a child born with Down Syndrome, as does Gov. Palin. Yet her excitement about Gov. McCain's choice will not translate into a vote for the Republican ticket, she said, because she is more concerned about the economy and Iraq, where her oldest son is now serving in the military. "It's a great choice for McCain," Ms. Kidder said, "but I have never been a single-issue voter." That reaction may be shared by women voters, said Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster. "Women voters in particular are not linear voters, thank God," she said. "Give us some credit. We don't just say, 'Oh, there's a woman on the ticket, I'll vote for her.'" Ms. Conway recently polled likely voters and found that 62% said the gender of Sen. McCain's running mate would not influence their decision. But Amy Siskind, a big Democratic fundraiser from Westchester, N.Y., and a proud backer of Ms. Clinton, said she would now make a switch after voting Democratic "up and down the ticket," all her life. She had decided there was no way she would vote for Sen. Obama after the bruising primary campaign Sen. McCain's announcement Friday sealed her decision, she said, even though she disagrees with his party's opposition to abortion rights: "I'm voting Republican." Gov. Palin's staunch opposition to abortion rights pleased religious conservatives who had grown fearful as Sen. McCain publicly toyed with the idea of picking a pro-choice running mate, such as Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge. "We are thrilled," said Charmaine Yoest, president of Americans United for Life Action, an anti-abortion group. In an email message, she wrote: "It's a BRILLIANT pick. In one move he energizes pro-lifers AND reaches out to Hillary supporters." Overall, the pick went over well with the Republican Party's conservative base -- long wary of Sen. McCain, who has struggled during the campaign to keep party loyalists in line. Her personal narrative is also a potential boon, helping compete with the stories of personal trial and tragedy, and of working-class roots, that dominated the Democratic convention in Denver all week -- from Sens. Obama and Biden, and from Sen. Obama's wife, Michelle. Gov. Palin's husband last year earned $46,790 working at an oil production facility on Prudhoe Bay, and a similar amount doing seasonal work as a commercial fisherman, according to her financial forms. Her oldest son Track, like Sen. Biden's son Beau, is in the military and is set to be sent soon to Iraq. Gov. Palin herself emphasized her personal side in her first national appearance. She called herself an "average hockey mom," and spoke of her children. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins highlighted the recent birth of her fifth child, who has Down syndrome, saying that "she has also lived out her personal beliefs... In an era when over 80% of Down Syndrome babies are aborted, the Palins feel they have been extremely blessed by God to raise 'an absolutely perfect' son." Gov. Palin portrays herself as a crusading government reformer, much like Sen. McCain. Her popularity in Alaska has soared as high as 83% as she has sacked political appointees with close ties to industry lobbyists and shelved pork projects by fellow Republicans. In her remarks Friday, Gov. Palin singled out the congressional earmark that Sen. McCain loves to hate. "I told Congress 'thanks but no thanks' on that bridge to nowhere," she said, referring to a controversial proposal for a $400-million link to a sparsely populated area in southeastern Alaska that had been championed by Alaska's congressional delegation. Sen. John McCain's vice-presidential running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, is introduced at a rally in Dayton, Ohio.
Associated Press A native of Idaho who grew up in Alaska hunting and fishing, Gov. Palin gained local acclaim for being named Miss Wasilla in 1984. She then was named Miss Congeniality and first runner-up in the Miss Alaska contest the same year. As mayor of Wasilla, which is 45 miles north of Anchorage, Gov. Palin tried to slim down the size of the city's government and dropped three property taxes. And the future governor showed her independent flair -- attending a campaign event for conservative insurgent Pat Buchanan in 1999 and brandishing a "Buchanan" button. In office, Gov. Palin set an earthier style than her predecessors. She sold the private jet Mr. Murkowski used to get around Alaska, relying instead on commercial airlines and her family's Jetta and a state-issued black Suburban. "I love to drive," she says. She also waved off a security escort, driving herself to and from work every day from Wasilla. Gov. Palin also loves to run to burn off steam. Before giving birth in April, she said she was running seven to 10 miles almost every day but switched to aerobics classes at her gym when she became pregnant. She has worked her way back up to running three miles every other day, she said in an interview with WSJ Magazine, scheduled for publication next Saturday. She opted to board a jet from Dallas last May while about to deliver a child. At eight months pregnant, she says she felt a few contractions shortly before she was to give a keynote speech to an energy summit of governors in Dallas. But she says she went ahead with it after her doctor in Alaska advised her to put her feet up to rest. "I was not going to miss that speech," she says. She rushed so quickly from the podium afterwards that Texas Gov. Rick Perry nervously asked if she was about to deliver the baby then. She made it to the airport, and gave birth hours after landing in Anchorage to Trig. "Maybe they shouldn't have let me fly, but I wasn't showing much so they didn't know," she says. While she revels in her reformer role, Ms. Palin has not been free of controversy herself. In July, she fired Alaska Department of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan. He later said that Gov. Palin and her husband had pressured him to remove a state trooper who had been married to her sister and feuded with the family. Gov. Palin denied that, saying she removed the commissioner she appointed 18 months earlier because she wanted "a new direction," and offered him a job as liquor board director which he turned down. Some legislators have called for an investigation into the affair. "This is going to show people just how vindictive and obsessed the Palins were with this guy," says Andrew Halcro, a rental-car executive in Anchorage and fellow Republican who ran against her in the 2006 gubernatorial contest. "It's not going to be pretty." None of this has put much of a dent in her popularity among most Alaskans, though. Striding out of her downtown office with just a press aide and reporter in tow one June afternoon, a woman passing by pointed her finger at the distinctive-looking governor and said, "Are you...? Oh my God! I like you, although I don't always agree with you." McCain's Pick

As a boy growing up in Texas, J. Luther King Jr. hunted for arrowheads on his family's farm. "It's a rush to pick up something that's been lying there on the ground for hundreds of years," says King, whose downtown Fort Worth, Texas, office features artwork made from arrowheads he has found or collected over the years. "I don't do it much anymore, but when I'm out, I can't help but look at the ground." For King, 73, that compulsion to see what others overlook has, for decades, been focused on the stock market. More than just the figurehead of Luther King Capital Management, the firm he started in 1979, King goes into the office on weekends, makes company visits, and works closely with his nearly 20-person research team. Luther King mixes top-down sector calls with bottom-up analysis of stocks for growth and stability.
Dan Sellers for Barron's While most of its $12.5 billion in assets under management are held in separate accounts, the firm runs eight of its own mutual funds, including the $244 million LKCM Equity Institutional
fund (ticker: LKEQX). Over the past five years, it has averaged annual returns of about 6.9%, better than 92% of its large-growth peers. Although King launched the fund in late 1995 to serve institutional clients with smaller portfolios, the no-load fund is available to retail investors with a $2,000 minimum. (The word "institutional" in its name is a bit of a misnomer.) Still, the firm hasn't gone out of its way to market the fund. "Some years ago, it started to get noticed because of results," says King, whose fund tends to hold up better than its peers in turbulent markets. "Now, as it gets larger, it's attracting more interest." After graduating from college and serving in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, King planned to save for law school when a job in the credit department of a regional bank sent him on a lifelong detour into finance. That experience became "the North Star guiding my investment philosophy," he says. "It taught me the danger of excessive leverage and sloppy accounting." To be sure, if there's one common theme with the 80 to 90 holdings in the LKCM Equity fund, it's a bias toward financially sound companies that are among the leaders in their respective niches. "Some people would say we're very Buffett-like," he says, referring to Warren Buffett's taste for keeping it simple, buying on bad news -- he's currently keeping 9% of his portfolio in cash for when fear takes hold. "I think the market will be higher at the end of the year, but I'm willing to hold that cash because I think we might get a dip," he says. Turnover has averaged just 23% in the last five years. King and his team combine top-down views on individual sectors -- for example, the portfolio was recently overweight industrials and underweight financials -- with bottom-up analysis that emphasizes the return on equity and cash flow, as well as the stability and predictability of those numbers. Though the fund sits in the large-cap space, it tends to punch below its weight with a weighted-average market cap of $84 billion and the flexibility to invest in companies of all sizes. King and his team meet with more than 1,000 companies a year and are prolific in their research. "This isn't just three guys and a Bloomberg machine managing a fund," says King, adding that he prefers to spend money on research than on marketing; if performance is strong, he figures, word will get out. Within most sectors he follows a hub-and-spoke approach, mixing companies that provide stability with those that provide growth. Take energy.

"Cabot is a Marcellus gas play," says King, referring to the massive underground shale formation stretching from upstate New York to West Virginia, and as far west as Ohio.

Current valuations, he says, are justified given the company's recent history of "mediocre returns," but King doesn't think that will be the case for long. "A number of the big pharmaceutical companies have done things in the past year or two to enhance shareholder value beyond just research and development of new drugs," he notes. Merck has begun to follow suit by increasing its dividend and repurchasing shares. The industrial space is a little more nuanced, ranging from $71 billion Union Pacific
