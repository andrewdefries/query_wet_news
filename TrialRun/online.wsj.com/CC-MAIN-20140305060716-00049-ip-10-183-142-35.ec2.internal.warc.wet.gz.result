Cracks are showing in the Democratic coalition as the next round of budget talks gets under way, hurting the chances for progress toward a broad deal that changes the tax code and significantly narrows future deficits. While Republicans are still smarting over nasty infighting they engaged in during the debt-ceiling fight and 16-day government shutdown, Democrats have stayed united. This helped them beat back Republican demands to...

's initial round of safety inspections in Bangladesh failed their audits and had to make improvements to keep doing business with the giant retailer. Wal-Mart said most of the three dozen factories were able to correct the problems or are in the process of doing so. One seven-story factory, for example, had to knock down an illegally built eighth floor, the retailer said. The company stopped doing business with two factories that failed the safety audits and couldn't sufficiently fix the problems discovered. One factory had to be closed completely. Related Retailers Wary of Health Law Wal-Mart will release the results of 75 inspections on its website and add others as they are completed, a step no other major Western retailer has taken. The company currently does business with more than 200 factories in Bangladesh, and has pledged to inspect all of them. It previously said it would begin posting results of the inspections by last June. Wal-Mart is making the moves to get a handle on its supply chain in the wake of deadly disasters at factories that did work for the company and other retailers. The company, based in Bentonville, Ark., is among the largest buyers of apparel made in Bangladesh, and its relentless focus on cost has made it a target for critics of working conditions in the impoverished nation. In the past the retailer hadn't regularly named the factories from which it buys clothing. But an April building collapse that killed more than 1,100 Bangladesh garment workers and deadly fires at other facilities focused international attention on the way Western retailers obtain cheap clothing. "We've spent $4 million on these audits, and we're not done yet," Jay Jorgensen,
Wal-Mart's global chief compliance officer, said in an interview. "There's a lot of progress left to be made." During an October safety audit at Epic Garments Manufacturing Co., a factory near Dhaka, engineers hired by Wal-Mart checked on new red fire doors and outside staircases that had been installed to make evacuation easier in case of a fire and to prevent flames from spreading from stock rooms to factory floors. "Fireproof doors and materials weren't even available in Bangladesh," Epic Group Chief Executive Ranjan Mahtani said in an October interview at his plant "We had to fly them in from abroad and teach local manufacturers how to make them." He said he had already spent $300,000 on safety improvements to meet standards set by Wal-Mart and other Western retailers. The published audits won't offer specific findings about conditions at the factories, such as whether there are too few exits or if a building's columns are capable of bearing the weight of the structure. Rather, they will give a general risk assessment based on a letter grade that ranges from A through D. Wal-Mart said it would stop production at factories that receive a D rating, though the factories have a chance to correct the problems and go through another assessment. Critics say the disclosures don't provide enough information to workers and others who want to keep tabs on factory improvements. "I am struck by how little real information they are providing," said Scott Nova,
executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a Washington labor-monitoring group. "They offer no specifics whatsoever as to the dangers workers face in these factories, all we get is a scoring system that is largely opaque." Wal-Mart said the letter-grade system aims to help give people an easily understandable overview of the safety situation in a given factory. Jan Saumweber, Wal-Mart's head of ethical sourcing, said she plans to increase her staff by 40% this year and add a team of 10 engineers to the company's Bangladesh sourcing office to regularly inspect factories. Ms. Saumweber took over the ethical sourcing job in September when Rajan Kamalanathan stepped down after a decade-long tenure at Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart said it will also start to incorporate safety standards into merchants' incentive-based compensation and train buyers to take safety into account when placing orders with factories. "These are big changes, and the company takes this very seriously," Ms. Saumweber said. Wal-Mart has said it would put up $50 million in low-interest loans to help factories make building improvements. No factories have tapped the financing offer so far, the company said. Write to Shelly Banjo at shelly.banjo@wsj.com Corrections & Amplifications More than 15% of factories in Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s initial round of safety inspections in Bangladesh failed their audits and had to make improvements to keep doing business with the giant retailer. An earlier version of this article said nearly half the factories had failed. Email

PARIS—
Maurice Hadida's
collection of rare stamps includes an 1852 envelope mailed from Tangier, and the first-ever English stamp sent from Morocco to Britain, in 1860. Mr. Hadida's album, philatelists agree, is one of the most original and impressive in the world. But to win a top prize at the world stamp-collecting championship in London in May, Mr. Hadida has to stick it to two formidable competitors: a collector of Icelandic naval-mail stamps and an expert on Siberian Railway postage. Letters sent from the North Pole or remote whaling stations are particularly in vogue at the moment. Stamp collector Maurice Hadida.
Max Colchester/The Wall Street Journal Collectors' Paradise See some of the Web sites with useful information for stamps collectors. Online Catalogs: National Postal Museum 1847USA Jim Griffith's Stamp Album Alphabetilately Collectors' clubs: American Philatelic Society United States Stamp Society U.S. Philatelic Classics Society Listings of rare and valuable stamps: World's Most Valuable Stamps Rare Stamps Index "It won't be easy," said the 58-year-old insurance-company executive as he flicked through a pile of brown faded envelopes at an outdoor stamp market here in Paris one Sunday recently. "Finding a rare envelope is like wooing a beautiful lady," continued the Moroccan-born Frenchman. "The harder the chase, the better it feels in the end." Mr. Hadida is one of the world's top philatelists—an eclectic group of stamp-collecting fanatics whose thousands of members include business executives, politicians and dignitaries such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy
and Queen Elizabeth II
of England. Despite the number of enthusiasts, the art of collecting postal material is on the wane. The pastime, which started in the mid-19th century and was coined philatelie by a Frenchman in 1864—is suffering as young people increasingly turn to the Internet for communication and distraction. "Young people no longer need to turn to stamps to discover the world," says Joseph Wolff,
the president of the International Federation of Philately. "They just turn on their computer." At its highest reaches, the hobby is increasingly competitive. Only about 2,000 people in the world have collections that are good enough to be eligible for international competitions, according to the Universal Postal Union, the organization that coordinates postal policies around the world. Applicants can submit material in different categories including postal history; aerophilately, the study of airmail, and maximaphily, the study of postcards. But to qualify, collectors must have a track record of victories in local and national contests— a considerable investment of time, collectors say. It's also expensive: One of the most valuable stamps in the world currently is an orange, 1847 one-penny stamp from the island of Mauritius. It is known in philatelic circles as the Mona Lisa of stamps; only two exist and each has an estimated value of $4 million, according to Paris stamp broker Pascal Behr.
To prepare for the London competition, which is one of the most prestigious, Mr. Hadida has spent the past few months scouring the Internet, reading philatelic magazines and talking with stamp dealers. Even the hours spent gazing at and arranging his collection are worthwhile, he says. "When I see a stamp, I am touched by its beauty." The first stamp ever, called a "Penny Black," was made in the U.K. in 1840, and stamp collecting began shortly thereafter. As the pastime took off around the world, clubs sprang up in several countries, and the first international stamp exhibition was held in 1881, according to the International Federation of Philately.

Maurice Hadida France, which started mass producing stamps in 1849, has one of the richest philatelic cultures in the world. One of the oldest stamp books was made in Paris in 1862. For the next century, France was a philately powerhouse, with many Frenchmen winning international stamp-collecting competitions, according to Jean-François Logette,
the head of the philately service at the Universal Postal Union. But in the 1970s, when several big French stamp collectors died, their families put up their albums for auction, and France lost much of its stamp heritage, Mr. Logette says. According to the Fédération Française des Associations Philatéliques, which groups all the philatelic associations in France, stamp-club membership has fallen to 40,000 from 60,000 in the past decade. In 2007, Mr. Sarkozy tried to re-invigorate the hobby by ordering the French Post Office to make nicer stamps to attract new collectors. Mr. Hadida fell in love with stamps while growing up in southern France, and he joined a local philatelic association in his early twenties. There, a mentor urged him to focus on Morocco. Few philatelists had paid much attention to stamps from the former French colony. Mr. Hadida refined his search even further: His envelopes follow the life span of the French post office of Tangier, which opened in 1852 and closed late in 1924. Mauritius Stamp
Over the past 31 years, Mr. Hadida has collected several hundred envelopes, though he says he has never actually counted how many pieces he has. Among his prized stamps is the first envelope sent by Moroccan airmail in 1911. His stamp from 1852 is believed to be on the second-oldest franked envelope ever sent by a French post office in Morocco. As he prepares for the London contest, however, Mr. Hadida, who has won other prizes, has a hurdle to overcome: Collecting postal material from old French colonies isn't fashionable. The stamp craze of the moment centers on adventure, including expeditions to the poles and mail sent from whaling stations or space stations. Mr. Logette says the next big philatelic trend will probably be postal material depicting climate change. "It could interest young people," he says. Recently, Mr. Hadida, who won't talk about how much money he has spent on stamps, has been redoubling his efforts. He bought his 1860 stamp—which is on the first envelope sent from Morocco to Britain with an English stamp—at an auction in Barcelona. A photograph of the envelope has since been featured on a new stamp created by the Gibraltar Post Office. He is also continuing his 30-year quest for a letter bearing a postmark from the small town of Mequinez, in the north of Morocco. He bid twice for it at auction, but was beaten. "If I told Maurice I had a nice Moroccan stamp, he would run here naked if he had to," says Mr. Behr, the stamp broker in Paris. "You never know where a good piece will turn up," Mr. Hadida said while standing in the rain at the stamp market. "It's like looking for gold." Write to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com Email

When Picking A Pope Was A Perilous Affair
For much of Church history, the selection of a new pope meant corruption and conflict. By
Eamon Duffy
Feb. 15, 2013 8:26 p.m. ET
The conclave that assembles at the Vatican on March 15 will be the first for six centuries to elect a pope while his predecessor is alive. With 118 names to choose from and no obvious front-runner (as yet), the outcome is impossible to predict. But we can be sure that the pope will be chosen from the cardinals themselves. For much of the Church's history, not even that much has been certain. The cardinals didn't become the normal papal electors until the mid-11th century, and the first formal conclave wasn't held until...
