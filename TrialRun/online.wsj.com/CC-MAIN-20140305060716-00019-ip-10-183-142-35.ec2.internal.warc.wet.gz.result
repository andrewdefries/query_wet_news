Oracle Agrees to Buy Nimbula to Accelerate Cloud Ambitions

   By Steven D. Jones 
 Oracle Corp. (ORCL) added to its cloud-based holdings on Wednesday by agreeing to buy a Web-based software maker founded by the same people who helped develop the cloud services at Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) The financial details of Oracle's purchase of Nimbula Inc. were not disclosed, but technology analyst Charles King of Pund-IT said the purchase price was "probably under $100 million," based on Nimbula's previous fund-raising. Mountain View, Calif.-based Nimbula is developing cloud management software designed to combine the operational efficiency of a public cloud with the control and security of a private service. The deal comes 10 months after launch of the Oracle Public Cloud and is aimed at adding operational expertise and a broader product line to the Oracle product, analysts said. Nimbula was founded in 2008 by Chris Pinkham and Willem van Biljon, both of whom helped to build Amazon's cloud services. "It's cheaper for Oracle to buy expertise than develop it in house," Mr. King said. The deal is expected to close in the first half of the year. Nimbula was backed by venture investors Accel Partners and Sequoia Capital, and it had raised $20 million in funding through August of last year. An Oracle spokesman confirmed the purchase but declined comment. Nimbula issued a statement saying its technology is "complementary to Oracle and is expected to be integrated with Oracle's cloud offerings." Oracle launched its cloud last summer, embracing a software delivery strategy Chief Executive Larry Ellison once called "complete gibberish" and setting its competitive sights on Germany's SAP AG (SAP, SAP.XE) and Bay Area rival Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM). The company has said it expects to generate $1 billion in revenue from cloud services this fiscal year. Write to Steven D. Jones at steve-d.jones@dowjones.com Email

US Blacklists Ugandan Police Chiefs Over Rights Abuses

By Nicholas Bariyo KAMPALA, Uganda--The U.S. has blacklisted around a dozen Ugandan police chiefs over their role in the brutal crackdown against opposition-led street protests, in a major rift between the East African nation and one of its ardent security allies, Ugandan police officials said Tuesday. Most blacklisted police officers commanded the violent crackdown on protesters around 2011-12, when the country's veteran opposition figure, Kizza Besigye led long-running street protests that nearly toppled the regime of President Yoweri Museveni, one of Africa's longest serving leaders. The affected officers cannot travel to the U.S. or attend any U.S.-sponsored training programs, in a major setback to the country's efforts bolster its security agencies, in the wake of rising terror threats in the region. "We do not provide assistance to individuals or units where the vetting process uncovers credible information of human rights violations," a state department spokesman said. "Security cooperation is a critical foreign policy instrument that, when conducted in a manner that reflects both our values and our national security priorities, can help strengthen and solidify our bilateral relations with countries such as Uganda over the long term." A Ugandan police official Tuesday said that last month, the U.S. barred several Ugandan police officers from attending a U.S.-sponsored training course in Botswana. Patrick Onyango, Uganda's deputy police spokesman, declined to reveal the identities of the affected officers, but defended the police's human rights record. "Police officers have the duty to maintain public order, we have noted some incidents in the past but nothing has gone unpunished," Mr. Onyango said. In April 2011, Ugandan security officials used sledge hammers to break into the car of Mr. Besigye before brutally arresting him as he led protests over steep food and fuel prices. The incident sparked riots in several cities that appeared to herald an Arab spring-like uprising in Uganda. Security forces killed more than a dozen protesters as they battled to control the worst urban unrest in Mr. Museveni's nearly 30-year rule. This year, sporadic protests have continued to rock the country as public anger mounts against Mr. Museveni's regime, mainly due to worsening economic distress. Uganda is facing a widening budget deficit after several donors cut off aid last year, citing high corruption levels in government. Police officers continue to react to the protests aggressively, firing tear gas, rubber bullets and beating up demonstrators. Mr. Besigye, the ring leader of the protests has been arrested more than a dozen times since the start of the year. Last year, the government passed a tough law, which outlaws the gathering of more than three people to discuss politics without the authorization of the police. The U.S. extended nearly $50 million worth of military assistance to Uganda last year, to bankroll Ugandan-led operations against al-Qaeda affiliated al shabab militants in Somalia. Around half of the assistance funded Ugandan troops hunting down fugitive warlord Joseph Kony in the jungles of the Central African Republic. At least 100 U.S. military advisors are working alongside Ugandan troops in Central Africa. A state department spokesman said that the U.S. remains committed to the operations against Mr. Kony. Initially, credited for turning around Uganda's shattered economy, Mr. Museveni continues to face criticisms over rights abuses and attempting to rule for life. Last year, the U.S.-based Center For Strategic and International Studies said that uncertainty over who will succeed Mr. Museveni is the single main threat to the country's future stability.
