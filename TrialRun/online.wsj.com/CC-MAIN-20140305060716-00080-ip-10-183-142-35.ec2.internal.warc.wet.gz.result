Associated Press
WATERLOO, N.Y. — A judge has dismissed some minor charges against a central New York man accused of killing his son to collect $700,000 in life insurance, but he still faces a murder trial.
The Syracuse Post-Standard reports (http://bit.ly/143rEyT) the Seneca County judge in the case against 53-year-old Karl Karlsen decided a document signed by 23-year-old Levi Karlsen didn't constitute a will and threw out charges of concealing a will, perjury, making an apparently false statement and offering a false instrument for filing.
The charges were lodged in May on top of a previous indictment for second-degree murder and insurance fraud. Karlsen has pleaded not guilty.
He's accused of toppling a truck off a jack onto his son in a staged accident at their Romulus home in 2008.
Karlsen is due in court for a pretrial hearing Friday.

Air Safety Group Urged Tougher Battery Tests
By
Andy Pasztor
Updated Jan. 27, 2013 10:32 p.m. ET
Shortly after the Federal Aviation Administration issued safety rules in 2007 for using lithium-ion batteries on Boeing Co.'s 787 Dreamliner jets, an industry standards-setting group called for stricter testing to prevent battery fires on aircraft. Boeing and FAA officials decided that since design and testing of the plane was so far along, mandating the tougher standards would disrupt years of joint safety work and unfairly delay...

The most consequential ideas are often right under our noses.
Jimmy Turrell When most CEOs hear the word "innovation," they roll their eyes. It conjures up images of employees wasting hours, even days, sitting in beanbag chairs, tossing Frisbees and regurgitating ideas they had already considered. "Brainstorming" has become a byword for tedium and frustration. Over the past decade, we have asked senior executives, on every continent and in every major industry, two key questions about innovation. The first: "On a scale of one to 10, how important is innovation to the success of your firm?" The second: "On a scale of one to 10, how satisfied are you with the level of innovation in your firm?" Not surprisingly, they rate the importance of innovation very high: usually a nine or 10. None disputes that innovation is the No. 1 source of growth. Without fail, however, most senior executives give a low rating—below five—to their level of satisfaction with innovation. How could business leaders rate innovation as so important yet feel so dissatisfied with their own organizations' performance? Because what they really want to know is how: How do you actually generate novel ideas and do so consistently, on demand? The Saturday Essay How America Lost Its Way (6/8/13) A Message for the Class of 2013 (5/1/13) Battle of the Beach (5/25/13) Swearing In the Enemy (5/18/13 A Dangerous Rift Between China and Japan (5/11/13) Why I Froze My Eggs (And You Should, Too) (5/4/13) The Criminal Mind (4/27/13) The traditional view of creativity is that it is unstructured and doesn't follow rules or patterns. Would-be innovators are told to "think outside the box," "start with a problem and then brainstorm ideas for a solution," "go wild making analogies to things that have nothing to do with your product or service." We advocate a radically different approach: thinking inside the proverbial box, not outside of it. People are at their most creative when they focus on the internal aspects of a situation or problem—and when they constrain their options rather than broaden them. By defining and then closing the boundaries of a particular creative challenge, most of us can be more consistently creative—and certainly more productive than we are when playing word-association games in front of flip charts or talking about grand abstractions at a company retreat. Our method works by taking a product, concept, situation, service or process and breaking it into components or attributes. Using one of five techniques, innovators can manipulate the components to create new-to-the-world ideas that can then be put to valuable use. The five techniques are: Subtraction Remove seemingly essential elements. Consider a contact lens, an exercise bicycle, a package of powdered soup and an ATM. What do they have in common? They have all had something subtracted. Subtract the frame of a pair of glasses and you have the contact lens. Remove a bike's rear wheel and you invent the exercise bicycle. Extract water from soup to make a package of powdered soup. Take the bank employee out of a cash transaction and you have an ATM. The original Sony

Walkman was a cassette recorder that had the recording function subtracted, which seemed to defy all logic: a spinoff product that did less than the original. Even Akio Morita,
Sony's chairman and the inventor of the Walkman, was surprised by the market's enthusiastic response. Philips Electronics used subtraction to revolutionize the DVD market. Remember when a DVD player looked like a traditional, bulky VCR player, with a confusing array of buttons and displays on the front panel? The Philips team hit on the idea of removing these functions from the DVD player itself and placing them on a hand-held device. The result: a slimmer, cheaper, sleeker and easier-to-use DVD machine—and a new design standard not just for DVD players but for the whole home-electronics market.

the world's largest travel-bag company, used task unification to expand into the college backpack market. Backpacks, especially for college students, cause back and neck strain due to the weight of their contents: textbooks, laptops, beverages and so on. Instead of padding the straps like other backpacks, the Samsonite team created a way to use the heavy weight as a comfort advantage. The straps are shaped so that they press softly into the wearer's shoulders at strategically located shiatsu points to provide a soothing massage sensation. The heavier the contents, the deeper the sensation and the more stress relief for the wearer. Or consider the Captcha system, which you have probably experienced many times but without knowing its name. Captcha (an acronym for Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) is what asks you to type words written in a bizarre, distorted script inside a box before you're allowed to enter a website. Ticketmaster, for instance, uses Captcha to prevent the automated programs of scalpers from immediately scooping up the most desirable seats for events. What most people don't realize is that their Captcha answers serve two purposes—and here we get to task unification. In addition to proving to websites that they are not machines, the users of Captcha are deciphering difficult-to-read words from printed texts. The system's inventor, a Carnegie Mellon computer scientist named Luis von Ahn,
realized that by feeding into Captcha words that computer scanners can't read—especially the old fonts often found in older publications—users could help in the massive task of transforming printed content into digital form. Ordinary web surfers are helping to transcribe the equivalent of nearly 150,000 books a year. Multiplication Copy a component and then alter it. In 1804, the British scientist William Hyde
Wollaston invented the single-element concavo-convex meniscus lens, which has been used ever since in simple focus-free box cameras, including the famous Kodak
Brownie. Serious photographers need more versatility, however. So over the past century, camera makers have multiplied the basic lens and changed its shape to create an entire spectrum of lenses for different sorts of images: close up, far away, wide angle or even blurred or grossly distorted. Each works with one click of a button, but with dramatically different effects. Or consider the razor. Since the Bronze Age, men have been shaving using a single blade. Then, in 1971, Gillette introduced the TRAC II Twin Blade Shaving System, which sported two blades instead of one. Twin blades give a closer shave because each blade performs a different function. The first blade pulls up the hair so that it is unable to retract into the skin before the second blade, set at a slightly different angle, cuts it off. The TRAC II set off a still-ongoing competitive frenzy of multiplication in the shaving industry. A range of products are the obvious result of multiplication, from bifocal lenses and double-sided tape to three-way light bulbs. But multiplication works for services as well. For the College Board, which designs, administers and scores the SAT, maintaining the validity of its test is a big challenge: Colleges want an entrance exam that is consistent in what it measures from year to year. But how can the College Board gauge the difficulty of questions before students are actually scored on them? The answer: by including "experimental" questions in order to assess them for inclusion in future tests. These particular questions are not scored, but students have no way of knowing that, so they spend about 25 minutes of the 225-minute testing period answering zero-value questions. By using multiplication in this way, the College Board is able to offer a "new" test each year while ensuring that its quality matches that of previous tests. Division Separate the components of a product or service and rearrange them. Instances of this technique abound, from airline check-in procedures that now have you print your boarding pass at home to the TV remote control whose functions used to be attached to the box itself. Or consider central air-conditioning. The first air-conditioning units contained all the necessary components in a single box: thermostat, fan, cooling unit. But once the motor and fan of the cooling unit were separated from the other pieces, they could be placed somewhere else—like outside a house, thus reducing noise and heat and eliminating the need to block a window with a bulky integrated unit.

used the technique of division to completely redesign the medical-sales training program of one of its business units. It divided the course content—anatomy, surgical procedures and medical devices—into smaller chunks and then rearranged it around relevant diseases and conditions. This approach dramatically reduced the amount of time needed to train a sales representative and made it much easier to roll out training on new products to its existing sales force. Attribute dependency Make the attributes of a product change in response to changes in another attribute or in the surrounding environment. An excellent example of this technique is eyewear with transition lenses, which change from light to dark in the sunlight. So, too, are windshield wipers that speed up as it rains harder. Some instances of this technique have been around for so long that they no longer seem especially creative, but they once were. This is especially true with respect to pricing. Take, for example, loyalty programs that offer discounts to long-standing customers or discounts based on the number of friends that a customer recommends. Both work by making one variable dependent on another. But different variables apply to different products. For iced tea, seasonality has long been the decisive factor: It's a product for cooling off in summer. Beverage Partners Worldwide, a joint venture between Nestlé

wanted its Nestea brand to compete more effectively against the market-leading Lipton, so it changed that seasonal calculus. The result was the Nestea Winter Collection, a line of "iced tea" products designed to be consumed at room temperature or even heated. The new product line reversed the typical slump in winter sales by responding to that colder environment and creating a brand-new market. Using any one or all of these "inside the box" techniques involves retraining the way your brain thinks about problem solving. Most people think innovation starts with establishing a well-defined problem and then thinking of solutions. Our method is just the opposite: We take an abstract, conceptual solution and find a problem that it can solve. This approach to innovation was first described in 1992 by the psychologist Ronald Finke.
He discovered that people are actually better at searching for benefits for given configurations (starting with a solution) than at finding the best configuration for a given benefit (starting with the problem). Imagine a baby bottle and being told that it changes color as the temperature of the milk changes. Why would that be useful? Because it would help to make sure that you don't burn the baby with milk that is too hot. Now imagine you were asked the opposite question: How can we make sure not to burn a baby's mouth with milk that is too hot? How long would it take you to come up with a color-changing milk bottle? You might never arrive at the idea. The key to being consistently innovative is to create a new form for something familiar and then to find a function it can perform. That is why, when we first hear about a new idea, we often experience a sense of disappointment with ourselves: Gee, why didn't I think of that? The most consequential ideas are often right under our noses, connected in some way to our current reality or view of the world. Inventions can be extraordinary, but invention isn't an extraordinary event or an activity for a specialized group. Nor is creativity reserved for the gifted and talented. It's a skill that can be learned and mastered by anyone, if approached properly. Like so much else in life, the more it's practiced, the more skillful at it we become. Adapted from "Inside the Box: A Proven System of Creativity for Breakthrough Results," which has just been published by Simon & Schuster.

A farmer removed weeds in his field adjoining the Park Granduera project of Indian developer BPTP in Faridabad.
Sanjay Austa for The Wall Street Journal Read More Outlying Developments End Up in Dispute What is different this time around is the type of investment the firms are making. In the past, private-equity firms, hedge funds and other investors put their money in untested development companies that were building large-scale residential and office complexes for the first time. Now, they are largely investing in actual properties, rather than companies. Since the buildings are finished or under construction and presold or preleased, the returns are clearer to see. "Investors are being far more selective and far more disciplined," said Shirish Godbole,
India head of Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing. At the residential complex the firm invested in earlier this year, one third of the homes have been sold already. The new approach by foreign investors in India real estate reflects a broader trend in many emerging markets recovering from a flight of capital during the global economic crisis. Capital is beginning to return to property deals, but investors have learned from the mistakes they made during the boom years. "Investors are almost obsessed with due diligence," said David Green-Morgan,
head of capital markets research for Jones Lang LaSalle,

Sanjay Austa for The Wall Street Journal Between 2006 and 2008, private-equity and other investment firms poured nearly $15 billion into Indian real estate, primarily into companies. But many of those investments soured as developers used the money to buy land while failing to finish construction of projects on schedule. By the time many were completed, India's economy had slowed, and these properties didn't lease or sell as expected. Meanwhile, India's initial public offering market lost its luster, depriving many of the private-equity firms of the exit strategy they had expected. Often, local partners took advantage of funds by buying them out at steep discounts, said Manish Srivastava,
a professor at New York University's Schack Institute of Real Estate, who has worked as a consultant to several of the funds. Other "horror stories" included local partners who "instead of buying the land in the name of the company, took the money and bought the land in their own name," said Mr. Srivastava. He declined to identify his clients but said none of them were victims of abuses. The largest foreign investments in India real estate included Deutsche Bank AG

in 2007. The deals have shown mixed results. In February, Lodha Developers announced it would buy back its stake from Deutsche Bank for about $515 million. The return for Deutsche Bank was lower partly because the Indian rupee lost 22% of its value against the U.S. dollar during the period of the investment. Meanwhile, D.E. Shaw was repaid around $500 million by DLF in 2009, according to research firm Venture Intelligence. So far this year, private-equity and other investment firms have invested $1.1 billion in Indian real estate, compared with $8.2 billion in 2007 and $5.4 billion in 2008, according to Venture Intelligence. Out of about 35 foreign funds that invested in India between 2005 and 2007, only four or five are left, according to Mr. Srivastava. But the firms that stayed are dusting off their check books. Part of the appeal is that property values have fallen. Top-quality office buildings in Mumbai today are worth about 73% of their value in 2008, according to Jones Lang LaSalle. Real-estate investor Sam Zell's
Equity International began scoping out the India market in 2000 but didn't buy anything until last year, when it purchased SAMHI Hotels Pvt., a developer and owner of hotels. During the boom years, "we were sitting there agape," Mr. Zell said. "The pricing didn't make sense." Blackstone set up its real-estate unit in India in 2007 but made only one $18 million investment until last year. Blackstone executives say they were cautious about promises some developers were making. "People thought 100-acre townships could be built in three years," said Tuhin Parikh,
managing director of Blackstone's real-estate group in India. "On a risk-return basis, it didn't make sense," he said. Now, he believes prices have come off their highs and expectations are more realistic. "Now, you have developers who've gone through baptism by fire." Blackstone's investment in October of the portfolio of office buildings in south and west India was appealing because many buildings in two of the three office parks in the portfolio are preleased, assuring an immediate cash flow. "India's real-estate industry has reached early adulthood," Mr. Parikh said. Enlarge Image
BPTP's Park Arena is under construction in Faridabad.
Sanjay Austa for The Wall Street Journal To be sure, some foreign investors are still buying companies. Equity International's purchase of SAMHI reflects its longtime strategy of buying companies instead of properties, relying on its decades of experience at selecting local partners. Also, foreign investors in India real estate still must deal with a bureaucracy, currency risk, weak infrastructure and a creaky system of property rights. A deterioration of the global economy could once again make it difficult for investors such as Blackstone to exit their investments. But investors are structuring deals to give them more protection. For example, Kotak Realty, an India-based fund manager that raises money from both local and foreign investors, co-invests with developers into so-called special-purpose vehicles that fund construction projects. The vehicles pay the fund a debt-like return of 16% to 20% annually, as well as repayment of principal at the end of construction. Investors "are standing first in the queue to get their money," said S. Sriniwasan,
Kotak Realty's chief executive. Some foreign investors also aren't counting on the IPO market as an exit strategy. Mr. Godbole, of Morgan Stanley, points out that developing homes for sale relies on individual buyers not broad capital-market trends. "It may take one year, two years, three years, but it sells," he said. Email
