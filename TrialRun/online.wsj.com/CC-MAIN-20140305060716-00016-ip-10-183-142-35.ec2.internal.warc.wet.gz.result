Presentations can be incredibly dull, with slide after slide of too much text and mind-numbing bullet points. Short of eliminating PowerPoint altogether, how can people add spice to these things? This week, I tested Haiku Deck, a free app from Seattle-based Giant Thinkwell Inc. that has the potential to shake up the way presentations are made and shared. It works on Apple's

iPad, a device most people wouldn't instinctively reach for when creating a presentation. Haiku Deck is named after the three-line, 17-syllable, Japanese poem, and like a haiku, it intends to create something beautiful and enjoyable while staying simple. The app can make all sorts of slide shows, from committee presentations to wedding photos. Big pictures and an economy of words are the features of Haiku Deck, a new app that can help liven up typically dull office presentations. WSJ's Katherine Boehret says the app has some attractive features but is still a work in progress.
Haiku Deck makes presentations simple to create and lovely to display. Katie Boehret reports on digits.
Though the app is limited to iPads now, by the end of this year, Giant Thinkwell will introduce a Haiku Deck app for tablets running Google's

Android operating system. And this isn't the first app to introduce presentation-making on the iPad; Apple's Keynote app, for example, does this, but costs $10 and is much more complex than Haiku Deck. Simplicity rules in this app. Each slide in a Haiku Deck can have no more than two lines of text, though these lines can be arranged in various layouts. Each slide contains a single full-bleed photo associated with its text. The app offers image suggestions that might best represent keywords in the slide. Images are pulled from over 35 million photos in the legally shareable content site, Creative Commons, using a Haiku Deck algorithm that predicts what you'll want to see. If you prefer, photos can be pulled in from your iPad, or from networks like Facebook, Instagram, Flickr and Picasa. Themes are applied to slide shows in one step, simultaneously changing all slides' font styles and sizes. Themes are limited to five free ones that come with the app and 11 Premium themes that are available for $1.99 apiece. In 20 minutes, I created a slide show about Haiku Deck using the free Cinematic theme (watch it here: http://bit.ly/Q1qJtn). Enlarge Image
Photos are automatically suggested according to keywords in Haiku Deck slide shows.
Giant Thinkwell Inc. I had a blast using Haiku Deck and often did so while watching TV with my iPad on my lap. I made a few decks and I was surprised by how simple they were to put together. Friends who saw them thought I took much more time to make them, considering how professional they looked, and were surprised to hear I made them using just an iPad. I shared my work with others using a link people could click on to play the slide show with any Internet-connected device. I played them on Macs, Windows PCs, iPads, iPhones, Android phones and BlackBerrys. After creating a slide show about getting people involved in a committee that I lead, I compared it with a slide show I made using photos from a Labor Day weekend trip I took to Charlottesville, Va. Haiku Deck was really useful in the committee presentation, where I had no photos of my own to draw from. With that presentation, it prompted me to pull more abstract, clever images to illustrate my points, like a photo of an acrobat for a slide that said, "Participate in events" and an image of people diving into a lake for a slide that said, "How can you dive in?" But even when I used Haiku Deck to make a deck of my trip to Charlottesville, the app's smart suggestions of photos that might go with keywords in my slides were entertaining to look at and I used several photos from Creative Commons to supplement images I didn't have. For example, one night we wandered the University of Virginia campus, but I didn't take any photos that came out well in the dark. Haiku Deck suggested a huge list of images related to the keyword "UVA," and I typed "night" into the search box to get more specific images. After a while, I did this often to find the right photo. From the iPad app, I could email decks, share them on Facebook or Twitter or export them as PowerPoint presentations. After looking at a Haiku Deck on the Web, people can download it as a PDF; this feature will eventually also be available on the iPad app. And with a Haiku Deck account, I could make my slide show public, private or restricted, meaning only people who got the shared URL could see it. There are downsides to Haiku Deck and Giant Thinkwell is working on fixing some of them. These include adding the ability to play music with slides and extra layout and text options. It will soon add the ability to make two versions of the same slide shows using different themes. The company also plans to add presenter notes to Haiku Deck. I also noticed that in Edit mode, where the slides appear in a small tray at the bottom of the screen for easy rearrangement, I couldn't see the text on slides, which got confusing as I rearranged similar images from my trip to Charlottesville. The company said this was a design choice to keep the interface uncluttered. If you want to make a presentation that's enjoyable to look at and complemented with images you might not have, Haiku Deck is a smart app that makes beautiful slide shows in no time and makes your iPad a more productive tool. —Email katie.boehret@wsj.com Email

Obama administration officials scrambling to get the health law's insurance marketplaces ready to open on Tuesday keep hitting technical problems, while government-funded field workers across the country say they aren't fully prepared to help Americans enroll in the program. Implementation of the law is expected to proceed even if the government partially shuts down because Congress fails to pass the necessary spending bills. But insurers, who are counting on the law to usher in new customers, say that even short-lived...

The World Series of Poker, 2010.
Associated Press More than 6,300 players, each paying an entry fee of $10,000, gathered in Las Vegas early this month for the championship event of the 44th annual World Series of Poker. The tournament ran for 10 days, and just nine players now remain. They will reunite in November for a two-day live telecast to determine who wins the first prize: $8.3 million. Poker didn't get this big overnight. In 2003, a then-record 839 players entered the championship for a shot at $2.5 million. The winner was an amateur with the improbable name of Chris Moneymaker.
After ESPN devoted seven prime-time hours to his triumph, online poker took off and tournament participation ballooned, as did prize pools. The U.S. government's ban on the major online poker sites in 2011 reined in enthusiasm, but the game has continued to grow in Europe, Asia and Latin America. This growth over the past decade has been accompanied by a profound change in how the game is played. Concepts from the branch of mathematics known as game theory have inspired new ideas in poker strategy and new advice for ordinary players. Poker is still a game of reading people, but grasping the significance of their tics and twitches isn't nearly as important as being able to profile their playing styles and understand what their bets mean. In no-limit hold'em poker, the game used for the World Series championship, each player is dealt two private cards and attempts to make the best five-card hand that he can by combining his own cards with five cards that are shown faceup and shared by all players. Those cards are revealed in stages: The first three are the "flop," the fourth is the "turn," and the fifth is the "river." Players can bet any amount they like at each stage. Suppose you hold a pair of sevens, and before the flop is dealt you go all-in (bet all of your chips). One player calls your bet, and everyone else folds their hands. You both turn your cards face up, and you are happy to see your opponent show a pair of sixes. You are in great shape, since you have the better hand. But when the flop arrives, it contains a six, giving your opponent three sixes, and your own hand doesn't improve, so you lose. Was your all-in play correct? In terms of results, it wasn't, because you lost all your chips. But according to the math of hold'em, a pair of sevens is favored to beat a pair of sixes 81% of the time. So if you can go all-in with sevens and get your bet called by players holding sixes over and over again, luck should even out, and eventually you will be a big winner. Poker theorist David Sklansky
once wrote that you should consider yourself a winner as long as you had the higher probability of winning the hand when all the money went into the pot. This attitude is consistent with the underlying mathematical reality of poker, and it can smooth out your emotional reactions to losses and wins. What matters is the quality of your decisions, not the results that come from them. A few years ago, a young pro named Phil Galfond
published a crucial refinement to Mr. Sklansky's point. He showed that the right way to analyze a poker decision is to consider your opponent's "range"—that is, the full set of different hands that he could plausibly have, given all the actions that he has thus far taken. So if, for example, you believed that your opponent would only call your bet if he held sixes or a better pair, then at the moment he calls—before he turns up his cards—you should be unhappy. You want to see the sixes and be an 81% favorite, but you are much more likely to see a hand like eights, nines or higher, and against any of these your likelihood of winning is only about 19%. In fact, against this range of pairs from sixes up to aces, your "equity"—your winning chances averaged over all of those possible hands—would be just 27%. Of course, in poker, you rarely know your opponent's range precisely, nor does he know yours. In our example, if your opponent thinks you would never go all-in without at least a pair of tens, he probably won't call you with anything worse than that. So his calling range depends on what he thinks your range could be. In practice, this means that you should not make a particular play (such as an all-in bet) only when you have a superstrong hand, because this makes it easy for an observant opponent to deduce your range and fold with all but his own superstrong hands. If you sometimes make a strong play with weak hands—the ancient practice of bluffing—your opponent has a harder time narrowing your range down. This concept, known as "balancing" one's range, supplements an expert's intuition about when to bluff with logical explanations of why and how often it is the right play. Calculating equities for ranges is too complicated to do while you are playing. Today's top tournament players advise up-and-comers not to memorize formulas but to improve their feeling for ranges by playing with poker calculation apps that rapidly estimate odds by simulating thousands of hands. Why this sudden leap forward in the strategy of a game that has existed for over a century? Computer analysis has contributed, just as it has wrought changes in backgammon and chess theory. But the real cause of the advances that have accompanied the poker boom has been the boom itself. With 10 times more people seriously playing the game, the collective creativity and thinking power of the poker world has grown by at least an order of magnitude. The growth of poker theory is a perfect example of how innovation accelerates in interacting communities. Today's poker players are in a world-wide arms race to discover new ideas and refine their playing styles, led by the younger generation of more mathematically minded pros. And collective progress comes from the application of collective intelligence: Putting more minds to work on a problem makes the discovery of new and better solutions much more likely. Jason Lee 1. Each player is dealt two private cards. The goal: to make the best five-card hand using the five faceup cards shared by all players. 2. Player A gets two sevens; Player B gets two sixes. Neither player knows what the other has yet, but a pair of sevens is favored to beatapair of sixes 81% of the time. 3. After the shared cards are dealt and the players reveal their hands, Player B wins with three sixes, beating the odds.

Erica E. Phillips and Ben Kesling Updated March 8, 2013 10:40 p.m. ET
They say faith can be found in all kinds of places, even a beer bottle. For parishioners in Allendale, Mich., home-brewing parties are just another way to spread the gospel. WSJ's Ben Kesling reports.
ALLENDALE, Mich.—As several of the faithful from the Valley Church here prepared to bow their heads in prayer to open a recent Saturday-evening meeting, they introduced themselves. "My name is Darin," the Methodist congregation's 37-year-old music director said, grinning. "And I like me a 30-pack of Busch Light!" The circle broke into laughter as several people put down bottles of microbrew beer to applaud. It was a fitting introduction for the event—a semi-regular meeting of beer enthusiasts and home brewers who go by the moniker "What Would Jesus Brew?" Pastor Matt Bistayi, who started Valley Church three years ago, says the goal of WWJB isn't to be "churchy," but rather to "reach out to people in a loving, grace-filled way that meets people where they are and as they are." Valley Church is one of several congregations around the country tapping the growing craft-beer trend as a way to attract new members. The number of American adults who consider themselves "unaffiliated" with any particular religion has grown from 15% to 20% in the last five years, according to a study released last year by the Pew Research Center. Among 18-to 29-year-olds, it's roughly a third. "The hardest thing in the church, period, is reaching out to people my age," says Jake Shirreffs, a 23-year-old in black-framed glasses who plays guitar in the band at Valley Church. Enlarge Image

Anthony Falcetta Meanwhile, craft breweries have popped up all over the country and home-brewing has become increasingly popular. Membership in the American Homebrewers Association has quadrupled since 2005, according to the group's director, Gary Glass. In Wilmington, N.C, the 150-year-old St. Paul's Episcopal Church was struggling with membership a few years ago, so the community brainstormed ways to draw new members. Jeffrey Hughes, a member of St. Paul's, came up with the idea for congregants to brew beer and challenge other churches in the area to a friendly competition to raise money for charity. Mr. Hughes presented his idea for the "What Would Jesus Brew?" competition at a meeting of church elders. "It was quiet," recalls Mr. Hughes, "and then everyone started laughing." Enlarge Image
A handful of nearby churches took up the mantle, and the groups met at Wilmington's Front Street Brewery to learn basic brewing techniques and the history of beer in the church. St. Paul's team, "Brew Unto Others," also came up with a team slogan: "God's peace. Happy yeast." Mr. Hughes built a "gigantic, four-foot trophy with a giant stein on it," which went to the "Hopostles" from St. Mary Catholic Parish for their tasty double India Pale Ale. Mr. Bistayi of Valley Church, Mr. Hughes of St. Paul's and other church home-brew disciples admit their new style of evangelism has raised a few eyebrows in their sometimes teetotaling religious communities. But they are quick to testify to the long history of beer making in the church. Monks across Europe, in places like Ireland, Belgium and southern Germany, have carefully crafted renowned beers for centuries. "We're really getting back to our roots here," says the Rev. J.D. Brown of Holy Trinity Episcopal Church outside Dallas. There, the men's ministry brews a range of beers in the parish kitchen, from the "Humble Friar" oatmeal stout to the "Dubya" and "Dubya-too" wheat beers. Not everyone welcomes the marriage of church and brew. Joe Godfrey, a veteran Southern Baptist pastor who runs a policy and education group addressing "moral concerns" such as alcohol and drug abuse, says it "burdens" him to see churches supporting alcohol consumption and homebrewing. Mr. Godfrey testified recently before the Alabama State Legislature in an effort to prevent his home state from legalizing homebrewing. "Before prohibition, when saloons were running rampant," he says, "churches were the voice of reason." But Father Brown says he tells skeptics that it's all "in keeping with the monastic tradition of hospitality." Holy Trinity adds its own twist to that tradition, playing host to an Oktoberfest celebration with a roasted whole pig, a bounce house, a cake walk and, of course, a beer-tasting competition. "If you have a high concentration of young adults, I think things like this work well," says Father Patrick Gray of Christ Church in South Hamilton, Mass. "I just like to drink beer and hang out with people," says the 42-year-old. The Episcopal congregation's Home Brew Fellowship met earlier this month to craft a special batch of beer for St. Patrick's Day. Father Gray says they plan to serve the finished product at a reception following an evening service. For at least two church brewing groups, the activity has gone commercial. Hess Brewing Co. in San Diego and Monday Night Brewing in Atlanta both started as Bible study group projects. Mike Hess says the New Life Presbyterian Church group began with a dozen members and now boasts between 60 and 80 regulars with as many as 100 on occasion. That helped him "drain tanks" regularly, test out several recipes and get feedback on the flavors and styles. Hess Brewing is expanding into a new, larger location—a former Christian book store that had been owned by church members. Mr. Hess's Belgian "Trinitas" beer, named for the Holy Trinity, is now one of the brewery's mainstays. Jeff Heck, Joel Iverson and Jonathan Baker used to get together for a Friday morning Bible study through Atlanta's Westside Presbyterian Church. As a way to get to know one another better and expand their social circle, they started brewing beer in Mr. Heck's garage on Monday nights. They had success with some brews and failure with others. The Christmastime seasonal "Swaddling Ale," for example, was a bit too heavy on spruce-tree extract. For Mr. Heck, the main brewer, the process is spiritual. "Beer provides the opportunity to tap into that deeply God-given desire to create," Mr. Heck says. Back in Allendale, the malty concoction bubbled away in a pot, while Pastor Bistayi gave a 10-minute rundown on Christian beer history from St. Patrick to Arthur Guinness. In friendly company, made more so thanks to the frothy beverages in hand, his words were something just short of a sermon. "Drunkenness is a sin," he said, "but beer or alcohol in moderation can be a gift from God's creation." Write to Erica E.
