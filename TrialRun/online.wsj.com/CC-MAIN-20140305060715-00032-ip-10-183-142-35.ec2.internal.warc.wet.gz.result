Germany Summons US Ambassador Over Spying Allegations

By Harriet Torry BERLIN--Germany's foreign ministry has summoned the U.S. ambassador Thursday, a spokeswoman said, over allegations that U.S. intelligence agencies may be spying on Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone. John B. Emerson, the newly-appointed U.S. ambassador to Germany, will meet foreign minister Guido Westerwelle Thursday afternoon, according to the ministry. "The German government's position will be clearly presented to him," the ministry spokeswoman said. The U.S. embassy in Berlin referred questions back to the German foreign ministry. Germany's parliamentary control committee, which oversees the intelligence services, will meet for an impromptu session on the cellphone scandal at 1200 GMT, according to the head of the committee, Thomas Oppermann. Ms. Merkel spoke by phone with President Barack Obama on Wednesday and made clear that such surveillance among allies would be "fully unacceptable" and a "grave breach of trust," her spokesman said in a statement released late Wednesday in Berlin. The White House said Mr. Obama assured Ms. Merkel in the call that the U.S. "is not monitoring and will not monitor" her communications. "The United States greatly values our close cooperation with Germany on a broad range of shared security challenges," White House spokesman Jay Carney said.

Eric Schmidt And Ivan Seidenberg
Updated March 30, 2010 12:01 a.m. ET
Innovation in technology and business is one of America's major comparative advantages in the global information economy. That's why the Federal Communication Commission's recently released National Broadband Plan deserves attention. We believe there are at least three components of the plan that merit attention and support from policy makers and private businesses. First, the plan calls for innovating online to make advances in health-care information technology, education and job training. It also calls for working to create a smart electricity grid that can better allocate electric power to where it is needed, and create smart homes and buildings that can use electricity more efficiently than they do now. If the government enacts policies that continue to encourage market-based competition for investment and innovation, we can transform the Internet—and our lives—in all of these areas. Second, the plan focuses on increasing access to the highest-quality broadband available. That's a goal both of our companies embrace. It's why Verizon has invested tens of billions of dollars over the past five years to deploy its all-fiber broadband network, and it is why it is rolling out a new high-speed wireless broadband network that can deliver speeds far in excess of many landline networks today. It is also why Google is planning to test a one-gig-per-second broadband network that will provide up to 500,000 people in one or more U.S. communities with ultra-high-speed Internet. As the FCC's plan acknowledges, to make advanced networks broadly available and otherwise drive important changes online, we need both private investment and partnerships between governments and private companies. Third, the plan emphasizes the importance of making high-speed Internet connections available to all Americans. Even though private companies have made amazing progress connecting 70 million American homes and tens of millions of Americans on mobile broadband, many millions still remain off-line. Some don't have access to broadband. Others simply do not see its value. Connecting Americans in all parts of the country and in all walks of life can help lift society by connecting minds, stimulating ideas, and unleashing the creative potential of millions of Americans. That's good for the economy. And that's good for American communities. One reason why there is a large middle class in America is that people in this country have the freedom to develop their full potential. The Internet helps them do that, and that is why the FCC's focus on increasing access to broadband is especially important. The Internet has thrived in an environment of minimal regulation. While our two companies don't agree on every issue, we do agree generally as a matter of policy that the framework of minimal government involvement should continue. The FCC underscores the importance of creating the right climate for private investment and market-driven innovation to advance broadband. That's the right approach and why we are encouraged to see the FCC's plan. Mr. Schmidt is CEO of Google. Mr. Seidenberg is CEO of Verizon. Email

CAIRO—Hosni Mubarak was released from prison to house arrest on Thursday, Egyptian media showing images of the 85-year-old former autocrat smiling as he was wheeled on a gurney from a helicopter after his airlift from the penitentiary. News of his release caused barely a ripple of reaction from a country still reeling in the violent struggle for power in the wake of his nearly 30-year rule. Mr. Mubarak was transferred to a...

Building a complex human organ in the lab is no longer a dream of science fiction. At London's Royal Free Hospital, a team of 30 scientists is manufacturing a variety of body parts, including windpipes, noses and ears. WSJ's Gautam Naik reports. Photo: Gareth Phillips
MADRID—Reaching into a stainless steel tray, Francisco Fernandez-Aviles
lifted up a gray, rubbery mass the size of a fat fist. It was a human cadaver heart that had been bathed in industrial detergents until its original cells had been washed away and all that was left was what scientists call the scaffold. Next, said Dr. Aviles, "We need to make the heart come alive." Inside a warren of rooms buried in the basement of Gregorio Marañón
hospital here, Dr. Aviles and his team are at the sharpest edge of the bioengineering revolution that has turned the science-fiction dream of building replacement parts for the human body into a reality. Since a laboratory in North Carolina made a bladder in 1996, scientists have built increasingly more complex organs. There have been five windpipe replacements so far. A London researcher, Alex Seifalian,
has transplanted lab-grown tear ducts and an artery into patients. He has made an artificial nose he expects to transplant later this year in a man who lost his nose to skin cancer. A History of Lab-Made Body Parts See some milestones on the road to lab-made organs.

"The work has been extraordinarily pioneering," said Sir Roy Calne,
an 82-year-old British surgeon who figured out in the 1950s how to use drugs to prevent the body from rejecting transplanted organs. Now, with the quest to build a heart, researchers are tackling the most complex organ yet. The payoff could be huge, both medically and financially, because so many people around the world are afflicted with heart disease. Researchers see a multi-billion-dollar market developing for heart parts that could repair diseased hearts and clogged arteries. In additional to the artificial nose, Dr. Seifalian is making cardiovascular body parts. He sees a time when scientists would grow the structures needed for artery bypass procedures instead of taking a vein from another part the body. As part of a clinical trial, Dr. Seifalian plans to transplant a bioengineered coronary artery into a person later this year. His employer, University College London, has designated a person to oversee any future commercialization of it and other man-made organs. More Q&A: Growing a Human Heart The development of lab-built body parts is being spurred by a shortage of organ donors amid rising demand for transplants. Also, unlike patients getting transplants, recipients of lab-built organs won't have to take powerful anti-rejection drugs for the rest of their lives. That's because the bioengineered organs are built with the patients' own cells. Until the late 1980s, few scientists believed it would be possible to make human organs because it was a struggle to grow human cells in the laboratory. The task became easier once scientists figured out the chemicals—known as growth factors—that the body itself uses to promote cellular growth. Scientists started out growing simple organs. In 1999, Anthony Atala, director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., implanted lab-grown bladders into the first of several children with severely dysfunctional bladders. The organs have continued to function well for several years. Dr. Atala's team now is trying to grow a whole range of bioengineered parts, from simple blood vessels to human livers. "You can see the acceleration in the field," Dr. Atala said. View Graphics
Some of the most complex work is under way at Dr. Seifalian's laboratory at the Royal Free Hospital in London. A 56-year-old native of Iran, Dr. Seifalian started out as a nuclear physicist, and became interested in medical uses of nuclear technology. That ultimately led him to bioengineering. In 2011, Dr. Seifalian made a windpipe from a patient's cells. It was used to replace the cancerous windpipe of the patient, saving his life, his surgeon has said. Dr. Seifalian and 30 scientists now seek to build a larynx, ears, noses, urethras and bile ducts. On a recent tour, Dr. Seifalian stopped by a rotating machine that periodically shook a jar filled with a pink liquid. Inside was a human nose. A sign on the machine warned: "Nose scaffold for clinical use. Do Not Touch. Thank you, Lola." (Lola is a research assistant.) Most human organs get their form from an internal scaffolding of collagen and other proteins. Scientists struggled for years to find a replacement material that was strong and flexible and yet wouldn't be rejected by the body. Francisco Fernandez-Aviles with a human heart that is devoid of its cells.
Gautam Naik/The Wall Street Journal Eventually, they homed in on a couple of high-tech materials made from plant fibers, resins and other substances. Dr. Seifalian said he uses a material that is modeled on the honeycomb structure of a butterfly's wing. The material, a so-called nanocomposite, is resistant to infectious bacteria and has pores that are the right size to hold cells. "The material has to be accepted by the body, but it also has to be easy to manipulate into different shapes, different strengths," said Dr. Seifalian. The nose in the jar was closely modeled on the nose of a 53-year-old Briton. With the help of imaging scans and a glass mold designed by an artist, researchers first fabricated a replica of the original nose. The patient was asked if he wanted a slight deviation in his septum to be straightened out, but he turned down the offer, according to Dr. Seifalian. University College London declined to make the patient available for an interview. The researchers poured the material into the artist's mold. They added salt and sugar. That created holes in the material and gave it a spongy, porous feel, just like the real thing. The key to all the lab-built organs are stem cells, found in human bone marrow, fat and elsewhere. Stem cells can be transformed into other tissues of the body, making them the basic building blocks for any organ. In the case of the nose, stem cells extracted from the patient's fat tissue were added to the artist's mold, along with chemicals that control cell development. The stem cells sat inside the pores of the lab-made organ and gradually differentiated into cells that make cartilage. However, the nose was missing a crucial piece: skin. This posed a substantial hurdle. No one has made natural human skin from scratch. Dr. Seifalian's idea: to implant the nose under the skin of the patient's forehead in the hope that skin tissue there would automatically sheath the nose. Lab-made ears lie in jars at the Royal Free Hospital in London. Gareth Phillips for The Wall Street Journal But the patient objected, and for good reason: The implanted nose would have to sit inside his forehead for weeks or even months. In the end, Dr. Seifalian chose a less obtrusive approach. The bioengineered nose was implanted under the patient's forearm. The team now is using imaging equipment to keep tabs on whether the necessary blood vessels, skin and cartilage are forming in the right way. "We'll have to also make sure there's no infection," Dr. Seifalian said in late November, on the day of the patient's surgery. If the skin graft works, surgeons will remove the nose from the arm and attach it to the patient's face. Dr. Seifalian will then apply the right chemicals to convert the man's stem cells into epithelial cells, a common type of tissue found in the nose and in the lining of other organs. The epithelial cells will be inserted into the nose. As a final step, surgeons will connect blood vessels from the face to the site of the new nose to provide a steady flow of nourishment for the growing cells. "The whole process could take six months," said Dr. Seifalian. He estimates the cost of making the nose in the lab is about $40,000, but the patient isn't being charged because the doctors and scientists are either donating their time or working on this as part of their research. Dr. Seifalian said the new nose could restore some sense of smell to the patient, but its main benefit will be cosmetic. He held up a jar full of early-stage lab-made noses, and another filled with early-stage ears. A lab-made trachea from an earlier experiment.
Gareth Phillips for The Wall Street Journal "We're actually in the process of making a synthetic face," he said. From a cosmetic point of view, "if you can make the ear and the nose, there's not much left." Regenerating a nose would be a striking achievement; creating a complex organ like the heart would be historic. A team led by Spain's Dr. Aviles is trying to get there first. Dr. Aviles trained as a cardiologist but became frustrated with the difficulty of treating patients with advanced heart disease. The only option for the worst cases was a heart transplant, and there was a shortage of hearts. Spain has the highest donor rate in the world, yet Dr. Aviles said that only about 10% of patients who need a heart transplant get one. He was approached in 2009 by a U.S. scientist, Doris Taylor,
who had already grown a beating rat heart in the lab while at the University of Minnesota. Instead of using a man-made scaffold, Dr. Taylor had used the scaffolding from an actual rat heart as the starting point. She believed the same technique was crucial for making a working human heart. She was attracted to Spain because the higher donor rate meant that more hearts unsuitable for transplant could be used for experiments. Dr. Aviles and about 10 colleagues began their human-heart experiments crammed into a small storage room at the hospital. In 2010, a sparkling new lab opened. It has two large freezers with human cells and human hearts, and a dozen stainless steel sinks containing pig hearts immersed in a colorless liquid. Growing a heart is much harder than, say, growing a windpipe, because the heart is so big and has several types of cells, including those that beat, those that form blood vessels, and those that help conduct electrical signals. For a long time, scientists didn't know how to make all the cells grow in the right place and in the right order. The problem had been cracked by Dr. Taylor. She said that when human stem cells were put into a heart scaffold in 2010, they seemed to know just where to go. "They organized themselves in a way I didn't believe," said Dr. Taylor, who now works at the Texas Heart Institute but makes regular visits to Madrid to help with the experiments. "It's amazing that the [scaffold] can be as instructional as it is. Maybe we don't need to micromanage every aspect of this." A person's heart grows in the womb where its cells receive the right mixtures of oxygen and nutrients and chemicals to grow into a working organ. To duplicate that process in a laboratory, scientists uses a device called a bioreactor, which has various tubes ferrying materials to the heart and whisking away waste products. The lab's bioreactor—a cylindrical device nearly a foot in diameter—is being designed by Harvard Bioscience Inc.,

a maker of medical devices in Holliston, Mass. The machine will be ready for experiments in April, according to Dr. Aviles. Mimicking the heart isn't easy. For example, more than a gallon of blood courses through the human heart each minute. The bioreactor will have to be set up so that a similar volume is pumped through it, but gently—to avoid killing the cells. In addition, the heart cells must be given the right electrical connections. To model these connections, the Spanish team built a vest with 70 electrical points. Team members wore the vest, which record their hearts' electrical activity. That pattern of signals will have to be replicated for the lab-made heart. When Dr. Taylor built a rat heart in a lab dish five years ago, she used a pacemaker to make it beat. "Electrical activity doesn't spontaneously emerge," said Dr. Aviles. "We'll use a pacemaker, too." Dr. Aviles said he hopes to have a working, lab-made version ready in five or six years, but the regulatory and safety hurdles for putting such an organ in a patient will be high. The most realistic scenario, he said, is that "in about 10 years" his lab will be transplanting heart parts. He and his team already have grown early-stage valves and patches that could be used some day to repair tissue damaged by heart attack. The Madrid lab has made only baby steps toward its grand plan to grow a human heart using the same techniques that Dr. Taylor pioneered with a rat heart. "We opened the door and showed it was possible," she said. "This is no longer science-fiction. It's becoming science." Write to Gautam Naik at gautam.naik@wsj.com Email

The owner, Kai Hielscher, 45, purchased this property in Chicago for roughly $1.5 million in 2003, according to public records. The building was once used as a public bathhouse, according to John Russick, director of curatorial affairs at the Chicago History Museum. It was converted to a residence in the 1980s by a previous owner, Mr. Hielscher says. VHT Studios

Inside, the 9,740-square-foot home features 18-foot ceilings, according to the listing agent's office. Mr. Hielscher calls the living room area 'the basketball stadium space,' because of its large dimensions. The bathhouse was constructed around the turn of the 20th century, Mr. Russick said, and mainly served residents without bathing facilities in their homes. It was used as a bathhouse until at least the mid 1960s, he said. VHT Studios

The main level is currently being leased to a small design branding company as office space. Its lease expires in March 2014, at which point the company may renegotiate another lease, or potentially relocate, said listing agent Robert John Anderson. Shown here is a view of the main living space from around 2011, according to the listing agent. The property could be used as a residence again in the future. VHT Studios

The home has an 'almost a museum-like feel,' says Dan Chung, president of Vessel Ideation, the design branding studio currently leasing the space. He says his firm was attracted to the building as office space because of its loft-like, open floor plan. Shown is a photo of the living room as it currently looks. Vessel Ideation

The home's kitchen includes an 'immense' skylight, the listing agent says, as well a dual-sided fireplace. The other side of the fireplace opens to the living room. Mr. Hielscher is a business consultant at major accounting firm, where he works on tax and corporate structuring. He is selling the property because he has been living abroad for work since the end of 2007. VHT Studios

Philip Pangalos And Alkman Granitsas December 20, 2012
ATHENS—If it's Monday in Athens, it must be radio technicians and pension-fund employees. On Tuesday, it's lawyers and pharmacists. Strikes, work slowdowns and protest marches have become so common in crisis-hit Greece that it can be hard to keep track of who is demonstrating when, where and against what. Who's On Strike Today?
View Slideshow
Steelworkers demonstrated outside the Labor Ministry in Athens on July 23, just days after police broke up a nine-month strike against steelmaker Hellenic Halyvourgia.
Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty Images In November alone, there were labor actions by, among others, taxi and bus drivers, subway, train, tram and power-company workers, bank tellers, teachers, journalists, doctors and nurses, judges and prosecutors, engineers and garbage men. "Every morning when you wake up, you check the weather, you switch on the news and you see what strikes are happening that day," said Yannis Ifantis,
a 42-year-old travel agent in the capital. "It's one of the absurdities of life in Greece." Navigating the chaos caused by the stoppages has become a central fact of life for Athenians, who face longer commutes and myriad other disruptions to their daily routines—from restrictions on where they can shop to whether their airline will be flying. Around the city's central Syntagma Square, a main protest venue near Parliament, hotels, department stores, restaurants and shops are accustomed to closing abruptly in the middle of the day and pulling metal shutters down over their doors and windows until demonstrators leave. On Wednesday, hundreds of strikers blocked traffic for a while at one end of the square, holding up a makeshift clothesline with underwear hanging on it. Writing said: "Take these as well," a complaint about austerity measures that they feel have already stripped them of everything else. Frustrated by the nonstop dislocations, Antonis Gouzias,
a 32-year-old computer programmer, his sister, Athina, and a few friends started a website that publishes detailed daily strike schedules to help people plan their lives. "We were fed up with trawling through other websites and newspapers to find out who was on strike and how we could get to work," Mr. Gouzias said. Enlarge Image
A cyclist wheels his bike through a subway pass at the closed Doukisis Plakentias metro station during a 24-hour strike in Athens in January.
Bloomberg News These days, their site, apergia.gr (the name means strike), averages about 30,000 hits a day, Ms. Gouzias said. Traffic peaks when there are transit disruptions, she said. The one-day record is 230,000. Over the past three months, they have had three million unique visitors—in a country with 10.8 million residents. Mr. Ifantis, the travel agent, said he frequently consults the apergia site to plot his journey from home in the northern suburbs to his office in the downtown neighborhood of Pangrati. Normally, the trip takes an hour. On strike days, the travel time often doubles. Usually he takes a bus. When the buses are on strike, he takes a subway and then has to hoof it about two miles to get to work. When the train isn't running either, he tries to catch a ride into town with a neighbor through the strike-snarled traffic. Most demonstrations are much smaller—and peaceful—though still troublesome. Some border on the surreal. A sit-in by civil servants in the northeastern city of Thessaloniki has kept the government there from collecting €2 million ($2.6 million), in badly needed fees, according to the mayor, Yiannis Boutaris.

Not in Session: A strike emptied a courthouse in September.
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images The Greek finance ministry this year has had to extend the deadline for filing personal income-tax returns three times, in part because of strikes by tax collectors. Infant formula is almost impossible to get when druggists—the only retailers allowed to sell it—shut down. Parliamentary clerks even walked off the job in November during a critical vote on new austerity measures. Lawmakers caved in to their demands after less than 10 minutes, moving to exempt them from pay and pension cuts imposed on other government workers. When journalists walk off the job, TV viewers mostly get recycled entertainment shows instead. One big station reruns old newscasts, giving bleary-eyed, early-morning watchers an odd sense of déjà vu. "The frequent strikes make our lives hell," said Panagiotis Kostopoulos,
38, a sales agent. And strike-day traffic, which can double his commuting time to four hours a day, isn't the worst part of it, the father of two said. "My wife, who also works in the private sector, has lost nine days' pay in the past year because she had to stay home with the children when the teachers went on strike" and public schools closed, Mr. Kostopoulos said. Even the holidays aren't providing much respite this year. In mid-December, farmers started using their tractors to block highways in protest against a new tax law. And performances of "The Nutcracker" ballet and "Little Red Riding Hood" at Greece's national opera were canceled this month after technical and support staff declared an impromptu three-day walkout. —Nektaria Stamouli contributed to this article. Write to Philip Pangalos at philip.pangalos@dowjones.com and Alkman Granitsas at alkman.granitsas@dowjones.com Corrections & Amplifications Greece has 10.8 million residents, according to a preliminary estimate from a May 2011 census. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Greece has 10 million residents. Email

Updated Feb. 12, 2013 12:01 a.m. ET
Per the Constitution, a President appoints cabinet members "by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate." In the matter of Chuck Hagel's move to the Pentagon, the Senate's Democratic majority is more or less waiving this clause and rolling over to President Obama's wishes. It's not that Democrats don't have serious doubts about the former Republican Senator's record and qualifications. Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin started last month's nomination hearing by enumerating them, from Mr. Hagel's long-standing opposition to sanctions on Iran to his warnings about the influence of a "Jewish lobby." Enlarge Image
Sen. Chuck Hagel
Associated Press The hearing itself was a debacle without recent precedent. Obama senior campaign aide Robert Gibbs called the nominee "unimpressive and unprepared." Under the headline "Whose Terrible Idea Was It to Nominate Hagel, Anyway?", a normally pliant Obama loyalist at New York magazine blamed this "fiasco" on a "small cadre of intellectuals eager to shift the foreign-policy debate in general, and the Democratic Party's foreign-policy thinking in particular, to the left." None of this seems to sway Senate Democrats. After the President nominated Mr. Hagel, Chuck Schumer—who calls himself the Senate's "guardian of Israel"—raised what he called "genuine concerns." Within days and before the hearing, Mr. Schumer emerged from a meeting with Mr. Hagel to declare himself unconcerned and a yes vote. After the hearing, Missouri's Claire McCaskill offered this excuse: "Chuck Hagel is much more comfortable asking questions than answering them. That's one bad habit you get into when you've been in the Senate—you can dish it out but sometimes it's a little more difficult to take it." Now, there's an endorsement for someone taking a job to command generals. The last-ditch rationalization is that a President deserves the advisers he picks. "Well, this is President Obama's choice," said Maryland's Ben Cardin. "It's not who I would prefer to see as secretary of defense." That isn't what Senators Joe Biden or John Kerry said when they filibustered John Bolton's nomination to be Ambassador to the U.N. in 2005. Republicans are so far signaling that they won't filibuster Mr. Hagel, which speaks well of their confirmation consistency even with a Democrat in the White House. But Senators of either party still owe voters their independent judgment on an up or down vote. Advice and consent isn't supposed to mean partisan deference to the White House, especially when a nominee looks as unprepared as Mr. Hagel does. It's clear that Mr. Obama chose Mr. Hagel not because he wants a strong and knowledgeable adviser but because he wants a cipher who will take orders from the White House. Mr. Hagel all but admitted this at last month's hearing when West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin noted that "you're going to be basically following policy, not making policy." Mr. Hagel replied, "I won't be in a policy-making position." So at a time of global turmoil and growing White House pressure to gut defense, the Pentagon gets a potted plant. Imagine Don Rumsfeld or Henry Kissinger declaring that they took a policy job in which they could not make policy. Mr. Hagel is unlikely to be an effective public spokesman and he lacks the knowledge to wrestle intelligently with the Pentagon's many competing interests. Americans deserve better than a secretary of defense who merely takes orders from political aides like Valerie Jarrett. Senate Democrats should understand that in voting to confirm Mr. Hagel despite their misgivings and despite his clear lack of qualifications, they'll share the responsibility if his tenure becomes embarrassing.
