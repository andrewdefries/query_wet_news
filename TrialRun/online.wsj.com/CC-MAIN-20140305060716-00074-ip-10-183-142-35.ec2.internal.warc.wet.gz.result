Biography
Updated Oct. 7, 2013 7:24 p.m. ET
President Barack Obama has said that the federal debt ceiling should be increased before negotiations begin on spending cuts.
European Pressphoto Agency WASHINGTON—Senate Democrats this week are planning a vote to extend the nation's borrowing authority through 2014, the latest sign that the focus of the budget impasse is shifting toward preventing a U.S. debt default. Democrats are still debating their opening bid, but the most likely scenario is to advance a debt-limit bill free of extraneous policy amendments, as President Barack Obama
has demanded. The bill would put the need for the next debt-limit increase after next year's midterm elections. House Republicans say they won't pass any such debt-limit extension unless it is accompanied by deficit-reduction measures or other priorities. Budget Battle China Urges U.S. to Avoid Default Lew to Testify Thursday as Debt Ceiling Looms Heard: U.S. Won't Just Bump Head on Ceiling The Treasury says the debt ceiling must be raised this month, or else it wouldn't be able to pay all the country's bills. With that prospect approaching, the standoff over increasing the country's borrowing limit has merged with a related impasse over terms for funding the government, so that it can fully reopen. On Monday, White House officials said they were willing to accept a short-term measure to extend the ceiling, possibly for a few weeks, to allow lawmakers to work out a longer-term resolution. But they said that wasn't their preferred course. "It is the responsibility of Congress to decide how long and how often they want to vote," White House adviser Gene Sperling said Monday at a breakfast organized by Politico. "The important thing is that they not threaten default." Related Video

A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner
(R., Ohio) said that if the White House was open to a short-term increase in the debt ceiling "with accompanying spending cuts and reforms, that is a positive sign." Mr. Obama has said the debt ceiling should be increased before negotiations begin on spending cuts. House Republican leaders had said in recent weeks that they would pass their own legislation aimed at extending the borrowing authority for one year, which would include GOP priorities such as finishing construction on the Keystone XL pipeline and changes to the new federal health law. But they so far haven't brought a bill to the floor. The debt discussion played out on the seventh day that the government was partially shut down, as Congress failed to pass a measure funding federal agencies for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Mr. Obama called on Mr. Boehner to allow a House vote on legislation to fund the government that excludes policy riders or attempts to curtail the health law. Mr. Boehner said there aren't enough votes in the House to pass such a bill, but Democrats argue that there are. "If Republicans and Speaker Boehner are saying there are not enough votes, they should prove it," Mr. Obama said in remarks at the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Monday. "Let the bill go to the floor, and let's see what happens." Mr. Boehner said the president should negotiate with GOP lawmakers. "It's time to have that conversation before our economy is put further at risk," he said. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew is making a trip to Capitol Hill on Thursday to answer questions about the debt ceiling in front of the Senate Finance Committee, giving Republicans a chance to press him for potential areas of compromise. Senate Democrats would need 60 votes to advance any debt-ceiling plan if Republicans decide to filibuster. Democratic aides expressed confidence that all 54 Democrats and allied senators would support the bill being considered, but one aide said it might be hard to persuade Republicans to cross party lines until the prospect of the U.S. reneging on some of its obligations is closer. Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) said he was on the fence about the proposal and wanted to see what else Democrats were offering up. "The markets will not stand for default," Mr. McCain said. "I want it done." The debt ceiling could resonate in next year's elections. Senate Republicans plan to blast Democrats who support any bill raising the debt ceiling that lacks offsetting measures to trim deficits. Senate Democrats plan to attack Republicans for pressing their fight to delay or alter the health law to the point where the government has been partially shuttered and the debt-ceiling deadline has drawn near. —Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.

A New York state judge has ruled that Bianca Jagger
must pay $708,600 in back rent and other fees to the landlords of a Park Avenue building after she lost her fight to keep the rent-regulated apartment. The ruling last week follows a 2008 decision by the state appeals court, which said that the 65-year-old former wife of the Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger could be evicted from her two-bedroom apartment. The court said she wasn't eligible to stay in the rent-stabilized unit. Enlarge Image

Getty Images While Ms. Jagger had lived in the apartment at 530 Park Ave. for about 20 years, the court decided that she wasn't eligible to remain because the apartment wasn't her primary residence. Ms. Jagger, a Nicaraguan-born British citizen, also maintained a London apartment and was in the U.S. on a tourist visa. In the latest ruling, the judge ordered her to pay $246,468 for the "fair market use and occupancy" of the apartment. She was also ordered to pay $343,827 in attorney fees for the landlords, Katz Park Avenue Corp. and Diamond 530 Park Avenue Owner LLC. The remaining amount was interest payments. Dan Bryson,
an attorney for Ms. Jagger, said she will appeal the decision. He added that a personal-injury lawsuit she filed in New York Supreme Court against the prior owner of the building continues. Ms. Jagger alleged that water damage in her apartment brought harmful levels of mold. "She had always faithfully paid her rent for many years," Mr. Bryson said. "It was only after she complained about the conditions of the apartment that the landlord started eviction procedures." Landlords citywide maintain that many wealthy people abuse New York's rent-regulation system. "It didn't help when someone can financially afford an apartment and is using it for business purposes or as a pied-à-terre," says Jeffrey Goldman,
a landlord attorney in the Jagger case.

Five people died as a result of looting that accompanied demonstrations demanding changes to the constitution in Morocco, the country's interior minister said Monday, as the thousand year old North African monarchy became the latest government subject to demands for greater democracy that are sweeping the region. The protests attracted 37,000 people around the country Sunday and were generally peaceful, Interior Minister M. Taieb Cherqaoui said at a press conference. He said looters had damaged more than 100 buildings, including a bank in the port town of Al Hoceima, where five people died in a fire. He also said 128 people were wounded, mostly police. It wasn't possible to verify those figures independently Monday. Several thousand people rallied in Moroccan cities on Sunday demanding political reform and limits on the powers of King Mohammed VI, the latest protests demanding change that have rocked the region. Video courtesy of AFP.
In Rabat, the capital, a crowd of as many as 10,000 people marched through the streets Sunday chanting: "Down with autocracy" and "The people want to change the constitution," as well as slogans against the government, corruption and state television. Smaller crowds also gathered in Casablanca, the nation's business center. Video clips uploaded to Youtube overnight showed what purported to be protesters in Tangier, Fes, Marrakesh and other cities. A clip from Al Hoceima, a port in northern Morocco, showed a building gutted by fire and young men milling around among broken glass from the blown-out windows. A clip from Sefrou, near Tangier, showed a group of police severely beating one protester with clubs. Morocco is one of the last of the so-called Maghreb countries of Northern Africa where protesters have taken to the streets in the wake of the fall of Tunisia's president this year, and many analysts had predicted it would prove an exception.

European Pressphoto Agency Indeed, as protests began Sunday, there was virtually no visible uniformed police presence in Rabat. By 4 p.m., there was no sign of the state violence witnessed in Egypt, Libya, Bahrain or Iran, and the crowd had dwindled to around 1,000. Stores were largely unshuttered and cafés open along the protesters' route toward the parliament, as patrons watched from their sidewalk tables sipping café au lait in the partly Francophone capital. Yet Sunday's demonstrations, triggered as in Egypt by a Facebook campaign, underscore the potential for political tension. Morocco has seen some steps toward democracy over the past decade, including two elections that international observers declared largely free and fair, but most powers remain with the king and his appointees. A crowd that included Islamists, leftists carrying Che Guevara banners and the apolitical uniformly stopped short of calling for the removal of King Mohammed VI. The king, who took the throne in 1999 and dramatically improved Morocco's once notorious record on torture, as well as on women's rights and some other areas, is widely popular. There were similar protests Sunday in Casablanca, Morocco's much larger business center. Enlarge Image
Protesters march during a protest and wave the Moroccan flag in Rabat, Morocco Sunday Feb. 20, 2011. At least 2,000 people are marching in Morocco's capital to demand a new constitution that would bring greater democracy in the North African kingdom.
Associated Press But as elsewhere in the Middle East and the Maghreb, a younger generation is demanding systemic change. If granted, it would transform the distribution of power in this nation of 32 million, stripping influence from what a U.S. diplomat described as Morocco's "monarchical autocracy" in a 2008 U.S. State Department cable published by WikiLeaks. "People don't take part in elections in Morocco, they are meaningless. We want a monarchy, but like in Spain or England," said Aharahi Fawzi, a 30-year-old IT specialist with a university degree, who has been unemployed for three years—a common complaint in Morocco. Spain and England both have largely ceremonial monarchs who have limited powers. Bystanders, generally older, looked on with disapproval. "This king works for the people. He has done a lot for the poor," said a 67-year-old who said he was a landscape artist and gave his name only as Mohammed. "I don't know what these young people want, we who are older have seen a lot." Protest organizers put out a video to promote the demonstrations, in which a group of young people, one after the other, say in a single sentence why they want to take part. The reasons include "so that I can get a job without bribing," and "so we can hold accountable those who ruined this country." The government's main spokesman had said it looked on the prospect of demonstrations with "serenity." Protests in Morocco are relatively common. But the government appears to have been rattled. Several government ministers sought to taint protest leaders as foreign agents, homosexuals or other claims in public comments; Twitter campaigns sprang up apparently spontaneously to persuade young people not to attend; and an online rumor was spread that the protests had been canceled. Protest organizers put out a second video to counter that rumor. Many diplomats and analysts, as well as ratings agencies, have predicted that Morocco would prove the least susceptible country in the region to unrest, a prediction still supported by Sunday's light police presence. They cited the comparative tolerance of a regime where thousands of nonprofit organizations operate freely, and where there have been relatively free elections over the past decade. "This just isn't the same country as 10-15 years ago," said Robert M. Holley, a retired U.S. diplomat and executive director of the American Moroccan Center for Policy, a lobby in Washington, D.C. "The point is that if people want to change the government in Morocco, they just have to wait a couple of years until elections and do it." Morocco scores the highest of all countries in the region on Freedom House's indexes of political representation and civil liberties. At the same time it scores among the lowest on economic indicators, ranking 114th in the 2010 United Nations Human Development Report, compared with Egypt at 101st, and Bahrain at 39th. Morocco's gross national income per capita of $2,770 and literacy rate 56%, according to World Bank data, are particularly low. Libya, Iran, Jordan and Bahrain have GNI per capita ranging from $4,000 to $25,000, and all have literacy rates above 80%. There is growing frustration at the slow, and some say slowing, pace of political reform in Morocco. Though parliaments are elected, the king appoints the prime minister, as well as the ministers of justice, foreign affairs, defense, interior and religious affairs, as well as all regional governors. He also has the right to block laws. As a result, election turnouts have fallen steadily, dropping to 37% at the 2007 parliamentary elections, from 58% 10 years earlier. Similarly the PJD, an Islamist party that chose to participate in the democratic process and didn't take part in Sunday's demonstrations, has lost support to the harder-line Justice & Charity movement. "People in the U.S. and Europe always say Morocco is free. But if you look here, it isn't true. We want real elections where the people get to choose what they want," said Nabil, a 24-year-old protester and supporter of Justice & Charity, who declined to give his surname. He said he feared reprisal.

Ahead of the Tape
Election Likely to Leave Housing Unmoved
By
David Reilly
Updated Nov. 5, 2012 7:25 p.m. ET
Don't fix what isn't broken. Whatever the outcome of Tuesday's elections, that is likely to be one view of the housing market, especially given its nascent rebound. Home prices continue to rise, as shown by the latest S&P/Case-Shiller data; sales activity is strengthening, while delinquency trends improve. That argues against attempts at a housing-market overhaul for fear of sending activity, and prices, into a tailspin. Plus,...

U.K. Banks Face Interest-Rate Hedge Payout
By
Max Colchester And Margot Patrick Updated Jan. 31, 2013 11:07 a.m. ET
LONDON—The U.K.'s four largest banks may have to pay compensation to thousands of small businesses who were sold interest rate-hedging products that they didn't need or understand after a review by regulators uncovered "significant" misselling. The Financial Services Authority said Thursday that it had reviewed a sample batch of 173 hedging products sold to small businesses and concluded that 90% "did not comply with...

By

Uncertain Signs for French Economy
Industrial Production Drops Unexpectedly By
William Horobin
Aug. 9, 2013 8:22 a.m. ET
PARIS—French industrial production dropped sharply and unexpectedly in June, a development that suggests the euro zone's second-largest member will experience a slower recovery than either Germany or the U.K. Industrial production fell 1.4% in June from May, while economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires had expected a 0.1% rise in industrial output in June. The drop in industrial production in June followed a 0.3% contraction in...

Agence France-Presse/Getty Images The fast-food giant, whose restaurant sales in the U.S. began to slip last year, is pushing franchisees to improve staffing and service amid mounting complaints about rude employees. McDonald's is battling back from recent earnings disappointments, is putting unusual emphasis on a longtime challenge: getting its far-flung workforce to provide service with a smile. Joe Barrett reports. Photo: Getty Images.
In a webcast McDonald's executives held with franchise owners last month, the company said 1 in 5 customer complaints are related to friendliness issues "and it's increasing," according to a slide from the presentation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The webcast identified the top complaint as "rude or unprofessional employees." Vote and comment
One slide said that complaints about speed of service "have increased significantly over the past six months." Another mentioned that customers find service "chaotic." "Service is broken," said a slide from part of the webcast delivered by Steve Levigne,
vice president of business research for McDonald's USA. More How The New Ordering System Works Yum's Sales Slump in China Related Video
Brand reputations are among the most prized assets major corporations have but brands can fall as fast and as hard as they have climbed. MarketWatch's Rex Crum discusses U.S. companies that had to learn that the hard way. (Photo: Getty Images)
One franchisee said McDonald's has renewed emphasis on customer service since Chief Executive Don Thompson
installed Jeff Stratton,
the chain's global chief restaurant officer, as president of McDonald's USA in November, after two consecutive quarters in which the company missed Wall Street's earnings expectations. "The new leadership has decided to focus on customer satisfaction as a real driver for us to build the brand and build sales," this franchisee said, adding that the company had been gaining market share for years. "So for us to maximize the potential that's out there, we've got to be the leader in guest satisfaction," the franchisee said. A McDonald's spokeswoman wouldn't comment on the webcast or on what the company is doing to address complaints, and declined to make executives available for interviews, citing a quiet period ahead of the company's earnings on April 19.

The chain is rolling out a new ordering system in the U.S. Hulton Archive/Getty Images But she said the company continually evaluates its performance "through restaurant inspections [and] customer and employee feedback," and that "McDonald's USA and our franchisees are absolutely committed to doing even more to consistently deliver a great restaurant experience for every customer at every visit." McDonald's, which has more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants, performed well throughout most of the economic downturn by sticking to its strategy of remodeling and tidying up restaurants and rolling out a steady stream of new menu items at a range of prices—from inexpensive snack wraps to more costly fruit smoothies—intended to appeal to more consumers. But achieving speed and friendliness of service across the chain has been a particularly elusive goal, at least in part because about 90% of McDonald's restaurants in the U.S. are owned by independent operators. In QSR Magazine's annual Drive-Thru Study, the only comprehensive industry comparison of customer service at fast-food chains, other restaurants have consistently outperformed McDonald's in those areas. In last year's study, the average service time at the McDonald's drive-through studied was 188.83 seconds, compared with 129.75 for industry leader Wendy's Co.

"I think it's an ongoing problem, and it always will be," another McDonald's franchisee said. After McDonald's posted its first monthly same-store sales decline in nine years last October, company executives told investors that they underestimated the importance of "value" offerings for cash-strapped customers. The company has since added more items to its Dollar Menu and promoted those items in its ads. That formula has started to help. In January, the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts expectations, but Mr. Thompson cautioned that economic uncertainty still is expected to affect the company. McDonald's shares have also rebounded since they took a hit last fall. In 4 p.m. trading Wednesday, they were up 43 cents at $101.49, near their record of $102.22 in January 2012. Some analysts say McDonald's is continuing to lose customers. During its webcast, McDonald's told franchisees that customers rate good service almost as highly as dollar value, pointing to a National Restaurant Association survey. The reason behind the rise in customer complaints is unclear, but some franchisees say it could be partly because customers now have more ways to supply feedback. In recent years, the company has added an email address to its food packaging where customers can direct complaints, and restaurants in some regions of the country have recently started asking customers to fill out an online survey, using information on their receipts. High employee turnover also could be a contributor. While McDonald's declined to comment on its turnover, fast-food restaurants have an average annual turnover rate of 60%, according to a 2010 report from the National Restaurant Association. Monica George,
a McDonald's employee in Brooklyn, N.Y., said she can understand why customers complain, and that there are frustrations on both sides of the counter. "Let's say I'm in front at the register and the grill's not pushing out food quickly enough. So you have to wait on food, and the customer is getting aggravated at you because you're not giving them the food quick enough, and the grill gets aggravated with the cashier because we're asking where the food is," she said. Ms. George, who says she earns $7.25 an hour, said one problem behind slow service and inaccurate orders is that employees are trained to do specific tasks and don't always understand what other employees are doing. Franchisees say the company is doing several things to improve service, from boosting staffing at peak hours to rolling out a new system for taking orders. Under a new "dual point" ordering system that is being rolled out nationwide, the customer places an order at one end of the counter and is given a receipt with a number. When the order number appears on a screen, the customer picks up his food at the other end of the counter. The new position of "runner" has been created to do things like hand out cups and sauce packets, and fetch juice boxes for Happy Meals, freeing up the order taker to focus on the customer. The employee who delivers the food at the other end of the counter is supposed to thank customers and ask them to come again, according to franchisees. "Dual point provides personalized one-on-one service which directly improves order accuracy," according to a memo the company has sent to some franchisees, and which was reviewed by the Journal. "To the customer, we appear friendlier and better organized." At a downtown Chicago McDonald's that doesn't yet have the screens to display order numbers, but is starting to implement dual-point ordering by calling out the number on the receipts, service was fast and friendly on a recent day. Karen O'Mara,
a legal assistant who has been a customer there for the past seven years, said she has noticed a change since the restaurant began using the new system last year. "It's gotten faster," she said. "The service varies so much depending on which McDonald's you visit. It can vary from very friendly to very rude," said Jane Fiedler,
an office manager who occasionally visits the same downtown Chicago location. McDonald's also began using new software recently that helps restaurant owners decide the optimal number of employees to have on hand at a given time. And a new management structure, in which each manager is held accountable for a specific area of the operation, such as the kitchen or service, is expected to improve the customer experience, according to franchisees.
