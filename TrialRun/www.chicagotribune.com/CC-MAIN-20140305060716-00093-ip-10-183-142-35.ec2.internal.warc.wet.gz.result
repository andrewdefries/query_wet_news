But after elected President Mohammed Morsi claimed sweeping powers and rushed through a vote on a new constitution, tens of thousands of protesters chanted, "Shave your beard, show your disgrace, you will find that you have Mubarak's face!"
In Tunisia, President Moncef Marzouki, appearing at a ceremony commemorating the first revolution of the Arab Spring, was greeted by a stone-throwing crowd angry at police brutality. Human Rights Watch accused the Iraqi government of carrying out mass arrests and holding the detainees for months without charges and incommunicado.
The government that took over in Libya after Moammar Gadhafi's removal struggled to assert control over armed militias â€” including one that killed the U.S. ambassador. Morocco's king, who responded to the 2011 protests by agreeing to share power, was widely accused of taking it back.

Other union officials also violated law by drawing double pension benefits

Tribune staff reporter

Thomas Villanova isn't the only official from Local 134 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers who participated in a city pension and a union pension at the same time, in violation of state law. Three other local leaders who did so stand to collect more than $6 million from the municipal pension fund in their lifetimes, according to an analysis by the Tribune and WGN-TV. Like Villanova, all three retired from the city before the age of 60. Like Villanova, each signed an application saying he wasn't participating in his union's pension fund, and Local 134 officials wrote letters for all of them saying they weren't getting any union pension benefits. But they were. Timothy Foley, the union's business manager and financial secretary, retired in 2008 from a $47,000-a-year city job that he hadn't worked at since 1995. That was the year he took a leave of absence from his position as an electrical mechanic to go work for the union.
