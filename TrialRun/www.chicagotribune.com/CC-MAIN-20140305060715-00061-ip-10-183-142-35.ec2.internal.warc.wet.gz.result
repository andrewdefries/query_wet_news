Three summer reality TV shows use Chicago settings, but only one satisfies
Steve Johnson
Tribune reporter

Jerry Springer may have abandoned Chicago three years ago, but the impresario of camera-ready interpersonal conflict will be pleased to know that his influence remains.
It's certainly there in the two Chicago-based “reality” shows airing this summer, “Chicagolicious,” a sort of hair-salon confidential, and “Mob Wives Chicago,” which plays out like a middle school social scene, but in heavier eye makeup and without middle school's promise of eventual wisdom and maturity.
Like “Springer” guests, the people in these shows are ready to mix it up at the drop of an insult, or a perceived confrontational remark, or even something that couldn't possibly be taken as a slight yet somehow, miraculously, is. Why, it's almost as if the producers encourage their characters to mix it up whenever possible.
Apparently, “client comes in and gets a decent haircut” is not good TV. But “aging stylist vocationally threatened to a comical degree by any and everyone else” is.
The good news is that Chicago, to the extent that the city is pictured, looks spiffy in these shows, a place that — per ex-Mayor Richard Daley's vision of a clean, crisp, world-class urban playground — can at least provide sophisticated settings for sophomoric behavior. (And we presume, of course, that people recognize it's unfair to judge a geographical region by its reality TV participants. This is why, for instance, New Jersey continues to be held in esteem.)
The other good news is that a third reality show, “Secret Millionaire,” sets its Sunday episode in Chicago, and it is almost powerful enough to act as an anti-venom to the other two. Seeing suburban rich guy Steve Kaplan give away money on the South Side takes at least some of the sting out of having to endure probably seven or eight repeats of the hair-pulling fight the “Mob Wives” got into at a downtown bar.
It's a little hard to fathom how “Secret Millionaire,” with its determination to depict the pressing human need that most of television ignores, actually made it onto a network TV schedule,ABC's. But there it is, showing the other face of Chicago, where kids fight to resist gangs, homeless people bathe with hotel-soap castoffs and group homes battle to give seniors community and an alternative to the nursing home.
The other two series, though, are just standard-issue, reality-in-quotes fare, following on the high heels of assorted real housewives and celebrity families from other places.
You know the formula: Cast of characters is introduced, each with a trait that will define them for the run of the series: ingenue, stripper, what have you. An objective for the particular episode is announced — usually something very small, yet treated as if achieving it will change worlds. And then, with varying degrees of plausibility, the characters proceed to get in their own and one another's way.
These shows remind, constantly, of the old joke about academia: The fights are so vicious because the stakes are so low.
“Chicagolicious” is a bookend to an established Style Network show, “Jerseylicious,” which takes those willing to view it backstage at a New Jersey beauty parlor. The local edition is set at AJ's of Chicago, the West Randolph Street home of veteran stylist AJ Johnson, and it has a handful of likable peopl
