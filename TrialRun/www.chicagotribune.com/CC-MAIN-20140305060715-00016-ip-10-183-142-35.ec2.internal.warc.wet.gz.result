Schaumburg serious about growth
By Susan Diesenhouse
Tribune reporter
May 8, 2009

When Zamir Aslam moved to Schaumburg a decade ago, he drove to Chicago every month for food that reminded him of his native Pakistan. He hasn't had to make that trip in two years. "Now, I have several restaurants to choose from right here," he said of the new offerings in this restaurant and retail magnet. "There used to be very few people in Schaumburg who looked like me, but now I see them in every neighborhood and in the schools," said Aslam, 55, an accountant. "It's a good feeling." Indeed, many immigrants from Asia and the Middle East have been drawn here in recent years. In a village long known for residents of German and Polish descent, the influx of newcomers made up 15 percent of the population during the 2000 census and their numbers have grown substantially since, said Matt Frank, the village's economic development coordinator. But the core of lifelong residents is as loyal as ever. Take Steve O'Reilly, 47, who can be found on a Friday night having pizza and beer with guys he's known since childhood. For the American Airlines ramp attendant, Schaumburg offers an ideal location. "It's easy to get to the city, other suburbs, the highways, and with all the offices, it's a great place for work," said O'Reilly. As the northwest suburbs' commercial hub, Schaumburg sees its population of 75,000 swell to 150,000 each day. Commuters fill offices of Fortune 500 companies like Motorola with its 300-acre campus. Visitors also keep the cash registers ringing at the 66 shopping venues, including the enormous Woodfield Mall. O'Reilly likes lots of the changes he's seen in this village, which is set off by shimmering glass offices to the north, tree-lined residential cul-de-sacs to the south and extra wide roadways throughout. "When I first learned to drive, you had to head to the city to do anything," said O'Reilly, "Now, Schaumburg has everything: shopping, dining, entertainment." Don't even think about being bored here. The village boasts about 200 restaurants. O'Reilly is a fan of the pizza at Lou Malnati's, lodged in a 19th Century wood-framed house in the center of town. Village Tavern and Grill is known for its chicken fingers. Many love

Blast your look past dullsville
A single statement necklace can rev up your warm-weather wardrobe
Ellen Warren
May 25, 2012

It's people-watching season. Now that we're no longer swaddled in sweaters, jackets, coats and such, it's easy to spot the fashion items that make a big impression.
I've got one word for you: necklaces. With an exclamation point! Make that two!!
So many of us are on a shopping budget — I know I am — and looking for that Wonderful One Thing that will make any outfit look special.
After spending the last few weeks watching women stroll around town, the single item that makes me think, "Wow, does she look great," is a statement necklace.
Susan Swimmer, the fashion features editor at More magazine, found a neon-bright one at Ann Taylor for less than $100 that she wears all the time. Then she sent me the link to the Kate Spade necklace shown here so I could ooh and aah.
I did more than that. I headed to Nordstrom to try it on. It was
