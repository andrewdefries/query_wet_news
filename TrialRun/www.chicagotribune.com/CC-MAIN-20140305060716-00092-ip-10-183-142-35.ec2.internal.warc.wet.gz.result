Honda Classic not the same with Rory quitting, Tiger struggling A 'toothache' knocks world's No. 1 player out of Honda, while Woods continues to struggle Dave Hyde
Sun Sentinel Columnist
6:16 PM CST, March 2, 2013
PALM BEACH GARDENS

Luke Guthrie and Michael Thompson were Saturday's story at The Honda Classic. But Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods are still the story for golf.
McIlroy and Woods are No. 1 and No. 2 in the world. They're the tour's rainmakers. They drove this tournament's marketing, brought out fans and, for differing reasons, delivered nothing as hoped.
Woods' problem was golf. He's tied for 32nd entering Sunday's final round. It happens. The fact it happens with some consistency now remains Woods' central question moving forward.
But McIlroy's sudden, surprising and utterly stupefying decision to quit in mid-round while struggling on Friday, then later cite a toothache, remains the talk of golf and the larger sports world.
You're either a pro or you're not. You don't just quit in mid-competition
