'Submarine' review: A clever, funny path through well-worn material

*** (out of four)Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts) is like a lot of 15-year-olds: He tries to be smarter than he is while acknowledging he knows little, and he tries to do the right thing while admitting he can't let principles stand in the way of progress. His current issues: Trying to win and keep the heart (and sexual advances) of Jordana (Yasmin Paige), and preventing his mom (Sally Hawkins) from drifting away from her husband (Noah Taylor) and into the arms of her ex-lover, a ridiculous "mystic" named Graham (Paddy Considine).The buzz: No one will accuse "Submarine" of breaking new ground. Writer-director Richard Ayoade practically plants a big kiss o

Midlife brings a little pain here, a little ache there
By Ana Veciana-Suarez, Tribune Media Services

We're not what we used to be. We simply aren't -- and won't be again. Just one more hard fact that good intentions can't change.
Such was the consensus at a party the other night when friends, all of a certain age, ticked off assorted aches and ailments, a litany that would be depressing if it weren't so hilariously universal. We aren't as quick, as limber, as flexible as we once were. Not by a long shot. Our bodies, those wonderful machines we blithely mistreated 20 or 30 years ago, are finally showing wear.
Ouch. Ay. And, Not again!
So this is middle age. When you have to stop to use the restroom at every other turnpike plaza. When you're as stiff as a two-by-four after three hours in front of the television. When you leave reading glasses all over the house just in case. When your hair, if you have any, grows in all the wrong places. When the absence of pain is cause for celebration -- just don't forget the antacid.
Yep, we're there. Midlife. Gulp.
Example No. 1: A friend danced the night away at her husband's 51st birthday. The life of the party, she twisted and shimmied, hopped and leaped all evening. Twenty-four hours later, she was prostrate, ice packs on her lower back.
