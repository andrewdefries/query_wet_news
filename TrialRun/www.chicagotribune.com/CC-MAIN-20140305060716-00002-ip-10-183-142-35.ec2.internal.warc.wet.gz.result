Teel Time: Swofford met with Virginia Board to discuss ACC's grant of rights By David Teel

Less than 24 hours before ACC presidents unanimously approved the conference’s landmark grant of rights last month, commissioner John Swofford met with Virginia’s Board of Visitors in Charlottesville. But the trip was not a last-minute sales pitch to a skittish client that might take its business elsewhere.
Swofford dismissed incessant speculation that the school was considering a move to the Big Ten and was confident that U.Va. president Teresa Sullivan would sign the grant.

Indeed, the Seminoles and their renowned football program were the last barrier to the unanimity the grant required.
Those stories parenthetically mentioned Swofford’s trip to Charlottesville, prompting some to wonder if Virginia might have been tempted to join Maryland in exiting the ACC for the Big Ten. Jim Delany, the Big Ten’s commissioner and Swofford’s former college classmate at North Carolina, then added to the intrigue by telling reporters that his confe
