In 2012, I graduated college with a 3.5 GPA – not stellar, but paired with charity work, extracurricular activities, and a degree from the #2 ranked undergraduate business program in the country, it looked like I was in good shape.

Several Obama choices for top positions have dealt with tax problems, including the president's first pick for HHS secretary, former Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle. Nancy Killefer also faced tax questions and withdrew her candidacy to be the first chief performance officer for the federal government.

Obama: Kennedy was the ‘greatest legislator of our time’
Top U.S. officials join members of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's family at Kennedy's funeral services in Boston, on Aug. 29. The "liberal lion" of the Senate was a key ally of Obama's during the 2008 presidential campaign and a lifelong champion of health care reform -- the item that topped Obama's domestic agenda during the first year of his presidency. Kennedy died after a long battle with brain cancer.

A portrait of Barack Obama is seen next to a photo of Martin Luther King, Jr., in the exhibition hall of the Nobel Peace Center in Oslo, Norway on Oct. 10. The president and his staff were surprised when notified that Obama had been awarded the honor, and its acceptance was made particularly difficult for the president because he was in the midst of calculating the extent of the buildup of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. In his acceptance speech in Oslo, Obama called the prize "a call to action," but also made the case that some wars are necessary.
