Video: Obama to Congress: Let's 'move forward' together Open in new window
Closed captioning of: Obama to Congress: Let's 'move forward' together Advertise
>>>
obama's state of the union address
. he heads to wisconsin today bringing the message he laid out in the speech directly to voters. savannah guthrie
has details. good morning.
>> reporter: good morning to you, meredith. aids say they were trying to do something different with the state of the union
. more broad themes. less of a laundry list of policy proposals. but with republicans and democrats sitting side by side
, there was a different feel in the room.
>>
mr. speaker, the president of the united states
! [ cheers and applause ]
>> reporter: the president entered into a new era in washington with a nod to the new republican speaker and a moment for the arizona congresswoman who couldn't be there.
>>
we are also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber and we pray for the health of our colleague and our friend gabby giffords
. [ applause ]
>> reporter: giffords' husband watched the speech from her hospital room holding her hand while the parents of 9-year-old victim christina taylor green watched from the guest box. members wore black and white
ribbons in giffords' honor.
>>
there is a reason the tragedy gave us pause. we are still bound together as one people. we share common hopes and a common creed that the dreams of a little girl
in tucson are not so different than those of our own children and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled.
>> reporter: amidst calls for more civility there was a different tone in the room. gone were the partisan cheers of the past several years. dozens of republicans and democrats chose to sit together. senators mccain and kerry, thune and gillibrand.
>>
what comes of this moment is not whether we can sit together tonight but whether we can work together tomorrow.
>> reporter: the pitch, increased spending in energy, infrastructure and innovation to create jobs and keep america competitive with countries like china and india.
>>
we need to outinnovate, outeducate and outbuild the rest of the world
.
>> reporter: in a room full of republicans brought into power on a no spending platform, the president called for a five-year freeze in the domestic nonsecurity budget.
>>
every day families sacrifice to live within their means. they deserve a government that does the same. i recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and i'm willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without, but let's make sure we're not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.
>> reporter: the president also called for reforming the corporate tax code and just days after house republicans voted to repeal the president's health care law
, mr. obama defended it.
>>
if you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, i am eager to work with you. instead of refighting the battles of the last two years let's fix what needs fixing and move forward.
>> reporter: republicans had what amounted to duelling responses. paul ryan
offered the official gop response.
>>
the debt will soon eclipse our economy and grow to catastrophic levels in the years ahead.
>> reporter: while michelle bachmann
took to the internet. she later told brian williams
she was not trying to divide the party.
>>
this wasn't competition with what the gop official response was.
>> reporter: closing his speech, the president saved the traditional line for the end.
>>
it's because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong.
>> reporter: the president plans to sell his message about winning the future in the coming weeks. it starts in wisconsin today. matt, watch this space, literally. we may get a personnel announcement about a new press secretary briefing from this room as early as tomorrow.
>>
