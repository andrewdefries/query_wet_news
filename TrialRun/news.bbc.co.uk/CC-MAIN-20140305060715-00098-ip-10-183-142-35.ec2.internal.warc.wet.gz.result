Hong Kong 'flu' hotel guests free
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
The guests cheered as they were released from the hotel
Nearly 300 guests and staff at a hotel in Hong Kong have been released after being held in quarantine for a week due to a feared outbreak of swine flu.
All were given health checks before leaving the Metropark Hotel. They were isolated after a Mexican traveller carrying the virus stayed in the hotel. Meanwhile, Mexico raised its flu death toll to 45, but the health minister said the virus was on the wane. The number of confirmed infections in the US has nearly doubled to 1,639. Two people have died in the US. A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dave Daigle, said the cases had been registered in 43 states, according to the AFP news agency. He said he expected to find confirmed cases in all 50 US states because there were now more testing facilities in America. But he stressed that the epidemic was not speeding up. I'm happy! I love Hong Kong people!
South Korean guest released from Metropark Hotel
In Mexico City, Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said the country's swine flu death toll now stood at 45, but one more fatality was not a new infection. Mr Cordova also said the number of confirmed cases across the country rose by 159 to 1,319. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was not recommending travel restrictions related to the outbreak of swine flu. Speaking in Bangkok, WHO chief Margaret Chan said that "the world is better prepared for an influenza pandemic than at any time in history". 'Breathe easily'
Hotel guests cheered and waved to bystanders as they walked out of the Metropark Hotel on Friday. We have been successful in our effort to prevent the spread of the virus, but this doesn't mean that we can relax our guard
York Chow
Hong Kong Health Secretary
UK swine flu genetics unravelled "I'm happy! I love Hong Kong people!" a South Korean businessman, who did not give his name, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. The unidentified Mexican man was also released from a Hong Kong hospital on Friday. Hong Kong officials earlier apologised to those held, but said it was in the public interest. Hong Kong's Health Secretary York Chow said: "I am sure everyone feels... that Hong Kong has passed its first test and we can breathe more easily." "We have been successful in our effort to prevent the spread of the virus, but this doesn't mean that we can relax our guard," he added. Authorities have offered guests of the city centre hotel two nights' free accommodation at another of Hong Kong's luxury hotels to compensate for the inconvenience. Although critics called the quarantine an over-reaction, officials were keen to avoid a repeat of the 2003 Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic. That outbreak killed 300 people in Hong Kong and 800 worldwide after a single carrier spread the disease in a city hotel. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Russian ex-spies flex their muscles
This week Russian communists laid flowers at the tomb of Soviet secret police founder Felix Dzerzhinsky, on the 130th anniversary of his birth. The BBC's James Rodgers in Moscow examines the enduring influence of the secret police in the era of President Vladimir Putin - himself a former KGB officer.
Dzerzhinsky set up a secret police force that once terrorised Russia
Communist-era secret police became hate figures across much of the Soviet bloc during the Cold War. When those regimes unravelled in the late 1980s and early 1990s, people celebrated their demise. Archives were opened, informers were exposed, former dissidents became presidents. But in Russia, things turned out differently. After a decade of unpredictable change - in which jobs, savings, and many of the certainties which had come with communism simply disappeared - Russians looked for another solution. In March 2000, they turned not to a dissident writer or activist. They elected a former KGB officer to lead the country. As he prepares to leave office next spring, Vladimir Putin enjoys popularity ratings his predecessors could never have dreamed of. His KGB past has proved no obstacle to widespread support among the population. Soviet iron fist
The secret police under one name or another were a hugely influential force in Russia throughout the Soviet period. Working in intelligence you need to be informed about a lot of things and you need to be able to work with people and respect your partners
President Vladimir Putin
They began as the "Cheka" - from the Russian letters standing for "Extraordinary Commission". In that incarnation, they gave the Russian language the word "Chekist". The ties of loyalty which agents develop are supposed to last for life. As the saying goes, "there's no such thing as a former Chekist".
KGB veterans may add: "there are only traitors".
Many of Mr Putin's former fellow officers have prospered during his tenure. They are known in Russian today as the siloviki. The name comes from the Russian word sila, meaning "strength" or "power". Privileged elite
In Soviet times, those who joined the KGB's ranks were in a position of privilege. They were considered reliable enough to see and hear things which the Soviet regime kept from the majority of the population. Mr Ivanov and Mr Putin, both ex-KGB, are close associates
Foreign travel was a rare opportunity. It gave those lucky enough to get it an experience denied to their follow citizens. They gained an understanding of the world as it really was, not just as it appeared in the Soviet media. They served under the guise of diplomats, journalists and members of trade delegations. Top-quality language tuition had equipped them for intelligence-gathering.
Their varied experience and extensive contacts gave them the qualities they needed to find their way through the chaos and uncertainty of Russia in its immediate post-Soviet years. Not only have they survived, they have succeeded. KGB agents, and those from the KGB's main successor agency, the FSB (Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, or State Security Service), are among those making millions from Russia's economic boom. "Former KGB officers and current FSB officers are increasing their influence in the oil and gas industries," says Mikhail Krutikhin, of Rusenergia. Mr Krutikhin's years as a foreign correspondent for the Tass news agency brought him into frequent contact with Soviet intelligence officers. He sees the hand of their successors in Russia's richest industries, which he now follows as an analyst. "Russian companies have 'curators' assigned to them," he explains. "They make requests and demands for information on foreign clients." Shadowy careers
Mr Putin himself has spoken proudly of his past in the KGB, suggesting that the experience has helped him as head of state. Many of those now occupying positions of power in the Kremlin, and in the top levels of Russian business - the two often overlap - are believed to have been KGB agents. Their official biographies rarely spell it out, but gaps in individual CVs, or foreign postings during Soviet times, strongly suggest it. Olga Kryshtanovskaya, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has studied the country's centres of power since the late 1980s. This is what she sees today. "A quarter of the political elite are siloviki," she says. Her definition includes not only the KGB, but also the military and other security forces. That's only the ones who publicly admit to it. It is not in the nature of many secret policemen to disclose their identity. Ms Kryshtanovskaya estimates that when those she describes as "affiliated" - that is, not publicly declared - are taken into account, the figure could be as high as three-quarters. One of those who makes no secret of his KGB past is Sergei Ivanov. "I am proud of it," he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme last year. Mr Ivanov is currently one of Russia's first deputy prime ministers. He is frequently spoken of as a likely successor to Mr Putin. The siloviki look set to stay strong. E-mail this to a friend

Science in search of the low rumble
Infrasound can be used to communicate over thousands of km
The study of low frequency sound is giving science new perspectives on the natural world as well as helping to develop novel weapons technologies. Julian Trick reports. Sound waves so low in frequency that the human ear cannot detect them may be behind ghostly sightings and haunted buildings.
Human ears detect sounds in the frequency range of about 20 to 20,000 Hertz, or cycles per second. Anything below 20 Hz is defined as infrasound, which although not heard, is experienced in the form of pure vibrations. This is not a new phenomenon; church organ builders have been using infrasonic pipes for over 250 years
Sarah Angliss
The discovery that infrasonic waves are present in a number of allegedly haunted houses in the UK has prompted scientists to investigate the effect of the waves on human emotions.
The audience at an experimental piano recital, where the music was laced with bursts of infrasound, were asked to record their mood at particular times during the concert. Some people reported feelings of calmness and euphoria when the infrasonic pipes were switched on. However, others were unable to detect any change in mood.
Starting note
Dr Richard Wiseman, of Hertfordshire University, UK, believes it is the vibrations of low frequency acoustic waves, felt particularly in the stomach, which may cause the recipient to feel uplifted or create unease depending on the environment in which they are experienced.
Infrasound detectors can help verify arms treaties "This is not a new phenomenon; church organ builders have been using infrasonic pipes for over 250 years to create a sense of awe in congregations," says Sarah Angliss, an engineer and composer involved in the music project. The animal kingdom uses infrasound, too. "The discovery that elephants use low frequency acoustics to communicate over large distances may explain the ability of separated family groups to co-ordinate their pattern of movement for weeks at a time, and the ability of lone males to find a mate in the wildernesses of the African Savannah," says Dr Katy Payne, of Cornell University, New York, US.
Dr Payne has studied elephant communication for 15 years. She realised that vibrations in the air near an elephant enclosure at a local zoo reminded her of standing near infrasonic church pipes when she sang in a choir as a girl. Deep burst
Further investigation revealed that elephant calls range from 5 Hz (infrasonic range) to 50 Hz (audible range) and in the right conditions can travel many kilometres. Blue whales are also known to use infrasonic waves to communicate. Low frequency sound waves travel huge distances in water, allowing the whales keep in touch over hundreds, if not thousands, of kilometres. However, the underwater hotline is now under threat from noise pollution created by human sources such as ships, submarines and drilling operations, which create large amounts of infrasound in the depths of the ocean. Some whales are also thought to use huge bursts of infrasound to stun the mysterious giant squid, which have never been seen alive in their natural habitat, before devouring them. Sound shot
A more sinister use of infrasonic waves is in the application of non-lethal weaponry. Elephants are a focus for research
Since the 1950s, scientists have been developing infrasonic devices which produce acoustic waves in the 1 to 10 Hz range. Sound waves at these frequencies were found to vibrate internal organs, incapacitating opponents for hours, even days and sometimes leading to fatalities. The main difficulty in developing these types of weapon is the huge amplitudes required to make them effective, and then directing the waves to a specific point. Early warning
Non-military applications for infrasonic weaponry would include crowd control and personal protection.
The huge destructive power of infrasound is apparent in nuclear explosions. Waves of infrasound can be detected 2,500-3,500 km away from a blast in under two hours using a monitoring network set up under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
The same network is used to monitor geophysical processes, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, avalanches and severe weather, which also produce the low frequency sound waves. Monitoring of such activity could give rise to advanced warning of catastrophic events saving thousands of lives across the world. See also:

Campbell staying with Spurs
Campbell's future is the subject of frenzied speculation
Spurs director of football David Pleat has told the BBC that Sol Campbell will be playing for the club next season. The England defender's current contract at White Hart Lane runs out at the end of next season. Spurs are desperate to keep him although there has been speculation about a move to Manchester United.
Weekend newspaper reports suggested a big-money move to Old Trafford was imminent but it appears Campbell is not keen on a summer transfer.
Pleat is confident that Campbell will stay
Pleat told Radio 5 Live that Campbell wants to see out his current contract and play next season. He said: "Sol has stated quite clearly he only talks about contracts in the summer. It is summer and we are literally speaking to him now.
"Sol has said he won't be going anywhere this summer whatever happens. He will stay and see out his contract.
"So he'll be in our team next season."
The move leaves Campbell in a powerful negotiating position during the contract talks, with Spurs aware of the implications if they cannot agree a new deal.
They could lose the player on a free transfer in summer 2001 if he does not sign a long-term contract, a factor which means a big money move could still take place before that date.
Ginola assurance
Meanwhile David Ginola has been assured by manager George Graham that he has a
future at the club.
But the Spurs boss says the Frenchman must accept that he will be left out of the team on
occasions.
I would bet David has started more games than the likes of Gianfranco Zola,
Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars and Kanu
George Graham
Ginola's future at White Hart Lane has been thrown into doubt after he was
dropped for Saturday's clash against Manchester United at Old Trafford.
"David has an important part to play for Tottenham next season, and I want
him to stay," Graham told The Evening Standard.
"Everyone is aware how much I want to bring in new players to strengthen the
squad.
"If I manage to do that then hopefully we will be able to do what
clubs like Chelsea and Arsenal do in using their players.
"I would bet David has started more games than the likes of Gianfranco Zola,
Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars and Kanu. "If I get it right with my squad that is
the kind of situation I want to happen at Tottenham."

Ruth Ellis: Villain or victim?
The vigil outside Holloway Prison for Ellis's execution
The name Ruth Ellis is guaranteed a place in the history of British crime. In 1955 she became the last woman to be hanged in the UK. But now her family is claiming the authorities should look again at the case, writes Jonathan Morris.
Ruth Ellis is being portrayed as a victim of a cruel boyfriend who abused her, and a cruel legal system that hanged her.
Ellis's sister, Muriel Jakubait, 77, wants her conviction reduced to manslaughter.
She says the jury was never told that David Blakely treated Ellis violently and caused her to miscarry by punching her in the stomach.
The jury was also not told that she had been raped by her father as a child, and was addicted to anti-depressants. David Blakely and Ruth Ellis: Tempestuous relationship
Ms Jakubait believes that her mental state at the time meant she should never have been convicted of murder.
If found guilty of manslaughter, Ellis would probably have received a prison sentence totalling a few years, instead of the capital punishment of hanging. Ellis, 28, was hanged after killing her lover Mr Blakely outside a pub in Hampstead, north London, in 1955. Mr Blakely and Ellis formed a passionate and tempestuous relationship after they met in a London night club which Ellis managed.
Ellis suspected Mr Blakely was having an affair with a friend's nanny and in a pique of jealousy and rejection, she went to Hampstead where she lay in wait outside the Magdala public house in South Hill Park.
Mr Blakely came out of the pub with a friend and Ellis shot him five times, the last shot from point blank range, as he lay wounded on the ground.
Other drinkers came out of the pub to see what had happened and Ellis was arrested, still holding the smoking gun, by an off-duty policeman.
Platinum blonde
Her trial opened on Monday 20 June 1955 in the Old Bailey's Number One Court.
Ellis wore a black two-piece suit and white blouse, her hair re-dyed to her preferred platinum blonde.
The image - hardly one of the poor downtrodden woman - was her defence team's idea.
She pleaded not guilty, but when prosecuting counsel, Mr Christmas Humphries asked her "Mrs. Ellis, when you fired that revolver at close range into the body of David Blakely what did you intend to do," she replied: "It was obvious that when I shot him I intended to kill him."
Derek Bentley: Campaign led to a film, and then to being cleared
The jury found her guilty after deliberating for only 14 minutes.
Ellis spent just three weeks and three days in the condemned cell at Holloway Prison.
When she was executed about 1,000 people stood silently outside the prison waiting for the execution notice to be posted outside the gates.
The case has inspired several books, television programmes and the 1985 film, Dance with a Stranger, starring Miranda Richardson.
It is the latest in a long line of celebrated legal cases which come under close scrutiny. Derek Bentley, who was wrongly hanged in 1953, had his conviction quashed in 1998.
Earlier this year it was announced that the Court of Appeal will review the case of James Hanratty, executed in 1962 for the notorious A6 murders.

What's on David Cameron's iPod?
The Smiths: Top of the Pops in 1985
Tory leader David Cameron has revealed the contents of his new music player.
Mr Cameron said the iPod nano - a Christmas gift from his wife Samantha - was filled with a "real mix" of music from The Smiths and Blur to Bob Dylan.
He said his favourite album was by the Killers. Asked on Radio 1 whether he preferred Will Young or James Blunt, he went for the Pop Idol winner.
He told DJs Colin and Edith he enjoyed "a lot of gloomy stuff" but drew the line at gravel-voiced Tom Waits.
'Gloomy music'
"Because I'm 39, there's The Smiths, Radiohead, Pulp, Blur - all that quite gloomy music.
"I'm a big Bob Dylan fan - there's a lot of Bob Dylan but I'm not a Tom Waits fan. There's a lot of reggae on it. The Killers album I think is fantastic - that is my like favourite album at the moment."
He also name checked Radiohead and the Ramones.
Mr Cameron also told Colin and Edith he had given up smoking again at the New Year, having earlier returned to the habit during the Tory leadership contest.
"I've got a patch on and this time it's real. I gave up for seven months last year and during the leadership election the pressure got a bit too great and I'm afraid I went back on the fags.
"But I thought this time, that's it. I'm hoping to kick it."
Poker
When quizzed on other vices Mr Cameron confessed to playing poker when he was at Oxford University, saying: "I lost money and I stopped. I've never played online. I have a face that you can just see exactly when I'm bluffing."
Asked by presenter Colin Murray which member of Girls Aloud was most likely to "get a bit of the Cameron love" if he was single, the Tory leader initially said: "It is an impossible choice."
Tory leader arrives for Radio 1 grilling
He was shown a calendar of the group and pressed for an answer - and then advised to pick the one who looked most like his wife.
He replied: "The one on the left", which was Cheryl Tweedy.
Tony Blair, who was briefly in a student rock band, has also made much of his love of rock music, claiming in the past to enjoy The Darkness, Coldplay and the Foo Fighters. Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said he is a big fan of David Bowie.
During the interview he was asked whether he would rather be joined in a civil partnership with Tony Blair or Charles Kennedy.
Mr Cameron picked Charles Kennedy because he thought he would be "more fun" than Tony Blair.

Brown denies President Obama snub
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
Gordon Brown: The special relationship has never been stronger
Gordon Brown has denied being snubbed by the US president after diplomatic sources told the BBC his team had been "frantic" to secure bilateral talks.Mr Brown said he and President Barack Obama "talk all the time" and he insisted the special relationship was "strong and continues to strengthen". No 10 said they had a wide-ranging chat after a UN dinner - understood to have taken place in the UN's kitchens. And the White House described the claim of Mr Brown being snubbed as "absurd".

Asked about the alleged snub during an interview with NBC news on Wednesday, the prime minister said: "I met President Obama last night and we had a long talk about some of the big issues affecting us and I'll be meeting him in Pittsburgh one to one. "But of course we're meeting all the time. We're both involved in all the main meetings and talk all the time. "I do say that the special relationship between Britain and America is strong, it continues to strengthen and I think the reason it's strong is that it's based on common values." He later told the BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, that he and Mr Obama had "a strong personal friendship". The prime minister, who earlier referred to his Labour colleagues as "fighters", also said he had been "right" about his actions to restructure Britain's banks and tackle the recession. 'Without foundation'Northern Ireland secretary Shaun Woodward told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reported snub was the type of "trivia" which tended to accompany prime ministerial trips abroad. He also said if he counted the times this week the two men had already talked in New York he "would run out of fingers on one hand". It reveals how keen Labour strategists were to play the Obama and Gordon card before their conference
Nick RobinsonBBC political editor
Read Nick's thoughts in full
He was responding to the news that White House officials rejected repeated requests from Britain for a formal meeting - even though the president has held private meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street said reports of a snub were "completely without foundation". A spokeswoman said "formal bilaterals were not pinned down", and added: "We have said all along that the meeting situation was fluid, but the prime minister and Barack Obama would be together and have an opportunity to meet which has happened." Asked whether there were five requests for a bilateral meeting as has been suggested, she said that in the run-up to the trip there would have been numerous calls, but the number was not the issue. Business Secretary Lord Mandelson dismissed the story of a snub as a "rumour" that ordinary people were not interested in. "I think it would really just strike them as, frankly, pretty juvenile to have this personality stuff substituted for what really are very serious issues that these leaders are talking about in New York," he told the BBC. 'Terrific relationship'
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

The White House also rejected any suggestion that Mr Brown had been given a lower priority than other leaders. A spokesman said: "Any stories that suggest trouble in the bilateral relationship between the United States and UK are totally absurd. "We would add that President Obama and Prime Minister Brown enjoy a terrific relationship, they speak regularly on a range of the most difficult challenges facing our two nations and meet frequently." The spokesman pointed to "the tight and extensive work our countries carry out together to address common challenges across the globe" as evidence of the closeness of the relationship. The row comes after Mr Obama described the Lockerbie bomber's release as a "mistake". But Dr Robin Niblett, from think tank Chatham House, said the Obama government was "pragmatic" and understood that the decision over Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi had been a difficult one. "I think this administration, including President Obama, was very upset by the release, but I don't think that they would make the point of trying to do a snub in retort," Dr Niblett told the BBC.

He said Mr Obama simply had other priorities at the summit such as working on relations with Russia and China, adding: "This was the wrong time to be pushing for a special bilateral meeting." BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the whole episode revealed how keen Labour strategists were to play "the Obama and Gordon card" before their annual party conference, which starts on Sunday. He said: "If they hadn't been so desperate, this would never have been a story at all. After all, no other EU country's leader got a meeting with Obama." The two leaders will co-host an event for the Friends of Democratic Pakistan in New York on Thursday.

Queen sees medical advances in Cardiff
Seven year old Emily Morgan presented a bouquet
The Queen, who has been visiting Cardiff, has heard about pioneering medical work at the university.
Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, she was shown how the University of Wales was collaborating with businesses on a range of innovative projects.
Professor Paul Chapman, of the School of Biosciences, showed the Queen the work being done at the university to combat Alzheimer's disease.
He said: "She asked how could you tell whether you had Alzheimer's or whether you were ordinarily forgetting through old age. I told her it was a difficult problem."
Alzheimer's disease
The Professor saidr: "Memory loss in Alzheimer's is more acute than in normal old age." During her tour of the university's laboratories, the Queen also saw how it had helped develop a new test to determine different strains of meningitis.
She also visited the university's eye clinic where she met seven-year-old Emily Morgan, from Pontyclun, in south Wales.
The Queen unveiled a plaque at the new Tenovus laboroatories
Showing no sign of nerves Emily, who has Down's Syndrome, jumped out of her chair and raced up to the Queen with a posy of flowers when she entered the clinic.
Emily has to have regular eye tests at the clinic and she showed the Queen how they were carried out.
As the Royal visitor left the room Emily stopped the Queen in her tracks by shouting, "Bye, Queen, bye." The Queen also unveiled a plaque to open the new Tenovus Laboratories at the School of Pharmacy. She met 90-year-old Eddie Price one of the founder members of Tenovus, a cancer charity he and nine friends set up in Cardiff 55 years ago. Later the Queen also opened the new School of Social Sciences at a ceremony in the Glamorgan Building Council Chamber.
The Queen visited Cardiff University
On her final engagement of the day the Queen opened a new technology department at Fitzalan High School in Cardiff
The school has strong multi-cultural links with pupils from 30 nations speaking 22 different languages and on her arrival the Queen was greeted in several of those different languages, including Welsh.
Headteacher Angus Dunphy said: "We have dragged this school up by the bootlaces. Before there used to be around 12 pupils going on to further education, now the total is around 30." "Today was about celebrating that success," he added.
"It is important considering the debate that is currently going on about social exclusion at universities."
"Everybody should be treated the same."

US Potter book adverts for adults
1/4 Some cool slogans are on the ads, this one says: There's some pretty tough stuff in Harry Potter - Bad guys so bad they're called Death Eaters.
2/4 There's some pretty intense stuff in Harry Potter - a lightning-fast game called Quidditch with wild rules and a major chance of injury.
3/4 There's some totally rad stuff in Harry Potter - Skele-Gro repairs broken bones instantly. What could be better for a kick flip gone wrong?
4/4 There are some pretty stylish things in Harry Potter - invisibilty cloaks ie. the only item that goes with every item in a girl's closet.

Cockerill confirms Dupuy to stay
Dupuy scores the winning try
French scrum-half Julien Dupuy will be with Leicester next season, according to head coach Richard Cockerill.
"He's under contract, though his girlfriend (who lives in France) is a bit unsettled," said Cockerill. "We've had talks and he'll be here next year. "We will make it as easy as possible for him to come and go back to France but he will be here for next season." Dupuy's sparkling individual try late on gave Leicester a 20-15 Heineken Cup quarter-final win over Bath. With just seconds remaining Dupuy wheeled away from the base of a Leicester ruck, broke through the Bath defence and scored under the posts. "Dupuy's bit of magic at the end was as good as it gets," added Cockerill.
606: DEBATE
Have your say on Leicester's victory
Cardiff lie in wait in the semi-final in a game that will be staged at the Millennium Stadium but it was Dupuy's "world-class" finish that had the Leicester coach purring with pleasure. "Julien put some pace on the game against some tired defenders. He is one of the best players in the world at what he does. Even when he made the break he still had some work to do."
