Yahoo! delivers growth and earnings
Internet portal and access provider Yahoo! has surprised investors by reporting much stronger second-quarter earnings than expected.
The results will come as a relief to the internet sector, which has been out of fashion on the stockmarkets lately. As a result, the share price of many online firms has been severly depressed, starving many firms of a ready source for capital.
On Tuesday, the doubters were still in the majority. Yahoo's share price lost as much as 8%, as investors feared that the company might not be able to continue the strong performance shown during the past year.
But Yahoo! proved them wrong. 680m page views per day
The internet figures are impressive: Page views rose to an average 680m per day in June, up from 625m in March, while Yahoo!'s various web sites recorded 156m unique users worldwide, including 20m in Japan.
Yahoo! chairman Tim Koogle said: "This quarter's better-than expected financial results underscore the strength of our global franchise business." Net earnings weighed in at $73.9m, up 274% on the same period last year when the firm recorded just $27m. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings per share of 10 cents, and the "whisper" figure - making the rounds just before results were released - had pushed expectations to 11 cents.
But Yahoo! trumped this with earnings of 12 cents per share in the April-to-June period.
Sales during the quarter rose 110% to $270.12m.
Jeff Mallett, Yahoo!'s president and chief operating officer, said: "We made significant progress this quarter in our five key areas of focus - mobile services, rich media and voice services, enabling transactions, business and enterprise services, and globalisation."
Investors reacted positively to the news. In after-hours trading the firm's shares gained $7.5 to $113.

Netanyahu holds talks with Obama amid settlement row
The talks at the White House were held behind closed doors
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has held talks with US President Barack Obama - their first meeting since a row over plans to build homes in East Jerusalem.They held two meetings at the White House in what the Israelis said was a "good atmosphere". Mr Netanyahu had warned earlier that Middle East peace talks could be further delayed by Palestinian demands for a freeze on settlement building. The Palestinians said Mr Netanyahu's policy was stalling the peace process. Meanwhile, it emerged on Tuesday evening that the Jerusalem municipal government had just approved the building of 20 new apartments for Jews on the site of an old hotel in the Sheikh Jarrah area of East Jerusalem. 'No concessions'The news drew criticism from chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat, who said in a statement that Israel was "digging itself into a hole".

Read more Israeli media reaction
An Israeli Likud MP, MK Yariv Levin, was quoted as saying the building approval was the "translation of Netanyahu's words into deeds" - referring to the PM's assertion on Monday of Israel's "right to build" in Jerusalem. A White House official told the BBC that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Obama had first met for about 90 minutes. He added that the US president later went to his residence, but Mr Netanyahu requested another meeting and the two leaders spent another 30 minutes together. The Israeli prime minister's office said there was "a good atmosphere" during the talks. But the White House had no immediate comment on their content. In a break with convention, reporters were not invited to witness the pair shake hands at the start of their discussions. It was a pointed contrast with the traditional public welcome for Israeli leaders at the White House, the BBC's Steve Kingstone in Washington reports. Our correspondent says that for the Americans it reflects an uncomfortable fact: that in the wake of a full-scale diplomatic row, Mr Netanyahu came to Washington offering no obvious concessions. ANALYSIS
Paul Wood, BBC News, Jerusalem
The final building permits for the Shepherd Hotel development in East Jerusalem came through just a few hours before Benjamin Netanyahu's meeting with President Obama. Mr Netanyahu has supposedly put in place a procedure - involving the vetting of announcements by senior officials - to prevent such embarrassments. Clearly it is not working.
Israeli officials will no doubt, once again, try to portray this as a low-level bureaucratic decision which has no relationship to the high diplomacy between Israel and the US. Since the US has protested about this project, small as it may be, before, that is not really credible.This may have come about - as with the Ramat Shlomo announcement - because right-wingers are seeking to make themselves look good to their own supporters by making Mr Netanyahu look bad. Conversely, sources in the Jerusalem municipality have accused the Israeli left of publicising the new building permits in order to "rekindle the situation on the ground".The Israeli prime minister's officials spent a great deal of time explaining the realities of coalition politics here to Joe Biden's people when the Ramat Shlomo debacle happened during the vice-president's visit. It looks as if it is time for those same explanations to be rolled out again.
At an earlier meeting with US congressional leaders, Mr Netanyahu described the Palestinian demands on a construction freeze as "illogical and unreasonable". "It could put the peace negotiations on hold for another year," he said. Last week Mr Obama said the approval of plans for 1,600 homes in Ramat Shlomo was not helpful to the peace process. But on Monday, Mr Netanyahu reasserted Israel's "right to build" in Jerusalem. Nearly 500,000 Jews live in more than 100 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. They are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. The Palestinian Authority is furious at Israel's insistence on building on occupied territory. It sees it as a serious stumbling block to the resumption of talks, which have been stalled for more than a year. "Netanyahu's policy is the one that is obstructing the return to negotiations," Nabil Abu Rdainah, a senior aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, told Reuters news agency in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Mr Obama has largely refrained from commenting publicly on the announcement of new construction in East Jerusalem, which came while Vice-President Joe Biden was visiting Israel two weeks ago. Instead, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, along with Mr Biden and several top aides, has repeatedly criticised the Israeli government for jeopardising the indirect "proximity talks" being mediated by US special envoy George Mitchell. Clinton criticalIn a speech to an influential pro-Israeli lobby group on Monday, Mrs Clinton demanded that Israel move to restore confidence in the peace process, not least by extending the 10-month suspension of new building in the West Bank to include East Jerusalem. She told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) members that the continued expansion of Jewish settlements undermined "mutual trust and endangers the proximity talks that are the first step toward the full negotiations that both sides want and need". Jerusalem is not a settlement. It's our capital
Benjamin NetanyahuIsraeli prime minister

Issues: Borders and settlements
"It exposes daylight between Israel and the United States that others in the region hope to exploit," she added. In his speech to Aipac on the same day, Mr Netanyahu said: "The Jewish people were building Jerusalem 3,000 years ago and the Jewish people are building Jerusalem today. "Jerusalem is not a settlement. It's our capital." The BBC's Paul Wood in Jerusalem says that what details there are of the talks in Washington suggest that the US and Israeli leaders are clearly down to hard negotiations, and the stage is set for a historic test of wills. On the Israeli side, there is a neurosis about the important relationship with the US, our correspondent says. But the US will also be concerned that when there is daylight between the two countries, it points to trouble in the region. The last thing the US wants is for this to turn into some sort of problem that would encourage Israel's enemies there, our correspondent adds. POINTS OF TENSION IN JERUSALEM

Broadband 'in every home by 2012'
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Culture Secretary Andy Burnham outlines the report's interim findings
All UK homes should have access to broadband and faster download speeds by 2012, the government has said.
An interim report on the UK's digital future also looked at plans for public service broadcasting.
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said digital technology was as important today as "roads, bridges and trains were in the 20th Century".
But the Conservatives said the report promised "no new action". The Lib Dems said it was a "complete damp squib".
Culture Secretary Andy Burnham told MPs it would help Britain secure a competitive low carbon economy in the next five to 10 years, adding the country "led the world in content creation". Every aspect of our lives... will be dependent on the services that the digital network provides
Gordon Brown
The report called for everyone in the UK to have access to a broadband speed of up to two megabits per second (Mbps).
This would make internet connections capable of handling much more video and sites that offer greater interactivity.
By the time of the final report, the government will know whether internet service providers (ISPs) can build next generation networks themselves or if government help will be needed.
Parental control
Mr Burnham said that he wanted to ensure public services online were accessible to the widest range of people and wanted to "give parents the information and tools to protect [their] children from inappropriate content".
But opposition politicians said they were disappointed in the report.

Shadow culture minister Jeremy Hunt told BBC News it consisted of little more than promises to make more reports.
"We're very disappointed. We thought the report was going to contain a strategy. David Cameron has said the majority of the population should have access to high-speed broadband in five years. Instead they [the government] have announced another review.
"In France and Germany they are laying fibre, in Japan they already have it. In Britain the average broadband speed is 3.6Mbps so what he [Andy Burnham] is talking about is getting half the current speed," he added.
"We're the second largest exporter of music and television and third for film. But when it comes to the distribution of digital content, we're lagging".
The report also looked at the issue of internet piracy. Mr Burnham said the government would look at setting up a new digital rights agency and wanted to introduce legislation requiring internet service providers to notify illegal file-sharers directly about their activity.

Mr Burnham also examined the role Channel 4 would play in the future of public service broadcasting.
"The report identifies news at local, regional and national level and children's programming as amongst the key priorities," he said.
"The BBC - as an enabling force is central to this - strong and secure in its own future, working in partnership with others to deliver these objectives.
"We will also explore how we can establish a sustainable public service organisation which offers scale and reach alongside the BBC, building on the strength of Channel 4."
Communications watchdog Ofcom last week warned Channel 4 faced a bleak future unless a deal could be reached.
The Liberal Democrats said the minister had failed to live up to his promises.
Speaking to the BBC, the Lib Dem's culture, media and sport spokesman, Don Foster, said the report was "bitterly disappointing".
"In September, the minister said... 'Early in the New Year, Ofcom can conclude its review and the government can announce decisions and the process to implement those decisions'. But we have no decision," he said.
"He failed to rule out top slicing. He welcomed discussion between ITV and the BBC, between Channel 4 and the BBC, but no decision.
"We've spent lots of money on reviews, but all we now have is a strategy group, an umbrella body, a delivery group, a rights agency, a exploratory review, a digital champion and an expert task force.
"This report has been a complete damp squib."
Future radio
The report also examined the future of radio. The culture secretary said digital audio broadcasting (DAB) will become the "primary distribution network", potentially giving notice for the end of traditional FM analogue radio.
The government will also look at how the digital switch-over scheme - introduced for TV - could be expanded to help the radio transition.
The prime minister, speaking at the New Local Government Network in central London, said that the digital economy would play a crucial part in lifting Britain out of recession.
"Today we have an interim report from Lord Carter setting out the scale of our ambition to compete in the digital economy and that's a market worth about �50bn a year," he said.
"It affects every community in our country who are looking for the best digital infrastructure, access to broadband, that we can offer them.
"We know that every aspect of our lives in local communities - every school, every hospital, every workplace and even every home - will be dependent on the services that the digital network provides."

Police miscount serious violence
Violent crime - including knife crime - is increasing, say the new figures
A number of police forces in England and Wales have been undercounting some of the most serious violent crimes, the government has admitted.
It means figures for serious violent crimes rose by 22% compared to last year - rather than showing a fall as previous figures appeared to indicate.
The mistake happened when some crimes classed as "grievous bodily harm with intent" were recorded as less serious.
Figures say overall crime is down, and ministers say these can be trusted.
The government says it does not know how long the undercounting has been going on - leading to concerns that figures on violent crime may have been wrong for up to a decade.
A former Home Office crime consultant told the BBC the government had been "hiding behind" its changes in the crime counting rules.
Professor Marian Fitzgerald, a criminologist at the University of Kent's Crime and Justice Centre, said the long-term trend of increasing violent crime was now "catching up" with the government.
Let's be clear, this isn't crime that wasn't being recorded or wasn't being reported or wasn't being dealt with
Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary
The Conservatives said the new figures "fatally undermined" government claims that violent crime was in decline.
Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve said: "They betray a government that is completely out of touch with what is going on, on our streets and in our communities."
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne called for the Office of National Statistics - rather than the Home Office - to be given direct responsibility for crime figures.
But police minister Vernon Coaker said the "clarification" did not mean the government had lost faith in its crime statistics.
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith insisted all the crimes in question had been investigated by the police.
She told the BBC: "What the statisticians are clear about is that the increases in the most serious forms of violence have actually in terms of numbers been more than counteracted by the decreases in less serious violence."
FORCES WHICH RECOUNTED SERIOUS VIOLENCE
Humberside
Derbyshire
Cleveland Police
North Wales
Cambridgeshire
Thames Valley 18 forces overall reported higher levels of serious violence
13 including above reported back
Metropolitan Police said it could not meet deadline
An 'almighty embarrassment'
The error was discovered when at least 18 out of 43 forces in England and Wales were asked to re-examine their figures, following the realisation that some serious assaults were being recorded in a lower category of offence.
Crimes of "grievous bodily harm with intent" committed between April and June this year were being mistakenly recorded as lesser crimes.
When the figures were recounted using the correct classification, the official total showed serious violent crime had risen 22%.
Previous measures under the old rules had shown decreases every quarter of up to 15%.

Two of the most serious categories of knife crime showed big increases.
Attempted murders in England and Wales involving a knife between April and June this year were 28% up on last year.
And assaults causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent rose by 29%.
However, the revised figures still show that overall crime and overall violent crime remain down on last year - a finding backed by the results of the British Crime Survey (BCS), also released on Thursday.
The BCS, which is a study of the experiences of victims, rather than police records, shows an overall decrease of 6% in the number of crimes compared to last year.
Alcohol-fueled violence
The Home Office has refused to name the police forces asked to resubmit their crime figures.
At least one of the 13 forces which complied - North Wales Police - said its crime figures were subsequently "audited, verified and found to be correct."
However experts say that other forces who did not submit figures, may have been making the same mistake.
Among them is the Metropolitan Police who has now confirmed a 44% increase in offences of GBH with Intent offences between April and June this year.
On Thursday the Met confirmed it would suspend issuing figures on serious crime until it had worked out the best way of presenting them.
Keith Bristow, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, said "most, if not all" police forces in England and Wales, plus British Transport Police, were to some extent misinterpreting the guidance on recording grievous bodily harm with intent.
Police figures are reflecting a long term trend increase in serious violence and the government are hiding behind changes in the counting rules to try to explain it away
Professor Marian Fitzgerald
How police missed the violence
The government started to realise it had got its figures wrong earlier this year after Home Office clarified the guidance on crime reporting.
Home Office statisticians discovered that 18 forces, were showing "above average" increases in GBH with intent.
That suggested that they were the ones which had been misinterpreting the guidance the most.
Of these 18 forces, 13 were able to provide further information on their figures to the Home Office.
The types of offence that have been miscounted would include serious alcohol-fuelled violence where the attacker had intended serious harm - but the victim escaped significant injury.
Ms Smith said: "Let's be clear, this isn't crime that wasn't being recorded or wasn't being reported or wasn't being dealt with. It just wasn't being recorded in the category 'most serious violence'.
"So all of this crime has been dealt with."
CRIMES AFFECTED BY MISCOUNT
Grievous Bodily Harm "with intent":
Where attacker wants to inflict serious injury
Incidents include serious pub-fights, use of broken bottles etc
Problem arose where victim escaped with minor or no injuries
Some officers previously classed these attacks as lesser assaults, but should have classed them as serious
Majority of forces correctly classified these incidents, but a minority did not

But Professor Fitzgerald said that the government was aware of the long trend of serious violent crime which had been rising over "several decades"
She told the BBC: "It started to go up really quite steeply from the early 1990s.
"The problem this government has got is that when it came to power it dismissed out of hand the trends in police recorded crime which were a fairly good measure of serious violence
"It preferred instead to rely on the British Crime Survey which is very poor at picking up violence."
For good measure it has actually interfered with the police figures by keeping changing the ways in which they have been recorded.
"What's catching up with them now is the fact the police figures are reflecting that long term trend increase in serious violence. The government are hiding behind changes in the counting rules to try to explain it away."

Immigration 'harming communities'
The committee said the government had to do more to address concerns
Rapid immigration has damaged community relations in parts of England, a report by the Commons communities and local government committee says. In three areas with high immigration - Peterborough, Burnley, and Barking and Dagenham - community cohesion is among the lowest in the country, the MPs say.
The report said there was "significant public anxiety" over issues such as pressure on public services.
Ministers said action was being taken to minimise the impact of immigration.
'Flawed data'
In their report, Community Cohesion and Migration, the MPs say many migrants make "significant contributions" to local communities - working in the NHS or other public services.
But it said there was "significant public anxiety" in some areas about immigration, which it warned "cannot simply be dismissed as expressions of racist or xenophobic sentiments".
Some concerns arose from "practical concerns" - such as overcrowded accommodation and pressure on public services - such as sharp rises in the numbers of primary school children who do not speak English well.
We do think it is right that newcomers are asked to pay a little bit more for public services
Liam ByrneImmigration minister
In the three areas visited, community cohesion - measured by how many people believe those from different backgrounds get along - is among the lowest in England, the report said.
It said public services were under pressure because government funding was being based on "flawed population data". The committee criticised plans for a levy on migrants' normal visa fees to help fund public services like policing which it said were likely to generate "very little" money.
Press reports suggest it could be only �15m, something the committee says would be "a drop in the ocean".
'Additional pressures'
Immigration Minister Liam Byrne said: "We do think it is right that newcomers are asked to pay a little bit more for public services.
"Actually we propose that the fund should raise tens of millions of pounds every year.
"This vital cash will allow us to channel money quickly to public services wherever there is a short term pressure from migration."
We're risking turning everything that migrants do into a problem and forgetting that they are dynamically contributing to the local economy Dr Dhananjayan SriskandarajahIPPR
But the committee said it might be unfair, as not all immigrants would pay into the fund. EU citizens and anyone moving within the UK would not have to pay.
Instead the government should "immediately establish a contingency fund capable of responding effectively to the additional pressures which may be put on local government services from migration".
'Negative conclusion'
The Local Government Association has repeatedly called for a �250m contingency fund to be made available for under-pressure councils.
But Dr Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah, of the Institute of Public Policy Research, said he was disappointed by the committee's "negative conclusion". "We're risking turning everything that migrants do into a problem and forgetting that they are dynamically contributing to the local economy and to the country because they are working and paying taxes," he said.
He said only better population figures and a funding system that could respond quickly would "solve the challenges".
For the Conservatives, shadow minister Baroness Warsi said the report was an "indictment" of the problems caused by the government's "failure to control the numbers of migrants coming into this country" and by their "inability to know where migrants are living and to fund local authorities accordingly".
The Conservatives say it shows annual limits on economic migration are needed to ensure communities and public services can cope.
A spokesperson for the Department for Communities and Local Government said the government was already taking action to manage migration to "maximise the benefits and minimise the impacts". These included a �50m "cohesion fund" to support councils and extra funding to help manage the "transitional impacts" of migration - such as �10m as for schools experiencing increases in pupil numbers.
