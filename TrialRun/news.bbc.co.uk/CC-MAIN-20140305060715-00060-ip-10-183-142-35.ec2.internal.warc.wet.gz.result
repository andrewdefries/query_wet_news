Japan's earthquake watch
Japan holds regular earthquake drills
Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, perched on top of several converging tectonic plates. Geological instability causes around 1,000 tremors in the country each year, although many of these go undetected by the public.
Every time they do strike they are a reminder to the country's capital, Tokyo, that it is long overdue "a Big One". The last major quake in the city was in 1923, and records suggest the geologically precarious Kanto region - where Tokyo in located - will experience one of a similar size about every 70 years.
The 1923 quake, known as the Great Kanto Earthquake, killed more than 100,000 people. Although building and safety standards have greatly improved since then, experts predict that a major quake in the capital could still kill several thousand people and shake the world's financial markets.
But Tokyo is not the only Japanese city at risk. The 1995 quake in Kobe, western Japan, jolted those who had been focusing quake prevention efforts only on the Kanto area. The Great Hanshin Earthquake killed more than 6,400 people and injured more than 400,000 and was the most powerful tremor in the country since 1923.
The devastation wreaked by an earthquake is not simply connected to its strength. A tremor of magnitude 8 hit northern Japan last September - the strongest anywhere in the world in recent years. But because its epicentre was far offshore, and because the quake hit hardest in under-populated areas, it caused no fatalities and only seriously injured a handful of people.
Likewise, the first of a string of quakes to shake Niigata this weekend was a sizeable 6.8 magnitude. These tremors killed at least 25 people, but deaths could have run into the thousands if their focus had been in a built-up area - Niigata is largely rural.
The 1995 Kobe quake was only slightly stronger. But it was so devastating because its epicentre was only 20km from a city of 1.5 million people.
Annual drill
The urban density of Tokyo - home to more than 12 million people crammed into an area of just over 2,000 sq-km - therefore puts it at great risk.
A government earthquake panel said in August that there was a 70% chance of a quake around magnitude 7 hitting Tokyo in the next 30 years. The city government has predicted a quake measuring 7.2 could kill more than 7,000 people and injure around 160,000.
Another major factor in determining the death toll is timing. Experts say many more people would have died in the Kobe quake if it had been later in the day - it struck at dawn, before most people were using cars or public transport. Fires also pose a major risk after quakes
It could also be argued, however, that a quake that strikes while people are sleeping puts them at greater risk of collapsing buildings and ensuring fires. Fires killed the majority of victims in the Great Kanto Earthquake.
Because of its geological vulnerability, the Japanese authorities make every effort to prepare for a major earthquake.
New buildings are designed to withstand the strongest tremors and the army and emergency services go through elaborate drills every year, on the anniversary of the Great Kanto earthquake. The difficulty lies with older buildings. A 1997 report by Tokyo's government showed that more than 1.6m houses in the capital were built before 1981, when new recommendations for quake-proofing came into force. The local government offers all of the city's citizens a structural health check on their homes.
But engineering work to strengthen them is not cheap, and not everyone can afford it.

Scooby takes US box office lead
Scooby and colleagues have returned for a sequel The second Scooby-Doo movie has gone to the top of the North American box office charts with takings of more than $30m (�16m) in its opening weekend. Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, based on the hit cartoon series, took less than its predecessor, which made $54m (�29m) in summer 2002.
The film stars Freddie Prinze Jr and Sarah Michelle Gellar as crime-fighting friends of cowardly dog Scooby-Doo.
Tom Hanks comedy The Ladykillers opened in second place with $13m (�7m).
Dawn of the Dead has slipped from the top spot
The movie - a remake of the 1955 British heist comedy starring Alec Guinness - set a new opening record for writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen.
Their previous best had been Intolerable Cruelty which opened to $12.5m (�6.8m) last year.
Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ slipped a place to three with $12.5m. With takings of $315m (�171m) after five weeks, it is on course to outpace The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, which has earned about $375m (�204m). Last weekend's number one, the zombie horror remake Dawn of the Dead, fell to fourth with $10.4m (�5.6m), taking its 10-day total to $43.9m (�24m). Ben Affleck rebounded from the infamous failure of Gigli to open at five with the romance Jersey Girl in which he plays a widowed publicist with a young daughter.

Egypt jails gay youth
The trial of the other defendants is continuing
In a trial that has attracted international attention, an Egyptian court has sentenced a young man to three years in prison for debauchery.
The youth, reported to be 15 years old, was found guilty of "practising sexual immorality". He is one of 52 men arrested in May during a raid on a floating nightclub on the Nile. Two of the main defendants are also facing charges of forming an extremist group and denigrating Islam.
The case has been criticised by human rights groups who said the men were subjected to examinations to see if they had engaged in homosexual acts. The men were arrested at a floating nightclub Although homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt, it is a major cultural and social taboo. The young man was tried in a different court because of his age and will serve his sentence in a prison for young offenders, court officials said.
The trial of the other defendants, in the state security court where verdicts cannot be appealed, is expected to continue this week. All have pleaded not guilty.
Their names and some of their addresses have been published in Egyptian newspapers. And defence lawyers say the press has already convicted them by publishing lurid and false accounts of gay orgies on board the boat, where most of the men were detained.

More names on Iraq election ban
An Iraqi woman looks at a leaked list of candidates banned from running
Iraq's election commission chief has said more candidates are likely to be banned from running in parliamentary elections on 7 March.A committee has already barred more than 500 candidates. Commission chief Faraj al-Haidari said the number of Sunni and Shia candidates on the list is roughly equal. The disqualifications have caused a political storm. US Vice-President Joe Biden is set to arrive in Iraq to try and ease tensions. Mr Haidari said the additional names could include people with criminal records and former military personnel who allegedly used forged documents. On Thursday Iraq's President Jalal Talabani asked the country's Supreme Court to decide whether the disqualifications were legal, as they have not been approved by parliament. The decision was made by the Accountability and Justice Commission, a body responsible for ensuring the Baath party, once led by Saddam Hussein, does not make a comeback in Iraqi politics. Some candidates have been banned for alleged ties to the Baath party. An official list of those barred has not been published but leaked reports suggest it includes several prominent Sunni Arab politicians. Some question the motive for the disqualifications and fear it will stoke up sectarian tensions. Many Sunni Arabs boycotted the last parliamentary election in 2005. The 7 March election is regarded as a crucial test for Iraq's national reconciliation process and ahead of a planned US military withdrawal in stages.

Prison numbers reach record high
The overall figure is up for men and the 18-20s, but down for women
The prison population has grown to a record high of nearly 84,000 in England and Wales - up 66% since 1995.Statistics from the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) show the population in custody on 30 June numbered 83,900, a rise of 220 from a year earlier. This was despite more than 60,000 inmates benefiting from an early release scheme introduced in June 2007. The Howard League for Penal Reform said overcrowded, squalid prison conditions lead to rioting, violence and chaos. Director Frances Crook said: "As the prison population reaches an all-time high, it is more important than ever to address our failing penal policy. "Every week we cram hundreds more prisoners into our already bulging jails."
Releasing prisoners early put the public at risk
Dominic Grieve, Shadow justice secretary
She said prisons were awash with drugs, violence and arson and that the government would inflict this on local communities by building more prisons. "The answer to rising prison populations is not to build more failing jails," she added. Tougher sentencing on conviction or when prisoners breached their early release conditions has caused the population increase, according to the MoJ. Figures for the year to the end of June showed: An increase in the number of "lifers" and those doing time for violent and sexual offences Falls in the numbers sent down for motoring offences (down 230 - 17%), theft and handling (down 450 - 12%) and fraud and forgery (down 150 - 7%) There were 9,800 prisoners aged 18 to 20 - up 2% The number of men in custody rose, while the female population dropped 5% to 4,300. More than 10% of the total population (8,900 - up 2%) was awaiting trial Foreign nationals made up 11,400 of those in detention, including people awaiting deportation. Two years ago, faced with spiralling prison numbers, the government introduced an early release system allowing prisoners to be freed up to 18 days before they were due. Former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, criticised the scheme, saying it undermined public confidence in the criminal justice system. Since then, more than 60,000 prisoners have been released early, with 963 alleged to have gone on to commit further nearly 1,300 offences. 'Limited impact'Some 190 also went on the run after being recalled to prison for failing to honour the terms of their release. But a separate MoJ report said it had "limited impact" because it affected only those serving sentences of under four years. "The population rose a further 5,900 [between 2005 and 2009] due to lagged effect of previous large increases of offenders on longer sentences," it added. Shadow justice secretary Dominic Grieve said: "Releasing prisoners early put the public at risk. "In the next year the number of prisoners released early could rise to almost 100,000. A Conservative government will scrap this disastrous policy," he added. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

1968: Powell slates immigration policy
The Conservative right-winger Enoch Powell has made a hard-hitting speech attacking the government's immigration policy. Addressing a Conservative association meeting in Birmingham, Mr Powell said Britain had to be mad to allow in 50,000 dependents of immigrants each year. He compared it to watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre. The MP for Wolverhampton South West called for an immediate reduction in immigration and the implementation of a Conservative policy of "urgent" encouragement of those already in the UK to return home. "It can be no part of any policy that existing families should be kept divided. But there are two directions on which families can be reunited," he said. "Like the Roman, I seem to see the river Tiber foaming with much blood"
Enoch Powell Mr Powell compared enacting legislation such as the Race Relations Bill to "throwing a match on to gunpowder". He said that as he looked to the future he was filled with a sense of foreboding. "Like the Roman, I seem to see the river Tiber foaming with much blood," he said. He estimated that by the year 2000 up to seven million people - or one in ten of the population - would be of immigrant descent. Mr Powell, the shadow defence spokesman, was applauded during and after his 45-mintue speech. However, it is likely his comments will be less warmly received by the Conservative party leader, Edward Heath.

GB judo team struggles at Euros
Great Britain's judo competitors finished out of the medals at the European Championships in Lisbon.
Peter Cousins, who won silver at last year's World Championships, finished fifth in the men's -100kg category, which was won by Holland's Henk Grol. In the women's competition, Edinburgh 30-year-old Sarah Clark was also fifth, this time in the -63kg category. There were also fifth-placed finishes in Portugal for Georgina Singleton (-53kg) and Sarah Adlington (+78kg).
The tournament in Lisbon was the final event in the European qualification process for the Beijing Olympics in August.

We will be judged on what happens on the mat in Beijing in August
GB team member Euan Burton
And despite failing to win medals in Lisbon, Clark, Craig Fallon (-60kg), Winston Gordon (-90kg) and Michelle Rogers (-78kg) all booked Olympic places for Britain in their weight categories.
It means Britain will have seven judoka in Beijing - the same number that qualified for Athens four years ago.
Cousins, Euan Burton (-81kg) and Karina Bryant (+78 kg) had already secured places for GB at last year's world championships. The team line-up for Beijing will be announced next week.
