Why bad news lifted France Telecom's shares
Analysis
By Jorn Madslien
BBC News Online business staff
Shares in deeply indebted France Telecom have spent the best part of a week defying gravity.
The stock has soared by one-third in five days, even though analysts and credit agencies have been doing their utmost to rubbish the company's outlook.
Not only have they raised further concerns about the group's ability to service its debts, they have also labelled its shares as little more than "junk investment".
Yet Friday's downgrade by the ratings agency Fitch - which came soon after similar moves by its rivals Moody's and Standard & Poor's - failed to spook investors, who instead appeared to be encouraged by the gloom.
Bailout bets
By Friday, it seemed that every bit of bad news released during the week had sparked yet another jump in France Telecom's share price.
For the casual observer, such celebration of gloom may seem totally out of character.
But there is a simple explanation for France Telecom's rise, from about 10 euros on Monday to almost 15 euros on Friday.
Investors have simply been placing speculative bets on France Telecom's failure in the hope that its majority owner, the French government, will step in to help.
According to this way of thinking, bad news was, in fact, good news.
"The group is in a liquidity crisis and can no longer get any money from the bond market," reasoned one credit analyst.
"It can't get itself out of its predicament without government help.
"So when push comes to shove I'm pretty confident the state will step in."
Value lost
At the heart of France Telecom's crisis lies its massive debt burden of about 61bn euros.
In recent weeks, analysts have stoked investors' fears by suggesting that the debts might well rise further if its part-owned subsidiary MobilCom fails to retain its feeble grip on the German market.
A loud brawl with MobilCom, and disappointing performance by France Telecom's mobile phone subsidiary Orange, have further weighed on investors' sentiment, as has the price it paid for third generation mobile phone licences.
Consequently, France Telecom's shares lost 70% of their value during the first six months of this year.
Everybody wins?
According to France Telecom chairman Michel Bon, speculators taking bets on lower share prices have caused much of this year's fall.
And it seems this week was the time when they decided to change their strategy.
"The rise in the share is speculative," said one trader.
"The stock had fallen to a ridiculous level and enough people believe in this talk about state support to lift it.
"The banks are spreading the talk around as well to try and make a bit of money."
Even the government, which owns 55% of France Telecom, has benefited as the rumour-mill has propelled the stock higher.
Renationalisation
The rally in France Telecom shares begun on Monday when a spokesman suggested that the company might renationalise the group sparked a frantic buying spree.
Repeated denials from the government did little to change traders' sentiment.
"A renationalisation was never really possible but the market still believed it," said one trader.
"Even if we know the EU will block most options for state help, everyone is still convinced [the government] is preparing something."
That something could be revealed soon if the rumour mill is to be believed.
It could come as a direct government loan, it could be a fresh government guarantee, or it could be a new government-backed bond issue which would help France Telecom refinance its debts, traders speculated.
And unless their optimism is tempered during the weekend, such hopes could well push the shares even higher when trading resumes on Monday.

Jackson gives up Neverland ranch
Neverland was refinanced in March to save it from being auctioned off
Pop star Michael Jackson has lost ownership of his Neverland ranch in California after transferring the deeds to a company he has a share in.
Earlier this week, Jackson, 50, filed legal papers making the Sycamore Valley Ranch Company the new owner.
The company is linked to investment firm Colony Capital, which bailed the singer out in March when he owed $24.5m (�16m) on the property.
When it bought the debt, Neverland was a week away from being auctioned off.
The refinancing deal had meant that Jackson could keep the sprawling property.
Jackson, whose huge catalogue of hit records includes Billie Jean, Thriller and Man in the Mirror, has not lived at Neverland since he was acquitted of child molestation charges in 2005.
Fantasy land
It is not clear what will now happen to the property, which he bought in 1987.
The property, which Jackson aimed to turn into a fantasy land, is named after an island in the story Peter Pan, where children never grow up.
He built a zoo and fairground on the 2,800 acre (1,100 hectare) property which is north west of Santa Barbara.
It was closed in 2006 after Jackson failed to pay his staff or maintain proper insurance.

Spain thanks UK for advice on Eta
Eta announced a permanent ceasefire in March
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has thanked British leader Tony Blair for his guidance on the peace process in the Basque region.
Mr Zapatero said Mr Blair had given him advice based on his experience in the peace process in Northern Ireland.
Mr Blair said ending conflict was a "difficult and complicated process".
Spain's government has been attacked by the opposition Popular Party (PP) for offering talks with Basque separatists Eta, who declared a ceasefire in March.
Correspondents say that Mr Zapatero's very public display of gratitude will be seen in Spain as a rebuke to the PP for withholding support from the talks.
Despite the announcement of a permanent ceasefire, Eta said last month that it would not give up its weapons until it was independent of Spain.
Mr Zapatero's government has said it will hold talks with Eta but has ruled out granting the Basques in north-western Spain full independence.
'Patient determination'
After talks in Madrid, Mr Zapatero said he wanted to thank Mr Blair "publicly for his government's support to our government in this difficult process".
"We have been talking about the peace process in the Basque country and I have heard a lot about the peace process in Northern Ireland," Mr Zapatero said.
Mr Blair said "patient determination" was vital for the peace process to succeed.
"There will be ups and downs on the way," he said.
The two men are also said to have discussed tackling illegal immigration into Europe.
The British leader has been credited with helping set up a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland.
The Irish Republican Army announced in 2005 that it had put its weapons "beyond use".
More than 800 people have been killed since Eta took up arms in 1968.

The best public services in the world
By Sumant Bhatia
Read Keeping Cuba healthy
Watch the report
Newsnight's quest to find the Best Public Services in the World began with John Harris' report from Cuba on Monday. Our next film looks at Portland, Oregon in the US, where they are turning their back on the beloved American car and ploughing money into public transport - cycle lanes an' all.
Viewers had already written in with their own suggestions and indeed Cuba did figure, with mostly positive comments about the way it trains its doctors and offers free treatment. I'm sure that Fidel Castro agrees at the moment.
As several people pointed out, the richer the nation the better its services are in general, so a special mention goes to nominations from emerging nations on top of Cuba, such as Venezuela. Alwyn Lloyd Simpson in London noted its services "are maintained for and on behalf of the public and no ambiguity". India too gets a mention. Pete H in Manchester nominated its vast railway system: "the trains are not affected by leaves on the line or excessive sunshine".
Tommy Payne of Manchester also gave a glowing reference to China's law and order system. "I was extremely surprised to have my stolen mobile returned to me twice," he writes, "while a Chinese friend of mine had his camera returned to him, together with compensation from the person who took it, nearly one year after it had been taken!"
Good service
Overall the obvious countries garnered the most votes, with Scandinavia, Japan, Australia, Germany and Singapore recommended in most categories. The best of course depends on your definition of good services. Graeme Reid of Middlesex has a more "free market" viewpoint when he says "you will never find a government-run service ever consistently out-perform a commercially-run operation." YOUR NOMINATIONS
General
Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Cuba, Germany, Luxembourg, Monaco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, UK, US, Venezuela and all Scandinavian countries
Education
Denmark, Finland, Japan, US, UK (tertiary)
Health
Belgium, Cuba, Denmark, France, Greece, Israel, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, UK
Law and order
China, Japan, Singapore, US
Transport
Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland
Welfare
Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, US
Nominate your best
Many of you disagree, pointing out that private intervention in public services is un-warranted and divisive, especially in the United Kingdom. Yet Mike Evans from Bath gave Singapore his vote for its mixture of public and private provision, and its individual welfare accounts which can be handed on to future generations.
NHS
Nicky Wilson in London is positive about the National Health Service: "not the most luxurious, but it is in the top 3 for efficiency." Richard Gladding in Matsue, Japan, says his adopted country goes one better, with citizens paying "a similar percentage of their GDP on healthcare as the UK does, yet the level of service is outstanding." Indeed those often-used management words "efficiency" and "effectiveness" are cited by Rohit Handa as the reason he puts Scandinavian services top.
The biggest ringing endorsement of a service comes from Bertie Johnston, who lives in Belgium and says friends decided to retire there because of the quality of its healthcare. Nick Tiliopoulis from Edinburgh had positive experiences while using Greek doctors and clinics, and Nick Vivian swears by the healthcare in Taiwan, where he's living at the moment. "I have national health insurance which costs me �10 a month and allows me to see a doctor at a clinic, a specialist at a hospital or even a dentist! No queues either", he says.
Paying for it
Where next in Newsnight's quest for the best public services?
The United States comes in for equal praise and protestations. Ex-pat Kevin Cromarty in Tampa Florida found almost all services better in the UK, as they were cheaper. Yet Maria Johnson in London, among others, is a big fan of the US justice system, saying its "more harsh regime is effective". Personally I would like to nominate Luxembourg (along with Monica Crown in Como, Italy), where I spent a very nice weekend recently. My cousin's wife (who works for a US bank) has just given birth: now she'll receive extremely generous welfare payments while she cares for baby Benjamin! Her sister is even more fortunate: having recently started a government job as a care worker, she's now on paid leave, as she's two months pregnant: rules there mean state employees can't work in such a condition. However the Luxembourg Government is now in deficit and some benefits may have to be cut, or taxes rise. And that's the gist of the argument: just how much are we willing to pay to have the best public services in the world?

India's key new ministers
India's new cabinet has 79 members and includes Congress party veterans, rising stars and some important coalition allies. BBC News profiles key ministers.
MANMOHAN SINGH, prime minister
The Indian prime minister, often derided by the main opposition BJP as weak, stunned his critics when he led the Congress party to a decisive victory in the elections. Mr Singh has a strengthened mandate
Widely regarded as the architect of the country's economic reforms, he is seen by many as the best man to lead India in times of global economic recession. A studious former academic and bureaucrat, Mr Singh keeps a low profile and is viewed as perhaps the cleanest politician in India. Mr Singh became India's first Sikh prime minister after Congress leader Sonia Gandhi turned the post down in 2004. A major foreign policy triumph during his first term was to bring India out of nuclear isolation by signing a landmark deal with the US. Mr Singh has never won a popular election - he has always been a member of the upper house - but many Indians respect him for his integrity and intelligence. PRANAB MUKHERJEE, finance minister
Former foreign - and now finance - minister, Pranab Mukherjee is the Congress party's man for all seasons. He is an accomplished politician whose popularity cuts across party lines. And that makes him invaluable when it comes to negotiating with tricky and temperamental political allies. Mr Mukherjee's popularity cuts across party lines
In the twilight months of the last government, he also held the finance portfolio. Although he has been an MP in the upper house of parliament for the past four decades, he won a seat in the lower house for the first time in 2004. Besides the foreign ministry, Mr Mukherjee has also served as finance minister, defence minister and industry minister at various times in the past. The diminutive politician enjoys great stature - his loyalty and competence have endeared him to Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. PALANIAPPAN CHIDAMBARAM, home minister The suave, articulate politician from southern Tamil Nadu state has had successful stints at the finance ministry and home ministry, where he remains. Mr Chidambaram is known for his efficiency
The Harvard-educated lawyer spent the first four years of the last government as finance minister, overseeing a period of rapid economic growth. Mr Chidambaram is a firm believer in free trade and is known for his daring scheme to halt tax evasion. He is well known for his pro-market reforms and for his bold steps to abolish red tape. His reputation for efficiency resulted in him being appointed the home minister after the deadly Mumbai (Bombay) attacks in November 2008. His critics accuse him of being arrogant and say he lacks the ability to reach out to party cadres, perhaps a reason why he came close to losing the recent election. In the end, he won with a small margin of about 3,500 votes. SM KRISHNA, foreign minister
Mr Krishna is a member of the Rajya upper house from the southern state of Karnataka. SM Krishna aims to boost ties with neighbours
An old Congress party hand, he has served as junior minister for industry and finance in the past. He has also been the chief minister of Karnataka and served as the governor of Maharashtra. A Fulbright scholar, Mr Krishna is credited with the growth of the IT industry in Bangalore. He is also an avid sportsperson who plays tennis regularly. In his first press conference after taking over as external affairs minister, Mr Krishna said the new government's priority was to improve ties with its neighbours and consolidate strategic partnerships with the US, Russia, China, Japan and the European Union. AK ANTONY, defence minister
Senior Congress party leader AK Antony was Mr Singh's defence minister in the last government too. Before that he was a three-time chief minister of the southern state of Kerala. Mr Antony is popular with the army
The 68-year-old is known for his clean image. According to reports, he would cancel defence contracts at the whiff of controversy. Analysts say during his tenure, violence in Kashmir reduced considerably and his policies have made him popular with the army. As defence minister, he toured most forward areas including the Siachen glacier - often described as the highest battlefield in the world - and came up with measures to improve the living conditions of soldiers. But critics say he delayed the purchase of equipment for the armed forces, affecting their battlefield capability. SHARAD PAWAR, agriculture minister
Sharad Pawar leads the Nationalist Congress Party. He is one of the few politicians with support from parties across regions and ideologies. He was brought into the Congress party by former PM Rajiv Gandhi. And in 1991, he became defence minister under Narasimha Rao. Sharad Pawar - seen by many as ruthless and ambitious
In 1999, he split from Congress over Sonia Gandhi's Italian roots. But five years later he was back with his old ally, entering the governing United Progressive Alliance (UPA) on the eve of the 2004 polls. Not trusted by many in India's political class, Mr Pawar is known to be ruthless and ambitious. As political parties negotiated ahead of the recent elections, Mr Pawar's supporters floated his name as a prime ministerial candidate. But with Congress getting a decisive mandate in the elections, Mr Pawar will have to content himself with a ministry for the moment. MAMATA BANERJEE, railways minister
Will Mamata Banerjee give sleepless nights to Manmohan Singh? That's a question many in India are asking as the mercurial chief of the regional Trinamul Congress Party drives a hard bargain for ministerial posts for her 19 MPs. Ms Banerjee has a reputation for being temperamental
Ms Banerjee's success is an indication of the waning popularity of the communists in the state of West Bengal. Exactly three years ago, her party seemed to be a spent political force and she was considered something of a "political oddball". But in the past couple of years, she has steadily made inroads into the leftists' territory. She has led successful campaigns against the state government's initiative to acquire vast tracts of agricultural land in Singur and Nandigram in south Bengal for the car and chemicals industries respectively. Both projects were withdrawn in the face of resistance. Taking up the issues of small farmers, Ms Banerjee became a cheerleader for Bengal's rural poor. However, her relationship with the Congress is expected to be stormy. Soon after the elections, she said she wanted early assembly elections in West Bengal, a demand Congress may not be able, or willing, to grant.

Shoot-to-kill policy under debate
By Dominic Casciani
BBC News
Shooters: Officers C2 and C12 looking for their suspect
The police watchdog report into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes has shone a light onto controversial "shoot-to-kill" tactics for dealing with suicide bombers - but what role did they play on the day he was killed?
When the men responsible for the 2004 Madrid train bombings blew themselves up as police closed in, taking with them an entire apartment block, it was the clearest possible signal that tactics to apprehend major terrorism suspects needed to be radically different from those employed during normal policing procedures. Faced with such a threat, how are police officers supposed to act to protect themselves and the public? That is the issue at the heart of Operation Kratos, the suicide bomber tactics, that the Independent Police Complaints Commission wants us to debate two years on from the death of Jean Charles de Menezes. The Brazilian electrician died when two specialist firearms officers shot him seven times as he sat on a London Tube train on 22 July 2005. They thought he was a suicide bomber who had to be stopped at all costs. But the Kratos strategy had not been activated that morning - no codeword had been given for them to fire on its terms. Critical shot
Kratos is commonly thought of as a shoot-to-kill policy. The reality is that Kratos is less a policy and more a series of critical linked tactics that operationally underline the severity of the operation. Kratos includes three key elements: A "directed shot" - an order to shoot from an operations commander A critical shot to the head to instantly incapacitate, almost inevitably killing A lack of warning because a suicide bomber may detonate Kratos tactics must be sanctioned by a "Designated Senior Officer" (DSO) - a senior commander with specialist training. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick was the DSO on the day that Mr de Menezes died - but at no point did she give the Kratos codeword. How it happened: the death of Jean Charles de Menezes
Where the confusion arises, say investigators, is that each element of Kratos already appears in the main firearms policies. Take a directed shot, for instance. Armed teams are often at the end of a long chain and may know very little about the people they are confronting.
This means that commanders across all the detail of an operation must have the authority to order an officer to shoot if they believe it is necessary. Then there is a second separate strategy for dealing with a suspected suicide bomber targeting a major public event, such as the Trooping of the Colour. In this case, a commander has the authority to order a sniper to fire without warning from a hidden position. The debating point, say investigators, is whether bringing key elements together under the Kratos umbrella, and the psychological and operational impact that has in a fast-moving crisis, makes it more likely that someone was going to get shot. Some critics fear the very existence of Kratos in its current format creates an air of inevitability. Pumped up During the trial of the Met Police for breaching health and safety laws, the jury heard that on 22 July 2005 firearms teams were psychologically pumped up for a life-or-death confrontation with a suicide bomber. The officers took 124-grain ammunition - a form of "dum dum" bullet designed to kill more swiftly - critical to stopping a bomber in his tracks. But at the same time, officers had different views of their operational parameters. Mr de Menezes was followed to Stockwell station and shot dead
The two officers who shot Mr de Menezes, codenamed C2 and C12, had taken authority to make a "hard stop" of the suspect - but at the same time they did not believe Kratos had been sanctioned.
But another detective superintendent in Scotland Yard's Room 1600 operational control told the IPPC that he had heard Cmdr Dick say the "male must not be allowed to get on a train at all costs". Firearms officers C11 and C6 interpreted this as an instruction from the DSO. Another, C6, told the IPCC he had believed he might have had to shoot the target to stop him killing members of the public and himself. William, an armed officer close to the killing but not involved, believed he had been involved in a Kratos incident. Vic, another armed officer, explained how he had interpreted orders from Trojan 84, a key superior. "The tone of voice and urgency of this radio transmission, combined with the intelligence meant to me that he must be stopped immediately and at any cost. I believed that a bombing of the Tube could be imminent and must be prevented."

IPCC report recommendationsSend us your comments
What this comes down to, say investigators, is the need to embed Kratos in a broader approach to firearms - and for more clarity in command structures, orders and language. Deborah Glass, an IPCC commissioner, has studied firearms tactics and says the public need to have a better understanding of the reality of armed operations. "The difficulty with having an operation called Kratos that is specifically about suicide bombers is that there is an implicit assumption that you are going to be always dealing with suicide bombers," she says. "You are giving it a level of certainty that does not appear in real life.
"So the problem can well be that if you create a mindset in firearms officers that you are dealing with a suicide bomber then the concerns commanders would have about what is the level of the threat may well be overtaken."
In the past year the Met responded to 10,000 potential firearms incidents and officers fired only three times.
Each of those deployments relied on highly trained officers being able to make split-second judgements on the nature of the threat they faced. The concerns about Kratos and broader firearms strategies are not necessarily about those split-second judgements - they are about the command and control that surrounds them - and the effect it has on the decision to pull the trigger.

Blue star sorry for New York comments
Updated 26 October 2001, 18.58
Blue star Lee Ryan has apologised for saying the US terror attacks have been "blown out of proportion".
During a webchat the singer said the killing of whales and elephants was more important than what happened in New York.
Bandmates Simon and Duncan both told Lee to shut up after he made his remarks.
'Deeply sorry'
Now Lee says: "I am deeply sorry for what I have said and apologise unreservedly to everyone affected by the tragedy of 11 September.
"I was trying to express my concerns for other issues close to my heart but I realise now I did so in a very foolish and offensive way."
And he told The Sun newspaper he would give his share of the profits from If You Come Back to the charity Twin Towers fund to say sorry. Watch/Listen

Celtic stun Barcelona
Barcelona 0-0 Celtic (agg:0-1)
UEFA CUP FOURTH ROUND SECOND-LEG
More Uefa Cup photos
Rookie goalkeeper David Marshall was the hero as Celtic progressed to the Uefa Cup quarter-finals at the expense of mighty Barcelona.
The 19-year-old made a string of fabulous saves as the Catalan giants pressed to claw back the 1-0 deficit from the first leg at Celtic Park.
Barcelona enjoyed the bulk of possession but could not break down the hard-working Scottish side. John Kennedy was another Celtic star, making a number of great tackles.
The home side started at a whirlwind pace and Celtic had to withstand a constant barrage of attacks right from the off.
An incisive move involving Carles Puyol and Ronaldinho found Gerard Lopez bursting into the penalty area inside the first minute and Marshall needed to make a great save at the midfielder's feet.
With six minutes gone Henrik Larsson found himself in behind the Barcelona defence but the striker lacked the pace to get away from Puyol.
Marshall then had to smother a header from Gerard, tip over a dangerous cross from Luis Garcia and make a wonderful reflex stop to keep out an awkward close-range attempt from Luis Enrique.
Celtic were finding it hard to hold on to the ball but Neil Lennon, Stilian Petrov and Alan Thompson were beginning to win more tackles in front of their under-pressure defence and disrupt the flow of the home side.
Brazilian ace Ronaldinho was showing lots of neat touches but twice his jinking runs were brought to a shuddering halt by perfectly-timed tackles from Kennedy.
Young David Marshall made some fantastic saves
As half-time approached Marshall was able to gather a long range effort from Xavi and Michael Reiziger's blistering shot was deflected wide. Didier Agathe made a foray deep into Barcelona territory but delayed his pass, with Larsson and Chris Sutton available, and the chance was gone.
Barcelona could not find the easy rhythm they displayed in the early stages but Celtic were again guilty of giving possession away cheaply.
The home side were laying siege to the Celtic penalty area and Luis Garcia's curling shot drifted narrowly wide of the post.
Larsson was given a glimpse of goal but Victor Valdes held the shot comfortably, while Petrov headed high and wide as Celtic hit on the break.
Well done mighty Celtic and David Marshall, only 19, big thanks for a memorable game From Voice of the silent masses
Have your say on 606
Ronaldinho had the crowd on their feet with a driving run into the box but Marshall was out quickly to block. The youngster then had to keep out a stinging drive from Gabri.
Marshall then made a breath-taking save to tip over a 10-yard volley from Luis Garcia that looked bound for the top corner of the net.
Barcelona substitute Sergio Garcia headed wide at the back post and saw his 75th minute shot pushed wide by the flying Marshall.
In the final 10 minutes Stanislav Varga and Kennedy made vital interceptions to thwart frantic Barcelona attacks.
Having completed a brilliant victory over one of Europe's elite clubs, Celtic, last season's beaten finalists, now face Spanish side Villareal in the last eight of the competition.
Barcelona: Valdes, Reiziger (Overmars 53), Puyol (Marquez 34), Oleguer, Xavi, Cocu, Gerard, Gabri, Luis Enrique (Sergio 64), Ronaldinho, Luis Garcia. Subs Not Used: Rustu, Quaresma, Iniesta, Oscar Lopez. Celtic: Marshall, Kennedy, McNamara (Miller 52), Varga, Agathe, Lennon, Pearson, Petrov, Thompson, Larsson, Sutton (Sylla 83).

As it happened
By Bryn Palmer
Bryan Habana took his try tally for the tournament to eight
South Africa (24) 37 Tries: Du Preez, Habana 2, Rossouw Cons: Montgomery 4 Pens: Montgomery 3
Argentina (6) 13 Tries: M Contepomi Cons: F Contepomi Pens: F Contepomi 2 England will face a World Cup final reunion with their pool conquerors South Africa after the Springboks ended Argentina's glorious run in the semis.
Tries from Fourie du Preez, Bryan Habana and Danie Rossouw put the favourites into a 24-6 half-time lead.
The Pumas, for whom Felipe Contepomi landed two penalties, rallied with a converted try from his brother Manuel.
But Percy Montgomery, who kicked 17 points, landed two more penalties before Habana pounced again to seal it.
The jet-heeled winger intercepted a pass from Argentina's star fly-half Juan Martin Hernandez and raced 80m to score his eighth try of the tournament, overtaking the departed Wallaby wing Drew Mitchell's tally.
England are proving a lot of people wrong
Springboks skipper John Smit
Habana will present the biggest attacking threat to England's hopes of becoming the first country to retain the Webb Ellis Trophy next Saturday at the Stade de France.
The Springboks crushed the reigning champions 36-0 at the same venue a month ago, but England's startling progress since that dark hour should ensure an enthralling finale to a scintillating World Cup. Argentina, who have done so much to enliven the tournament, started full of vim and vigour, driving the Boks back in the scrum and winning the territorial battle through the booming boot of Hernandez.
Du Preez grabbed the opening try
But they found themselves behind in the seventh minute.
Left wing Horacio Agulla cantered up the touchline to set up a promising attacking position inside the Springboks half, but Felipe Contepomi's pass was intercepted by Du Preez, who sprinted 70m to score.
Montgomery converted, and the World Cup's top points-scorer landed a penalty to make it 10-3 after Contepomi had punished Springboks captain John Smit for obstructing Agustin Pichot off the ball.
Argentina continued to look the more threatening side, but a string of errors spoiled their better work, while Contepomi missed a further penalty opportunity.
But he did punish an ill-advised counter attack from Francois Steyn just before the half-hour, when the Springboks centre was penalised for holding on in the tackle, to make it 10-6.
606: DEBATE
Argentina handed South Africa the game on a plate
FG
Suddenly South Africa looked vulnerable, but the whole complexion of the game changed in the 10 minutes before the interval.
Schalk Burger started the process by ripping the ball away from Pumas number eight Gonzalo Longo, and the Springboks pounced on the turnover with alacrity.
Steyn, showing his better qualities, quickly spread the ball wide with a 40m pass, where Victor Matfield put Habana into space.
Sizing up the situation in a flash, the world's deadliest finisher chipped ahead past his opposite number Lucas Borges and four Pumas forwards.
Argentina's only hope was an unkindly bounce of the ball, but Habana swiftly gathered and streaked away to the line.
Hernandez was unable to escape the Springbok shackles Montgomery converted and suddenly South Africa, from being under pressure, enjoyed the comfort of a 17-6 lead.
That became 24-6 with the final action of the half, and again Argentina had a hand in their own downfall.
The otherwise impressive Hernandez spilled a pass forward after Du Preez sent up a box-kick, and Steyn, Jaque Fourie and Burger combined to send number eight Rossouw over, Montgomery adding the extras.
That appeared to have settled the outcome, but Argentina rallied on the resumption and gave themselves a glimmer of hope with a try from Manuel Contepomi.
The centre appeared to have lost control of the ball over the line but after considering all the angles, English video referee Tony Spreadbury awarded the score.
We gave everything and I'm very proud of the boys
Pumas captain Agustin Pichot
Felipe Contepomi's conversion made it 24-13, and the Pumas briefly threatened to make a closer contest of it. But Contepomi missed a shot at goal after 53 minutes, and when Ignacio Corleto opted to run another kickable penalty on the hour and was then turned over, the game was up.
Habana had a try ruled out after JP Pietersen's pass was correctly ruled forward, but Montgomery landed the first of two clinching penalties in the 71st minute.
And with five minutes left, Habana showed his stunning speed again to put the issue beyond doubt.
Argentina's frustration surfaced late on as Felipe Contepomi was sin-binned for a petulant slap, moments after Springboks flanker Juan Smith was yellow-carded for a high tackle.
But that will be far from the abiding memory of the Pumas' contribution to this World Cup, while the Springboks head to the final as the only unbeaten side left. South Africa: Montgomery; Pietersen, Fourie, Steyn, Habana; James, Du Preez; Du Randt, Smit (capt), Van der Linde, Botha, Matfield, Burger, Smith, Rossouw.Replacements: B du Plessis, J du Plessis, Muller, Skinstad, Pienaar, Pretorius, Olivier.
