Howard says water key challenge
Australia is suffering its worst drought on record
Australian Prime Minister John Howard has announced a A$10bn ($7bn) package to tackle the country's water problems, as it faces a sixth year of drought.
Mr Howard said water security was the country's biggest challenge and the federal government wanted to take over the Murray-Darling river system.
The state governments of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria share its management now.
The idea, coming in an election year, could spark a political row.
Mr Howard's critics says he looking for ways to improve his image on the environment, where he is best known as one of the few developed world leaders to have refused to sign the Kyoto protocol on climate change.
Mr Howard addressed the issue in a speech on the eve of Australia Day.
"I regard myself as a climate-change realist. That means looking at the evidence as it emerges and responding with policies that preserve Australia's competitiveness and play to her strengths," he said. 'Parochial differences'
The BBC's Nick Bryant, in Sydney, says the Murray-Darling river system is the country's most precious water resource and provides supplies for most of Australia's irrigated farm land. The four state governments which manage it are controlled by the opposition Labor party, which has argued that the new proposals represent an unacceptable power grab by the prime minister.
Mr Howard wants the federal government to take over, in what would be the biggest reform of water management in the country's history. He believes that the present system of management is overly bureaucratic, a problem highlighted by the severe drought - the worst on record. "This is our great opportunity to fix a great national problem," he said. "It can only be solved if we surmount our parochial differences," he said.
The Murray-Darling takeover would cost A$3bn. Mr Howard's plan also envisages spending $6bn on modernising irrigation infrastructure and A$1.5bn on water saving for farmers.
The plan is the second indication in a week that Mr Howard is putting the environment at the centre of his re-election campaign.
On Tuesday he announced a new environment minister, Malcolm Turnbull, a former merchant banker best known for his failed attempt to make Australia a republic in a 1999 referendum. Mr Howard is expected to call an election in the second half of the year, and his coalition currently trails Labor in opinion polls.

Car depreciation rates worsening
The slowdown is putting the brakes on four-wheel drive prices
The current economic uncertainty, coupled with green taxes, are making car depreciation rates worse, according to motor industry analysts.
Analysts Eurotaxglass's have told the BBC the value of used cars will fall by an additional 8% this year.
Big family cars, which traditionally lose most value, and four-wheel drive vehicles are worst affected.
By comparison, say the experts, fuel efficient cars and smaller vehicles are holding their value better.
Slowdown
New cars automatically depreciate in value the moment they leave the garage forecourt.
The warning from Eurotaxglass's suggests that the increased cost of borrowing, stagnant house prices and the credit crunch have now spread to the car market.
But the experts are warning consumers to take account of resale values when purchasing a vehicle in order to avoid any nasty surprises down the line.

Barroso bashed over gas guzzler
Mr Barroso says his role is to set EU-wide energy targets The president of the European Commission has defended himself from criticism over his choice of a petrol-guzzling family car.
Jose Manuel Barroso's four-wheel drive emits far more carbon dioxide than the EU's own targets for vehicles.
But Mr Barroso says comments about his environmentally damaging car smack of "overzealous moralism".
The row comes as EU leaders are meeting to discuss carbon emissions targets at a major summit in Brussels.
'Private choices'
Mr Barroso is in favour of tougher curbs on carbon emissions as part of Europe's efforts to combat global warming.
But he has defended his choice of a Volkswagen Toureg, a model that emits around 350 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre driven.
The amount is well above the 130 grams per kilometre target set for all cars on Europe's roads by 2012.
"Look, I don't comment on private choices, the choices of your family or my family," Mr Barroso told the BBC's Joe Lynam.
"Our duty is to set targets and translate them into legislation. I don't think this climate of over-zealous moralism on the environment helps us."
Correspondents say Mr Barroso is not alone in making personal choices that jar with public policy.
Most commissioners, he says, drive cars that pollute at above-average levels with German-built high-tech BMWs or Mercedes being the favoured models.
British Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson, however, has opted for a fuel-thirsty Jaguar.

BBC News | SCI/TECH | Micro-magnets boost MRI

Micro-magnets boost MRI
Microstructured magnetic materials may improve medical imaging
A novel magnetic material invented by British researchers could lead to better diagnosis using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).
Scientists based at Imperial College, London, used spirals of metal film, a fraction of a millimetre thick, to channel magnetic flux from the body to an MRI scanner, improving the resolution.
They believe the material could help doctors get a quicker and clearer picture of what is wrong with a patient.
MRI is used to detect brain tumours, heart defects and injuries to the joints and spine.
Microstructured magnets
The material consists of a hexagonal array of 19 cylinders, each spiral-wound like a Swiss roll.
The material produced a clear image of the thumb
The coil array was placed between an object to be imaged, in this case one of the researcher's thumbs, and the receiver coil of an MRI device.
It helped to direct the magnetic flux from the thumb to the receiver coils to produce a clear image of the thumb's internal structure.
Professor Joseph Hajnal, of Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, said the research, reported in the journal Science, represented "a significant technological advance".
"In the future, we hope we will be able to make better MRI scanners than we have today," he told BBC News Online, "and so improve their power of medical imaging."
MRI scans
MRI is a technique that uses magnetic and radio waves to produce pictures of the body's tissues.
During MRI scanning, the patient lies inside a large, cylinder-shaped magnet which sends radio waves thousands of times stronger than the magnetic field of the Earth through the body. This affects the body's atoms, distorting their nuclei and sending out radio waves of their own. The scanner picks up these signals and they are turned into an image by a computer.
The technique is used to detect brain tumours and heart defects or to examine the joints, spine and sometimes organs like the liver, kidneys and spleen.
