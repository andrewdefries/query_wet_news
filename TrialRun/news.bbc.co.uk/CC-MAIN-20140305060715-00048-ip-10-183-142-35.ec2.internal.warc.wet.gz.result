Eyewitness: Forced off the farm
The Dutoit farm: Taken over
By Gavin Hewitt in Karoi, Zimbabwe
We are outside Pierre Dutoit's farm in Karoi, north-west of Harare.
It is just one of hundreds of white-owned farms in Zimbabwe which has been taken over by government supporters.
"We are the new owners here," a man with a stick tells us. He is at the farm's gates with 150 men with axes and clubs. We are unable to film them, because they tell us they will turn their axes on us if we try it.
Rex Jesus seems to be above the law
There is little farm owners can do. Squatters in farm after farm insist that they must sign over part of their land. The courts have declared these occupations illegal, but they have the backing of President Robert Mugabe.
Suddenly, the man behind the farm invasions in this area, Rex Jesus, arrives. His companions are all carrying long knives. He has links to the ruling party and seems to operate above the law. He enters the farm, amid shouting and chanting.
The Dutoits are given just 10 minutes to leave their farm - the first time a white farmer has been evicted. It comes less than a week after President Mugabe had threatened severe violence against them.
Mrs Dutoit: "Everything we've worked for"
As the Dutoits stop to speak to us, the squatters appear, angry and threatening. We, too, had to leave. A short distance up the road, we find the shaken couple.
"I am very upset," says Mrs Dutoit. "We've waited for 17 years. Finally we've been able to
buy a farm, we got the certificate of no interest from the government, and now this.
"It's everything we've worked for our whole lives."
Growing fears
As the story of one of the Dutoits' workers reveals, some of these incidents seem more about the forthcoming election than land. He says he was beaten by Rex Jesus for supporting the opposition, and President Mugabe is blaming the white farmers for backing his opponents.
Farm workers demonstrate the beating they say they received
Ten miles away, men with axes are squatting on another farm. A threatening crowd had demanded the owners sign over part of their farm, but they refused.
Farm owner Jane O'Donaghue says: "My concern is that really this is just the start of it. There could be a lot worse than this to come."
There is a real issue about land here - 4,000 white farmers own a third of the most productive land. But they believe that President Mugabe, in a bid to stay in power, is playing the race card, making the whites the issue.
As white farmers look out on their dream land, they, like others in Zimbabwe, are beginning to doubt whether whites have a future under African skies.

Gaza economy faces tough struggle
By James Melik
Business reporter, BBC World Service
The UN says Gaza will be reliant on foreign aid for years
The citizens of Gaza have long been victims of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with its years of underinvestment, political turmoil and violence.
The immediate image which springs to mind is one of suffering and bloodshed, but part of Gaza's story is about a dismantled economy which is unable to support its own population.
There is widespread unemployment and the economy has not expanded beyond agriculture, small-scale industry, or crossing the border to work in Israel.
The industrial sector in the Gaza Strip has been badly affected, because factories depend on importing raw materials and exporting some of what they produce - all of which has been disrupted over recent years.
The economy relies on exporting to Israel, which then re-exports those goods to other countries.
Trade obstacles
Trade with Israel and Jordan accounts for 98% of all Palestinian exports, but the private sector will not prosper as long as Israeli checkpoints and cumbersome cargo crossings remain in place, the World Bank said in a report published in December 2008.
Israel has been slow in easing its tight restrictions on Palestinian movement, citing security concerns, but the World Bank said Israel could make improvements, even within this closure regime.
Tunnelling is the only type of business which has proved lucrative
Sami Abdel Shafi
It warns that the Palestinian economy, heavily reliant on trade, will not recover unless the restrictions are eased significantly.
Meanwhile, the United Nations has its own big reconstruction projects - a new sewerage system for Gaza and 1,200 new dwellings for homeless people.
However, many of the UN's projects stand idle, because materials are very slow coming across the border with Israel.
Mixed blessing
After a successful career in the United States, Sami Abdel Shafi returned to Gaza in 2004 to set up a management consultancy. One of his goals was to improve Gaza's image.
"I was hoping to be able to help contribute to the development of the Gaza Strip," he told BBC World Service's Business Daily.
"We are a global economy and Gaza has a great deal of potential, but unfortunately, consecutive complications are causing many people to lose their skills and their competitive edge," he laments.
He says the only retail establishments operating during the current conflict are a few bakeries, and concedes that the only profitable business in Gaza has been the tunnels under the border with Egypt.
"According to reports, that is the only type of business which has proved to be lucrative," he says.
"Although the tunnels were first used for smuggling arms, ordinary people - the unemployed, uneducated and the impoverished - thought their only chance was to be engaged in the business of tunnels," he explains.
Nothing can go forward without the freedom of movement
Sami Abdel Shafi
Mr Shafi pointed out that bright young men, who could not get the education they wanted and who were prevented from leaving Gaza, turned to tunnels as a way of supporting their families financially.
Many of the consumer goods found in the markets, such as toys, soft drinks and chocolate, have flooded into Gaza through the tunnels.
"It is very detrimental to the business environment, because it encourages the black market and even though it is a mixed blessing, people become accustomed to an unnatural way of exchange.
"It hurts the chances of people developing a proper economy that is run according to internationally recognised standards," he says.
'Resilience remains'
But will a ceasefire make any difference to the state of the economy in Gaza?
The World Bank says border crossings have to be eased to help trade
According to Mr Shafi, it will only benefit the saving of human lives.
"What should happen after that is a serious political effort to resolve the root causes of what is going on - which is the siege of Gaza," he says.
"That should pave the way for the opening of the crossing points into the Gaza Strip and once that happens, there could be some development in the economy."
With a population of 1.5 million people - 57% of whom live below the UN poverty threshold of $2 a day - the UN says it seems inevitable that Gaza will depend on foreign aid for many years to come.
Mr Shafi still feels optimistic about the future, however. "People in the Gaza Strip are very highly motivated and very resilient," he says.
"They are able to pick up the pieces and go forward - but nothing can go forward without the freedom of movement."

France 'completes' tallest bridge
Cars will travel 270m above the Tarn Valley on the Millau Bridge
Construction workers in southern France have connected the last link in the world's highest road bridge. The bridge over the River Tarn in the Massif Central mountains will carry vehicles across a 2.5km (1.5 miles) valley at a height of 270m (885ft).
When finished, the highest pillar will stand at just over 340m (1,115ft) tall. The Millau bridge is expected to open for traffic by the end of the year, completing a new motorway link between Paris and the Mediterranean.
Once its pylons and giant suspension cables are in place, the structure will be higher than the Eiffel Tower, which reaches 343m.
'Heroic and extraordinary'
Workers on either side of the bridge shook hands and opened bottles of champagne after the final section was lowered into place on Friday afternoon, AFP news agency reported.
It is being constructed by Eiffage, the company that built the Eiffel Tower, and will have taken three-and-a-half years to complete.
Find out more about the Millau bridge
At-a-glance The company has shouldered the 260m euro construction cost ($300m) in return for the right to collect receipts from a bridge toll for 75 years.
Like Concorde and the Channel Tunnel, the bridge is Franco-British. The world-renowned architect Norman Foster is behind the design.
"I think it's heroic, it's extraordinary," he told BBC News Online after a visit to the site late last year.
"To have discussions, conversations, studies and models and then to see that being translated into reality in this landscape is an extraordinary experience and I think it touches everyone."
The project was due to take three years, but weather conditions put work on the bridge behind schedule. The heat wave over last year's summer meant some of the welding could not be done, and over the previous winter it was so cold some work had to be halted.

Five-step check for nano safety
Carbon nanotubes are one of the building blocks of nanotechnology
A team of experts has drawn up five "grand challenges" in order to evaluate the safety of nanotechnology.
The field's potential could be compromised unless the scientific community can implement a programme of systematic risk research, it warns.
Writing in Nature journal, the team says that fears about nanotechnology's possible dangers may be exaggerated, but not necessarily unfounded.
The five challenges are designed to be completed over the next 15 years.
"The threat of possible harm - whether real or imagined - is threatening to slow the development of nanotechnology unless sound, independent and authoritative information is developed on what the risks are and how to avoid them," author Andrew Maynard and his colleagues write in Nature.
The five grand challenges include developing instruments to evaluate exposure to engineered nanomaterials in air and water and developing methods for assessing their toxicity.
NANOTECH'S FIVE CHALLENGES
Develop instruments to assess exposure to engineered nanomaterials in air and water within next 3-10 years
Create and test ways of evaluating the toxicity of nanomaterials in 5-15 years
Generate models to predict their possible impact on the environment and human health over the next 10 years
Develop ways to assess the health and environmental impact of nanomaterials over their entire lifetime, within the next five years
Organise programmes to enable risk-focused research into nanomaterials, within the next 12 months
The group of experts says that if the global research community can take advantage of the safety infrastructure already in place for biotechnology and computing, then nanotechnology has a rosy future.
But Dr Maynard, from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington DC, and colleagues say that the way science is carried out means it is ill-equipped to address novel risks from emerging technologies. Research into understanding and preventing risk often has a low priority in the world of technology development, research funding and intellectual property, they say.
"Without strategic and targeted risk research, people producing and using nanomaterials could develop unanticipated illness arising from their exposure," the authors warn in Nature.
"Public confidence in nanotechnologies could be reduced through real or perceived dangers and fears of litigation may make nanotechnologies less attractive to investors and the insurance industry."
Safety studies
Recent studies on nanoparticles in cell cultures and animals show that a variety of factors influence their potential to cause harm. These include their size, surface area, surface chemistry and ability to dissolve in water.
This should come as no surprise. Inhaled dust has been known to cause disease for many years. Small particles of inhaled quartz can lead to lung damage, with the potential for progressive lung disease. But the same particles with a thin coating of clay are less harmful.
Long, thin fibres of asbestos can also lead to lung disease if inhaled, but grinding the fibres down to shorter particles reduces their harmfulness.
In May, the UK's Royal Society called on industry to disclose how it tests products containing nanoparticles.
A joint report by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering two years ago said there was no need to ban nanoparticle production.
But it said tighter UK and European regulation over some aspects of nanotechnology - manipulation of molecules - was needed to ensure its long-term safety.

Criminals target viruses for cash
By Mark Ward Technology Correspondent, BBC News website
There were few large scale virus outbreaks in 2005
At first glance 2005 looks like it was a quiet year for computer security because there were far fewer serious Windows virus outbreaks than in 2004.
According to figures gathered by security firm Symantec, there were 33 serious outbreaks in 2004. These are incidents measured by the number of people a virus infects or the severity of the damage they inflict. In 2005, there were only six such incidents.
"We're talking about a substantial decrease in worldwide pandemics," said Kevin Hogan, senior manager in Symantec's security response team. This decline is taking place because virus makers have largely stopped spreading their malicious wares with mass-mailers that try to infect as many people as possible via their inbox.
Looks familiar
Instead, virus creators are cranking out more versions of malicious programs than ever before. Year-end statistics from Finnish anti-virus firm F-Secure show that there were 50% fewer virus outbreaks in 2005 but the number of malicious programs has grown by, on average, 40% for the last two years.
PC SAFETY TIPS
Install anti-virus software. Update it daily
Regularly scan your PC to ensure it is clean of viruses
Install a firewall. Keep it updated
Use one or more spyware scanners. Keep them updated and scan your PC regularly.
Do not respond to unsolicited e-mails bearing attachments.
Keep Internet Explorer updated or use another web browser
Be careful to check what also comes with anything you download from the web
Keep Windows updated and apply patches for security loopholes
Be careful where you visit online. Some sites may harbour spyware.
Similarly Sophos reported that it found 1,940 new malicious programs in November 2005, the largest increase since records began. Evidence for this rash of variants can be found in the list of the top 20 viruses for 2005 compiled by Kaspersky labs in which the MyTob virus fills nine places.
Security experts say this explosion in variants is partly driven by a desire to overwhelm anti-virus firms. With defences spread thinly, hackers believe they will have more time for their particular creation to infect machines.
The malicious hackers are also keen to replenish the ranks of the viruses circulating online as fixes are found for previous versions.
Targeted code
It also marks a tactical change toward more customised attacks. Instead of trying to infect everyone, many virus creators are creating variants that attack small groups of users. Sometimes these are customers of particular companies, often banks, and occasionally they are the workers in a single organisation. Visit the wrong website and your computer could catch a bug
Smaller groups are being targeted because many of the groups sending out viruses are criminals keen to profit from the machines they compromise. Mr Hogan from Symantec said there was only circumstantial evidence in 2004 that criminals were getting involved in viruses, spam and phishing. But in terms of this year, he said: "With customers and others we have seen clear evidence that this is being done for money." Virus writers can make money by renting out control of the machines they have compromised as spam relays, pop-up ad networks, for mounting net attacks or as hosts for illegal material.
It is not just virus writers that are customising their attacks. This year has also seen phishing gangs refine their methods to try to improve their success.
For instance, in August 2005, customers of Swedish bank Nordea received an e-mail in their local language that tried to make them visit spoof websites and type in security codes.
Notified about the attack, Nordea shut down its online arm while it made sure no money had been illicitly transferred.
Other custom attacks have been launched against players of online games, such as Lineage, in an attempt to steal player accounts.
Stealthy software
Not all malicious hackers make money by stealing it. 2005 saw large numbers of tech savvy criminals generating significant incomes by compromising computers so people are bombarded with pop-up ads or have their web browser hijacked so it takes them to sites they would not otherwise visit. Behind these pop-up bombardments and browser hijackings are so-called adware and spyware programs. These can be contracted by visiting the wrong website which forces the installation of adware; by downloading applications such as file-sharing programs in which the adware lurks or by following a link in an e-mail.
Virus writers are starting to target online game players
Online security firm ScanSafe, which cleans up web traffic for customers, said the amount of spyware it had blocked was doubling every month since it started its monitoring program earlier in 2005.
It also said that the number of web-based attacks that try to install spyware and adware had grown by 165% in the last 12 months.
Spyware makers were working hard to stop their creations being found said Eldar Turvey, chief executive of ScanSafe.
"Spyware is becoming more stealthy," said Mr Turvey. Many viruses are designed to be disposable but spyware makers want their creations to persist. Many spyware makers were disguising the data their programs send back by making it look like ordinary web browser traffic that easily slips through firewalls.
One final worrying trend seen in 2005 was the emergence of attacks aimed at security software.
Many makes of anti-virus, firewall and PC protection programs are seen as a weak link by hacker groups. Many are trying to subvert the programs that are supposed to protect users and exploit weaknesses to give them access to users' machines.

Inland revenue drops club claim
Exeter City reached agreement with creditors in October
The future of Exeter City Football Club has become more secure after the dropping of a financial claim by the Inland Revenue against the club.
Last October the club agreed a deal with the majority of its creditors over debts of about ï¿½4m. But the Inland Revenue, which was owed about ï¿½350,000, had threatened to go to court to challenge the agreement.
In the Corporate Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), creditors are receiving 10 pence in the pound over five years.
'Legal wrangles'
The Inland Revenue launched a challenge against the CVA as it believed the football creditors' part of the agreement was unlawful, and a hearing was due to take place on 19 July.
The Inland Revenue refused to comment on its decision to drop the case, but City managing director Ian Huxham described the news as "wonderful".
He said: "It's terrific news and we can now look forward with the knowledge we don't face any more legal wrangles."
"This had been like a cloud hanging over the club."
However, they club still has a long way to go to clear its money worries. It currently has to pay off ï¿½400,000 of its debt within 18 months or it will go out of business.

Final air miles for 'spy in the sky' crews
By James Cook
Scotland correspondent, BBC News
A grey drizzle was falling as we roared off the runway at RAF Kinloss and banked for the Irish Sea.
The BBC's James Cook was on board one of the final flights
We were passengers on one of the final flights of the Nimrod MR2, which has been Britain's spy in the sky for more than 30 years. The Nimrod was based on the very first jet airliner, the De Havilland Comet. The MR2 version took to the skies in 1981 after being upgraded from the MR1 which had already been flying for a decade. The aircraft has proved incredibly useful and amazingly versatile. From the Falklands to Afghanistan, via Kosovo and Iraq, the Nimrod operated as a radio tower in the clouds, providing secure communications for troops on the ground. In recent years it streamed live video of Taliban soldiers back to British bases.
Every vessel in the sea beneath us - from a tiny yacht to a long, black and red tanker - was spotted, videotaped, photographed and identified
End of era for old Nimrods marked
It could even spot roadside bombs by looking for patterns in the dust. But the Nimrod's real home was over water, as we discovered. The RAF had invited us to film a scenario involving a search for smugglers in the Irish Sea. The training mission began near Anglesey with the crew working their way north, taking great care to avoid Irish territorial waters. Every vessel in the sea beneath us - from a tiny yacht to a long, black and red tanker - was spotted, videotaped, photographed and identified: this was CCTV for the shipping lanes. Live pictures from a camera under the wing were fed into the Nimrod. They were incredibly steady and sharp. The operator could read the names of ships several miles away. But this was just a thin slice of the Nimrod's capabilities.
Crew - 13
Main equipment - Sonobuoys, radar, magnetic and acoustic detection equipment, torpedoes, bombs, depth charges, Sidewinder self-defence missiles
Max speed - 575mph (925 kph)
Length - 126ft 9in (38.63m)
Height - 29ft 8.5in (9m)
Wingspan - 114ft 10in (35m)
Powerplant - Four Rolls-Royce Spey turbofans
Source: RAF
For many years its key role was Cold War reconnaissance, scouring the seas for Soviet submarines and ships as well as guarding Britain's subs and their nuclear cargo. The Nimrod stayed in the skies so long because the RAF simply couldn't do without it. It kept flying even when disaster struck. On 2 September 2006 a Nimrod MR2 XV230 exploded over Kandahar, Afghanistan, after a leak during air-to-air refuelling. All 14 men on board died. At the inquest into the men's deaths in May 2008, the coroner called for the jet to be grounded. The defence secretary, Bob Ainsworth, refused. "The Nimrod is saving lives in operational theatres every day," he said. "If it was not safe we would not be flying it." Replacement delaysIn October 2008 an independent review into the crash accused the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and its contractors of sacrificing safety to make savings. The response was to spend millions modifying the aircraft to keep it flying. And yet the official reason for grounding the MR2 now is cost. Graham Knight, whose son, Sgt Ben Knight, died in the explosion, believes that didn't make sense. He said: "They spent Â£16m on actually doing the necessary repairs to these aircraft in order to make them safe to flyÂand they then announce that they're not going to fly them any more? "It seems quite bizarre to me that they're grounding an aircraft that's safer now than it's ever been." It might make more sense if the MR2's replacement was ready. But it isn't.
If the base was to shut then the impact would be quite devastating on a lot of businesses in the community
Phil BreedLocal landlord
The Nimrod MRA4 is already a decade late and millions of pounds over budget. It is now due to arrive at RAF Kinloss for training in July but it won't enter active service until autumn 2012 at the earliest. In the meantime, says the MoD, the Nimrod's work will be carried out "by a variety of different aircraft" including helicopters. Privately many in the RAF insist this is just not possible. One senior officer has even told the BBC that he thinks grounding the MR2 will put lives at risk by depriving search and rescue helicopters of good overhead surveillance. And the wait for the MRA4 makes the community around RAF Kinloss, on the edge of Moray's fertile farmland, nervous. Dozens of jobs have already been lost at the base because of the withdrawal of the MR2 earlier than planned. Crew skillsPhil Breed, the landlord of the local pub, The Abbey Inn, sums up the concerns. He said: "If the base was to shut then the impact would be quite devastating on a lot of businesses in the community. "There was a lot of rumour going around that the station was going to shutÂthat they were going to pull out completely so a lot of people were very, very worried." Mr Breed said he had been somewhat reassured by the RAF at a recent town hall meeting - and the MoD insists that it is committed to RAF Kinloss. But for a while at least the skies around here will be a little quieter. Before that could happen though, our Nimrod had to return to base.
NIMROD LOSSES
17 November 1980: Bird strike at Roseisle Forest, near Kinloss, Scotland
3 June 1984: Fire on board at St Mawgan, Cornwall
16 May 1995: Engine fire at Lossiemouth, Scotland
2 September 1995: Crash at Toronto Air Show, Canada
2 September 2006: Crash near Kandahar, Afghanistan
As the exercise had continued in the clear skies of the Irish Sea, the weather at RAF Kinloss had been deteriorating. Suddenly the pilot, Flt Lt Drew Buxton, announced that the task had been cut short. The weather was closing in back at base and he was heading for home immediately. If the fog over Moray was too thick, the Nimrod would be diverted to Prestwick in Ayrshire. If that was not available, RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire would be the final chance to land. On the first three attempts to put the aircraft down the pilots reported zero visibility. Flying blind at 200ft was disconcerting for amateurs like us - but the crew did not seem worried. They had seen it all before. On the fourth attempt there was a shout of "land it!", followed a second later by "I have control" and in a flash we were on the ground. We hardly felt a bump. It had been a fine demonstration of the skills of the Nimrod pilot and his crew, designed no doubt to convince the public that they and their aircraft were indispensable.

Colleges debate 2
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Scottish Liberal Democrat education spokesman Liam McArthur said the actions of the education secretary Mike Russell had undermined the Scottish government's efforts to deal with the issues facing colleges.Mr McArthur was closing the second part of the debate on colleges for his party on 22 November 2012. On 20 November 2012 Mr Russell offered a "full and unreserved" apology for using the wrong budget figure, which came after an apology from the first minister the preceding week. Mr McArthur told the chamber Mr Russell had done damage to himself and his government and said the education secretary was "weakened and compromised". Scottish Conservative MSP Gavin Brown said it was an SNP political choice to reduce the college budget, as the Scottish budget was facing a cash terms cut of 0.5% but the college budget was being cut by just over 6%. Labour Education spokesperson Hugh Henry said Mike Russell reminded him of Sean Penn, who starred in the film "Dead Man Walking" saying if the education secretary had any integrity he would step down. Closing the debate Education Secretary Mike Russell said the debate had been "unpleasant" not just for him, but for the Scottish Parliament, the college sector and country. Mr Russell accused the opposition parties of engaging in a "political bun fight" with substantial misrepresentations made for political reasons. He added the debate had "dishonoured" the political progress, echoing Mr Salmond's point that their apologies would have been accepted in any other chamber in the world. Mr Russell finished by insisting he was "going on" as was the government and the process of college reform. The parliament passed the Scottish government motion with 62 MSPs backing it and 53 voting against it. The first part of the debate can be viewed below: Please turn on JavaScript.

Revealing the Salford Hundred
A different medieval Manchester may soon be revealed
From Roman Mamucium to the 'dark satanic mills' of the Industrial Revolution, you might think that you know the history of Greater Manchester.According to a local archaeologist though, there's a major gap in your knowledge - and it is one that, when filled in, could change the story of the area forever. Stuart Mendelsohn says that understanding the history of the Salford Hundred - a medieval administrative area that roughly took in all but the southern parts of Greater Manchester - is crucial to the story of the region. As a result, he has set up a blog, Finding Medieval Documentation for Salford Hundred, to collate information and help show just what medieval Manchester was like. He says he started the blog after he "found that a lot of the history of Manchester in medieval documents is unknown, even to some experts." Most surprisingly, he explains that "when you look at this information, it changes the interpretation of the early history of the North West." Rochdale's rich historyQuite how far off the reality of medieval Manchester the modern perception is is becoming clear to Stuart through his research, as he says even looking at tiny areas can reveal a wealth of new, historically significant information. Stuart says knowing the history of the Salford Hundred is crucial
"When you look at some areas, you find amazing things. People think that Rochdale, for example, is not so interesting historically - wrong, absolutely wrong! "Whitworth, a small village near Rochdale, has nearly 100 medieval charters mentioning land transfers in the Coucher Book of Whalley Abbey [which records land gifts to the medieval Cistercian monastery]. "That means that the people in Whitworth and Rochdale had a higher status legally than the majority of the population in southern England - and that's obvious, because you wouldn't need to write 100 charters if it was just one big landlord. "What you see is that there were many separate individuals who were able to give land in the 13th century, and that must show a very different land ownership than the presumed one feudal lord and many peasants who couldn't do much. "So the truth is contradictory to what most people assume the area was like - that it was poorly populated and a poor area." Mistakes and misinterpretationsAll of Stuart's findings - which also include evidence of commercial textile production by small holders in the area four centuries before the Industrial Revolution - throw up the question why the medieval history of Greater Manchester has been misreported in the past. He says that it's not surprising that mistakes and misinterpretations have happened in the past, as there are several factors that make the researching of this period difficult. There are a lot of people that don't know about the records - making them an untapped gold mine of historical information
Stuart Mendelsohn
"A lot of the documents are in Medieval Latin - and not everyone reads Medieval Latin - so someone has to translate them. "And even when some of them were translated over a century ago, those books have now gone out of print and people just haven't looked at them. "Also, the records are all over the country and archiving differs from place to place. "I went to the Bodleian Library in Oxford to ask about the Black Book of Clayton, a collection of deeds from the area which includes information about the Byron family, and they didn't know what is was. "When I asked them about the Byron Chartulary, its other name, they knew it straight away - but the Victorian county history talks about the Black Book - so things can get confusing. "As a result, what I found is that even when people have done surveys, they haven't looked at the history books or even the major records. "But I realised that the reason they hadn't is because they don't know about them. "There are a lot of people that don't know about the records - making them an untapped gold mine of historical information." A proud heritage
Chetham's Library dates from the late medieval period
Stuart says that by revealing this history through his blog and through the newly formed Salford Hundred Heritage Society, he won't just be helping to complete the story of Manchester, but also be giving Greater Mancunians a history to revel in. "I hope this awareness will lead to people being more proud of their heritage, environment and local communities. "I hope it will get people involved and lead them to say 'this is special for where I live - it's my landscape and my history' and be proud of that."
