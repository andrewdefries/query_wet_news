Zimbabwean police 'fire-bombed'
Mr Tsvangirai says his beating should be an inspiration to activists
Two Zimbabwean policewomen are in hospital with serious facial injuries after their Harare base was fire-bombed, police say.
A police spokesman blamed the attack on the "armed wing" of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change and said force would be used against them.
The reported attack comes as MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai remains in hospital after allegedly being beaten by police.
Western nations have called for more sanctions on Zimbabwean officials.
'Necessary force'
Assistant Commissioner Wayne Bvudzijena said that a police camp in the central city of Gweru was also fire-bombed on Wednesday night.
"We are seeing militia-style attacks by an armed wing of the MDC," he told the AFP news agency.
He warned that the police would meet such violence with the "necessary force to ensure peace and stability is maintained".

Zimbabwe's information minister has said the MDC would "pay a heavy price" for inciting violence and said Mr Tsvangirai's injuries were sustained when he and others attacked police during a political meeting last Sunday.
The MDC leader denies being involved in any violence and said his beating should be an "inspiration" for the struggle against President Robert Mugabe.
Scores of other MDC officials and activists were arrested and allegedly assaulted after police broke up a rally on Sunday.
One man was shot dead.
South African pressure
Meanwhile, Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete has gone for an unscheduled meeting with Mr Mugabe to discuss the situation in Zimbabwe.
Tanzania has traditionally been a close ally of Zimbabwe's long-time leader.

Q&A: Zimbabwe meltdown
Mr Mugabe and top government and ruling party officials are already subject to a travel ban and assets freeze by the US and the EU but these may now be extended.
UK Prime Minister Tony Blair described the situation as a tragedy for the people of Zimbabwe.
"They should be able to express their political views without harassment or intimidation or violence. And what is happening in Zimbabwe is truly tragic," he said.
Mr Blair was speaking after a meeting with Ghanaian President John Kufuor, who is currently chairman of the African Union.
Mr Kufuor said African leaders were embarrassed by the situation in Zimbabwe but rejected suggestions that they were unconcerned by the violence.
The action against Sunday's demonstration was also strongly condemned by the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon.
But the most unexpected criticism came from South Africa, which urged Mr Mugabe to respect the rights of citizens, including opposition leaders.
BBC Africa editor Martin Plaut says that after years of fending off international pressure, Pretoria has adopted an entirely new tone. South Africa is the regional powerhouse and analysts believe it is the country best placed to put pressure on Mr Mugabe to either step down or do more to respect human rights and change his economic policies.
Mr Mugabe has said he wants to change the constitution to remain in office until 2010, even though his term of office is due to expire next year.
Civil discontent in Zimbabwe is rising over the country's economic crisis, with chronic unemployment and inflation running at more than 1,700% - the highest in the world.

Womens' pension woe in spotlight
Women have lower incomes than men in old age
The government has said that it is to publish a report next year into the pension problems facing UK women.
The commitment was made by Pensions Minister Malcolm Wicks during the committee stage of the Pensions Bill.
In general, women retire with smaller pensions than men as a result of lower pay and taking time-off work to bring up children or look after relatives.
Charities and Labour backbench MPs have been pressing for acute pensioner poverty amongst women to be tackled.
Solutions
Women in England have to live on just over half the retirement income of their male counterparts, according to Recent research from the Transport and General Workers Union (T&G).
Age Concern England warned that the government's report would need to offer solutions rather than just outlining the pension problems facing women in old age.
"For this report to be worthwhile, it must come up with practical solutions that will be implemented and improve pensions prospects of today's and tomorrow's pensioners," Michelle Mitchell, a spokeswoman said.

Planned cap on spending in old age
BBC Radio 4's Money Box
Saturday, 14th July 2012 at 1204 BST On Radio 4 and Online
Listen to the programme
Programme transcript (17 pages)
The Government said this week that it would set a cap on the total amount any individual had to pay for their care in old age.But a lot of key details were omitted, including what that cap should be or when it would begin. It did say that a new universal deferred payment scheme would begin from April 2015. But how new was that idea? We hear from Lisa Morgan, a partner at Hugh James solicitors. We also talk to Dot Gibson, General Secretary of the National Pensioners Forum and Gus Hanton, Co-Founder of the Intergenerational Foundation about who should pick up the cost of care. Related Links:

Farepak payoutMore than 100,000 victims of the collapse of the Farepak Christmas club in 2006 will get a total of 50p for every pound they lost. And the money will be paid by this Christmas. They have already had 17.5p and another 32p is now due to be paid after LloydsTSB agreed to put £8 million into the fund following criticism form a judge in a court case. But how much are the administrators/liquidators getting? We speak to Louise McDaid who lost money in the Farepak collapse and Mike Dailly from the Govan Law Centre. Related Links:

Martin case tops BBC's Today poll
Farmer Tony Martin's case has influenced the bill
A proposal to allow homeowners to use "any means" to defend their homes, has topped a BBC poll on the bill people would most like to see become law.
BBC Radio 4's Today programme asked listeners to vote on suggested Private Members' Bills, with the first choice taking 37% of the votes.
Norfolk farmer Tony Martin, whose fatal shooting of a burglar in 1999 sparked a national debate, welcomed the result.
Second place went to a bill to encourage more organ donations. 'Conflicting legislation'
Mr Martin said a change in the law was needed to protect homeowners.
"This is wrong, heinously wrong, that you should actually live in fear in
your home that if somebody breaks in that, basically, you are going to have the
law jump down on you. It is just not right," he said.
Asked whether he would do the same thing again, he said: "In the same
circumstances, yes, if I am terrorised."
More than 26,000 votes were registered by listeners taking part in the poll and the winning bill will now be presented to the House of Commons by Stephen Pound MP. He will need to persuade the 20 MPs who have been chosen to put forward Private Members Bills to take up the poll winner's suggestion.
Tony Martin's MP, Conservative Henry Bellingham said the idea went too far by suggesting homeowners should use "any means" to protect their property.
Wild west
However he added: "I think the law at the moment is totally confused. The current test of reasonable force is discredited ... there appears to be a presumption of guilt against the householder, and I think what we need is a presumption of innocence in favour of the householder."
But leading criminal barrister John Cooper warned that the idea was dangerously flawed.
He said: "The law as it stands at the moment, despite its critics, is
functioning. If you are in your house and you are attacked by someone or
threatened by someone, you can use proportionate force.
"We do not live in the wild west. This legislation that is proposed
effectively may well turn us into that."Organ hope
The second most popular bill in the poll calls for an opt out clause in organ donation, so that the organs of those who have died are used automatically unless the deceased person specifically stated a refusal.
Dr Evan Harris, Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, who supports the suggested bill, said the system is used in other European countries and would allow more organs to be used.
Some 80% of people are said to be in favour of having their organs donated in the event of their death, yet only 20% carry a donor card, he said.

Chinese get a taste of Blairism
By Nick Assinder
Political correspondent, BBC News website, with Tony Blair in Beijing
It must be a coincidence mustn't it? Old pals act: Mr Blair applauds his former cabinet colleague
But the minute Tony Blair flew into Beijing insisting "bra wars" was entirely Peter Mandelson's problem, peace broke out. Needless to say, the last thing Mr Blair wanted was for the textiles dispute to overshadow the summit which, he believes, goes to the heart of his current agenda as both prime minister and holder of the rotating presidency of the EU. In fact he saw the row as a glaring example of the EU failing to rise to the challenges posed by the new economies of China and India. The same desire for a resolution was also true of the Chinese government. So it is probably accurate to say that the two prime ministers did not need to "step in" to the dispute even though they inevitably touched on it in their meetings. Mr Mandelson and his opposite number, on the other hand, were still required to stay up all night to hammer out the deal. Increasing trade
There were always plans for big things from this stage of the prime minister's four day mission to China and India. There was much excitement when the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, appeared to make stronger than usual comments about his desire to extend democracy in China
Diary: Blair in China
And neither side wanted their more long-term and significant announcements on trade, climate change and cultural and political relations to be relegated to the second division of stories coming out of Beijing. So the very fact this summit was happening was probably enough to focus minds. Summits tend to do that. The only wrinkle was the need for the deal - which is set to see the Chinese off-setting half of their textiles quota against next year - to be ratified by all the other EU states. But this was an issue the summit leaders wanted taken off the agenda - particularly the media's agenda. The bigger picture, for the summit leaders, was growing trade relations. As the UK prime minister said, that picture is one of increasing trade between the EU and China that is likely to be worth $200bn and thousands and thousands of jobs. Communist trappings
Chinese prime minister Wen Jiabao agreed with Mr Blair that "difficulties and frictions" in the growing trade relations were inevitable, as with the textiles dispute, but they were of "minor" significance. A deal was always on the cards
What mattered were trade deals and action on climate change - which saw a new agreement in which the EU will help China cut carbon emissions with the gift of a new, clean power station. All this came, symbolically, in the spectacular Great Hall of the People, on Tianenmen Square, still proudly displaying its old-style Communist trappings - all red flags and giant pictures of Mao. All around, of course, are the giant offices, malls and building sites, standing as reminders of the transformation this country is going through and which is driving China to become the greatest economic power in the globe within 40 years. And that, of course, is Tony Blair's point. Blairism
It is one he has been making for some time and on which he turned up the volume when he took over the rotating presidency of the EU. Europe and the rest of the world need to face up to the challenges presented by this huge economy and, in a characteristic bit of Blairism, turn them into opportunities. As he told the summit: "there is a place for managing change but no place for resisting change". That was a pretty clear hint to EU countries who had cut up rough over the import of Chinese textiles. The UK prime minister's instincts are free trade and anti-protectionist and he believes that is the only realistic and successful way of meeting the challenges posed by China and India. With that point, he believes, made, Tuesday will see the focus shifting towards cultural relations. Celebrities including ballerina Darcey Bussell, athlete Colin Jackson, former England soccer boss Sir Bobby Robson, film maker Richard Curtis and architect Lord Norman Foster will all give master classes in their respective specialisms to youngsters and students. In the evening the prime minister will leave for New Delhi for the second leg of this tour.

People hurt in Big Dipper crash
Thirty people were hurt when two rollercoaster carriages collided on Blackpool's famous Big Dipper ride.The second carriage hit the back of the first, which had become jammed. The cars came to rest six metres above the ground, leaving people stuck inside. Firefighters used a specialist rope team to get people onto stretchers and down from the ride. As many as 21 people were then taken to hospital. The ride is now shut while an investigation takes place. Rollercoaster dos and don'ts - click here
The Big Dipper is one of Blackpool's most famous tourist attractions and was built in 1921. But Ian Bell, from Coaster Force, a group dedicated to rollercoasters at theme parks, thinks that shouldn't have been a problem. He said: "It may be an old ride, but that does not mean it is not safe. The older (they are) the more checks they have."

El negocio del secuestro
Los analistas coinciden en que al final s�lo interesa el dinero.
Escribe Tom Hagler, de la BBC
El secuestro se ha convertido en una de las industrias que m�s r�pido crece en el mundo, seg�n el Centro de Pol�tica Exterior (CPE) basado en Londres.
Se estima que se producen unos 10.000 plagios al a�o en todo el mundo.
Los incidentes considerados incluyen hechos como la reciente toma de rehenes en un teatro ruso por parte de rebeldes chechenos hasta la toma de una persona para obtener su dinero.
Alastair Taylor fue secuestrado cuando trabajaba para una petrolera en Colombia.
Pero el secuestro del Obispo Jorge Jim�nez en Colombia volvi� a poner en las primeras planas al centro mundial de este fen�meno.
No hay una lista de incidencia del secuestro pero se sabe que en los primeros lugares est�n M�xico, Brasil, Filipinas y los pa�ses de la ex Uni�n Sovi�tica. Pero Colombia es sin embargo el que ocupa el primer puesto sin lugar a dudas, con 3.000 secuestros -denunciados- por a�o.
Los grupos rebeldes se originaron con la intenci�n de derrocar un gobierno y una ideolog�a, pero la toma de rehenes se ha convertido en parte de su negocio.
Antonio Garc�a debi� abandonar Colombia por la amenaza del secuestro, su padre -due�o de una granja- ya fue tomado en dos oportunidades.
"Como estaba retenido no pod�a ir a buscar el dinero, lo tuvieron que liberar para que pudiera obtenerlo", record� Garc�a. "Es como si a uno le cobraran cuotas. Ellos lo llaman impuesto de guerra".
"Hasta la polic�a dice a uno que pague porque (los rebeldes) son m�s fuertes que el ej�rcito", agreg�.
Peligros cotidianos
Contratan guardaespaldas, compran veh�culos blindados y dejan de salir a divertirse, pero el problema es tan grande (en Colombia) que ya son mayor�a los que han sufrido al menos un intento de secuestro
Antonio Garc�a
El plagio es cuesti�n de todos los d�as en algunas zonas de Colombia.
Garc�a asegura que los colombianos toman precauciones pero muchas veces no son suficientes.
"Contratan guardaespaldas, compran veh�culos blindados y dejan de salir a divertirse, pero el problema es tan grande que ya son mayor�a los que han sufrido al menos un intento de secuestro".
Algunos de los grupos que lo practican lo hacen por motivos pol�ticos pero como dijo Rachel Briggs del CPE, la mayor�a se mueve impulsado por el comercio, reputaci�n y dinero.
"En muchos pa�ses el fen�meno se maneja como si fuera un negocio m�s que como una forma de divulgar un inter�s pol�tico", explic�.
"En Am�rica Latina la mayor�a de los grupos buscan dinero. Seg�n nuestros c�lculos obtendr�an unos US$500 millones al a�o", a�adi� Briggs, cuyo informe "El negocio del Secuestro" es material de referencia para la Canciller�a brit�nica y organizaciones no gubernamentales.
Metas diferentes
Pero incluso si el inter�s �ltimo es el dinero, los distintos grupos tiene diferentes razones para actuar.
"En algunas partes del mundo son s�lo secuestradores. Si, por ejemplo, se mira a M�xico, all� son organizaciones criminales que quieren hacer dinero", dijo Briggs.
"En otras partes del mundo es un poco m�s dif�cil hacer distinciones. Muchos grupos pol�ticos toman rehenes con el fin de obtener dinero que les permitir� impulsar su causa", explic�.
Una mujer exige la liberaci�n del Obispo Jim�nez.
Los secuestradores tambi�n tienen que ocuparse de mantener su reputaci�n, como si fueran una empresa multinacional.
Si toman a una persona y tras recibir el dinero la matan, la pr�xima v�ctima no pagar�.
Y como en cualquier negocio, primero hay que dialogar para llegar a un precio.
"Entregar dinero s� salva vidas (...) pero a veces no queda m�s opci�n que negociar mucho el precio final", explic� Paul Slaughter, negociador experto que trabaj� en �frica y en Am�rica del Sur.

India in awe of Australia
The Indian media has begged the public not to overreact
Australia were hailed as deserving champions by the Indian press on Monday after winning the World Cup final in convincing fashion.
Ricky Ponting's side romped to a 125-run victory after setting 359 batting first at the Wanderers.
In response, the Indian media, rather than pour scorn on its side, was full or praise for the Australians.
World Cup final: Match report
"It's official. The Australians are the best one-day team, the Indians are second best," The Indian Express newspaper said under a front-page headline: "Cup not ours but raise a toast".
The Indian Express added: "Ricky Ponting's men showed there is a gulf separating the
two teams that measures almost twice as much as the distance between Mumbai and Melbourne."
We can look back on South Africa 2003 with fondness, and ahead to West Indies 2007 with hope
The Times of India
Aggers on India
Ponting starred for Australia, smashing a stunning 121-ball 140 not out to effectively wrap up victory for his side.
Glenn McGrath then shone with the ball, taking three wickets for 52 runs, with Brett Lee and Andrew Symonds adding two apiece.
The Hindustan Times conceded that Australia are the "greatest one-day team in history" but called on India fans not to vent their anger against the team.
After a poor start to the tournament, pictures of Indian players were burnt on the sub-continent in a series of violent clashes.
Captain Sourav Ganguly was given a mock funeral and black paint was hurled at
batsman Mohammad Kaif's house in the northern city of Allahabad.
But, The Times of India said, there was no shame in losing to Australia.
"We can look back on South Africa 2003 with fondness, and ahead to West Indies 2007 with hope," it said.
