Death sentences for Morocco bombings
Five simultaneous attacks rocked Casablanca
A Moroccan court has sentenced four men to death in connection with suicide bombings which killed 45 people in Casablanca in May.
The four were among 87 defendants accused of membership of a clandestine, hardline Islamist group called Salafia Jihadia.
The judges found the four guilty of premeditated murder in the five simultaneous attacks on 16 May. The other defendants received sentences ranging from 10 months in jail to life imprisonment, the French news agency AFP reported.
Twelve suicide bombers were among the 45 people who died as a result of the attacks - the 45th on Friday after three months in hospital.
Death sentences were handed down to Mohamed El Omari, 23, Rachid Jalil, 27, Yassine Lahnech, 22 and Hassan Taousi - three of whom were believed to have aborted their own suicide missions.
Reserve bomber
The BBC's Pascale Harter, at the trial, said El Omari was mobbed by passers-by when he fled from the Farah hotel in Casablanca after the explosives he was carrying failed to detonate. The prosecution claimed Jalil and Taousi ran from their intended targets when they heard the first explosion and took fright. Street vendor Lahnech was referred to in the trial as a reserve suicide bomber, recruited to carry out similar attacks elsewhere in the country. All four defendants come from the impoverished Casablanca suburb of Sidi Moumen, which has been identified as a breeding ground for converts to what the authorities say is a form of radical fundamentalism imported from Saudi Arabia.
Taousi was considered to be a leading member of Salafia Jihadia - which advocates violence against US interests and Jews in Morocco.
The authorities believe the group is linked to Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network.
More trials
One of four Islamic clerics appearing before the judges was sentenced to life imprisonment, with the others getting 30-year sentences.
Security at the trial was extremely tight, with defendants
lined up behind a bullet-proof glass shield and a metal
detector in the courtroom. When the verdict was announced, defendants cried "God is great!"
The Moroccan authorities say about 700 suspects will eventually be tried under the country's anti-terrorism laws in connection with the attacks.
A Spanish restaurant, the Belgian consulate, a Jewish community centre and cemetery and a hotel were all targeted in Casablanca.

African view: Shipshape for Obama?
In our series of weekly viewpoints from African journalists, Elizabeth Ohene, a former government minister in Ghana and former BBC journalist, looks forward to US President Barack Obama's visit to her country:We in Ghana are going to have our "Obama Moment" later this week. Forget that talk about Ghana being the second country in Africa President Obama is visiting. We know better. Ghana is a truly admirable example of a place where governance is getting stronger, a thriving democracy
Barack Obama's spokesperson
Africa texts Obama before visit
Africans welcome Obama
That Egypt stopover does not count as a trip to Africa. He did not go there with his wife; he is coming here with Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha. And he will be going to Cape Coast, which has been given a well-deserved makeover. He did not sleep in Cairo and it was obvious he was using the city only as a backdrop to make a speech to the Arab world. True, he is making a big speech here in our parliament aimed at Africa, but this is different. He is coming to Ghana because, to borrow the words of his spokesperson: "Ghana is a truly admirable example of a place where governance is getting stronger, a thriving democracy." Their words, not mine. Jealous prideWe are the envy of the whole continent and as for our cousins the Nigerians, this is the ultimate humiliation. I suspect the president will be begging people this week to demonstrate against his government
Obama snubs Nigeria?
They will never be able to live this one down. Then there is Kenya and I ought to tread gently for there might be some raw emotions here, since there are blood claims. So we sympathise with our Kenyan brothers and sisters, but as the White House sees it, Kenya, like Nigeria simply doesn't make the good governance grade. The trip to Ghana is intentional. It is worth quoting The White House on Ghana again: "An extraordinarily close election, decided ultimately by about 40,000 votes, the country remained peaceful, power was transferred peacefully, and they continue to pursue a development agenda and bolster the rule of law." The Americans probably are aware many in Africa have wondered aloud that a sitting government could not find 40,000 votes to stay in power. With such enthusiastic endorsement, it is not surprising that the government here is over the moon and is milking the Obama magic for all it is worth. The promotions by the Ministry of Information and the Office of the President seek to portray the new Ghana government as being on the same wavelength as the new United States government, both led incidentally by law professors. Big partyIt is a bit tricky trying to liken the charismatic and erudite 47-year-old wordsmith world leader Mr Obama to the halting 64-year-old John Atta Mills, taunted as "dull" by his mentor, ex-President Jerry Rawlings. The Clintons were given a huge welcome 11 years ago
We have consequently run into some very odd incidents. This past week, there was the strange case of the president asking, or maybe, ordering the police to allow a street demonstration by a group that wanted to protest against a litany of things. The police had gone to court and got an injunction to prevent the demonstration on the grounds, among others, that the police were so busy with the planned Obama visit they would not have the manpower to handle a demonstration. Nobody here imagines that President Atta Mills intervened so dramatically to ask that a court order be put aside and the group be allowed to protest because he is dying for people to protest against him. But imagine this: Here is Mr Obama, daily criticising the Iranian government for not allowing its citizens to demonstrate; and here is Ghana, the "admirable example of a thriving democracy" refusing to allow peaceful demonstrations Obviously that would not do. Fluffing linesI suspect therefore that not only will the president be begging people this week to demonstrate against his government; there will be a lull in the frantic denunciations of the former government. No former officials will be stopped at the airport and prevented from leaving the country and no former minister's car will be seized by state security officers on the streets of Accra. My bet is there will be no such drama any more until Mr Obama has been and gone. I have been trying to dream up the most outrageous thing I could get away with in this thriving democracy during Obama week. But the truth is all Ghanaians are really chuffed about the visit and if only the Americans would let us, we would put on such a welcome show, the world would be astounded. After all, this is the country in 1998 that gave Bill Clinton the largest crowd in his life, but then that was in the pre-9/11 world and these days they do not allow American presidents to be exposed to such crowds. All the same, we guarantee to make the trip memorable for the Obamas. At the moment, if we have any anxieties it has to be a collective fear that our president will falter in pronouncing President Obama's name. He seems to fluff his lines on the big occasions, and there is a wicked rumour making the rounds that President Atta Mills has been practising the name of his host, "Bama Obarack, Marack Omaba, President Omarack" We are all willing him on to get it right on the day. A selection of your comments:I am a Zimbabwean and boy am I so jealous of Ghana right now. Imagine Obama visiting us. Wow lucky them. but I guess we asked for that didn't we us Zimbabweans. I cant last remember when we had a President of USA visiting Zimbabwe or a British one come to that. Hopefully in the near future when everything is ironed out neatly we might get a chance to see them here. Otherwise I guess I have to glue my self to the TV and watch BBC, Sky and CNN displaying Obama in Ghana. ps at least some jealousy is eased as I comfort myself and say he is visiting the home of our First First Lady Sally Mugabe . Our cousins welcome him for me.Michelle, HarareMs Ohene I have and will always admire your journalistic prowess. But, as succinctly though as you written this article - there one thing I would like to know? is there any bitterness running between you and the current administration of Mr Atta Mills? You are a former Government Minister - right? Thus, portraying Mr Mills as wanting to appear democratic before Mr Obama's arrival is a step in the wrong direction, I beg to disagree with you but democracy, as the powers that be will want to see, is at play in Ghana,Muctaru Stevens, Berlin, GermanyGhana is Kwame Nkrumah country for us Indians. Reading about the welcome Ghanaians are going to extend to President Barak Obama of USA I am excited and happy. I want to read the full text of his speech to Ghanaians. Going by the address he gave at the Russian New Economic School graduation convocation, Pres. Obama will surely make himself an unforgettable president of America and Ghanaians are deservedly lucky to hear him him speak. Thanks.M Krishnamachary, Mumbai, IndiaI don't see how Nigerians can be upset at this. The mere fact that the author felt the need to refer to Nigeria shows that Ghanaians do recognize that their country is less powerful and important than Nigeria. Just let them have their moment....it won't last for longRabah, LondonI do love Obama , but he should go to these countries in trouble to real understand what is going on. The are DR Congo, Rwanda, Sudan, Angola, Zimbabwe, Kenya... Kib, london UKPresident Obama is welcome in Africa. But whereas he's praising Ghana, there are some Countries on the continent which are key to the USA Strategic interest on many issues such as terrorism, HIV/Aids, environment, and provision of key natural resources. These are part and parcel of good global governance! He would have considered visiting at least five countries spearheading the above US interest in Africa and beyond. Thanks, Dukundane Emmanuel, Kigali, RwandaLOL, this is hilarious. Talk about pride. I don't blame the Ghanaians though. If Obama and co were coming to Nigeria, we wouldn't hear the end of it. Shoot, MJ's news coverage wouldn't even come close!!! So Ghanaians, be prideful that he chose you!!! Means you must be doing something right! Ruby, NIGERIAI am proud to be associated with Ghanaians or living in the country call call Ghana, i have been in Ghana since 1996 and i think that Ghana is one of the best country on the continent and they really deserve a great president visit, life is not all about wealth but peace, love respect for your fello man and that is why i have decided to stay in Ghana, i stay in Lagos for just six months, i decided never to go back. I might likely experience Obama convoy passing infront of me going to cape coast, what a moment that i will never forget, if he don't go by chapel, Ghanaians deserve this moment of my favorite Leader in the world, the GREAT OBAMA PRINCE FALLAH, liberian refugee in ghanaI have faith in this man. President Obama's visit to Ghana has made a lot of people happy. Hopefully he will have some positive economic offers that encouraged fairer trade between Ghana and the USA... If he opens this door in Ghana he will see that the majority of them have a hard working and entrepreneurial character, not too distant from the Americans, moreover they may name that day after him. I'm waiting to see what developments take place after he's left as the proof of the pudding is in the eating. I'm expecting too much am I?Paul Otchere, London, EnglandGhana, Africa is taking pride in hosting the first black President and family of the United States of America through you! We are behind you in prayer and well wishes.Akiror Harriet Ariko, Kampala, UgandaYou can think what you like Elizabeth, Obama's first Presidential visit to Africa was Egypt and we are justifiably proud of that. To say this country is nothing more than a gateway to the Middle East is actually quite insulting. We participate in the majority of sporting and political African nation events and consider ourselves fully integrated into Africa in that respect.Khalid Jamal, Cairo, EgyptI like the commentary it sounds familiar and the blogs all seem so similar. Is this a developing nation scenario where we clean and prepare for the leaders of the developed states. The same sentiments were echoed in Trinidad and Tobago for the visit of the Fifth Summit of the Americas and particularly the presence of President Obama.Antoinette Matthews, St Augustine, Trinidad & TobagoWill the visit bring the much anticipated boost in Ghana's flagging "ecomony", or should say economy? Mills' government should get it right and not fluff it.Samuel Gyamfi, Bracknell, UKHere at home, nobody thinks this is other than a stunt calculated to extend influence to counter China's. The president faces a growing backlash in the USA due to the lingering recession and what many see as high-handed meddling with the Constitution. Let's pray this cynical influence-peddling visit does not leave the hangover that his election did. Pat, Carthage, USAObama's visit to Ghana is NOT in any way Humiliation to Nigeria or any other africa nations.....OBAMA is Not JESUS CHRIST simply a president who chosed and decided to visit Ghana and may decide to Visit Nigeria some day. He can not visit all Africa nations same day same moment, Ghana is down to inferiority complex that makes them to see themselves as Brazil of Africa When Nigeria had beaten the real Brazil in a major football competition.marcel eze, abidjanMy dear writer, we should concentrate more on what unites us than wasting time an energy on trying to whip up sentiments. What does it matter if Obama visit Ghana or Nigeria, better still Togo. We are supposed to be united rather than making claims or utterances that will not engender oneness. A black man is a black man, that should be our ethos. No place in the whole wide world that do not have its problems; we cannot deny the problems of democracy and corruption in Nigeria but all these are surmountable. Our prayers should be how both Ghana and Nigeria or any African country should develop together. When Ghana had its problems in the late 70s they ran to Nigeria. It will be easier and feasible for Ghana to help Nigeria or Nigeria help Ghana, for a non-African country to help. I don't care if is USA, UK or what have you; they are all after their interests. Please wake up!Moses Akinmuyiwa, Birmingham, UKMoses Akinmuyiwa, Birmingham, UK - Your comments are meaningful to Africans. You all have made my DAY.Ahmed Shaibu, LondonGhana wan an obvious choice for President Obama. Numerous African countries have had elections where the opposition won outright but never got seated. Ethiopia, Nigeria, Zimbabwe to name a few. Ghana is one bright exception. Thank You Mr. President for sending a strong message to African despots.Tariku I, Addis Ababa, EthiopiaBravo Ghana, if all africans can do like ghana them there will be no problems like nigeria, kenya and others i wish am in ghana to welcome my humble african bro. African leaders should try and emulate ghana of there good governace so that the continent can enjoy its wonderful resources.halima jatta, banjul the gambiaI am a Liberian, and very happy for the visit of US President Barrack Obama to Ghana. And i hope that the President will make another visit to Nigeria. Nigeria is Africa's super power. All of the blood shells that took place in Liberia, Nigeria was the first African countries that arrived. Especially, in 2003 when we (Liberian) were dying in blood shells, Nigeria was the only and first African countries that came to our aid. So in this light, I will like for President Barrack Obama to pay a special visit to Nigeria. And i also want him to come to Liberia.Sekou S Sheriff, Monrovia, LiberiaI really am disappointed at our Nigerian brothers for crying foul about Obama's visit to Ghana......The secret simply is...good governance, respect for human rights hospitality and above all the home and origin of African Americans...that's what we areNana Tutu Yeboah, AccraMy Ghanaian friend, I am a Nigerian and don't envy Ghana even if President Obama and his disciples visit your country everyday. President Obama is just another American president looking after American interests. In this case, it is your newly acquired oil shores. Your comments justifies my views about Ghanaians. Let me add that Ghana is the same size as Lagos Nigeria if not smaller. Good luck with your thriving democracy and good governance. I am happy that you are basking on something that is already in Africa.Simms, Umuahia, NigeriaSO sorry to see that the fact of choosing Ghana is a source of debate. Wherever Obama visits in Africa, he's a guest of the whole continent. It is high time we stopped thinking as Ghanaians, Nigerians, Senegalese, Kenyans etc. We have to believe and work hard to bring African Unity into reality. Still, let us all congratulate Ghana for the efforts made to implement true democracy and let us hope this example will be followed by the remaining African countries. Ghana, welcome President Obama as a guest of mother Africa, and let him and his family remember that even if we are poor, we know how to treat our guests. ThanksAlphousseyni DIAMANKA, Dakar, SénégalAs we all aware that water always flows following a specific course of its current, the fact that Ghana has demonstrated undisputable state of good governance and democracy throughout the African Continent is a yard stick which has set a precedent in determining the tour of the high profile World leader of this century. Lucas Phillip Kiswizah, Dar es Salaam, TanzaniaHe's just going there because there are US oil interests there. Enough said.Michelle, Dallas, TXNever thought a political piece could be so funny! Thank you, my day is made.Kholofelo, Johannesburg, South AfricaWhom the Lord love He chastise. Obama's refusal to visit Nigeria at this time is a clear body language, demonstrating his love for Nigeria. He say it best when he said nothing at all. It is now left for Nigeria to return Obama's love by amending her ways. King, London, EnglandGhana deserves all the accolades and time in the political limelight. Obama is not naive to Africa's inadequacies. Kenya failed big time to think big and reap from what she deserved. Their primitive politics is so repellent to forward-looking leaders like Obama. Ghana may not be perfect but it is the effort and intention that counts. Nigerians may be smarting from sour grapes but Obama knows the deceptive cord running deep inside. Congrats Ghana and please bask in the sunshine responsible.Taabu, Eldoret, KenyaA mere 40,000 votes unseated an African government!? Wow, a lesson in good governance to all African countries who must choose the rule of law going forward. It took a month plus, to reconcile a huge gap in Zims elections to a 0-0 draw last May, and that for a country that boasts a literacy rate of 90%. Ghana is the cradle for African democracy and its a shame some dictators refer to the legendary Kwame Nkrumah as their inspiration. Obama must use this opportunity to lash out at such leaders, Zim & Kenya included. Gadama N, Bulawayo, ZimI am certainly failing to understand why all the fuss about the President Obama's visit to Ghana. What do people in Ghana and Africa stand to benefit apart from disrupting their businesses? Nothing and this trip will not change Ghanaians lives in any way. Observing and respecting democratic institutions in Ghana has not in anyway been influenced by President Obama.Esperança, LuandaGive Mr Mills a break. Mr Obama probably cant pronounce a number of Ghanaian names. And why couldn't he come to Zambia? Our political tolerance is truly remarkable in my view. And our peacefulness is legend.Rose Phiri, Lusaka, Zambiait is indeed great news that Obama has chosen Ghana as one of the first countries in Africa to visit. the euphoria in the small West African country is so high i suspect Friday might be an unofficial holiday. my only problem is that major businesses will be closed for 48hrs because of Obama's visit and this is going to make a lot of business people lose money running into millions. Is Obama really taking us forward?Selase Attah, AccraAw pulezzzz!!! Whether Obama comes or not, Nigeria is still the giant of Africa. It is okay for Obama to encourage Ghana's democracy. In spite of our current woes we still have a profound influence across Africa. Imagine what happens when we work through our problems....the whole world will come to our door steps. Ono Vu, Abuja-NigeriaTo be sincere, I admired the true democracy in the Republic of Ghana. I live in Ghana for four years consecutive and not a day I was humiliated by any law implementers. Even though some of our Liberian friends once complained of human right abuse but I believe that Ghana being a law abided state, you are only trouble if you trouble the law and that's what make the nation what she is. Ghana, you deserve all the world class leaders visit always.Tamba Kpakima, Monrovia, LiberiaRight on! Absolutely like it is. I haven't read such a cool opinion in a long time, haven't laughed so righteously on 'Bama Obarack'...Andy Zimmermann, Berlin GermanyGhana is a leader in Africa whether people like it or not. Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain independence. Ghana has been holding credible elections. Corruption not rampant. No xenophobia attacks on fellow Africans. Ghana is indeed a BLACK Star. There could be no better country for Obama and family to visit than Ghana. Make us (Africans) proud our dear brothers and sisters in Ghana. If for any reasons you wont host him (Obama), could you recommend MALAWI - The Warm Heart of Africa as an alternative destination. Viva Ghana, Viva Africa.Sam Gonthako Nganjo, Blantyre, MALAWIWhat's the talk about Obama's visit to Ghana being a humiliation on Nigerians and Kenyans? His visit to Egypt to douse the fire of religious fiasco should be considered a political obligation, and that to Ghana; a start point of political tour. That doesn't imply that he's not going to be elsewhere in Africa for the same purpose for which he's in Ghana. After all Ghana hasn't the best political culture and practise in Africa-good governance grade or not, is all a front. Therefore, the amiable president has his reasons for starting with her. So, no noise. Solomon A Akande, Lagos, NigeriaIt is a shame really that the first American Black President will not be visiting Nigeria,(the self-acclaimed giant of Africa) but Ghana, on his first African tour. I hope it is a big lesson to the Nigerian leaders that democracy can truly work in Africa with total commitment and will of the leaders and the citizens alike.OLALEKAN OMOTAYO, LAGOS, NIGERIALoved it! especially the part about Mills begging for demonstrations against him to happen :)Mustapha Hamoui, Tema, GhanaI don't see the humiliation in Obama not visiting Nigeria. Its just a matter of choice. After all important and powerful world leaders, some of who Obama consults over major world issues have visited Nigeria of recent without reaching Ghana. The only difference between him and the other will just be his 'oratory wizardry'.Ekpo Anieteye, Abuja, NigeriaI am happy that Obama is visiting Africa.Nwagwu b nkume, Umuahia NigeriaLucky Ghana, the don't have much stakes in African affairs and they are presently enjoying peace , but they should also remember the sacrifice of other nations and respect what Nigeria has done to the continent and take this as an opportunity to be humble and not be fooled by a mere visit by Obama. Ishmeal, Newton AbbotAs an American who loves living in Mali, I totally get this hilarious piece combining true patriotism along with lingering fears of inferiority (real or perceived). I'm sure Ghana will delight the Obama's and the rest of the continent they will so admirably represent.Gordon Roedding, Bamako, MaliPresident Barack Obama, visit to Ghana though a plus to the thriving peaceful political atmosphere in Ghana, should not be a source of taunt to deride other African nations such as Nigeria and Kenya which the Obama's has not put on their agenda to visit, while the dice rolled let everyone in the comity of nations take their chancesPastor Patrick Ehapa, Limerick IrelandIt's good Obama has skipped my country Kenya. It's time Kenyan leaders stopped outdoing each other and humble themselves and try emulate there brother Barrack Obama. We as African continent should know that the USA govt is not a one man show as our leadership in Africa is. Whatever the USA govt do is questioned by both Republicans and Democrat. Therefore the president wont just visit any country even if he has a blood relation its all about the USA people policy that matters. Louis Kundu, Nairobi KenyaOur Obama moment is here. Nigerians should clean their house before expecting Almighty Obama.Dominic Bitlegma, Accra

End of an era at Panama Canal
President Moscoso and Mr Carter exchange documents
The United States has handed over control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanian people - ending more than 80 years of US occupation of the canal zone. At a ceremony on the banks of the waterway, former American President Jimmy Carter signed over control of the canal and the 10-mile-wide enclave surrounding it. The signing completed a process he began in 1977. He acknowledged that the handover to Panama was not popular in the United States but insisted it was inevitable. We regret very much that President Clinton did not come
President Moscoso
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso, King Juan Carlos of Spain, and various Latin American leaders joined Mr Carter at the celebrations, which started shortly after 1100 local time (1600 GMT) on Tuesday. US President Bill Clinton, who turned away invitations to attend the ceremony, said he was confident that the canal would be safe under Panamanian control. Before the signing ceremony, delegates laid wreaths in two cemeteries containing the remains of workers who died building the canal. More than 400 people died for each of the canal's 50 miles.
Mr Carter began the transfer process more than 20 years ago when he signed a treaty with the then Panamanian leader, General Omar Torrijos, to end American occupation of the Panama Canal Zone at noon on 31 December 1999.
The ceremonial turnover was brought forward to avoid conflict with millennium celebrations.
Perceived snub
The decision by Mr Clinton, his deputy Al Gore, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright not to attend was regarded as a snub by the Panamanians.
President Moscoso said: "We regret very much that President Clinton should not have come to this ceremony, which is a unique, historic ceremony for Panama with the United States.

"It represents our struggle over many years for sovereignty and to have control over the Panama Canal."
Correspondents said conservatives in the US have numerous concerns about the transfer, including security guarantees. These are likely to have increased following an assault by Colombian guerrillas on a naval base at Jurado, close to Panama's border, on Sunday, which left 45 marines dead.
Another fear was that the Hong Kong-based shipping company that won the contract to operate the port facilities had close ties to Beijing.
President Clinton said the US would continue to work with Panama to safeguard the canal's security.
"Today's ceremony underscores our confidence in the government of Panama and the Panamanian people's ability to manage this vital artery of commerce."
Significant waterway
The relationship between the US and Panama dates back to 1903, when Panama gained independence from Colombia. A canal line handler takes a nap
French engineers had started the canal project in 1880, but gave up after a decade. The Americans took over the project in 1904 in return for backing Panama's independence movement, and the waterway opened 10 years later.
The canal cuts thousands of miles off sea journeys between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, raising ships from one ocean and depositing them in the other through a system of water locks and a man-made lake.
Some 14,000 ships pass through the canal every year, and pay $540m in tolls.

EastEnder crowned ballroom champ
Jill Halfpenny had been favourite to win Strictly Come Dancing
EastEnders actress Jill Halfpenny has been crowned the celebrity winner of BBC talent show Strictly Come Dancing. Along with professional partner Darren Bennett, she wowed the judges and audience with three different dances. Halfpenny, 29, beat athlete Denise Lewis and comic Julian Clary, whose popularity rather than dancing ability secured his place in the final.
The final trio were whittled down from a starting line up of 10 couples, who included Esther Rantzen and Aled Jones.
The winner was decided by a combination of voting by professional ballroom dance judges and a public phone vote. Halfpenny impressed the judges with her jive to Sir Elton John's I'm Still Standing, which brought the series first full marks. Halfpenny, who stars as Kate Mitchell, in EastEnders, had been the bookmakers' favourite all week.
Clary's routines were not popular with the judges
She takes over the crown from BBC News presenter Natasha Kaplinsky, who went on to co-present this series alongside Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly.
The series has once again proved a ratings success with viewing figures topping those of last year. More than seven million votes were cast during the series, raising �850,000 for Children in Need.
A Christmas special, Strictly Come Dancing On Ice, will air later this month with former England goalkeeper David Seaman, Liberty X's Jessica Taylor and EastEnders actress Scarlett Johnson taking part.

NHS revamp to 'push up standards'
By Nick Triggle
Health reporter, BBC News
The government wants to drive up standards
The coalition government has promised to revamp the health service in a bid to "drive up standards".The policy document, which covers this parliament, promises to give people choice over which GP they want. A special fund will also be set aside to pay for cancer drugs patients are struggling to get prescribed. The coalition document also revealed it would set up an independent board to run the health service, while patients will be directly elected on to trusts. This reflects a merging of policies as the Conservatives had championed the independent board - to allocate funds and advise local managers - while the Liberal Democrats wanted public representation on primary care trusts, which manage local services. However, the document promised no top-down reorganisations - the number of health authorities and trusts has been changed three times in the past decade. Interest to patientsBut it is the measures directly affecting front-line services which will be of most interest to patients. • It seems likely some of the A&E units and maternity wards earmarked for closure will be reviewed after the document promised to stop the "centrally dictated closures". • Patients are also to be given choice over which GP they want to register with. This is something all three parties were keen on and comes after suggestions doctors operate "gentlemen's agreements" by refusing to take on patients from other GPs' lists. • A single urgent care number will be introduced. This is designed to relieve the pressure on A&E services during out-of-hours in particular. It will allow patients with non-life threatening conditions and injuries to contact GPs, walk-in centres and pharmacy services. • A cancer drugs fund - trailed by the Tories before the election - will be established from savings made by stopping the rise in national insurance employer contributions. The aim is to allow patients backed by their doctors to access drugs that they cannot get on the NHS. ANALYSIS
By Nick Triggle, health reporter It is not so much what is in the coalition policy document, rather what is not. The government was always going to struggle to agree on every aspect of policy and health is no different. Tory and Lib Dem health spokesmen - Andrew Lansley and Norman Lamb - spent the election campaign clashing over everything from social care to targets. The Lib Dems were much closer to Labour on those issues and it seems the gap has proved unbridgeable - at least for the moment. The two parties were miles apart in regards to social care and this has been effectively parked with the parties promising to set up a commission to look at the issue. But for those working in the field that will sound like a case of déjà vu as Labour set up a similar group in the late 1990s and still failed to reform the system before their 13 years of power ended. In the NHS, the number one concern is cuts. And while it is easy to promise saving A&Es, giving choice over GPs and setting up a cancer fund, the question still remains - how will the government pay for all this?
Q&A: Health plans
Nigel Edwards, of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, said: "We have an interesting combination of Lib Dem and Conservative policies which in the long-term can make some radical changes." The document also gave details of where the government was aiming to save money in the health service. It said the number of quangos would be "significantly cut" and the cost of administration reduced by a third. However, staff on the front-line warned earlier this week that the savings being talked about - £20bn over three years - would make it inevitable that doctors and nurses would be hit and patient care suffer as a result. These savings are needed despite the government promising to raise the budget above inflation - the NHS needs more money just to stay still because of rising demands from the ageing population, price of drugs and lifestyle problems such as obesity. However, the document also reveals some of the areas where firm agreements do not seem to have been possible. On social care, a commission has been promised to look at how the system is funded. It will report within a year and comes after the Tories backed a voluntary insurance scheme, whereas the Lib Dems preferred universal payments, saying experience showed opt-in schemes were "unworkable". In the lead up to the election, the Tories had also promised to end the target culture created by Labour. But the document makes no specific promises on this, just saying that the government will seek to measure "health results that really matter". There was also very little detail about public health. The Tories had wanted to rebrand the Department of Health the Department of Public Health, while the Lib Dems had championed minimum alcohol pricing. Neither of these are in, although there is reference to tackling cut-price selling of booze. But Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said: "This document sets out a clear message to the NHS. "That our united vision is for a healthcare system which achieves outcomes that are amongst the best in the world, and free from day-to-day political interference." Professor Chris Ham, of the King's Fund health think-tank said the agreement was "good news". But he added: "Nevertheless, the NHS still faces a productivity gap if it is to maintain quality and avoid cutting services. "Ministers and NHS leaders will need to take very difficult decisions in the months and years ahead, and it will be critical that they maintain an honest dialogue with the public." Dr Hamish Meldrum, of the British Medical Association, said: "Enabling patients to register with any GP practice they want will, in reality, be very complex, potentially more expensive and could threaten that important relationship between a doctor and his or her patients."

Call to jail fewer young offenders
Courts are urged to be consistent in sentencing
Courts are being urged to send fewer young offenders to prison because youth jails are close to bursting point. The chairman of the Youth Justice Board, Lord Warner, has written to every youth court in England and Wales calling for greater use of community penalties for 15 to 17-year-olds.
Every effort is being made to make full use of the new range of community penalties available in the youth court
Harry Mawdsley, Magistrates' Association
And he says wide regional variations in sentencing policy means that there is currently "justice by geography".
Lord Warner said short three-month sentences left little time for rehabilitation while they disrupted young people's lives.
There was good evidence that community penalties were more effective, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Community sentences
More intensive surveillance and supervision programmes could be used to deal with more persistent young offenders "who need to be brought up with a jolt", he said.
"You can use tagging, voice verifications frequent visits to their homes and structured programmes in the community," he said.
This is resulting in a significant element of 'justice by geography', which is inherently unfair
Lord Warner
"These are likely to be more effective than taking them away for short periods often 50 to 100 miles away from their home areas into custody."
In the year to March, 6,600 detention and training orders were imposed on 15 to 17-year-olds, with half of the sentences often served in prison and half in the community. Lord Warner says community programmes will save money and ease the pressure on the youth justice system, whose young offenders' institutions are currently running at 96% capacity. Regional differences
He criticised the wide regional differences in sentencing policy.
In Wales, for example, Merthyr Tydfil handed out equal numbers of custodial and community sentences, while Pembrokeshire saw one jail term for every 42 community punishments.
Prison to community sentence ratio
Merthyr Tydfil: 1:1
Kensington and Chelsea: 1:2
Slough: 1:2
Northumberland: 1:36
Solihull: 1:27
Pembrokeshire: 1:42
"This is resulting in a significant element of "justice by geography", which is inherently unfair," he said.
There was also a rise in the number of custodial sentences for young offenders, although the number of serious offences has fallen from 25,035 (in the three months to June 2000) to 21,916 (in the three months to March this
year).
Chairman of the Magistrates Association, Harry Mawdsley, said there were variations in sentencing patterns from one part of the country to another, but there were also variations in youth offending patterns.
He said the association was concerned and determined to reduce variations to a minimum.
"Every effort is being made to make full use of new penalties available in the youth court," he told Today.
"Large numbers of youngsters in custody is a result of the government's success in reducing the period between arrest and sentence from 142 days in 1997 to close to target of 71 days at present time."

Bomber flies in Dambusters tribute
Lancaster bombers flew the raid
Britain's only surviving operational Lancaster bomber is taking to the air to mark Friday's 60th anniversary of the Dambusters raid.
The Dambusters 617 Squadron was formed in 1943 after warplane designer Barnes Wallis developed the bouncing bomb. It was designed to spin backwards at 500rpm, skipping over torpedo nets, before detonating against dams in enemy territory. A weekend celebrating the skill and bravery of the aircrews centres around Brooklands Museum in Weybridge, Surrey, where Wallis and his team worked. A key member of the team, Norman "Spud" Boorer, who worked at Brooklands for many years, will open a Dambusters exhibition.
The 87-year-old remembers the raid "as if it was yesterday".
Low-level attack
"You felt you had played at least a part in doing something useful in the war," he told BBC News.
Some 19 Lancaster bombers of 617 Squadron, each with a crew of seven men, took part in the raid to knock out German electricity and water supplies.
The low-level attack targeted the Mohne, Eder and Sorpe dams in the Ruhr, near Dortmund, which were vital to Germany's industrial production. The raid was deemed a success as the destruction of the Mohne and Eder dams caused widespread flooding and disruption of rail, road and canal communications. Shot down
But it came at a high cost.
An estimated 1,294 people drowned, while 53 aircrew were killed and three, two of whom were badly injured, taken prisoner.
Four of the Lancasters are thought to have been shot down.
Pilot dazzled
Two are believed to have crashed after hitting electricity cables.
One is thought to have hit a tree after its pilot was dazzled by a searchlight. And one is believed to have crashed after being damaged by the explosion of its own bomb.
Another two of the planes failed to drop their bombs.
Dams rebuilt
One had to turn back after being badly damaged by anti-aircraft fire.
Another had its bomb torn off after flying too close to the water.
Wing Commander Guy Gibson was awarded the Victoria Cross, and 34 other men received decorations.
The dams were rebuilt within months.

Rival clubs will share new site
The new development will include facilities for corporate hospitality
Boston United have revealed they want to move rivals Boston Town FC to their new out-of-town sports complex. Computer images of the new stadium were released at a news conference at the Princess Royal Sports Arena on the Boardsides on Monday.
Consultants were commissioned by the club to decide whether Boston should stay at York Street or relocate.
The �8m development will include a new ground for United, a hotel, and separate facilities for Boston Town FC. New headquarters
Pilgrims chairman John Sotnick told BBC News Online the club was more than �1m in debt and losing more than �300,000 per season in corporate hospitality.
He added: "It's about increasing facilities for the community in general. "It will provide community football pitches, cr�che facilities, an increased incremental learning centre, a restaurant and corporate hospitality facilities including 10 executive boxes."
The Pilgrims expect to move to their new home in about four years' time. The club is considering knocking down its existing York Street ground for residential redevelopment once the move to the new ground is completed.

Is gingerism as bad as racism?
By Finlo Rohrer
BBC News Magazine
A red-haired family claims to have been driven from their Newcastle home because of abuse. Why is the harassment of redheads dismissed as just harmless fun?
Here's a joke. "What's the difference between a terrorist and a redhead?"
Here's the punchline. "You can negotiate with a terrorist."
I was on the Tube, pregnant, and I was really humiliated by this drunk yob
Red-haired photographer Charlotte Rushton
Is this offensive? If it was made in your workplace, within hearing of a redheaded colleague, would you make a fuss? Probably not.
But mock someone's ethnicity, religion or sexuality and you will attract the beady eye of management. Make a sexist joke and prepare to be dismissed as an antediluvian relic. Verbal abuse
Carrot-top, copper-top, ginger-nut, ginger minger, bluey (among Australians), Duracell, Ronald McDonald, Simply Red, Queen Elizabeth. And so on for hours and hours of the typical redhead's life. No wonder some gloss over their hair colour as "auburn" and "strawberry blonde" and even "titian". Photographer Charlotte Rushton has been chronicling the UK's redheads for a book, Ginger Snaps. Of the 300 she snapped, only two have been spared bullying because of their hair. She herself has suffered verbal abuse from complete strangers. LEGENDARY REDHEADS
King David
Queen Boudicca
Pharaoh Ramses II
Henry VIII and his daughter Elizabeth I
Sir Winston Churchill
"I was on the Tube, pregnant, and I was really humiliated by this drunk yob. He was shouting 'do the cuffs and the collars match?' He got right up into my face. You don't do that to other people."
She believes the phenomenon is long-standing and uniquely British in its most virulent form. "In other countries redheads will get teased at school but it stops when they become adults. If you are a woman you are fiery and alluring, beautiful." In adult life, women get stereotyped and red-haired men take much of the worst abuse. Treatment of red-haired children in school ranges from mild taunts to grim persecution. Michele Eliot, the American director of British children's charity Kidscape, regularly has significant numbers of red-haired children in courses on coping with bullying.

"There is nothing like this in the US where having red hair is not a precursor to having someone abuse you. Red hair is considered glamorous."
Bullies at school and in later life may sense that ill-treatment of the red-haired will not be treated as seriously by the authorities as persecution of other groups.
"Bullies think that person is outside the norm, they will be able to attack them. The bullies find something to pick on. The bully has a problem and needs a victim," Ms Eliot says. Racism row
While there has been at least one report of a serious anti-red hair hate crime in the UK - a 20-year-old stabbed in the back in 2003 - it's unclear whose responsibility it is to monitor discrimination.
RED HAIR ROOTS
Caused by mutated MC1R gene
Most prevalent in far northern and western Europe
May have survived due to increased vitamin D production in pale-skinned
'Sexual selection' also possible
Disagreement over redheads' reputed higher pain tolerance
"It is certainly not us," says the Commission for Racial Equality.
Conservative backbencher Patrick Mercer, when recently sacked for alleged racism, sought to get himself out of a hole by comparing treatment of black soldiers to those with red hair. "That's the way it is in the Army. If someone is slow on the assault course, you'd get people shouting: 'Come on you fat bastard, come on you ginger bastard, come on you black bastard.'" One of these three epithets would now be regarded as totally unacceptable, and possibly against the law. Even the first, mocking someone's weight, is under a sustained assault from feminists and those concerned about what society's treatment of weight issues does to vulnerable teenagers. But the abuse can be far from innocuous. "We talk about kicking racism out of sport but this is just as bad in its way," said Reading striker Dave Kitson in 2005. He can't have been delighted when the Daily Star reported his remarks under the headline "Kitson's a right ginger whinger". Or when players' association chief Gordon Taylor said: "It belittles racism to compare the two issues."
RED HAIR MYTHOLOGY
Redheads sacrificed in ancient Egypt
Associated with witches and vampires in Europe
Reputed to bleed more
Mary Magdalene, Adam, Judas and even Jesus depicted as redheads Journalist Sharon Jaffa - also a red-head - says society must stop its ginger-baiting.
"Growing up as a redhead I was lucky enough to escape with just the occasional name-calling - having the surname Jaffa was no doubt a double-whammy. But attacking someone on the basis of their hair colour can be every bit as damaging as persecuting someone for their race or religion, and therefore, in some cases, needs to be taken just as seriously."
Red hair has great cultural resonance. Red is the colour of heat, danger and warnings. When applied to women, it is the colour of sensuousness, fiery temperament and emotional instability. "Lilith [Adam's lover] was a redhead. It indicates red hair was bad. Shakespeare made all his most menacing characters wear red wigs. That seeps into culture," Ms Rushton says. Stress release
So when does this date from? Some claim it could be a throwback to anti-Irish sentiment from the 19th Century and before when the Irish, with a greater prevalence of red hair, were regarded as ethnically inferior. Anecdotally at least, males get more abuse than females
Patrick O'Sullivan, head of the Irish Diaspora Research Unit, says he has never come across a link. "People could feel forbidden to attack their usual victims and are searching around for ones that have not yet achieved the protection of the law."
Professor Larry Ray, a sociologist at the University of Kent and an expert on racial discrimination, says the perpetrators could be habitual bullies. "If they are engaging in one kind of harassment they are engaging in others. They are looking for targets."
For those who claim their workplace taunts are just harmless banter, it could be stress rather than an anthropological aversion to red hair.
Workplace psychologist Professor Cary Cooper, of Lancaster University, says abuse can be "an unhealthy release valve for stress" and redheads, as a visible minority not protected by law, have become a target. While other forms of the discrimination are the subject of marches, lobbying and education campaigns, redheads cannot expect the arrival of the politically correct cavalry anytime soon.
Below is a selection of your comments.
The only time the colour of my hair was referred to was by my art teacher at school who would call me carrot top. Personally I just thought that he was ridiculous, as carrot tops are green not red.Helen, Milton Keynes
Redheads are feared because they are believed in folklore to be the devil's children and have red hair because they were conceived during their mother's menstruation.A welsh proverb says "os bydd goch, fe fydd gythreulig" or "if he's redhaired then he is of the devil". Yesterday's superstition has become today's teasing. L, Wales
Well clearly it's wrong to be prejudiced againt a person because of their hair colour. Just as it's wrong to persecute someone for any other reason - because they're fat, or wear glasses, or support Man United, or work in McDonalds, or have bad skin, or listen to Daniel Bedingfield, or play in a 'drum circle'... But it's also 'funny', just as mocking Welsh people is funny. Racism is something completely different, historically and socially. The whole argument is complete twaddle.Katy, Yorkshire
I oppose "bluey" being included as some of a red-head's taunts. In Australia, this isn't a prejudiced comment, it is a term of endearment. As an Australian living in London, I do not comprehend the prejudice surrounding red-head's. A red-head woman is considered beautiful down under! Laurel, London
I think red haired men are gorgeous and sexy! If we only had more where we live... export them to the south of Europe, we would welcome them all!Vina, Lisbon
I did not (could not) understand the joke in the article so it was neither funny nor sad, but to all you redheads the world over, I think you are blessed. I am a black woman and you cannot even begin to understand the silly 'jokes' I have to put up with based on my race and my accent. And I think I am blessed. All others are just 'ordinary'.Katherine, London
Being one of red-haired identical twins, my sister and I were forever being teased at school. There were howls of laughter when we said we did not have red hair but were were "strawberry blonde". For a time it may have affected us but now in our 50s we realise how lucky we are, hardly any grey hairs and very healthy manes of hair to the envy of much younger females.Jennifer Nasser, Heathfield, East Sussex
I grew up in London. I had red hair - auburn really (before it went grey)- my mother was always trying to emulate it from a bottle of dye, but no success. Sometimes I was called 'ginger' - but it was not said aggressively or unkindly, it was just a title. Then in 1969, I went to work in Italy and some of my colleaugues called me 'rosso' - they all had black or dark brown hair. They used it as a term of affection, not as an insult. I find it strange that anyone should be abused for the colour of their hair. Perhaps the best defence is simply to shrug and respond, 'So what!'. Donald Morrison, Lochgilphead, Scotland
Ahem... would I be the only bloke to confess to having a fancy for long, red, curly hair. Gorgeous.Brian, Ipswich
I grew up in Malta where ginger hair is put in the same bracket as blonde, both considered rare and desirable as being different from the more prevalent Mediterranean dark. I didn't understand the British attitude towards red-heads when I first moved here and I still don't....and now I've married a red-head rugby-player type, I defy anyone to insult him to his face!Fiona Scerri-Headley, London, UK
The redhead thing does not happen in the US. I have red hair and never got teased. I spent years getting tormented for a physical disability. The monsters at Oley Valley School District would definitely have mentioned my hair too if that was a normal thing in the US.Barb, Philadelphia, USA
In primary school I would tell boys my red hair was actually gold, and if they married me they would be rich forever! Boys (although 5 years old!) fell for it! As soon as I got a little bit older, the bullying started. I have been spat at, as well as physically and verbally abused in the street because of the colour of my hair. Abuse is abuse, whether sexist, racist, because of the colour of someones skin or because of the colour of someones hair, and abuse should never be tolerated.Hannah Smith, High Wycombe
I'm a blonde woman and believe it or not a day doesn't go by when I have to contend with "dumb blonde" jokes either by the media or at work. It is seen as very amusing to call blonde people, particularly women I hasten to add, unintelligent, bimbos and clumsy. Where did that image come from? I'll tell you where, the media again! Another negative fictional image they have decided to use over and over again. I don't exactly feel that it has often been a personal vendetta against me but it doesn't half annoy me when I feel I'm fairly intelligent and deep-thinking most of the time!
Grow up Great Britain.Adele, Birmingham
Last year I took my eleven year-old daughter Georgia to the naval base in Portsmouth where we took a guided tour of a submarine. Unfortunately the guide was a bit of an old sea dog and kept on referring to my daughter as ginger. I could see that she was embarrassed and I was embarrassed for her. However, we both felt even sorrier for the German visitors who were rudely dismissed by the same man.
Being "folicularly challenged", I would laugh at being called "baldy", but times have chnaged to such a ridiculous level due to political correctness, that kids just can't do anything without being challenged or corrected!Peter Moore, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England
Tristan from Chatham - I don't know what the origin of the 'South Park' episode was, but as an American, I can assert that what the article stated about the lack of prejudice against people with red hair in the US is correct. 'Ginger' is not a term used there to describe redheads, so perhaps Trey Parker (the writer) is familiar with the bias here. No doubt American kids are teased for having red hair, but no more so than any other kids are teased for anything else (name, size, glasses, etc). I was very surprised when I moved to England to find that having red hair would make anyone subject to taunts and discrimination. It is equally as absurd as all other forms of prejudice, which expose the insecurity, meanness and stupidity of those who are guilty of harboring them.CP, London, UK
I am honestly shocked that such idiocy prevails in a country normally so reasonable. There is a line between teasing and harassment, and the British evidently cross it. In the States we often tell blond jokes, but I've never heard of a blond actually being offended, much less changing their address. Peter, Seattle, USA
As the proud bearer of a mighty crop of red hair, I should like to remind the mousey coloured masses that on the two occasions during the last 500 years that this country was most in peril, redheads, namely Elizabeth I and Winston Churchill stepped up and met the challenge, of the Spanish Armada and the Nazis respectively. So enjoy your japes and easy insults if you will, but remember that fact the next time a redhead saves the nations's collective skin!Gavin Happe , Ilford, Essex
I'm a 25 year old ginger female and I am amazed that grown men still feel compelled to shout �Ginger� at me, usually from the safety of a passing white van. But its not all bad, sometimes they can even be flattering. I�ve had my fair share of teasing - the references to different bodily parts are unacceptable but you deal with it. Claire, Manchester
I cannot begin to describe, as a redhead, just how offensive I find the term "ginger". Yet I've heard colleagues and friends use it freely in conversation in reference to a redheaded individual or even direct to my face without batting an eyelid. Maybe they don't realise that years of verbal, and occasionally physical, abuse can be recalled in an instant with the utterance of that one word. I have long felt that such a term should be treated with the same seriousness as those used negatively to describe someone's ethnicity, race, etc. I also have to add that I've lost count of the number of times I've had the same comment as Charlotte Rushton had on the tube. What's even worse is when the people around actually smile as though the stupid oaf in question had made some intellectually witty comment. If I say anything in response, to this or any other redheaded insult, I clearly can't take "a joke." However, I wouldn't change my colouring for anything. It is a part of me and my identity and I love its natural uniqueness. Jo Hobbs, Leicester, UK
I speak as the proud fiancee of a gorgeous red-haired man. My "type" has always been those of a red haired persuasion and I have never encountered any blatent rudeness about any of my boyfriends, although I have been questioned by friends about what I find so attractive. Sadly as we begin to discuss starting a family the same friends are counselling against our procreation lest we produce "ginger babies". Claire Knowles, Truro, Cornwall
I was surprised and angry when I heard seemingly intelligent people objecting to Patrick Mercer's comments on the radio and TV implying that there was no comparison with calling someone a black bastard and a ginger bastard - that somehow a racial slur was a sacking offence whereas the other was not worthy of consideration. Personaly although I agree with Patrick Mercer that the army and real life isn't perfect I think that bullying is wrong whatever colour, race or orientation you are. Certainly I have thoughtlessly used deprecating words to describe red haired people in the past - I shall on reflection try to do better in the future in case I cause them any personal angst.
Jamie Taylor, Soho, London
People get teased for all sorts of reasons (too skinny, bald, fat, accent, etc.). Racism is particularly requgnant because of it's historical resonance. This kind of teasing is a different matter entirely. Attacking people verbally is out of order on whatever grounds, but let's not make more and more special cases.Jonny, Glasgow
My ex-husband's hair is pure ginger. He has the notorious freckles, the lot! No one else in his family (alive) has ginger hair. His dad used to tease him when he was a kid, to build up his resistance to the teasing that is dad knew he was going to get once he started school. My ex husband said that when he started school, he had heard all the names that were called him and even dared them to try and come up with some new ones! He took it in his stride and as an adult, he still gets the odd comment, but all in the fun of the moment.Steph, Coventry, England
I'de like to know where and when the term 'ginger' became associated with people with red hair. The root ginger is beige, at the most yellow. How does this resemble red hair in any way?rufus flack, england
I'm a redhead, of the auburn persuasion, and believe me, if someone taunts me about my colouring, they'll soon find out why redheads are reputed to have fiery tempers. I realised when I was still at school that that was the only way to deal with bullies - and it worked. And continues to work. It's time more redheads did the same - stop cringing and start standing up for yourselves! Red and Proud!Annia, UK
Surely racism is evil because it's a form of prejudice. It isolates an individual or group from the rest of society whether they are Asian, black, Jewish. But to do the same because that person is overweight, has red hair, has large nose etc is no less cruel. The emphasis should not be on racism, Islamophobia or whatever. All prejudice should be outlawed.Mark, Liverpool
As a child growing up I would often get into fights at school. My brothers who didn't have red hair, never did. I was constantly mocked infront of teachers and they did nothing. Bullying is bullying whether it is due to race, weight, height, wearing glasses, sex, sexually orientation or hair colour. Its just okay to do it because of hair colour.Ian Watt, London
As a white redhead, I would agree that racism is different from "gingerism" - redheads have not suffered centuries of systematic abuse ranging from slavery to institutional racism. Abuse of redheads is usually personal and does not, for example, affect our life or job prospects. However, I would say that I have experienced abuse (although not so much as an adult) and I was mightily relieved that none of my children have turned out to have red hair and so they will not have to suffer similar abuse.
Rachel Pearce, Matlock, England
I have long red hair and the guys at work constantly pickup on this fact, but mention someone from a different race with black or brown skin colour and they clam up and get hideously embarressed that someone would dare even mention something along those lines. Its complete double standards and although it doesn't get to me personally it must be classed as being just as bad as "racism" if not another form of it.Paul May, Southampton England
Gingerism is not the same as racism!! To prejudice against someone on the basis of their skin colour/race depicts a far more dangerous hatred. Somehow i don't think 'ginger nut' is exactly in the same league as some of the more 'colourful' lingo directed at most non-whites, in their daily lives. Dr Ami, Manchester
Growing up in an Irish Catholic community in London in the 70s, my ginger hair didn't get me singled out for attention. However, I feel spiteful hostility to gingers is definitely on the rise. The lack of challenge allows people who enjoy being horrible about other people, but can't any more to other groups, to get away with it, from individuals to businesses and advertisers. The criticism of Steve McClaren shows this: a caller to a BBC phone-in described him as "a typical useless ginger bloke", and this ridiculous comment went unremarked by the host. Because of this unchecked cruelty, I'm relieved none of my children are ginger.Stephen Martin, London
I'm not sure that the statement "There is nothing like this in the US where having red hair is not a precursor to having someone abuse you. Red hair is considered glamorous." is entirely accurate. I recently watched the South Park (season 9) episode entitled "Ginger Kids" which tactfully deals with the subject, but indicates the same prejudice occurs in the US.
Tristan, Chatham
It is not a coincidence that the English regularly stereotype the Irish and Scottish as ginger haired. Russ Abbot made his name with this type of "humour". Of course it's as bad as racism - and it often is racism.Dougie, London, UK
I'm 20 now and since school I have only been subjected to red-hair-based abuse from misbehaving children and unintelligent idiots who can't think of any wittier or relevant insults. It strikes a nerve because of the hard time I had as a ginger child but isn't even in the same league as racism. Children will always find something to be cruel to each other over and only a few unfortunate adults don't grow out of it.Mike Assenti, Bristol, England
That joke at the top of the article is surely too rubbish to be offensive.Gareth, Frome
Having survived the occasional hair colour related taunting of the school play ground and mandatory nicknaming while in the army, I now celebrate the colour of my hair. We, The Ginger, should rebuke any torments from those unfortunate to suffer the insecurities of the mousey masses, and explain to them that it is only their inability to articulate a more inteligent banter that leads them to choose pick on the one feature of us that makes us superior to them. We should pity those who think it is right to try to bully us, because they will more than likely be bald before us.David Cunningham, Bognor Regis
My gorgeous husband has ginger hair and I tell him 'Once you've done ginger you never go back'. I have loads of affectionate names for him such as 'my little ginger freak of nature', 'ginge' and 'ginog'. Unfortunately, my three year old daughter picked up on the first one and now regularly shouts 'ginger freak' at my husband! It is all done in our house with love and affection and my husband has long since accepted his hair colour and is proud of it. He reckons that ginger people are the superior race and he'd be absolutely right. Up those gingas!Julie, Gateshead
I've got red curly hair, and grew up at the time "Annie" was out at the pictures - thanks to all the teasing at school, I still hate that film! Recently a beggar who I refused to give money to called me an "F****** ginger b****. In my experience red hair makes you an easy target for insults, bullies and hurtful remarks.Joanne Bentley, Manchester

Fears over pylons in beauty spots
Pylons transfer power from wind farms to the National Grid
Snowdonia and Anglesey could be among five UK beauty spots spoilt if plans to build pylons over 170 miles of the countryside go ahead, say campaigners.
An alliance of countryside campaign groups want the UK Government to invest in smart electricity networks instead. They are concerned about what the 50m (164ft) high pylons will look like and their environmental impact. The Department for Energy said any development of the grid would take countryside protection into account. There are currently around 22,000 high voltage pylons carrying 4,375 miles of overhead lines in England and Wales. A recent report for the government said £4.7bn should be spent on the National Grid in order to transport the green energy needed to help meet the UK's target to produce 15% of the UK's energy from renewables by 2020. However the campaign groups say this will mean transmitting energy through some of the country's most protected landscapes, as much of the wind energy will be generated in remote areas of Scotland or off the coast of Wales. Nothing scars our landscapes more than huge electricity transmission lines marching across them
Peter Ogden, director Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales
As well as Snowdonia, four designated areas of outstanding natural beauty, in Anglesey, Kent, Lincolnshire and Somerset would be affected by the new lines. The existing traditional network will also need to be upgraded to accommodate electricity from new power stations, including nuclear, the report by the Electricity Networks Strategy Group for the government said. The Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales (CPRW) is among an alliance of groups aiming to influence a government's plan for a 'smart grid' and a new national planning policy on the future of the nation's electricity transmission network. The smart grid would have less impact on the countryside, said the groups. Peter Ogden director of CPRW said smart grids would see localised electricity produced and distributed at a more local level. "It has been piloted in a number of countries both in Italy and even President Obama is looking at this approach in America," he said. The alliance's manifesto calls for measures to reduce demand on the main electricity transmission grid, including smart meters, encouragement for community and small-scale local energy generation, and further research on methods of storage of electricity. It also wants any new high voltage transmission lines to avoid areas of outstanding natural beauty, national parks, world heritage sites and green belt land. In addition, it is calling for new offshore wind farms to be connected to the National Grid using underground cables to existing substations. Green energy
Mr Ogden said: "Nothing scars our landscapes more than huge electricity transmission lines marching across them. "Developing the smart grid approach offers the long overdue opportunity to link modern methods of energy creation and transmission, with avoiding damage to distinctive upland panoramas and open spaces." A spokesman for the Department for Energy and Climate Change said the new grid lines would be necessary to get new green energy to homes and businesses. "However, it's far too early to say precisely which routes may be proposed for the development of new grid lines," he said. "National Grid will bring forward detailed proposals in due course that will be subject to careful consideration by the relevant consenting authority, which would include considering all environmental aspects of a project. "As part of this process individuals and local communities will have the opportunity to express their views on developments in their area."

La enfermedad del Papa
El Papa ley� plegarias durante una ceremonia de dos horas sin muestras de fatiga.
A pesar de ver disminuidas sus capacidades por los efectos de la enfermedad de Parkinson, Juan Pablo II ha podido seguir con las actividades programadas durante el mes dedicado a celebrar sus 25 a�os como Sumo Pont�fice de la Iglesia Cat�lica.
Las informaciones que corrieron sobre un agudo empeoramiento de su salud o incluso sobre la inminencia de su muerte, especialmente por parte de dos de sus cardenales en el Vaticano, fueron prematuras -y a pesar de que el Papa, de 83 a�os, se encuentra fr�gil, se siente determinado a continuar.
Juan Pablo II cree que est� enviando una se�al a todo el mundo sobre las posibilidades de la gente enferma y mayor, demostrando que todav�a son valiosos y que no deber�an ser apartados, seg�n dice el corresponsal de la BBC en Roma.
A pesar de que el Papa sufre de una enfermedad degenerativa, que est� afectando profundamente su desempe�o, no deber�a ser subestimado y podr�a continuar con su trabajo durante meses o incluso a�os, seg�n el corresponsal de la BBC.
En el Vaticano existe una atm�sfera de agradecimiento porque el Papa ha podido mantenerse a cargo de la Iglesia durante tanto tiempo, uno de los papados m�s largos de la historia.
Recientemente visit� Pompeya y el domingo 5 de octubre concelebr� una misa en las escaleras de la Bas�lica de San Pedro, en Roma.

Arsenal star Samir Nasri primed for Barcelona challenge
UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUEVenue: Nou Camp Date: Tuesday, 8 March Kick-off: 1945 GMT Coverage: BBC Sport website, BBC Radio 5 live and Live on Sky Sports 1
Nasri has made 112 appearances since joining Arsenal from Marseille in 2008
By David Ornstein
Samir Nasri has never been one to lack faith in his own ability but it was not until he came face-to-face with Arsene Wenger that he realised just how far he could go.So far, in fact, that the talented kid who learned his trade on the streets of Marseille is now one of the most exciting footballers in Europe, drawing comparisons to the very best in the business. "Xavi is 31 years old, Samir is 23," Gilles Grimandi, Arsenal's chief scout in France, told BBC Sport. "If you compare Samir to Xavi when Xavi was 23, Samir is by far the better player. "This season he's been on the same level as the world's top players and, believe me, he will get a lot better in the coming years." High praise indeed, and Grimandi's words will be put to the test on Tuesday when Arsenal meet Barcelona in the second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie. It was Nasri who set up the winning goal in Arsenal's 2-1 first-leg victory, but outshining the likes of Xavi and Lionel Messi on their home turf is sure to prove an even tougher assignment. Not that the France international has ever been fazed by such tasks. "People don't realise how difficult it is to grow up as a footballer in Marseilles when you come from the city," Grimandi said of a player who joined his local club aged nine and made his debut at 17.
Kids like Nasri grow up playing in the streets of Marseilles and you can't really tackle on concrete, so it's all about technique. When you manage to nutmeg someone it's the ultimate satisfaction!
Nasri's former team-mate Boudewijn Zenden
"Everyone knew him by the time he was 12 or 13, so he had to deal with unbelievable expectation. After every game the fans would come up to him and analyse his performance. Big, big pressure. "He was only young but he always reacted incredibly well. He said "OK, I'm Nasri, I'd better go and do my job". And he must have done it well because look where he is today." The £12m spent to prise Nasri from Stade Velodrome in 2008 is looking increasingly like money well spent and Grimandi is not alone in tipping him for the PFA Player of the Year award. At the time of writing, the midfielder has scored 14 goals in 35 appearances, which is two more than he managed in his first two campaigns in north London combined. In 2008-09 and 09-10 he attempted a total of 36 shots in the Premier League and Champions League - this term he has already upped that figure to 47. "This is the gift of Arsene Wenger," explained former Arsenal defender Grimandi. "He convinces players they can always do better. He made Samir believe he could improve in every department. "Arsene has known him for many years, we watched him for a long time and we knew he would be a successful signing. But the most important thing for Samir was meeting Arsene. "It was Arsene who convinced him he had everything it takes to become the best player in the world." Whether or not Nasri goes on to reach that target remains to be seen but Wenger's assertion that a career at the top level does not properly begin until the age of 23 can only bode well. The explanations for his improvement are many and varied. Grimandi puts it down to the influence of Wenger while the manager himself points to Nasri's shock at missing out on France's 2010 World Cup squad, his greater physical strength, increased "efficiency" and a new-found conviction in front of goal. Opta analysis reveals a tactical switch, with Nasri now tending to occupy a more advanced position on either flank and cutting inside more regularly than before.
He is crossing the ball far less and completing a lower percentage of dribbles, which indicates he is trying harder to make runs off the ball and get on the end of moves rather than initiating them. This may, of course, reflect a desire from Wenger to leave playmaking duties to captain Cesc Fabregas and the increasingly important Jack Wilshere. Nasri would prefer to operate in an advanced central midfield role - as he did at Marseille - and he usually does so when Fabregas is out of the team (although interestingly not in the recent Carling Cup final defeat by Birmingham or Saturday's 0-0 draw with Sunderland). When Fabregas was out injured between 18 September to 19 October, Nasri scored five goals in five games. And when Fabregas missed the period between 23 November to 13 December, Nasri scored four in four. By contrast, he has only scored five goals in 20 games with Fabregas in the side. "Cesc is very important for Arsenal with his passing, his runs, his goals and his general influence," Boudewijn Zenden, a former team-mate of Nasri's at Marseilles, told BBC Sport. "If they're both on the pitch it can make it harder for one or the other to shine as much. Nasri was the key player at Marseille, whereas at Arsenal he maybe only gets to be when Cesc is out."
That said, Arsenal have fared much better this season with both men in the team - winning 70% of matches when they have played together compared to 59% when either one has been absent. The Gunners are sure to undergo another thorough examination at the Nou Camp, where they were beaten 4-1 in last year's quarter-finals to succumb 6-3 on aggregate. Zenden spent three years with the Catalan giants between 1998-2001, so speaks from experience when suggesting his old club will create a hostile atmosphere and come at Arsenal with unrelenting ferocity. "Because they're 2-1 down there will be a massive build-up in the press and in the stadium, with lots of singing and banners everywhere," stated the Dutchman, who now plays for Sunderland. "That will make Barca even more dangerous than normal. I know Arsenal have some players with pace to hit them on the counter-attack, but that's not the right way to go. "If you leave Barca to dictate the game they will attack you in wave after wave and eventually destroy you. You have to hold a high line, play your own game and try to pressurise them." However they approach it, Wenger's team are guaranteed a busy evening defensively and Michael Cox, editor of the football tactics website Zonal Marking, feels this is another area in which Nasri can have an impact. "It's not something people have particularly noticed but Nasri has developed his defensive game quite significantly this season," observed Cox. "In the first leg against Barca he was up against a world class attacking right-back in Dani Alves and kept him quiet almost the entire game. As soon as Wenger introduced Andrey Arshavin, Nasri moved to the right and suddenly Alves was constantly getting forward.
Nasri worked tirelessly to contain Dani Alves in the first leg
"If you look back to last season's visit of Chelsea to the Emirates, Nasri faced Ashley Cole and Cole beat him twice before crossing for goals. That isn't happening any more." Nasri, born in France to Algerian parents, grew up admiring fellow Marseilles natives Eric Cantona and Zinedine Zidane but his all-time hero was Diego Maradona and he "loves" the Barcelona style of football. Indeed, he seems the type of player who would fit perfectly into Pep Guardiola's squad, with his speed, skill, mobility and intelligence. "At Marseille you learn football the way it's still played on the streets," Zenden recalled. "They're very much into one-against-one situations where you try to make a fool out of your opponent. "Kids like Nasri grow up playing in the streets and you can't really tackle on concrete, so it's all about technique. When you manage to nutmeg someone it's the ultimate satisfaction! "Marseille have always had influences from north Africa; they've got this heated mentality which makes them want players to dribble past one or two opponents before passing the ball. They don't like simple football, they want something to look at and admire." Nasri came through the French youth system alongside the likes of Karim Benzema, Hatem Ben Arfa, Loic Remy and Jeremy Menez but Grimandi feels he had one particular quality that set him apart from his peers. "All five of them were born in 1987 and had immense talent," stated the 40-year-old. "When they played together for France at age group level it was near-impossible to say who was the best. "What separated Samir was his intelligence. I had never spoken to him before he signed but you could just smell his intelligence - and intelligence is a very important factor when we look at signing a player. "Samir is a student of football - he lives for the game. He loves training and watches game after game on TV. Name any player and he'll tell you about them. It's very rare to find players like Samir." This reinforces Grimandi's belief that Nasri is starting to warrant mention in the same breath as some of Barcelona's mesmeric stars. "All of these players - Fabregas, Nasri, Messi, Xavi, Andres Iniesta - are all very intelligent," he added. "Modern football is tight and if you don't think about what you're going to do with the ball before it arrives and if you don't have technical ability to do it, you won't survive. "These guys are small in stature and can work in a short space, they play at the right tempo, they go to the right places and they make the right decisions. "If you physically dominate the game, fair enough - but your limit will come. Physicality is not enough any more because nowadays every team is ready for the physical challenge." Nasri has come a long way - on Tuesday he will attempt to show just how far.

Northwich re-sign Gretna defender
Birch has not played for Gretna since September 2006
Northwich have re-signed Gretna defender Mark Birch - who had a two-year spell with the Vics between 1998 and 2000 - on a season-long loan.
The 29-year-old, who can play at full-back or in central defence, has not made a first-team appearance for Gretna since September 2006.
Birch spent the second half of last season on loan at Northwich's Conference rivals Southport.
He left Northwich for Carlisle in 2000, before joining Gretna in 2003.

FA Cup win secures Arsenal Double
By David Ornstein
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
Faye White's Arsenal proved too strong
Three goals in six minutes saw Arsenal thrash Leeds 4-1 to win the FA Cup and secure a domestic Double.
The Gunners were frustrated in the opening 45 minutes but after the break the league champions took control. Kelly Smith's hooked effort, Jayne Ludlow's neat finish and a deflected Lianne Sanderson shot put Arsenal on course for victory in Nottingham. Jessica Clarke headed Leeds back into the game but Smith tapped a late fourth to secure a record ninth Cup triumph.
The result at the City Ground maintains Arsenal's 100% record in FA Cup finals and they have now won 29 major trophies in 16 years. Having just sealed their fifth successive Premier League title, they came into the game as overwhelming favourites. Arsenal beat Leeds 4-0 in March and 5-0 in the 2006 FA Cup final, and have suffered only one defeat in more than two years of domestic football. And the gulf in class was evident from the outset as Rick Passmoor's side soaked up waves of pressure. Arsenal spent lengthy periods of the first half encamped in their opponents' territory but they met stubborn resistance in the form of goalkeeper Carly Telford. 606: DEBATE

Alex Scott had already seen a scuffed effort cleared off the line before Smith saw her sixth-minute snap shot repelled by England's third-choice goalkeeper. Two minutes later the 20-year-old expertly tipped Karen Carney's thunderous drive onto the cross-bar. Telford palmed away Sanderson's close-range shot and then athletically tipped Ludlow's 25-yard effort over for a corner. Arsenal, who won the quadruple last season, continued to carve out a plethora of clear openings but a combination of their own profligacy and Telford's acrobatics kept them at bay. Telford produced a wonderful double save to deny Scott before Arsenal and England captain Faye White wasted a glorious chance when she headed Carney's cross high and wide from eight yards. Leeds did have the ball in the net before half-time but Amanda Barr's lob was ruled out for off-side and Arsenal goalkeeper Emma Byrne was forced to claw Sue Smith's corner off the line. But Arsenal finished the half by regaining control and carried their momentum into the second period. In the 54th minute Rachel Yankey eased through midfield and slid a pass to Smith, who cleverly turned the ball beyond Telford. Leeds were visibly tiring and four minutes later Ludlow ghosted in behind their back four to divert Sanderson's free-kick through Telford's legs. And on the hour mark Sanderson continued her prolific goalscoring form by netting for the 51st time in all competitions, albeit with the help of a deflection. Leeds were in no mood to be embarrassed and, when a long-range strike from skipper Smith rebounded off the bar, Clarke headed home to give the underdogs hope. But their quest for a second allowed Arsenal to exploit gaping holes and, while they continued to squander one opportunities, Smith's second ensured the Cup would remain in north London.
Arsenal goalscorer Kelly Smith:"We were glad the goal came early in the second half and then we could control the tempo of the game.
"We were a little bit frustrated in the first half, we had so many chances to put the game to bed but we didn't although we managed to get the goal in the end.
"Leeds goalkeeper Carly Telford was player of the match for me. She is a great up-and-coming player, very agile and she is soon to be England's number one I am sure."
Arsenal skipper Faye White:"It's a great feeling, it was an amazing occasion. We are really pleased.
"In the first half we kept knocking but some of the shots were wayward and Carly made a few good saves to keep them in it.
"We said at half-time if we can keep the pressure going the floodgates would open but Leeds scored as well."
Leeds skipper Sue Smith:"We are disappointed. We came out here to play and we defended quite well but as soon as they scored one the floodgates opened.
"The best team won on the day but we battled and fair play to the girls, they worked so hard.
"It's a great experience for the youngsters to come to a stage like this and perform. It's a big stage and they will learn from it and fingers crossed we will be back next year."

BBC Sport at The Crucible
O'Sullivan defiant over gesture
Ronnie O'Sullivan secured his place in the second round with a relatively easy 10-6 win over Stephen Maguire - but the young Scot's play won many admirers.
O'Sullivan ended day one on top but when Maguire won the opening frame of the second day with his second century break, it was clear he meant business.
The former world champion soon restored, then extended, his lead and the outcome seemed to be a formality.
But he conceded the 15th frame at 6-37 before winning the next to advance. O'Sullivan admitted he had been impressed by the Scot. "He's a great player and I think he's got the game to win the title. Snooker is in great shape with the likes of him and Ryan Day coming through," he said. "Whether or not I won, it was enjoyable to be involved in a game with someone who wanted to match you shot for shot. "The game's lucky to have players like him coming through." I think I can win it in a few years
Stephen Maguire
Maguire, at 23 the youngest player in the tournament, could hardly have been given a tougher start than facing O'Sullivan, but the 2000 champion began in faltering fashion.
And when Maguire put together a 121 clearance to take a 3-2 lead, it looked like another seed could be about to fall at the first.
But he wasted a great chance to go 4-2 up and O'Sullivan did not need asking twice, making breaks of 66 and 109 on his way to a 6-3 overnight lead.
Maguire began the second session confidently, with a second century break, but a 73 break by O'Sullivan in the next restored his lead, and he won a battle of wits to take a nervous 12th frame and go 8-4 up. The Glaswegian came close to a third century break near the end, before O'Sullivan finally secured his expected victory.
Maguire was upbeat about his performance, saying: "If someone had said to me this year I'd win my first ranking event, get to the Crucible and play Ronnie there, I'd have bitten their hand off. "At the end when he shook my hand, he said 'You'll win this one day'. I said 'I know'. "I didn't know what to expect before I came down, but it's a great arena. I think I can win it in a few years." First round result (best of 19 frames): R O'Sullivan (Eng) 10-6 S Maguire (Sco) 19-110 (60), 67-34 (67), 52-58, 105-16 (69), 0-142 (121), 74-61, 73-1 (66), 109-26 (109), 73-34, 17-112 (112), 73-68 (73), 61-33, 70-59 (59 Maguire), 0-111 (77), 6-37, 70-33 E-mail this to a friend
