Apartheid government sought germs to kill blacks
Journalists listen to the chemical weapons expert's testimony
A South African scientist has told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that the apartheid government considered trying to develop a bacteria which would kill only blacks. The former head of a military research laboratory, Daan Goosen, told the commission that the project had the backing of South Africa's then Surgeon General, who described it as "the most important project in the country."
Although the substance was never developed, Mr Goosen said that an unknown European scientist claimed to have developed a strain of bacteria in the early 1980s "capable of killing pigmented people".
"It could have been used as a negotiation back-up," Mr Goosen told the Commission. "A thing like this could have been used to maintain peace. It was a case of being the strongest."
Plans to travel to Europe for a meeting were abandoned because of fears that it could be a trap, but the witness said South African scientists continued their own work on the project, and also looked into methods of making blacks selectively infertile.
Wouter Basson discussed killing MandelaGoosen also said he and his immediate supervisor, Wouter Basson, had discussed the possibility of killing Nelson Madela and Oliver Tambo - then President of the ANC - through the use of carcinogens, as well as arranging the supply of snake venom "to eliminate an enemy of the state."
In other testimony, the former head of the police forensics laboratory, General Lothar Neethling, told the Commission that he had been instructed to supply Basson with confiscated supplies of narcotic drugs such as marijuana, LSD and Mandrax.
The intention, he said, was to extract the active ingredients for insertion into crowd-control grenades.
On Wednesday it was alleged that officials plotted to mentally disable Nelson Mandela with poison during the final years of his imprisonment
Mr Goosen told the commission he now realised that he was wrong to work on the projects, but said he had not been thinking rationally at the time.
"It was a time of conflict" he said. "Communism was coming. It was
total onslaught."

Cowell defends Idol 'mean' streak
American Idol producers and judges faced the press on Saturday
American Idol judges and producers have hit back at criticism that the new series of the talent show is too mean.
More than 37 million people tuned in to see the sixth series start on Tuesday - a record for the show. But some critics have said it is more cruel than ever.
Judge Simon Cowell told one hopeful he looked like "one of those creatures that live in the jungle with those massive eyes... Bush babies?"
Cowell told reporters: "If you don't want to hear that, don't show up."
Cowell is known for his blunt put-downs on American Idol, America's Got Talent and the UK's X Factor. He said the "bush baby" comment was an "off-the-cuff remark".
It's more the bad singers that will bring in the ratings
Ken WarwickExecutive producer
"If he's offended, then I apologise," he said. "I might never call anyone a bush baby again."
Executive Producer Ken Warwick said viewers liked to see the worst singers. "It's more the bad singers that will bring in the ratings," he said.
And Peter Liguori, entertainment president of TV network Fox, said: "Let's face it, the show has been on the air six years, the judges have been critical for six years."
Cowell also called one tall contestant a "giraffe" and asked an overweight singer if he "borrowed Randy's pants", referring to fellow judge Randy Jackson.
'Outright cruelty'
"It just seems like they're being a lot meaner," said another unsuccessful contestant Jessica Rhode, who fell to her knees and wept before the judges.
The new series has also come in for criticism from talk show host Rosie O'Donnell, who said the judges should not "make fun of someone's physical appearance and then when they leave the room laugh hysterically".
Entertainment Weekly critic Michael Slezak wrote: "The American Idol auditions in Seattle sometimes crossed the line into outright cruelty."
And the San Francisco Chronicle's David Wiegand said: "The judges are either seriously off their game, or have just gotten tired of themselves." Much of the show was "uncomfortably sad", he wrote.

Search on for Moon landing film
Nasa recorded higher-quality footage than that seen by the public
A search has begun to locate the original film footage of man's first steps on the Moon.
The footage of the Apollo 11 crew's landing on the Moon is one of 20th Century's most important artefacts.
The tapes are believed to be stored somewhere in the archive at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland.
But as many of those involved in the archiving of the original tapes moved on, retired or passed away their location has been lost.
The footage seen by people around the world has been compared to a photocopy of a photocopy, according to the Daily Telegraph newspaper.
It came from a camera that had been pointed at a black-and-white monitor. The astronauts actually beamed higher-quality footage back to Earth -seen by a small number of people at three tracking stations.
But this had already been stripped of much of its detail. To make sure the transmission would make it back to Earth, the images sent back by the astronauts were recorded at 10 frames per second (fps), and had to be converted to 60fps in order to be broadcast. In the process, much of the detail was lost.
Eighty-one-year-old Stan Lebar was in charge of the images from Apollo 11. He said what he saw was so blurred he initially thought something had gone wrong.
"We thought there had been a problem getting the converter to work properly," he said.
"What was broadcast to the world was nowhere near as good as what was received," said John Sarkissian, of the CSIRO Parkes Observatory in Australia, one of the three tracking stations that taped the original footage before sending it on to Houston in converted form.
Although these tapes did not match the standard of normal TV transmissions, they would still be better than the video we have today, especially if processed using digital technology. A coalition of scientists and Nasa veterans - including Mr Lebar and Mr Sarkissian - is now hunting through Nasa's archives.
The tapes appear to have been sent to the US National Archives, before being returned to Nasa, which stored them at its Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
"I just think this is what happens when you have a large government bureaucracy that functions for decade after decade," said Keith Cowing, editor of the website Nasa Watch.
"It's not malicious or intentional, but I think it's unfortunate that Nasa doesn't have maybe just one more person whose job it is to look back at its history."
A Nasa spokesman said: "We're trying to track them down through the paperwork created at the time - but it's 35 years ago, so it's a challenge." E-mail this to a friend

Appeal flushes out urinal thief
Landlord Alan Dreja has been reunited with the stolen urinal
A shamefaced thief caught on CCTV as he walked out of a Hampshire pub with a urinal in his rucksack has handed himself in.
The 42-year-old man, who has not been named, handed himself in to police in Salisbury on Monday evening.
The man, from Salisbury, Wilts, told police he had taken it from the Royal Oak pub in Southampton as a "souvenir".
After being reunited with the urinal, delighted landlord Alan Dreja said he may put it on display in the pub.
"Three policemen returned it," said Mr Dreja. "The publicity which surrounded the theft seems to have flushed him out."
The tale of the stolen loo has been reported as far afield as Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Thailand. The space left behind when the thief expertly unplumbed his prize has already been filled, so now the landlord has a dilemma. "I don't know whether to put it on display in the bar, or put it on eBay", he said.
The thief has been given a caution.

GB women keep hockey hopes alive
Cannot play media. Sorry, this media is not available in your territory.
Video - GB women earn Argentina draw
Great Britain's women kept alive their medal hopes after fighting back to earn a 2-2 draw with Argentina.
Argentina took an early lead in the hockey when Agustina Garcia hit home from an acute angle before Alejandra Gulla made it 2-0 with a lifted shot.
But Britain scored twice inside five minutes to get themselves back on terms in the second half in Beijing.
Sarah Thomas popped the ball beyond the Argentine keeper before Mel Clewlow smashed in the equaliser.
After a 5-1 hammering by defending champions German in their first Group A match, Britain needed a result against Argentina.
MY SPORT: DEBATE
In the hockey, if anyone "saved the day", it was Beth Storry. Some wonderful saves from her to keep the team in the game
RidRed
But Danny Kerry's team looked out of sorts as an attacking Argentine side left the British defence bamboozled as they opened up a 2-0 lead.
Britain picked up the pace in the second half at the Olympic Green Hockey Stadium and after a series of instinctive saves Thomas finally made the breakthrough.
Clewlow levelled the match in the 51st minute but Argentina were only kept at bay by some solid keeping from Beth Storry.
Argentina missed a chance to claim a late victory but Rosario Lucjetti failed to get on the end of a pass to set up a clear goal-scoring opportunity to the relief of the British side.
Great Britain now face a make-or-break match against New Zealand on Thursday before final matches against Japan and the US.
Kerry said: "We had played pretty well and Argentina had been very good at their penalty corners.
"We tidied up one thing and it was really talking about the next score and generating momentum."
