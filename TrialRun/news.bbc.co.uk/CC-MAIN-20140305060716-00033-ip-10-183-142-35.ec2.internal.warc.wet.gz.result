Cuba marks 50 years of revolution
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
The festivities were filled with nostalgia and praise for Fidel Castro
Cuba has marked the 50th anniversary of the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, creating a communist state on the United States' doorstep.
President Raul Castro, who took over from Fidel last year, spoke from below the same balcony where his brother declared victory on 1 January 1959.
He predicted the revolution would survive another 50 years.
The festivities have been muted as Cuba struggles with big economic challenges and the aftermath of three hurricanes.
Reacting to the anniversary, a White House spokesman said the US continued to seek freedom for the Cuban people.
Series of concerts
Addressing the nation from the south-eastern city of Santiago de Cuba, Raul Castro said the next 50 years "will also be of permanent struggle".

"With the firm promise that in this land we can always exclaim with pride that glory to our heroes and martyrs. Long live Fidel, long live the revolution, long live free Cuba!" said President Castro.
He was speaking from the very place where his elder brother proclaimed victory after the US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista had fled the country 50 years ago.
He spoke proudly of the 1959 revolution that transformed the Caribbean island into a communist state 145 km (90 miles) from US shores, but warned the country should remain vigilant.
"The enemy will never cease to be aggressive, treacherous and dominant," he said.
"It is time to reflect on the future, on the next 50 years when we shall continue to struggle incessantly.
"I'm not trying to scare anyone, this is the truth," he added.
A series of free concerts had been planned across the island, but the authorities said it was not the time for lavish celebrations after the nation suffered one of the most difficult financial years since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Towering presence
The frail health of Fidel Castro has also dampened the mood of anniversary celebrations, says the BBC's Michael Voss in Havana.
CUBAN REVOLUTION MAPPED
Follow the rebels' progressCuba timeline
The 82-year-old has not been seen in public since undergoing major surgery almost 18 months ago. There was no pre-recorded message on state television on New Year's Eve nor one of his regular newspaper editorials to mark the event.
Nonetheless, he remains a towering presence in Cuba, even in the background.
Raul Castro has introduced some limited reforms since he has been in charge, but many Cubans believe that as long as Fidel is alive, no meaningful political or economic change will happen, correspondents say.
Fifty years on, the legacy of the revolution is complex. There is free education and health care but the state-controlled economy means wages for many Cubans are very low, on average about $20 to $25 a month.
Tight restrictions
The country's difficulties cannot just be blamed on the US trade embargo, in place since 1962, or global financial problems, says our correspondent.
There is enormous pressure and expectation amongst Cubans for change, he adds.
Over the decades since the revolution, political opposition has been crushed and hundreds of thousands of Cubans have gone into exile.
"The Castro brothers have not treated their people particularly well," said White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe on the eve of the anniversary.
"Many political dissidents are in jail. The economy is suffering and not free. And the United States will continue to try to seek the freedom of the people of Cuba, and support them."
During his time in office, President George W Bush imposed tight restrictions on Cuban-Americans visiting the island and the amount of money they could send.
However, US policy towards Cuba appears set to change.
President-elect Barack Obama, who takes office on 20 January, has said he will maintain the Cuban embargo but that some restrictions could be eased.
Attitudes among Cuban-Americans may also be changing. A recent poll suggested that for the first time a majority of those living in Miami, the centre of anti-Castro sentiment, favoured ending the embargo.

US author is UK library favourite
James Patterson used to work as an advertising executive
US thriller writer James Patterson has become the UK's most borrowed author, with his books taken out of libraries 1.5 million times in 12 months.
He has overtaken children's writer Dame Jacqueline Wilson, whose books have dominated for the past four years.
Patterson is best known for his crime thrillers featuring detective Alex Cross. His website states he has sold more than 130m books worldwide.
The list, compiled by Public Lending Right, covered the year to June 2007.
THE JAMES PATTERSON FILE
He worked as a New York advertising executive for Burger King His first book was published in 1976 Now uses a team of co-writers to publish eight novels a year Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls became movies starring Morgan Freeman
Maximum Ride is his series of novels for younger readers
Even though Patterson is the most popular author, the most popular book is At Risk by another American thriller writer, Patricia Cornwell.
Overall, there has been a decline in the number of books borrowed. But children's fiction is popular, with five of the top 10 authors writing for the under-15s. JK Rowling's Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was the most borrowed children's book. The Meaning of the 21st Century by Dr James Martin, which deals with global warming and the future of humanity, topped the non-fiction list.

Scores die in Madrid bomb carnage
The blasts hit during the morning rush hour Powerful explosions have torn through three Madrid train stations during the morning rush hour, with latest reports speaking of 173 people killed. Near simultaneous blasts hit Atocha station in the centre of the Spanish capital and two smaller stations. No group has admitted responsibility but Spain's government blames Basque separatist group Eta for the attacks which come ahead of Sunday's election.
"There is no doubt Eta is responsible," said Spain's interior minister. 'Criminal killers'
"Eta had been looking for a massacre in Spain," the minister, Angel Acebes, said after an emergency cabinet meeting.

Commuters describe chaos
Who is to blame?
"Unfortunately, today it achieved its goal," he told a news conference, saying the security services were certain Eta was behind the blasts.
There was no warning ahead of the attacks. In total there were 10 blasts, Mr Acebes said, and police had defused three other devices hidden in backpacks. The three explosions at Atocha happened at about 0630 GMT , destroying a train that was pulling into the station. There were also four blasts in a street outside.
"People started to scream and run, some bumping into each other," Juani Fernandez, a civil servant who was on the platform, told the Associated Press. Where the blasts happened
"I saw people with blood pouring from them, people on the ground." A 28-year-old man called Mariano, who was travelling on the train, told El Pais newspaper that the carriage behind his had been thrown up in the air.
As people scrambled out, he tried to help the injured. "I held a girl as she died in my arms," he told the newspaper. Atocha is a huge rail station used by commuter and inter-city trains, which also has a metro station. There were similar scenes of destruction and chaos at two smaller commuter stations: El Pozo and Santa Eugenia. HAVE YOUR SAY
There was a very big blast in the trains and everything that happened after that has been very confused

From the initial confusion, the scale of death and destruction has become ever more apparent. The authorities say that, so far, 173 people are known to have died. At least 600 people have been injured and Madrid's hospitals, swamped with casualties, have made an urgent appeal for blood donations. Mourning
Spain's political parties suspended campaigning for Sunday's poll.
The BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus says that, in the absence of an Eta claim of responsibility, there will inevitably be continuing speculation about other potential perpetrators. Emergency numbers for worried relatives

(00 34) 915 767 000
Spain's strong support for the US and Britain in the run-up to war with Iraq could make Spain a target in the eyes of shadowy Islamic groups, he says. Such a suggestion has already been made by the leader of the banned Basque separatist party Batasuna, who denied that Eta could have been behind the attacks. Arnald Otegi pointed the finger instead at what he called "the Arab resistance". Mr Acebes, speaking earlier from the scene of the blast at Atocha, said, "Have no doubt, those responsible will be caught and will pay for their crime."
The Basque regional president, Juan Jose Ibarretxe, stressed that Eta does not represent the Basque people. "When Eta attacks, the Basque heart breaks into a thousand pieces," he said.
The Spanish government has declared three days of mourning for the victims and called on Spaniards to stage rallies on Friday evening to condemn the attacks. Bomb plots
If it is confirmed as Eta's work, it would be their deadliest attack in more than three decades of armed struggle for independence. MAIN ETA ATTACKS
July 2003: Bomb attacks in Alicante and Benidorm, 13 injured. Further explosion at Santander airport days later
Jan, Feb 2000: Car bombs explode in Madrid and the Basque capital Vitoria
June 1998: Car bomb kills Popular Party councillor Manuel Zamarreno
July 1997: ETA kidnaps and kills Basque councillor Miguel Angel Blanco
June 1987: 21 shoppers are killed in an attack on a Barcelona supermarket
1980: In ETA's bloodiest year, 118 people are killed
Dec 1973: Assassination of Prime Minister Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco
ETA: Key events
Last month, two Basques suspected of being Eta members were arrested as they headed to Madrid in a truck laden with explosives. Spanish police said they were arrested about 140km outside the city with 500kg of explosives hidden in the vehicle. And last December, Spanish authorities said they foiled a Basque separatist plot to blow up a train at a Madrid rail station. France has stepped up its police presence on its border with Spain in response to Thursday's attacks, the French news agency AFP reports.
Close co-operation between the two countries has led to dozens of arrests of suspected Eta members in southern France in recent years. 1. Atocha station, 0639 GMT: Four bombs explode on a train entering the station, 59 people killed. Three blasts on a train inside the station, 30 people killed
2. El Pozo station, 0641 GMT: Two explosions, 67 people killed
3. Santa Eugenia station, 0642 GMT: One explosion, 17 people killed

My life in Saudi: Hasna
Eight young Saudi women discuss their lives and how they hope to progress in the next 10 years.
Lama:22, student
"I want to be a role model to show we Saudi women are like other women"
Rotana:21, student
"Saudi girls are very ambitious and very smart... they want to be heard"
Abla:22, student
"Saudi women want to prove that it's not only men who are capable"
Rosana21, student
"I see myself as a happy mother and wife, that's the most important thing"
Baiyanne:17, student
"No matter how much I study, I'm always just me, doing what I want"
Hasna:27, translator
"I see myself having my own publishing house that serves religion"
Asma:21, housewife
"I'm trying to achieve a balance between home, husband, pregnancy and study"
Hasna
I would like to describe four paths in my life.
The first one has to do with my career. When I first applied to work at the college here, I never chose to be a translator but they needed one so I accepted it.
I always love a challenge and I am so grateful for that opportunity.
On this basis, I have applied to a Scottish university, a distance learning course. It's in translation and inter-culture communication in Edinburgh. I am still waiting for the acceptance, but hopefully I will be able to get it and pursue my studies.
I see myself in the future having my own translation or publishing house which serves a religious purpose and helps explain and clarify lots of misunderstandings around the world about religion.
I would like the chance to study more languages so I can work all over the world, translate books, programmes, anything that would serve my religion, Islam, and that would help other people to understand and to read it perfectly.
The second path that I have is my baby boy. His name is Amar. He's a very intelligent kid. He's very hyperactive like his mother. I get to see him during breaks and holidays, because he lives with his father in Riyadh. I think we're very attached, although we live apart.
Hasna feels her skills could help those in need in Saudi
We're both growing older. As he gets stronger, I get weaker. He is the centre and the core of my life, and I hope somewhere in his heart, I could be as well.
The third path, I've chosen to picture in my project is my personal life and social life. In my home I've chosen all the furniture painted all the walls, drilled all the shelves and did all the work.
The fourth and the last path that I have chosen to create is helping or volunteering or learning to help either disabled people, orphans or people in need. I can help them with the skills or qualifications that I have. Return to the top
The following comments reflect the balance of views received:
This debate is now closed. Thank you for your comments.
I think you have a brilliant vision for your future. Although there are many hurdles in life, I think any ambitious person will face these hurdles with patience. I think you are one of those ambitious persons. You are a good example of a human being. May the future will be better and better. Shawki , Doha, Qatar It's good to learn that despite the many hurdles that you face, you remain determined to pursue your endeavours. Your intent to establish a translation base to serve the religious purpose is very wise and accurate. As an English teacher myself, I realise the importance of such projects, particularly when a lot of Islam's noble teachings have been either misunderstood or distorted lately. Carry on with your desired goal and no matter what you do, do not compromise your religious principles.Muhammad Hasan, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia There is long a history of feminism in the Arab world. Women have been fighting there like other countries, other sisters against the patriarchal power structure. I salute Hasna and other Saudi women for their great struggle.Rabi Rafique, Rajshahi, Bangladesh To Idris, Everyone who goes through school education gets the chance to learn the English language in Saudi Arabia, which I find to be very important if we are to learn from other countries' experiences. Reading is not popular among Saudis, but this is changing rapidly. More and more people are reading now and I can feel this change around me. Recently, a lot of books have been translated into Arabic not far away from their publishing dates. Overall, reading is increasing in general in the Arab world, but we are still not close to some of the other countries.Amin Jaber, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia Muslim women are not any different form the rest of the world except when it comes to how the media portrays them. May Allah help all these Saudi women in their goals.KM Sheikh, Atlanta, Ga, USA
It is nice to hear that someone like her is using her skills to enrich peoples lives. Keep going, you will make it into the school. I am also a multilingual translator. James H, Portland Oregon I am quite impressed by Hasna's wisdom. It is true that religion needs to be taught to the layman so that all the fallacies which bound his life can be put to rest. They were, after all, born out of the teachings of religion, and not of any religion per se. Our lives are guided by the principles that are enshrined in the religion that we believe in. If that belief itself is distorted, followers of that religion will never progress in their lives. Their decision will never be informed decisions because they were taken in the darkness of ignorance and not in the light of knowledge and wisdom. Hasna, in pursuing this activity of translating Islam, has truly taken a wise step. I wish her all the very best and pray that the Good Lord guide her through her endeavours.Santosh Nair, Bombay, India I am curious about how you came to learn English. Do you many Saudis, men and women, have the opportunity and desire to learn English? It is reported that there is very little reading in the Arab world including newspapers, books, magazines, etc. Do you find that to be the case? Do people read much in Arabic and or in other languages? Are you able to read many books that have been translated into Arabic or is it easier to find English books?Idris, Chicago, IL

Rail lines that connected communities
By Lila Allen
BBC News
Dr Richard Beeching's report led to the closure of a third of railway networks
The Beeching cuts of the 1960s saw a third of railway networks closed. Today, the Association of Train Operating Companies (Atoc) has proposed some of these lines should be reopened.But what of the communities living on them? Then, as now, it is the people in the area who will feel the direct impact. Brixham in Devon is one of the lines suggested for reopening. In its heyday, the line ran from Paignton to Brixham via Churston. Today, the line from Churston is the site of new homes and roads. But in the 1960s, the impact of the Beeching cuts was felt dearly by a community reliant on the fishing industry. "Utter dismay"Torbay Councillor Mike Morey was still at school when the line was closed. His grandfather was a porter at Brixham station. My sister had her hat thrown out of the window by one of the boys one year, I think it was Christmas time

Operators call for new rail lines
Cllr Morey remembers that the town felt "utter dismay" at the closure. "It was a popular line," he said, known as the "six-penny train" taking the town's people to the main shopping centre in Torquay. But passengers were not the only ones who relied on the service. The town depended economically on the trains to import coal and export fish, the main industry of the area. The trains carried fish directly to Billingsgate market in London, boosting the local economy - which until the railway line opened only served the local area of Torquay. HostilityIn the Surrey town of Cranleigh, passengers were the main victims of the service closure. By the time it closed in 1965, it was a main commuter line, taking people to London and also on holiday to the coast. The decision to close the service was met with hostility by the local community. Proposed rail expansion could see disused tracks back in operation
Michael Miller, chairman of the Cranleigh history society, says the locals were upset. "Their link to London had gone. It was a friendly, local service and in those days not everyone had a car," he said. Since then, Cranleigh's population has increased with people moving from nearby Guildford. Mr Miller welcomes the proposal to reopen the railway line, but says some people have extended their gardens over where the trains used to run and so won't be happy to see it back. Fond memoriesBut Brian Cheesman is keen to see it return. Having served for 33 years on the local council he is now vice chairman and has fond memories the railway line which he used to get to school. The journey took just 12 minutes as opposed to 25 minutes on the bus. "We had some genuine fun," he remembers. "My sister had her hat thrown out of the window by one of the boys one year, I think it was Christmas time." Brixham in Devon relied on the export of fish to Torquay and London
When British troops came through Cranleigh during World War II, an enthusiastic signalman changed the points too soon resulting in half the train shunting forward and the other back, straddling the station at Cranleigh. "That was a hoot," Mr Cheesman said. But his are mixed memories. Two people were killed on the train after it was struck by German bombs. Mr Cheesman believes they were sisters. The closure of the line in the late 1960s hit the area's economy hard. Two coal merchants soon went out of business after the line was shut. The business was no longer financially viable after the merchants had to travel to Horsham or Guildford for coal. Welcome developmentThe Atoc proposals could see the line to Wisbech in Cambridgeshire back in service. Cllr Alan Melton remembers the railway line well. "In the good old days, I like a lot of people travelled by train from March to the Isle of Ely college in Wisbech. It closed during my time," he said. He remembers how unhappy people were, drawing up petitions before having to use buses and later cars to make the journey. Ever since the closure, there has been a campaign to reopen the line. Cllr Melton called today's news a "welcome development" which could help ease congestion in a town that has boomed since the 1960s when Dr Richard Beeching proposed his cuts.

Call for safety at street party
A fireworks display in Edinburgh is held to bring in the New Year
New Year revellers are being urged to be "safe, sensible, warm and happy" as final preparations for Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations get under way.
About 100,000 people are expected to bring in the bells in the city centre, which will see pop icons the Pet Shop Boys joining the New Year's Eve party.
People have been urged to wrap up warm and drink sensibly at the event.
Organisers said they were confident the party would go ahead despite severe weather warnings.
It is the first time that people attending Edinburgh's Hogmanay will be able to buy alcohol on Princes Street.
However, drinkers under the influence of excessive alcohol may be refused entry to the street party and organisers are urging people not to bring glass into the arenas.
Councillor Brian Fallon, of Edinburgh Council, led the calls for party-goers to keep safe.
He said: "We want to ensure that Edinburgh continues to host the best and safest New Year celebrations in the world.
Tom Halpin, deputy Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders Police, warned that people could be searched as they go into the street party.

48 horas fren�ticas
Redacci�n BBC Mundo
La crisis entre los gobiernos de Colombia, Ecuador y Venezuela se desat� en menos de 48 horas.
Empez� el s�bado en la ma�ana con el anunci� de la muerte de Ra�l Reyes por parte del ministro de Defensa de Colombia y tuvo uno de sus hitos el domingo en la noche con el anuncio la expulsi�n del embajador de Colombia en Ecuador.
La siguiente es una cronolog�a de los hechos tal y como han transcurrido hasta ahora
S�bado 1 de marzo
El ministro de Defensa de Colombia fue quien anunci� la muerte de Ra�l Reyes.
El gobierno de Colombia da a conocer que Ra�l Reyes, considerado uno de los comandantes m�s importantes de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC, muri� en un enfrentamiento con el ej�rcito colombiano en la madrugada del s�bado.
Juan Manuel Santos, ministro de Defensa, declara que "por fuentes humanas e informaci�n verificada por la inteligencia del Estado, el gobierno colombiano se enter� que guerrilleros del Frente 48 de las FARC se encontraban cerca de la frontera con Ecuador, en un lugar denominado Granada, y que en la noche del 29 de febrero, el miembro del Secretariado, alias Ra�l Reyes, har�a presencia en ese punto". "Se prepar� una operaci�n para atacar el lugar (...) en el sitio que hab�a se�alado la fuente, operaci�n que se inici� en la madrugada de hoy, exactamente, a las 00:25 (hora local) con un bombardeo por parte de la Fuerza A�rea Colombiana".
El presidente colombiano, �lvaro Uribe, llam� personalmente al mandatario ecuatoriano, Rafael Correa, entre las 08:00 y las 08:35 del s�bado para informarle de la incursi�n.
En im�genes transmitidas por la cadena de televisi�n CNN, se pudo ver cuando el presidente Correa fue interrumpido "de urgencia", durante la grabaci�n de un programa de televisi�n, por una llamada telef�nica de Uribe.
A su regreso de la conversaci�n, Correa dijo que Uribe le hab�a comunicado que "los combatientes incursionaron en territorio ecuatoriano y la balacera se dio en territorio ecuatoriano". El ministro de Defensa colombiano infoma que la muerte de Ra�l Reyes se produjo en territorio ecuatoriano. Santos dice que Fuerzas Militares colombianas fueron atacadas desde territorio ecuatoriano y que sin violar el espacio a�reo de ese pa�s se realiz� un bombardeo en el que muri� Reyes.
Hugo Cha�vez fue el primero en criticar a Colombia por la incursi�n en Ecuador.
El presidente de Venezuela, Hugo Ch�vez, dice que el Gobierno de Colombia viol� el territorio de Ecuador con el ataque y advirti� que una acci�n similar en su pa�s llevar�a a la guerra.
"Presidente Uribe, pi�nselo bien, no se le vaya a ocurrir hacer eso por aqu� (...) porque ser�a algo sumamente grave y ser�a causus belis: causa de guerra, una incursi�n militar en Venezuela", declar� Hugo Ch�vez.
Poco despu�s, Alvaro Uribe asume toda la responsabilidad por la muerte en territorio ecuatoriano de Ra�l Reyes.
El mandatario agradeci� adem�s al presidente de Ecuador, Rafael Correa, y a las personas que aportaron la informaci�n para el �xito de la operaci�n militar.
En la noche, en rueda de prensa, el presidente de Ecuador anuncia que ha convocado a su embajador en Colombia para consultas y asegura que la incursi�n de las fuerzas armadas colombianas en territorio colombiano son una flagrante violaci�n al Derecho Internacional Humanitario.
Correa dijo que el presidente de Colombia o estaba mal informado o le minti� abiertamente al informarle de la operaci�n y que considera �sa la "peor agresi�n que ha sufrido Ecuador por parte de Colombia".
Correa agreg� que en el ataque se hab�a usado avanzada tecnolog�a y que los rebeldes murieron mientras dorm�an, pues estaban en piyama. Por �sto calific� el hecho de una "masacre".
Domingo 2 de marzo
�lvaro Uribe asumi� la responsabilidad por lo ocurrido en Ecuador.
En un comunicado, el ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Colombia niega que haya violado la soberan�a de Ecuador y asegura que actu� en leg�tima defensa
"Los terroristas, entre ellos Ra�l Reyes, han tenido la costumbre de asesinar en Colombia e invadir el territorio de los pa�ses vecinos para refugiarse. Muchas veces Colombia ha padecido estas situaciones que estamos obligados a evitar en defensa de nuestros ciudadanos".
Hugo Ch�vez ordena el env�o de batallones blindados a la frontera con Colombia. Adem�s, cierra la embajada venezolana en Bogot� y el retiro de todo el personal diplom�tico.
Ch�vez se�ala a Uribe de ser un "criminal, paramilitar, narcotraficante y lacayo del imperio". Tambi�n lo acusa de mentir sobre lo que consider� el "asesinato cobarde" de "Reyes", a quien rinde un minuto de silencio
Todos estos anuncios los hace en su programa semanal, "Al�, Presidente"
Poco despu�s Ecuador, insatisfecho por respuesta de Colombia, anuncia la inmediata retirada de su embajador en Bogot�, Francisco Su�scum, previamente llamado a consultas. Tambi�n declara en alerta a sus fuerzas armadas.
Ecuador dijo que tres guerrilleras sobrevivieron el ataque.
En Ecuador se informa que militares de ese pa�s, que visitaron la zona donde muri� Reyes, encontraron a tres guerrilleras heridas, las cuales fueron llevadas a centros asistenciales.
En una alocuci�n por televisi�n, el mandatario ecuatoriano anuncia la expulsi�n del embajador colombiano en Quito, Carlos Holguin, y el env�o de tropas a la frontera con Colombia.
Tambi�n pide una reuni�n de emergencia de la Organizaci�n de Estados Americanos (OEA) y de la Comunidad Andina de Naciones, (CAN).
Un portavoz de la presidencia de Colombia le dice a varios periodistas que documentos hallados en el computador de Ra�l Reyes muestran v�nculo entre el gobierno de Rafael Correa y las FARC.
El director d ela polic�a de Colombia anunci� el hallazgo en el computador de Reyes.
En rueda de prensa, el director de la polic�a de Colombia, Oscar Naranjo, revel� que en los computadores del comandante guerrillero se encontraron documentos, como correos electr�nicos y actas, en los que se deja constancia de una entrevista de Reyes con el ministro de seguridad p�blica de Ecuador, Gustavo Larrea.
El general Naranjo dijo que la informaci�n hallada es "muy grave" y "afecta la seguridad nacional" de Colombia y que por eso se espera de las autoridades ecuatorianas "respuestas que hagan claridad sobre los v�nculos de las FARC en territorio ecuatoriano y los v�nculos de las FARC particularmente con el gobierno del presidente Correa".
Lunes 3 de marzo
L�deres en Am�rica Latina comenzaron a reaccionar ante la crisis diplom�tica.
La presidenta de Chile, Michelle Bachelet , le dijo a un medio local que es "una situaci�n que amerita una explicaci�n de Colombia a Ecuador y al conjunto de la regi�n".
El lider cubano Fidel Castro escribio en un articulo de prensa que Estados Unidos esta provocando una crisis regional entre Colombia y sus vecinos.
El presidente de Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, dijo que la muerte de Reyes era una dolorosa noticia y le expres� su solidaridad a las FARC y a Colombia.

Togo 'picked on' by Caf - Salifou
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
Aston Villa and Togo midfielder Moustapha Salifou feels his country's four-year ban from the Africa Cup of Nations is harsh, and the Confederation of African Football would not have treated a large country like Cameroon in such a way.

'In the wonderful shadow of Hitchcock'
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
A series of early Hitchcock films will be screened by the British Film Institute next summer, in a push to restore some of his early works made between 1925-29. The British composer Tansy Davies, who will write new scores to the films, and the violinist Aisha Orazbayeva discuss how the project will change our understanding of Alfred Hitchcock's work.
