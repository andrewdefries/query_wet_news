First anthrax fatality shakes New York
New York mail worker Dennis O'Neil warns people away from a building where anthrax spores were found
By BBC News Online's Megan Lane in New York
For a city typically in rude health, New York is suddenly under the weather - it has had its first anthrax death.
When the anthrax scare first began, the cases seemed isolated, traced back to a handful of letters sent to prominent government and media offices.
Now the disease has claimed an ordinary New Yorker as its victim. Let's get this in perspective - one death
Rudy GiulianiMayor of New York
Kathy Nguyen, who worked in the medical supply room at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, died on Wednesday of inhalation anthrax - the most serious form of the disease.
More than 1,110 staff, patients and visitors to the hospital have been given the antibiotic, Cipro, as a precaution.
And the city - already shaken by the 11 September terror attacks and anthrax scares - seems to be holding its breath, once more wary of what may lurk around the corner. Fear of the unknown
Dale Lewis, a nurse at the hospital, says the death of her co-worker has rammed the threat home: "Until now, I'd felt OK. Everybody's been a little edgy but [the anthrax threat] didn't affect us directly. I haven't changed my life - I still take the subway - but now when I'm in an enclosed elevator, I find myself wondering if I'm being exposed."
Dale Lewis: 'I sometimes wonderi if I'm being exposed'
It is the uncertainty which makes people jumpy. The authorities don't yet know how Ms Nguyen contracted the disease.
Although possible traces of anthrax have been found on her clothes, investigators have yet to discover where she came into contact with the disease. She lost consciousness before anyone could quiz her about her movements.
Mayor Rudy Giuliani has sought to allay New Yorkers' fears in his typical straight-talking fashion: "Let's get this in perspective - one death."
'We're the guinea pigs'
When anthrax panic first took hold in the US, many Americans rushed to their pharmacist in an attempt to get Cipro - against the advice of health officials, who warned that taking the antibiotic unnecessarily could make it less effective should the disease spread. The death in New York - and another suspected case of skin anthrax - has redoubled these fears. Spend any time in a pharmacy in the city, and no doubt there will be someone trying to buy Cipro. As a health professional herself, Ms Lewis would rather not be on the antibiotic.
"I'm concerned about building up immunity to anthrax," she says.
"I'm worried that health officials are putting us on the 'big guns' like Cipro when a lower strength antibiotic like penicillin would do the job. They're feeling their way through this, and we're the guinea pigs."
Thin blue line
In a city already on high alert, security has been stepped up this week. Not only did the government warn of new, albeit unspecified, terror attacks, the city hosted President George W Bush at a World Series baseball game on Tuesday.
Extra police have been drafted in for the city's Halloween parade and Sunday's marathon. Adam Sherbell: Not worried, yet
The high profile of New York's finest has set restaurant worker Adam Sherbell's mind at ease. "I work under the 59th St Bridge, which is a landmark, so of course I think about the warnings of another attack," he said.
"But the cops and the military are all around, and I'm confident they can prevent anything else happening. As for anthrax, I'm not a member of the news media or a postal worker, so I'm not worried about being exposed - yet.
"If it turns out that it's airborne, then I'll be worried."

Nelly: From St Louis to the world
Nelly has had huge hits with Country Grammar and Hot In Herre
Rapper Nelly is up for three awards at the Grammys in the United States on Sunday.
He has brought a new sound of hip hop to the music world, one informed by the Midwest of St Louis, Missouri, rather than the East or West Coast scenes.
When Nelly was in his teens he had an important decision to make: was his future in baseball or rapping?
The St Louis rapper - the man responsible for recent hip hop anthem Hot In Herre - may be one of the biggest new names in rap circles, but his career could have been very different.
Such was the teenage Nelly's prowess on the baseball pitch that he was tipped to be a player in the major league. But he decided, while still at high school, to turn to music
Baseball's loss was hip hop's gain.
Nelly has ushered in a completely new sound for hip hop, one that borrows some of the bravado of gangsta rap but lightens it with loping beats and a Southern drawl.
From the outset, Nelly's music stayed true to his roots, his accent a mix of southern and Midwestern typical of St Louis.
He has an unashamed delight in pop hooks alongside the rap star posturing.
Nelly was nominated at last year's Grammy awards
And Nelly has vowed to remain true to his roots , staying in St Louis rather than moving to the media capitals of New York or Los Angeles.
"When you move to big cities like L.A. and New York, that's when you get the reality part mixed up. What can I say? I'm just more of a Midwest guy," he told the Los Angeles Times last year.
Being away from the normal industry powerbases did not stop him becoming a huge star. He was born in 1979, real name Cornell Haynes Jr, the son of a retired Air Force officer and a mother who worked in fast food restaurants.
Baseball star
When he was in high school he started trying out for baseball teams, and was soon playing for the St Louis Amateur Baseball Assn, the first step towards a professional baseball career.
However, he was also making music with a group of friends. He formed a rap group called the St Lunatics when he was 16.
His friends urged him to make a solo career when they realised his talent for rapping.
Nelly's duet with Kelly Rowland has been a huge hit
Despite his solo success, Nelly is still an official member of the group and has helped each of his bandmates record and release solo albums.
Nelly's first success came with 2000's hit single Country Grammar, a tongue-twisting, mischievous track that went from underground favourite to bona-fide sensation.
The album Country Grammar, which followed soon after, became the tenth-biggest selling album of 2001 in the US.
Sticking plaster
He was nominated for a best rap solo performance at the Grammys in 2002.
As his fame grew, Nelly's image became synonymous with a sticking plaster on his cheek - the mystery of it remains, though it is rumoured to be a reminder of his brother who is in prison.
Nelly's success skyrocketed last year when Nellyville was released, spawning the massive hit Hot In Herre, a global bestseller despite being about the tale of a night spent trawling strip clubs.
But his biggest success has come with the duet Dilemma with Destiny's Child's Kelly Rowland, a hip-hop-styled ballad that spent weeks on the top of the US and UK charts.
The song has been shortlisted for record of the year at the Grammys this year, with Nelly also receiving nominations for album of the year and best male rap solo performance.
Nelly has definitely made the major leagues - just not in baseball.

Jon Sopel interview
Please note BBC Politics Show must be credited if any part of this transcript is used.
NB:This transcript was typed from a recording and not copied from an original script. Because of the possibility of mis-hearing and the difficulty, in some cases, of identifying individual speakers, the BBC cannot vouch for its accuracy.
On Politics Show, Sunday 23 April 2006, Jon Sopel interviewed:
John Prescott MP, Deputy Prime Minister
John Prescott MP, Deputy Prime Minister
Labour did overspend on last year's general election, but it will pay back the loans it took out, the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, told the Politics Show this week.
"We would deal with those problems and we will pay back loans where there's a requirement to do so, and that's one of the conditions of loans," he told Jon Sopel.
"We are always difficulty in finances. I mean if you look at the Labour Party's finances for decades now, we've always overspent at the election and during and after the election, we build up our resources to get ready for the next election. "So we will meet our commitments, that is not a problem for us."
His remarks were picked up by many of the national newspapers on Monday, as were his remarks about the local elections and negative advertising.
The Deputy Prime Minister urged Labour voters who were angry with the party over its policies on Iraq not to use the local elections as a protest vote: "I hear what you say in your programme there, that people are a bit upset about the national government on Iraq, and that may be the case. "But we always hope that in local elections, they'll vote for a good local council."
Mr Prescott dismissed concerns about Labour's latest party political broadcast, portraying the Conservative Leader, David Cameron, as a chameleon: "it's a bit of fun. "You might call it negative, it's a bit of fun and I think that's what happened there. People will laugh about it."
Interview with John Prescott
JON SOPEL: I'm joined now in the studio by the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, welcome to the Politics Show. It comes to quite a pass isn't it when one of your best councils, in your view, Camden, is in danger of losing control.
JOHN PRESCOTT: Well we'll wait and see but it's certainly a very good council. I think your film showed some - an interesting fact on British Waterways. I changed that around in 1997, so that they could work with the private sector and two billion pounds worth of investment have gone in to those canals, the Paddington Basin, and the renegotiation of the Channel Tunnel link has opened up the whole King's Cross, to massive rebuilding and refurbishment and I think to that extent, a combination of national government, working with local government, is what we have to put across in Camden, and Raj was saying that, all the money that has come in from central government has made a heck of a difference to the things - of becoming a very good council.
JON SOPEL: So then why are things so difficult if everything is so good.
JOHN PRESCOTT: Well I, well, when you say it's difficult, I'll wait to see the results, but of course it is said in Camden, I hear what you say in your programme there, that people are a bit upset about the national government on Iraq, and that may be the case. But we always hope that in local elections, they'll vote for a good local council. In fact, if you put out that good Council, you'll go to perhaps being a Liberal or Tory one, cos we can contrast Camden with in fact the liberal Islington, and both of them are pursuing entirely different policies - an anti social policy, as I've just heard there now, on the regeneration, and on wardens etc and the results are that crime is lower and falling in Camden, but increasing in Islington.
JON SOPEL: But do you think that the unpopularity of the Government nationally, is affecting local councils because it seems that a number of councils didn't even want Tony Blair to come in to the area.
JOHN PRESCOTT: Yeah, I hear that, but I also took - look at it, since you said we were going to talk about Camden, there are others who have been writing to the paper making very clear that a very good educational policy, which apparently people are coming in from other areas to come in to Camden is working very well for them, and they're praising and making that clear in the paper. Some councils, (fluffs) ... gone on record to say, we welcome Tony Blair coming. So you do get some for, some against, but inevitably, what Tony Blair represents is a major regeneration effect on King's Cross, on Camden and a national government and a local government working together for the people there. JON SOPEL: I mean just looking at all the leaflets, I mean we've got a whole pile of Labour leaflets here that have gone out. There's no mention, the word Tony Blair doesn't appear in any of these leaflets. A lot about Gordon Brown, a lot about Charles Clark, nothing about Tony Blair.
JOHN PRESCOTT: Well I don't know the context in which you're talking. You're maybe talking about Gordon Brown and the most successful economic economy we've had for an awful long time, which has meant a tremendous amount of increases for the local authority. In Charles Clark, probably about reducing crime, and pointing out how Camden has been more successful with the anti social order. (interjection) JON SOPEL: I suppose looking at it the other way, what they're saying is, Tony Blair is no longer an electoral asset. JOHN PRESCOTT: No, I think that's what you're saying actually. One or two councillors may say it there, I don't know, but the Leader clearly didn't, and others feel that that - what we ask you to judge us on, is basically what a national government has done to assist the local government. We allow them to make the decisions - again, compare Labour Camden and Liberal Islington, where the crime is going up, the education is not as good, this is a three four star local authority, and that is a combination of national government and local government. JON SOPEL: Would you agree that the run-up to these local council elections has hardly been ideal for you. The 'loans for peerages' row, allegations that you were trying to sell peerages in return for loans and ... (interjection)
JOHN PRESCOTT: Yeah, I notice the point you put on allegations. Lots of allegations are made constantly. In fact I think I was here on your last programme, where the papers were making allegations, not true by the way, but a lot of enquires are going on at the presentation - at the present moment, let's have a look at that. But let me be clear about it, as Tony Blair has made clear today, there is a very good political issue about the balance of liberties and indeed protection and safety and security in our times on the anti social issue and I think he was writing today in the Observer, making clear that the anti social orders are something that can make a real difference, and we see that between Camden and Islington, and this basil.. this balance between civil liberties and liberties are something that we have to get right and Tony Blair has made it absolutely clear, he's on the side of the majority, those that are being intimidated by the minority.
JON SOPEL: Just on the loans business for a moment because you did, as you said, you did come on and talk to us about it before.
JOHN PRESCOTT: Well you're just making allegations, why ... BOTH TOGETHER
JON SOPEL: I'm not making allegations, I was going to ask you a specific question.
JOHN PRSCOTT: Okay, okay. JON SOPEL: The specific question is this. There are a number of people who've loaned money, who say they want the money back, more or less immediately. Would the Labour Party be bankrupted by that? JOHN PRESCOTT: No. No, we would deal with those problems and we will pay back loans where there's a required to do, and that's one of the conditions of loans.
JON SOPEL: Would it make life difficult for you if ... JOHN PRESCOTT: Oh, we are always difficulty in finances. I mean if you look at the Labour Party's finances for decades now, we're always overspent at the election and during after the election, we build up our resources to get ready for the next election. So we will meet our commitments, that is not a problem for us.
JON SOPEL: And what about on the health service as well, as another, hardly ideal, the Royal College of Nursing talking about - there are thirteen thousand jobs about to go. And yet you have Patricia Hewitt saying this is the best year ever for the NHS. Would you describe it as the best year ever for the NHS.
JOHN PRESCOTT: I think the health service is in the best state it's ever been for decades. We've now got a hundred new and improved hospitals, we've got over a hundred thousand more nurses, consultants and doctors now working in to our health service. We've doubled the amount of money that has gone in to health, yes, there are some problems on the margins, because we're requiring, in reform, to get adjustments and those debts you're talking about�. (interjection) JON SOPEL: But if your operation (overlaps) ... if your operation has been cancelled because staff have been laid off, you don't say, this is a problem on the margins. JOHN PRESCOTT: Hang on, hang on, put it in perspective. We're now doing a million more patients on the National Health (fluffs) ... we did it before. When I hear, was it either Davis or Cameron, talking about - what was the quote he used, about it wasn't good enough or it's worse or something like that - when you compare what we've done, to what in fact has happened under the previous administration, we have made major, fundamental changes, and we've kept to one very important principle, that the treatment is based upon need and you're your ability to pay. That's a success record, however you measure it. JON SOPEL: Okay, you talk about David Cameron, you made a speech a few months back describing David Cameron as a chameleon, and then hey presto, we got a party election broadcast where that's all he is. He's a chameleon, what did you think of that. JOHN PRESCOTT: We I think - when I did my speech, what I did, was trying to point out, he's says I'm a Liberal now, then he says he's a Tory, blue - and now he said if you vote Tony Blue, you can get Green, I just made a bit of a fun about the different colours, and I suppose now because he's been to Norway, watching him there, you could describe him as white. Look, it's fun in politics, a little bit of humour doesn't really ... JON SOPEL: But it's negative, it's unremittingly negative. JOHN PRESCOTT: Well okay, okay. Let me just clear with that one. A little humour doesn't, doesn't harm the political system I think, if you can treat it that way. But there must be a very important political measure, measure, message in it and that political message undoubtedly is the one that he has different views to what he had before, and he keeps changing, and he identifies it with other political parties; it's hard to keep up with him, but at the end of the day he's set up these commissions, he says he's going to tell us what the policy is, and how he can be a good environmentalist, when he voted against the climate charge, charge levy, is the point we make - he changes. And even in that film that we had as a political broadcast, his tongue went out - what did he get, minimum wage. This was a man who fought against minimum wage and now says he accepts it.
JON SOPEL: But isn't it because he's doing so well and that you've become rattled that you don't about your nine years in office and what you've achieved, you just attack Cameron.
JOHN PRESCOTT: Well why didn't you ask me about the nine years then.
JON SOPEL: I've asked you about the record ... (interjection) ..
JOHN PRESCOTT: (overlaps) JON SOPEL: I'm asking you about your record in Camden and now I'm asking you.
JOHN PRESCOTT: And I've just tried to give you that. JON SOPEL: Quite specifically ... about the one party election broadcast we've see and it's unremittingly negative.
JOHN PRESCOTT: Well, no, it's a bit of fun. You might call it negative, it's a bit of fun and I think that's what happened there. People will laugh about it. But they will judge us on the positive things. Now we got three broadcasts to have right - let's see what the range of those broadcasts are. We will stay. The big issue, as I've been trying to say is the anti social orders. I'm told that's a threat to the liberties. Why don't we have those kind of discussions which have been opened by the Prime Minister today, who's now made it clear that he's on the side of the majority that is being intimidated by a minority, where one family can make it a real terror on the streets in a particular area, and he wants to act strongly against them, and he's for the majority. And he is right. Blair is right to be for the majority, being intimidated by some minorities JON SOPEL: Okay, just on terms of the results of these elections. What constitutes success. JOHN PRESCOTT: Er winning. JON SOPEL: And so what's a bad result. Losing? How many?
JOHN PRESCOTT: Yes, well I don't know, we'll wait and see what happens but we always want to put our case, and if the people then decide, and as you have already been making clear from the beginning of this programme, sometimes unfairly, the national policies are interfering with local. In Camden where we've used an example, they've undoubtedly got a record you should be voting for them. If they've got difficulties about national policies, it's not fair to put it on the local authority, but it's not unknown.
JON SOPEL: So manage ... your expectation here - if you lose more than a hundred and fifty seats, is that bad or is that to be expected. JOHN PRESCOTT: Well we want to win as many seats as we can and we're fighting to win as many seats as we can, and these elections come every year. Next year there will be the local elections, and the devolution in Wales and Scotland. And we'll judge it as it comes. But for a government of course, our elections won't come till four or five years will it. JON SOPEL: You talked about the last time you were on the programme when you said about Tony Blair, the whole loans business could speed up his departure from Downing Street, and you said, I think the timetable is ... JOHN PRESCOTT: I didn't say that by the way. JON SOPEL: You said the timetable in people's minds is still reasonably the same.
JOHN PRESCOTT: Yeah.
JON SOPEL: Whose minds are ... (interjection)
JOHN PRESCOTT: Well (fluffs) it was nothing to do with the loans affecting. I - you asked me about the timetable. What you were suggested there, somehow the loans affected it. I didn't say that at all. What I did say, the timetable is still in its order. When the Prime Minister made clear he wants to go, we'll make the appropriate, take the appropriate ... JON SOPEL: When is that.
JOHN PRESCOTT: ... decisions to replace. Well that's for the Prime Minister to tell us. JON SOPEL: Do you know. JOHN PRESCOTT: Er, no, I will er, I know what it is frankly, that is that it must come before the next election. JON SOPEL: Right. And that's as much as Gordon Brown knows as well JOHN PRESCOTT: Er, that's - what we all know until the Prime Minister makes his decision. JON SOPEL: And the local elections won't have changed anything. JOH PRESCOTT: No, I don't think so. We'll go on implementing. Twelve months ago we fought ... JON SOPEL: A disastrous result doesn't change anything JOHN PRESCOTT: Well wait a minute, wait a minute. Twelve months ago, we had a manifesto, and we had to get on with implementing that manifesto. And if you look at the Tories, quite frankly, do you remember before - going back in to the early '90s, they had some very, we had some lousy local election, good election results, and the Tories went on to lose it. JON SOPEL: Okay.
JOHN PRESCOTT: To win it, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
JON SOPEL: John Prescott ... JOHN PRESCOTT: Not my day today. JON SOPEL: John Prescott, well we're glad to have had you on the Politics Show, thanks very much indeed.
JOHN PRESCOTT: Okay.

Supermarket tries out smart tagging
Tesco has gone shopping for smart goods
Smart razor blades have been introduced to the shelves of UK supermarket Tesco.
In a trial at Tesco's Newmarket Road branch in Cambridge, the packaging of Gillette Mach3 razor blades has been fitted with tiny chips.
The electronic radio tags will allow staff and customers to keep track of the goods in the store, according to Computing Magazine.
They will also help prevent shoplifting, tracking the razors from the shelf to the till and out of the door. If the product goes through the door without being paid for an alarm is set off.
Improved availability
All kinds of goods could be tagged
The tags could feature on a wide range of food and non-food products in the future, telling staff which items are in stock, whereabouts they can be found and when they go out of date.
"Tagging products will lead to real improvements for both customers and staff with instant information and improved availability," said Tesco Technology director Colin Cobain.
The radio frequency identity tags have been developed by the Auto-ID Centre, a standards group set up at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and with research labs at Cambridge University.
Successor to barcodes
The smart tags are wirelessly connected to readers placed around the store on shelves and at the check-out.
Such tags are an improvement on old-fashioned barcodes because they can be read from a distance, speeding up the process of checking goods.
In the future, readers could be attached to distribution lorries and warehouses allowing supermarkets to keep track of the whole supply chain in a particular area.
The radio tags of the future could even remove the need to have check-out desks altogether as well as providing a new level of smart goods such as ice-cream that can tell your fridge if the temperature is too high.

Kenya in crisis
Kenya turmoil Raila's role
Tribal anger
By Paul Mason
BBC Newsnight business correspondent
Newsnight correspondent Paul Mason travels through Kenya using a map of the country's mobile phone networks as his guide. Part two of this story appears tomorrow.
The mobile phone is having a huge impact all across Africa
Kenya mobiles
"How big a change have cellphones made to Africa?" I shout the question at Isis Nyong'o, over the throbbing bassline of a Kenyan ragga track. She tells me calmly: "It's had about the same effect as a democratic change of leadership."
I'd expected hype from a Kenyan-American executive at MTV Networks Africa but by now I believed the hype myself. It was not the bling, the fashion models with candy-floss hair - it was the Nairobi teenagers mobbing the entrance to the city's Carnivore club and overwhelming the Motorola stall. If this was just an event for the elite then neither MTV nor Motorola would be there. Kenyans have been voting via SMS for their favourite rap stars, and the whole event has been promoted via mobiles.
With one in three adults carrying a cellphone in Kenya, mobile telephony is having an economic and social impact which is hard to grasp if you are used to living in a country with good roads, democracy and the internet. In five years the number of mobiles in Kenya has grown from one million to 6.5 million - while the number of landlines remains at about 300,000, mostly in government offices.
Big change
I decided to make a journey through Kenya to gauge the impact on the ground: the plan was to go from Mombasa via Nairobi to Lake Victoria following the mobile network map - contrasting life on the network to life off it. Kenya's rap award winners were chosen by text message
"Hard luck," said my driver, Daniel Wambugu. About 80% of Kenyans are covered by mobile networks and while it would be easy to find a place off the network, finding people there would be difficult. He suggested dropping Lake Victoria for somewhere in the Rift Valley to see if we could find a remote Masai village. Right, I said.
But first there was Mombasa to take in. It's a city with a sleepy, post-colonial feel where the most dynamic people are the Matatu drivers who zip between the traffic, shouting and bawling and getting themselves arrested, breaking down and (they allege) bribing the cops to let them earn their daily bread.
These manic minibuses drive their owners mad. "Sometimes you don't sleep," said Abdul Khan, who owns three. The two big problems are repairs and bribing the police, he tells me. As it turns out the whole Matatu industry has been revolutionised by the mobile phone. It's not rocket science, it's just that if you need a new brake block, you don't have to walk to the shop, find the owner, do lots of face to face business, walk back, have lunch etc. Likewise with getting your driver out of the police station. Business happens faster. Cash culture
Soon you will even be able to pay for a trip by Matutu by mobile phone. To find out how I zipped across Mombasa to the offices of Safaricom, one of the two network providers in Kenya, part owned by Vodafone. It let me film the launch of a project called M-Pesa - and, read my lips, I said "launch" not "trial". M-Pesa does not look spectacular. It is simply an extra line on your mobile phone menu that says: "Send Money". You go to an office, transfer funds onto your phone account, and then send them to your friends, or family, or anybody else with a mobile. Then, they go to an office, show the code on the mobile and some ID, and collect the cash. M-Pesa could make mobile payments a reality
Even just working in Kenya it's going to revolutionise things - because plastic money and bank accounts are not greatly in evidence in this country as more than 50% of its people are classed as living in abject poverty. But once it goes global - and Vodafone says it will - then the $93bn of remittance money sent by migrants to developing countries each year could start flowing this way. Basically mobiles could be about to make Africa a very much more liquid economy.
After this I set off on my journey from Mombasa to Nairobi up the single highway that links East Africa's main port with the interior: it was a case study in what's been wrong in countries like Kenya.
Despite millions of dollars in aid money, the Kenyan government never quite got round to finishing the road. This key piece of infrastructure is now being upgraded by Chinese engineers in return for an oil deal. It is testimony to the kleptocratic elite's inability to do the simplest things. Even the railway that runs alongside the road is, say locals, similarly shambolic. Contrast that to the mobile network which it is excellent all the way along this main artery.
It was built in four years, by Celtel and Safaricom. Admitted, building a network of generators and masts is easier than laying mile after mile of tarmac in an area known for man eating predators - but to many Kenyans the contrast is telling.

Funeral for Cornish Nimrod victim
Flt Lt Gareth Nicholas leaves a wife and daughter
The funeral has taken place of a Cornish airman who died in a plane crash in Afghanistan in September.
Flt Lt Gareth Nicholas, 40, from Newquay, was among 14 service personnel killed when an RAF Nimrod MR2 came down near Kandahar.
The funeral service was held at St Columb Minor Church, near Newquay.
Flt Lt Nicholas, who was married with a 10-year-old daughter, was one of 12 RAF crew on the plane. A Royal Marine and an army soldier were also on board.
'Seasoned maritime aviator'
It was the biggest loss for the RAF since a Hercules was shot down by enemy forces in Iraq two years previously.
Flt Lt Nicholas had served at RAF St Mawgan, near Newquay, before being posted to RAF Kinloss where he lived with his wife, Helen, and daughter, Athena. His parents and one of his sisters still live in Cornwall.
During the service, 10-year-old Athena read out a poem that she had written in memory of her father.
Flt Lt Nicholas's coffin was draped in St Piran's flag after the service
His wife described him as a fun-loving, caring, enthusiastic and energetic man who doted on his daughter. They had just celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary.
His coffin was draped in a union jack flag into the church, but his Cornish roots were acknowledged by its being draped in a St Piran's flag as it was brought out after the service.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "Flt Lt Gareth Nicholas was a seasoned maritime aviator, an experienced professional weapons systems officer and a former acoustics operator. "Over the years, Gareth's cheerful and easy-going nature made him many friends in the maritime fleet and in the wider community."

Iraq inquiry hears evidence behind closed doors
Gen Sir John Reith gave evidence in private for "personal reasons"
The Iraq Inquiry met behind closed doors to hear evidence from the general who ran the British operations in the conflict, it has emerged.Gen Sir John Reith said he should be allowed to appear without the press and public present "for personal reasons". A full transcript of his evidence was published with five words blanked out, which the inquiry said was on "national security" grounds. The panel said this was "unrelated" to the hearing being held in private. However, it gave no further details. General electionAlthough Sir John Chilcot, who leads the panel, has pledged to hear as much evidence in public as possible, the committee said it decided that the personal grounds laid out by Gen Reith meant "there was a genuine reason why he would have difficulty appearing in public if it were to be broadcast". Earlier in the week Tony Blair's ex-spokesman Alastair Campbell appeared before the panel and told the inquiry he "defends every single word" of the 2002 dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. He said parts could have been "clearer" but it did not "misrepresent" Iraq's threat. The inquiry is set to adjourn ahead of the general election campaign. Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Foreign Secretary David Miliband are among those set to appear before the inquiry after the election. However, Mr Brown has faced calls to give evidence to before the election. Tony Blair's appearanceLiberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said people were "entitled" to know the prime minister's role in the decision to go to war before voting, since Mr Brown was the chancellor at the time and had therefore "signed the cheques". The Conservatives also said it would be "preferable" for him to give evidence to the inquiry before the election, rather than afterwards. However, the prime minister told MPs he was acting on the inquiry's recommendations over timings and said he "stood by" the decision to go to war. Former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw will give evidence to the inquiry next week with former Prime Minister Tony Blair expected to appear at a later date. The Iraq Inquiry's final report is due to be published by early next year.

Thousands party at Mardi Gras
Extravagant outfits were the order of the day at Coopers Field The plight of gay people who face persecution over their sexuality was highlighted at Cardiff's Mardi Gras festival. Thousands attended the event, which is the second biggest of its kind in the UK.
It was the fifth year the lesbian and gay event has been held and organisers said they had anticipated a crowd of 40,000.
It was one of the most colourful festivals to hit the city as many turned up in fancy dress.
But the event was also used by Amnesty International campaigners to highlight the issue of many countries around the world with laws forbidding same sex relationships. The activists drew attention to the situation of gay men in Egypt who, they say, face arrest, prosecution, torture and imprisonment for their sexuality. Eleanor White, programme director of Amnesty, said that that more than 70 countries around the world criminalises homosexuality.
"It is not just gay men, it is lesbians, gay men, and people who are bisexual," she said.
People here have experienced discrimination and you can make that connection with other people in the world
Eleanor White, Amnesty International
"In countries like Jamaica, Zimbabwe, Ecuador - just to name a few, there are huge problems in criminalising homosexuality and also in state sponsored hate crime which is torture, beatings, stoning and sometimes killing people, simply because of who they are," she said.
Ms White said they hoped by highlighting the issue at Cardiff's Mardi Gras, they could bring international pressure on the countries who outlaw homosexuality.
"We know that international pressure works on these governments and we know that lesbian, gay, transsexual people want to make a difference and they do feel a sense of solidarity.
"People here have experienced discrimination and you can make that connection with other people in the world," she added.
The Mardi Gras, was held at Coopers Field in the city centre.
About 40,000 people were expected to attend the event
Haydn Price, marketing officer for the event said the day was a success.
"It is a massive event - it is the second largest event of its kind in the country," he said.
"And this year's was the best yet - we haven't had a chance to count up the numbers yet, but we know that we had more people than last year.
"It was a tremendous day and everyone enjoyed it.
"It was a bit slow to start off but it soon picked up and although we did have a shower in the afternoon, it didn't dampen things too much.
"We are looking forward to next year's event now," he added.

Nakamura takes top player award
Nakamura has enjoyed a great season with Celtic
Celtic's Shunsuke Nakamura completed an unforgettable day by being named the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year.
The award came just hours after the Japanese star had scored the goal that clinched the SPL title for his club.
Nakamura's Celtic team-mates Artur Boruc and Lee Naylor were on the shortlist of nominees, along with Aberdeen skipper Russell Anderson.
Celtic's Gordon Strachan picked up the inaugural manager of the year prize.
Strachan has steered Celtic to a successful defence of their SPL title, reached the last 16 of the Champions League and has a Scottish Cup final to look forward to.
Japanese playmaker Nakamura has been a key player for Scotland's dominant side and Sunday's match-winning strike was his 10th goal of the season.
Nakamura, who is in his second season in Scotland since his �2.5m transfer from Italian club Reggina, said: "I'm very pleased but this isn't something you can get on your own - it's down to the whole team and also the supporters.
I'm a bit shocked but delighted
Steven Naismith
"All the players deserved to get this award. For example, a player like Neil Lennon is not really in the limelight but he is so important in the background and without players like him we wouldn't have our style of play."
Nakamura also won Goal of the Season for his cheeky lob against Dundee United on Boxing Day, which earned Celtic a 2-2 draw.
However, Celtic were denied a cleansweep when Aiden McGeady was beaten to the Young Player of the Year by Kilmarnock striker Steven Naismith.
Naismith, 20, picked up the same award from the Scottish Football Writers last year and was thrilled to complete a personal double.
"I'm a bit shocked but delighted," he said. "I said when I won the award last year that I didn't want to be remembered as a one-hit wonder and hopefully I've shown this season that I can still hold my own."
Other winners on the night were: Colin McMenamin (First Division Player of the Year); Iain Russell (Second Division Player of the Year); Scott Chaplain (Third Division Player of the Year); Falkirk (Community Club of the Year); Eusebio (Special Merit Award).

Ireland 21-23 South Africa
Ireland (6) 21Tries: Bowe, Kearney Cons: O'Gara Pens: Sexton 3South Africa (13) 23 Tries: Smith, Aplon Cons: Steyn, Lambie Pens: Steyn 3
Highlights - Ireland 21-23 South Africa
Ireland narrowly failed to win the first Test at the new Aviva Stadium as South Africa survived a storming fightback by the hosts in Dublin.A penalty from Morne Steyn - who later saw his successful run of Test kicks end at 41 - and converted Juan Smith try gave the Boks a 10-0 lead. Three Jonny Sexton penalties and two further Steyn efforts made it 16-9. Gio Aplon's score sent the Boks clear and a converted Tommy Bowe try and Rob Kearney's late effort were not enough. Bowe's try was set up by a pin-point kick from replacement fly-half Ronan O'Gara, who came on for Sexton to win his 100th Test cap.

Well done to the Springboks, this was a tense affair and you can only give credit to the forward pack of SA who dominated the tight exchanges tonight

Ireland had been chasing a fourth consecutive win over the world champions, who were missing half a dozen first choice players, but instead their recent poor run continued as they slipped to a fourth defeat in a row. The Irish Rugby Football Union had admitted to mistakes in its ticketing policy
ahead of the match, which meant it would be some way short of a sell-out. And the first international at the shiny new arena, which has risen on the site of the draughty but much-loved old Lansdowne Road, was duly some way short of being rammed to the rafters. Banks of green seats paid testament to the errors of the Irish hierarchy off the pitch and they were mirrored by plenty of mistakes on the field from the hosts in the opening stages. Fly-half Steyn gave the visitors an early lead with a penalty before Ireland handed the visitors the opening try on a plate.

With 17 minutes played, blind-side flanker Smith intercepted an Eoin Reddan pass and powered half the length of the pitch before the unerring boot of Steyn converted from out wide. Sexton then missed a very kickable penalty for the hosts as their opening night party began to turn into a damp squib - appropriate, given the heavy rain in Dublin. Sexton finally found his range just before the half-hour mark with a penalty and although Steyn landed his second penalty, Sexton's boot made it 13-6 to the Boks at the break. A historic occasion had fallen some way short of expectations so far but there was a momentous occurrence soon after the break, as the prolific Steyn saw his remarkable run of consecutive kicks in Tests come to an end at a scarcely-credible 41. It was a long-range but straight effort that went awry but he was on target from out wide 10 minutes later as the visitors edged back into a 10-point lead.

Ireland desperately needed some inspiration and their fans did their best to lift them, Sexton rewarding a powerful scrummaging effort with his third penalty after 55 minutes to bring the hosts within a converted try. Replacement South Africa fly-half Patrick Lambie missed his first kick in Test rugby but the visitors claimed a decisive lead with 15 minutes remaining when the diminutive but distinctly rapid Aplon scissored with Zane Kirchner by the touchline before racing over under the posts. Lambie, only 20, opened his international account with the simple conversion and the game looked done and dusted, only for Ireland to suddenly come to life. The hosts turned to O'Gara and he wound back the clock to 2009 with a precise chip as he and Bowe produced a repeat of Ireland's Grand Slam-winning try in Cardiff. O'Gara converted and the crowd nearly lifted the new roof clean off its bearings when Kearney crossed out wide to finish off a sustained multi-phased attack sparked by a Jamie Heaslip breakout. O'Gara had the chance to level the scores from wide out but his conversion attempt hit the post, and the hosts were unable to engineer a chance for further points as South Africa held on to ruin their opening night party.
