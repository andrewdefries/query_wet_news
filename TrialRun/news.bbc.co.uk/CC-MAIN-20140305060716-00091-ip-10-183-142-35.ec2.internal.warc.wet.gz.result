Tensions high in Zanzibar
Some donors have withheld aid from Zanzibar
By East Africa correspondent Cathy Jenkins
With parliamentary and presidential elections due at the end of next month in Zanzibar, international human rights groups and donor countries are watching closely the progress of a case involving 18 opposition party members who have been detained for almost three years on charges of treason. Defence lawyers are awaiting the result of an appeal against the holding of the trial of 18 members of the Civic United Front, Zanzibar's main opposition party. The opposition says the 18 are being held for political reasons. The opposition says the 1995 elections were rigged
The case has drawn the attention of international human rights groups and also Western donor countries, who are withholding aid from Zanzibar because of concerns over its human rights record. Political tension in Zanzibar has been high since the CUF accused the ruling CCM party of rigging the last elections, in 1995, to stay in power. Semi-autonomous
The Indian Ocean islands which make up Zanzibar enjoy semi-autonomous status within Tanzania and have their own parliament and president. The islands have their own regional government
The current President, Salmin Amour, who will stand down in the October elections, has urged the leaders of the other parties to forget the past, but he has made no mention of the 18. The treason case is highly sensitive for the Zanzibar authorities. Jokha Khalif Seif says she only sees her husband, Machano Hamis Ali, once every two weeks and never alone. Every day she prepares food in the kitchen of her flat to give to a prison guard, who hands it over to her husband in jail. After interviewing her in her home, the BBC team was detained by police waiting outside her flat. We were questioned for 45 minutes before being released.

Pope Benedict XVI and Islam
The Pope's comments came on a visit to Germany
As Pope Benedict XVI faces criticism from Muslim leaders for remarks made during a speech in Germany, the BBC's religious affairs correspondent, Rahul Tandon, looks at earlier views he expressed during his time as a cardinal.
This is not the first time Pope Benedict has been at the centre of criticism for his views on Islam. Before becoming Pope, Cardinal Ratzinger, as he was known, was considered a theological conservative. He appeared to be uncomfortable with Pope John Paul II's attempts to improve dialogue with the Islamic world. His predecessor was the first pontiff to step inside a mosque, during a visit to Syria in 2001. During his time as a cardinal, Pope Benedict opposed Turkey's bid to join the European Union, saying it belonged to a different cultural sphere, adding that its admission would be a grave error against the tide of history. And in 1996, he wrote that Islam had difficulty in adapting to modern life. 'New barbarism'
However, since his consecration, Pope Benedict has surprised many with his attempts to improve dialogue with the Muslim world. He is due to visit Turkey in November as part of that process. But there have been signs of his earlier views. Last year he accused Muslim leaders in Germany of failing to steer their youth from what he described as the darkness of a new barbarism. Pope Benedict is under increasing pressure to clarify the remarks he made during his speech at Regensburg University. For many, that will require a clarification of the relationship he wishes to develop between the Catholic Church and Islam.

Car bomb kills Pakistani soldiers
Pakistani troops have been battling Taleban fighters near the border
Eight Pakistani soldiers have been killed in a suicide bomb attack on a security base near the border with Afghanistan, officials have said.
The bomber drove his vehicle into a convoy leaving the base in Wana, the main town in the north-western province of South Waziristan, they added.
Correspondents say the restive tribal area is considered a haven for al-Qaeda and Taleban-linked militants.
Troops have been deployed to combat the militants, but attacks have continued.
Pakistan's chief army spokesman, Maj-Gen Athar Abbas, said the bomber had targeted a convoy leaving the base in Wana, where troops were protecting a deployment of Pakistan's Frontier Corps.
"I can confirm eight soldiers were killed," he told the BBC.
"The convoy was just leaving the fort when the attack happened. We believe the actual target was the fort itself."
The attack came two days after suspected US missile strikes in the region killed about 20 people.
Maj-Gen Abbas said he believed Sunday's bombing could have been a response by militants in the area.
Locals told the BBC that security forces had closed down the main road in the area following the attack, forcing traffic off the road.
Ongoing operations
South Waziristan, a tribal district in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), was the first significant sanctuary Islamist militants carved for themselves outside Afghanistan after the US-led invasion of that country in 2001. In recent times, Azam Warsak has been the scene of many such attacks on the Pakistani soldiers, the BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan reports from Islamabad.
On 22 June 2002, it was the scene of the first operation against al-Qaeda by the Pakistan army. The army lost 11 soldiers on that day, which marked the beginning of conflict between the army, al-Qaeda and the Taleban.
The area is currently controlled by Taleban commander Mullah Nazir, who is believed to be behind many cross-border attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan.
Mullah Nazir rose to prominence in March 2007, when he chased Uzbek militants from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) out of South Waziristan, our correspondent says.
He was on good terms with the Pakistani army until the recent missile strikes began in Waziristan.
Local residents say Friday's attack has heightened tensions, and could cause major problems for the army in Waziristan.
This could complicate matters, as security forces are still caught up in a massive operation in the nearby tribal region of Bajaur.

Waiters' tips laws under scrutiny
Waiters' tips are sometimes shared between staff and employers
The government is to look into laws around tips in restaurants, saying it was "not clear" if owners who kept a share were breaking the law.
Even leaving a cash tip was no guarantee the money would go to the waiter, peers were told.
Minister Baroness Vadera said tips could even count towards the minimum wage, if they were put through payroll.
The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) has agreed to consider the issue, she said.
The UK's largest union, Unite, is campaigning to stop service charges being diverted into restaurants' takings, or being used to "top up" salaries to make the minimum wage.
'Dishonourable scam'
In the House of Lords earlier, Lib Dem peer Lord Lee asked what powers the government had to ensure tips went to staff, and not to restaurant owners.
He urged the government to look into the "dishonourable scam" where some employers keep tips or use them to top up the minimum wage. This is a complicated issue but we will consider it
Baroness Vadera
Lady Vadera told peers that restaurants operated a "wide variety of practices" which the government did not regulate in detail.
Tips can count towards the minimum wage, but only when they have gone through the employer's payroll, she said.
Asked whether restaurants could be made to put their tips policy on their menus, peers were told the only rules around it were that customers be forewarned if a service charge was automatically added onto the bill.
Prosecutable
"They do not currently have to disclose whether or not that is going to go to staff and ... that is something that needs to be considered," Lady Vadera said.
She agreed there were "issues of concern" and said BERR had agreed to consider the issue and "take all representations into account", including the British Hospitality Association and the unions.
But she warned that tighter enforcement of tips might led employers to cut wages or raise prices to compensate, which might put diners off tipping.
"This is a complicated issue but we will consider it," she said.
One independent peer, Lord Bledisloe, a QC, said managers were committing theft if they took tips intended for staff - and theft was prosecutable. The minister replied: "It is not clear in the law because it could be that the restaurant takes the service charge as part of its revenue, then passes it on to the employee then pays NICS [National Insurance contributions] on it so the situation is unclear."
Peers were told but most restaurants run a "tronc" system, where someone holds the tips to be passed to waiting and kitchen staff.
"But that does not mean that in all cases it is illegal for this to be shared by the owners or the managers," said Lady Vadera.

History: Dunfermline Building Society
The Dunfermline is to be put up for sale by the government after it effectively collapsed with a massive loss.
Here, the BBC Scotland news website outlines the building society's history from its conception in 1869 to being put on the market in 2009. 29 MARCH 2009
Prime Minister Gordon Brown moved to reassure savers in the Dunfermline that their money was safe.
His comments came as Scotland's largest building society effectively collapsed after incurring losses last year of £26m. The Treasury ruled out a taxpayer-funded bailout of between £60m and £100m after regulators decided the move was not viable. The building society's chairman Jim Faulds criticised Treasury officials who he said had refused to talk to the Dunfermline to help secure its future. 28 MARCH 2009
Regulators decided the Dunfermline was no longer viable, with a £26m loss expected to be announced next week.
The Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the UK government forced the sale of the building society. Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy said the Dunfermline's exposure to risky assets, £9m plus losses on its IT business and its involvement in the subprime mortgage market had "jeopardised its entire future". First Minister Alex Salmond said the Scottish Government had offered a capital contribution to help maintain the Dunfermline as an independent institution, and to provide guarantees that would protect its role in lending for social housing in Scotland. 23 MARCH 2009
The Dunfermline was involved in intensive talks with the financial regulator over its future.
It came after speculation that the mutual was having problems with its cash flow and needed an injection of capital. Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy and Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pledged that their administrations would do whatever they could to help the building society. The Dunfermline refused to comment on the story. AUGUST 2008
Bank of England figures showed that UK building societies appeared to be lending only a handful of new mortgages to home buyers.
The statistics suggested the Dunfermline had become more cautious, particularly about lending on newly built properties, such as those in city centres or waterfronts. Its operations director, Peter Craigie, said its residential mortgage pipeline at the end of July was down 50% on a year ago. He said the building society was expecting a quieter second half of the year. FEBRUARY 2008
The Dunfermline is now one of only two lenders in the 100%-plus mortgage market.
The building society and Scottish Widows were the only providers left offering 100% mortgages, after the Bradford and Bingley and Mortgage Express pulled deals. The mortgage and loan deals which allow people to borrow more than the value of their home had been criticised for letting people take on large debts. Birmingham Midshires, the last lender offering so-called 125% mortgages, pulled them from the market. 2007
The Dunfermline reported profits of £2.2m.
This was 61.4% down on the previous year. The building society announced that it would become sole funder of Weslo Housing Management, the Bathgate-based registered social landlord in a £34m deal. This took the Dunfermline well above the £600m mark in respect of social housing lending. 2006
In December, the building society had total assets of £3.3bn.
By the end of the previous year, it had 34 branches and 38 agencies throughout Scotland. About 20% of its business was generated from outwith Scotland. The society was also leading the way in investment in social housing north of the border. 1999
The building society launched its telephone banking service, Dunfermline Direct.
The mutual said it complemented its existing network of 34 branches and provided services to those who do not work or live close to a branch. It said it was introducing new services "to meet the demands of the modern world". The new system provided a range of accounts and services to those who found it more convenient to transact business by telephone. 1994
The Dunfermlines's new head office was opened.
Caledonia House was built at the south side of Dunfermline, on Carnegie Campus. The building society's website said its construction showed "an ongoing commitment to our customers, staff and the society's future". The mutual has been based in the Fife town since its formation in 1869. 1869
The building society was established in the town from which it takes its name.
It was formed as a mutual organisation and, according to its website, "profits made are sufficient only to provide for the costs of the business". It expanded throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries and acquired more than 20 other organisations. These included the Stenhousemuir, Peebles, Fourth Fifeshire Investment Company, the Stirlingshire, and the Edinburgh and Paisley Building Society.

1981: 'Gang of four' launches new party
VIDEO : Scenes from the SDP's official launch
The Social Democrats have launched their new political party pledging to "reconcile the nation" and "heal divisions between classes".
At a crowded press conference in London, signalling the start of a massive media campaign to recruit supporters, the party outlined its hopes of breaking the political mould and of making significant gains at the next General Election.
The Gang of Four, the nick-name of the four Labour defectors who set up the SDP, outlined their hopes of winning, with the Liberals, a majority in the Commons.
Roy Jenkins, former Labour cabinet minister, David Owen, William Rodgers and Shirley Williams published a 12-point document covering elections, education and international co-operation.
"We are going to be free"
David Owen
The party's proposals included calls to reform the political system, environmentally friendly policies, equality of opportunity for women and ethnic minorities, and a fairer distribution of wealth.
Mr Jenkins said formulating an incomes policy would be "one of the most difficult things we have to do".
The Gang of Four describe themselves as a left-of-centre party and is the first to be run in Britain with a one-member one-vote system for policies and selection.
Dr Owen said the party offered Britain a fresh start and he said recruits were coming from other parties all the time.
"We are going to be free: we will make decisions... But they will be your decisions," he told potential members.
He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of having divided the country between the North, Scotland, Wales, and the still "relatively prosperous" South East.
The four left Labour citing major differences over European and defence policies as the party has taken a sharp turn to the left under leader Michael Foot. The opposition leader has insisted they will win no support.
But with call centres waiting to hear from future supporters and an estimated �170,000 spent on regional journeys and advertising, the SDP is determined to win over MPs and then voters.
In Context
The party joined forces with the Liberal Party to create the Liberal-SDP Alliance in autumn 1981. It enjoyed increasing support but by the 1987 general election the Alliance was weakened by high Labour support. After the election, Liberal Party leader David Steel proposed an official merger with the SDP and while most of the SDP's membership voted in favour of the merger, its leader David Owen remained adamantly opposed to it.
He pledged to fight the now new Social and Liberal Democrat Party (SLD). But by 1990, the party had lost a great deal of credibility and support and the SDP was folded. 'I was a founding member'
"Ah - the gang of four - Shirl the Pearl, Egghead Roy, Arrogant Dave and that other chap.
I was hugely impressed by their agenda. So impressed, in fact, that I became a founder member of the party. A couple of years later, I was elected as one of their District Councillors. There were only ever a few hundred of us, but on my council (St Albans), we became the ruling group, along with our chums the Liberals (as they were then). I even became Deputy Leader of the Council.
I was young and idealistic, and of course, I've become older and a little more cynical. However, I'd still go anywhere to hear Shirley Williams speak.
"

Lewes relegated after rivals draw
Lewes have become the first club in the top five divisions to be relegated after other results in the Blue Square Premier went against them on Tuesday.
York and Grays both drew to get to 39 points each, out of the reach of Lewes who have only seven games left. The Sussex club have won only four games this term, losing 30 and conceding 77 goals in being relegated. Ebbsfleet, Woking and Northwich occupy the remaining relegation places but can still secure survival from the drop. In March, Kevin Keehan resigned as manager of the Lewes having taken over from Steve King in April 2008.

Lewes, who did not play on Tuesday, won promotion to the Blue Square Premier last year but go straight back down to the Blue Square South division after a disappointing season. This week should also see a decision made on the club's future with the deadline looming for points being deducted this season should the club decide to go into administration. The board are currently considering a number of options with a view to resolving the club's difficult financial situation.

Senna tested with Honda last year but missed out on a drive with Brawn
Brazil's Bruno Senna, nephew of the late triple world champion Ayrton, will make his Formula 1 race debut with new team Campos Meta next season. The 26-year-old had said he was talking with the Spanish team at the Brazilian Grand Prix a fortnight ago. He also spoke to other new teams Lotus and Manor GP, plus one existing outfit. "It is an extraordinary honour to return the name of Senna to Formula 1," said delighted Campos Meta chief executive Rodriguez de Castro. "The deal with Senna confirms and re-enforces our prime objective of being not only the first Spanish Formula 1 team, but rather the first Iberian-American F1 team." Senna said: "I'm absolutely delighted to fulfill a lifetime dream. Now it is time to set new targets." He finished as runner-up in the 2008 GP2 feeder series and tested with Honda last November before the Japanese manufacturer pulled out of F1 at the end of the year. 606: DEBATE
Yup, Bruno has landed himself a drive with one of the new teams, Campos
wucash (U14058762)
When the team was rescued by team principal Ross Brawn, he opted to retain the experienced duo of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello at the expense of the promising Senna. But two weeks ago, at Interlagos, Senna said: "I'm looking for a team that has the potential to deliver results and consistency. "It's vital to be in Formula 1 next year as maybe it will be lost if it doesn't happen then." Senna, who is the son of Ayrton Senna's sister, Viviane Lalli, is driving in the Le Mans sportscar series this season. He had ruled out a move to the new Lotus F1 team for sentimental reasons alone. It was with Lotus that Ayrton claimed his first pole position and victory in 1985. The three-time champion, revered as one of the greatest Formula 1 drivers of all time, died when he crashed his Williams in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at Imola.

Fall injuries end eventer Townend's Grand Slam hopes
Two other riders also fell at the same fence as Townend
Oliver Townend's hopes of winning eventing's £230,000 Rolex Grand Slam are over after injuries forced him out of the Kentucky cross-country event.Cracks to his collarbone, chest bone and ribs after Saturday's fall ruled Townend out of Sunday's show jumping. In his absence, William Fox-Pitt became only the second Britain to win the Rolex Kentucky. Riding Cool Mountain, he led throughout from his dressage test and won by 4.9 points from American Philip Dutton. Twice an Olympic team medallist and multi-European Championship medal winner, Fox-Pitt picked up £50,000 for winning the event. Dutton, the 2008 Kentucky champion, finished second with Woodburn, while fellow American Becky Holder on Courageous Comet was third.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Fox-Pitt's previous best Kentucky finishes had been third in 2003 and two fourth-placed results. Townend's crashing fall from Ashdale Cruise Master during Saturday's cross-country at fence 20, where two other riders also fell, means he is set to miss out on defending the Badminton title he won last year, with that event due to begin on Friday. "I feel a bit bashed and bruised, but my spirits are good," said the 27-year-old Yorkshireman. "I will fly home and hopefully get a good rest on the plane. At least the trip home should be easier than the journey here." Townend had gone to Kentucky aiming to win one of equestrian sport's most coveted prizes, a six-figure jackpot for winning three consecutive four-star titles. Having already won at Badminton and Burghley in 2009, Townend had the chance to become the first man to equal British rider Pippa Funnell's unprecedented Grand Slam of 2003. And he had endured a 51-hour roundabout journey to reach Kentucky in pursuit of his third win due to the travel chaos caused by the volcanic ash cloud. "I want to get well quickly and start riding again as soon as possible. It's a tough sport and these things happen," he added. "I was very fit going into Kentucky, and the physical strengthening work I did helped me take such a hard fall without serious damage. "I have to be grateful for my inflatable air bag jacket and riding hat. They both saved me from suffering more serious injuries."
