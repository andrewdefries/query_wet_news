Gay rights activist Milk honoured
Milk was assassinated in 1978, less than a year after his election
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed into law a bill that establishes a day recognising US gay rights leader Harvey Milk.Harvey Milk Day will be marked in California on 22 May, Milk's birthday. The activist was assassinated in 1978. Mr Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year. In the interim, Milk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and was the subject of a film for which actor Sean Penn won an Oscar. Milk was a leader in the gay rights movement and was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977. According to the new law, he was the first openly gay man elected to public office in a major public city. He was assassinated in November 1978, after 11 months in the role. Sean Penn's portrayal of Harvey Milk earned him an Oscar
Vetoing the previous bill in 2008, Mr Schwarzenegger said that Milk should be honoured locally by those to whom he made the greatest difference. The governor's spokesman, Aaron McLear, told Associated Press on Monday that the publicity Milk and his work had received over the past year had been a factor in his change of view. "That made the difference from last year: he's really come to symbolise the gay community in California," he said. The day will not be a state holiday but will be marked by public schools.

Iraq war 'can still be averted'
Mr Blix and Mr El Baradei: Tough new mandate
The United Nations chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix says he is confident war against Iraq can "still be averted".
He was speaking in Cyprus after two days of talks in Baghdad which he described as constructive.
Key dates
8 Dec: Iraq must reveal all programmes, plants and materials which could be used for weapons production
27 Nov: Inspections expected to resume
26 Jan: First inspectors report to UN Security Council expected Click here for the detailed timetable Mr Blix said he and his advance team of inspectors had been promised full co-operation by the Iraqi Government, but added that the verbal commitment "has to be translated on the ground".
Mr Blix earlier said Iraq still needs to prove it has no weapons of mass destruction and urged it to re-examine its weapons stocks. Iraq's position that it has no weapons of mass destruction "must be convincingly shown by documentation, by evidence," Mr Blix said. "We don't think that has yet been
convincingly done."
US President George W Bush has insisted that Iraq must co-operate with the inspectors in order to avoid American military action.
Speaking in Prague, where he is attending a Nato summit, Mr Bush urged members of the alliance to unite against Iraq should the need arise. UN deadline
Mohamed El Baradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said he and Mr Blix had impressed on the Iraqis that they wanted an "accurate and complete report" on 8 December, the deadline set under the UN resolution for Baghdad to declare what weapons it has.

"They assured us they will do everything possible to make sure the declaration would cover all activities," Mr Blix said.
We had good discussions with representatives of the Iraqi Government... they assured us they will fully implement the resolution and co-operate with us
Hans Blix
General Amir al-Saadi, a senior adviser to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, said: "Within 30 days, as the resolution says, a report from Iraq will be submitted on all the files - nuclear, chemical, biological and missile." Inspections
Mr Blix and Mr El Baradei held talks with General al-Saadi, Iraqi chief liaison officer Brigadier Hossam Amin and Foreign Minister Naji Sabri.
Mr Blix and Mr El Baradei are part of a 27-member team of technical specialists who are expected to lay the groundwork for full inspections to begin by 27 November.
Most of the team stayed in Baghdad on Wednesday and additional inspectors will arrive in the Iraqi capital next Monday.
In another development, US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld took issue with United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan over Iraq. Mr Annan told reporters in Kosovo on Tuesday that he did not think the UN Security Council would see it as a breach of the new resolution if Baghdad were to continue firing on US and British planes patrolling the no-fly zones over Iraq.
The arms inspectors arrived in Iraq on Monday
But Mr Rumsfeld said Mr Annan did not necessarily represent "the centre of gravity of the Security Council, on any particular issue at any particular time".
And he said the United States would certainly not allow its aircraft to be shot at with impunity. Allied warplanes patrolling the zones in northern and southern Iraq bombed Iraqi air defences on Monday.
US Central Command said the raids came after Iraqi forces fired at allied aircraft.
The US appears to be alone among the 15 member states of the Security Council in insisting that the no-fly zones are included in the resolution.

1983: Beirut blasts kill US and French troops
At least 146 American marines and 27 French servicemen have been killed after two separate bomb attacks on military headquarters in the Lebanese capital Beirut.
Two lorries containing 4000lb (1.4 tonnes) bombs exploded when they hit the buildings, the US Battalion Landing Team headquarters and the French paratroopers base which are situated just four miles (6km) apart.
The death toll is expected to rise to more than 200 as people remain trapped inside the collapsed buildings.
The two suicide bombers, both of whom died in the attack, have been named as Abu Mazen, 26, and Abu Sijaan, 24. They are reported to be members of a previously unknown group called the Free Islamic Revolutionary Movement.
The group is thought to be made up of Lebanese Shia Muslims and is part of an extremist faction of the Amal militia based in Syrian-occupied eastern Lebanon. The US Secretary of Defence, Caspar Weinberger, insisted there was "strong circumstantial evidence" that Iran was behind the attacks but did not rule out possible Syrian and Soviet involvement.
There are no words that can properly express our outrage and, I think the outrage of all Americans at this despicable act
President Reagan
He also reiterated President Reagan's vow that the US would not remove its troops from Beirut.
"Our goal in Lebanon remains the same and our commitment remains unchanged despite this terrible tragedy," he said.
The National Security Council of the US are due to meet to make a decision on what action is necessary.
President Reagan has condemned the attacks saying: "There are no words that can properly express our outrage and, I think the outrage of all Americans at this despicable act."
US forces have been in Lebanon since August 1982 to act as a peacekeeping force between warring Christian and Muslim factions.
On 12 October this year the Multinational Force in Lebanon resolution was signed to allow US, French and Italian troops to remain in Beirut and help oversee the reconciliation process in the area.

Midfielder Carr joins Morecambe
Carr made 93 appearances for Northwich (Getty)
Morecambe have signed midfielder Michael Carr on a two-year deal from Northwich Victoria.
The 24-year-old is manager Sammy McIlroy's first signing of the summer.
"There were a few clubs that showed an interest in me but the fact that Sammy McIlroy is here really sold it to me," said Carr.
"I am hoping to show I can play at this level. I like to think of myself as a box-to-box player who can chip in with goals as well," he added.
The former Macclesfield player spent four years at Northwich, playing for the England Game XI in his time at Victoria Stadium.
But he picked up an unwanted record during his Macclesfield debut against Darlington when he was booked after 32 seconds before being sent off.
Carr paid tribute to McIlroy's coaching skills and feels he is the man to develop his own game.
"I only scored two last year but in the two years before that scored 29 goals so I am hoping to recapture that type of form as well.''
