German soldiers 'not affected' by DU
German soldiers 'safer' than local people
A study commissioned by the German Ministry of Defence has shown that soldiers deployed in the Balkans were not affected by exposure to depleted uranium (DU).
The GSF research centre for environment and health tested 121 German soldiers before and during their deployment with K-For troops in Kosovo.
"All measurements of uranium were around levels we would expect from groups which have not been exposed," said radiation expert Paul Roth.
Researchers warned, however, that the local population could face a potential health risk of chemical and toxic effects which derive from the heavy metal properties of DU.
Germany has demanded a moratorium on the use of DU weapons until further research has been carried out.
Depleted uranium has been blamed for a number of leukaemia cases among former peacekeepers.
'No link'
Six cases of blood-related illness have been registered by German soldiers returning from the Balkans.
Researchers say a link between the illnesses and DU cannot be made as, given the numbers of troops deployed, between seven and 10 cases are statistically to be expected.
A researcher tests for the effects of DU
The study tested urine samples from 121 German soldiers as well as a population of 200 non-exposed people from various regions of Germany.
In addition 50 aid workers, OSCE police officers and members of the local population were tested.
While no link between DU and illness in soldiers was found, the study said that action should be taken to prevent a potential danger to the local population, particularly children, who may play in areas where DU weapons exploded, releasing toxic chemicals.
The World Health Organisation also said on Friday that a link between leukaemia and DU was "unlikely", but that targeted areas should be cordoned off due to "remaining uncertainties".
DU moratorium
The research has led to suggestions that the German defence minister, Rudolf Scharping was "overly defensive" in calling for a moratorium on the use of DU weapons.
But on Friday, Norway and Finland declared their support for the temporary ban.
Nato aircraft fired tens of thousands of DU rounds during its 1995 bombing of Bosnian Serb targets and 1999 air war against Yugoslavia.
DU rounds are denser than standard ammunition, making them more effective against armour, but the dust given off on impact can be dangerous.
On Wednesday, Nato announced a range of measures to try to allay concerns over DU munitions. Its Secretary-General, Lord Robertson, insists that fears are misplaced and says there will be no suspension of the use of the weapons.
For their part, Yugoslav experts have said they have found radioactivity levels more than 1,000 times greater than usual in Serbia and Montenegro.
Six Italian soldiers, five Belgians, two Dutch nationals, two Spaniards, a Portuguese and a Czech national have died after serving in the Balkans. Four French soldiers and five Belgians have also contracted leukaemia.
However, Russia says initial screening has found no illness among its soldiers who served in the Balkans. Special report

Vatican's UN status questioned
Aid agencies have called the Vatican "indifferent to human suffering"
Family planning organisations caring for Kosovan rape victims are calling for the Vatican's status at the United Nations to be reviewed. The two sides in the debate discuss their differences on the Today programmeAt the heart of the row is the supply of emergency contraception to refugee women who say they have been raped by Serbian troops.
The Vatican has said that the issuing of the "morning-after pills" to Kosovan refugee women by international aid agencies is a form of abortion. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), and other family planning organisations, have condemned the Vatican's attitude, saying it amounts to indifference to suffering. As a result, they want the Vatican's observer status at the UN looked into. Integrated healthcare
Offering emergency contraception to Kosovan women who have been raped is not an automatic response of aid agencies.
Helping rape victims is part of a wider aid programmeIt is made accessible only as part of an overall programme of healthcare. Nonetheless, the IPPF says that the women are glad to have the choice. "Women would at least like to be advised whether they have the possibility to prevent a pregnancy from developing. We know that these women are desperate to be advised about what they can do," said Ingar Brueggemann, Director-General of the IPPF.
The emergency contraceptive is only effective if taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse. The Catholic Church has said that so soon after an attack a rape victim is too traumatised to make a decision.
"A woman in that condition has been violated physically, psychologically and emotionally. If you are in a state of emotional pandemonium, you are not in a position to be making a fair and informed consent," said Nicholas Coote of the Catholic Bishops' Conference in Britain.
Instead, he said, offering victims counselling and medical care was a more appropriate form of assistance. Status review
The IPPF, and other aid organisations, feel that this is such an important issue that the status of the Vatican within the UN should be looked at. The UN's debating chamber at its headquarters in New York"There is a movement to ask for the Vatican's position as a state within the UN to be reviewed. No one would deny that it should have a status as many of the other religious organisations have within the UN but as a non-governmental organisation," said Mrs Brueggemann.
Holding observer status within the UN means that, although the Vatican can be present at UN meetings, it does not have the power to vote.
The Catholic Church has said that the aid agencies are looking to have this status reviewed, or removed, simply because they object to its stance on birth control. The row comes as tensions build over family planning policy in the run up to a major UN conference next month. The Vatican has encouraged developing nations to divert family planning aid budgets into general development aid budgets. Donor nations like the UK oppose this move. World population will hit six billion this year and is projected to rise to nine billion.

American Nightmare
By Sam Benstead
Producer, This World
The crisis in US subprime mortgages has fallen hard on the city of Cleveland, Ohio, where as many as one in six households have been affected.
Eleanor Hall is facing homelessness after taking out a mortgage
Eleanor Hall is a single mother with two children and has a steady job as a market researcher. Five years ago she bought a house which she has lovingly restored. What she didn't realise was that her mortgage was a subprime - a home loan designed for people with a low income or bad credit. They cost more than ordinary mortgages to cover the risk of the banks making the loan. Now, she is unable to pay and left facing homelessness. "I'm truly at rock bottom," she says, "and I have nowhere else to go". Eleanor is not alone - over two million families are expected to lose their homes in the US within the next couple of years. The eviction sheriffs
Evictions have affected one in six Cleveland households since 2000
In Cleveland the cost of clearing the human debris come eviction day falls to the Cuyahoga County Sheriff Department. "I feel like an undertaker," says Jeff, a veteran of neighbourhood policing who has seen evictions in his section jump since he joined the force from 12 a week to over 90 a week. He has to evict families, old people and even, on occasion, his own relatives.
The result is a city blighted by house repossessions - with one in six households in Cleveland have faced eviction proceedings since 2000. Due to a glut of houses on the property market, house prices have crashed. Banks can no longer sell the properties on and they are left derelict and deserted. "It has ripped the heart out of our neighbourhood," says Toni Brancatelli, a lifelong Cleveland resident. He has seen gangs and squatters move in to the empty homes, fuelling crime and social decay. The majority of those defaulting on their mortgages are people living on the poverty line, tipped into defaulting on their mortgage by rising medical bills, unemployment, utility bills and one of the most contentious elements to this crisis - 'predatory lending'.
The Wild West of lending
So who is to blame - the borrower, the broker or the lender? Clearly, it is partly the system itself. US subprime lenders were not required to perform stringent checks on borrower's credit ratings. The result is "ninjas" - loans sold to people with "no income, no job and no assets". "This was the Wild West of lending but there was no sheriff in town," says Jim Rokakis, County Treasurer for the Cleveland area. He has been asking for anti-predatory lending legislation to be passed in Ohio County for years but claims that no-one would listen. Now he is incandescent with anger. "There has been blood flowing on the streets of Cleveland but nobody cared. The only time anyone listened was when blood flowed on the only street that matters in this country, and that's Wall Street". 'The smoking gun'
The subprime mortgages, taken out by people in Cleveland and all over the US, have since been sold on to investors all over the world. Everyone in the system - the brokers, the lenders, the investment appraisers - took their cut and the returns were good. But, as it turns out, so were the risks. "We found the smoking gun, and everyone's fingerprints were on it," says Mark Seifert, director of ESOP, a local poverty action group.
When the mortgages went bad, the securities became worthless and the money dried up on the markets. The result is a global credit crunch, which has been felt in Britain through the bank run on Northern Rock. Although the markets may yet correct themselves, for the people of Cleveland the damage has already been done. "I don't ever see myself owning a home again," says Eleanor Hall. She, like millions of other subprime mortgage borrowers in America, bought into the American dream of owning your own home, only for that dream to become a nightmare. This World: American Nightmare will be broadcast on Monday 29 October 2007 at 1900 GMT on BBC Two. E-mail this to a friend

Animals affected by cold weather
Cold weather froze troughs and water supply pipes
Livestock and rare birds have been affected by snow and cold weather in Devon and Cornwall, animal groups and farmers say.The weather has meant farmers dealing with frozen troughs and supply pipes to ensure animals got fresh water. The RSPB said some rare birds reintroduced to the counties were at risk, including cirl buntings. The bird charity said it was asking members of the public and farmers to put out food and water for them. Temperatures plunged to -9C (16F) in parts of Devon and Cornwall on Monday night and were expected to reach -6C (21F) by Wednesday morning. They may starve in this weather
Peter Exley, RSPB
Extra checks have had to be carried out on farms to ensure livestock are well. They have included ensuring water gets to animals by breaking ice on troughs and either clearing water pipes or transporting water by other means. Devon farmer Rob Taverner said: "The water that normally serves the chickens has completely frozen. "We're having to get buckets and go to the river to get some fresh running water so the chickens get exactly what they need to lay eggs." Rare birds which could be affected by the weather include cirl buntings, which were reintroduced to parts of Devon and Cornwall in 2006. Peter Exley, from the RSPB, said: "They may starve in this weather and that's why we're implementing emergency feeding. "We're asking volunteers and famers to put food out for the birds so they can survive this spell."

Chelsea need stability - Ballack
By Chris Bevan
BBC Sport at Wembley
Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack has agreed a one-year contract extension and expects AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti to arrive at Stamford Bridge.Speaking after Chelsea's FA Cup final win over Everton, Ballack told BBC Sport: "I haven't signed yet but I have agreed for another year." Ancelotti is the favourite to succeed Guus Hiddink, who stepped down after his side's Wembley victory. Ballack, 32, added: "It's not done yet but it looks like he will be coach." The former Reggiana, Parma and Juventus boss announced he was leaving the San Siro after they played their final Serie A game on Sunday.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Chelsea need a replacement for Hiddink, who is returning to his job as Russia coach after capping a successive four-month stint with the Blues by winning at Wembley on Saturday. They have been in talks with Ancelotti and Ballack feels the 49-year-old Italian would be the right man to take charge, adding: "I haven't worked under him and I don't know him very well but you can see from the work he has done at Milan that he is a successful manager." Ballack, who is captain of Germany, joined Chelsea from Bayern Munich in May 2006 and would have been a free agent this summer. He has won two FA Cups in his time with the Blues but bigger prizes have eluded him and he believes he has unfinished business in west London. "You always want to win something you haven't won," added Ballack. "Next year, the focus like always will be on the Premier League and the Champions League."

Ancelotti's appointment has the feel of a Scolari-style punt

Whether or not Ancelotti does take charge, Ballack will be playing under his fifth manager during his spell at Chelsea by the time next season gets under way. He was signed by Jose Mourinho and Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari and now Hiddink have all come and gone since then. In the meantime, Manchester United have won the League three times and Ballack believes it is obvious what his side have been lacking. "What we need at Chelsea is consistency," he explained. "There is not much that we need to change to win the Premier League next season. We have a great team, which is the most important thing, but we have to change the manager again and we will need a bit of time to adapt.
Ballack says Ancelotti is a successful coach
"It is not always like under it was under Guus where somebody comes in and the team starts winning straight away - that is not normal. "Every coach works with different methods and the players have to get to know him - hopefully we won't need too much time because if we do we will be a little bit behind." Despite the enforced upheaval, Ballack remains confident his side are capable of stopping United and insists he and his team-mates also have the hunger to regain the title they last won in 2006. "Next year we want to win it again," said Ballack. "We know that United are a very very good team, and they have a good year behind them so it will not be easy. "They have won it three years in a row which is a big thing, they can play with confidence and it looks like it is getting easier for them. "But we have showed this season, especially in the Champions League, that we can play really good football too. "I don't think we need to buy anybody because we already have a lot of good players on the bench. "That is for the club to decide but, if you look at the performances over the last couple of years in reaching finals, we have a really good squad and are heading in the right direction." Ballack dedicated his side's Wembley victory to Hiddink, who has transformed the club in his brief spell in charge, and says the Dutchman played a key role in their success in his final game. "He was really relaxed," revealed Ballack. "He was enjoying the day and even when we were 1-0 down you could see he was really confident in us because he knows how we can play. "Even when we were behind, nobody thought about defeat because he believed in us so much - it has been been a big pleasure to work with him." Ballack's team-mate Ashley Cole was also pleased Hiddink, 62, was able to secure some silverware before leaving the club. The England left-back, who was voted man-of-the-match for his performance in the final, said: "Everyone spoke about it before the game, we wanted to send him off with something, we thought he deserved it. "We are going to miss him, today was about him and we are just happy he has signed off with a trophy. "He did a great job, got respect from all the players, the staff and the fans and I think everyone was on his side, which helped." The former Arsenal defender became only the fourth player to win the Cup on five occasions, and the first since 1891. But the 28-year-old will not be satisfied unless Chelsea can challenge for the League and Champions League next season, adding: "Next year we have to do better than just winning the FA Cup. "Guus will be a hard act to follow but I think, whoever comes in as manager next, we have to treat him exactly the same and show the passion that is here to win a bigger trophy next year."

The action as it happened
Photos from Queen's
Ian Flanagan and Jonathan Marray both had their fairytale runs ended by seeded players at Queen's.
Flanagan, who had earlier beaten Mark Philippoussis, was thrashed by fifth seed Sebastien Grosjean 6-2 6-0.
But Marray pushed sixth seed Lleyton Hewitt to the limit before succumbing 7-6 (7/2) 7-6 (10/8).
Marray forced six set-points in the 12th game of the first set, and saved four match-points along the way, but Hewitt proved just too strong.
"I'm a bit disappointed I didn't take it to three [sets]," Marray told the BBC, "but I had a great time and it was a great atmosphere.
"I felt a little nervous before but once I got out there I really enjoyed it.
In the end I just played the bigger points better in the tie-break
Lleyton Hewitt
"I stuck to my gameplan and I think I caused him a few problems so I'm pretty happy."
Hewitt was fulsome in his praise for the young Briton.
"He played extremely well - he served extremely well for the whole match," said Hewitt. "In the end I just played the bigger points better in the tie-break.
"He obviously enjoys coming to the net and he played a lot of good low volleys."
Flanagan, ranked 886th in the world, was unable to produce the kind of display that had seen him beat Philippoussis and Victor Hanescu.
Grosjean was simply too consistent from the baseline, breaking five times to seal a comfortable win in just 50 minutes.
Playing his first match on the Centre Court at Queen's, Flanagan admitted he had been some way short of his best form.
It's been a great week and hopefully I'll be back here next year
Ian Flanagan
"The atmosphere was great and the fans have been superb, it's just a shame I couldn't give them something to cheer," he said.
"Grosjean is just the type of person you don't want to play when you're a little bit nervous.
"The one thing you don't want is someone making every single ball and putting you under pressure and unfortunately I didn't play anywhere near my best tennis.
"But it's been a great week and hopefully I'll be back here next year."
Flanagan said he was still hopeful of receiving a wildcard for Wimbledon.
"I think I deserve a wildcard but it's out of my hands," he said.
Flanagan waits on wildcard
He falls outside the LTA's selection criteria for wildcards, but the All England Club has three more to be handed out at its discretion.
