Drought sucks life from Argentina's farms
A lone cow crosses the dry bed of the once-mighty Salado river By Candace Piette
BBC News, Buenos Aires
A deflated bag of bones, the carcass of a bull, lies dried out on the banks of a river, baked by the sun. Normally green, the prime pastureland around lies silent and dry.
This is San Miguel del Monte, a little over 100km (60 miles) south of Buenos Aires, in the Argentine pampas, the vast grasslands that roll out like an inner sea across thousands of kilometres.
The Salado river, which supplies the local ranches, is now a small stream. Large carp leap desperately in the shallows, trying to find deeper water.
A long-running drought, the worst in 50 years, has exacted a heavy toll and even a brief break in the weather in some areas was unlikely to alleviate the situation.
Cattle ranching has a long history in Argentina and about half the country is used for agriculture.
After the rains dried up in March last year, 800,000 head of cattle have died
The country's wealth was built on beef, and Argentines are avid meat-eaters, consuming an astounding average of 70kg (154lb) of beef per person per year.
Cesar Gioia has been ranching in the Salado basin for 25 years. He rides a white stallion and is at ease in the saddle as he monitors his herd of 500 cows and bullocks.
"Look, these cows are emaciated. They should be capable of four or five births, but I will need to sell them because there is no pasture. They won't be able to reproduce because they are too thin," he says.
"If I have to pay for food for them I won't make any profit. They will have to go for corned beef because they are in such bad condition," he adds.
Mr Goia's frustration is clear - he is being forced to slaughter the cows that should have generated next year's herds.
This pattern has been repeated all over the country for two years running.
In the first 10 months of last year, 280,000 more cows than the year before were sent to slaughter.
Unviable industry
Even before the drought, Argentine beef was in crisis.
Our government has an uncontrolled resentment against everything that is farmers and agriculture in general
Jonny Cahers D'AnversArgentine rancher
The left-wing government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has put a limit on how much beef can be sold abroad, where it fetches higher prices.
The intention was to keep domestic prices low for the Argentine public. But the policy damaged foreign trade.
From being the third-largest beef exporter in the world five years ago, Argentina has now dropped to seventh.
Ranchers say their industry is becoming increasingly unviable under the rules.
Last year, the government had to back down after a series of strikes and demonstrations by producers over the export cap for beef and also high export taxes for other agricultural products.
Jonny Cahers D'Anvers comes from seven generations of ranchers. He sold all his cattle because he was making so little money.
"Our government has an uncontrolled resentment against everything that is farmers and agriculture in general," he says.
"They are now artificially using us to provide cheap food for the Argentines. The problem with this is that it is very short term."
For her part, President Fernandez has repeated many times that she is not prepared to offer a complete moratorium on taxes for agriculture.
In reference to the prosperous farming community in a recent radio interview, she said she expected the wealthiest in the land to do their bit to help redistribute income and support Argentina at a time of economic crisis.
Deep recession
Other factors too have led to the decline in the cattle business.
Many ranchers turned to cereal production, particularly soya, which the government encouraged after Argentina's 2001 economic crisis, as a way to bring in more export revenues.
Economist Jose Luis Espert says the drought is a severe blow for the already suffering agriculture sector.
"Because of the drought, GDP for agriculture will decline 5% this year, and in exports Argentina will lose $15bn (�10.5bn)."
Argentina's once-fertile pampas are withering
All the industries dependent on agriculture in Argentina are forecast to suffer job losses amid factors including declining production, demand and revenues.
The global economic slowdown has already hit hard, with exports of Argentine soya down 40% this year due to falling demand.
By contrast, wheat has been so badly hit by the drought that Argentina's biggest client, Brazil, is planning to buy from other countries because Argentina cannot supply enough.
For cattle ranching, the future looks particularly bleak, says rancher Cesar Gioia.
"I think cattle ranching could recuperate in five years, if all these adverse effects are reversed. But if not...we won't be able to recover and, unfortunately, I think Argentina will have to import meat in 2010."
For Argentine proud of their beef, this is almost too shocking to contemplate.
More than anything, it is a huge indicator of the extent to which the combined blows of internal crisis, falling exports, and drought seem to be conspiring to bring on yet another deep recession.

Bank cuts interest rate to 4.5%
UK interest rates have been cut to 4.5% by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).
The MPC's decision at its 100th meeting had been widely expected. UK rates had been held at 4.75% since August 2004. Experts had predicted the move in the face of concerns about slowing UK growth and consumer spending, and manufacturing moving into recession.
Business leaders said the Bank had made "the right decision" amid mounting evidence of a UK slowdown.
Easing the pressure
"This cut will be a catalyst for growth and will provide an essential boost to consumer and business confidence," Digby Jones, head of the Confederation of British Industry, said.
But the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) called on the MPC to remain vigilant, warning that "the UK economic climate has worsened and we are facing new dangers".
This cut is a timely and proportionate response to an economic situation which is now flashing amber
Steve Radley, EEF
Your reaction to the rate cut
The UK economy has grown below trend for four successive quarters - its worst performance in more than a decade.
A slowdown on the High Street has put the brakes on growth, with year-on-year growth in the second quarter at 1.7% - its weakest rate since the first three months of 1993. Cut 'timely'
The British Retail Consortium (BRC) added that the decision had been long overdue, but warned the change would take several months to feed through to the High Street.
"The cut... needs to be reinforced by further reductions over the next few months if the economy continues to slow down," BRC chief Kevin Hawkins warned.
INTEREST RATE GUIDE
How will the rate cut affect your mortgage and savings?
In detail
Manufacturing organisation the EEF said the move would give the Bank "breathing space" to assess the economy throughout the autumn.
"This cut is a timely and proportionate response to an economic situation which is now flashing amber and will reassure manufacturers that the Bank is prepared to take calm and measured action," said EEF chief economist Steve Radley.
However, the T&G union condemned the move as "too little, too late" saying that UK rates still remain double that of competitors in Europe, leaving UK companies at a disadvantage.
Good news, bad news
The cut is also good news for mortgage holders. The Halifax dropped its standard variable rate to 6.5% immediately after the news - leaving customers with an average mortgage of �80,000 �12 better off a month.
On the downside, savers will not get as good a return. ING had already cut its interest rate from 5% to 4.75%on one of its savings products ahead of the Bank's move.
Looking ahead, analysts suggested the Bank could cut rates once more this year, but they warned that a rapid series of cuts would be unlikely due to the risk of re-igniting inflationary pressures.
Edward Menashy of brokers Charles Stanley suggested the MPC could make its move in November - a date that would coincide with the Bank's next quarterly inflation report.
Consumer price inflation hit 2% - the Treasury's target - in June and the Bank of England will be wary of pushing it any higher.
The Bank is also keen to keep a lid on consumer debt and does not want to undo its efforts to control the UK housing market. E-mail this to a friend

NHS 'let down' over care claims
There were more than 11,000 requests for cases to be reviewed
More support should have been given to NHS bodies to help them clear a backlog of care compensation claims, a health watchdog has said.
Local health bodies faced a flood of claims after the Health Service Ombudsman last year found many had wrongly judged who should pay for care.
Pledges to review all cases by December 2003, then by March 2004, were missed.
In her annual report, Ann Abraham said a lack of support from the Department of Health was to blame.
Continuing care or long-term care describes the care that people of all ages may need over an extended period of time because of a disability, accident or illness.
What the Department provided was clearly inadequate to the task
Ms Ann Abraham, Health Service Ombudsman
The Department of Health ordered a review last year after the ombudsman said some people needing long-term care, such as the elderly, disabled and people with chronic illnesses, had been unjustly denied financial support.
NHS organisations up and down the country were asked to review the care criteria used since 1996 to identify any patients in their area who may have been wrongly made to pay for their care in a home. There were more than 11,700 requests for cases to be reviewed by strategic health authorities and primary care trusts across England.
Backlog
The original pledge to resolve the complaints by the end of the year was moved to March of this year because only 57% of the reviews had been completed.
Ms Abraham said the number of complaints she received this year had increased by 18% to 4,700 and most of these had been concerns about long-term care.
Ms Abrahams said: "Despite my warning last summer that there were likely to be large numbers of people affected by these issues and that the Department of Health would need to provide adequate support and guidance, it would appear they have not done so. "Cases for retrospective review totalled over 11,000 and the deadline for completion of these has been moved twice. "What the Department provided was clearly inadequate to the task," she said.
Health Minister Stephen Ladyman said: "At the time the March deadline was set, about 6,000 cases were outstanding. "Continuing publicity, including the Ombudsman's own interest, subsequently generated around another 6,000 cases - so although 6,000 cases were reviewed by the end of March there remained another 6,000 cases to complete. "We are seeking to complete these by the end of July and thereafter cases will be reviewed in two months from submission of all paperwork," he said.
On track
A Department of Health spokeswoman added: "We are alerting the NHS to the publication of this report, emphasising the key messages and encouraging its use both in service development and training for all staff."
She said they were on track to review the cases by the end of July.
She said the timings were not deadlines and that anyone putting forward a case after that date would have it reviewed. "It's important that people who feel they should be recompensed are given the opportunity to approach their SHA and put in a claim and have their case reviewed," she said.
Andrea Lane, senior press officer for Help the Aged said: "At long last, compensation is starting to trickle through to the thousands of older people who have been wrongly charged for care. "This process has taken far to long and the Ombudsman is correct to criticise the 'slow progress' and 'disappointing performance'.
"However, older people, their families and friends still face a snake pit of confusion when trying to establish who pays for what care and when. This has to be corrected. We need to simplify the system by providing free personal and nursing as is done in Scotland."

Nobel prize for viral discoveries
HIV infects the immune system's T- lymphocytes
The scientists who discovered HIV will share the Nobel prize for medicine with the expert who linked human papilloma virus (HPV) to cervical cancer.
French team Fran�oise Barr�-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier were recognised for their groundbreaking work in uncovering the virus responsible for Aids.
Harald zur Hausen, from Germany, received the prize for making the link between HPV and cervical cancer.
More than 25 million people have died of HIV/Aids since 1981.
Never before have science and medicine been so quick to discover, identify the origin and provide treatment for a new disease entity
The Nobel Assembly about the discovery of HIV
Globally, more than 33 million people are living with HIV.
Following medical reports of a new immunodeficiency syndrome in 1981, Professor Barre-Sinoussi, of the Institut Pasteur, and Dr Montagnier, director of the World Foundation for AIDS Research and Prevention, were the first to identify HIV as the culprit.
In its citation, the Nobel Assembly said their discovery was vital in enabling scientists to begin to understand the biology of a virus which continued to pose a huge public health threat throughout the globe.
Major advances
Their work led to the development of methods to diagnose infected patients and to screen blood products, which has limited the spread of the pandemic.
It has also led to new treatments.
The availability of a vaccine against HPV is now a reality thanks to the original discovery of the virus by Harald zur Hausen
Dr Adriano BoassoImperial College
There is still no cure for HIV. However, for many the disease is no longer an imminent death sentence thanks to the major advances in research and drug development over recent years.
With treatment, people with HIV can live for decades with the condition.
However, HIV medicines are not widely available in many poor countries around the world.
The citation said: "Never before have science and medicine been so quick to discover, identify the origin and provide treatment for a new disease entity.
"Successful anti-retroviral therapy results in life expectancies for persons with HIV infection now reaching levels similar to those of uninfected people."
Nick Partridge of the HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust said: "Fran�oise Barr�-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier are very deserving winners of the Noble Prize for Medicine.
"Their work was hugely significant, leading to enormous progress in the understanding and treatment of HIV."
Both Dr Montagnier and a US researcher Dr Robert Gallo are co-credited with discovering that HIV causes Aids, although for several years they staked rival claims that led to a legal and even diplomatic dispute between France and America.
The Nobel jury made no mention of Dr Gallo in its citation.
Professor Barr�-Sinoussi said the award was "a great honour that I wasn't expecting."
Vaccines developed
Professor zur Hausen, of the University of Duesseldorf, was praised by the Nobel committee for going "against current dogma" to discover that HPV infection caused cervical cancer.
HPV can be detected in 99.7% of all women with cervical cancer, and persistent infection with the virus is estimated to be responsible for more than 5% of all cancers worldwide.
Professor zur Hausen's work helped others to develop vaccines against HPV, which are now routinely given to millions of teenage girls in many countries to prevent cervical cancer.
Dr Adriano Boasso, research fellow at Imperial College and Wellcome Trust Research Career Development Fellow, said: "Isolating the causing agent of an infectious disease is the single most important step toward developing a vaccine.
"The availability of a vaccine against HPV is now a reality thanks to the original discovery of the virus by Harald zur Hausen.
"HIV vaccine research has instead recently suffered the failure of promising clinical trials, but there is no doubt that the discovery of HIV by Fran�oise Barr�-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier will be the pillar on which an efficient vaccine will eventually be built."
Professor zur Hausen, 72, received half of the prize with Professor Barr�-Sinoussi, 61, and Dr Montagnier, 76, splitting the other half.

How can oil slicks be prevented?
Portugal is likely to bear the brunt of catastrophic pollution as strong winds threaten to push a second oil slick formed around the wreck of the sunken fuel tanker towards its coasts. The leaking oil tanker Prestige completely split apart after enduring a storm a week ago and its cargo sank on Tuesday.
It's unclear if the oil inside the Prestige will escape if the ship breaks up further; experts say the low sea temperature may delay the oil seepage and might even solidify it.
Five thousand tons of oil has already poured into the ocean and is washing up in thick sludges on the Spanish Galicia coast. Wildlife has been badly affected and charges of causing environmental damage and obstructing the rescue effort have been brought against the captain who is said to have refused to co-operate in having the leaking tanker towed out to sea and away from the coast. Fishing has been suspended and the livelihood of entire communities may be ruined.
Should oil tankers be banned from coming close to the coastline? Should tankers be captained differently? This Talking Point was suggested by Mrs Jude Garner, US: "Why hasn't the world put restrictions on the ships that move oil?"

It might be worth exploring the possibility of tankers carrying an oil coagulant, which could be used to solidify bulk oil cargo in the event of catastrophic structural failure.
Interestingly, because oil has a lower specific gravity than sea-water, this tactic would also assist in keeping a damaged vessel afloat. Chris B, England We should have better equipment to control oil spills when they do occur. Stuart T, Netherlands
Why are we not talking about practical solutions? We should have better equipment to control oil spills when they do occur. Because they will happen for many years regardless of new safety measures or other future developments. Why were Oil Booms (floating barriers) not used in this spill? Why don't we create fast reaction teams with such containment and cleanup equipment? They were used in other parts of the world before, why not this time? Stuart T, Netherlands Oil companies are constantly reporting profits that border on the obscene when you consider the environmental devastation that is forced on us by their products. For such cash rich organisations money should be no option in ensuring that these incidents never occur. Under the stones of Alaska, the Exxon Valdez's spilt cargo persists to this day and will for hundreds of years. The damage to ecosystems endures long after the media's eye has turned its attention elsewhere. The damage is irreversible and it's up to the oil conglomerates to ensure this never happens again. Casey Fleming, England A lot of the news coverage about the Spanish oil spill crisis seemed to focus, almost entirely on the Spanish government's refusal to allow the ship to dock on its coast and to infer that one could therefore blame the disaster on Spain. That was totally misleading and added insult to injury.
Not only does Spain have to suffer an ecological and economic disaster, but is blamed for it. When the reality is, is that Spain had nothing to do with the ship or its contents or why it was where it was. They should be getting an apology and compensation from those responsible, not condemnation from its patronising neighbours.
Was the story presented in this way because perhaps Spain is an easier target than the oil companies?

Oil companies should be made to pay for the clean-up operations required as a result of any spillages from their vessels. That would concentrate corporate minds on ensuring their vessels are constructed so as to minimise the risk of spillage (e.g. double skinned, compartmented hulls). Of course, they may decide to get insurance against this (and insurers would no doubt demand the same safeguards against it happening). The present situation where the victim (i.e. the nearest country to an incident) has to pay the price is unfair and wrong. H R Lee, England One answer would be more pipelines across Europe Nick, UK
One answer would be more pipelines across Europe as this decreases vehicle transportation on land thereby benefiting the environment and also lessens the risk of spills. Though it must be put in a slight perspective that oil in the sea is not completely unnatural as it leaks from underground sources to the seas surface. Nick,
UK
Unless the world puts strict restrictions on the ships that move oil, problems like this will never stop. We must insist that only ships that are sturdy and able should be used to move oil. This has to be a fast and true law and adhered to regardless of who owns the ships. No politics are or should ever be involved in the choice of ships, only how sturdy they are. This will stop these terrible oil slicks and the ruining of our seas as well as killing our birds and animals. Mrs. Jude Garner, USA When a tanker is in danger of breaking up it should be taken inshore to a sheltered location, beached and the oil taken off manually, sacrificing a small part of the coastline. Taking the Prestige offshore is exactly what NOT to do, where it will inevitably break up and lose all its oil. Now the oil is going reach a much wider area of coastline, ruining many more beaches, fishing communities and obliterating most sea life. Webbie,
UK
To combat the flag of convenience problem, why not press for the UN to draw up a single code of conduct and take direct control of world shipping? All sailors and vessels would have a single standard, no matter where the ship is registered.
Rhiannon,
UK
All oil companies must be forced to pay for double hull tankers immediately
Dave Tooker,
USA This is proof that the single hull time extensions are a bad idea. All single hull vessels should be banned immediately and oil companies forced to pay for double haul tankers. Just as I am required to pay to meet emission standards on my car all oil companies must be forced to pay for double hull tankers immediately.
Dave Tooker,
USA
British Gibraltar was the destination of oil tanker Prestige. Dozens of ships use Gibraltar waters to avoid environmental safety regulations. Company profits at all costs are not acceptable. Britain should put an end to all this. Pacopadre,
Spain
It is known that the vessel was last near Gibraltar taking fuel in June of this year. Where has this vessel been since then? What ports has she visited? Have any checks been carried out at any of these ports? Do they have evidence that the ship was sailing to Gibraltar? How on earth can Gibraltar be to blame for what happened? Has anyone questioned these Spanish accusations? In fact the Gibraltar and British authorities have evidence that the ship was not even calling at Gibraltar but sailing directly to Singapore. Let's stop this nonsense that is evidently trying to tarnish Gibraltar's reputation at all cost. This makes a mockery of the Spanish authorities as well as the European Commission. Luciano, Gibraltar Sea traffic must be seriously regulated
Ernesto Jardim, Portugal Sea traffic must be seriously regulated. It's not possible any more to leave old vessels with dangerous cargo crossing the seas, most of the time with flags of convenience. It must be stopped! Do we need a terrorist attack on one of these ships to open our eyes to the chaos that are the current sea regulations? Maybe that's the only way to get people's attention, in the security-mad 21st century. Ernesto Jardim, Portugal The only way to eliminate oil slicks is to eliminate the need to transport oil. Invest in development of clean fuels and build more nuclear power stations.
Keith L,
UK
Great idea Keith L - let's have nuclear power instead of using oil!
After all what could be worse than thousands of tons of poisonous, black sticky waste in our seas? Of course - radioactive waste! Why hasn't anyone else thought of this? Andrew, London, UK These events occur with depressing regularity
Sheila Blake,
Vancouver, Canada
As usual the common denominator is profit/greed. The oil companies should not be given a choice. Effective regulations to mitigate such disasters should be drawn up and strictly enforced together with multi-hulled vessels. These events occur with depressing regularity.
Sheila Blake,
Vancouver, Canada
Don't blame the crew, it's the owners, charters and moreover the policy makers who must be held accountable. As long as man's demand for oil remains and the economical pressure to move the oil faster and cheaper prevails, incidents such as these will occur repeatedly. Gurmeet Singh, India Oil spills can't be prevented. Unfortunately, accidents happen and always will. Shawn, USA This was inevitable
David McNeill, UK This was inevitable from the moment the EU allowed single hulled oil tankers to remain in service until 2015. Can you imagine what rust buckets are out there now? The only way to get around this is pure hard cash. Make the owners pay the entire cost, including clean up and damage to livelihoods. If they don't then ban any of their ships from entering EU waters until they pay. The trouble is this sort of ship is registered under a flag of convenience and that's the real scandal. David McNeill, UK Let's not forget that the classification authorities have a role to play in the ship's safety. The Prestige was under the American Bureau of Shipping class having just come out of its annual survey (shipping's MOT). Yet this still happened. We need some answers. Dave Sanderson, UK The oil spill will be absorbed by nature within a year. It is not a disaster as the 'doom merchant environmentalists' are predicting. Far more oil is leaked into the sea from non oil tanker break ups, from the normal use of our petroleum hungry vehicles. This however is causing a real problem. Mike, UK What about using long-distance pipelines more? I'm sure the EU could fund such a project. It would cost less to transport as well. Richard, UK Shipping is the greenest, cheapest and safest form of mass transport. If shipping ceased, the world's economy is predicted to stop in three weeks. 20-30% of a spill evaporates within the first two days and the remainder is degraded on the surface, within the water column and on the bed by significant bacterial decay. Assuming this new slick doesn't hit the coast, recovery will occur within the year.
Tony,
UK
The EU must impose regulations on shipping, paid for by the oil industry
Ted,
UK Write to your MEP now. Torrey Canyon, Amoco Cadiz, Braer, Sea Empress, Prestige... These all too regular disasters should just not be continuing to happen. The EU must impose much tighter regulations on shipping, with mandatory penalties for the owners and operators, and much better enforcement, paid for by the oil industry. Ted,
UK
There are millions of tons of oil safely transported every day around the world. All you hear about is the one the media want you to hear about. They don't report the safe arrival of every ship because it would be uninteresting.
In this example, questions have to be asked of the Spanish for refusing to allow the ship into a port of refuge away from stormy seas. If they had done that then the resulting pollution could have been minimised.
John,
UK
The most dangerous cargoes are carried with the lowest regulation
Ros Whitley,
UK Increasingly the most dangerous cargoes are being carried by the ships with the lowest regulation, Third World crews who often cannot read and shady owners who are little more than criminals. The leading nations should impose, by force if necessary, Western regulations on their ships.
Ros Whitley,
UK
Changing oil tankers crews and routes is not the answer. Changing the design of oil tankers is the only way and any tankers that cannot be modified should be scrapped. If we can build a re-usable spacecraft we can certainly build an oil tanker that will never leak. R.C. Robjohn,
UK
A quadruple hulled ship. Simple. Anon,
UK
As disastrous as this is for fishing communities, all is not lost
Roger Morgan Freedlan,
England Of approx 1,800 oil tankers working the seas at the moment, 1,000 are single hulled. Big business has fought tooth and nail to stop these floating disasters in waiting from being immediately de-commissioned. Having said that, the Exxon Valdes spill was a real environmental eyeopener. The beaches that were left "untreated" apparently healed themselves roughly along the same timeline as "treated" beaches. As disastrous as this is for the Spanish fishing communities, all is not lost. It just takes a little time. I hope that the oil companies will pay these communities well for this.
Roger Morgan Freedlan,
England
How about encouraging the use of bio fuels instead of fuels derived from crude oil, which helps the environment and negates the need to ship crude oil all over the world? The oil would still be needed for plastics etc but all of that can be produced near to where the oil is sourced and then shipped once it's in a more ecologically friendly state. This would revitalise farming in Europe (ridding us of the disastrous Common agricultural policy) and stop mountains of cash flooding into the pockets of totalitarian regimes in the Middle East.
Dave,
UK
Only double-hulled vessels should be allowed to carry oil and other substances that pose a threat to the environment and wildlife.
Paul Driscoll,
England
The oil majors take great care
Andrew,
UK
I work in the oil industry and can assure you that age restrictions on ships are being tightened following the sinking of the Erika three years ago. The oil majors take great care to reduce the risk of accidents and spillages - which can cost billions to clean up and drive down share prices. But independent companies can make money by employing lower standards of seamanship and maintenance, and hiding behind complex chains of ownership and flags of convenience in the event of trouble. This is the problem that needs to be addressed.
Andrew,
UK
Apparently share values are all these people (Andrew, UK) care about? How about the millions of creatures suffocating and starving to death? Until people start to care more about other creatures than about share values and oil prices this sort of thing is inevitable.
Giles Hogben,
UK
Why not accompany tankers with tugs when they are near coastlines? This sort of thing can probably be avoided but it would probably eat into the profits of the oil companies.
Mike,
UK
The problem lies with the shipping owners. To cut costs and bypass more stringent safety requirements, too many corporations opt to register under flags of convenience. It is time the ocean transporting of cargo be brought back under the control of governments who will ensure all safety measures are met. Using inexperienced crews, driven by the companies' greed to get the cargo through at all costs is no longer acceptable. Steve T,

Puttnam's call to 'love' teachers
Lord Puttnam says teachers need love, not bullying
Teachers need to be loved until they feel "10 feet tall", according to Lord Puttnam.
The recently-appointed chairman of the new General Teaching Council (GTC) - the regulatory body for the teaching profession - told MPs it would rectify decades of denigration, aiming to re-build the profession's self-confidence and status.
Lord Puttnam: "Teachers should be showered with respect"
The Oscar-winning film producer drew a parallel between education and the film industry.
"You can't bully people into making good movies," he said. "But you can love them into it, and encourage them, make them feel 10 feet tall.
"Once you do that, they will deliver you the kind of work you expect from people who feel 10 feet tall."
Last year, Lord Puttnam accused Chief Inspector of Schools in England, Chris Woodhead, of conducting a "regime of intimidation and terror" against the profession.
I know Chris Woodhead well. He is perfectly capable of dishing it out. I am sure he is equally capable of taking it
Lord Puttnam On Wednesday, he told the Education Select Committee he expected the
GTC to mirror the "healthy scepticism" with which many teachers viewed the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted).
"I know Chris Woodhead well. He is perfectly capable of dishing it out. I am sure he is equally capable of taking it."
He repeated his call for Ofsted to now do more to encourage the teaching profession, as competent, self-confident teachers were central to Britain's success in the coming century.
Ofsted's rigorous challenge to the quality of education had been necessary.
"But at a certain point someone has to sit down and change, and start showering the teaching profession with the kind of respect and regard they
deserve."
Election candidates
The GTC announced on Tuesday that 208 teachers had put themselves forward for election to its council.
The new body will have 64 members - 24 elected teachers and the rest
appointed by education organisations and the government.
The GTC's Chief Executive, Carol Adams, said it would see its prime role as encouraging
teachers' professional self-development, improving the quality of their work so that its disciplinary role would represent a minority of its work.

Tension builds over Trimble deadline
Tough challenges ahead for political players
Northern Ireland Secretary John Reid is to invite the political parties to meetings aimed at defusing tension over the Ulster Unionists' decision to set a deadline for peace. Party leader David Trimble announced on Saturday that UUP ministers would resign from the Northern Ireland Executive, collapsing the power-sharing government, if republicans had not proved they were committed to peace by 18 January.
The decision was taken at a meeting of his party's ruling council at which hardliners pressed Mr Trimble to adopt a tougher line against Sinn Fein following claims of republican paramilitary activity.
Mr Trimble said his party would also impose the immediate sanction on republicans of ending Ulster Unionist participation in North-South Ministerial Council meetings in which Sinn Fein was involved.
It could be that the people in the IRA move unequivocally into Sinn Fein and devote themselves purely to democratic means
David Trimble He added the Ulster Unionists hoped to get into talks with the British Government and the other political parties over the next three months to "see if there is a viable basis for future government in Northern Ireland".
However, Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness accused the Ulster Unionist party of assaulting the Good Friday Agreement. The Education Minister said many people viewed Jeffrey Donaldson as the real Ulster Unionist leader but warned Mr Donaldson could not ignore Sinn Fein. Meanwhile, the Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley has called for the assembly to be dissolved so elections can be held immediately. Speaking on Sunday, Dr Reid said he could understand the Ulster Unionists' need for reassurance but he called on all those involved in the political process to consider what was at stake.
He told the BBC's On the Record programme there was no reason why IRA decommissioning and the disbanding of the IRA could not be completed by 18 January.
"It could be that the people in the IRA move unequivocally into Sinn Fein and devote themselves purely to democratic means," he said.
Martin McGuinness: Accused the UUP of 'assaulting' the Agreement
Mr Trimble said Sinn Fein should have been preparing the IRA for the "inevitable".
He said: "This process cannot be sustained as things stand at the moment."
Deputy leader of the nationalist SDLP Brid Rodgers condemned the Ulster Unionist threat as "wrong".
"Does he not recognise the difference that the past five years have made to the people of Ireland, north and south," she said. "It is clear now that Mr Trimble has joined the "no-men" who set out from the very beginning to wreck the Agreement. "They didn't support power-sharing and they certainly did not support the principle of equality."
The Irish Government, reacted with dismay to Mr Trimble's announcement of the deadline.
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said the decision of the Ulster Unionist Council was "regrettable and a cause for concern".

�In Pictures:�How to make perfect tea
Bottom down and bottoms upThe finished tea should be a "rich, attractive colour" and be somewhere in the region of 65 degrees centigrade � any hotter and scientists warn that "vulgar slurping" might be required.
Dr Andrew Stapley says: "For best results carry a heavy bag of shopping � or walk the dog � in cold, driving rain for at least half an hour beforehand. This will make the tea taste out of this world."

White Lies 'anxious' about hype
By Greg Cochrane
Newsbeat music reporter
A journey of aspirations, nerves and paranoia: the West London trio release their debut album To Lose My Life next week, but first, a few home truths...
White Lies will begin a nationwide tour of the UK in late January 2009
White Lies, the band ranked second in the BBC's Sound Of 2009 poll will release their debut album To Lose My Life next week [19 January].
"I saw our first poster on the London underground today - a very weird experience," says drummer Jack Lawrence-Brown. "Because you see like hundreds of Razorlight posters all the time on the underground and our one was next to it."
It's an experience he, along with band mates Harry McVeigh [vocals] and Charles Cave [bass], ought to get used to though as many people are claiming White Lies are the perfect soundtrack to these doom-y, cash-strapped times and one of this year's biggest hopes.
Indeed the band have frequently appeared in January's numerous Ones To Watch features - something they'll describe as "really flattering".
Yet, they're also wary of the notoriety which automatically comes with it.
"We're a bit anxious to not get written off," he explains. "Not [to get] pigeon-holed before people have actually heard our album.
"I'm really glad people are seeing our potential - but I genuinely don't buy music based on reviews - I'll make my own opinion about it."
After a busy twelve months, culminating with a nationwide tour with Glasvegas, their focus now is firmly on a return to the road playing the record live, and not the amount of units they can shift.
White Lies came second in the BBC's Sound Of 2009
Without compromise
"For us we've already achieved what we wanted to," says Jack. "I know that's a weird thing to say as it's not even out but for us the making of the record was really quite a personal thing."
"We feel like we're in a good place."
With responsibility shared between the threesome, they're also a group firmly in control of their own destiny.
"We didn't want to compromise anything in the recording of the songs," states Jack.
"We avoid at all costs doing massive radio edits of songs and we don't write b-sides.
"Things like that mean staying true to yourself - doing what we felt would give us the best finished product when it came down to the album."
Much has been made of the LP's morbid fascinations, stories of death and depression wound around Interpol-esque melodies, Jack confirms that chief lyricist Charles Cave is a dark character.
"It's the same for all three of us that there's a side to our personality that's possibly more worried and more paranoid than most people's.
"While we do have a side to our personality that's quite dark and a little bit weird the rest of the time we're fairly grounded and considered people.
"I don't think we're circling into depression just yet."
While we do we do have a side to our personality that's quite dark and a little bit weird the rest of the time we're fairly grounded and considered people
Jack Lawrence-Brown, White Lies
Mischievous streak
Maybe a touch surprisingly, beneath the cloak of darkness there is also a touch of mischievousness about the west Londoners.
"I do tell quite a lot of white lies, I'm pretty bad about it," admits Jack. "I lie to people if they ask if I like what they've wearing - I usually don't.
"I lie to other musicians sometimes as well."
"You can't just go up to them and say 'Oh I really don't like your music'. So I lie about that quite a lot.
"You can't be one of those people - well I'm not - who says straight up to someone if I really dislike something about them - I think that a little bit untactful."
Whilst To Lose My Life only becomes available from next week the band, due to take part in this year's NME Awards tour beginning at the end of the month, already have one eye on the future.
"We're keen to keep evolving as a band but I don't think we'll churn out a second album which sounds like this one."

AFC Telford United sack manager Rob Smith

Telford enthusiasm had disappeared - Carter
AFC Telford United have sacked manager Rob Smith after four years, BBC Radio Shropshire reports.The news comes after Telford failed to reach the Blue Square North play-offs. Smith and assistant Larry Chambers joined Telford in February 2006, helping them avoid relegation from the Unibond Premier in their first season. They went up the following year after a 3-1 win play-off win at Witton and then twice went close to gaining promotion into the Blue Square Premier. Audio slideshow: Smith at Telford
The Bucks lost 4-0 on aggregate against Barrow in the play-off semi-final in 2008, then last year they slipped to a 1-0 defeat at Gateshead in the final. Smith had said he felt he was the right man to put things right and had hoped the board of directors would renew his contract. Captain Stuart Whitehead will take charge of the Bucks against Vauxhall Motors on the final day. You can follow the latest news of the departure of Rob Smith on BBC Radio Shropshire 96 FM.

Coe uncertain over Olympic costs
Coe has welcomed an English bid for the 2018 World Cup
Lord Coe has admitted it is still unclear what the final cost of staging the 2012 Olympics will be. He told BBC Radio Five Live he was in charge of raising �2bn of private money to stage the event. But the cost of building the venues would come out of the public purse - and that figure was yet to be agreed.
"I will be pleased when we get that figure. That figure has to be sustainable and it has to be robust," he said.
"We want transparency and we will get transparency.
"For very good reason I'm not going to get into figures, be it �5m, �6m, �10m and before we know it it's �20bn and it's bigger than Beijing, and all that."
He also emphasised the need for areas outside London to be part of the 2012 experience.
606 DEBATE: Give your reaction to this news
"I am acutely conscious that this is seen as a UK-wide project," he said. "Of course London is at the centre of it but what I think we are doing is bringing London up to the standard per head of population that most of the other regional cities like Birmingham, Manchester and Sheffield are enjoying.
"We've asked for UK-wide submissions from communities that have sporting facilities that would like to host a team or a coach and we've had 700 applications."
He also welcomed the possibility of an English bid for the 2018 football World Cup, insisting that it does not conflict with preparations for the 2012 Olympics.
"I'm entirely happy that we should, as an ambitious sporting nation, as and when we can host sporting events, we should bid for them," he said.
"As I said we want to use the Games as a catalyst for other events. There is room for a World Cup and an Olympic Games."

There have been more anti-government protests and arrests in the centre of Moscow overnight following Russia's parliamentary elections, which US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said were neither free nor fair.
