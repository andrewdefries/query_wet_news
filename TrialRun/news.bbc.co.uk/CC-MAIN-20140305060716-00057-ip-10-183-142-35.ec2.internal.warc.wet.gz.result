Brazil trade surplus soars
Lula takes office at a difficult time
Brazil has ended a dismal year for its economy on a high note, with news that its export industries have turned in their best performance in history and produced the highest trade surplus for almost a decade.
According to the ministry of development, industry and foreign trade, the surplus for 2002 - with two days left in the year - was $13.09bn (�8.17bn), the best performance since 1993 and more than five times the figure for 2001.
Exports totalled $60.14bn, the highest figure on record.
But the sharply improved performance on paper came partly because of the 34% slump in 2002 of the real, Brazil's currency, rendering exports much cheaper to their overseas buyers.
The currency's fall came as the main stock market, the Bovespa in Sao Paulo, marked the end of the trading year on a 12-month fall of 17%, reflecting investor unease at the prospect of leftwing president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Balancing act
Lula, who assumes the presidency on New Year's Day at a ceremony in the capital Brasilia, still has plenty of economic problems on his hands.
In exchange for a $30bn loan package desperately needed to keep $260bn in debt under control, he has promised the International Monetary Fund he will keep a 3.75% budget surplus, among other strictures.
Meanwhile, his army of supporters will remember the promises the former steelworker and his Workers' Party (PT) made in the run-up to the December election, to correct some of Brazil's vast inequalities and stamp down on rampant corruption.
At the same time, he has to contend with inflation which the Central Bank says will be 9.5% by the end of 2003, after 2002's double-digit inflation caused by currency-fuelled price rises.
The central bank raised interest rates for the third time in two and a half months earlier this month in an effort to quell inflation, lifting a key overnight rate by three percentage points to 25%, its highest level since April 1999.
That will make servicing Brazil's large domestic debts more difficult, although Lula's life has been made slightly easier by a lower-than-expected current account deficit of $7.5bn thanks to the high trade surplus.

Euro warning on e-commerce
Tories say the UK has natural advantages in e-commerce
The UK must stay outside the euro if it is to get the maximum benefit from the "global revolution" in e-commerce, leading Tories have warned.
A report by a commission of Conservative economic experts, appointed by party leader William Hague, has predicted dire economic consequences if Britain signs up to the European single currency.
John Nott: Euro is "greatest single issue of our time"Former defence minister Sir John Nott, who chaired the Commission on the Pound, told the Conservative conference that economic and monetary union was the "greatest single issue of our time."
Sir John warned that if the party lost its fight to preserve the pound "all is lost for our nation".
He accused the government of being stuck in a "post-war timewarp" in its economic thinking.
Blair 'has no radicalism'
Labour failed to appreciate how the euro would hold Britain back from making the most of its natural advantages in the new era of Internet shopping, he claimed.
Tony Blair: Dismissed as "a trendy middle-aged man"Rejecting the suggestion that Prime Minister Tony Blair was a "modern man", Sir John said the prime minister was "far more conservative than any former Tory leader I have known.
He has no radicalism in him."
He added: "In fact he is a trendy middle-aged man, former lawyer, who doesn't realise that the world is changing very fast
"The Internet and the coming revolution in e-commerce are making trading and currency blocks redundant.
"To survive in this new global world Great Britain must remain independent, flexible, liberalised and adaptable, all the things that the present European Union is not.
'City hub of revolution'
"The City of London, where I have spent half my working life, is at the hub of this new global revolution
Mr Nott says the euro would mean extra regulations for the City"It has great skills and infrastructure. It is in the right time zone
It has the great advantage that 80% of the world's electronically stored information is in English.
"It is the world's greatest offshore financial centre precisely because it is independent of any single major currency.
"And I have to say to my City friends that if this country was to go into the euro all sorts of regulations would be thrust on the City of London of which they are now free."
Euro 'fact of life'
Sir John, who is chairman of Hillsdown Holdings, insisted he and the other
members of the commission were "good Europeans" who "believe in the EU" and
wanted to see it prosper.
He acknowledged the euro was a fact of life but said it had "fatal flaws"
and would be "kept on life support by politicians long after it is brain dead
economically".
Sir John said: "We should remain committed and active members of the EU
because ultimately, the union of the peoples of Europe is about the maintenance
of peace on our continent.
"But, with our rather separate political and economic history, our global
reach - particularly in the services - and our huge overseas investments, the
majority outside the EU, it would be folly to give up what remains of our
economic independence by joining the European single currency."
The euro project meant "a slow but unstoppable move to a single government,
to European political union", he warned.
"To pretend otherwise to the British people is a deceit."
Tory divisions
Mr Nott was given a standing ovation for his speech.William Hague: Pledging to save the pound
Mr Hague also took up many of the same themes in his close-of-conference address.
He committed the Tories to fight the next general election with a promise to keep the pound.
However, there was fresh evidence of Tory divisions on the euro when it emerged that John Major had predicted that Britain would join the single currency if it was a success.
The comment made by the former prime minister in a lecture in the US was reported by The Independent.
Mr Major was quoted as saying that if "the politics of reason"
pointed to UK entry, it would join - but not
"with a glad heart."

Rooney's route to the top
Virtual Replay: 3D animation of Rooney's sweet strikes
By Phil McNulty
Our man with England
Analysis: How good is Rooney?
Rooney, the boy I know
Press reaction: Roon-mania
England's Wayne Rooney has priced himself out of everybody's market except Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich's with his brilliant displays at Euro 2004.
Abramovich watched, along with new Blues coach Jose Mourinho and chief executive Peter Kenyon, as Rooney added yet more millions to his value with two goals in the 4-2 win against Croatia.
And as a man who likes collecting footballing gems, the odds are shortening on Abramovich making Everton's 18-year-old Britain's first �50m footballer.
Rooney took applause from David Beckham as he left the field at Lisbon's Stadium of Light, while England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson made comparisons with Pele and Steven Gerrard labelled him "on current form Europe's best player".
It is all a far cry from England's last major tournament in Japan 2002, when Rooney was unknown to almost all the media who have elevated him to superstar status in Portugal.
Rooney has attracted comparisons with the likes of Kenny Dalglish
But at Everton, the youngster was already being talked about in hushed tones as the best player the famous old club had produced.
Former manager and then youth team coach Colin Harvey, a man never given to light praise, likened him to Kenny Dalglish - only quicker!
Rooney's stock and reputation was so high even then that he signed his junior forms on the pitch during an Everton game at Goodison Park.
And it remains one of Walter Smith's great regrets that he was unable to give him his debut before he was sacked.
Sadly for Smith, Rooney was still at Croxteth's De la Salle School - where his mother Jeanette was a dinner lady - and was therefore ineligible for first-team duty.
Had that red tape not wrapped around Smith's plans, he would have been in.
Feature: How BBC Sport spotted Rooney's potential
Even before he made his first-team debut, the then Everton defender David Unsworth told BBC Sport: "He won't just be a legend at this club - he will be THE legend."
Rooney was always destined to sign for Everton, refusing to remove his royal blue top when attending a trial at Liverpool.
There were no such problems at Everton, with youth coach Ray Hall saying: "When you get an experienced scout sitting there with his cup of tea quivering while you talk to the lad, you know he's a special talent."
Rooney had no interest in Liverpool. The only club he wanted to join was Everton.
Rooney's displays for Everton's youth team marked him out as a future star
Tales soon emerged of Rooney drawing applause from parents of both sides for scoring a stunning overhead kick in a junior game against Manchester United.
And of how the precocious 14-year-old would be thrown on as a substitute in games way beyond his years and turn defeats into victories with ease.
Harvey's relationship with Rooney was the closest at Everton, with the old Goodison legend driving the brilliant talent - while also proudly showing videos of goals he had scored to reporters at the club's Bellefield training ground.
Rooney received national prominence of a sort as the outstanding talent in Everton's run to the 2002 FA Youth Cup final, which he had guided them to almost single-handedly.
Rooney 'the new Pele'
A 35-yard free-kick in the semi-final at Spurs, hammered home with one foot after being fluffed with another, was alleged to have rendered Glenn Hoddle almost speechless in admiration.
Rooney was handed his debut as a 16-year-old in August 2002 - but exploded on the national psyche with his famous 25-yard winner against Arsenal on 19 October.
This was the coming of age of the boy who lived on a council estate with his parents and brothers and whose windows were covered in Everton pennants.
Everton wasted no time in signing Rooney on a professional contract
He was the quietly-spoken boy genius who went home after ending Arsenal's 30-match unbeaten run for a kick-about with his mates and a ride on his BMX.
Rooney signed his first professional contract in February 2003, moving up the wage bracket from �80-a-week to �13,000-a-week.
And he made his competitive debut for England six months after his goal against Arsenal at Sunderland's Stadium of Light - which brings us back to where we started and Benfica's famous home that was illuminated by the teenager's brilliance on Monday.
Rooney's life will never be the same again after Euro 2004, with the boy who only wanted to play for Everton likely to have his loyalty and ambition tested to the limit.
I just hope that money doesn't do the talking - come on Wayne, show us what a true blue you are!
From Craig Andrews
Have your say on 606
Chelsea and Manchester United are reportedly interested - but how much will they have to pay after the 11 days that have changed Wayne's world - and possibly Everton's world too?
Euro 2004 has opened up the road to superstardom for the youngster, and Rooney is ready to fulfil what Everton fans who saw him even as a teenager believed to be his destiny - namely greatness.
