More snow hits upstate New York
More snow squalls are on the way, forecasters say
Residents in northern New York state are facing more heavy snowfalls as they struggle to clear up to eight feet (2.4m) of snow.
Forecasters say an additional foot of snow could fall in the next few hours. In some areas, snow has been falling at a rate of 5in (12cm) an hour.
A state of emergency has been declared in and around Oswego county, which has seen more than a week of snow squalls.
Freezing conditions elsewhere in the US were blamed for at least 20 deaths.
'Unusually long'
Emergency crews have been struggling to clear roads in Oswego, where snow squalls have dumped snow by the foot on communities since Sunday. We catch up when it stops, but then it just comes again, even heavier

On Friday, the squalls shifted south into Syracuse, dropping up to eight inches (20cm) of snow.
But forecasters said there would be heavy snow bands over Oswego County on Saturday and they were likely to be persistent. Another 6-12in (15-30cm) of snow is forecast, pushing the seven-day total over 100in (254cm). "Everything is 10 times more difficult; Just getting out of the driveway, going to the store, anything," shop worker Debbie Allers told AP news agency. The so-called lake-effect snow is caused by the cold air picking up moisture as it moves over the warmer Great Lakes, and depositing it as snow inland.
Meteorologists say the storms in the Lake Ontario area normally last a couple of days, and it is unusual for them to last so long.
Extreme cold weather has also been affecting other north-eastern and central areas of the country.
Deaths linked to the cold have been reported in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin, New York and Maryland.

Winds stoke Victoria fire fears
Thousands of firefighters have come to Victoria from Australia and overseas
Strong winds are ripping through the Australian state of Victoria, where four major bushfires are still burning.
Three thousand firefighters are battling the blazes and 2,000 more are on stand-by in case the gusts open up new fire fronts.
Almost 400 schools have been closed in the state and millions of text messages sent out warning of the fire danger. Last month, more than 200 people were killed in southern Australia by fast-moving bushfires.
Cleared lines
Many Victorians awoke to rain and cooler temperatures than were forecast, reports the BBC's Nick Bryant, in Sydney. But state authorities have warned against complacency, because of the threat of gale-force winds and because the rain did not fall in fire-affected areas. Strong gusts, and the danger of falling tree branches, have already forced firefighters to pull out of bush land to the north of Melbourne. The fire-fighters are working to control four large blazes that have been burning for three weeks. Containment lines - cleared areas up to 60m (200ft) across - are currently holding the fires in check. Forecaster Evan Morgan told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that strong winds would continue into the night. Bushfires have been burning in Victoria for a month now, sparked by high temperatures and a prolonged drought. Police are also investigating whether some of the blazes were man-made; one man has been arrested.

Hammond to host Radio 2 specials
Hammond surprised doctors with his "remarkable" recovery
Top Gear host Richard Hammond is to present a series of Bank Holiday specials on BBC Radio 2.
The broadcaster, who began his media career in BBC regional radio, will present music-based shows at Easter, in May and August, and over Christmas.
Hammond, 36, said radio was "the most direct, immediate and personal medium".
He returned to presenting BBC Two's Top Gear earlier this year, four months after a crash during filming left him fighting for his life.
"To have the chance to share some time with listeners on the biggest station in the country is a huge and exciting opportunity," said the presenter.
He began his broadcasting career at BBC Radio York, later working at BBC Radio Cumbria, BBC Radio Leeds and BBC Radio Lancashire, before moving into motoring broadcasting.
'Romantic figure'
"I like to think that I was a rather romantic figure, a kind of wandering radio nomad," Hammond joked.
"So really, I don't want people to think of me as a timid newcomer but more as a triumphant, garlanded hero making a magnificent return to the arena of his former glorious victories."
Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas described Hammond as a "warm, funny and clever broadcaster".
"These specials will give him the opportunity to get close to the audience in a way only radio can - in a live, interactive and creative environment," she said.
The first show airs on Friday 6 April from 1400 to 1600 BST.

Keeping alive under terrorist attack
By Dr Sally Leivesley Managing director of Newrisk Limited
Information and preparation are the key to surviving any terrorist attack. Dr Sally Leivesley, a former scientific adviser on UK emergency contingency planning looks at how we can increase awareness of what to do in an emergency. Why will some survive ahead of others?
People are now on the front line of terrorist attacks and need to have basic information on how to survive without waiting to be told what to do when an attack is imminent. Governments have organised many services to respond after a terrorist attack but people need more information on how to recognise what is happening and what immediate action can be taken to keep alive. Moving out of the area (and waiting for decontamination) or taking shelter from a possible bomb or release of some contaminating material can help people to survive. Some individuals have shown incredible capability to survive because they have understood the cues or signs of some danger in their environment - a British survivor of the vehicle borne bomb on the British Consulate in Turkey knew enough to drop to the ground immediately before the bomb detonated. Some children in the Beslan school siege ran away quickly before the terrorists could take control and one adult jumped from a window quickly before others were shot. The best outcome is to stop terrorists making attacks through intelligence led operations where every piece of information is put together by police and action is taken to disrupt any terrorist plans. Keep vigilant
The public can contribute to this by reporting unusual behaviour in their neighbourhood, workplace or when travelling. Terrorists may rent space for cash, make unusual purchases of chemicals or have an interest in filming or finding out information about buildings or important sites such as power stations, airports or chemical storage facilities. If we have a small amount of fear we are alert and more ready to act when some cue lets us know about the danger Should we be afraid of being fearful? It is a bit like worrying about falling down the stairs or an escalator. We know it is a hazard but being a little fearful about a fall means we go slowly, hang onto the safety rail and we are careful. If we have a small amount of fear we are alert and more ready to act when some cue lets us know about the danger. We then will do what seems to match the cues we are seeing, hearing, smelling or being told about. Sometimes it is not clear what the danger is. If there is a bomb, people may not know whether it is an explosion from terrorists or an accident with some hazardous materials. Self-protection
In any release of radiological or other contaminating materials people will not know the best form of self-protection unless they have some information on how to suspect that there is contamination and wash away the contamination or wipe it off very quickly. The decontamination zone: A scene from the drama Dirty War
Governments can provide a small percentage of the information that will help individuals decide what to do in an extreme terrorist attack. The rest of the information will come from people's own experience.
This includes exercises or drills, their interpretation of the risks in their environment, what other people tell them, news stories and guidance from team leaders in the workplace, police and family members or friends. The most significant protective action in the workplace or at school will be the recent experience an adult or child has with walking to an 'inwards shelter,' which is a strong part of a building without any windows, or evacuating out of the building or an area. 'Walking this walk' will imprint in the adult or the child's mind a self-protective action that may automatically be followed in the stress of a real attack. This action will be more successful if it has been practiced reasonably frequently, for example every three months. Information
Before any global terrorist attacks, local authorities need to be prepared with a mass of information to help people with disruptions to work, transportation and shops, how to manage sick people in the community or fears about travelling to work or going back to school. Voluntary agencies can help to extend local services and volunteers can help if they are suitably protected and make risk assessments, protect their own health and safety when giving services to the public. To be safe and effective, volunteers need to have protective equipment, self-protection training and a good means of communication with their local authority.
Why worry when no attacks?
Terrorism is a game of cat and mouse by the terrorists who play on terror and their power to make an attack at any time. Sometimes there are no attacks because governments, police, security and defence forces are able to stop the terrorist planners from recruitment, planning, training and gaining access to weapons. Sometimes at the last minute, terrorists who are moving in to attack a target can be caught or deterred from making an attack. People can be aware that the terrorist attacks in other parts of the world are just like credit cards that can be used in their own country, city, town or village The best sign of the risk in Britain comes from the types of attacks that are happening in other countries, some as far away as Indonesia, Russia, and Spain. This information is 'open source' and available to everyone through the media. Such stories are talked about afterwards and people can learn about what types of weapons may be used, how their local environment might have similar targets and how the terrorists are successful or unsuccessful in causing casualties. People in any city, town or village can make a judgement about whether they are vulnerable to a similar attack and how they can protect themselves. Preparation
At present, after the Beslan school siege, governments will be considering schools and safety. The Japanese government has increased the security of its schools abroad following the Beslan school siege and the US government has announced it is looking at protection plans against school sieges. The lessons are there to be learned from these incidents. People can be aware that the terrorist attacks in other parts of the world are just like credit cards that can be used in their own country, city, town or village. If they can work out some simple plans then there can be a successful survival of adults and children if terrorists decide to attack in the local area. Leadership in making plans can be taken by any individual, a member of the family, people in a neighbourhood, local authorities, and headteachers in schools, team leaders in the workplace, emergency service chiefs, and news editors and by governments.

Scientists invent electronic DJ
Disc jockeys may soon have electronic rivals
Scientists in Bristol say they have designed the world's first disc jockey with artificial intelligence. It would be able to create and mix its own dance music and react to the mood of clubbers. The system has been developed at the Hewlett Packard (HP) laboratories.
The inventors say the electronic "hpDJ" would be able to select different beats and base lines from its own memory bank, mix them and even sample other tracks. I realized a lot of the techniques used in artificial intelligence could automate what DJs do
Dave Cliff, HP scientist At the same time it would respond directly to clubbers using a unique biofeedback system.
Dancers wearing remote sensors would send signals to the computer DJ, letting it know when they were bored with the music and wanted it changed. Dave Cliff, a scientist at HP in Bristol and part-time disc jockey, invented the hpDJ. He said: "I muck around as a DJ in my spare time and realized that a lot of the techniques used in artificial intelligence could be used to automate what DJs do. Digital format
"I wondered if we could invent software so people could use a home PC to create DJ-mixed compilations with no gaps between the tracks."
Once the tracks have been chosen and loaded into a computer in digital format, the hpDJ program analyzes each track.
Dave Cliff came up with the idea for the hpDJ
A club DJ typically builds tempo gradually, placing slower numbers at the end. In the same way, the computer programme measures tempo in beats per minute to decide on an order for the tunes.
The system also imitates a real DJ by altering the tempo, slowing down or increasing the speed of the music to make a seamless mix. The computer actually stretches out the beats to make them match from track to track.
"The human brain is not very good at recognizing small changes in the number of beats per minute, and this is the sort of thing that a computer does really well," said Mr Cliff.

50 Cent's poster gets a rapping
A poster showing rap star 50 Cent with a baby and a gun has been condemned for "glamorising" gun crime by the Advertising Standards Authority.
The image, used to promote his album and film called Get Rich or Die Tryin', sparked 17 complaints from people who found it irresponsible or offensive.
Some were particularly angry that it appeared in an area where gun crime amongst children had been a problem.
Advertisers said it was supposed to show 50's fight to escape the ghetto.

The ASA said the poster broke lots of rules about violence and anti-social behaviour, especially with regard to children.
They thought it was particularly wrong as many kids look up to the rapper.
50 has been criticised in the US already for a similar poster showing a gun and a microphone.

Tuesday's football photos
Man Utd 3-0 West Ham: The home side, looking to close the gap on Chelsea to one point, host West Ham and Antonio Valencia has an early chance for the hosts, but can only manage an embarrassing air shot
Man Utd striker Dimitar Berbatov goes for an early 50-50 ball with Hammers goalkeeper Rob Green. The Bulgarian is within his rights to do so, and Green emerges from the encounter unscathed
Brazilian midfielder Anderson is consoled by Hammers boss Gianfranco Zola after twisting his knee after just 10 minutes of play. He is replaced by South Korean Ji-Sung Park
The free-scoring Wayne Rooney notches his 26th goal of the season and gives the hosts the lead after a splendid move involving Park, Berbatov and Valencia, who provides the final, killer ball
Valencia is the provider again as he sets up Rooney for his 27th goal of the season and his 19th in 19 games. Four minutes later, he very nearly notches his hat-trick from the tightest of angles England's man of the moment Rooney is replaced by England's forgotten man Michael Owen and the 30-year-old gives his side a 3-0 lead with 10 minutes remaining Zola looks shellshocked after watching his side get ploughed into the Old Trafford turf by the indefatigable Rooney. The Hammers remain just four points above the relegation zone Stuttgart 1-1 Barcelona: It's the first leg of the last 16 clash between Stuttgart and Barcelona at the Mercedes-Benz Arena, and Brazilian striker Cacau gives the home side the lead after 25 minutes
Stuttgart's lead lasts until seven minutes after the restart, when $99m man Zlatan Ibrahimovic works an opening with Gerard Pique before equalising for the visitors
Olympiakos 0-1 Bordeaux: The visitors celebrate Michael Ciani's goal against Olympiakos, which is enough to give the French side a 1-0 lead after the first leg of their last 16 encounter in Athens E-mail this to a friend

Horrillo out of coma after crash
Horrillo has ridden for Rabobank for the past four years
Spain's Pedro Horrillo Munoz is out of an induced coma after falling into a ravine during Saturday's eighth stage of the Giro d'Italia to Bergamo.The Rabobank rider is in a serious, but not life-threatening, condition after the accident on the descent from San Pietro halfway through the 209km stage. Horrillo suffered broken bones and head trauma but should make a full recovery. Columbia rider Kanstantin Siutsou broke clear to win the stage, but Danilo Di Luca retains the overall lead. The Italian finished third, behind Norway's Edvald Boasson Hagen who won stage seven, to keep the pink jersey. The first attack of the stage came 29km after the riders had left the start in Morbegno. QuickStep's Dario Cataldo and David Garcia Lopez of the Caisse d'Epargne team made the initial move but they were joined by eight other riders. They led by 90 seconds as they reached the summit of the first climb, Culmine di San Pietro, and stretched it to over four minutes on the descent. But the technically challenging descent caught out Horrillo, who crashed and was found around 60m below his bike as paramedics recovered him from deep in a ravine. He had to be winched into a helicoptor, which took him to a Bergamo hospital. The Rabobank team doctor said Horrillo had sustained fractures to his thigh bones, kneecap and neck, as well as suffering a perforated lung and concussion. He was due to undergo an operation on his leg and knee on Sunday, but scans showed no sign of brain damage. The leaders were allowed to stay out until 16km from the finish when the peloton swallowed them up. But moments later, Siutsou, from Belarus, flew away from the pack and quickly built a 38-second lead. The Team Columbia rider appeared to be fading as he rode through the cobbled streets of Bergamo, but he found one last burst of energy to finish 21 seconds ahead of the field. "I live just 25km from Bergamo, parts of the course pass by there," said Siutsou. "I know the roads by heart and I know when the best moment is to attack. "This is my finest win and at the finish line, my wife, who is expecting a baby, was waiting." Sunday's ninth stage is a 10-lap 165km race around Milan. Britain's Mark Cavendish is among those tipped for the stage win. Looking forward to that possibility, Columbia team boss Bob Stapleton said: "We hope that Mark can come out to play, and show again that he's the fastest sprinter in the world. "The course suits him for sure and we'll try to win another stage and keep the run of success going." Stage Eight result:1. Kanstantsin Siutsou (Blr/Columbia ) 5hrs 04mins 34secs 2. Edvald Boasson Hagen (Nor/Columbia ) +21 secs 3. Danilo Di Luca (Ita/Team LPR ) Same time 4. Michael Rogers (Aus/Columbia ) 5. Franco Pellizotti (Ita/Liquigas ) 6.
