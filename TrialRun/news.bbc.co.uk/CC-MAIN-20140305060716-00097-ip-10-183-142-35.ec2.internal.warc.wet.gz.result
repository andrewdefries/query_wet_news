Darlington released player tally rises to 14
Mor Diop has been released after three goals in six months
Darlington have taken their tally of released players to 14 following their relegation to the Blue Square Premier.Among those leaving are Mark Bower, Nick Liversedge, Mark Convery, Gary Dempsey, Dan Groves, Simon Madden and Nathan Mulligan. Boss Simon Davey has also told Ross Chisholm and Patrick Deane they are surplus to requirements at the Arena. Ritchie Byrne, Rikki Bains and Stuart Giddings, Dan Riley and Mor Diop had already been released. Meanwhile Davey has made two signings this season in the shape of former Sunderland midfielder Jamie Chandler and defender Dominik Werling. "We have an idea which players we want to take into next season and which players we want to recruit, as a staff, so that'll be a side we think will be capable of competing to come straight back up," Quakers boss Simon Davey told BBC Tees.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The Quakers, under new boss Davey, intend an immediate return to the Football League following relegation. The former Barnsley boss said: "From my perspective, I am ambitious, the club wants to be ambitious, the chairman is ambitious and the fans want success," he said. "We want a team that is capable of winning a division, so it's an ideal opportunity for me to assess the players that I want to take forward and the ones we're recruiting. It's an ideal scenario that you tell them we want to be competing here. "We actually want to win the league - when we're speaking to the players, it's about hunger and desire to win."
