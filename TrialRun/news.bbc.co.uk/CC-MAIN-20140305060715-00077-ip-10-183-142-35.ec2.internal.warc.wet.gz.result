Putin to lead United Russia party
Vladimir Putin is keeping his grip on the levers of power
President Vladimir Putin has accepted an offer to become chairman of the dominant United Russia party.
Mr Putin, who steps down as Kremlin leader next month, told nearly 600 party delegates on Tuesday "I accept the invitation of the party". Mr Putin is due to hand over the presidency to his long-standing aide Dmitry Medvedev. Mr Putin confirmed that he would become prime minister. Correspondents say the party job will give Mr Putin an additional power base. United Russia controls two-thirds of the seats in parliament, and exerts great influence through its administrative and financial means. The party congress in Moscow was shown live on state-run television. Mr Medvedev declined to join United Russia, saying such a move would be "premature". He is due to be sworn in as president on 7 May. He won the 2 March election by a landslide. Referring to Mr Medvedev's decision, Mr Putin said "I do not believe it is sensible for a head of state, wherever his political affections are, to lead a party. Here I fully agree with Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev". "As for the chairman of the government (prime minister), a situation in which the head of the executive branch leads a party is a civilised and natural practice that is traditional for democratic states," Mr Putin told the congress. "Co-ordinated work between the government and the parliamentary majority allows us to successfully resolve the tasks of developing the economy, enhancing the quality of healthcare and education, raising the income of the population and strengthening the country's defence."

Bush blunders become bestseller
Mr Bush's gaffes: Is poor education the cause?
George W Bush "for some reason speaks English as if it's a second language", says Jacob Weisberg.
Mr Weisberg should know. The journalist for the online magazine Slate has compiled a book of the tongue-tied president's gaffes, George W. Bushisms: The Slate Book of The Accidental Wit and Wisdom of our 43rd President.
I think anybody who doesn't think I'm smart enough to handle the job is underestimating
3 April, 2000 It includes such gems as: "Families is where our nation finds home, where wings take dream."
States' rights defenders should be pleased by: "States should have a right to enact reasonable laws and restrictions, particularly to end the inhumane practice of ending a life that otherwise could live."
The Bushism "I will have a foreign-handed foreign policy," on the other hand, is unlikely to reassure either US foes or allies.
Possible explanations
Mr Weisberg says there are a number of possible explanations for the new president's remarkable way with words.
He told BBC News Online: "Theories range from dyslexia to stupidity to lack of education to lack of sophistication."
I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family
27 January, 2000 Mr Weisberg himself suspects "something akin to dyslexia", perhaps inherited from his father, George Bush Snr, who also had a tendency to trip over words.
Mr Weisberg also points to the president having had "one of the fanciest and most expensive, but least effective educations" available.
The president has a bachelor's degree from Yale and a business degree from Harvard Business School. His marks were average.
Not an intellectual
The Slate journalist also says Mr Bush does not have "much respect for the life of the mind.
"He's not a reader. He doesn't like intellectuals," Mr Weisberg said.
I understand small business growth. I was one
19 February, 2000 But, he said, Mr Bush's verbal gaffes have not hurt him.
On the contrary, "he's benefited from being underestimated - or 'misunderestimated', as he says", Mr Weisberg says.
Or, as Mr Bush himself put it, "They have miscalculated me as a leader."
Americans do not mind thinking their leader is not terribly bright, Mr Weisberg added.
"People derive a certain satisfaction from feeling the president is a bit thick. It's a chance to feel superior", Mr Weisberg said.
No failure to communicate
The journalist also pointed out that Mr Bush is not completely incomprehensible.
It's clearly a budget. It's got a lot of numbers in it
5 May, 2000 "Most of the time you have a rough idea of what he means. He's not failing to communicate," Mr Weisberg said.
The book, which was released around the time Mr Bush was inaugurated last month, is doing well. It is currently at number 52 on Amazon.com's bestseller list.
And the president continues to turn out several new Bushisms a week, keeping Mr Weisberg in business.
Perhaps he is merely taking advantage of an observation Mr Bush himself made in June: "There's not going to be enough people in the system to take advantage of people like me."

Recession fears hit Wall Street
Recession fears have seen profit-taking on Wall Street
Fears the global economy may not be able to avoid a recession pushed US share prices lower, despite a $250bn government bank rescue plan.
The Dow Jones index ended down 0.82% as investors turned their attention to the worsening economic outlook.
While bank shares were largely higher because of the US Treasury rescue plan, technology stocks fell.
Traders say Wall Street is expected to be nervous in the weeks ahead because of economic worries.
"The tone is cautious, I don't think anybody is pile-driving into the market," said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial in Boston.
"We certainly expect heightened volatility for a fair amount of time while we sort out just exactly what's going on," he added.
DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE: 14 October 2008
*All Times GMT
The US government has announced a $250bn (�143bn) plan to purchase stakes in a wide variety of banks in an effort to restore confidence in the sector.
Recession fears
President George W Bush said the move would help to return stability to the US banking sector and ultimately help preserve free markets.
US federal authorities will also temporarily insure most new debt issued by US banks and expand deposit insurance.
Among financial stocks, Morgan Stanley rose 21.2%, Bank of America was up 16.4%, Citigroup soared 18.2% and Wells Fargo rose 10.2%.
If HM Treasury were the corporate finance department of one of those battered investment banks that are now being rescued, it would be collecting a very fat fee
Robert Peston, BBC business editor
Read Robert's blogUS unveils $250bn banking rescue Investors have welcomed the US government's action but fears of a recession rather than a financial meltdown have now come to dominate thinking.
"The world is not going back to where it was before September," said Andrew Busch, a strategist with BMO Capital Markets in Chicago.
"The outlook for the economy has soured and we're still not sure by how much," he said.
In the US technology sector, profit worries drove chipmaker Intel down 6.2%.
Intel then rose modestly in after-hours trading as it reported a 12% rise in its third-quarter earnings.
Rescue plans
Earlier stock markets worldwide had risen, as investors bet that state action to strengthen the banking system would ease the credit crisis.
In Europe, Germany's Dax ended up 2.7%, while the UK's FTSE added 3.2%.

The US move follows similar steps taken by the UK and other European governments.
BBC business editor Robert Peston said the US and eurozone plans were variations on the template launched a week ago by the UK government despite reservations expressed by other leaders.
"If HM Treasury were the corporate finance department of one of those battered investment banks that are now being rescued, it would be collecting a very fat fee," he said.

Jailed activist attacked vehicles
The activists were banned from HLS in June
An animal rights activist who targeted Huntingdon Life Sciences has been jailed for six-and-a-half years.
Sarah Gisbourne, 39, was also given a two-year Anti-Social Behaviour Order to start on her release from prison.
Gisbourne was arrested in Hampshire, where she was living in November and later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause criminal damage.
She was sentenced at Peterborough Crown Court for offences from last July which caused �39,000 in property damage.
It was said in court that she attacked vehicles linked in some cases, though not all, with Huntingdon Life Sciences. Clear message
Cars were attacked with paint stripper and tyres were slashed.
Assistant Chief Constable Anton Setchell, national co-ordinator for Domestic Extremism (NCDE), said after the hearing: "The sentence sends a clear message to other potential extremists that they will be caught and convicted.
"It will also provide reassurance to victims of animal rights extremism.
"The crimes committed by Sarah Gisbourne caused great distress to the victims and this result shows that offences of this type will not be tolerated.
"This conviction has resulted from co-ordinated police work between Cambridgeshire Constabulary, Surrey Police and Hampshire Constabulary. It was a detailed and protracted investigation.
"Similar joint operations of this type, with regional and national collaboration between police forces, are ongoing."

Driver spots big cat
A 'puma-like' animal killed a dog two weeks ago
A big cat has been spotted by a driver in west Wales when it crossed the road in front of her car.
The woman told Dyfed-Powys Police she saw the animal on the A40 at Broad Oak near Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire on Sunday.
A police helicopter was launched to try to catch sight of the animal but without success.
This is the fifth sighting of a 'big cat'
Two weeks ago, a black puma-like animal killed a pet in nearby Llangadog.
There have been other sightings in the area since then, and armed police spent several days trying to find the animal.
A police inspector said there were no plans to call out marksmen again for the latest sighting.
Farmer Mike Shepherd, 62, first saw a cat-like animal attack and kill a neighbour's pet whippet on his farm in Llangadog, which was then joined by another animal thought to be its cub.
Predator
A post-mortem examination on the dog confirmed it had been killed by a large predator.
Further tests were ordered, as the examination proved inconclusive, but DNA results have not come back yet.
Four further sightings of a big cat in the area were reported following the attack.
Police warned farmers to be vigilant and to patrol their land in pairs.

Man City agree to release Reyna
Reyna captained the USA at the 2006 World Cup
Manchester City have agreed to release former United States captain Claudio Reyna from his contract.
The 33-year-old midfielder is expected to return to his homeland after three-and-a-half years at Eastlands.
He arrived from Sunderland for �2.5m in August 2003 and during his time at City made 77 starts and scored four goals.
City boss Stuart Pearce had hinted earlier in January that the player was considering making a return to the United States for family reasons.
Reyna, who signed a one-year contract in January 2006, played his final game for City in the 2-1 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur back in December.
Last season his first-team chances were hampered when he broke an ankle and he has also been a peripheral figure during the current campaign.

Crusaders 44-20 Bradford
Crusaders (20) 44 Tries: Thomas, Mellars, Hauraki 2, Martin, Youngquest, Withers Goals: Schifcofske 8Bradford (10) 20 Tries: Nero, Halley, Worrincy, Whitehead Goals: Sykes 2
Schifcofske produced a faultless display with the boot for Crusaders
Crusaders put memories of last weekend's defeat by Harlequins behind them to record a convincing victory over Bradford at the Racecourse Ground.First-half tries for Crusaders by Gareth Thomas, Vince Mellars and Weller Hauraki were answered by Chris Nero and Dave Halley for the Bulls. Michael Worrincy and Elliott Whitehead crossed for Bradford after the break. But further scores from Hauraki, Tony Martin, Nick Youngquest and Lincoln Withers ensured victory for the hosts. It was the third time in four meetings that the Crusaders have beaten the Bulls, having previously run out 19-0 winners at the Murrayfield Magic weekend. Thomas got them off to a great start when he finished off a fine move involving Mark Bryant and Martin. Mellars then made the most of a two-man overlap and Rhys Hanbury put in Hauraki under the posts to put Crusaders in apparent control. But the Bulls burst into life as Nero went in at the corner before Halley touched down under the posts, with the conversion closing the gap to eight points. A Clinton Schifcofske penalty stretched the home side's advantage back to 10 points before the break, and it stayed that way as Worrincy and Martin exchanged tries. Bradford piled on the pressure, but Crusaders survived and took their chance when Hauraki crashed over for his second and Hanbury put Youngquest in near the posts. Withers then crashed over to seal Crusaders' first double over a Super League side, meaning Whitehead's late score for the Bulls was little more than consolation. Crusaders head coach Brian Noble: "I'm really pleased for the players. We have not been in the winner's enclosure for three or four weeks now so it just reinforces the belief and confidence in the side. "It was also about reinforcing the things that made us successful at the start of the year. We went back to some of the small things today." Bradford assistant coach Lee St Hilaire: "I thought we were in the game in the first-half but we started slow and they started fairly quick. "From that period then (when Crusaders were 18-0 up), we finished the better and stronger side. "We had a fair amount of the ball but we were slightly off on our execution. It was just about some of the players putting the ball over the line which is what we practised all week. "We were missing some key personnel and, if we had had them, we may have got four more tries." Crusaders RL: Schifcofske, Thomas, Martin, Mellars, Youngquest, Lupton, Hanbury, O'Hara, Withers, Bryant, Hauraki, Chan, Winternstein. Replacements: Dyer, Peek, Flower, James. Bradford: Halley, Sheriffe, Wardle, Nero, Reardon, Sykes, Kearney, Scruton, L'Estrange, Hall, Worrincy, Whitehead, Menzies. Replacements: Addy, Kopczak, Crossley, Godwin. Attendance: 2,979 Referee: Phil Bentham (Warrington). Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Rafael Nadal eases into Rome Masters third round
Nadal looks in good form ahead of May's French Open
Spain's Rafael Nadal remains on course to retain his Rome Masters title after sweeping aside Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-1 6-3 to reach the third round.The 23-year-old broke the German world number 29 four times in a match that lasted only one hour and 10 minutes. Nadal eased through the first set, breaking in the second and sixth games. Kohlschreiber wasted a chance to break Nadal in the fifth game of the second set and was made to pay as the Spaniard broke again on his way to victory. Nadal, the world number three, faces Romania's Victor Hanescu in the next round as he aims to win his fifth title in six years at the Foro Italico. 606: DEBATE
How will Nadal do this season? "It probably wasn't my best match but I did well, I played safe," said Nadal. "I was focussed the whole time and I tried to be more aggressive. "He made more mistakes than usual which helped me a little bit but my serve was working very well." Fifth seed Robin Soderling also moved into the third round with a 6-1 7-5 win over Italian wild card Paolo Lorenzi. World number 10 and seventh seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga recorded an easy 6-2 6-3 win over Serbian Viktor Troicki, sixth seed Fernando Verdasco overcame Italian Simone Bolelli 7-6 (13-11) 6-3, while 11th seed Ivan Ljubicic beat Nicolas Almagro of Spain 7-5 7-6 (7-3). However, former Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt fell to a 6-2 6-3 loss to Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez.
