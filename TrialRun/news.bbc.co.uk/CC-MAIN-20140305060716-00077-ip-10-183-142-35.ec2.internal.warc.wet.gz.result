Eyewitness: Ivory Coast stampede
The floor was covered in the bodies of the injured and dead
A stampede at a football stadium in Abidjan, Ivory Coast has left 19 people dead and 130 injured.Ousmane, an engineer, from Abidjan, was caught up in the stampede with his friends and their children. He described the scenes to BBC News. A group of us, we went together to see the match. We had tickets for the game, and we had children with us.When we arrived at the stadium, there were lots of people - more people than there were places. They tried to force entry. That's when the policemen arrived with tear gas. In the panic, there were lots of people running in every direction. I was very afraid. The gas was in my eyes. It was difficult, painful. There were a lot of people afraid - running everywhere. Some people fell down and they were crushed. Some children died because they didn't have anywhere to run. I saw people on the ground - injured people, waiting for doctors. There were a lot of people on the floor, waiting to go to hospital. The ambulances were not enough. No controlIt was bad organisation.
There were a lot of people afraid - running everywhere. Some died because they didn't have anywhere to run.

Fans blamed for stampede
'Stampedes not an issue' for 2010
We saw the policemen and the football federation... we saw these men take money from people to let them enter the stadium - people who did not have tickets. And the people who did have tickets, they cannot enter. This is why the situation arose, I think. The people who have tickets were outside. We had tickets, but after what happened, we took our children and went back home. Nobody in the stadium could have known what was happening. It all happened outside. After what I saw, I can't imagine going to another match in Ivory Coast, in this situation. I would be very afraid to go again. The authorities need to find a good way to control people.

In pictures: Global protests over Burma
Burmese embassies across Asia have been targeted by protesters angered by events in the military-run country.
Thousands gathered in the capitals of Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Australia among others on Friday.
They are protesting over the Burmese military's bloody crackdown on recent anti-government protests, that left at least nine people dead on Thursday.
Many fear a repeat of 1988, when the regime brutally suppressed the last popular uprising, killing around 3,000 people.
The crackdown on monks, who have led the protests, has outraged many. This Filipino man's head is shaved beside a poster of Burmese leader Than Shwe.
Workers at the foreign ministry in Indonesia tied red bands around each other's arms before holding a silent protest.
This protest in the centre of Kuala Lumpur was watched by a man from inside the Burmese embassy.
Many protesters carried pictures of Aung San Suu Kyi, who has become a symbol of resistance in Burma.
Posters of Than Shwe were attacked by protesters in the Philippines.
