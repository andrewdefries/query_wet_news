Yahoo 'in talks' over Indian deal
Yahoo is hoping to profit from growing internet usage in India
Yahoo is in talks about buying a stake in Indiatimes, the internet business of India's largest media company, the Financial Times (FT) has reported.
The FT said the US search engine was discussing a tie-up with Bennett Coleman, the publisher of The Times of India newspaper and other titles.
The publisher is looking for a partner to develop its online services, a move which may lead to a US flotation.
Yahoo is keen to expand in India where internet usage is growing fast.
Potential funders?
Bennett Coleman separated its internet operation from the rest of the business in 2000, listing it separately on the Indian stock market.
Indiatimes is one of the country's most popular internet portals, attracting more than a billion monthly page views.
The FT reported an executive with Bennett Coleman as saying that the company hoped to conclude discussions within the next month.
However, he said the company was also talking to other sources of potential funding, including private equity groups.
"An internet initiative requires plenty of investment and since we hope to take our portal to the Nasdaq, we will require support," he said.
Both Bennett Coleman and Yahoo declined to comment on the report.
Yahoo has a research & development operation in Bangalore and an embryonic partnership with Indian online business, rediff.com.
The Times of India is Bennett Coleman's best known title.
Originally launched in 1838, the English language daily has a circulation of more than 21 million.

Steel moves to the internet
Steel factories may soon be filled with goods bought online
Europe's four leading steel producers have announced plans to set up two e-commerce market places for their industry.
The virtual steel market would be just the latest in a wave of new business-to-business (b2b) web exchanges that are set to transform entire industries and dramatically cut costs.
Anglo-Dutch Corus, Germany's Thyssen Krupp, France's Usinor and Luxembourg's Arbed hope to launch the two web sites early next year.
Steel will be sold on Steel24-7.com, while BuyforMetals.com will be designed as e-procurement site to buy raw materials, services, repairs, logistics and other goods.
B2b fashion
The two web sites join a rapidly increasing number of similar ventures for other industries.
Four of the world's leading car makers recently announced the creation of Covisint, designed to bring big buyers and suppliers together.
There are several rival plans to set up web exchanges for the oil industry, while the world of metals already boasts steelscreen.com, spectronmetals.com, coppernet.com, materialnet.com and others. Steely competition
In the metals industry most b2b sites announced so far are stand-alone sites, or run by just one company. With demand for steel currently very high, they have found it extremely difficult to get hold of enough material to start trading at all.
The producers, meanwhile, are joining forces as they are worried that they might lose control of the market place, said Philip Tomlinson, director of steel at commodities consultants CRU International.
He believes that it is still far from certain which of the competing web site will ultimate prevail and become the market maker.
Cutting costs
The founding partners of the new online trading platform for the steel market promise that it will offer "permanent liquidity guaranteed by the participation of major players".
Rivals in the steel industry have been invited to join the exchange, and share in its profits.
Finding buyers and sellers on the web should make pricing more transparent and cut costs in the supply chain.
At the same time it will take business away from traditional metal exchanges, cutting out the middlemen.
The steel industry is desperate to cut costs, as it has only just recovered from a collapse of prices one year ago.. Since early 1999, steel prices have slowly crept up again, but analysts at the CRU Steel Price Index warn that they may have peaked already. As competition increases, the benefit of cost cutting may ultimately be passed on to steel consumers, said CRU's Philip Tomlinson.
The dire market situation has forced steel producers to join forces and merge. All four involved in the web venture have already been through this process: Krupp joined Thyssen, British Steel and Koninklijke Hoogovens formed Corus, Arbed snapped up Spanish rival Aceralia, while Usinor merged with Sacilor as long ago as 1987, and gobbled up Cockerill Sambre of Belgium. Despite such mergers, both European and American steelmakers have come under pressure from cheaper steel imports produced in Asia and Latin America.
Price-fixing worries
However, b2b exchanges have come under criticism recently. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether such web sites could potentially lead to price fixing, as the bargaining power shifts to industry giants.
The four steel partners promise that Steel24-7.com will be an "open and neutral internet marketplace". Search BBC News Online

Pop Idols in youth charity concert
Will, Darius and Gareth have been made ambassadors
A charity concert by the stars of Pop Idol is expected to raise �250,000 in aid of the Prince's Trust youth charity.
Winner Will Young, runner-up Gareth Gates and Darius Danesh joined seven other finalists for the performance at London's Docklands Arena on Saturday.
The trio have been named as young ambassadors by the charity and Will said it was a "huge honour" to be asked to help.
Prince Charles had planned to attend the event, but was forced to cancel because of the death of the Queen Mother.
'Wonderful opportunity'
Will, 23, said: "It is a huge honour and a fantastic opportunity for us to be able to fund-raise for such a great cause."
To be given the opportunity to help raise money for the Prince's Trust is wonderful
Gareth Gates
He said he was particularly pleased to help the Trust in its role helping 14 to 30-year-olds develop their confidence, learn new skills and find work, because he had battled with nerves during Pop Idol.
"Confidence is the most important quality," said Will. "And if the Prince's Trust can use us to heighten its image and help others develop their confidence
then it can only be a good thing."
Gareth added: "To be given the opportunity to help raise money for the Prince's Trust is wonderful.
"We all hope we are able to raise enough to help make a difference to the lives of some of the people involved in the Trust."
Pop Idols praised
The stars were approached to be ambassadors for the charity after visiting a project in Tower Hamlets, east London.
Darius will represent the charity in his native Scotland.
The Trust's chief executive Tom Shebbeare said praised the offer of help from the singers, who have recently finished a 21-date tour.
He said: "I was amazed when I received a phone call from Will, a few days after he had met one of our teams from Tower Hamlets, asking how he could help.
"It is that kind of commitment that really makes a difference."
A St James's Palace spokesman said Prince Charles hoped to meet the new ambassadors in the near future.

Birds of a feather
If you the film Jurassic Park frightened you about recreating dinosaurs through genetic engineering, then your worst fears could well be confirmed.
Watch a computerised animation of the evolution of the dinosaur to birdAs the debate in the natural history world concerning the link in origin between the dinosaur and the bird rages on, scientists at the University of Connecticut have taken the relationship one step further, according to the BBC's Horizon programme.
They are currently researching the possibility of switching off the various genes, which currently make up a bird, to re-create a living dinosaur.
They have already managed to remove the beak gene in the embryo of a chick to replace it with the tissue of another animal that produces dentine, the essential ingredient of all the teeth. Inserting new tissue into a chick embryoSo far, scientists have only been able to create an individual tooth, but research shows that in principle, they could "de-bird" a bird, giving it a full jaw of teeth, like that belonging to the dinosaur.
The possibilities seem endless. Take out the feather genes and replace them with ones for scales, and take out the wing genes and put in the necessary ones for arms - a small, predatory dinosaur has been made.
But before the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds decides to change its name, and before people contemplate putting protective roofs on their homes, scientists say they are not contemplating any re-creation of the prehistoric giant. William Upholt from Connecticut University's School of Dental Medicine says: "The results of these experiments may eventually be useful for tooth regeneration for people who have lost their tooth through disease or accidents, or people who have no teeth at all."
New beginnings
Scientific discussions and research on the origin of birds from dinosaurs have also entered a new phase in the past few months.
Recent fossil finds in north-eastern China have amazed paleontologists and ornithologists as they seem to confirm the dinosaur at least as a primitive, clumsy version of birds as we recognise them today. John Ostrom: Making the natural world sit up and listenScientist John Ostrom from Yale University has been waiting for this day for 30 years, during which he has assiduously studied and compared the skeletons of dinosaurs and birds and concluded startling similarities.
"I'm so excited by the developments in China that I can't talk about it enough. The discoveries show that there is a whole new chapter of theological time preserved in China," says Mr Ostrom. His theory is simple. Over millions of years, a small predatory dinosaur developed into a feathered dinosaur, which over yet more time acquired the ability to fly. Finally, after more millions of years, predatory birds developed into the modern ones we see today.
An age-old story
This year, farmers in the north-east region of China were found to have been excavating hundreds of fossils every day. Contrary to local belief that these were the remains of ancient dragons, they turned out to be some of the best-preserved fossils in the world, surviving for more than hundreds of millions of years.
Contrary to popular belief, some dinosaurs were no bigger than a turkeyThe fossils, apart from their exquisite beauty, gave new impetus to Mr Ostrom's theories and provided the essential missing link in the origin of birds.
One of the fossils turned out to have the anatomy of a dinosaur with what appeared to be a fringe of feathers running down its back. Could it really be a feathered dinosaur?
An animated portrait of the CaudipteryxAnd since its discovery, other feathered dinosaurs have been found in China - the latest named "feathered tail" or Caudipteryx.
Their appearance sent shockwaves through the natural history world.
Prior to this, the only other "real" evidence of the link between birds and dinosaurs had been Archaeopteryx, also a fossil of a feathered dinosaur found by German scientists 100 years ago.
How could this creature....But one of Mr Ostrom's staunchest opponents, Alan Feduccia, an ornithologist at the University of North Carolina, stands firm. He says birds evolved long before dinosaurs came along. They descended from much more primitive reptiles, and any similarities, such as they both walk on their hind legs, are coincidental. He calls it convergent evolution.
Mr Feduccia says: "One of the most examples of convergence are the ancient fish reptiles and dolphins. They are superficially almost identical, but when one looks at the structure in detail, the similarities fall down."
The heights of evolution
Researchers from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, concluded that Caudipteryx and the other fossils were undeniably feathered dinosaurs, but they were not able to fly. be the descendant of this?If Caudipteryx was to be the missing link between dinosaurs and birds, how did its descendants ever get off the ground? According to Mr Ostrom, the bird's flexible arm and wrist which enable it to flap its wings up to 12 times a second, were nevertheless inherited from Caudipteryx and Archaeopteryx. Watch Archaeopteryx take to flightThe former had the same distinctive wrist as the modern-day bird, and the latter used this wrist to flap its wings to carry out a primitive type of flying, like cruising for moderate distances.
Biologist Jeremy Rayner from Bristol University says: "The difficult thing for a bird is taking off and landing, hovering, changing flight direction, escaping predators, all these things, I don't think Archaeopteryx could do.
Learning to fly"I think probably it was quite a clumsy flier."
For the moment, Mr Ostrom's theories have been vindicated, thanks to the positive response of the natural history world to the discovery of the fossils from China.
And if some of the genetic possibilities are pursued to their full impact, the feathered dinosaur or the toothed bird could no longer be a creature belonging only to the most bizarre of sci-films.

Prince Harry recovers after thumb op
Prince Harry: Keen to get back on the football pitch
Prince Harry has undergone a minor operation after chipping a bone in his thumb playing football.
The 16-year-old Prince was back at Eton on Friday with his hand in a sling after the operation at a local hospital on Thursday, said St James's Palace.
"He is in good spirits but frustrated that he cannot play any sport at the moment," said a Palace spokeswoman.
The accident happened more than a week ago when the Prince was having a "kick about" in free time with friends at his exclusive Berkshire school.
Minor operation
"Someone landed on him and Harry hurt his thumb," said the spokeswoman.
"At first it was thought to be only a minor injury - bruising - so it was bandaged and cold packs put on it."
But the injured thumb was later X-rayed as a precaution, revealing a chipped bone and collateral damage.
Doctors decided to carry out a minor operation under local anaesthetic.
No school uniform
The Prince of Wales, was kept fully informed and visited his son at Manor House, Eton, on Thursday after the operation.
The prince has been excused wearing his Eton uniform - stiff winged collar and tailcoat - because of the sling.
But he is able to attend classes because he is right-handed and has injured his left thumb.
Like his older brother William, 18, Harry is a keen sportsman who enjoys football, rugby, polo and swimming. The prince is in his third year at Eton and is studying for his GCSEs. Search BBC News Online

| HelpCounty Championship D2, Worcester, day four: Worcestershire 696-8 dec beat Somerset 318 & 322 by an innings and 56 runs Worcestershire 22 pts, Somerset 4
Scorecard
Worcestershire had to work hard to collect the final two Somerset wickets before completing victory by an innings and 56 runs at New Road.
Resuming on 220-8, the visitors added 102 to their total before Kabir Ali bowled Simon Francis for 29 to bring the game to an end.
Francis added 55 with Carl Gazzard, who resisted for two and half hours for his 44 not out.
Andy Caddick was the other wicket to fall, caught off Ray Price for 39.
Price finished with 4-67, but spin partner Gareth Batty was unable to add to his tally on the final morning and had final figures of 4-121.
Worcestershire laid the foundation for their victory on days two and three as centuries by Zander de Bruyn, Ben Smith and Steven Davies carried them to a club record total of 696-8 declared.
De Bruyn's 161 was the perfect way for him to end his stint as one of the county's overseas players. He is set to link up with the South Africa A side, with West Indies Chris Gayle taking over on the county staff.
The win lifted Worcestershire back into contention for promotion back to Division One after a run of four successive defeats.
"It was absolutely vital we won this one, but I can't stress enough that is those four defeats we played some good cricket. That's got to be a good sign," said coach Steve Rhodes.
"We have now got games against teams that are above us or challenging and I think that's a good thing.
"They are obviously good sides and are coming into the games with lots of confidence, but they are almost double-pointers and that's going to be an advantage for us if we want to go up." E-mail this to a friend

Liverpool 3-3 West Ham (aet)
Liverpool win 3-1 on penalties
Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard lifts the FA Cup
Liverpool beat West Ham on penalties to win a thrilling FA Cup final.
The Hammers took an early two-goal lead thanks to Jamie Carragher's own goal and Dean Ashton's close-range strike, before Djibril Cisse pulled one back.
Steven Gerrard lashed home an equaliser after the break before Paul Konchesky's speculative cross put West Ham ahead.
Gerrard's stunning last-minute strike forced extra-time, with Pepe Reina saving from Bobby Zamora, Konchesky and Anton Ferdinand in the shoot-out.
Interview: Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard Interview: Rafael Benitez
Interview: West Ham manager Alan Pardew
Dietmar Hamann, Gerrard and John Arne Riise all scored from the spot for Liverpool, with only veteran Teddy Sheringham finding the net for West Ham.
The game began with all three major injury doubts on the pitch.
Liverpool were able to select Xabi Alonso while West Ham included Ashton and Matthew Etherington.
Ashton was instrumental as West Ham shocked Liverpool by taking the lead after 21 minutes.
His brilliant pass released Lionel Scaloni, whose cross was unwittingly turned past Reina by the inrushing Carragher at the near post.
Another error, this time by keeper Reina, handed West Ham a two-goal advantage six minutes later.
Etherington's tame shot should have posed no problem for the goalkeeper, but he fumbled the ball at the feet of Ashton, who bundled home from close range.
West Ham got some lucky goals but played in exactly the right way - I'm as disappointed for them as I'm delighted for our lads
From Liverpool fan
Have your say on 606
Liverpool desperately needed to hit back quickly and, after Peter Crouch had an effort ruled out for offside, Cisse threw the favourites a lifeline after 31 minutes.
The French striker met Gerrard's raking pass on the volley to fire a firm finish past Shaka Hislop.
Ashton was a constant source of danger and was only inches off target with an angled drive as Liverpool struggled to contain the striker.
Reina made amends for his earlier mistake with two crucial saves in the space of seconds just after the re-start.
After Etherington's cross had exposed the Liverpool defence, Reina blocked from Yossi Benayoun and Marlon Harewood in quick succession.
Liverpool were level after 54 minutes thanks to their most potent threat, midfielder Gerrard.
The inspirational captain lashed a fierce drive high past Hislop after Alonso's free-kick was headed down by Crouch.
But just as Liverpool seemed to have assumed control, West Ham regained the lead in freakish fashion.
Konchesky's left-wing cross was speculative at best, but it caught the back-pedalling Reina off guard and floated in at the far post.
As the clock ticked around to 90 minutes, Gerrard was Liverpool's saviour again when his first-time drive from fully 35 yards flew past Hislop's right and into the net.
In extra-time, Riise almost scored a goal to rank alongside Gerrard's with a long-range effort that flew just over the angle.
West Ham almost snatched victory with 90 seconds left of added time when Nigel Reo-Coker's deflection was turned on to the post by Reina.
A goalmouth scramble followed before Harewood, who was suffering badly from cramp, shot wide with the goal at his mercy.
It set up a dramatic penalty shoot-out, with Reina making up for a poor performance during normal time with three crucial spot-kick saves.
