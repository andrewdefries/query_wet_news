Brazil cardinal questions celibacy
The Pope has been addressing Church sex scandals
Tom Gibb
BBC correspondent in Sao Paulo
A leading member of Brazil's Roman Catholic Church has criticised the obligatory celibacy of priests.
In an interview published by the Brazilian newspaper O Globo, Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns said that celibacy should be an option rather than a requirement.
Arns said he was happy being single himself
He also said that he believed Church policy would not change during the papacy of Pope John Paul II, who last week reiterated that priests should remain celibate.
Cardinal Arns said that celibacy was a rule imposed by the Church, which did not come from the Bible. He pointed out that the first pope, St Peter, was married. Why shouldn't those who want to choose marriage do that, he asked? He said that he himself preferred to be single because it allowed him to dedicate himself completely to the Church, but others, he said, need the companionship of a woman. Personal opinion
While one of Brazil's senior churchmen, Cardinal Arns is also seen as far more liberal than most of the rest of the Church hierarchy. There will be no change under the present Pope, says Arns
Others have hastened to point out that he was expressing a personal opinion, not that of the Brazilian Church. When asked whether the Church was considering changing its rules, Cardinal Arns said that with Pope John Paul II that would be impossible. He said the Pope had made his views well known and had even prohibited discussion of the issue. "We're talking about it now," he said, "because we're free." In the wake of the scandals in the United States, the Catholic Church in Brazil has also been hit by a number of scandals of priests accused of abusing children. A debate has started not only about how to deal with paedophile priests but the whole issue of celibacy as well.

What are futures and options?
The world of futures looks complicated, and is The world of derivatives, financial instruments such as futures and options, is notoriously complicated. BBC News Online presents a - relatively - simple guide to how these poorly understood investments function.
Futures The original derivative was a future used by farmers to set the price of their produce in advance. Before they started sowing they would make a deal to sell their goods at a certain price come harvest time. This enabled them to work out how much they could spend on planting and tending their crops. After the harvest, goods would be sold at the pre-agreed price no matter what the movements of the market. Sometimes the future contract would earn a profit compared to the market price, other times it would generate a loss - but it allowed the farmer to eradicate uncertainty. Futures on agricultural goods, metals, oil and gas, bonds and currencies are traded on exchanges round the world. The value of a future is determined by the relationship between the price set in the contract and the market price, the length of time until the contract is due - and supply and demand in the market. Futures contracts specify the quality, quantity and location for goods to be delivered, but not many are used to actually sell goods. Most are settled by cash payment on the date that delivery is due, with the holder paying or receiving the difference between the price set in the contract and the market price. Options Options were invented because people liked the security of knowing they could buy or sell at a certain price, but wanted the chance to profit if the market price suited them better at the time of delivery. So for a certain fee - called the premium - an option gave them the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell at a certain price. An option to sell, known as a put option, would only be exercised if the price set in the futures contract was higher than the market price at the time of harvest, and vice versa for an option to buy, or call option. Working out the cost of an option is extraordinarily complicated. There are many pricing mechanisms in use, most involving complex mathematical formulas. The most famous options pricing model is known as Black-Scholes. There are also many different types of option - with exotic and alarming names such as knock-in and knock-out, barrier, binary and Asian options - most of which vary either the time or the price at which the options can be exercised.

BBC News | TALKING POINT | Tobacco wars: Is $3bn a fair damage award?

Tobacco wars: Is $3bn a fair damage award?
A jury in the US has ordered the tobacco company Philip Morris to pay more than $3bn to a smoker suffering from terminal cancer who said the company did not warn him of the dangers of smoking.
The payment is by far the largest punitive damage award ever made against a cigarette maker to an individual, and has sent shock waves through an industry already facing similar lawsuits.
The verdict is nearly 40 times larger than the $80m awarded an Oregon man in 1998, which was subsequently greatly reduced by a judge.
Is the $3bn payout justified? Do you think that smokers are to blame for risking their health or should the tobacco companies pay compensation for the damaging effects of their product?
This debate is now closed. Read a selection of your comments below.
Your reaction
The award of a fine of $3bn was made by the court because an award in the "millions" would have no effect on the company and would not act as any deterrent in future. I am sure that the "victim" was aware of an effect on his body, however, was he fully aware of what gasses and toxins make up the average cigarette. In my experience, smokers know very little of the real effects of smoking. Perhaps the law should be changed to list all gasses and poisons contained and the amount, the same as foodstuffs in packets have to display food colouring etc contained within the relevant product.
David Butler, Australia
Any argument based on ignorance is spurious and a refusal to accept personal responsibility
Moez Qayyum, England
By now the effects of smoking are well known, and for at least the past 20 years there has been a consensus (with the exception of a few smoking industry sponsored studies) that smoking causes cancer and heart disease, etc. So to anyone still smoking, caveat emptor! Any argument based on ignorance is spurious and a refusal to accept personal responsibility, smokers to it to themselves. That the tobacco industry uses massive advertising to persuade others to take up the habit should be no surprise, their business is to sell cigarettes, and as we all know they must constantly recruit new users; but until it is made illegal, a little less sanctimony from the government, which does very well indeed out of smoking would be nice. If they really cared about the effects of smoking, they would promote health education in the Third World where these companies are aggressively marketing their product. But then it is western governments' interest to shift the health burden elsewhere, whilst still taxing the profits of the tobacco companies. I am not a smoker! Moez Qayyum, England
I don't smoke - it's my choice - just as it's everyone's choice - no one is ever forced to smoke. I agree with the point about using the billions awarded to highlight the dangers of smoking to the Third World, and perhaps ban tobacco advertisements completely?
Stephen, Wales, UK
Rather than attack the tobacco company (who are obviously going to do everything they can to sell their legal product) or the greedy smoker, why don't we put the blame for this ludicrous settlement where it rightly belongs? The jury who made such a ridiculous award. Gill, UK
The link between smoking and cancer has been public knowledge for some thirty years. One might have sympathy for a cancer sufferer who started smoking before that time in ignorance of the risks but who then stopped when the dangers became known.
However, to have continued smoking in wilful disregard for your health and then to sue the company providing you with the means of bringing about your own death is the action of a pathetic individual too weak to take control of his own life.
I personally abhor both smoking and tobacco companies but the manufacture of cigarettes is not yet illegal and the smoking of them is not compulsory. If you gamble and lose - tough.
Pat, England
This award represents the death of common sense more than anything else Stephen Kenney,
USA
It makes a mockery of the jury trial system. We've had more than ample reason since the early 1960's to understand that smoking is hazardous. This case shouldn't have even been allowed to go to trial let alone grant such an award. This award represents the death of common sense more than anything else. When we start to award stupidity, there will be no end to the cost for there is no shortage of stupidity in the world.
Stephen Kenney,
USA
It is ok to fine the company by such a large amount, but why should the first man who successfully sues, get all that money? Will there be any left for subsequent victims. Giving all that money to one man who abused his health is ludicrous, and shows the unfairness of our judicial system.
Andy Mitchell,
UK
If smoking is so dangerous and so addictive that damages of $3billion are warranted then where do the governments stand who permit cigarette sales and who join in the profits from such sales? A touch of hypocrisy there, I would say!
David,
Spain
I am a non-smoker and I personally cannot believe the ridiculous amount of compensation awarded in this case! How can anyone living in the USA claim to have been unaware of the risks of smoking? The man is still smoking now!!! The tobacco companies should be punished but now people are aware of the risks, it is up to them to quit.
Matt,
UK
If a man who consciously smoked cigarettes can be awarded $3bn, it surely goes to show how much non-smokers could justifiably claim if they contracted tobacco-related cancers due to passive smoking.
Paul R, UK
The tobacco industry is pretty despicable but we need them Malcolm McMahon, York, UK
The danger is that this kind of thing might lead to "back door" prohibition, making it impossible for a legal tobacco industry to continue to exist and leaving organised crime to take over. This would be a major disaster for the whole of our civil society. How to turn half of our population into criminals overnight.
The tobacco industry is pretty despicable but we need them.
Malcolm McMahon, York, UK
The smoker is irrelevant to the punitive damages in this case. What is on trial is the behaviour over 50 years of tobacco companies who hid what they knew on the additive properties of nicotine and the risks to health, then cynically marketed their products to young and impressionable people to get them hooked. For that crime, no punishment is too severe.
Andy Millward,
UK
Similar things have happened before. They'll appeal and probably win. Either way, will $3bn really stop what tobacco companies get up to. There is still too much money made by an industry that only causes suffering in the long run. If the money ever does get paid out, lets hope it's the end for the tobacco company. But don't pay out to one person, give it to health services to pay for smoking related health care.
James, UK
If the US can justify payments like this to someone who must have been on another planet to miss the health warnings, maybe I could sue the US for promoting greenhouse gases and destroying the environment I live in.
James P, UK
If this is what it takes to put big tobacco out of business, then yes its justified. These companies have made megabucks from selling a product which kills its users. They are peddling an addictive and harmful drug, and have consistently lied about the impact of smoking over many years. I hope that this is but the first of many such awards. Eileen, UK
The money would be better spent promoting cigarette dangers in the Third World
Joanne, Netherlands (ex UK)
I do agree with the idea that those who smoked before warnings were made public about cigarettes should be compensated. But by all accounts this man smoked for several years after the warnings came to light. I can't believe that he managed to live in the health conscious state of California and not see or hear of the dangers of smoking. So in this case I don't think he deserves the payout. Certainly tobacco companies have a lot to answer for but to hand over to this man $3 billion is ridiculous. The money would be better spent promoting cigarette dangers in the Third World countries where the tobacco companies are selling their products without restrictions.
Joanne, Netherlands (ex UK)
In the last 24 hours I have drunk alcohol and coffee. I have taken antihistamine and I have eaten junk food with more fat and chemicals in it than I care to know about.
I drive a car and play sport. All these things have risk attached to them, and I accept these risks in the knowledge that it is my choice. Cigarette manufacturers are not morally wrong in producing cigarettes any more than the producers of the products above are. Your choice is your responsibility and no one else's.
Tom, UK
I'm a 20-a-day smoker who fully realizes the risk. The lawyer who won this one for his client must be a genius! How can a bloke from the state that gave us airbags and catalytic converters, be unaware of the health risks? More to the point, how did the jury believe him? Total madness!
Alistair Currah, U.K.
Clearly appropriate. How could he possibly have known the risks? They were a closely guarded secret, known only to those capable of reading the large warnings on the side of every packet and across the bottom of every advertising hoarding.
That said, I do enjoy seeing the big tobacco companies being given a kicking. They've been so underhand in so many ways that they deserve everything they get.
Guy Chapman, UK
I don't feel particularly sorry for the smokers or the tobacco companies. Any payouts should go to fund the additional burden on the health service and to compensate passive smokers, as they did not choose to smoke, but can still suffer.
Thomas Bailey,
Russia
Something else that is too often overlooked is the fact that the cynical tobacco companies are now heavily promoting tobacco use in developing countries. They know that smoking is a proven major contributor to many forms of disease, but they are happy to boost profits by promoting their deadly product among the, as yet, ill-informed. This surely is institutional evil.
Dan Pattimore,
UK
The only people who will get rich are the lawyers.
Philip, USA
Nothing to get excited about. It's just another California jury trying to break a world record. The State of California already has it's billions in tobacco judgements; they won't jeopardise their cash cow. The award will be reduced dramatically and the whole case appealed. The only people who will get rich are the lawyers on both sides who have several years more work. Great job security.
Philip Grebner,
USA
This judgment is terrible. The ill effects of using tobacco have been known for at least 150 years. Long before warning ever went on packages, cigarettes were called "coffin nails" and "cancers sticks". To claim that one did not know the health risks involved is patently ridiculous. Furthermore, no one forced this man to start smoking. He did it of his own accord. Why then, should tobacco companies be punished for keeping a customer?
Joshua H.,
USA
The damage award is ludicrous in the extreme.
Bill, UK Yes, the tobacco companies are wrong and yes smokers are foolish (and I'm one of them), but which ordinary persons life is worth 3 billion dollars? If war pensions ran at that level, every country in the world would be bankrupt. What ordinary working person could hope to amass that amount in ten lifetimes? The damage award is ludicrous in the extreme.
Bill Templeton,
United Kingdom
Phillip Morris owes this poor legally duped man $1.00 in damages and perhaps a free ticket to a NASCAR race. The smoker has full personal responsibility for using a legal product at his own risk. This product that has a health warning, required by U.S. law, printed on each pack of cigarettes for the past some 35 years. No one has been lying to anyone; those that have continued to smoke bear the full brunt of the consequences for their actions, not the manufacturers.
John Groth,
USA
Why give all that money to one man? Why not donate it to scientific research for the cure and prevention of cancer-if he is getting this much compensation, what do the victims of concentration camps deserve who were UNWILLINGLY put at risk?
David ,
UK
The ruling is unjust and the award stretches the boundaries of incredulity! Just as ignorance of the law is deemed as an invalid defence, how in heavens name can ignorance of the fact that "sticking burning leaves in your mouth and inhaling the fumes" has an associated health risk be deemed as a valid prosecution?
Ed,
England
Speaking as a smoker, we know it might kill us.
Mat, UK
Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you. You don't have to be a doctor! Speaking as a smoker, we know it might kill us but we do it anyway because we love it and that's the chance we take, if we are going to set a precedent of suing companies that sell products hazardous to health then we could just as easily be starting on McDonalds, General Motors, Nescafe, Budweiser, Nokia, Smirnoff, BP or perhaps even the BBC for their TV channels that can damage our eyes! Come on, we are all grown ups, you pay your money you take your choice. End of the story.
Mat,
UK
I am a great believer in free will. Just because the tobacco companies make a product that is bad for you, doesn't make them morally evil. No one is placing the cigarettes into the mouths of smokers apart from the smokers themselves. The tobacco companies provide the product - but consumption is a personal choice. It's about time people started accepting responsibility for their own actions.
Dean,
Uk
Yes, it is excessive. I have no sympathy with either the smoker or the company. If you are stupid enough to suck filthy smoke into your lungs, then your genes should be taken out of the gene pool as quickly as possible. But, OK, the guys dying. Is he dying BECAUSE he smokes? You can't prove that - smoking only increases the chance of catching cancer. Perhaps a token meal at McDonalds should be enough, and the tax on cigarettes should be increased 1000% each year until nobody can afford to smoke anymore!
Alain,
England
Both parties are equally responsible.
CM, New Zealand
I think that both parties are equally responsible. The smoker is ultimately responsible for his or her own health, but multinational tobacco companies still refuse to accept that smoking is damaging to your health. In addition, the addictive element does take a certain amount of control away from the smoker and as I understand it, the addictive element is added; it's not a natural component of tobacco.
CM,
New Zealand
I think if someone is clever enough to realise that they can go to court to get money from a tobacco company they are clever enough to realise that smoking kills. People who smoke make a sacrifice for pleasure. If someone jumps in front of a car to save a child from being run down does he sue the car company for making cars? It's silly the money could be better spent on a good cause!
Giffo,
Scotland
I feel so sorry for all those tobacco firm chief executives and shareholders! After years of peddling a lethal product they've been caught. They are lucky to get away with a fine. It's just unfortunate they can't be tried for murder. The magnitude of the evil being carried out by these companies cannot and must not be underestimated. Blaming the individual smoker is ludicrous.
Spence,
U.K
How about greedy self centred parasites in motor sport and elsewhere happy to take tobacco advertising money irrespective of the cost in human life terms? How about Governments around the world eager to take blood money from smokers in the form of ever increasing taxes? No wonder it is so difficult to get tobacco advertising banned!
Mike,
UK
...squeeze them for every penny.
Sam, England
Of course the man knew smoking was bad for him and of course he should get the money. The only way to strike a decisive blow to the death merchants is to squeeze them for every penny they've ever earned. Just because tobbaco buisness is legal doesn't mean it's morally right. In Hitler's Germany the persecution and annihilation of Jews was legal. I say bankrupt the blighters.
Sam,
England
It is not only excessive, it is wrong! What ever happened to personal responsibility? In the 1800s cigarettes were known as coffin nails. You hear that expression used in World War II movies, everyone with a brain knows tobacco is harmful. This all about lawyers attempting to drive a legal business out of business so they can make large amounts of money.
Richard T. Ketchum,
USA
Although I believe that the tobacco companies should be held accountable, I think the size of this settlement makes a dangerous precedent. Court settlements have been skyrocketing out of control for years in the US, and the size the action will only drive them higher. As other industries feel the effects of this precedent, who will be able to afford the cost of doing business in the US?
Kyle,
Canada
Just how much more warning does a smoker need?
Nanette, UK
I have just read through a selection of comments. Nobody has made the comment that if governments actively banned smoking; smokers would be up in arms about their "right" being violated. The tobacco company is right - this makes a travesty of the American system of justice. Just how much more warning does a smoker need?
Nanette Bray,
UK
It's quite right that the tabacco industry is made to pay, but surely not to one single individual! It would be more fitting if this money were paid into cancer research. That way all of us might benefit.
Jamie,
Germany
Although $3bn is far more than any one person needs to live on, the key point is that these are punitive damages. A tobacco giant would simply shrug off a fine in the order of millions, and then continue to do business in the way it always has.
This is an industry that has suppressed research proving the dangers of smoking, and is making significant inroads in developing countries through aggressive and irresponsible marketing. The sooner they have to start paying some of their ill-gotten gains out the better.
John Kearney,
UK
If anyone should be compensated it should be the victims of passive smoking
Miss Evans, UK
As far as I see it, smokers are all too aware of the dangers, but for some reason choose to ignore them. I believe payments of this kind to be completely unfair. If anyone should be compensated it should be the victims of passive smoking. Miss Evans, UK
Smokers are wholly to be blamed for risking their health. Everyone knows that smoking is hazardous to health. Every tobacco advertisement comes with a warning message, even on the packs. The tobacco companies a abiding by the law. And in that case the law is to be blamed.
Mohammad Ali Asif,
Saudi Arabia/ Pakistan
This sounds like a government conspiracy. Force a highly profitable company to pay a dying man $3 billion.
Then with a 50% or so inheritance tax watch the US government collect upon the man's death. Of course the figure is over the top, it's incredibly irresponsible and risky to pay such sums to one individual.
Jack, UK
While I don't have a lot of sympathy for the tobacco company, I really can't see how this guy can claim he wasn't warned that smoking was bad for him. He claims that until the mid 90s he was unaware of the harm he was doing himself. Sounds pretty unlikely to me, unless he was on a desert island, with no TV, no newspapers and lots of cigarette machines. Rob, UK
Anyone got a light?
I want to get rich and never work again.
And die early.
What a ridiculous state of affairs - just as the American compensation culture couldn't get any worse, this happens! How long before the floods of claims start?
So what's he going to do with his $3 billion? Sad.
Fraser, Essex, England
I am not a smoker but feel there are two sides to the argument. People who took up smoking in the last thirty years would have to be fools for saying they weren't aware of the dangers of smoking.
But you have to wonder at the cigarette companies who still produce millions of cigarettes knowing the possible consequences of their product.
If juries want to award squillions in damages give it to the health services who have to treat these people who become ill from cancer because of their smoking.
Peter Haslett, Australia
This is ludicrous. Where has this guy been living for the last 30 years? In a darkened room with cigarettes fed to him under the door so he couldn't read the warnings?
Yes smoking is a "bad" thing, but so is a legal system that encourages "victim" culture to prosper. Its not impossible to give up smoking, people should take responsibility for their own actions.
Finally, if the tobacco companies are so evil that $3bn punitive damages need to be awarded against them, how come tobacco isn't illegal? Oh yeah, it makes government too much money. The hypocrisy is breathtaking. David Evans, UK
What I question more is how can any country's government (in this case that of the US) justify allowing the continued open and legal sale of such a product after a verdict like this ?
Richard, UK
How much money can you say compensates for one life? No matter what the figure is though, these companies have made vast amounts of money from selling dangerous and addictive products for decades. It's time they started to pay out for the damage they cause.
Mark, UK
Cigarette companies have known for decades that their products were harmful to people's health. Suppressing this information they blithely continued to manufacture their products, marketing them as lifestyle enhancing items, and fashion accessories. If our governments won't ban the sale of tobacco products completely, despite the weight of medical opinion, then bankrupting them might be the only viable alternative.
And what's $3 billion in punitive damages versus years of suffering under an addiction that slowly steals your life? Barry OS, Ireland
Let's face it, the smoker will have died before a single cent ever got into his bank account. Even then the $3bn may never be paid as it will go through the appeal courts for a long time yet. But I think the amount is right as it points out that American tobacco companies can't play with people's lives by lying about the facts of their products when they knew they were not true - they should be severely punished for that mistake.

Sierra Leone - time to forgive and forget?
For lasting peace to ensue the seed of forgiveness and love must be sown now. We need to start real living from somewhere.Oa Olaitan, The Gambia
Despite the fact that we are so hungry for peace and cessation of the killings and the mutilations, these men have to pay the price for killing and mutilating the hands and legs of innocent citizens.Abdoul Kamara, Canada

Sierra Leone - time to forgive and forget?
Yes
No
Background Â¦ Vote Â¦ Your reaction Â¦ Have your say The Background:
The civil war in Sierra Leone has left over 50,000 dead, 100,000 people mutilated and more than 2 million people displaced by fighting.
Now a peace deal has been struck, under which the rebel forces will disarm and receive senior posts in government. Human rights groups say the deal effectively rewards the rebels for taking up arms and committing atrocities. Others argue that major compromises are necessary to bring an end to eight years of fighting. What do you think? Was the UN wrong to broker a deal that includes such a wide-ranging amnesty? Can such bitter opponents work together in building a better future for the people of Sierra Leone?
Is it time to forgive and forget?
Background Â¦ Vote Â¦ Your reaction Â¦ Have your say Your Reaction:
We are looking for lasting peace in that small tortured country. So far after years of fighting and killing we can't still solve the problems. The best solution is to forgive and forget for a new Sierra Leone! Sallieu Kanu, Austria
The only people that have the right to forgive and forget are the ones with hands, legs cut off, because they are the one that will keep the pain for the rest of their lives. So let them choose if they want Sankoh and his butchers or not.Billy B, Beirut
My house has been burnt and my family has been killed by the absent minded people and I was totally raped by the rebels. I will never forgive or forget about it till I die. I will always pray for them.Fatmata Adams, USA
Although the atrocities committed by the RUF were hideous to all civilised people it is more important to focus on the future than the past. At least now Sierra Leone actually has a future to look forward to.Thomas Mohr, Ireland
Civil wars in Africa are distinguished by their brutality. The war in Sierra Leone is marked by sheer brutality and senseless carnage, especially on the part of the so-called rebels.
Is it too much to ask that these senseless, drugged, power-hungry louts face the full force of the law? Because of their insatiable appetite for the gory, a generation of Sierra Leoneans will grow up sans feet or arms. Some liberation fighters, indeed!Kofi Ellison, Ghana/USA
President Kabba has unintentionally signed his own death sentence by succumbing to pressure to grant blanket amnesty to terrorist murderers. The RUF will be doing exactly what the rebels did in Guinea Bissau. Just look at the similarity of their demands and you need not look any further.Mohamed Savage, Australia
No one feels the real pain of what happened in Sierra Leone except those people that had their hands and legs cut off, because they will keep feeling the pain till they die. Nido Peppel, Lebanon
Sankor and his henchmen should not be allowed to get away with it. As soon as anyone of them set foot on European soil, they should be arrested and charged with genocide and violation of human rights. We will do a 'Pinochet' on them.Arnold Gordon, UK
Kabba should get the blame for all these problems, running away and leaving his people to die.Gerald Cline-Cole
The evil that men do will leave after them. So let us pray for peace in Sierra-Leone. The time will come for all those who are responsible for all these acts against humans, and children in Sierra-Leone. Mr Foday Sankoh and your men I wish you best of luck. Momodu Kamara, USA
It is a shame on the international community to sacrifice political decency for its inaction in the Sierra Leone crisis. They have only papered over the cracks. The atrocities in Sierra Leone are intolerable and unforgivable.Alim Sesay, USA
Forgive and forget! It is easier said than done, after all what we've been through the past eight years. Do you think it will be easy for us to forget? Even though we were not in the country for the war, it did affect us a great deal. Do you know how much lives and properties have been destroyed by these so-called freedom fighters yet they want us to forgive and forget. It will take a lot more than words to convince me to visit that country let alone go back to work with people that I know for sure will never appreciate whatever contribution you give as long as it will not put millions in their pockets personally.Benjamin Johnson, UK
Those who said killing and mutilation were the solutions to our social, economic, tribal and political problems have no right to rush us into forgiving them. We have our own ways of doing things and we will decide when we no why they did what they did and on whose behalf. As for forgetting you and your actions, do not even think of that. Sierra Leone will still be talking of you a hundred years from now.Mohamed S P Koker, UK
Let's have a new beginning in Sierra Leone but this should tempered with respect, value of life and understanding the predicament of "the other Sierra Leonean".Samual M Conteh, USA
Any joker with a gun can start a war but it takes a real man to make peace. Lets all hope that real men have signed the peace accord. We must forgive and forget to be able to live a normal life. War sucks.Sayborne Kamara, USA
Now that there is "peace" and cessation of killings, mutilations, looting and rapingï¿½what has the rebel leader and his disciples have to say and give the hungry and sick they have left behind? J B Boachie, USA
These rebels burned down my family house and destroyed my identity. I will never forget and my the almighty God visit them for me.Jess Lawson, USA
I am not sure that it is correct to credit the UN with brokering the deal. It seems to me that much more credit is owed to Africans themselves for developing a regional solution. That issue aside, it was of course proper to include such a wide-ranging amnesty. Given the relative strength of the opponents, the war could have gone on for many more years. Making such allowances was regretfully a necessary evil to end the conflict. The opponents will either see the necessity of this course of action or continue to fight. This would be a tragedy given that since neither side could force an unconditional victory or surrender, they must eventually return to negotiations; negotiations that will include such unsavoury conditions as amnesty. Be wise forgive, but do not forget. Choose and build a peace.John Pritchett, USA
The people of Sierra have always been kind and peace-loving people. They do not deserve what has happened to them. However, what else can be done to stop these cruel deeds of which mostly it is the poor people are affected. Peace must be accepted at all cost and I believe that the government of Sierra Leone had no choice but to accept the peace deal.P Michael, Ireland
It's a crazy joke to even think about forgiving let alone consider forgetting what these barbarians
with their destructive revolution did to our beloved people and country. The sight of stumps on children in particular will forever stay with us. Those who committed these crimes should be punished and not rewarded. May God bless the children of Sierra Leone.M.Yongawo, Sierra Leonean, UK
I think people need a sense of reparation in order to begin to try and forgive, and move on. The examples of Rwanda, Yugoslavia where there was no attempt to address previous injustices show that these resentments remain simmering only to resurface another day. Amolo, USA
History is bound to repeat itself if we forget what has happened. The logical thing to do would be to learn whatever it is that we can learn from such horrific chapter in Africa and Sierra Leone's history, welcome peace and move on.
Bereket Asefaw, Canada
We Sierra Leoneans are too ready to bury our heads in the sand. That is what has led directly to today's problems. Pretending that the atrocities did not happen will not make them go away. Many of us fled our homeland to live in the West because we believed that the Rule of Law applied more than it did in our country. How dare we, from our comfy chairs now tell those who have suffered to "forgive and forget"? It is an insult.
Ade Daramy, England
It has happened and what has been done can never be undone. The only thing we as Sierra Leoneans have to do is to forgive them but we will never forget. We need to forgive and move on with our lives and try, hope and pray that S/L will be a better place, a place where we will call home once again.
Onikeh, USA
Bravo to the peace accord! But Sankoh and his henchgang should never be trusted.They are still thirsty for power and diamonds. They will never lay down all their cards on the table. People can forgive but should never forget. AG Jalloh, USA
Every time that I think my life is difficult or I'm depressed, I think about the Sierra Leonean refugees I met in Guinea with hands, ears, arms and legs hacked off. How do you forgive those that did these horrible things to another person for whatever reasons? How can I forget what I saw and what they told me? If it's that way for me, an American, how is it for the Sierra Leoneans that have suffered so much through this brutal campaign?Kevin A. Urban, Senegal
For lasting peace to ensue the seed of forgiveness and love must be sown now. We need to start real living from somewhere.Oa Olaitan, The Gambia
If we are going to forgive and forget the incidents in Sierra Leone, then why can't we forget and forgive Bosnia, Rwanda and other places where people were killed and tortured for nothing? The people responsible in Sierra Leone should be punished. They (the criminals) might think the time will not come to face their sins.Tewaney Ayalneh, USA
I think everyone should forget and forgive about what happen in Sierra Leone, because we should concentrate on rebuilding our country, and making sure people have a better life chance. Isatu Sesay, UK
An amnesty is the right way to proceed although I am not sure that rewarding murderers with government posts is. Perhaps the amnesty would be better received if this perk were removed and replaced with a bar on taking part in public life for a specified number of years.GS, UK
The people of Sierra Leone can forgive but they will never forget. They have no choice they have to learn to live with those people (EX-REBELS). Those that are responsible should not go free. The international body should help to bring those people to justice. May God bless Sierra Leone and its people again so that they can live as brothers and sisters. May God help us all. The rest of the world put the past of the Germans behind them, but they never forget. Williams, Sierra Leone living in Norway
It is very difficult to be happy about the peace treaty that has been signed between the government of Sierra Leone and the rebel movement headed by Mr. Foday Sankoh.
After eight years of the most vicious and barbaric war aged anywhere on the African continent, there is no doubt that many people will welcome the peace. However, the real question that we must ask ourselves, is peace at what price? The fact is the price is justice. Moreover, without justice there can never be any real peace. We can forgive but we cannot forget if there is no justice.Francis Stevens George, Norway
It is possible to forgive but it is not possible to forget. More important is that people honestly examine why it happened and what can be done that this carnage does not happen again. Otherwise there will come again a revenge tribal war just like in Rwanda and Burundi. Mrs. Ute Norman, Togo
Are you telling me that 10,000 lives are worthless. As we say in krio God go pay foday sankoh
he and all his goons will die an ugly death. Let them enter Freetown and let them see what they have done. Yet they are rewarded with our diamonds. I guess African lives are not worth those of Kosovars. We are Africans, so we are worthless.James Williams, Sierra Leonean
The RUF has now succeeded in terrorising the people of Sierra Leone into submission, just like Charles Taylor did in Liberia. If violent take-overs of countries were limited to elites killing and slashing one another in coups and counter-coups to gain access to national treasuries one could live with it. We've had that for years. This new method of literally butchering the populace into submission is a new dimension of evil in the name of politics. President Kabbah should be ashamed of himself for giving in to these bandits. All of civil society in West Africa will rue this day. Get ready for rebel movements of a new kind. Does Kabbah think that these bandits are going to actually settle for half the pie when the have cowed him into even allowing them into government? Death or dismemberment is not the worst that can happen to the residents of Sierra Leone; having RUF in government is.Ibezim Okehie, USA
First, you question assumes that the RUF was the only group that committed atrocities. That is not the fact. The Kamajors, Kapras, ECOMOG etc. have all done their bit. Go back and check your reporting on this war and you will find out these atrocities did not happen until 1996 when the ethnic militia was introduced to the conflict. Frankly, Sierra Leoneans are ready to move on with their lives. Why don't you, BBC and UN, who are talking of war crimes allow us to do that. LONG LIVE PEACE TO SIERRA LEONE.Safroko, USA
No, despite the fact that we are so hungry for peace and cessation of the killings and the mutilations, these men have to pay the price for killing and mutilating the hands and legs of innocent citizens. As far as I am concerned this is rewarding whomever have the ability to kill his/her brother. This is not justice, this is a precedent that Mr. Kabbah and his group have set, for the next disgruntled soldier. Whatever they agreed upon, these killings are not going to stop. All those have committed these crimes should be brought to justice.Abdoul Kamara, Canada
Even in a time of war, there are ethics and laws, and those who violate them should be held accountable. Every effort should be made to achieve peace in Sierra Leone, but the peace must be a sustainable one and it should not set a precedent which might invite others to try and topple the government in such a ruthless, brutal and inhuman way with incentives such as broad amnesty and government posts. Those who have committed grave atrocities should not be rewarded and given the power to make or influence decisions affecting the population they have terrorised in the most unimaginable ways. It sickens me to think that such heinous deeds as have been committed in Sierra Leone would go unpunished.Alma, USA
For now, let the rebels be cajoled to lay down their arms. In fact, the UN should move in quickly to disarm all the factions minus ECOMOG. By this, there will be a level playing field for all and then they will be prosecuted for crimes against humanity. If there is a blanket amnesty and supported by the UN then we could say that the UN is not neutral when it comes to the black race. All the ring leaders should be pursued and placed among the wanted list with Milosevic and others. No country should harbour them.This will be a deterrent to others that they can never be paid for killing innocent people. Let the UN move in now to disarm the rebels as they are doing now in Kosovo.
We have seen enough of Kosovo but the world has not seen Sierra Leone yet. I am appealing to the international media to move to Sierra Leone.Thank you BBC for allowing some of us to vote on this important issue.We want peace for Sierra Leone but not pieces.
Henry Williams, Sierra Leone, living in Canada
No matter the outcome justice must be attained under all cost. Peace in the atmosphere without justice served in the mind would always be vaporized within the populace.
Max, USA
War does not produce any good future but poverty and hardship; it doesn't matter where you live or what you do for a living. Let us all forgive and turn to another page to rebuild our beloved country Sierra Leone.
Alex Kamara, USA
Human rights abuses would decrease significantly if these criminals thought they could be brought before justice. Now that we have a certain momentum of prosecuting war criminals achieved it would be a pity to stop. Karim Moukaddem, Spain
Outrageous!!! Rebels who torture the people
like that don't stand for the people but for themselves.
They should be tried like criminals, even serial killers. They don't deserve recognition in the political circle.
Dagmawi WodleAregay, USA
Those rabels that actuallly committed crimes against humanity should be prosecuted and sent to prison or they should set up some kind of truth commission to investigate the culprits and then ban them from participating in politics and they should not allow them to leave the country. Julius Bankole, USA
Too many people have died in Sierra Leone. So for the sake of the children, the living and and for posterity we need to have peace now, after 8 years of a brutal war that has paralysed every aspect of the country. Mohamed Khalil Kanu, USA
The International Court should deal with the RUF for the atrocities committed to civilians. I vote NO.
Rosemond Jones, UK
It is going to be extremely difficult to convict individuals of war crimes beyond reasonable doubt. Secondly, some of us had long had reliable eye witness reports from family members accusing all sides in the conflict of horribe crimes like summary executions, rapes, and amputations. Finally, the UN should not be making such irresponsible statements like rejecting the amnesty provision, when the UN has never and will more than likely, never provide any military protection for our defenseless people if the war continues. The UN does not value Sierra Leonean lives like those in Bosnia and Kosovo. Patrick Bockari, USA
If peace is to be made possible people must be prepared to forgive each other no matter how bad the crimes were. Without forgiveness there will never be peace. And this does not mean to incourage violation of human rights. In Sierra Leone the rebels came out of the bush because there was a prospect for peace. That goodwill should not be betrayed on the pretext of war criminality. Had the rebels been defeated it would be proper to punish them for war crimes. Searching for war crimes among the rebels will jeopardise peace and prospects for peace in other parts of the world where there are conflicts will be doomed. Forgiveness is the proper way of restoring peace in Sierra Leone.
S M Sanka, Tanzania
No one can forget this nasty episode of Sierra Leone history in a hurry. And for those who actually got the raw deal, I doubt they will ever be able to forgive and forget. But to assuage their pains, some respnsibility must be borne by the perpetrators. A blanket amnesty is likely to cause further social problems a little way down the road. Remember, (for those who have seen, or know, or can empathise) Sierra Leone will never be the same again. I am glad the UN seems to have swallowed its words about war crimes. Amnesty, yes, but crimes against humanity shold not go unpunished. Otherwise where will justice be? Will it have to mean rewarding people for crimes against humanity? What example will it set? If another group emerges and does the same thing, will it also be treated the same? Would we ever be able to restore the Rule of Law?
Arthur Abraham, Sierra Leone
Letting rebels who've commited all those crimes go free is surely showing them that they can get away with such despicable acts, and of course stands in stark contrast to the way the UN or the West is going after Yugoslav war criminals. If the UN is going to be involved to show that it remains commited to all people then it should really act so, and send in troops or reinforce the ones that are already there, and it should not have double standards in the way it deals with victims and their agressors. It is really disapointing, I dont know who to blame, the human race? the white race? With all these past and present known facts of racism, the UN and everyone else continues to commit them hypocritically. Wondi, Ethiopia, living in USA
You can forgive, but I don't think anyone will forget all the terrible things that happened in Sierra Leone.
Elizabeth, USA
While people debate giving amnesty to the rebels there are other parties that seem to have escaped unnoticed: the Canadian & UK mining companies that invested millions in supplying arms & military advisors to reinstall the government have yet to answer for their role. Is prolonging a civil war, in a foreign country, for financial gain, not a crime? Chandler, Canada
Whether people decide to forgive and forget is a personal decision each person should make on their own. The peace deal in any case must be welcomed because with the international
community unwilling to help, militarily as they did in Kosovo there was really no choice. The war had become unwinnable and the suffering of the people had to be brought to an end.
But it is not enough for the RUF to be held responsible. The actual individuals involved in crafting and executing this devilish policy of mass amputations must be brought to justice. Then and only then can a decision be made to forgive and forget. If these crimes are allowed to go unaddressed they are sure to be repeated, if not in Sierra Leone then somewhere else in the world.
Mambu Kawa, USA

Wiggins is in the midst of a month off competition in 2006
Bradley Wiggins believes he is in the form of his life and remains on target to pick up the Tour de France's prestigious yellow jersey in July.
The 25-year-old is among the favourites to win the Tour prologue on 1 July and lead cycling's blue-riband event.
He told BBC Sport: "The start to my season couldn't have gone any better.
"The difference between winning the yellow jersey and ending fifth will be minute but, as it stands, I'm a match for any of the top time triallers."
The Cofidis rider faces major competition in his bid to win the 7km Tour opener in Strasbourg from, among others, countryman David Millar, who will be competing in his first road race since serving his two-year drug ban.
Millar already has past experience of prologue success and donning the yellow jersey, which Wiggins confessed would be useful to learn from.
I will never go down the drugs route whatever the pressure or expectation
Bradley Wiggins
"Sadly I'll be one of Dave's rivals so I don't think he's going to be giving me loads of advice about how to beat him!" said Wiggins. "That said, we've chatted about the Tour opener.
"It's great for British cycling especially with the Tour starting in London next year. That'll give it all the hype needed - especially if we manage a Brit one-two in Strasbourg.
"It's unprecedented for British cycling and one can only hope it launches a fresh generation of world-class riders coming through the ranks."
While the Olympic champion - he won gold on the track in Athens - admits he is a strong candidate for early Tour glory, he has ruled out being the next Lance Armstrong or competing for overall honours in the race.
But in his Tour preparation so far this season, Wiggins has ridden Paris-Nice and Paris-Roubaix.
In the former - his season opener - he was seventh in the prologue and just five seconds off the pace, while he was comfortably in the top 50 of the notoriously tough Paris-Roubaix.
"I could have gone with the eventual winners at Paris-Roubaix," he added, "but I thought 'what's the point in taking the risk?' when it wasn't one of my season goals. I decided to save myself for the Tour."
WIGGINS 2006 SEASON
5-12 March: Paris-Nice (71st overall; seventh in prologue)
9 April: Paris-Roubaix (49th)
3-7 May: Four days of Dunkirk
12-14 May: Tour of Picardie
4-11 June: Dauphine Libere
1-23 July: Tour de France
He is now in the midst of a month off racing before his Tour build-up takes shape with the Four days of Dunkirk from 3 May followed by the Tour of Picardie and the Dauphine Libere.
Despite admitting the pressure mounting with the Tour de France being his "be all and end all" of his season, he insisted he would never turn to drugs in a sport that has repeatedly been overshadowed by doping.
He said: "I will never go down the drugs route whatever the pressure or expectation. I'll do what I can as a rider, no more.
"As for the pressure of winning the prologue, that's the sort of stuff I thrive on - it's no different to the Olympics.
"You feel more sick than you ever have in your life but then you achieve your goal and it's all worthwhile."
Away from the road, Wiggins still retains track goals, most notably defending his Olympic individual pursuit gold in Beijing and subsequently making it a hat-trick of golds on home soil in 2012.
"I've had that mapped up since I was 12," he revealed. "That may sound scary to some people but having it all laid out relaxes me.
"I know what I'm doing from now until 2012 - I'm not kidding. I can turn to my schedule and say, 'right, I'm doing that in January 2010'.
"It makes me sound like a control freak but it keeps me on course for the bigger picture and the ultimate prizes of my career."
That quest gets under way again in Dunkirk on 3 May.
