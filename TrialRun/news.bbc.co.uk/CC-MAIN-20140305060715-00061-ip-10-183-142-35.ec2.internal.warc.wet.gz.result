Japan looks back on 17th-Century persecutions
By Duncan Bartlett
BBC News, Tokyo
An engraving of Nikolao Keian, one of the martyrs being remembered on Monday
Enlarge Image Christians from all over Japan have gathered for a ceremony in Nagasaki to honour 187 people who were killed as a consequence of their faith during the 17th Century.
Roman Catholics maintain that the campaign against Christianity which took place in Japan in the early 1600s was more ferocious than any other religious persecution in the history of the Church.
They estimate that tens of thousands of Japanese Christians were put to death, many after being tortured.
During that period, Japan's shogunate rulers were attempting to unify the country and repel foreigners. They expelled missionaries from Spain and Portugal who had won many converts, especially in western Japan. Christianity was regarded as a malevolent influence on Japanese affairs.
In the early part of the 17th Century, an attempt was made to eradicate Christianity altogether.
At the time there were approximately 400,000 Catholics and many who did not renounce their faith were killed. Crucifixion and burning at the stake were common forms of execution.
Women and children
At the ceremony organised by the Roman Catholic Church in Nagasaki on Monday, 187 people who were killed between 1603 and 1639 were beatified, as well as a Japanese priest by the name of Julian Nakaura who was put to death in the late 15th Century.
Many Japanese people today will find it difficult to understand why the martyrs gave up their lives
Father Paul Miki Murakami
Beatification is sometimes regarded as a step on the path to sainthood, although in this case the church says its primary aim is to commemorate the sacrifice of the martyrs. Similar ceremonies have taken place periodically in Japan over the past 150 years.
The service in Nagasaki followed historical research which uncovered new details of the Christians who died during the 17th Century.
They included people from all over Japan and from all levels of society, including lay people and priests, women and children, commoners and samurai.
Decline
Father Paul Miki Murakami, a Roman Catholic priest in Tokyo, says: "Many Japanese people today will find it difficult to understand why the martyrs gave up their lives, but these were in a sense a spiritual elite.
Few Japanese today describe themselves as Christian
"Japan remains a spiritual country in some ways, but during the economic boom period of the 1960s and 1970s, many people turned from religion and began to focus more on money and secular matters. They believed a strong economy would make them happy and turned into economic animals."
Father Murakami believes this is one reason why membership of the Catholic Church has declined among native Japanese in recent decades, although it has been strengthened by an influx of foreigners from Korea and the Philippines.
Less than 1% of Japanese people define themselves as Christian. Most subscribe to Buddhism or the traditional faith of Shinto, although those who profess deep religious convictions are rare and it is usually regarded as impolite to talk about religion with strangers.

Obama healthcare reforms may pay off for drug firms
By Richard Hemming
Business reporter, BBC News
US health reforms may mean an increase in prescription drug coverage
The investment community is hailing President Obama's healthcare reforms as potentially positive for the pharmaceutical industry.Sector specialists say that although the result was a triumph politically for the Obama administration, from the industry's point of view it was a "best case scenario". "US pharma appears to have fared relatively well," writes Merill Lynch's US healthcare analyst, Eric Lo. "Having a plan in place removes an overhang on the industry by providing clarity on when and where the cuts will come. "It could potentially add an additional 32 million lives with prescription drug coverage although some of this benefit will likely be offset by lower pricing," he says. Prescription pricingThe generous assessment of the impact of the reforms for drugs companies stems from the fact that they do not include the so-called public option, which would have involved the provision of public sector insurance. Had this been included, the expectation was that pharmaceutical profits would have been heavily reduced over time, as the government became the major buyer of prescription drugs, forcing reduced prices. In its current form, the bill ensures that the US government will not be the major buyer in the pharmaceutical market. Healthcare spending accounts for 16% of the US total gross domestic product, or $2.5 trillion, or $8,000 a person on 2009 data. "Critically, the pricing of prescription products remains free from external interference," says Jeremy Batstone-Carr, the head of research at Charles Stanley. The overall cost of the reforms are forecast at $940bn over 10 years, although it is likely that there will be changes to the highly contentious Healthcare Reform Bill. Key provisions in the Reform Bill are not scheduled to become effective until 2014 and between now and then additional regulations will be required. Before that year Congressional mid-term elections will be fought (which could result in a big swing to the Republican Party) and a further presidential election will take place. Minimal earnings effectThe cost of the reforms on pharmaceutical companies is forecast to be around $100bn, "and is spread over a lot of companies", according to Mr Batstone-Carr. According to the investment bank Merrill Lynch the biggest immediate cost for pharmaceutical companies will be the industry excise tax, which will total $28bn by 2019 and will commence next year. The actual earnings per share (EPS) impact he expects will be "limited" at less than -3%. The effect on each company's profits depends upon the percentage of its income that comes from government spending. For example, Merrill Lynch expects the increased industry excise tax, due to be paid by drug companies, to reduce Pfizer's earnings per share by only 1% in 2011. The drugs company generates about 35% of its revenues from the government. The investment bank expects the increased excise tax to reduce the EPS for Bristol-Myers Squibb by close to 5% in the same year. This company generates about 45% of income from the government. Share prices in UK listed pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca were both up, by 0.8% and 1.4% respectively, at lunch time on Monday. One senior corporate finance executive in the sector said that although Obama's reforms were "comprehensive" there are weaknesses due to the absence of reform in the law. A difference between German and US healthcare is that both diagnose the same number of illnesses per capita of population, but German doctors only use a fraction of the diagnostic tests to reach their conclusions. The investment banker said that this was due to American doctors being terrified of being sued if they made a mistake. Without tort, or law reform, he said, US healthcare costs would continue to remain high. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

The euro falters at first post
Nerves: Cashier talks euros, but takes liras
UK-based Italian journalist Paola Buonadonna returns to her home country to witness the birth of the euro.
Day 4, Palermo: 2 January
It's not often I'm accused of failing to spend enough money, so perhaps I should savour the moment.
The waiter brings coffee...
But the new currency in my pocket remained for the whole of yesterday a mere curiosity, without any purchasing value at all.
Palermo's main cafe, where I was sure I could buy my first cappuccino with the euro set the tone for the rest of the day.
The waiter duly asked which currency I wanted to use.
He left, came back and told me, somewhat sheepishly, that the lady at the till was feeling a little "fragile" and would I spare her nerves by paying in liras?
... and offers to take euros
When I got to the till myself I witnessed a scene worthy of Sicily's greatest playwright, Pirandello, the master of the absurd.
The cashier would recite the charge in euro, pocket the liras and inform the customer of the value of the change in euro.
Barter option
If the Ministry of the Interior had placed any hidden microphones in the cafe they would have believed the changeover a success.
Failure: No euros yet for Claudio and Marta
But not a single euro was exchanged there!
My sister and my brother-in-law, my travelling companions, remain unable to even get any euro notes out of the cash machines and are getting tired of my joke that only my British bank card has joined the single currency.
Marta is also worried about how exactly we'll pay for things and feels a return to old-fashioned barter is on the way.
"Would a chicken do for a packet of cigarettes?" she mused.
"And where does one find a chicken?"
Our good Palermitan friends Franco and Rita took us out for lunch.
Extra grace period?
They're not that worried - they think Italy will get an extra period of grace and we'll be able to use the lira for another six months.
Plastic friend: The credit card ends currency angst
It's not that they want to, you see, they just know their fellow Italians too well.
Franco had to pay by credit card in the end.
But at the end of this first, peaceful day of the new year and the new currency even Claudio, my eurosceptic brother-in-law, had a smile on his face watching the euro-celebrations on TV.
Perhaps he was thinking of what Tomasi di Lampedusa, author of the Leopard, once said about Sicily - and it applies to the rest of Italy too: Sometimes everything must change to keep things the same.

Swedish theme park ride collapses
Dozens of fun-seekers have been injured after a theme park ride collapsed in the city of Gothenburg, in western Sweden.
Officials said around 20 people were seriously hurt in the accident, which happened at the Liseberg theme park.
Several people were thrown out of the swinging Rainbow ride in Tuesday evening's accident, police said.
The ride is composed of a spinning arm with a compartment at one end which carries passengers.
The Rainbow was full, with 36 predominantly Scandinavian passengers, at the time of the accident, in which it fell about 10 feet (three metres) to the ground, police said.
The cause of the incident is under investigation.
A popular Swedish tourist destination, Liseberg is the country's biggest theme park, with more than 30 different rides.
None of the injuries are said to be life-threatening, emergency services officials told the Associated Press news agency.

Spacesuits are designed to protect the human body from the extreme conditions of space, where temperatures can range from about 135 Celsius in direct sunlight to minus 82 Celsius in areas of shadow. The spacesuit must be pressurised to protect against the near-vacuum of space, and sufficiently tough to withstand impacts from potentially lethal micrometeoroids and other orbiting debris. A fully fitted spacesuit consists of 13 layers of material nearly 9cm thick. Some key elements of the suit are: Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment [LCVG]: Spacewalking is often strenuous work, so regulating body temperature is important. The LCVG is a double-layered bodysuit containing a network of fine, water-carrying tubes. This water is pumped around the garment to remove excess heat.
Pressure Garment: This double-layered garment maintains pressure at slightly below normal atmospheric levels. Without it, body fluids would boil under the intense force produced by exposure to the zero-pressure conditions found in the near-vacuum of space.

Enlarge Image Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment [TMG]: Eight layers thick. Some consist of toughened substances such as Kevlar and protect against tiny pieces of space rock travelling at high speed.
Other layers of durable, breathable materials insulate the suit from extreme temperatures. The outer layer is made of white ortho-fabric, which helps reflect radiation. Spacesuits only offer minimal protection from radiation however, so spacewalks can only take place during periods of low solar activity.
Maximum Absorbency Garment [MAG]: Because spacewalks usually last several hours, the MAG is worn underneath the LCVG to absorb and hold urine and faeces hygienically.
Hard Upper Torso [HUT]: This is a toughened fibreglass shell to which the various "limbs" of the suit are attached, as well as the helmet assembly. It also has mountings for various instrument units and at the back - most importantly - the Life Support System. The HUT also has a holder for a rice-paper-wrapped cereal bar that astronauts can bite into in case of hunger. To avoid floating crumbs though, the whole bar must be eaten at once. Life Support System [LSS]: Worn as a "backpack", the LSS stores and regulates the oxygen supply and removes carbon dioxide breathed out via the Contaminant Control Cartridge. The LSS holds enough oxygen to last for about seven hours. Prior to walking in space, astronauts must "pre-breathe" pure oxygen to remove nitrogen from the blood and prevent painful decompression sickness. Another function is to pump cooling water around the suit and remove heat generated from both the astronaut's body and the spacesuit's various electrical systems. In-suit drink bag: Spacewalking can be thirsty work, so astronauts are provided with a 900cl water bag which is attached by Velcro to the inside of the helmet. A special valve system prevents droplets of water from escaping and floating around the helmet.
Helmet Assembly and Extravehicular Visor Assembly: The helmet assembly is a transparent poly-carbonate shell attached to the hardened upper torso. It is designed to give a very clear field of vision; the inside faceplate is also sprayed with an anti-misting agent. The visor assembly is impact-toughened and designed to reflect heat and light. The visor itself functions a little like a two-way mirror; externally tinted to restrict incoming solar glare, but allowing the astronaut a clear view from inside. Powerful lamps are fitted to the top of the helmet to enable astronauts to see into areas of shadow. These also act as a light source for the helmet-mounted TV camera which relays images back to the space shuttle's flightdeck and mission control. E-mail this to a friend

Indian suspects' remand extended
The remains of the children were found hidden in bags
A court in a suburb of the Indian capital, Delhi, has extended the remand period of two men accused of killing 17 young women and children by two days.
The businessman and his servant have been taking polygraph lie-detector tests in the western state of Gujarat. They are due in court on Friday.
The two were arrested 10 days ago after the remains of the victims were found in a sewer in the suburb of Noida.
They are being held on suspicion of multiple abduction, rape and murder.
On Wednesday, India's top investigative agency, the CBI, took charge of the probe into the killings.
More tests
A prosecution lawyer, appearing on behalf of the police, told a court in Noida that businessman Moninder Singh Pandher and his servant Surender Koli could not be physically produced before the court.
Police control angry crowds outside the house
He said the two men were undergoing more tests in a forensic laboratory in Gandhinagar, capital of the western state of Gujarat.
The two accused have been put through five days of tests, including polygraph tests for lie detection and brain mapping. They were also administered a chemical, known as "truth serum" which, experts say, leads to a state of semi-consciousness and affects a person's ability to lie.
The director of the laboratory, Dr JM Vyas, said the two men co-operated during the tests.
He said they will undergo a medical examination before they return to Noida.
The results of the tests may not be known for some more time as experts at the laboratory say they will need a few days to interpret and analyse the results.
The laboratory in Gandhinagar is one of the few in the country with the facilities for such tests.
Police say these tests will help them in their investigation and hope they will provide vital clues.
Incompetence
The crime has shocked the country and caused immense grief and public anger in Noida, especially against the police whom many accuse of negligence and dereliction of duty.
Furious residents say police failed to act over the abductions and murders because many of those reported missing came from impoverished families. The residents say that as many as 40 children have disappeared in the area over the past two years. Six Noida policemen have been sacked for alleged incompetence over the murders. Three senior officers are suspended.
Officials say that those accused of incompetence will be given an opportunity to explain their case, after which a panel will decide on further action. There has been rioting around what the press has begun to refer to as the Noida "house of horrors", with police being pelted with stones. The bar association of Noida has said none of its lawyers will defend the accused in court.

Vestey heir on city demo charge
Riot saw some of worst violence since Poll Tax protests
Police have confirmed a member of the billionaire Vestey family has been charged by officers investigating last summer's City of London riot. Mark Brown, the grandson of Sir Derek Vestey, is accused of a public order offence.
The violence that followed the Carnival Against Global Capitalism on June 18 caused more than �1 million in damage at the heart of London's financial district.
Mr Brown, 35, was charged at Bishopsgate police station with failing to give notice of a public procession.
Organisers of a public procession or march have a statutory duty to notify police of the route and numbers expected to take part.
Mr Brown, of Stoneleigh Place, Notting Hill, west London, was released on police bail and is due to appear before City of London magistrates on December 6.
Privileged upbringing
The violence in the Square Mile was the worst seen in London since the Trafalgar Square poll tax riots nine years ago.
It resulted in 28 police officers and 14 members of the public being injured.
Last month police set up an internet archive of pictures of those wanted for questioning in connection with the rioting.
Mr Brown is reported to have an income of around �44,000 a year - proceeds from a �2.7m trust fund.
His father and grandfather built the family fortune on the meat trade and Dewhurst butcher chain.
Much of the fortune - which once stood at �1bn - came from the beef the family supplied to the McDonald's hamburger chain.
But Mr Brown used his expensive education at Radley College, in Oxfordshire, and the trust fund which followed, to support a lifestyle a world away from his family's.
The public schoolboy turned eco-activist joined the UK Oil Overthrow Association and was at the forefront of action against BP, Shell and Chevron.
His environmental campaigning has also led him to work for Friends of the Earth, The Land Is Ours protest and he has links to Greenpeace.  

UK renews offer over Cyprus land
A UN-administered boundary currently separates Cyprus
Britain is "formally renewing" an offer to hand over half of its sovereign territory in Cyprus to facilitate a peace deal, the United Nations says.Britain controls 3% of territory on Cyprus, which was a UK colony until 1960 and has since seen conflict between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The renewal of the offer came as the Cypriot president Demetris Christofias arrived on a visit to London. Downing Street said it would issue a statement after he met Gordon Brown. "The offer would be conditional on a comprehensive agreement being agreed by the leaders of the two communities and then accepted by a majority of their populations and formally ratified by both sides," the UN said in a statement. Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 which was triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. The Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides re-started peace negotiations in September 2008. The offer would be for a handover of 45 square miles, just under half of the 98 square miles (254 sq km) that Britain now controls. 'Boost process'BBC world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge said the British government first made its conditional offer in 2003, before modifying it in 2004. The same offer has now been repeated. There are two British bases in the British sovereign territory. It is understood they would both continue in operation after the handing over of the territory. The Greek and Turkish Cypriots restarted peace negotiations in September last year, and it is understood that the British government hopes that renewing this offer now could give "a bit of a boost to a process that seems to lack movement". The Turkish Cypriot leader since 2005, Mehmet Ali Talat, favours reunification and membership of the EU for the whole island but he will soon be facing a new election. The National Unity Party, which favours unification with Turkey, won parliamentary elections in the Turkish-held area in April of this year.

Boy guilty over �1 pizza murder
Noor Kasimi was stabbed through the heart
A 14-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering a pizza shop worker in a row over a special offer.
The Old Bailey heard how the boy attacked Noor Kasimi, 32, with a knife after being refused a �1 pizza one hour after the promotion had ended.
Mr Kasimi had tried to get the boy out of the Twin Star take-away in Holloway Road, north London, in September 2004 when he was stabbed through the heart.
The boy, who cannot be named because of his age, denied murder.
We were struggling for our lives
Aabed Kashif, shop manager
Judge Gerald Gordon warned the boy, who was 13 at the time of the incident, he would have to be detained after a minimum term had been fixed.
Sallie Bennett-Jenkins, prosecuting, told the court on Thursday the boy took a knife from his pocket and threatened staff at the take-away after being asked to leave.
Mr Kasimi, who had worked there for five days, tried to get the boy out of the shop using a broom after he started lashing out with the knife.
Aabed Kashif, who ran the shop with his brother, said: "We were struggling for our lives. He was still attacking us. We were trying to get him out of the shop."
'Self-defence'
Staff managed to get the boy out of the shop but Mr Kasimi's broom fell to the floor and he was stabbed in the chest.
He died six days later in hospital.
The teenager handed himself into police the next day, claiming he had acted in self-defence.
Judge Gordon remanded the boy in custody for reports to a date to be fixed.

Carnival route remains unchanged
The carnival is worth about �90m to the London economy
The route to this year's Notting Hill Carnival will remain unchanged, organisers have announced.
Speaking at the event's official launch, organisers said the traditional parade route would continue through Notting Hill.
Critics have said the narrow streets of the area are too cramped and dangerous for the crowds that attend.
In 2005, London's mayor introduced a separate event in Hyde Park which drew criticism from some supporters.
Slavery and leukaemia
This will continue with the Panorama event - a steel band competition taking place in Hyde Park on the Saturday before the carnival.
The theme for this year's carnival, to run on 26 and 27 August, is Set All Free.
"The theme for Carnival 2007, has a very serious message," said Notting Hill Carnival's chairman, Professor Chris Mullard.
"We mark the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade and acknowledge that slavery continues around the world today in many forms."
About 2m visitors are expected to attend the carnival over the Bank Holiday weekend.
Based on previous figures, visitors are expected to consume about five tonnes of chicken, one tonne of rice and peas and 25,000 bottles of rum, said organisers.
Mayor Ken Livingstone said: "I am very pleased to be backing the carnival again, particularly in the year that we are marking the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in England."
The official charity of this year's carnival is the African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust (ACLT). The trust hopes the high-profile boost will encourage more black and mixed race people to donate their bone marrow to leukaemia sufferers.
It said black people are currently 20,000 times less likely than white people to find a successful match from a bone marrow donor.

Tram named for Baggies hero
Jeff Astle is West Brom's most famous player
Former England football striker Jeff Astle is to have a tram named after him.
The West Bromwich Albion legend emerged as the most popular choice when the people of Sandwell were asked to nominate a candidate to be immortalised on a Midland Metro tram.
Astle's friend and former television colleague Frank Skinner will unveil the nameplate on Saturday before West Brom's Premiership clash with Everton at the Hawthorns.
Astle, who played for England five times, is the first person to be honoured in such a way on the Wolverhampton to Birmingham tramway, which opened in May 1999.
What would have pleased him more than anything was that he was the people's choice, because he was a man of the people
Laraine Astle
Frank Skinner said: "It's a real honour to be part of the naming ceremony for the new Jeff Astle tram.
"I don't there is much danger of Albion fans ever forgetting Jeff - even the ones who never saw him play are aware of how special he was - but this seems like a really unique way of paying tribute to the great man."
Astle's widow Laraine told Centro, the owners of Midland Metro, that her husband would have been delighted with the honour.
"Jeff would be very proud. What would have pleased him more than anything was that he was the people's choice, because he was a man of the people.
"Also, it makes it special for me, because our daughter Claire travelled on the Metro regularly when she was at the University of Birmingham and living in West Bromwich."
The striker died at his home in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, aged 59 in January 2002.

In pics: David Beckham's career
Becks played his first game for Manchester United when he was just 17. In 1998 he got engaged to Victoria who was famous then in pop group the Spice Girls. His career hit an all time low when he was sent off in the 1998 World Cup as England lost to Argentina. During his time at Manchester United they won the Premier League six times, the FA Cup twice and the Champions League here in 1999. At the age of only 25 he had already written a book all about his life!
David and Victoria have three sons - here he is celebrating winning the Carling Cup with a very young Brooklyn. He's one of the richest footy players in the world and makes millions from advertising different products.
Becks has had lots of different haircuts, the most famous one was this mohican. He's famous for his amazing freekicks - this one in the last minute against Greece meant England qualified for Euro 2002. In 2003 he and Victoria met the Queen as he was awarded an OBE at Buckingham Palace. David does lots of work with other sports and was part of the team who helped bring the 2012 Olympics to London. After Manchester United David played for AC Milan and then moved to America in 2007 to play for LA Galaxy. The star has always enjoyed getting tattoos and showing off his athletic body!
After being ruled out of the 2010 World Cup with injury he helped coach the England team. David and Brooklyn like lots of sports and went to Wimbledon earlier this summer to support Andy Murray. Back

Crouch named new Saints chairman
Southampton have reappointed Leon Crouch as chairman of the club's football board.
The Hampshire-based businessman has reclaimed the role he held temporarily until the summer. Crouch, 58, is to spearhead the hunt for a new PLC chairman who in turn will be charged with encouraging new sources of investment in the club.
"I will do everything I possibly can to help us get back into the Premier League," Crouch told the club website.
606: DEBATE
The guy has a few shortcomings but he is a lifelong Saints fan and wears his heart on his sleeve
Delcanto
"We have some good people with the best interests of the club at heart and we will work closely with manager George Burley to build on the current run of good form and to push for promotion in the second half of the season."
Crouch took over on an acting basis following Michael Wilde's decision to resign over a lack of investment in the club in February.
Southampton, 11th in the Championship, are still desperate for a cash injection after potential investor Ray Ranson took over at Coventry, and may be forced to sell players when the January transfer window reopens.

Graeme McDowell aware of pitfalls after first major win
The Open Championship, St Andrews, 15-18 JulyCoverage: Live on BBC TV, Red Button, BBC Sport website, with updates on BBC Radio 5 live Full coverage details
Graeme McDowell at Tuesday's press conference at St Andrews
US Open winner Graeme McDowell will seek out the advice of other major champions as he aims to build on his triumph at Pebble Beach.McDowell, preparing for this week's Open at St Andrews, has been inundated with congratulations from the great and the good of world golf. However, the Northern Irishman is aware of the pitfalls that can be lurking for first-time major winners. "There's all kinds of mistakes that guys have made in the past," he said. "I'm very aware of the pitfalls: complacency; expectation levels; really trying to change my game now I'm a major champion. "How I deal with it in the long term boils down to decisions that I make, my schedule, big decisions like that." McDowell added that he plans to seek out advice from previous major winners Ernie Els and Padraig Harrington in the coming weeks. "I know plenty of guys like Ernie and Padraig to be able to seek them out in the next few months to have dinner and chats with them and understand how they have dealt with it in the past. "(But) I've got a great team of people working with me and I believe they'll not let me make the mistakes that will sort of drag me down." McDowell, who will play with former US Open winners Jim Furyk and Geoff Ogilvy in his opening two rounds at the home of golf, is continuing to receive words of congratulations from the golfing world. 606: DEBATE
Personally, I get a great deal of pleasure listening to Peter Alliss warbling away in 'pipe and slippers' mode
drive4show
"Frank Nobilo just asked for my number so he could pass it on to Greg Norman," added McDowell on Tuesday. "All the players coming up to me from both sides of the Atlantic have been really happy for me. "It's tough to pick out letters and emails from people - (but) Arnold Palmer, Peter Alliss, legends of the game. "I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to be able to enjoy my first major championship and everything that goes with it." McDowell is one of four Northern Irish golfers in the field this week, alongside Rory McIlroy, Darren Clarke - who secured his place only by finishing second at Loch Lomond on Sunday - and Gareth Maybin. McIlroy has missed the cut in the last two majors and is 13 over par for the only two Opens he has played so far, but is still rated second favourite by some bookmakers behind Tiger Woods. "Rory is a very experienced young man for a 21-year-old," McDowell added. "I know he came here on Thursday and Friday last week and spent the last four days back in Northern Ireland playing at Royal County Down and Portrush. "He's been on the big stage before, I don't think there's any risk he'll get over-excited. "I really think Rory has a great chance this week. He loves this golf course, he's got a pretty mature head on young shoulders and he's got the game to do it."
