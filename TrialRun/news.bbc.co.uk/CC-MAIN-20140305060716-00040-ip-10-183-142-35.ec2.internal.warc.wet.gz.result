Haiti poll monitors pull out
Aristide's party was awarded most seats in the first round
The Organisation of American States (OAS) mission in Haiti has said it will not observe the second round of voting in parliamentary elections on Sunday. The regional grouping of 35 nations said its monitors would take no part in the second round of voting because it was unhappy at the with the way votes were counted after the first poll in May. Repeating its withdrawal from the controversial reelection of President Alberto Fujimori in Peru in May, the OAS said it was forced into its decision because the principle of one-person one-vote had been violated.
Opposition supporters were unhappy about the first round of results
There has also been violence after supporters of a losing candidate in a remote provincial town went on the rampage wounding 12 people.
Incorrect
Opposition candidates complained that results of the 21 May first-round vote were miscalculated to give the Lavalas party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide a strong lead. The electoral council awarded 16 of the 19 Senate seats available in the first round to Lavalas, and has staunchly refused to recount the ballots.
The OAS said Haiti's election body calculated the results in a way that gave Lavalas more outright victories in Senate seats than it was due.
"The OAS electoral observation mission has determined that, according to provisions of Haiti's own electoral legislation, the final results for the senate elections as proclaimed by the Provisional Electoral Council are incorrect," the OAS said in a statement.
"The mission cannot consider them either accurate or fair," it said.
US critics
The United States criticised Haiti's Government earlier on Friday for not planning to hold run-offs this Sunday for Senate seats where results were in doubt after the first round. US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters that the methods used to tabulate the results were incorrect and cast doubts over the whole election.
"The failure of the Haitian Government and the electoral authorities to use the proper method in determining winners in the senate election certainly calls into question the credibility of the entire Haitian election process," he added.
The mission cannot consider them either accurate or fair
OAS statement Jean Bertrand Aristide, a former Catholic priest, is widely expected to run for president and win later this year.
Haiti's first freely elected president was overthrown in 1991 by a military coup that resulted in a reign of terror that ended in 1994 when the United States sent 20,000 troops to restore him.
Haiti's Government has been paralysed for most of the past three years after parliamentary elections held in April 1997 were declared fraudulent.
Sunday's election aims to fill 19 of the 27 seats in the Senate and all 83 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, as well as thousands of municipal posts nationwide.

Union anger at Rover 'betrayal'
Thousands of jobs could go if BMW sells Rover
British union leaders have left a meeting with senior BMW managers in Munich, without securing assurances about the future of the loss-making Rover Group.
Rover's parent company, BMW, has said a sell-off of Rover's car division is just one of the options it is considering.
Tony Woodley of the transport union described BMW as a "dishonourable" firm which planned to "cut and run" at the expense of British workers.
BMW's board will meet on Thursday to discuss proposals to sell or close the loss-making parts of Rover, and focus on profitable divisions like MG, Landrover and Range Rover.
We will do everything we possibly can ... to safeguard the future of the plant.
Tony Blair
Such a move could cost thousands of jobs both at Rover and at the up to 500 firms that supply parts to the company.
The impact on the economy of the West Midlands could be devastating.
Prime Minister Tony Blair told parliament on Wednesday that he attached "enormous strategic importance" to the company and promised to "do everything we possibly can ... to safeguard the future of the plant". Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers cleared his diary to talk both to Rover's chairman and his bosses at BMW.
Rescue plan?
Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported on Wednesday evening that the internal row over Rover's future would cost three top managers at BMW their job.
Carl-Peter Forster, Henrich Heitmann und Wolfgang Ziebart, in charge of sales, development and production respectively, would be "sacked", the paper said. The paper also reported that a group of British investors based on the Cayman islands had made an offer for Rover's car division.
Other reports suggested that mystery bidder may be former Rover marketing director Kevin Morley. He was reportedly preparing to mount a bid through a venture capital firm called Alchemy.
Mr Morley, speaking his from home in the exclusive Boars Hill area of Oxford said: "I'm not prepared to discuss anything."
Mr Morley left Rover in 1992 to set up his own advertising agency, which he later sold. He was also behind the unsuccessful consortium that was bidding to keep Rolls-Royce in British hands.
Professor Kumar Bhattcharyya of Warwick University, who is close to Rover, said he thought the bid "is a serious offer and will be considered seriously".
Cannon fodder
Mr Woodley, national officer of the Transport and General Workers Union, said he believed the break-up was in progress and he accused the firm of treating staff like "cannon fodder".
There is no doubt that my instincts tell me we are dealing with the proposed break-up of Rover
Tony Woodley, TGWU
Unions and business leaders have called on the German car firm to make an immediate decision about Rover's future. But there is great bitterness about the broken promises by the German firm.
Rover 1999
Sales: 143,343 cars
Market share: 6.52%
Losses: 1.3bn euros (estimate)
Rover 1998 Sales: 193,919 cars
Market share: 8.63%
Losses: 957m euros
Rover employs nearly 10,000 workers at Longbridge in Birmingham, and thousands more at Cowley near Oxford and other UK plants.
BMW is reported to have become concerned about mounting losses, which are expected to reach ï¿½800m this year. The last straw has been the high pound, which made Rover uncompetitive in Europe.
Hundreds of millions of pounds of British taxpayers' money were provided to
encourage BMW to maintain the Longbridge plant
Michael Fabricant, MP
Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said BMW had previously given assurances that it remained committed to Rover.
He said: "I am confident that BMW will remain committed to Rover but they have to make their position absolutely clear. It is time to remove any shadow of doubt about the future."
Unions keen for talks with BMW's chairman Joachim Milberg
The Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that, if true, the BMW move would be a "devastating" blow for the West Midlands.
Birmingham Northfield MP Richard Burden, whose constituency covers Longbridge, said BMW officials had personally assured him they were committed to Longbridge "for the long term", and he found it astonishing that the company was not denying the reports.

Serial killer spoof to be screened
Sex and drugs in new drama Men Only
A TV spoof about the Yorkshire Ripper is be screened four years after it was shelved for being too controversial.
The Chris Morris series Brass Eye is to be reshown as part of Channel 4's spring and summer schedule, with a segment about the serial killer in it.
It was originally pulled after complaints about the sketch, which pretends a musical was to be made about the life of the serial killer.
Now Channel 4 bosses believe viewers will understand the humour.
Chris Morris' Brass Eye set to shock
The station's new schedule will also feature new programmes about sex and drugs.
Drugs: The Phoney War will see presenter Nick Davies call for the decriminalisation of heroin.
Drugs and sex will also feature heavily in the drama serial Men Only.
Channel 4 has set itself the ambitious task of screening all 19 works by playwright Samuel Beckett.
Heavyweight actors Jeremy Irons, John Hurt, Alan Rickman and Hannibal's Julianne Moore appear in films directed by the likes of Neil Jordan and Anthony Minghella.
Trigger Happy TV returns for series two
Channel 4 also presents Hitler's Holocaust, with German film-makers examining the horrors of their country's recent history. Big Brother
The major documentary series has been produced under the guidance of Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal and features
previously unseen Eastern European archive film.
Lighter highlights in the schedule include last year's success story Big Brother, set to return to screens in the summer.
A new gameshow Lost will test stamina and strategy as teams are blindfolded and stranded in remote countries and given the task of finding their way back to the UK.
Brass Eye was created to show how easily celebrities and MPs would rally behind a cause which they knew nothing about.
A drug called Cake was invented for one show, and TV presenter Noel Edmonds and David Amess MP fell for the trick and spoke out against it.

Fears of Pakistan's Christians
Protesters are demanding justice
By Kathryn Westcott
BBC News Online
Christian leaders in Pakistan have warned of further bloody attacks against the country's minority community if the government fails to take tougher action to "purge the roots of extremism".
The warnings come in the wake of Wednesday's killings of seven employees of a Christian charity in the Pakistani city of Karachi.
A family grieves after the attack in Karachi
Although Christian leaders caution that it is too early to blame militant groups for attacks, they argue that it bears the "signs of a continuation of attacks against Christian institutions".
Samson Salamat of the Institute of Peace and Justice - the organisation whose employees were murdered - says there had already been indications that militant groups were poised to attacks Christian institutions in Karachi.
"There is no doubt that we Christians are under a great threat," he told BBC News Online. "We can expect there to be more attacks." 'Roots of extremism'
"What's happening now is an indication that the government has not done enough to crack down on extremist groups," he says. Shahbaz Bhatti, who heads both the Christian Liberation Front and the All Pakistan Minority Alliance - a grouping of minority political parties - concurs.
He says the government has "failed to purge the roots of extremism." Christian groups are identified with the West and extremist groups have launched attacks to avenge US-led action in Afghanistan
Shahbaz Bhatti
"On the one hand it is trying to crush terrorism by arresting extremists, but on the other, it has refused to ban extremist religious parties," he told News Online.
"[The extremists] call for a war against the infidel and for the establishment of a Taleban-style government at their public rallies."
The All Pakistan Minority Alliance plans to hold three days of mourning in protest. Christian schools and institutions will be closed and a march is planned to the United Nations building in Islamabad. "We will be appealing to the international community for lean on the government to do more to protect the lives of Pakistan's Christians," Mr Bhatti says. Good relations
"If it doesn't, there will be far, far greater bloodshed - maybe even genocide." He says the minority community had become increasingly victimised since the US-led war on terror was launched after the attacks on America last September. Security had been stepped up in Karachi in recent days
"Christian groups are identified with the West and extremist groups have launched attacks to avenge US-led action in Afghanistan," Mr Bhatti says.
He predicts that the attacks will be stepped up if there is a US-led military attack against Iraq.
During the Gulf War in 1991, churches were burnt and Christians harassed. But Christian leaders agree that, within the general populace, relations between Muslims and Christians are good. "The recent trouble has been caused by fanatical individuals that support al-Qaeda," the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Karachi Simeon Pereira, told us. Otherwise, he says, there is little evidence of anti-Christian sentiment. He says the authorities have tried to protect the Christian community by posting police outside churches. But the archbishop also fears there is more bloodshed to come. "I have heard reports that within the next 20 days there will be more attacks on Christian institutions. We will try to defend ourselves the best we can. We don't know what will happen - we will have to trust in God.

Anonymity issue should be debated
John Leslie maintained his innocence
Parliament should examine whether sex charge defendants should be given anonymity, according to the most senior judge in England and Wales.
The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, refused to comment on the John Leslie case, but he said there was a "fine balance" on the question of whether people accused of sexual offences should be exposed to publicity.
"The situation has got to be kept under continual review. It's a very fine balance," he said.
"Where the balance should be, would be helped by being clarified by Parliament."
Jason McCue, a member of Mr Leslie's legal team, called for anonymity to be reintroduced for suspects.
'Trial by media'
He said it was "outrageous" that Mr Leslie had been forced to live through "this nightmare" while the woman who accused him had anonymity. Lord Woolf said it was wrong to have trial by media. "It is the court's job to try people," he added.
Matthew Kelly and other celebrities have also faced unsubstantiated sexual allegations recently - reigniting the debate over the extensive media coverage some cases get long before any trial.
The Home Office says there are no plans to change the law at present.
But it says talks with police and newspaper editors are "ongoing" to see what can be done to strengthen guidelines on reporting the names of people being investigated for an offence, but where no charge has been brought.
Former shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe argued there should be a "level playing field" for both defendants and complainants.
'Enormous damage'
"It may be true that if the defendant is named people will then come forward who may otherwise have kept quiet," she told BBC News.
"But it is also true that if you have a woman who has a history of making allegations unless she is named that is not going to come out."
Former Conservative MP Neil Hamilton, who with his wife Christine was falsely accused of raping a woman, said he was delighted the charges against John Leslie had been dropped, but criticised the CPS for pursuing the case.
"I'm absolutely delighted on the one hand, but appalled that this case got so far on such flimsy evidence. This has caused enormous damage to an innocent man."
Mr Hamilton said it was time for the law to be changed so that anonymity was extended to those accused of committing a sexual offence.
People who think he is still guilty should be ashamed of themselves
Neil Hamilton
"Anonymity is required to protect the victims of people's allegations just as it is for the people who make them."
He said John Leslie would now find it difficult to shake off the allegations - despite having the charges dropped.
"People will say there's no smoke without fire. You can never 100% disprove the allegation if it's one word against another. In our case we could break down the allegations bit by bit and prove it wasn't true.
"But people who think he is still guilty should be ashamed of themselves."
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Simon Hughes said the case showed urgent action was needed to stop such accusations appearing in the media.
"Given the relentless media interest in sex cases, it is surely time to look again at the question of anonymity," he said.
"From the moment someone is suspected of committing a sex offence until they are charged, there should be no publicity which could identify them.
"After charges are laid, the presumption should be in favour of disclosing the defendant's name.
"However, an application could be made to the court to extend anonymity if it was in the public interest to do so."

In pictures: World's largest jigsaw puzzle
Loads of you have probably spent a lazy afternoon doing a jigsaw with your family or your mates, but have you ever had a go at a puzzle with more than a million pieces?
That's what thousands of puzzle fans were facing when they got together in the German town of Ravensburg to try to make the world's largest jigsaw.
The giant jigsaw was made by completing thousands of smaller jigsaws which were put together on a massive board in the town square.
They'd only just started here - look how big the board is!
It took more than 15,000 puzzlers five hours to fit 1,141,800 pieces together. They created a puzzle that covers the same amount of space as 25 double decker buses!
Organisers say the finished puzzle is much bigger than the current record set in Singapore six years ago... But officials are still checking to to see if it really is a record-breaker!

1978: Carter wins Panama Canal battle
The US Senate has backed a treaty to transfer the Panama Canal to the control of Panama.
The Senate's approval by 68 votes to 32 was by the narrowest of margins - just one vote more than the two-thirds majority required.
The outcome was seen as a victory for President Jimmy Carter's foreign policy at a time when the effectiveness of his administration is under question.
Last September President Carter signed two treaties with Panama's leader, General Omar Torrijos Herrera.
The first provided for the gradual transfer of the canal to Panamanian control on 31 December 1999.
The other declared the canal neutral territory and open to vessels of all nations.
However, the US has retained the right to defend the canal, preferably in support of Panama but alone, if necessary. Domestic opposition
The canal - a 51-mile (82-kilometre) swath through Panama - cuts thousands of miles off sea journeys between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
Started by the French in 1880, the US took over the construction of the canal in 1904 and completed it 10 years later.
In return for rights to the waterway the US recognised Panama - which was then attempting to break away from Colombia - as a sovereign state and paid it $10m and an annuity of $250,000.
During the First and Second World Wars the canal was a vital strategic artery for the United States and its allies.
But it could not accommodate the larger vessels which had become part of the US fleet by the time of the Korean War. There had been fierce domestic opposition to the prospect of giving up the canal which critics argued was a necessary part of the US's defences.
But President Jimmy Carter argued that the issue of the canal was leading to an upsurge of anti-American feeling in Panama and other Latin American nations.
In Context On 31 December 1999 at a ceremony on the banks of the Panama Canal, former US President Jimmy Carter signed over control of the canal and the 10-mile-wide enclave surrounding it. The US president at the time, Bill Clinton, and members of his administration decided not to attend.
This was regarded as a snub by the Panamanians.

Bath City boss Adie Britton tips Crawley Town to go up
Britton's Bath are in 13th spot after promotion last season
Bath City manager Adie Britton believes Crawley Town will gain automatic promotion from the Blue Square Bet Premier into the Football League.Bath have played the three top sides this month, drawing against Luton and AFC Wimbledon but losing to Crawley. "I think Crawley will win it as they've just got that extra bit of quality," Britton told BBC Radio Bristol. "When you've spent half a million in transfers so far this season then you are the haves of the league." Britton continued: "In particular they've got Matt Tubbs and he should be playing in the Championship, I think. "The two goals he scored on the night decided the game and had he been playing for us we would have won the game, simple as that. "So I think they're the tip and Luton and Wimbledon will be fighting it out in the play-offs."

Kirwan targets League stars
Kirwan turned down a move to league in his playing days
Italy coach John Kirwan admits he is hoping to unearth a gem by targeting rugby league players of Italian extraction to play for the Azzurri.
England's Jason Robinson and Australia's Wendell Sailor and Mat Rogers have all made successful tranisitions in recent years.
Sydney Roosters' Anthony Minichello and David Campese's nephew Terry have caught Kirwan's eye.
"It would be stupid of me not to look at the talent down here," he said.
Campese plays stand-off for the Canberra Raiders and his performance in the NRL semi-final against the New Zealand Warriors impressed Kirwan.
"I saw him play in the semi-final the other day in the rugby league," he said. "He has a good boot on him like his uncle."
Kirwan has scouts searching for new talent, but does not expect the plan to bear fruit immediately.
"I'm not really concentrating on it. I know there are a few guys down here who are looking at guys for me, but I won't be talking to anyone," he told The Australian newspaper.

Baxter protests innocence
Baxter wants to challenge the IOC drugs testing procedure
By BBC Sport Online's Anna Thompson
Banned skier Alain Baxter is to lodge an appeal in an attempt to clear his name of using a performance-enhancing drug. But the British skier has yet to decide whether he will appeal against losing his slalom bronze medal, which he lost after testing positive for methamphetamine at the Winter Olympics.
Baxter wants the International Olympic Committee to carry out a test to prove that the form of the drug found in his body has no effect on performance.
I fully believe I have been made an example of by the IOC
Alain Baxter
There are two forms of methamphetamine.
Baxter was found to have traces of the non-performance-enhancing "L" side in his system from a Vicks inhaler. But the IOC test did not differentiate it from the more potent "D" side, a stimulant more commonly known as speed. Baxter wants to persuade the IOC to carry out a split test to establish which type was in his body.
Baxter told BBC Sport Online: "I have to appeal to clear my name. An appeal could also force the IOC to change the rules on methamphetamine.
"The IOC should seriously look into this. Other banned substances like nandrolone have thresholds.
Medal hope
"If methamphetamine had something like this, I would have been well below the threshold.
"I fully believe I have been made an example of by the IOC."
Baxter will have to decide whether to appeal against the IOC's decision to strip him of the medal by 12 April.
He said: "There is a lot to consider.
"There have been cases similar to mine which have been won at appeal. So there is a small chance I could get it back.
"I have kind of come to terms that my medal has gone but maybe I will see it in my living room again."
Baxter is now aiming to get back ski training as soon as possible.
Next week he is heading to Austria to test a number of skis.
But he cannot take part in any races because he has been suspended by the International Ski Federation (FIS) pending the IOC's decision.
If I'm fit and healthy and still enjoying my skiing, I'm fully intending to be at the 2006 Winter Olympics
Alain Baxter
FIS will decide at a meeting on 3 June what punishment to meter out to Baxter.
He added: "I should be racing now instead of being at home.
"I've missed a couple of races and I will not be allowed to take part in the Scottish Championships.
"I'm waiting to hear from FIS what ban, if any, they will give me.
"I haven't even thought about a long ban.
"If I'm fit and healthy and still enjoying my skiing, I'm fully intending to be at the 2006 Winter Olympics."
