High cost of health
By Richard Allen Greene
BBC News Online in Detroit, Michigan
Roy Davis had a massive stroke, two days after starting a new job
Once Roy Davis had been out of work for a year, his unemployment benefits ran out - and with them, his health insurance.
That left him unable to afford his high-blood pressure medication, so he stopped taking it.
He finally managed to find another job, but on 8 January 2002 - his second day at work - he had a massive stroke, partly due to the untreated blood pressure problem.
He spent three days in a coma, and when he came out of it, he had lost the ability to walk and speak.
His wife Defannie now cares for him full-time. She herself does not have health insurance.
Her situation has led her to question her country's priorities.
"We have the resources to send billions of dollars to Iraq, so I don't think people should have to use [hospital] emergency rooms to get care," she says.
Deaths
Roy Davis's case may be extreme, but it is not unique. SNAPSHOT: HEALTH CARE
Number of Americans without health insurance: 45 million Number who die each year due to lack of cover: 18,000
Percentage of businesses that provide health insurance: 61% (down from 65% in 2001)
Sources: US Census Bureau; Institute of Medicine, Detroit Free Press
In fact, for some, the consequences are even worse: The Institute of Medicine estimates that about 18,000 Americans die each year because they lack health insurance.
Almost one in six Americans does not have it - 45 million people, according to US Census Bureau figures released in August. And the percentage of Americans without health care is slowly rising.
Defannie Davis is one of many Americans who says health care is among the most important issues in this election.
"Security should be top of the list - health care isn't going to matter if we're all dead - but health care should come next. The biggest thing is a person being healthy," she says.

She is pleased that Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry has said he would expand health care coverage if elected.
Mr Kerry has proposed tax credits for businesses and individuals, health care for all children, and lower costs for prescription drugs.
"There is simply no excuse for hard-working Americans having to worry about whether they will be able to afford the treatment they need when they are sick," he has told supporters.
President Bush advocates bringing health care costs down by limiting the damages people can claim in medical malpractice lawsuits.
"All across the country, doctors are being litigated out of practice and American families are finding it more difficult to find health insurance," Bush campaign spokesman Steve Schmidt told the Associated Press.
Mr Bush has also suggested allowing groups of small businesses to band together so they can buy health care plans at the lower rates offered to bigger companies.
No national health care
Unlike many Western nations, the US has no national health care system.

"The difference between the US and western Europe is very clear - we never decided that every person should have health coverage," says Stuart Schear of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a charity that focuses on health care.
"There has been an effort dating back to the early 20th Century to make sure every American has health coverage, but it has never succeeded."
Employers became the primary source of health insurance during World War II. Wages were frozen, so employees negotiated for businesses to provide insurance as an alternative to pay rises.
The tax code now encourages employers to purchase health care for their employees. But not all of the uninsured are out of work - the Alliance for Health Reform estimates than more than 80% of uninsured people are employed.
The percentage of employers providing health care has dropped from 65% to 61% in the past three years.
"Many working people are not offered benefits. Some employers say it is too expensive," Mr Schear says.
"Some workers are offered it but have to pay a share [of the costs] when they see a doctor or need medication, so not all who are offered it take it up, because they cannot afford it. "The big policy question is how to help these people."

Global poll slams Bush leadership
Negative feelings for Mr Bush extended to Americans as a whole
More than half of people surveyed in a BBC World Service poll say the re-election of US President George W Bush has made the world more dangerous.
Only three countries - India, Poland and the Philippines - out of 21 polled believed the world was now safer.
The survey found that 47% of the 21,953 people questioned now see US influence in the world as largely negative, and view Americans negatively as well.
None of the countries polled supported contributing their troops to Iraq.
"This is quite a grim picture for the US," said Steven Kull, director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA), which carried out the poll with GlobeScan.
There may be some underlying openness to repairing relations with the US"
Steven Kull
Bush election riles Europeans
India backs Bush
"Negative feelings about Bush are high and are generalising to the American people who re-elected him."
On average across all countries, 58% of people - and 16 out of 21 countries polled - said they believed Mr Bush's re-election to the White House made the world more dangerous. Traditional allies
Most negative feelings were found in Western European, Latin American and Muslim countries. They include traditional US allies such as Germany, France, Britain and Italy as well as neighbours Canada and Mexico.
Read key points and see graphs from the World Service poll.
At-a-glance The only European country to buck the trend was Poland, one of the new members of the European Union, which gave the thumbs up to both President Bush and the US.
Turkey topped the anti-Bush list, with 82% believing his re-election would be negative for global security. The result is bad news for the president as Turkey is a US ally and the only Muslim member of Nato, says the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels. Other predominantly Muslim countries - Indonesia and Lebanon - were also high up the list.
But, any warmer feelings in Indonesia towards the US following its tsunami relief operations would not show up as the poll was carried out before the disaster struck, says the BBC's Dan Isaacs.
Economic boom
Anti-Bush sentiments also appeared to be strong in Latin America. Argentina, with 79%, and Brazil, with 78%, follow Turkey in the list.
This seems surprising given that the region has had less direct involvement in US foreign policy issues, says our correspondent.
Another surprise was India's support for Mr Bush. The poll found 62% believed his administration was positive for global security.
The BBC's Nick Bryant says the reason for this may be because the poll was carried out in cities where people have benefited economically from closer trade ties with the US.
Doug Miller, President of Globescan, said the findings "supports the view of some Americans that unless his administration changes its approach to world affairs in its second term, it will continue to erode America's good name, and hence its ability to effectively influence world affairs".
But Mr Kull says the results do not constitute a definitive world-wide majority, "suggesting there may be some underlying openness to repairing relations with the US".
PIPA interviewed between 500 and 1,800 people in each of the 21 countries surveyed, plus 1,000 Americans, in face-to-face or telephone interviews.
The interviews took place between 15 November 2004 and 5 January 2005.
The margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points, depending on the country.

In pictures: Pamplona's bull run
Tens of thousands of people have flocked to the northern Spanish city of Pamplona to watch the annual bull run.
Bull running is the most famous aspect of the nine-day annual fiesta to honour San Fermin, the patron saint of Pamplona.
During the event, hundreds of people choose to run the 900-metre route alongside six half-tonne fighting bulls.
Despite the dangers, runners often drink copious quantities of alcohol through the night before joining the early-morning run. On the first day of the bull run, at least six people were injured, four of them foreigners. A total of 13 people have been killed since records began in 1924. The last death was in 1995.
Bull fighting and other events involving animals also form a major part of the festival, which is characterised by drinking and dancing.
But the bloody events have attracted the attention of thousands of animal rights activists, many of whom traditionally protest in the nude.
After nine days of non-stop partying, the celebrations will wind down on 14 July when the exhausted revellers end with a traditional Spanish song entitled Pobre de mi - or Poor Me. Back

Net boost for Macedonia troops
Nato troops will stay in Macedonia for just 30 days
By the BBC's Peter Gould
British soldiers in Macedonia are planning to use the internet to keep in touch with their families back home.
An internet cafe is being set up at their base, to provide them with access to email. It is also hoped to install webcams to create a video link with their barracks at Colchester in Essex. More than 700 paratroopers will join the Nato force
Seven hundred members of the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment are spending the next month in Macedonia as part of a Nato operation called Essential Harvest. They will join forces with troops from other nations in collecting weapons from ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
During previous deployments overseas, members of the armed forces have had to rely on letters or the occasional phone call to reassure their loved ones that they are safe and well.
Email boosts morale
It is a sign of the times that the British Army is now using the power of the internet to provide its soldiers with an instant, daily link with home.
The military version of the internet cafe should be good for the morale of the soldiers, and may help to lessen the anxiety of their families, concerned about the possible dangers in Macedonia. Morale is sky high and the boys are raring to go
Captain Pete Flynn Military leaders regard the task of collecting the guerrillas' weapons as a relatively low risk operation. But in the Balkans things are rarely simple, and everyone is aware of the potential for trouble.
Yet the battalion's adjutant, Captain Pete Flynn, insists that his paratroops can't wait to get out to Macedonia.
'Simple' mission
"Morale is sky high and the boys are raring to go," he said, as they headed off for a military airfield. "All the boys are happy with the mission because it's fairly simple. It's weapons collection, there's no peace keeping, there's no mandate to do anything else. A bandsman prepares to leave for Macedonia
"You never can tell with these sorts of operations what may develop in days to come, but one thing which has been key for the Balkans is that early intervention is normally the recipe for success, and we hope that's what we are doing this time."
Among the 700 members of 2 Para is 17-year-old Craig Sewell, from Barrow-in-Furness.
"I only joined the battalion about three weeks ago, so I've obviously not been in any action," he said.
"I'm looking forward to it. A lot of people have been waiting a long time to go on an operation, so it's good."
Excitement and anxiety
For younger members of the battalion, this is a chance to put their training to the test. On Wednesday, at their barracks in Colchester, there was the customary religious service held before troops go into action. The padre said their emotions were a mixture of excitement and anxiety.
It seemed an accurate description when I later talked to some of the men as they packed their bags.
Sgt Wayne Rackham said the older hands would act as father figures to younger members of the battalion. He felt that for all of them, their professional training would get them through the operation.
My wife is used to it, but my children do worry
Sgt Wayne Rackham He said he did not think about the possible risks, although he knew that his family would be concerned about him while he was away.
"My wife is used to it, but my children do worry. They're a bit older so they look at the news and read papers. They don't know if you are going to come back. You've just got to tell them that everything is all right."
Corporal Darren Greedy said that the battalion was well prepared, physically and mentally, so it was just a case of getting the job done and then getting back home.
"We're as prepared as we can be," he said. "The motto of the parachute regiment is 'ready for anything' and we think we are." Full coverage

Economy is 'stuck' under Brown, says Cameron
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Budget of 'debt, waste and taxes'
Tory leader David Cameron has said the economy is "stuck" under Labour and an election is needed so a Conservative government can "clean up the mess".In his response to the Budget, Mr Cameron said the government had stolen Tory policies on stamp duty and higher tax on strong cider. He said the "only new ideas in British politics" were coming from the Tories. Urging an election, he said the "biggest risk to the recovery is five more years of this prime minister". Mr Cameron told MPs: "This prime minister is going around telling everyone 'stick with me, stick with what you know'. But that is the whole problem, this country is stuck with him, our economy is stuck, business is stuck, nothing is moving." Stamp duty 'copied'Speaking after Chancellor Alistair Darling had delivered his Budget speech, the last before a general election widely expected to be called for 6 May, Mr Cameron said the government had repeatedly over-estimated growth figures and asked why anybody should believe them. Referring to a stamp duty cut on homes under £250,000 for first-time buyers - which is similar to Tory plans - Mr Cameron asked: "Where on earth did they get that one from? "He came in as chancellor copying our inheritance tax cut, he leaves as chancellor copying our stamp duty cut." The risk to recovery is not in dealing with the deficit now, it's in not dealing with the deficit now

Darling targets first-time buyers
Analysis: Pitch to voters
The two parties have clashed over when to start cutting public spending - the Conservatives say it should start this year but the government argues that would risk "snuffing out" the economic recovery. Mr Cameron said a credible economic plan needed "action now and all we got was delay": "The risk to recovery is not in dealing with the deficit now, it's in not dealing with the deficit now. "Every family knows that when your debts mount up you need to start paying them off or things only get worse and it's time for the government to learn the same lessons." 'Should be ashamed'He said "honesty" was needed but instead they were given "double dealing" - as debt figures were based on growth forecasts that the government had previously got wrong. He said the government faced "a choice between bold action in an election year and just playing politics, and once again they chose politics". He said Mr Darling could have summed up his hour-long speech in one sentence: "Labour have made a complete mess of the British economy and they are doing nothing to clean it up." He said ministers "should be ashamed" and had given Britain "the deepest recession since the war". He dismissed Mr Darling's "boasts" that the government had taken the right action to help people through the recession, Mr Cameron said: "We were the first into recession and the last out of recession. "More businesses went bust in this recession than any other and more people went bankrupt under Labour than ever before in our history. "We have gone from the top of the premier league to the bottom of the conference in 13 wasted years and I say it's time to sack the manager," Mr Cameron added.

Tottenham finalise Defoe transfer
Defoe received a rapturous reception from the Spurs fans against Burnley
Tottenham have completed the signing of Jermain Defoe from Portsmouth for a fee thought to be about £15m.The two clubs agreed a fee on Monday, but the move was held up as the clubs negotiated over the structure of the payments and potential add-ons. The transfer was finally completed on Friday morning, meaning Defoe will be able to face Wigan on Sunday. "This is the third club I have signed him for. I know what a top-class player he is," said boss Harry Redknapp. "He is a proven goalscorer and I am pleased to have him here. I am sure the supporters are looking forward to seeing him back in a Spurs shirt." Defoe has signed a five-year contract with the club he left less than a year ago.
606: DEBATE
Is this good business?
Dom_Spur
Redknapp originally lured Defoe to Pompey in 2008, for a deal worth up to £12m, when he was in charge at Fratton Park. Defoe was paraded before the Spurs fans ahead of their home 4-1 Carling Cup first-leg semi-final win over Burnley, even though the Premier League had yet to approve the deal. Rule L19 forbids players returning to clubs within a year, but the League can waive this at its discretion. BBC Radio 5 Live's senior football reporter Ian Dennis explained: "From my understanding a sell-on clause worth about £4m by Portsmouth has been waived. "While the package is £15m the initial outlay isn't even double figures in terms of millions. Any transfer upwards of £10m, Spurs must announce to the Stock Exchange and there has been no listing of this transfer." Defoe scored 17 goals in 36 games for Portsmouth, comprising eight in his first seven matches and nine more this season.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Any deal for the forward, who has scored six goals in 32 appearances for England, also took into account monies owed to Tottenham by Portsmouth for Younes Kaboul and Pedro Mendes. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said: "We are delighted to welcome Jermain back to the club. "We had previously been keen for Jermain to sign a new contract to extend his initial stay but at that point in time he felt it was in his interests to move on in order to guarantee himself more starts. "I know the club is close to his heart and that he is thrilled to be back and to once again link up with Harry." The frontman had also been linked with Manchester City and Aston Villa. Former Spurs defender Gary Stevens is tipping the forward to be a big hit on his return to the club. "Defoe is a proven goal-scorer with a terrific strike record and if you play him on a regular basis and give him the ammunition, he will get you goals. It is what he was born to do," he told BBC Sport. "I'm sure when he moved to Portsmouth last January he didn't for one moment envisage going back to Spurs within a year. Harry will know exactly what he's getting from Defoe - and how to get the best out of him
Gary Stevens
"But I believe he never wanted to leave the club in the first place really and it appears that he always had a great affection for Tottenham. It's a win-win for the club and the player." It will be the third time Defoe has played under Redknapp as the duo were also together at West Ham near the turn of the century. Stevens said: "Relationships do develop in football and Harry will know exactly what he's getting from Defoe - and how to get the best out of him. "First things first, Jermain needs to get the goals that will help Spurs pull away from the drop zone. "But Spurs are still in three cup competitions and they say football is all about timing - maybe Jermain's arrival is just in time for him to make a cup final appearance." Redknapp is also keen to sign a left-sided midfielder in the January transfer window but Middlesbrough have already rejected two bids from the Londoners for Stewart Downing.
