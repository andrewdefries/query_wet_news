'Too much criminal legislation'
LAW IN ACTION
Law In Action

Listen to the programme
Law in Action gets a unique insight into Sir Ken Macdonald's time as Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales.His tenure was served in intense, febrile times as government policy focused on tackling terrorism. He tells the programme how this resulted in too much legislation and on more than one occasion brought him into conflict with government. 7/7 bombings
Sir Ken Macdonald QC was DPP on July 7th when three bombs were set off on the tube and one on a bus.
The DPP was ultimately responsible for the prosecution of terrorism in the aftermath of the July bombings in London in 2005. He says his reaction to the events on that day surprised him. He felt "a peculiar sense of responsibility" that he could have done something to stop the bombings. "The guilt felt by people in the top jobs led to a danger that people will overreact, which some governments across the western world did". Speaking out
Sir Ken did not always agree with then Home Secretary David Blunkett and spoke out against him. Sir Ken differed from his predecessors because he felt it was right as head of the Crown Prosecution Service, to speak out when he disagreed with government policy. One of those he came into conflict with was the then Home Secretary David Blunkett. Mr. Blunkett says "the DPP should have a voice but Sir Ken's privileged position of being able to express himself more clearly inside the system could have been used more effectively." 42 daysThe former DPP speaks about his opposition to the government's proposals to hold terror suspects for 42 days without charge. Jacqui Smith proposed allowing police to hold terror suspects for 42 days without charge.
This was a flagship policy for the government and was pushed hard by the Home Secretary at the time Jacqui Smith. Sir Ken says that he couldn't agree with the idea saying it was "undermining of civil liberties". Parliament should 'back off'He says that a need to be seen to be doing something fuelled a lot of the government's criminal and terror legislation during his time as DPP. He says that there has been far too much legislation and believes the next parliament could do well to "back off, calm down, and leave criminal justice alone for a while". 'Great tragedy'
Sir Ken decided to prosecute the Met police over the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes.
He is unrepentant about his decisions in the case of Jean Charles de Menezes who was mistakenly shot at Stockwell tube station in the days after the July 7th bombings. He says that there was no way he could prosecute individual police officers in that case. "Sometimes great tragedies take place in which there is no criminal culpability and it's not the job of prosecutors to start inventing it". Meeting the familiesFinally he speaks about his day to day role. He tells the story of meeting families to explain his decisions in particular that of Simon Murden another man shot dead by police this time in Humberside. He says in that case he over-ruled his CPS team and decided there was not a case for prosecuting any police officers in that case.

Your commentsWith reference to the shooting dead by police, without warning, of a "disturbed man", the issue should surely have been treated as a killing and police should have been prosecuted. What about the stun guns there was great publicity about, and what about the pepper spray all police officers now carry on their belts? In the USA, where all officers carry firearms, if there is a shooting, the policemen involved is suspended from duty immediately whilst the incident is investigated by Internal Affairs. If they find that the officer has NOT followed procedure, he is prosecuted for manslaughter. We need a similar system to apply in Britain. I feel that the police have lost a great deal of respect as the result of rushed and faulty legislation, by politicians and civil servants following political agendas. John HillWhilst Sir Ken appears an extremely conscientious and decent individual, I believe that either he or the law of the land was and remains wrong. Surely, the shooting to death of an innocent man was and still is, under the current law of England & Wales, a criminal offence no matter who it was who pulled the trigger. You failed to put to him the one question that would require the essential answer: "how is the killing of an innocent man by armed police now justified under current legislation?" Mr Kim Sabido Listening to the excellent discussion between Messrs Coleman and MacDonald, it was hard not to see an imbalance between his "hands-off" defence of justice and apparent tolerance of the police shootings (plural).

BBC News | SCI/TECH | Coders prepare son of Napster

Coders prepare son of Napster
Freenet's developers aim to beat censorship
A group of programmers opposed to censorship is working on software that will let people share files over the internet securely and anonymously.
The Freenet program is similar to the popular Napster file-sharing software, but uses a different storage and retrieval system which maintains no central index and does not reveal where the files are stored.
There is no way to create a truly censorship-proof system without making copyright enforcement more difficult
Ian ClarkeFreenet project founder It is designed to present no obvious target for anyone wanting to take action - legal or otherwise - to remove files from the system.
Freenet project founder Ian Clarke recognises the implications: "One of the characteristics of Freenet is that it allows the distribution of information without any fear of censorship or retribution. This will make it largely impossible to prevent violations of copyright.
"There is no way to create a truly censorship-proof system without making copyright enforcement more difficult, and I personally feel that this is a price worth paying," he said.
Legal deadline
The system's designers say that files held in its network are virtually immune to attack. Sounds, pictures, and documents could be stored and shared without users knowing who put them into the system and where they are actually held at any one time.
Though it is still under development, the Freenet program can be downloaded from the project's website. It does not come with the kind of slick installer that might accompany a more mature piece of software, but it does have an add-on which makes it work with a web browser.
Some users of Napster have sought alternatives following the company's legal setbacks. The Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) took Napster to court and won a ruling on 5 March saying copyrighted music held without permission had to be removed.
The RIAA sent Napster a list of 135,000 songs, which the file-sharing service has until Wednesday to remove.
Popular files
Users have flocked to systems like Gnutella, but not without problems. Like Freenet, Gnutella has no central index but it does give away IP addresses, which can be used to trace users.
And response times can be slow as the network struggles to cope with thousands of new users. Freenet should be able to cope with any such surge in popularity because it automatically makes more copies of popular files. Freenet's developers are not fighting writs as yet, but there is no doubt that the music industry is prepared to defend its business.
The British Phonographic Industry, which represents the UK's record companies, says Freenet is not yet a big fish in the file-sharing world, but copyright law should be upheld nevertheless. "It is the right of creators, whether they are musicians, writers, painters, designers or journalists, to be rewarded for their work. Copyright law is vitally important to ensure that these rights are upheld," a BPI spokesman told BBC News Online. Search BBC News Online

Energy review urges barrage study
A review of tidal energy in the Severn estuary is proposed
Environmental groups have welcomed the UK government's caution over the possibility of a Severn barrage.
The energy review, revealed on Tuesday, recommended further study of the �14bn project, but said it would raise "strong environmental concerns".
Friends of the Earth Cymru said that amounted to a rejection of assembly government support for the barrier.
But Welsh Enterprise Minister Andrew Davies said he was delighted there would be a study of Severn tidal power.
HOW TIDE POWER WORKS
As tide comes in, sea water passes through barrage to landward side
At high tide, sluice gates shut, trapping water in estuary or basin
When tide recedes on sea-side of barrage, sluice gates open
Water flows through barrage, driving turbines and generating power
Power can be generated in both directions, but this can affect efficiency and economics of project
The 10-mile (16km) barrier would run from Lavernock Point, near Cardiff, to Brean Down, near Weston-super-Mare.
It is estimated it could provide about 5% of the UK's energy needs by 2020.
Gordon James of Friends of the Earth Cymru said it was "particularly pleased that the environmentally destructive and costly Severn barrage proposal has not won favour".
He added: "We were always surprised that the Welsh Assembly Government supported such a scheme when more cost-effective and environmentally acceptable options, such as tidal lagoons, look more promising."
The RSPB also welcomed the UK government's recognition of the River Severn's environmental value.
The charity said the estuary was "prized" for its importance to wild birds, particularly in winter and during migration, and was of "international importance".
A barrage across the Severn estuary could generate massive amounts of clean, green energy
Welsh Secretary Peter Hain
The energy review stated that while the barrier was "attractive in terms of energy generation," it would "raise strong environmental concerns".
The report went on to recommend further study of "tidal technologies" and their "public acceptability" to use in the estuary.
But Welsh Secretary Peter Hain said no other renewable energy project came close to the proposed tidal barrier.
"A barrage across the Severn estuary could generate massive amounts of clean, green energy - up to 5% of the UK's energy needs," he said.
"The review starkly illustrates the huge challenge we face if we want to achieve energy security over the coming years - and the need for us to make tough choices."
Mr Davies said he was pleased the UK government wanted further research.
"The assembly government fully intends to play a full part in taking this work forward to its next stages. We recognise there is more work to be done," he added.

Man Utd midfielder Michael Carrick signs new contract
Carrick joined United from Tottenham five years ago
Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick has signed a new three-year deal keeping him at the club until the end of the 2013/14 season.The 29-year-old joined from Tottenham in 2006 but has not been in the best form this season, although he has improved in recent games. "I am thoroughly enjoying my time at this great club," said Carrick. "There is a fantastic team spirit within the squad and I am pleased to have committed my future to United." Carrick's appearance in the 2-1 loss to Chelsea on Tuesday was his 218th game for United, and he said he felt confident he could add to the three Premier League titles he has already won in his time at Old Trafford. "We are in a very good position at the moment and I am confident this team will be successful for many years to come," he said. Carrick joins Ryan Giggs and Patrice Evra in pledging his long-term future to the club and with Paul Scholes' future still unclear and Anderson struggling with injuries, he could still have a significant role to play this season. "I am delighted Michael has signed a new contract," said manager Sir Alex Ferguson. "He has been outstanding since joining us from Tottenham in 2006. He is a true professional and it is great he has committed his future to the club."
