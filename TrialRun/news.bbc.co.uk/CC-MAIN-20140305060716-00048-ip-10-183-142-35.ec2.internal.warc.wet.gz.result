California bans same-sex marriage
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
The ruling puts in doubt thousands of same-sex marriages that have taken place in California
Californian voters have chosen to ban same-sex marriage, months after it was legalised by the state's top court.
The measure restricting marriage to heterosexual couples gained 52% support - more than 5.1 million votes - with nearly all precincts declaring results.
Twenty-seven US states already ban same-sex marriage. California's legal approval had seen thousands of gay couples wed there since May.
State Attorney General Jerry Brown has said those marriages will remain valid.
Legal challenges to the measure, known as Proposition 8, are likely.
The referendum called for the California constitution to be amended by adding the phrase that: "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognised in California."
Bitter campaign
The ballot measure was keenly fought with more than $70m spent on advertising by both sides - breaking national records for campaigning on a social policy initiative.
People have stood up because they care about marriage and they care a good deal
Frank Schubert Proposition 8 supporter
The BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles says that for many liberal Californians, on a day when Barack Obama was swept to victory, the election was a bittersweet experience.
He said they won the White House - but lost on an issue many believed had already been resolved by the courts.
Conservative groups have welcomed the ban.
"People believe in the institution of marriage" said Frank Schubert, co-manager of the Yes on 8 campaign.
There has been enormous movement in favour of full equality
Kate KendallLesbian rights campaigner "It's one institution that crosses ethnic divides, that crosses partisan divides."
But gay rights supporters vowed to fight on.
Kate Kendall, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights said "there has been enormous movement in favour of full equality in eight short years".
"That is the direction this is heading, and if it's not today or tomorrow, it will be soon," she added.
Florida and Arizona also backed proposals to ban gay marriage, by 62% and 56% respectively, on 4 November.
Other proposals
The measure was among 153 state-level proposals up for vote on US presidential election day.
Other measures under consideration by 36 states ranged from initiatives on gambling, drug laws and stem cell research to tax laws and affirmative action on race.
There were 59 such initiatives in 2008.
In South Dakota and Colorado, measures curtailing abortion rights were rejected.
Michigan voted to allow medical use of marijuana, while Nebraska voted to end race- and gender-based affirmative action.
In Oregon, a measure designed to limit teaching of students in language other than English to no more than two years was defeated.
Washington state voted to allow doctor-assisted suicide for terminally ill people.
Amid deep economic uncertainty, proposals to cut state income taxes were defeated decisively in North Dakota and Massachusetts.
Missouri repealed a $500 loss limit designed to protect compulsive gamblers on riverboats.

Christian video game draws anger
By Richard Allen Greene
BBC News, Washington
Characters can be carried away by angels
A new Christian video game has sparked calls for a boycott from groups who say it is "training for religious warfare".
The game, Left Behind: Eternal Forces, is based on a wildly successful series of novels about the struggles on earth after true believers ascend to heaven.
Players can command the army of good - the Tribulation Force - against the anti-Christ's Global Community.
The game's makers reject criticism, saying their detractors "have a clear hatred of Biblical Christianity".
An alliance of liberal groups including the Christian Alliance for Progress, the Campaign to Defend the Constitution, and Talk2Action, have urged the giant retailer Wal-Mart, among others, to stop stocking the game, which was released last month.
"It's about religious warfare. The way to win is to convert or kill. You have both the Inquisition and the Crusades," says Frederick Clarkson of Talk2Action.
"Anybody who is not a follower of Jesus is the enemy," he claims.
'Dehumanising the enemy'
Mr Clarkson is particularly concerned that the $39.95 (�20) game - which is rated for teenagers due to violence - is being marketed through churches.
Game excerpts
"Pastors and youth leaders recommend the game to their parishioners," he says, giving its message the stamp of authority.
And that message is the "dehumanisation of the feared other - Catholics, Jews, Muslims, the wrong kind of Protestants, people deemed to be sinners", he says.
That dehumanisation, he warns, is a first step towards genocide.
Jeffrey S Frichner, a co-founder of Left Behind Games, utterly rejects that characterisation of his game.
None of the missions in the game has a "convert-or-die" objective, he insists.
"It's the anti-Christ that desires you to convert or die, and you are defending yourself against that on the good side," he says.
"You will absolutely lose each level and never win the game if you choose physical warfare as a means."
'Evangelising - respectfully'
The word "convert" does not even appear in the game, he adds - and neither does the word "Christian".
"The game itself is just a great game. People of other faiths could play it and not know it's Christian," he says.
Left Behind looks like a typical video game in some respects
He freely admits the game aims to evangelise.
"But it is doing it in a way which is very respectful, not Bible-thumping."
When players successfully complete a level of the real-time strategy game, "you get a vignette that has some kind of Biblical truth and a find-out-more button", he says.
That leads players to a website where they can discuss issues, say a prayer and "become a believer", Mr Frichner says.
He thinks that will appeal to young people.
"People are drawn to things that provide answers. My personal position is that the Bible provides all those answers."
'Summer blockbuster'
Left Behind: Eternal Forces is not the first Christian video game, but it is the most ambitious to date, experts say.
"This is the first Christian developer that tried to produce a triple-A title, the summer blockbuster of video games," says Brian Crecente, editor of the games blog Kotaku and a video games writer for the Rocky Mountain News newspaper.
Video games are no longer just about amusing people, but about trying to send a message
Brian Crecente, Kotaku editor
Send us your reaction
He is intrigued by the moral complexity of the game, which he saw played late in development, before its release.
"Your characters can do physical combat, but when they do, they lose morale and have a greater chance of becoming evil.
"In some sense, that can represent what happens. In the real world, you can't get involved in a gunfight and walk away and forget it."
He is critical of the game on other grounds, though, saying that in trying to deliver entertainment as well as a message, the developers have fallen short on both.
"It's a muddled message and a kind-of entertaining game," he says.
Kill the president
It is not the only violent video game with a message raising concern this holiday season.
Tony Blair and Iraq's prime minister are targets in Quest for Bush
The Global Islamic Media Front has released a game called Quest for Bush, in which players aim to kill the US president.
Adam Raisman, an analyst at the Search for International Terrorist Entities (Site) Institute who has played the game, calls the free download "propaganda", but stops short of labelling it recruitment.
"We can't say this is preparation for jihad, but it puts out the idea that you can walk around with a gun and shoot American soldiers," he says.
"It is putting the thought in your head that Bush, Blair and Rumsfeld are the guys you're going after."
Mr Crecente, the games writer, has not seen Quest for Bush (also known as Night of Bush Hunting, the literal translation of its Arabic title).
But he says both it and Left Behind: Eternal Forces are part of an effort in the gaming world to deal with important issues.
"Whenever games take on something important, they are accused of trivialising the subject," he says.
"This shows that video games have gotten past the birthing pains. They are no longer just about amusing people, but about trying to send a message." What do you think of the controversy? Send us your comments with the link below:

One in 10 was shot, age was no barrier
Those who deserted stood to be executed
A memorial has been unveiled to the hundreds of British soldiers shot by their own side during WWI. It depicts Private Herbert Burden, one of the youngest of the executed men.
At 17, Private Herbert Burden was legally too young to be facing the German guns in the trenches of the Western front. However, his age did not save the teenager from facing a deadly volley of bullets on the morning of 21 July 1915 - fired by his own comrades.
The memorial, which depicts Private Herbert Burden
Burden was one of the more than 300 British and Commonwealth soldiers to be executed by firing squad during World War One.
Though the British military handed out death sentences for an array of offences - including murder - most of those executed on the Western front had been found guilty of desertion or "cowardice".
An absence of little more than 48 hours saw Private Herbert Burden brought before a Field General Court Martial, pleading for his very life.
While stationed behind the lines, near the Ypres Salient, Burden had left his regiment, the Northumberland Fusiliers, with permission to visit a friend in a neighbouring unit.
Head for the front
"I heard he had lost a brother. I wanted to inquire if it was true or not," the teenager told his military judges.
A plaque to one of the hundreds shot by their own side
The officers considering Burden's fate heard that the boy's unit had been issued orders to make for the front just before he went missing.
"Burden was warned for duty with a working party. Their duty was to dig at night in the vicinity of the firing line... liable to the usual dangers to be met with in the vicinity of the trenches," testified the boy's officer Lieutenant Colonel Clement Yatman. It seems that although Burden had been a soldier for some considerable time, possibly enlisting as a drummer boy prior to the outbreak of the war, he had not seen any major action.
Asked to comment on his subordinate's character, Col. Yatman said neither he nor any of his officers knew the accused, but added that Burden was "of inferior physique, reported as untrustworthy".
The Army shot them to stiffen moral after a major cock-up or when they were about to launch a major attack
Julian Putkowski
It seems Burden was also sickly, having spent at least 11 days of his three months in France in hospital. Indeed, army doctors had only discharged him the day before he was ordered to the front lines.
On 2 July 1915, a guilty verdict was passed and Burden's death sentence was sent up through the chain of command to be approved.
While admitting that the fighting spirit of his men was good, Brigadier General Douglas-Smith said a few other cases of desertion had occurred in the area and "the death penalty is the only means by which it can be stopped".
A former soldier observes a minute's silence at the remembrance service
It seems Private Burden was to be made an example of, says historian Julian Putkowski, co-author of Shot At Dawn.
"Only one in 10 of the 3,000 men sentenced to death were actually shot. The Army shot them to stiffen moral after a major cock-up or when they were about to launch a major attack."
Burden's last day was scheduled to coincide with another assault on the German positions along the Ypres Salient.
"It seems the Army executed only every 10th condemned man because it thought that was all public opinion would stand," says Mr Putkowski.
Hauled off
It was common for condemned men to be returned to their units, often to fight in the trenches, while awaiting their fate, says Mr Putkowski.
Last year, deserters were recognised for the first time at Remembrance Sunday
"They would then be hauled off to a barn or out building. There a chaplain - often in a worse state than the condemned man - would come along for the 'death watch'. A doctor might offer them a half grain of morphine to knock the man out."
At sunrise on 21 July, Burden may well have been brought before a firing squad taken from the ranks of his own friends, says Mr Putkowski.
"Some of the condemned knew their executioners. One man even called out: 'Make it a good one, Jim'." Facing certain death, soldiers such as Private Burden reacted in a number of ways.
"Some were hysterical, screeching, some seemed comatose. Others would take it fatalistically, knowing their comrades would possibly be dead soon anyway."
The blank round
The firing squad's rifles would have been loaded by an NCO, with one of the weapons being primed with a blank round - the thinking being that the marksman could cling to the hope they had not fired a fatal shot.
"A blank round sounds completely different to a live one and because it's not propelling anything there's no 'kick' either," says Mr Putkowski. "The firer would have known which was which. It was just intended as consolation." Although his age was officially recorded as 19 when he died, it seems Burden was only 17 and had presumably lied so he could see active service abroad.
Mr Putkowski says it's likely the Army colluded in this deception, since Burden's real age would have been known to recruits when he first signed up before the war.
"They must have known he was underage, but he was executed anyway." Search BBC News Online

Tributes paid to BBC TV's Cotton
Sir Bill Cotton was a former controller of BBC One
Obituary: Sir Bill CottonCotton 'had golden touch'Send us your comments
Tributes have been paid to Sir Bill Cotton, the BBC's former head of light entertainment and controller of BBC One, who has died aged 80.
Sir Bill oversaw some of the BBC's most popular TV shows in the 70s, including Dad's Army and The Generation Game.
Host Bruce Forsyth said: "He gave the public what they wanted," adding that "it's a very sad day to lose him".
Dad's Army writer David Croft said Sir Bill was the "master jeweller" in the "golden age" of television.
Mr Forsyth added: "He knew about television. "He was responsible for what I think was the golden age of BBC television, which we'll never have again.
'Wonderful showman'
"He knew what the public wanted, and he gave the public what they wanted.

"He knew how to treat performers. He knew how to talk to them, how to get them to do things even if they didn't want to. He talked them into it because he knew it would be good for them," said the entertainer.
Mr Croft said there had been opposition to creating his comedy show, which was about the Home Guard during World War II, because of fears it would cause offence.
"Without him I don't think the show would have gone on. He undoubtedly had a nose for a hit," Mr Croft said.
"He was a wonderful showman and a great believer in his producers and he backed us absolutely to the hilt.
"He was an entrepreneur... and there's not many of his type about any more, I'm afraid. We shall miss him terribly. I loved him."
Sir Bill presided over The Morecambe and Wise Show
Sir Bill, the son of big band leader Billy Cotton, joined the BBC in 1956 as an in-house producer of light entertainment programmes, working on shows including the Billy Cotton Band Show and music programme Six-Five Special.
He was the BBC's head of light entertainment between 1970 and 1977, before being put in charge of BBC One, a post he held for four years.
He then went on to serve as the BBC's managing director of television from 1981 until his retirement.
Sir Bill was awarded the Academy Fellowship by Bafta in 1998 and was knighted in 2001.
'Giant of TV'
Speaking in 2000, Sir Bill said light entertainment on television had formed part of the nation's culture.
"Basically, fundamentally, television was a performer's medium and news and current affairs were the sideshow," he said.
"One of the reasons that I honestly believe that the care taken on light entertainment had to be the same care as was taken for ballet, or opera, or serious drama, is because you are contributing to the culture of the country. I think it's sad if it isn't."

Mark Thompson, director general of the BBC, said Sir Bill was "one of the giants of BBC television" who had brought "countless programmes to the screen which themselves became legends".
"He was both a great impresario and also a passionate believer in public service broadcasting."
Alan Yentob, creative director of the BBC, called Sir Bill "an inspirational broadcaster".
"Under his leadership in the 70s the BBC commissioned and produced a raft of entertainment and comedy which set a benchmark for these genres which has rarely been surpassed.
"From Monty Python to Morecambe and Wise, from The Generation Game to Dad's Army, these shows and others like them have helped to define not just a genre but a generation," added Mr Yentob.

Ore's World Cup diary: Part 1
I'm out in South Africa, taking Newsround to the centre of the World Cup action. I'm sending messages and film clips as I go along - and you'll find them here."Also, we would totally love to hear from you guys! So send me your questions and predictions using the form on the right and I'll reply to as many as I can." TUESDAY 7AM: After a few days in South Africa, Ore's getting he settled in but he just can't wait for the World Cup's opening game on Friday! He's even had special access to see Soccer City stadium..."It's like being on the blocks of the 100 metres: 'On your marks.. Get set...' then instead of hearing the starting gun, there's an agonisingly long pause! The World Cup's opening game is almost within touching distance now and basically I feel like a donkey with a juicy World Cup carrot dangling in front off my face that I'm not allowed to bite into yet! Ore gets into Soccer City!
I just can't wait for kick-off on Friday! Carrots aren't actually my favourite vegetable (it's parsnips... roasted... with gravy) but after visiting into Soccer City, South Africa's centrepiece stadium for the tournament, and seeing an ocean of 94,000 orange seats you could have given me a carrot and I would have eaten it like an ice lolly on a sweltering hot day! Walking in and around the ground, we got a taste of just what we're in for over the next month and a bit. There was still a bit of work being done in preparation for Friday but when the finishing touches are added I'm sure it will be one of the world's best stadiums. Ore at the World Cup fan shop
And the pitch looked in perfect condition - I should know..I was allowed to walk on the grass and sit at one of the cameras that will film throughout the World Cup, including the final - amazing! (Keep an eye out for it on this week's Sportsround). On our way out, we thought we were under attack from the air when various planes and jets nearly shaved off a layer of my hair - they were flying that low. For about 20 minutes groups of planes flew in formation, practising loop-the-loops, dips, dives and loads of other cool moves. It had everyone on the ground looking up. If we can look forward to more of that in Friday's opening ceremony then that's just another reason I really want to get this World Cup party started!" Ore
MONDAY at 12.00pm - Ore is fully accredited for the World Cup and this is his special badge that gets him into the Soccer City Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa.
Ore holds up his special reporter's pass to the World Cup and you can see the stadium behind it.
SUNDAY at 6.25 pm - Newsround's World Cup adventure has begun. The good news is that Ore has arrived, the bad news is that his luggage hasn't!
Where's me stuff?
SUNDAY at 5pm: Ore sounds like he's pretty excited about his first full day in South Africa, after a very eventful journey all the way from the UK..."We don't get the first class flight, the hero-like reception or the luxury accommodation with all the trimmings (I know, it's not fair)... but it definitely seems like we've set off on our own World Cup Journey. Just like Fabio Capello's men, we've been building up for this trip for months and I almost have to pinch myself to really believe that I'm here in South Africa, ready to watch the 19th Football World Cup Finals up close. And like the England's 23 players that arrived in Johannesburg last week, we've already had our fair share of problems too. It wasn't quite to the scale of the England captain's devastating injury, but oversized luggage at the flight check-in desk forced us into a last-minute panic to re-pack, frantically stuffing clothes and shoes (mostly mine) into different suitcases. Then I was 'lucky' enough to be randomly selected for a full body security scan! I remember reporting on these for Newsround, and there were some people that didn't like the scanners because, well unlike an x-ray let's say they show off a little more of the body than you'd like. Read more about the body scanners
Soon enough, though, we were on the plane and in the air. I think it's fairly well known that I can sleep anywhere and before I knew it the 11 hour flight from London had been and gone and we'd touched down in South Africa.
So now, after a day getting used to our surroundings in Johannesburg, you could say - like the England squad - we've got used to performing at altitude. In pics: Ore is off to South Africa!
Tomorrow it's time to do the talking on the pitch and play... literally! We get to visit the 90,000 seat Soccer City Stadium, where the World Cup party kicks off on Friday. I can't wait!" Ore
SATURDAY 8PM: After a late start Ore's managed to pack his suitcase, get himself to the airport and get checked in...

FRIDAY 5PM: Ore starts packing up his things and saying his goodbyes to the Newsround office, and to his presenting buddy Sonali. Only one day before he flies to South Africa!
