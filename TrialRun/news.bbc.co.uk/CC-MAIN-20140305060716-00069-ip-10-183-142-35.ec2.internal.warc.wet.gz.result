Gaddafi attacks Obama on Israel
Col Gaddafi was conciliatory up until his comments about candidate Obama
Libya's leader has strongly criticised US presidential candidate Barack Obama for saying Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital of Israel. Col Muammar Gaddafi said he was either ignorant of the Middle East conflict or lying to boost his campaign. Mr Obama was speaking to pro-Israel lobbyists in the US last week. Referring to him as "our Kenyan brother", Col Gaddafi also said Mr Obama might suffer from an inferiority complex because of his African origins. The issue of race could make Mr Obama's behaviour "more white than white people", Col Gaddafi suggested, rather than acting in solidarity with African and Arab nations. The comments came during a speech to mark the 38th anniversary since the US evacuated Wheelus Air Force base in Tripoli. Israel claims Jerusalem as its "eternal, undivided" capital, but the Palestinians want the eastern half - occupied by Israel in 1967 - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The Americans left Libya shortly after Col Gaddafi came into power in a bloodless coup in 1969. 'Campaign lie'
The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli says the speech was a passionate critique of past US policies towards Libya but emphasised that current relations are not confrontational. We tell him to be proud of himself as a black and feel that all Africa is behind him
Col Gaddafi
History of US-Libya ties
However, Col Gaddafi's defiant and famously politically incorrect rhetoric returned when talking about Mr Obama towards the end of the speech. "The statements of our Kenyan brother of American nationality Obama on Jerusalem... show that he either ignores international politics and did not study the Middle East conflict or that it is a campaign lie," he said. "We fear that Obama will feel that, because he is black with an inferiority complex, this will make him behave worse than the whites." "This will be a tragedy," Gaddafi said. "We tell him to be proud of himself as a black and feel that all Africa is behind him." Conspiracy theory
Mr Obama's epic primary campaign against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton ended in his victory early this month. The presidential election will be in November. Correspondents say he has largely avoided playing on past racial struggles in the US and has drawn support among black and white Americans. In addition, Mr Gaddafi suggested Mr Obama's comments may have been informed by a fear of assassination by Israeli agents, "the same fate as [former US President John F] Kennedy when he promised to look into Israel's nuclear programme". Conspiracy theories abound about Kennedy's assassination in 1963. An inquiry led by the chief justice of the US Supreme Court found that the shooting was carried out by a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald.

Have Your Say: repossession
Nobody here but us pigeons. Should repossession only be a last resort?
Mortgage arrears are on the rise, but the courts may be too hasty to give lenders the right to sell people's homes and turf them out, according to the Financial Services Consumer panel, which advises the Financial Services Authority.
They say homeowners are finding they may be evicted because lawyers are not aware of the FSA's rules surrounding repossessions.
Perhaps you have been to court following a repossession order, or even had your home repossessed.
Were you advised about all of your options or did you feel pressurised?
What has your experience been of dealing with lenders seeking to repossess a property?
We asked for your comments - a selection of which are below - the debate is now closed.
It seems to be a sign of the times that individuals are unwilling to take responsibility for their actions - buying a house is a risky thing to do. It is also not a God given right to own a house. If you cannot afford to take the risk why not rent like most of continental Europe? If individuals want the opportunity to make big profits from house price inflation then they had better realise that there are risks attached to the deal too. The only complaint that people can have is a lack of financial education - that is another topic - but don't expect the banks to bail you out because you choose to take risks.Paul Ogden, London
The lender should be required to provide independent advice for the borrower
Celia Burgess, Lymington Hampshire
I was a CAB Manager for 16 years including the 1990s when many homes were repossessed. Most people don't understand the legal process and don't think they can influence the court decision. Judges don't like making people homeless and as long as people can make the agreed loan repayments, the time taken to repay the capital can be adjusted. All it takes is a realistic and acceptable income and expenditure statement and an explanation to the judge - not something people can do without practice, but not difficult to learn and once learned, never forgotten. Don't be so silly as to say "It is up to the defendant's lawyer to make the relevant points to the judge." If the defendant can afford a solicitor s/he will be halfway there. There is no legal aid for anyone earning more than basic benefits and most people cannot hope to retain a solicitor. The lender should be required to provide independent advice for the borrower (CAB and other advice services could do so relatively cheaply) without which the judge should refuse to grant repossession. Celia Burgess, Lymington Hampshire
I have acted as a lawyer in scores of repossession cases. The reason that these FSA rules are not argued in court is that they do not have precedence over the relevant statutes (The Administration of Justice Acts 1970 and 1973). The lender becomes entitled to possession once the arrears total two months. Lenders are not obliged to negotiate with the borrowers. It is worth remembering that many possession orders are suspended by the courts. Unconditional possession orders are usually only ever obtained where the Defendant does not attend court (which, amazingly, often happens). Where I do have sympathy with borrowers is with the difficulty in obtaining legal aid. Where Defendants are represented I have never heard them argue that the lender has breached these FSA rules. I would be amazed if that were because CAB and the like were unaware of them. There are no parallel systems of law. The FSA is as much use a wet paper bag as the Northern Rock saga shows.Nicholas Bryars, Leicester
The whole thing is biased on the side of the people with the most money
Peter Jay, Daventry
In your programme you mentioned the idea that lawyers on either side should be aware of the FSA guidelines. The plain fact is that people who have defaulted on their mortgage payments will, almost by definition, not have any money to hire lawyers. The unsuspecting individuals in this situation can end up being railroaded into situations without knowing their rights. The CAB is quite often a great help but they are not qualified lawyers. They are very good at being articulate on behalf of the borrower but may not be as practiced at the legal arguments. In the recent proceedings that were brought against me I was left to defend myself against the mortgage company's legal representative who was very aggressive. I ended up with a "Deferred Possession Order" but only because I am not intimidated easily. The whole thing is biased on the side of the people with the most money i.e. the mortgage company.Peter Jay, Daventry
Lenders have no responsibility for any risk incurred by loans. Reverse this and lenders will pay more attention to the ratio between value of property, amount loaned and ability to pay. This needs legislation. This would help to have realistically valued and priced properties. At present the borrower is obliged, most of the time, to pay the shortfall after the sale of a repossessed property. How fair is that? Lenders are laughing all the way to the bank, their lack of responsibility rewarded.Michele Poole, Worcester
I must first say that I've never had a mortgage. I assume the when someone takes out a mortgage he/she signs an agreement/contract. Are the FSA's rules not mentioned on this? If so, shouldn't the Judge then take those rules into consideration? If the rules are not mentioned, then perhaps they should be.Geoff Southcott, Southampton The comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the BBC but will reflect the balance of views we have received.

Legal threat closes postcode feed
The Royal Mail owns and maintains the database of postcodes
Websites that help people find jobs or hospitals have been hit by legal action threatened by the Royal Mail.The threat was issued against the company supplying them, and many other sites, with postcode data. Royal Mail said the legal action was threatened to stop "unauthorised access" to the postcode data. Ernestmarples.com, which supplied the address data, said it did not have the resources to fight a legal battle so has turned off its feed. Sites affected by the withdrawal of data include Job Centre Pro Plus, HealthWare (locates nearby pharmacies and hospitals), Planning alerts.com (monitors planning applications), Straight Choice (finds out who sent political leaflets) and many more. Commenting on its action the Royal Mail said: "We have not asked anyone to close down a website. "We have simply asked a third party to stop allowing unauthorised access to Royal Mail data, in contravention of our intellectual property rights," it added in a statement. The third party was Ernestmarples.com which supplied postcode data to the sites. Typically those wanting to use the regularly updated list of 1.7 million postcodes pay the Royal Mail for access. Many of the sites hit by the action are volunteer efforts that would be unable to afford the licence fees - about £4000 per annum for unlimited access. Harry Metcalfe, co-founder of Ernestmarples.com, declined to say how it got access to the postcode data. "There are certain legal questions around the specifics of what we are doing," Mr Metcalfe told BBC News. "The advice we have received so far is that allowing the service to continue operating while we attempt to resolve this issue would be unwise." In the interim, the company is searching for alternative free sources of postcode data even though those are known to be less accurate and not as regularly updated. Mr Metcalfe said Ernestmarples.com would talk to the Royal Mail about getting access to the full postcode data. Ernestmarples.com is named after the post master general who oversaw the introduction of postcodes in 1959. Jim Killock, head of the Open Rights Group which campaigns on digital issues, said the action showed why the UK needed a more open approach to official data. "It is easy to see that large numbers of small business ideas and not for profit services are being blocked by these licence fees," he said. "It is in effect a tax on innovation."
