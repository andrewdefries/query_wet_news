Texas carries out 400th execution
Conner asked for forgiveness before he was put to his death
Texas has carried out its 400th execution since the US Supreme Court reintroduced the death penalty in 1976.
Johnny Ray Conner, 32, was put to death by lethal injection for the 1998 fatal shooting of a grocery store clerk.
Conner was pronounced dead at 1820 (2320 GMT), eight minutes after the lethal mix of drugs was injected.
Earlier this week, the EU urged Texas to end the "cruel and inhumane" practice. Texas's governor said it was a "just and appropriate" punishment.
System 'broken'
Members of Conner's family and that of the victim, Kathyanna Nguyen, witnessed the execution through windows in the death chamber.
Before he was put to death, Conner - who had always maintained his innocence - asked for forgiveness and expressed love to his family and Ms Nguyen's family.
"What is happening to me is unjust and the system is broken," he said in his final statement.
His final words were: "I bear witness there is no God but Allah and the Prophet Muhammad. Unto Allah, I belong, unto Allah I return. I love you."
Texans long ago decided the death penalty is a just and appropriate punishment for the most horrible crimes committed against our citizens
Spokesman for Texas Governor Rick Perry
In 2005, a judge overturned Conner's death sentence and ordered a retrial, saying Conner's lawyers had been ineffective, but a federal appeals court reversed that decision in January. On Tuesday, the EU expressed "great regret" at the execution.
"There is no evidence to suggest that the use of the death penalty serves as a deterrent against violent crime," it said.
But Texas Governor Rick Perry told the EU to mind its own business.
Robert Black, a spokesman for Mr Perry, told the BBC News website: "Two hundred and thirty years ago, our forefathers fought a war to throw off the yoke of a European monarch and gain the freedom of self-determination. "Texans long ago decided the death penalty is a just and appropriate punishment for the most horrible crimes committed against our citizens. "While we respect our friends in Europe... Texans are doing just fine governing Texas." The Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center says the US has executed more than 1,090 prisoners since 1976.
Texas carried out more than a third of those.

West Antarctic glaciers speed up
Eventually the ice will make its way out into the ocean
Many glaciers in West Antarctica have substantially increased their rate of shrinkage compared with the 1990s.
US-Chilean teams report to the journal Science that the glaciers are losing 60% more ice into the Amundsen Sea than they accumulate from inland snowfall.
They say the ice loss corresponds to an annual sea-level rise of 0.2mm, or more than 10% of the total global increase of about 1.8mm per year.
The study incorporates satellite data and measurements from aircraft.
It also shows the glaciers are moving faster. One, the Pine Island Glacier, has sped up by about 25% over the last 30 years.
Bob Thomas, who is attached to the US space agency's (Nasa) Wallops Flight Facility and one of the authors on the Science report, cautions that the observed changes apply to only a short time period.
It is too early, he says, to tell if the accelerated thinning is part of a natural cycle or is a sign of a longer-term change. "Continued observation is important," he added.
Amundsen Sea glaciers are fracturing as they race along
And Eric Rignot, a study participant from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said: "The rates of glacier change remain relatively small at present... But the potential exists for these glaciers to increase global sea level by more than one metre. "The time scale over which this will take place depends on how much faster the glaciers can flow, which we do not know at present."
A major factor will be the behaviour of the huge ice shelves that the glaciers flow into before reaching the sea. This has been illustrated by a separate piece of research published earlier this week in Geophysical Research Letters. It demonstrated how glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula once bounded by the Larson B shelf, which collapsed in 2002, are now flowing significantly faster into the Weddell Sea.

Queen honours 'forgotten' soldiers
Poppies were released during the inauguration
A memorial honouring the "forgotten contribution" of almost five million people from Africa, the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent during both world wars has been inaugurated by the Queen.
Serving soldiers and veterans from Bangladesh, India, Jamaica, Nepal, Nigeria and Pakistan attended the ceremony at the Memorial Gates on Constitution Hill, London, on Wednesday. During a minute's silence a mass of poppies were released from bronze urns on top of the gates.
Construction of the gates began in October 2001 after a campaign set up in 1998 to acknowledge the volunteers.
:
Veterans of Empire
The "forgotten" soldiers tell their stories
During the ceremony the Queen met veteran Umrao Singh, who received the Victoria Cross for action in Burma.
She also met Suleiman Omer Kujog, the son of a Somali sergeant who was killed in action. Mr Kujog, 64, said it should have been constructed earlier.
Rajimbar Singh Dhatt served Britain in 1941
"It was too late. It should've happened before," he said.
"It reminds me of my father. It reminds me of the time I was one and I grew up as an orphan. It reminds me of the evils of war."
The ceremony included a mounted escort from India and Pakistan and a lament by the pipers of the Royal Gurkha Rifles.
Baroness Flather, of the Memorial Gates Trust, which raised �2.7m towards the monument, told the BBC the contribution of millions of volunteers from Africa, the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent had been largely overlooked.
She said: "Somehow they have been erased from the memory of people here. "We need to inform the young ethnic minority children about this contribution. We need to inform everybody else as well."
Rajimbar Singh Dhatt from Hounslow, west London, agreed the memorial was long overdue.
"This is very important for us. It's important for the new population because it shows the multiracial and multicultural society." WATCH/LISTEN
