China brands Chen 'troublemaker'
President Chen has signalled a harder line towards China
China has branded Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian a "troublemaker and saboteur" for a speech hinting at formalising Taiwan's independence.
Mr Chen suggested last month that it might be time to consider scrapping Taiwan's guidelines on unification.
In China's first official response, a spokesman said such a move would break a promise made by Mr Chen in 2000. China sees Taiwan as its territory, threatening to use force if the island moves towards formal independence.
Mr Chen suggested late last month that the time had come to seriously consider scrapping the National Unification Council and its National Unification Guidelines, in a speech which created diplomatic and political shockwaves. The Council was set up in 1990 as an attempt to convince the Chinese authorities that Taiwan was committed to reunification, and it helped kick-start landmark talks between the two sides in the early 1990s. Harder line
Mr Chen's independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has always opposed the Council, but Mr Chen promised when he first took office in 2000 that he would not scrap it or its guidelines.
Correspondents say Mr Chen's speech was signalling a harder line towards China, although Taiwanese government officials have tried to play down the comments. On Wednesday, Li Weiyi, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said Mr Chen's speech showed he remained committed to moving the island towards formal independence.
Mr Li said Mr Chen was "the troublemaker and saboteur of cross-Straits ties and Asia-Pacific peace and stability".
Taiwan's government responded swiftly to the comments.
Joseph Wu, head of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, said China not Taiwan was the "troublemaker".
"Over the past six years, we have tried to maintain the status quo of the Taiwan Strait, but China has kept stepping up its arms build-up," he said.

Big Brother finalists sell their stories
Jade has continued her bitching outside the house
The last four contestants may have left the Channel 4 reality show Big Brother but they are still enjoying their 15 minutes of fame as tabloid newspapers snap up their exclusive stories.
Although IT worker Kate Lawler, 22, walked away with the �70,000 prize money during the live final on Friday, watched by 9.9 million people, there has been just as much interest in the life story of Jade Goody.
Jade, a 21-year-old dental nurse from Bermondsey, south London, has kept audiences entertained during 64-day stay in the house with her bitchiness and slim grasp of general knowledge.
I wondered really could anyone be quite so daft at times
Alex Sibley
But speaking in the News of the World, Jade puts her lack of education down to the fact that she was often off school helping her disabled mum Jackiey, who lost a hand and the sight in one eye in a motorbike accident.
"I was only young so I had to learn to cook, clean, iron and even wire plugs. There were times when it was hard. Other girls would be out playing after school but I'd be up until 3am sometimes doing mum's hair," she said.
Geography lessons
"But then I'd have to go to school and sometimes I'd be so worn out I would fall asleep on the desk. Even when I was awake I couldn't concentrate on lessons.
Kate and Jonny became close friends
"I missed a bit of school because of her and because of that I wouldn't know about a few things like geography, or history or a few famous people like Mother Theresa."
Jade, who was the first to be evicted on Friday after collecting the least votes from the public choosing who it wanted to win, had good words to say about the majority of her fellow Big Brother contestants.
She said she felt guilty about the way she had treated Sophie Pritchard, the recruitment advisor from Buckinghamshire, but she was less than impressed with winner Kate.
She said: "I could never trust her. One minute she'd talk me, the next she'd be off with me."
Runner-up Jonny Regan, a firefighter from County Durham, was more complementary about Kate.
"Kate's a 'geezer bird'. She's blonde and feminine but she's also the kind of girl you could taken to the pub and have a drink with as mates," the 29-year-old told the Sunday Mirror.
Alex Sibley has regrets about some of his on-screen behaviour
He admitted he found Jade harder to deal with but was concerned he had not protected the vulnerable housemate more.
"Jade drove me mad. She should be in a porno magazine. When she stripped off in the drinking game, I was horrified.
Worries
"The next day I felt ashamed that I hadn't stopped her from getting naked on national television. I apologised to her and she said not to worry about it."
Third placed contestant Alex Sibley, a model from Essex, said he was worried for Jade now she has left the confines of the house.
"I personally think it will affect jade. People are going to be saying this and that about her and Jade will see what has been said about her," he told the Sunday Express.
Kate's victory was watched by 9.9 million people
But he added: "Sometimes I got so frustrated with her. I wondered really could anyone be quite so daft at times."
At times, Alex seemed the least comfortable in the house and he admits he is not sure whether it was a good idea for him to enter the competition.
He said: "In some ways yes I do regret doing Big Brother but in others I don't. My main regret was the last shower with the nudity - that upset my mum, but I can't go back."
Winner Kate, from Beckenham, south London, has been keeping a low profile since her triumphant exit and has not yet sold her story.

Europe ice mission failure probed
By Helen Briggs
BBC News science reporter, Frascati
How the Cryosat launch should have worked Space agencies are investigating why a rocket carrying a European mission to map polar ice fell into the ocean.
The European Space Agency's Cryosat spacecraft was lost minutes after lift-off from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northern Russia on Saturday.
Russian officials say an error caused the rocket's second stage to run out of fuel, so it could not eject the satellite. The �90m (135m euro) craft was designed to monitor how the Earth's ice masses are responding to climate change.
The Esa satellite was launched at 1902 local time (1602 BST), but mission controllers failed to make contact with the spacecraft as planned some two hours later.
The Russians said that the spacecraft, together with the second and third stages of its rocket, had fallen into the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland. 'Risky business'
The satellite was launched on a Rockot vehicle, a converted SS-19 intercontinental ballistic missile. The rocket, which in the Cold War would have been armed with nuclear weapons, had been modified with the addition of a Breeze-KM upper stage. Early indications suggest a missing command from the onboard flight system caused the mission to fail.
It is understood further Rockot launches have now been put on hold while the investigation is carried out.
The loss of Cryosat brings an uncertain future for the teams of scientists and engineers working on the mission.
It was proposed in 1998 by Duncan Wingham, of University College London, UK, to provide more reliable data on climate change. Cryosat had a main mission goal of studying the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, which appears to be thinning rapidly. Professor Wingham said there was no other satellite like it on the books.
"Space is a risky business, it always has been, it doesn't always go perfectly," he said. "We just have to think about where we go from today."
Competing science
Any moves to rebuild the mission now rest on funding.
Ministers from member states must decide in December how much money to commit to Esa's science programme. But any "Cryosat 2" will face stiff competition from other projects, such as a future robotic mission to Mars.
THE EARTH'S ICE COVER
Two types of polar ice: The ice that covers land and the ice that floats on the sea
The large Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets cover 10% of the Earth's land area
Surface measurements and overflights suggest Greenland's ice is undergoing melting
Data from the Antarctic points to melting at the edges and some growth in central regions
Considerable thinning of Arctic sea ice has been recorded by nuclear subs since the 1950s
Observations from space are more extensive, but overall there remains a paucity of data
What we know now about ice
Arctic ice 'disappearing fast'
Mark Drinkwater, Cryosat mission scientist at Esa, said there was an urgent need to formulate a plan on whether it was possible to rebuild Cryosat. "I hope that we can convey the message that this is a fundamentally important mission and that we can in some way recover the situation," he told the BBC News website.
"But I think it would be right to say that we would be looking at a minimum of two to three years to recover the situation, particularly in view of the fact that we also have to reconsider the situation with the launch vehicle."
Cryosat was to be the first in a series of Earth Explorer missions planned by Esa. The satellite missions are designed to be quicker and cheaper than their predecessor, Envisat, a giant Earth-monitoring spacecraft that took more than a decade to build.
The second Earth Explorer, a satellite to measure the Earth's gravitational field, is due to be launched on a Rockot vehicle next year.
The launcher had flown six successful missions before the loss of Cryosat, its first Esa payload.

Are the English in Wales 'outsiders'?
The Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan has warned nationalists not to pander to extremists who are against English people moving to Wales.
His address to the National Eisteddfod in Denbigh, follows comments by the former chairman of the Welsh Language Board, John Elfed Jones.
Mr Jones described "outsiders" moving to Wales as carriers of "human foot-and-mouth disease" and a threat to Welsh language communities. The comments have been criticised as inflammatory and there are worries that the issues could divide Wales into English- versus Welsh-speaking communities
Should people moving into Welsh-speaking communities learn the language?
Whatever nationality you are, do John Elfed Jones' comments offend you?
This Talking Point has now closed. Read a selection of your comments below.
The Welsh language underlies the very fabric of many Welsh communities G. John,
Wales
Some people may find the comments made by S. Glyn and John E. Jones 'inflammatory' but this sort of rhetoric is necessary to gain public and media attention to a crucial issue. The Welsh language underlies the very fabric of many Welsh communities and therefore must be safeguarded. G. John,
Wales
So Wales is full of outsiders? Funny, I though it was England that is full of the Welsh. After Ann Robinson's comments on Room 101 earlier this year, there was an outcry with demands for her prosecution for being racist. John Elfed Jones's remark is exactly the same. Will the police in Wales investigate him? I doubt it. Darren,
UK
This is the problem with nationalism.
Nationalists start picking who is an acceptable
'national' and who isn't.
The problem for the Welsh language is that 50 years ago 15% of the population spoke
Welsh and now 8% do. Welsh is going the way
of Cornish unlike Gaelic which has always had
a vibrant culture (it has never required a Gaelic Language Society)
to keep it alive. Brian,
UK
Regardless of English being the most powerful and widespread language in the world, every nation which has its own language has a right to protect and preserve it. There are parts of Wales even today where 80% of the population is Welsh speaking. Employing a non Welsh speaker in the public sector in these areas would be crazy, and certainly wouldn't be a case of racism.
Bedwyr Williams,
Wales
I lived in mid-Wales for 11 years and by far most of the Welsh people I knew spoke English themselves! The first thing the chairman of the Welsh Language Board should do is try and motivate Welsh youngsters to actually want to use their own language before casting assertions about the English.
Malcolm,
UK
I feel quite offended by this man's comments Dan,
UK
Speaking as someone who has lived in Wales and learnt the language, I feel quite offended by this man's comments. I made an effort to learn Welsh and was still treated poorly by Nationalists. I feel his words will do nothing to help the language and will in fact produce a greater divide between the English and the Welsh. If you want the real reason why the Welsh language is dying, you need look no further than America. Because America is the most powerful nation, and is English speaking, English is naturally being forced upon other countries. Even France is having trouble preserving certain aspects of the language due to the American influence. I think Mr Jones should face up to the fact that the language is dying and try to think of constructive ways of promoting it, rather than using the problem as an excuse for racism.
Dan,
UK
John Elfed Jones' comments certainly offend me. Being Welsh has NOTHING to do with what language one speaks - whether Welsh, English, Urdu, French or anything else. The devolving of power in Wales was for reasons of subsidiarity - not some platform for crazed nationalistic idealists who are still holding prejudices from events that occurred centuries ago.
Simon Watkins,
Wales, UK
Speaking as a Welshman I think Mr Jones is an idiot!
Stuart Dawson,
Hong Kong
English settlers in rural areas of Wales are mainly wealthier than the locals Martin Morgan,
UK
English settlers in rural areas of Wales are mainly wealthier than the locals and by dint of this come to exert economic power over them. When they integrate themselves into local society, such as by learning/respecting the language, hiring local people etc, they are made welcome. But so many of them develop enclaves that threaten to undermine a fragile way of life - such as the widely-reported case of the man in Blaenau Ffestiniog who sought workers from Essex for his building business because he didn't want to hire the Welsh. The answer to the problem is economic development, to ensure that local people have a chance to develop the communities and reduce the economic imbalance. I often get the impression from the media that multi-cultural diversity is a good thing and to be nurtured - except when it applies to the Welsh.
Martin Morgan,
UK
John Elfed Jones is speaking the language of hate and as a leader in his community, should be held personally responsible for any unfortunate results of his declarations.
Tony Gannaway,
USA
As a Welshman living in a non-English speaking country, I feel particularly qualified to comment on this.
I can easily get by speaking only English here, as almost everyone speaks, or at least understands it. However, I have considered it only proper that I endeavour to learn Finnish (Welsh, by comparison, is a piece of cake!), and after some years, I am capable of holding my own. The greatest reward for my efforts is that it has opened up the whole Finnish culture and way of living to me, which would otherwise pass me by. I feel more a part of the people, and enjoy myself much more.
I would encourage non-Welsh inhabitants of Wales, no matter what their nationality, to study and master Welsh, as they can only expect a richer, more fulfilling future if they do so.
Stephen ap Hugh,
Finland

Eurostar 'gains passenger share'
Eurostar has managed to poach more passengers away from airlines
More people are using trains on Eurostar routes instead of planes, the cross-Channel operator has claimed.
Eurostar claimed 71% of the air and rail market between London and Paris in August and 64% of the London to Brussels sector.
Passenger numbers on the routes between London, Ashford in Kent, Paris and Brussels grew by 4.3% to 5,630,000 in the first nine months of 2005.
The company said sales benefited from improved levels of punctuality.
Bomb attacks
Eurostar, which began operating in 1994, said punctuality had risen to 87% in the period between January and September.
Director of communications Paul Charles said: "Our market share has risen to record levels on the most competitive routes in Europe."
The rise was also helped by an increase in business travellers which made up for the fall in overseas leisure travellers, who were put off visiting London after the 7 July bomb attacks on the capital.
In 2007, Eurostar will be switching its operation from Waterloo International to St Pancras.
Journey times from London to Paris will be cut to two hours and 15 minutes.

'Guarantee' fire-hit Afan Lido to be replaced
Colourful past of Afan Lido - from the miners' strike to McFly
A pledge has been given that a leisure complex badly damaged in a fire will either be replaced or rebuilt.More than 100 firefighters tackled the blaze at the Afan Lido in Aberafan, which broke out on Wednesday evening. An emergency meeting is being held to discuss its future, although it is still too dangerous for investigators and structural engineers to go inside. But Neath Port Talbot council said there would be an Afan Lido-style complex on the seafront in the future. A lifeguard has told how she saw the fire break out from underneath a fake rock feature and raised the alarm.

Afan Lido leisure centre users speak of their sadness at the fire It led to homes nearby being evacuated and roads closed after it started at 1650 GMT on Wednesday. South Wales Police said a joint investigation with the fire service would begin when the building is safe enough. Ch Insp Andy Kingdom, who was the police commander at the scene, said it was lucky no-one was hurt, and praised lido staff and the emergency services. Several people needed help as properties were evacuated, and Ch Insp Kingdom thanked residents "for their patience and co-operation". "I appreciate many people were inconvenienced but I am sure they will understand that all the measures put in place were absolutely necessary during such a serious incident," he added. Richard Fry from the fire service said: "There's severe damage to the swimming pool area, much of the ceiling has collapsed into that area. "Although from outside it looks fairly small as you can see there's areas of fire damage to the windows. The damage is to the roof area."

Councillor Mike James, cabinet member with responsibility for leisure and tourism at Neath Port Talbot, who is also chair of the Celtic Leisure Trust body in charge of the lido, described the building as an "icon" which dominated the Aberafan seafront and pledged that it would either be rebuilt or replaced. "That's a guarantee from Neath Port Talbot [council]. The future of the Aberafan seafront with an Afan Lido-style complex there in the future," he said. Neath Port Talbot council will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the fire, which is not being treated as suspicious. It has already promised to repair or replace the complex, which was opened by the Queen in 1965 with Graham Jenkins, the brother of Hollywood star Richard Burton, as its first manager. Meanwhile, Tywyn Primary School in adjacent Channel View was closed on Thursday following the fire but is expected to re-open on Friday.
I spotted the fire in the poolside. There is a feature temple and fake rocks and the smoke was coming from inside the rocks
Lifeguard Justine Jones
Fire crews were unable to enter the the leisure centre in the Sandfields estate once the flames broke through the roof. At the height of the blaze, 17 fire vehicles were deployed, including three aerial appliances. Lido lifeguard Justine Jones, 19, was one of four staff on duty at the poolside and was the person who raised the alarm. She told the BBC News website: "I spotted the fire in the poolside. There is a feature temple and fake rocks and the smoke was coming from inside the rocks. "I heard a 'pop' and there was smoke and flames everywhere. It was coming from the bottom by the slides."
The council has already pledged to replace the lido if necessary
Ms Jones, who has worked at the lido for two-and-a-half years, said there was only one person swimming at the time but it took them a moment to attract his attention. "We whistled at him and said, 'there's a fire, quick, run!'" They checked the changing area before leaving. She added: "All the staff got their heads together and acted fast." Ms Jones said the building had fortunately been very quiet at the time the fire started. Her car keys and personal belongings are still inside the building, and she had to leave her car parked outside.

Councillor Ali Thomas, leader of Neath Port Talbot council, paid tribute to the lido's staff for their "prompt, well rehearsed actions which meant that there were no injuries". "I would also like to thank the local residents for their calmness and co-operation with our officers and emergency services during the incident," he said. "Local businesses also showed great citizenship, in particular the Apollo Cinema, who provided teas, coffee and hot dogs free of charge to the emergency services." Aberavon MP Hywel Francis has also visited the lido to thank its staff and the emergency services. He said he would work with the council to make sure the facilities are replaced. We asked for your comments about the fire and memories of the lido. Here are a selection of those received. Thank you for the responses. The comments on this story are now closed.Very saddening to see the lido go up in flames. Many great memories of that places; swimming and playing football. Focal point of Aberafan and Sandfields which will hopefully be resurrected and improved..Mark Norman, Portsmouth, HampshireIt was very sad to witness the Afan Lido being destroyed by fire, luckily there were no injuries. The Lido has delivered an important service to Port Talbot and the surrounding areas over many years, helping to develop international sportsmen/women over a wide variety of activities, it is also the focal point for a range of clubs, giving adults and children quality leisure time ! I really hope the Welsh Assembly treat the Lido as a "special case" and put funding in place for the repairs/rebuild to be carried out ASAP. Peter Bamsey, Port TalbotI worked on the design and building of the original Lido as a young engineer in the sixties. This is the second major fire at the Lido. Lets hope they build a state of the art complex for the residents of NPTCC. What will the school children do now for their swimming lessons?Peter Lindsay,First the Aberavon Beach Hotel, then the social club (Dunes) followed by the Vivian Hotel and now the Lido all within close proximity of each other. What Next??????B. Pughsley, Baglan, Port TalbotI can not believe this happened. I know of a well known radio station AFAN FM also shares the same building. Not only is the Lido as we know it has changed for life, whats going to happen with one of the best local radio stations ever!Mike foxting, aberavonSaw Coldplay perform here in 2002. I hope they get it rebuilt quickly.Matt, South WalesI work in this area and sometimes sit there to gather my thoughts at Lunch time. Im quite distraught at the thought of this great building not being in my life anymore. Lido, I will miss you greatly. Paul White, BaglanI worked at Neath Baths as a Lifeguard from 1974 - 1977 and swam for the club. I loved visiting the Lido for races, the Pool was 50 metres compared to our 33 and they had a 10 metre diving board - happy memories indeed so sad to see it on fireSteve Davies, Neath & Port TalbotIt was so upsetting to see history going up in smoke. But even worse to see my daughter really upset as she has been going to the Lido for the last three years to her swimming club. She was so upset that she asked me to put a comment on for her, which I did last night. she is only six and it has really upset her. Hopefully another complex will be built so that she can continue to enjoy her swimming and keep children of Port Talbot Fit and Healthy! Catherine Tossell, Port Talbotwhile i don't live local to the lido, my brother lives a stones throw away from it. we've taken my children to the pool many times, its one of the best in the area for younger children i found. i hope they rebuild the pool area in a similar design, we liked the weather warnings to let us know the wave machine was being turned on!Peter Carnegie, cwmbran, gwentFirst the gwyn hall now the lido gone up in flames NPTCBC need to look at spending money on fire sprinkler systems to try to avoid this happening ever againchristopher davies, NeathA sad sad thing.I remember being at St.Johns School in Porthcawl and going swimming every monday evening at the Lido ......... our only break from the school being a border there , will be sadly missed if it is totally gutted.Greg Donald, Swansea
A large hole could be seen at the Afan Lido after the fire
had many a happy day out there as a child and it will be sadly miised, guess it's to early to asertain if we'll get something of equal character back in the area Danny Roberts, port talbotI cannot believe that a main attractiong in Port Talbot has been ruined... It brought back so many memories as a child... I just hope it will be back to its usual self soon... I would just like to say Well Done to the emergancy services who acted very quickly and a great response! Liam Powell, BridgendThis building meant a lot to me, too - particularly the theatre where my father used to act. I didn't realise it was 56 years old; maybe it's time for the town to get a new icon, properly promoted this time. Sadly I would bet that - as with many such projects these days - the new Lido will have less facilities than before, not more.Huw B, LondonI can not belive the afan lido has gone up in flames yesterday and the tanks blew up and my car is out side the boiler room i can not belive it. jackson, port talbot3 friends and I were due to see the Lost[rophets and Kids In Glass Houses on St. Davids day next year.. They are only doing small gigs and this would have been perfect, it is too early to know what will happen. I am completely stunned and was very much looking forward to it.Nick Bolton, CardiganI was in the gym that over looks the pool at the time of the alarm, all we heard was a loud pop and the alarm activiated. The staff of the Aqua dome and afan lido done an excellent job in evacuating the build, swifly and calmly. It a great shame as this was a massive part of my child hood years.David Jones, Neath and port talbotThese things happen for a reason I am sure, I was there in June and remembered being a young teen on the prowl for a new girlfriend, found one too, but can;t remember her name! Bigger and better and more modern facility to come, the Port Talbot area needs this kind of facelift anyway, and something for it's citizens to get behind and forget the gloom of all the job lossesKeith Walters, London, CanadaIt is a great shame as it was one of the places I went to as a child when there was a lot more there in the 60s and 70s. It was one of my enjoyments going for a swim there. I often drive past when visiting the area to see how it has changed - and it certainly has now.J R Jones, Lytham St. Annesits a shame and shock this has happened here in port talbot my son who works on afan fm dj smokey has been told that the radio station has been closed untill further notice this building i have grown up with yet another blow to port talbot vivienne baker, port talbotI just see that this might not be rebuilt unless there is money from the Welsh assembly/goverment because we didn't have enough money to open a 'bowling alley' which is next the Afan lido and now is empty. I think this won't be rebuilt even before next summer unless its sorted out immediatelyRhodri M, Port Talboti can not think where me and my friends will go for football now!ryan mcmurray, port talbotI can't believe one of the main attractions of aberavon beach was up in flames. Drove past the Lido one minuite and it was it usual self - coming home from neath, thick black smoke was spilling from the roof. Such a shame, going to miss it! Jodie Preece, Aberavon seafrontHave just left the Afan Lido and seeing the amount of black smoke coming from the roof, I am so glad nobody has been hurt. Secondly, I applaud the workforce at the Afan Lido, I know them all well and after speaking to a few, one of their concerns was the swimming club and the other clubs and how will this affect everyone. As one of a team of volunteer swimming teachers with Aberavon Swimming Club based in the aquadome, it's a devastation for the community and surounding areas living by the sea, we may once again lose our swimming pool.Peter, Port TalbotStunned by the news.I used to swim at the lido with my father back in the early 1970's.How will the council now repair/resite such an icon of the community?:( Edward wain, Findon,West SussexCan't belive the Lido has gone up in smoke! a tradegy for the community, my children have learnt to swin there, lets hop the council re-build it really quick!Karen Davies, Port TalbotI was only training there yesterday. I was on my way swimming when i found out it was on fire. Where can our swimming squad go now ? rhys williams, neathAbsolutely gutted - was due to watch Lost Prophets and Kids in Glass Houses there in March. Such a shame. What will happen to this gig now???Chantelle, Llanelli

Gallery fights to save rare slave portrait
The portrait is Britain's earliest known example of a freed African slave
A rare painting could be lost to the nation if sufficient funds to secure its future are not found in time, says the National Portrait Gallery.The 18th century portrait of Ayuba Diallo, a freed African slave in Britain, only recently came to light. Last month the gallery launched a public appeal to prevent it from leaving the country. A further £60,000 has yet to be raised before the end of August deadline. The painting, by William Hoare of Bath, has never been seen in public before. It offers a link to some of the otherwise missing black and Islamic histories in its Collection, says the gallery. Diallo, born into a family of Muslim clerics in West Africa, was taken into slavery and sent to work on a plantation in America. He managed to arrive in London in 1733 where he was introduced at Court and bought out of slavery by public subscription. Appeal for supportThe gallery, founded to collect portraits of famous British men and women, contains over 160,000 items from the 16th century to the present day. London was going through a period of enlightenment in the 1700s and the portrait becomes part of this...
Sandy Nairne of the National Portrait Gallery
Asked about the significance of the Diallo portrait, director Sandy Nairne said, "London was going through a period of enlightenment in the 1700s, with Sir Hans Soane founding the British Museum. "So these things were going on and the portrait becomes part of this." In July the gallery launched an appeal for support to acquire Hoare's painting to save it from export. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Gallery director Sandy Nairne talks about the Diallo portrait and appeal
A final sum of £100,000 was required after a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Art Fund. With two weeks left to the end of August deadline, the gallery's latest figures reveal a shortfall of £60,000. Now it is appealing for the public to step in and make a donation through its website. Speaking to BBC London Mr Nairne said, "Technically, the people who've bought it can legitimately export the painting from the country. "We have to hope we can get the extra help we need before the deadline."

More football clubs face collapse says leaked FA paper
The FA says it is working with clubs to ensure football's financial health
A leaked Football Association document seen by the BBC has warned of "dangerously high wage costs in some clubs throughout the leagues".Ian Watmore's report, written before he quit as FA chief executive, was sent to Football and Premier League bosses. A source close to the FA claimed clubs stifled debate about football finances inside the organisation. But FA statement said the governing body works with clubs to ensure the financial health of football. It had previously denied that the professional game has blocked proposals for change. Mr Watmore's leaked internal document, seen by BBC Radio 4's The Report programme, said "a significant number of clubs are said to be on the brink of severe financial troubles as a result". Watmore claimed "clubs are at risk of the charge 'of unsustainably mortgaging their futures' - converting their long-term assets into cash now by taking loans against stadia and other capital assets". The Report has been told by a source close to the highest levels of the FA that any efforts to debate with the Premier League about introducing greater financial scrutiny are blocked by its member clubs and Football League members on the FA's board.
The FA continues to work hard alongside the professional leagues, supporters and all of the game's stakeholders to ensure a regulatory framework exists to support sustainable, competitive and healthy club football
FA statement
"It was made clear that it was something that the professional game would sort out for itself," said the source. "The Premier League did not need the FA interfering with the financial side. It saw its role as the financial governing body of the top end of football." He added if changes had been made five years ago "then the Portsmouth situation may not have happened." Earlier this season, Portsmouth became the first Premier League club to enter administration. On Thursday, it was revealed its debt totalled £138m. The FA has said there is no evidence the professional game had blocked any proposals for change. A statement issued to The Report added: "The FA continues to work hard alongside the professional leagues, supporters and all of the game's stakeholders to ensure a regulatory framework exists to support sustainable, competitive and healthy club football. "We believe this framework must seek the right balance between the risks of financial instability of clubs on the one hand, and the promotion of an economic model that can continue to attract investment in the game on the other."
606: DEBATE
Who in their right mind would ever consider buying Portsmouth? Surely the debt problem will not go away and will impact on the club's finances over the next few years

The Premier League points to new measures due to come into effect next season which it said will tighten financial criteria surrounding clubs. It added that the rules will give the Premier League Board greater powers of scrutiny and intervention. And the league also said that further regulation is being brought forward by its board for member clubs to vote on in their upcoming Annual General Meeting. Creditors of Portsmouth FC were meeting on Thursday to approve a debt-repayment plan. The Report is on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday, 6 May at 2000 BST. You can also listen via the BBC
