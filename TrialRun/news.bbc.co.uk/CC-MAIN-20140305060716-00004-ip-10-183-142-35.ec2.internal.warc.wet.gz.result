Washington 'snubbed Iran offer'
Iran gives millions of dollars to support the Hezbollah movement
Iran offered the US a package of concessions in 2003, but it was rejected, a senior former US official has told the BBC's Newsnight programme.
Tehran proposed ending support for Lebanese and Palestinian militant groups and helping to stabilise Iraq following the US-led invasion.
Offers, including making its nuclear programme more transparent, were conditional on the US ending hostility.
But Vice-President Dick Cheney's office rejected the plan, the official said.
The offers came in a letter, seen by Newsnight, which was unsigned but which the US state department apparently believed to have been approved by the highest authorities.
In return for its concessions, Tehran asked Washington to end its hostility, to end sanctions, and to disband the Iranian rebel group the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq and repatriate its members. But as soon as it got to the White House, the old mantra of 'We don't talk to evil'... reasserted itself
Lawrence Wilkerson
Former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had allowed the rebel group to base itself in Iraq, putting it under US power after the invasion. One of the then Secretary of State Colin Powell's top aides told the BBC the state department was keen on the plan - but was over-ruled.
"We thought it was a very propitious moment to do that," Lawrence Wilkerson told Newsnight. "But as soon as it got to the White House, and as soon as it got to the Vice-President's office, the old mantra of 'We don't talk to evil'... reasserted itself."
Observers say the Iranian offer as outlined nearly four years ago corresponds pretty closely to what Washington is demanding from Tehran now. Since that time, Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah inflicted significant military losses on the major US ally in the region, Israel, in the 2006 conflict and is now claiming increased political power in Lebanon. Palestinian militant group Hamas won power in parliamentary elections a year ago, opening a new chapter of conflict in Gaza and the West Bank. The UN Security Council has imposed sanctions on Iran following its refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment programme. Iran denies US accusations that its nuclear programme is designed to produce weapons.

IBM, Intel beat expectations
Intel saw strong demand in the first quarter
The world's largest semi conductor maker Intel saw its profits jump nearly 40% in the first quarter of this year.
Its strong earnings reinforces analyst perception of the company as one of the safest bets in the technology sector.
Earnings were also strong at computer maker IBM but it saw its revenues hit by poor sales of desktop computers and mainframes.
The company still expects this year to be a good one and blames the poor sales on the drop in computer spending in the wake of the millennium changeover.
IBM slowdown
"This was a transitional quarter, as we expected, with Y2K lockdowns continuing until late in the quarter," chairman and chief executive Louis Gerstner said in a statement.
IBM revenues fell 5% to $19.3bn, disappointing analysts who had expected customers to have recovered by now from the preparation work they did for the millennium bug.
IBM's Gerstner says 2000 will be a good year
Personal computer sales were also hurt by IBM's decision to stop selling its Aptiva machines in retail stores.
The company's share price is likely to be hit by the news when the market reopens on Wednesday.
Shares in IBM, which closed at $115, slipped to $112 in after hours trading in New York.
But the company's earnings did beat market expectations.
Its profit rose 3% to $1.52bn, compared with $1.47bn a year ago. Earnings per share were 83 cents, compared with Wall Street expectations of 78 cents.
Intel boom
Intel now looks set to build on its popularity with investors.
Many analysts are already positive about the semi conductor sector, seeing it as the safest bet in the technology market.
Earlier on Tuesday, the stock had rallied when Morgan Stanley said analyst Mark Edelston upgraded his
rating on Intel to strong buy from outperform.
Intel's profit jumped 37% to $2.7bn, from $2bn in the same period last year.
Its earnings were 71 cents per share, compared with expectations of 69 cents per share.
Stronger than expected computer sales also boosted its revenues to $8bn from $7.1bn last year, the company said.
Traditionally, the post Christmas period sees sluggish sales.
"Seasonally this is usually a weak quarter for them, and it came in stronger than expectations'' a Salomon Smith Barney analyst said.

Titanic still People's Choice
Another prize: Director James Cameron with actress Suzy Amis
Movie blockbuster Titanic was a hit at a major US awards ceremony on Sunday night - but director James Cameron has had enough of winning prizes.
The film won 11 Oscars last year, and sailed home with two People's Choice Awards, which are voted for by the public through a nation-wide telephone poll.
Celine Dion: Favourite female musical performerIt won favourite motion picture, beating Steven Spielberg's wartime epic Saving Private Ryan, and space action film Armageddon. It also won favourite dramatic motion picture, while singer Celine Dion - whose theme from the film, My Heart Will Go On, was a massive world-wide hit - was named favourite female musical performer.
But James Cameron said: "We're hoping this is closure. It really is a great honour. After 1998 being such a fantasy year for all of us, this is a nice way to end it."
Saving Private Ryan star Tom Hanks - who won favourite movie actor - joked: "It's never too late to give an award to Titanic."
But the film's stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet lost out to Hanks and Sandra Bullock as favourite actor and actress.
Sir Elton John, who performed on stage with country singer LeAnn Rimes, was named all-time favourite musical performer.
Helen Hunt: Still loves winningHarrison Ford was the all-time favourite movie star, while Bill Cosby won the television equivalent and country singer Garth Brooks won his 10th People's Choice award as favourite male musical performer.
Seinfeld and Frasier shared best television comedy, and ER won best television drama. Favourite male television performer was Tim Allen, from the sitcom Home Improvement.
Helen Hunt - who won a best actress Oscar for As Good As It Gets last year - picked up favourite female television performer for her role in Mad About You.
Asked by reporters if she was tired of award ceremonies, she replied: "When you win, it's hard to get sick of it. It's very flattering."
There's Something About Mary was named best comedy movie.
This year's awards - the 25th - were the first to feature online voting via the Internet.

BBC News | ENTERTAINMENT | Myers sues over studio 'bullying'

Myers sues over studio 'bullying'
Myers claims he was chased by studio representative
Austin Powers star Mike Myers is suing Universal Pictures for $20m (�13m), claiming it tried to bully him into making a film.
Myers alleges he was "chased down dark, winding and unlit streets" by a representative of the studio.
The move comes weeks after Universal launched its own action against the actor, which it said had broken a commitment to star in the film, called Dieter, for which he was to be paid $20m.
But Myers insists he only pulled out because he was not happy with the script he had written.
Myers was a huge hit in his role as Austin Powers
Dieter is based on a German talk show character created by the Canadian comic on Saturday Night Live.
He says he needed more time to fix the script, which was "fundamentally flawed" and could not meet the studio's deadline.
Last week, producer Brian Grazer's Imagine Entertainment company filed yet another lawsuit, this time for $30m (19.8m), suggesting Myers accepted $500,000 (�330,000) of his fee in exchange for a promise to work on the movie.
'Greed'
Myers' counter-suit, filed at Los Angeles Superior Court by his lawyer, describes the case as "a classic example of a movie studio... placing greed above artistic integrity".
He claims Grazer and Universal executive Stacy Snider told him the script was "good enough" and they could all make "huge amounts of money" out of it.
In an earlier statement issued by his publicist, he said: "I cannot in good conscience accept $20m and cheat movie-goers who pay their hard-earned money to see my work by making a movie with an unacceptable script."
Myers also filed claims for assault, abuse of process and invasion of privacy, saying a Universal representative "stalked" him.
He alleged the representative chased him "in a threatening manner down dark, winding and unlit streets". A Universal spokesman said: "We fully expected a cross-claim and it has no merit."

Israel to uproot 20 illegal settlements
Ben Eliezer has backed settlements in the past
Israel's defence minister has said he wants to uproot 20 illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
Binyamin Ben Eliezer has not identified which settlements will be targeted.
I am definitely at a point where I am going to deal with the issue of the illegal outposts
Binyamin Ben Eliezer
About 200 Jewish settlements have been set up with Defence Ministry permission on the West Bank and Gaza Strip since Israel seized the territories in 1967.
But about 60 so-called "rogue" outposts, often just a cluster of caravans, have also appeared in recent years.
All the settlements, which are often occupied by religious nationalists, are a major bone of contention between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Dovish Israelis ask whether the settlements are worth defending
Palestinians have targeted settlers and settlements in
their 20-month-old uprising, which erupted in September
2000 after peace talks collapsed. And some Israelis question now whether the enclaves are worth defending. Many view the settlers as an extremist minority. To many secular, dovish Israelis, settler ideology precludes the possibility of reaching a peace agreement with the Palestinians.
Settler anger
Mr Ben Eliezer has supported the settlements in the past, but has always said he is ready to make concessions when the time is right.
He told Israeli radio: "I am definitely at a point where I am going to deal with the issue of the illegal outposts.
Settlements have been the target of growing Palestinian attacks
"I hope that in the near future I will be able to go where necessary and clear away whoever and whatever needs to be removed."
The Settlers' Council, which represents Jewish settlements, called on Mr Ben Eliezer to recognise the latest settlements as a "suitable response" to Palestinian attacks.
Eldad Bishari, a settler who moved a few months ago to
Hill 782 - an outpost just above the West Bank settlement
of Itamar, said: "We cannot give in, we cannot
compromise, we cannot allow terrorism to achieve some of
its goals."
But Mossi Raz, of the left-wing Meretz party and the former head of the Peace Now movement, said Mr Ben Eliezer had not gone far enough.
He said: "Outposts are built against the law and the army sends soldiers to endanger their lives in order to protect those same people who are breaking the law."

Murder case on hold over DNA test
The body of James Gilchrist was found in the River Foyle
The trial of four men for the murder of a Londonderry musician has been adjourned because low copy number DNA formed part of the prosecution case. Jim Gilchrist was killed on his way home from a bar in September 2005. His body was later recovered from the River Foyle. Prosecution lawyers told Londonderry Crown Court that DNA formed part of its case against Daryl Quigley. The case has been adjourned to Laganside in Belfast on 4 February.
Doubts about the use of low copy number DNA have been raised after the acquittal of Omagh bomb accused Sean Hoey last month.

Worth every penny
By Rob Bonnet
BBC Sport
Nice try Arsene! Ten million pounds too expensive? I don't think so!
Maybe the Arsenal manager is justifying his own lack of inclination to seek the signature of England's best central defender? (Campbell and Ferdinand at the heart of the Highbury defence - imagine that!).
Or maybe he's right.
But not if the law of the free market place is what counts.
After all, true value is merely the maximum that the highest bidder is prepared to pay for the product at any one time. Fergie's long pursuit
So in Ferdinand's highly celebrated case it is precisely the amount endorsed on the Manchester United cheques by chief executive Peter Kenyon.
(And it's an amount, incidentally, that might just kick-start English football's otherwise moribund transfer market prior to the start of the season.)
Mr Kenyon is neither stupid. Nor reckless. Not even amidst the eerie popping sound of financial bubbles bursting across European football, where for example Italian club Fiorentina have asked their players to agree a salary cut.
And not even over a five year deal costing the United board about �50m in transfer fees and salary. Phil McNulty's view
As long as he stays motivated, fit and a player of skill and intelligence (all probables), then Ferdinand will help take Manchester United back to their previous pre-eminence in English football. Is it fair that United's financial muscle should strangle the market?
Maybe not, but it's up to the Premiership chairmen to vote in another way. Which they can't and won't. Ferdinand will be the backbone that United never had in their slipped-disc of a 2001/2002 season.
It is as sound and sensible an investment as the acquisition of Veron for only �2m fewer was speculative and fanciful. Veron - not good value compared to Ferdinand
And for Fergie it specifically repairs the damage made when he decided to cut off his nose to spite his face and sell Jaap Stam.
But the real point is that Rio Ferdinand is top-to-bottom class. And I don't just mean in the timing of his tackles or his distribution of the ball.
He conducted himself at the World Cup with dignity and poise. And he did much the same at the Old Trafford news conference, where interestingly he was accompanied not by an army of sharp-suited hangers-on but by members of his family. Which says something about his values (and not his value).
Alan Hansen's verdict
Sir Alex described him as potentially the best centre-half in the world. Having paid a world record transfer fee for a defender he could hardly have said otherwise. But Ferdinand's response was simply to say he wanted to continue to improve himself, a process that began as a child when he was living on a south London estate. He is a man of the right stuff. Leeds fans who complain about his lack of loyalty must ask themselves if they registered similar disapproval about his defection from West Ham. Probably not. Club loyalty amongst footballers means no more than it does amongst nurses who change hospitals or teachers who change schools. And nor should it. Only professionalism counts - and Ferdinand has that in abundance.
