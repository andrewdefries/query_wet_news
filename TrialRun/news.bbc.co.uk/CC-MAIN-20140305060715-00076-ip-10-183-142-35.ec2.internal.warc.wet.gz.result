Bush-Sarkozy lunch 'not summit'
Sarkozy is the second world leader invited to Maine by President Bush
US President George W Bush welcomed his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, to his family home in Maine on Saturday for an informal lunch and boat ride.
Officials stressed the meeting was not a summit but instead a chance for the two men to get to know each other over hot dogs and hamburgers.
France's former President Jacques Chirac's opposition to the Iraq war saw Franco-US relations fall to a new low.
But Mr Sarkozy has made it clear that he will adopt a more pro-US stance.
Mr Bush praised Mr Sarkozy as he waited with his wife and parents on the lawn of the family home in Kennebunkport, on the Atlantic seaside.
"The good thing about President Sarkozy is you know where he stands," Mr Bush told reporters.
Maine lunch renews ties
Before the lunch, Mr Sarkozy, who is on holiday in America, said he admired the US as "a great democracy, a country of freedom".
He called the US a "close friend", comparing France's relations with it to a family which sometimes had disagreements. "Do we agree on everything? No.
"Even within the family there are disagreements but we are still of the same family and we may be friends and not agree on everything but we are friends nevertheless. That's the truth."
Despite protestations that the meeting was just a casual lunch, some observers remarked that it was impossible to imagine Mr Bush issuing a similar invitation to Mr Chirac.
In addition to the Iraq war, disagreements over trade and climate change further strained the relationship between Mr Bush and Mr Chirac.
In contrast, Mr Sarkozy made it clear from the outset of his presidency that America could count on his friendship.
US officials have pointed out that the countries are already working closely on issues such as Iran, Lebanon and Sudan.
Hot dogs and hamburgers
The lunch included hot dogs and hamburgers, as well as corn-on-the-cob, baked beans, and fresh blueberry pie.
No mention was made of whether french fries were on the menu. Some Americans started calling chipped potatoes "freedom fries" after Mr Chirac opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
The French president's wife, Cecilia Sarkozy, was meant to be at the lunch but phoned First Lady Laura Bush to say she and her children were feeling unwell and would not attend.
After lunch, President Bush and his father, former President George Bush, took Mr Sarkozy for a 30-minute boat ride.
The Sarkozys have been on holiday in nearby New Hampshire, although Mr Sarkozy briefly returned to France for the funeral on Friday of Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger.
Mr Sarkozy's decision to take a holiday in the US has led to some negative comments at home, especially from critics who believe he would like to see the French economy overhauled to follow the American free market model. Only one other foreign leader has been invited by President Bush to his family's home in Maine. Russian President Vladimir Putin went there in July for an informal meeting that was dubbed the "lobster summit".

Rachel Stevens splits with fiance
Rachel Stevens first shot to fame with teen band S Club 7
Former S Club singer Rachel Stevens has split with her fiance Jeremy Edwards.
The couple have ended their three-year relationship because "sometimes things just don't work out", a statement from her management company said.
Stevens, 25, and former Holby City and Hollyoaks actor Edwards, 32, said they remained "great friends" despite both being "very sad" about the split.
A spokeswoman for 19 Entertainment denied Stevens' recent success as a solo artist was behind the break-up.
We know that our decision is the right one
Rachel Stevens and Jeremy Edwards
She said the couple had tried to "work it out" and that the break-up had been amicable.
In a joint statement, the pair said: "Sometimes things just don't work out no matter how hard you try.
"We still care for each other and are great friends and although it is very sad, we know that our decision is the right one."
Solo career
Back in August, the couple issued a statement asking the press for breathing space because they were going through a rocky patch.
Jeremy Edwards quit Holby City to develop his career
Stevens launched a solo career with pop mogul Simon Fuller after S Club split up last April.
Her debut single Sweet Dreams My LA Ex was a number two hit.
The former model, who began her pop career with S Club in 1999, is a favourite of the tabloid press and was voted the sexiest woman in Britain by a men's magazine. Edwards made his name in BBC One hospital drama Holby City, but quit last year to develop his career. E-mail this to a friend

Chemical find in Royal loch fish
Researchers studied fish on the Royal estate
Fish on the Queen's Balmoral Estate are polluted with higher than usual levels of chemicals, according to research.
A study of brown trout in Lochnagar found levels 10 times higher than in other northern European mountain lakes, conservation body WWF Scotland said.
Researchers from Spain and Norway, who examined four fish from the loch, were studying airborne movement of polybromodiphenyl, or PBDEs.
The flame-retardant chemicals are the by-product of high-tech industries.
Levels of chemicals found in the fish are not known to be hazardous.
WWF Scotland spokesman Richard Dixon said the pollution was able to travel thousands of miles due to prevailing winds.
Food chain
He said: "It is shocking that even remote parts of Scotland are contaminated with these chemicals.
"It is even worse when they turn up at one of our most famous locations, so closely associated with the Royal Family."
Dr Dixon added: "Once in the lake water they would have entered the food chain, eventually reaching the trout and anyone who has been eating them."
Experts examined lakes in Norway, the French Pyrenees, Austria, Slovakia, north west Bulgaria and Greenland - as well as Lochnagar.
The mountain, Lochnagar, which is near the loch of the same name, was made famous as the setting of Prince Charles' story, The Old Man of Lochnagar - which has since been dramatised for the stage and screen.
A spokesman for the Balmoral estate said he did not know how relevant the survey was or how harmful the chemicals were.
However, he presumed it was a worldwide problem.

Girl fights ban on playing outdoors
Watch Francesca's report
Press Packer Francesca was annoyed when she was stopped from playing games outside with her friends.So she spoke to the council to get it sorted out. Here's her story."I used to play cricket and football outside with my friends. Then some of our neighbours wrote a letter saying we weren't allowed to play outside any more. They blamed us for things getting broken, and said it was dangerous. When my dad showed me the letter I was really angry, because I knew they couldn't just stop us playing outside. Kids are always told we need to be healthier, but now we're stuck inside watching telly, and increasing the electricity bill. Ban was liftedIn the end the neighbours said we could play outside, so long as we didn't play any ball games. If I want to play football I have to go to the park. But lots of my friends aren't allowed to play in the park without adult supervision. I've looked on the internet for things to do, but everything is either really expensive or really far away, and difficult for me to get to. When I spoke to the council about it, they said they try and plan activities where they know lots of young people hang about. There are things going on that I'd like to do, I've just got to find a way to get to them."
