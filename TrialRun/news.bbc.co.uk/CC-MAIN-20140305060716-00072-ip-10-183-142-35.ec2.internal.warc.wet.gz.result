Money men still wooing tech firms
By Myles Neligan
BBC News Online business reporter
The love affair that blossomed between technology entrepreneurs and international money men during the late 1990s has hit a decidedly rocky patch.
We've seen venture capital investment completely dry up in the last two years
Phillip Alvelda, Idetic Venture capital firms, heavily exposed to the tech sector recession, have abruptly pulled the plug on many small internet and telecoms companies.
The cash crunch has forced thousands of fledgling tech firms out of business, turning California's Silicon Valley - the epicentre of the last decade's economic boom - into an unemployment black spot.
But despite this setback, the relationship between venture capitalists (VCs) and tech entrepreneurs is not over - rather, it has been comprehensively redefined to suit these leaner times.
Focus
At this week's Cal-IT conference - an annual non-commercial event in London where California-based tech firms mingle with European VCs - a new mood of realism had replaced the devil-may-care optimism of a few years ago.
Mobile data delivery is driving tech sector growth
"Back then, if someone wanted to sell pet food online, they'd get funded," said Yuan Huntington, vice-president of Talkway Communications, one of the exhibitors.
"But now, the companies that get funding are those with real business plans."
In fact, relatively few of the firms touting their wares at Cal-IT 2002 are looking for a simple cash injection.
Most have got beyond the early start-up stage, and are hoping to clinch long-term partnership deals with the venture capital divisions of major European tech and telecoms players.
And the fuzzy "gee, why didn't I think of that" business models that gave the dot.com boom a bad name are entirely absent.
We're looking for technology that's already proven in the marketplace
Felix Wunderer, BV Capital
Most of the firms at the event make highly focused products aimed squarely at high-growth technology markets.
Talkway, for example, has developed technology which allows e-mail users to view video messages without any supporting software, a product which fits in well with the growing trend for multi-media messaging.
The company aims to introduce the new technology to the European mass market solely through marketing deals with established telecoms firms.
No timewasters
This new, hard-headed approach is mirrored on the investment side, where the money men have reined in the legendary profligacy which not so long ago turned many no-hope dot.coms - however briefly - into multi-million dollar corporations.
Nowadays, only start-ups with promising technologies and high growth potential need apply.
"We're looking for technology that's already proven in the marketplace," said Dr Felix Wunderer of BV Capital, a venture capital firm backed by media giants Bertelsmann and AOL Time Warner.
"Also, we would aim to sell our stake within three to five years, so the company should be able to scale up within that period."
According to Mr Wunderer, investors' recent disenchantment with the tech sector has been overdone, burying some exciting new developments under a tidal wave of negative hype.
"The interesting areas now are (technologies) which enable corporations to make their processes more efficient, or which help them to interact better with their customers," he says.
Not First Tuesday
Spokespeople for Cal-IT are keen to distinguish it from First Tuesday, the iconic dot.com-era networking forum for VCs and entrepreneurs.
VC cash: Still there for the right firms
They point out that the firms which attend have been pre-selected by a panel of seasoned VCs, in contrast with First Tuesday's cheerful free-for-all.
And most of the tech hopefuls at the event have already held talks with potential backers, paving the way for deals to be signed in a row of small meeting rooms on the floor above the main conference hall.
The California Technology, Trade and Commerce Agency (CTTCA)- the state export promotions body which organises the event - says it has generated partnership deals and investment agreements worth about $500m since it started in 1996.
According to Jeffrey Gersick, the CTTCA's chief European representative, Cal-IT's emphasis on matching entrepreneurs with the right financial backers helped to make it a success even during the dark days immediately after the 11 September attacks.
"This event last year came five weeks after (the attacks), when the tech sector was already having a difficult time," he said.
We were cashflow positive last year largely as a result of exposure (at Cal-IT)
Phillip Alvelda, Idetic "But we broke the previous record for the number of meetings (between companies and VCs)."
Lifeline
The event has certainly proved a life-saver for some struggling Californian tech firms.
Idetic, a Berkeley-based company specialising in mobile data delivery software, started up at the tail-end of the tech boom in 1999, and was still looking for that vital breakthrough when it attended Cal-IT last year.
Its appearance at the event paid off, leading to a partnership deal with German electronics giant Siemens which gave it access to key markets in Europe and Asia.
"We were cashflow positive last year largely as a result of that exposure," said Idetic chief executive Phillip Alvelda. His relief is evident.
"From a small company perspective, the situation (in California) really is disastrous. "We've seen venture capital investment completely dry up in the last two years"
"But to quote Winston Churchill, when you're going through hell, keep going."

Schroeder's 'hair-dye case' in court
Gerhard Schroeder does not see the funny side A German court is considering a libel action brought by Germany's Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder against a news agency which reported that he dyes his hair. Friday's hearing lasted 10 minutes, and the Hamburg court said it would deliver its judgment on 17 May.
Earlier this year the DDP agency quoted a woman image consultant suggesting teasingly that Gerhard Schroeder, aged 58, should admit that he dyed his hair to keep it looking dark. Someone who touches up his hair also touches up statistics
Karl Josef Laumann, Christian Social Union
It would be better, she suggested, for his "credibility".
Mr Schroeder won a court injunction to stop DDP carrying further reports about his hair, but it ignored the ruling.
Lawyers for the 58-year-old chancellor said that since the injunction had been broken, "we are obliged to sue".
Mr Schroeder's hairdresser says the chancellor has "some grey hairs"
Mr Schroeder's conservative political rivals have made much of the row, one claiming that "someone who touches up his hair also touches up statistics".
DDP says it could not accept the court injunction, because it would have become the only German media outlet unable to report on the matter.
Its editor-in-chief, Bernd von Jutrcenzka, has argued that the injunction was unnecessary because the agency published a retraction.
He has also pointed out that the chancellor took no action against the image consultant, Sabine Schwind von Egelstein.
'Very natural'
I would know if Gerhard Schroeder was colouring his hair
Mr Schroeder's hairdresser Udo Walz In his fashionable hair salon in Berlin's Uhlandstrasse, Mr Schroeder's regular hairdresser Udo Walz is definite that his famous client is telling the whole truth. "I would know if Gerhard Schroeder was colouring his hair," he says. He insists the chancellor's hair is "very natural. He looks great." Udo Walz is even more specific. "If you go close, like I do, you can see that he has some grey hairs" underneath the thick mat of dark brown locks. But Udo insists the grey hairs just stay there, and are hard to see. His written testimony to the court, along with that of Mr Schroeder's former hairdresser in Hanover, was submitted to the court by Mr Schroeder's lawyers.
Mr Schroeder has a reputation for being more laid-back than most of his compatriot politicians. But many media reports in Germany imply that on this issue his sense of humour has taken a holiday. A court ruling is expected soon, at the latest within three weeks.

Afghan 'Indiana Jones' hunts lost Bamiyan statue
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Lyse Doucet meets the man on the trail of the legendary lost Buddha
Lyse Doucet
BBC Newsnight, Bamiyan
Dr Zemaryalai Tarzi is an Afghan with a big dream. To be exact, this archaeologist dreams of a giant - a 1,000ft (300 metre) sleeping Buddha.Try to imagine a stone statue reclining across the length of three football fields. A Buddhist civilisation once flourished in Afghanistan's central highlands
But it is more than a dream. Dr Tarzi is trying to make it a reality. "At first, people told me I must be mad," he recounted, barely concealing a smile, as we stood at his excavation in the midst of potato fields in the ancient Afghan city of Bamiyan. "An archaeologist needs proof. We need to keep searching." Dr Tarzi, who has been mapping the landscape of Bamiyan for 40 years, is renowned world-wide for his knowledge of the Buddhist civilisation that flourished centuries ago in the central highlands of Afghanistan. Bamiyan was a storied destination for travellers journeying on the Silk Road between East and West. Ancient textIn the 7th Century, a Chinese pilgrim, Xuan Zang, marvelled at a colossal reclining statue: "To the east of the city there is a monastery in which there is a figure of Buddha lying in a sleeping position, as when he attained nirvana. The figure is in length about 1,000 feet." The Taliban destroyed the giant statues leaving just a hole where they stood
His detailed journal piqued Dr Tarzi's curiosity. It read like tantalising proof because Xuan Zang also wrote with passion, and precision, of two magnificent stone Buddhas which stood guard over the valley. The Taliban smashed those statues, the world's largest standing Buddhas, in 2001, denouncing them as un-Islamic idols. That gave further fuel to Dr Tarzi's drive to find the third Buddha. It was an archaeologist's revenge. "A country's history cannot be destroyed," he fumed. I first visited Dr Tarzi in 2005, during the summer months he spends at the dig. It was hard not to find myself willing him to succeed. He confessed, his voice breaking, he still could not bear to look at the gaping niches in the stone cliffs towering over the place where he was working. Stunning findsHe is still there, looking for all the world like an Afghan Indiana Jones of the epic films, with his chino apparel, floppy hat, and air of scholarly adventure. Dr Tarzi demonstrates the repose of a sleeping Buddha statue
The earthen cavities are hives of activity. Afghan archaeologists trained by Dr Tarzi and French colleagues from Strasbourg University gently tap picks and trowels in the dust and dirt, backed up by a small legion of labourers. His team's diligent search for hidden treasures has yielded a stunning array of stone remnants from the remains of Buddhist monasteries - small feet from statues, chiselled folds of monastic robes, sacred stupas. Then, last November, a cry of excitement rang out across this verdant valley. At last, a sleeping Buddha had surfaced. But it was not the fabled giant. Their persistent digging had uncovered fragments of a reclining figure estimated to be 62 feet (19 metres) long. One hand protruded visibly, without a thumb. The head was destroyed. Bigger prizeIt was still hard for a novice to visualise. Dr Tarzi gave it his best, stretching himself sideways along a flat hard surface, one hand tucked neatly under his head. Indiana Jones could have done no better. I ask whether this smaller statue may be all there is. It is, after all, a wonderful find. Afghans trained by Dr Tarzi work alongside students from Strasbourg
"I will persist," the sprightly 70-year-old declared with a firm shake of his head. He guided us to another area running along the foot of the sandstone cliffs where he believes a much bigger Buddha still lies sleeping. Dr Tarzi does not want this remarkable history to be forgotten. In the middle of the day, when a hot sun blazes in the sky, he teaches a master class for young Afghans training to be tour guides at an eco-tourism centre set up with the help of the Aga Khan Foundation. Bamiyan is one of the few places in Afghanistan now safe enough to dream of tourists too. Playing the role of a would be tourist, I asked enthusiastic students to convince me to visit. "Welcome to Bamiyan, historical place, safe for tourists," was the practised but heartfelt reply of an earnest bespectacled woman. An older male student shouted from the back row, "Bamiyan is exceptional in Afghanistan". All the students nodded in agreement. When darkness descended, Dr Tarzi was honoured at a musical evening attended by a gathering of Bamiyan residents who wish him every success. A trio of musicians sang of destroyed Buddhas that are still very much alive. The legend of a giant still lives in Bamiyan. He has slept through centuries of conquest, a quarter century of war, and the end of Taliban rule. If he ever wakes, it would be a dream come true for Dr Tarzi, and countless other Afghans with their own dreams of a lost past and a brighter better future. Watch Lyse Doucet's film in full on Newsnight on Thursday 10 September 2009 at 10.30pm on BBC Two, then afterward on the BBC iPlayer and Newsnight website.

Mobiles to beat nicotine craving
By Jonathan Amos
BBC News Online science staff, in Salford
Smokers desperate to give up cigarettes could soon resort to a small program on their mobile phone or PDA.
Feel the need? Reach for the mobile
It would throw up a series of flickering dots on the screen, which psychologists say seem to break some of the mental processes that drive the need for another nicotine fix.
The idea has been tested in the lab on a desktop computer in a controlled study on students.
But researcher Dr John May, from Sheffield University, UK, said it was something that could quite possibly find its way on to portable devices in the not too distant future.
Reduced reward
"They would need to have reasonable screen resolutions but you could imagine that instead of having a button to launch a Tetris or snake game, you could have a 'stop your craving' button," he told the British Association's science festival in Salford, Greater Manchester.
The dots create what is termed "visual noise" and interfere with the pleasurable images the mind associates with the object of desire.
"They don't stop the images but they do make them less vivid," he said.
"It seems to break the link between the imagery, the emotion and the reward that you feel."
Dr May and colleagues are investigating the thought processes that build up to that moment when an individual has the sudden urge to reach for a cigarette.
Their work suggests there are many unconscious cues that grow in intensity until the intrusive thought occurs.
Allied treatment
"This grabs your attention and you begin to elaborate by coming up with mental images of what it is you want, what it might look like and where you might find it. "These are pleasurable thoughts, positive thoughts, rewarding thoughts - but if we can break that by blocking the mental images, then we demolish the reward and the motivation to keep thinking about it."
The dots hinder memory tasks the mind must perform to build the pleasurable images.
Dr May said it needed to be shown that the flickering dots display actually led to a reduction in smoking, not just to a reduction in craving.
If that could be established then a dots "game" could form the basis of therapy that would work alongside chemical intervention, including nicotine-replacement patches and future vaccines. E-mail this to a friend

Cash shortage hits �10m arts centre
Fact has been hit by problems almost since it opened
A prestigious �10m purpose-built arts centre has been forced to seek emergency loans to cover repair costs.
Liverpool's Fact (Film, Art and Creative Technology) centre says it needs the money to fix three of its four cinemas which were closed after tiles fell from the ceiling of one of them in April.
The Wood Street centre was billed as one of the city's flagship developments in its successful bid to become European Capital of Culture. One of the cinema screens has since re-opened but the other two are not expected to be in use until the middle of November.
Managers have denied reports that the loans showed the centre, which opened in February, was now experiencing a wider cash crisis.
If you believe in the importance of culture and the arts in regeneration then when problems occur you stand behind the project and support it
Councillor Mike Storey, Leader of Liverpool City Council
The centre has asked for money from Liverpool City Council, North West Development Agency, and Arts Council England.
Managers said it was to help its cash flow while the question of who was liable for the cinema closures was resolved.
Eddie Berg, Fact's executive director, said "When the ceiling failed in screen 3 I was absolutely devastated. "All of our key funders, including Liverpool City Council, have worked together to help us resolve the challenges as quickly and effectively as possible. 'Cultural landscape'
"It's a testament to their commitment and conviction in supporting Fact that the key funders have responded in this way. "Fact is going to be a major part of Liverpool's cultural landscape for a very long time."
Councillor Mike Storey, leader of Liverpool City Council, said "The Fact project itself is outstanding and won national praise as the country's only dedicated centre for film and video technology. "Clearly in the construction of the building something has gone wrong but if you believe in the importance of culture and the arts in regeneration then when problems occur you stand behind the project and support it."

By Martin Gough
BBC Sport at Lord's
Ian Harvey took the man of the match award in Gloucestershire's C&G Trophy final victory then admitted he was unsure whether he would be returning to the club next year.
Harvey was instrumental in Gloucestershire's win
Harvey took two wickets in seven balls and clubbed 61 from 36 deliveries as Gloucs clinched their sixth one-day title since 1999, when the Australia all-rounder joined the side.
But off-field divisions meant his place for this year was in doubt, and the club could still go with another overseas player in 2004.
"If the club wants to go in a different direction, that's fine," said Harvey.
"I have no idea if I'll be back."
Harvey described his success as "just one of those days".
"I wanted to be aggressive - I hadn't spoken about it but that was my plan. I wanted to play as straight as possible and back myself.
"Today it came off and hopefully it will continue for the rest of the season."
I don't think anyone in the dressing room is happy
Worcestershire captain Ben Smith
More Worcs reaction
Gloucestershire's other overseas star, South African Jonty Rhodes, is expected to make an announcement on his future next week.
He was responsible for the run out of Worcestershire's Vikram Solanki, turning the match around after an opening partnership of 64. The 34-year-old retired from international cricket after injury ended his World Cup campaign early.
Worcestershire captain Ben Smith said batting with Rhodes at backward point was like having an extra man in the field.
And his Gloucestershire counterpart Mark Alleyne added: "Jonty caused uncertainty every time the ball came within 10 yards of him. That uncertainty builds pressure.
"When you stick a team in you want early wickets and at one point it wasn't going to plan.
"But the bowlers' lines were good and that made field-setting easy."
Alleyne claimed his side's third Trophy victory since 1999, added to B&H Cup wins in 1999 and 2000 and the National League in 2000, suggested Gloucestershire are the best one-day side ever.
"We've had a consistent record over a five-year period," he added.
"The year we didn't win anything [2002] we made two quarter-finals but the expectation has been raised at the club."

Poulter defeats Casey to win World Match Play title
Poulter becomes only the seventh Englishman to win an American tour event
Ian Poulter secured his first victory on American soil after edging out compatriot Paul Casey 4&2 in the WGC-Accenture Match Play final in Arizona.Poulter made the stronger start and was 4up after 14 holes before Casey reduced the deficit to two at the half-way stage on the 36-hole final. But, after regaining a 4up lead early on in the final 18, Poulter saw the lead reduced to 2up on the 28th hole. A missed Casey putt on the 32nd proved crucial as Poulter held on to win. The victory, which earns Poulter a mammoth $1,400,000 (£907,113), also sees him move up to fifth in the world rankings, while Casey, who collected a cheque for $850,000 (£550,665), slots in one place behind his Ryder Cup team-mate in sixth. It was the second successive defeat in the Match Play final for Casey, who lost to Australian Geoff Ogilvy at Ritz-Carlton club in Arizona last year. "To win this golf tournament is mega for me," a delighted Poulter, clad in an eye-catching all-pink outfit for the final, told BBC Radio 5 live. "I'm so, so, so happy.
606: DEBATE
I'd have to say that I'm very happy for Poulter - he's definitely run the gauntlet
Venice1
"It means number five in the world, it means all the hard work, the hours, the gym work... it makes it all the more pleasing to be able to go out on this bigger stage against the best players in the world and pull a win off in this fashion." Poulter, who is the first Englishman to win the event, added: "It's been a long time coming. It was a good day's golf. I knew I was in great form and I felt calm all day - nerves didn't play any factor at all. "I know Paul's disappointed being runner-up two years in a row." Camilo Villegas cruised to a comfortable 5&4 victory over a lacklustre Sergio Garcia to claim third place. The Colombian had been involved in an early-morning start alongside Casey to resume their tense semi-final play-off which was suspended on Saturday night because of fading light. The pair returned to the 10th hole, which Casey won with a confident par to set up an intriguing all-English finale against Poulter.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The 34-year-old from Hertfordshire had been in excellent form throughout the competition and had trailed for only one hole over the final 50 holes of the tournament. That came after the second hole when Casey sent a 216-yard approach to eight feet at the par-five to sink the putt for an eagle. But Poulter took control from the seventh hole, quickly moving to 2up before doubling that lead at the 14th. However, Casey responded well on the last four holes of the first 18, hitting back to reduce the deficit to 2up at the half-way mark. But a poor start after the interval from Casey saw Poulter take advantage, using his red-hot putter to sink successive birdies to resume his lead at 4up. Casey hit back once again, carding successive birdies on the 27th and 28th holes to set up an intriguing finish. But he missed a golden opportunity to close the gap to 1up when he misdirected an eight-foot putt after Poulter faltered. And his opponent took full advantage with a birdie at the 33rd before clinching the title at the 34th.

US & Canada snub angers F1 teams
Montreal is one of the most popular venues on the F1 calendar
Honda team principal Nick Fry has hit out at the decision to drop Canada from the 2009 Formula One calendar.
F1 will have no race in North America after motorsport's governing body the FIA included Abu Dhabi at the expense of Montreal.
"We are hugely disappointed," said Fry. "It will be a major topic at the next meeting of teams."
Toyota president John Howlett said: "Hopefully in the next four years we can establish a real race in the US."
And BMW team principal Mario Thiessen advocated having a "Canadian race and at least one US one".
The dropping of the United States from the 2008 F1 calendar left Canada vulnerable because the costs of transport to North America are steep for a single race.
That was not considered to be an issue when Canada was the sole North American race through much of the 1990s but it is more of a concern at the moment.
To overcome that, Fry suggested holding two races in the US and one in Canada.
