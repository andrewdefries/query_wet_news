Napster rivals celebrate ruling
Thousands logged onto Napster over the weekend
Napster's commercial rivals have welcomed the ruling by a California court that the online music sharing service must stop trading in copyright material. If you can afford to
have a computer, you can afford to pay $16 for my ... CD
Eminem
The ruling did not explicitly order the highly popular internet site to close down, but record companies see the verdict as a victory. "This decision pretty much writes Napster's epitaph," said Chuck Cooper, a lawyer for the Recording Industry Association of America. "Its days as an instrument of shoplifting are over."
Napster has said that it will appeal against the ruling. "We're fighting for this principle and we believe that the
actions that the users are engaged in is not copyright
infringement," said Napster chief executive Hank Barry.
LiableThe 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals found that Napster "knowingly encourages and assists its users to infringe the record companies' copyrights".
The ruling requires Napster to prevent its users from gaining access to copyrighted content through its list of songs which are available for users to download from one computer to another via the internet. We will find a way to keep this community going
Shawn Fanningfounder of Napster "Napster may be held liable for contributory copyright infringement only to the extent that Napster knows of specific infringing files with copyrighted musical compositions or sound recordings," the court said in a summary. It added that Napster would also be liable if it failed to act to prevent the distribution of copyrighted materials.
Napster fights backIn a press conference after the ruling, Napster's attorney Robert Boies said the decision to close down the service would depend upon the scope of the District Court's modified injunction.
The court of appeals found that the injunction is not only warranted but required
Hilary RosenRIAA
He added it could take days or weeks for the injunction to be modified.
At the same press conference, Shawn Fanning, the founder of Napster, said: "We will find a way to keep this community going. If we work together, we will find a way."
The decision comes amid a copyright infringement case between Napster and the record companies.
The injunction only governs the operation of Napster's service during the court case, but the court's decision will be seen as an indicator of the case's final outcome.
Copyright court case
The Recording Industry Association of America, the trade group representing record labels, argues that Napster illegally connects users bent on giving away copyrighted material without permission.
On Monday after the ruling, Hilary Rosen, president of the RIAA, said, "The court of appeals found that the injunction is not only warranted but required, and it ruled in our favour on every legal issue presented."
Many musicians were pleased with the ruling. "We are delighted that the court has upheld the rights of all artists to protect and control their creative efforts," said the heavy metal band Metallica, who were the first group to demand their songs be removed from Napster. Controversial rapper Eminem is another opponent of Napster. "If I'm putting my heart and all my time into my music,
I expect to get rewarded for that. And if you can afford to
have a computer, you can afford to pay $16 for my ... CD," he has said. But other musicians have backed Napster, welcoming the opportunity to reach new audiences. "I think the day of the lazy artist is over with," said rapper Chuck D.
"I think it's
back to earning the respect of the fans one by one."
Even if Napster is forced to closed, a number of other file-swapping programmes exist, including Napigator and Gnutella.
Although more complicated to use than Napster, they perform the same function of allowing people to exchange music and other files with each other over the internet. Search BBC News Online

Testicular transplant first
The man began to produce sperm cells after surgery
A cancer patient is to become a father after surgeons carried out a testicular transplant operation to restore his fertility.
The man became sterile after having chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, a cancer of the white blood cells.
The results are the first to indicate that the technique might work in humans
Professor John Radford
He began to produce sperm again after undergoing pioneering surgery at the Christie Hospital in Manchester, UK. Now, his wife is expecting a baby.
The procedure involved taking tissue from the patient's testicles before he started chemotherapy and freezing it in liquid nitrogen.
Two years later, with the cancer in remission, Christie experts reimplanted the testicular tissue.
John Radford, Professor of Medical Oncology at the Christie Hospital and University of Manchester, led the research team.
Not conclusive
He said: "The results are encouraging but not conclusive.
"It is not certain that the patient's recovery was caused by the operation.
The surgery took place at the Christie Hospital
"A large number of men become infertile after chemotherapy, but a very small proportion subsequently regain their fertility spontaneously.
"The results are however the first to indicate that the technique, which has already been performed successfully in animals, might work in humans. We are therefore cautiously optimistic." The man was among seven patients to receive similar transplants at the hospital, but the only one whose fertility has been restored.
The procedure would particularly benefit prepubescent boys who cannot bank sperm before treatment, but who have sperm precursor stem cells that could be reimplanted. It would also be useful for men who are too ill to bank sperm before chemotherapy, or who prefer a natural conception.
Clare Brown, executive director of CHILD, the UK National Infertility Support Network, told BBC News Online: "CHILD is delighted for the couple, and this success story gives us all hope
for the future.
"Testicular Cancer is surprisingly common, and particularly traumatic when
is detected, and findings like these which may restore fertility is great!
"CHILD awaits the results of further research with great interest."

'Al-Qaeda video' of 20th hijacker
Nashimi died in a shootout with Saudi security forces in 2004
A video said to be from al-Qaeda shows the man it says was the planned "20th hijacker" for the 9/11 US attacks.
The video, released by a US intelligence organisation, is of Saudi man, Fawaz al-Nashimi, who was killed in a shootout in Saudi Arabia in 2004.
The US has not commented and the video claim cannot be independently verified.
The identity of a 20th hijacker has been the subject of great debate, although there is no concrete evidence one was part of the plans for 9/11.
Three of the four hijacked planes on 9/11 had five al-Qaeda men on board, but the plane that crashed into a Pennsylvania field - UA 93 - had only four.
The CIA had initially suspected jailed al-Qaeda operative Zacarias Moussaoui as the 20th hijacker, but later revised its opinion.
Khobar raid
The latest al-Qaeda video was released by IntelCenter, which is based in Virginia and works on intelligence with the US government.
US intelligence services have so far declined to comment on the authenticity of the 54-minute video or its claims.
In the video, Fawaz al-Nashimi, also known as Turki bin Fuheid al-Muteiry, justifies attacks on the West.
Flight UA 93 crashed into a Pennsylvania field
The video also includes audio material said to be of an al-Qaeda attack he took part in on oil facilities in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, in 2004.
Militants took up to 60 hostages in the attack. Saudi forces stormed the complex and 22 people, mostly foreigners, were killed.
Nashimi escaped but was killed in a shootout with security forces the following month.
A statement said to be from al-Qaeda had appeared on a website on 13 June identifying Nashimi as the planned 20th hijacker.
It said that "for some reasons" alleged ringleader Mohammed Atta brought forward the date of the attacks and it was "not in Allah's design for [Nashimi] to become a martyr along with his 19 brothers".
The posting denied Moussaoui was the 20th hijacker, backing up an audio recording released in May purported to be from al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden.
The man in the tape says: "I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission."
The 9/11 Commission, which investigated the attacks, suggested a number of al-Qaeda members may have tried to enter the US, possibly to take part in them.
They included Mohammed al-Kahtani, who was refused entry at Orlando airport in Florida in August 2001.
Other names that have been suggested include Mushabib al-Hamlan and Ramzi Binalshibh, who was repeatedly denied entry to the US.

Emotional scenes on the Indian border
By Asit Jolly
BBC correspondent at the Wagah border crossing
It was an unprecedented and emotional moment.
Mohammad Arif's wife gave him up as dead and remarried.
After five years in captivity, Jagsir Singh and Mohammed Arif arrived in India from prison in Pakistan to be greeted by their family and a flurry of journalists.
It was if they were returning from the dead.
Both soldiers of the Indian Army, they were taken prisoner by Pakistani troops in the Kargil sector of Indian-administered Kashmir. Unbearable strain
Because their capture was not recorded, they were listed as 'deserters' when they failed to return to their unit.
Disgraced by what they were alleged to have done, the families of each man were forced to bear great hardship including constant harassment by police.
It was the first time that Jagsir Singh met his daughter
So unbearable was the strain endured by Jagsir Singh's father, he died a broken man while his son was in captivity. Similarly, Mohammed Arif's mother died pining to see her favourite, younger son again.
But on Monday the two men were able to cast aside allegations of desertion by dramatically walking into India as released prisoners of war rather than returning deserters. They were greeted with the same kind of euphoria that Nelson Mandela received after his walk out of prison. Only a few months ago, the Pakistan Army finally acknowledged that they had been taken prisoner after the Kargil war of 1999. Up until then, their imprisonment had been denied. Sweets and garlands
Shortly afterwards, Jagsir Singh was allowed to write a letter to his mother from his cell in Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail.
It was the sort of beyond-the-grave story normally associated with fiction, and explains why they were accorded a hero's welcome on Monday.
Received at the Zero Line by senior army and Border Security Force officers, the two Indians were sent home with gifts of sweets and rose garlands by their captors in Pakistan.
Smiling in delight, they walked the last few steps home to a series of emotional and tear-filled bear-hugs by impatient family members.
The servicemen were ushered away by waiting officials
Jagsir Singh's mother, Chhoto Kaur, embraced her son so tightly it looked like she would never let him go. Finally free from his mother's clutches, the returning serviceman was able for the first time to behold his young daughter, Saroj. A little girl now, Saroj was born nearly a month after Jagsir's Singh's capture.
Also there to greet him was his wife, Jaswinder Singh, her cheeks flowing with tears of happiness. Remarried
He had been absent for so long that she had been forced to leave Saroj with her mother-in-law and return to her family.
But of the blue last week she received a letter from her husband in Pakistan. It said that he would be coming home soon. "I never imagined it would be so soon," Jaswinder said.
For Mohammed Arif, Monday's homecoming was no less emotional.
Besides learning about the death of his mother, the soldier also bravely dealt with the news that his wife had given him up as dead and had remarried.
It was amid these powerful emotions that the two soldiers were whisked away by military officials for what was described as "a detailed de-briefing session."
A senior army official deputed to receive the soldiers said the circumstances of their capture and the apparent mistake in declaring them deserters would be the subjected to a comprehensive inquiry.
Earlier in the day, the Indian authorities also released and repatriated a Pakistani soldier, Saleem Ali Shah, and three Pakistani civilian nationals. It is likely that there were similar scenes of jubilation there as well: all very unusual for a part of the world where the ongoing conflict has meant that such delirious happiness is not often seen.

Millions of memories at the Savoy
By Sarah Bell
BBC News
An Art Deco jewel by the river, the Savoy has been attracting the great, the good and the infamous since its first guests arrived in 1889.
Frank Sinatra allegedly tinkled the ivories during one of his stays
From royalty to Hollywood greats, artists, politicians and even the odd murderer - if you visited the capital, you stayed on the Strand. And it seems for many, the world-famous hotel is not just a collection of bedrooms, but embodies the social history of modern London.
Staff were called as witnesses at Oscar Wilde's trial, Claude Monet painted views of the Thames from its windows and its chef invented the Peach Melba. It remained open during both World Wars, and in 1941 Noel Coward stood in for a bandmaster who was knocked off his feet when a bomb dropped on the Embankment.
But it is personal memories which are driving collectors to spend ï¿½30 on a catalogue and browse round the 3,000 items being sold in its grand auction.
From honeymoons to weddings and special afternoon teas, the Savoy has hosted millions of moments which remain in peoples' memories. Blaze of publicity
One browser, James Tuten, who has been visiting the hotel for 40 years, was taking one last look before it undergoes a ï¿½100m refurbishment.
A look back at a life of luxury In pictures He and his wife Judith even had a quick twirl in the ballroom while no-one was looking. He explains what makes the Savoy so special: "It almost reflects the history in London. It really is a beacon, everything seems to gravitate here."
The Savoy made an impact from the moment it opened in a blaze of publicity - and light - as the hotel was one of the first public buildings in Britain to be lit by electricity.
It had its own power company which supplied electricity to part of the Strand. The brainchild of theatrical impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte, it was also the first London hotel to have electric lifts, which were imported from America.
The first part of the hotel was built in Edwardian style, with Art Deco interiors added with a new extension in the early 1900s, before the style became widely popular.
"One of our directors once said the Savoy was always up-to-date, and if possible just a little bit ahead," the Savoy's archivist, Susan Scott says.
'Elegance and style'
Now the hotel has closed its doors to undergo a restoration which promises to honour its heritage.
It could be argued the restoration is a little overdue, with some browsers saying the items on sale were very worn and would need repair. GLAMOROUS GUESTS

In fact, one lamp sporting a lot tag in the ladies' lavatory was scorched by years of lighting people up as they powdered their noses. So what is so special about a hotel which makes people want to grab its fixtures and fittings, even if they are worn?
"The Savoy occupies a unique place in hotel history and set a benchmark for the hotels which followed," she says.
"It became the by-word for elegance and style and became the absolute pinnacle of the social scene in London," she says.
In its heyday, visitors to London would come and sit in one of the bars and be guaranteed to see the great and the good.
"From that auspicious start it could only get better. I have never met anyone who has been here and not had a wonderful time.
"I cannot imagine another hotel which means so much to so many people."

Leigh clinch promotion glory
Leigh RMI hope Conference will bring more success
Leigh RMI claimed their place in the Nationwide Conference after capturing the UniBond Premier League title in fine style.
The Greater Manchester minnows went top of the table last November and remained front-runners through to the end, despite strong challenges from Hyde and Gateshead.
Their success surprised because few pundits had tipped Leigh to perform so well in what was a highly competitive division.
Tony Black and Steve Jones both scored 18 league goals while Brian Ross chipped in with 16. Jones scooped all the major awards at the RMI presentation evening. He collected the Players' Player Trophy, Supporters' Player and the Young Player of the Year trophies.
Goalkeeper Dave Felgate, who has vast experience in the League, also played an important role for RMI.
Manager Steve Waywell received great support from ambitious chairman Chris Healy as the Hilton Park club geared itself for a step up to the Conference just four years after moving Horwich.
The club upgraded its facilities to make their ground eligible for the step up to the Conference and will now be looking for greater support to help them compete with other clubs at this level.
