South east Europe vulnerable to Greek contagion
By Jorn Madslien
Business reporter, BBC News
Jobs and livelihoods across South East Europe could be at risk if the Greek debt crisis spreads across the region
The Greek debt crisis has been widely seen as a problem for the European Union, amidst concerns that other heavily indebted countries could suffer similar difficulties.But the risks that the crisis will spread to neighbouring countries in south east Europe could be even greater, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) warns. With regards to your question, 'could there be a coincidence of the three risks', the answer is clearly yes
EBRD President Thomas Mirow
"I see three possibilities of contagion," says Thomas Mirow, president of the EBRD. Firstly, he says, if Greece's difficulties spill over into the rest of the European Union, countries in south east Europe could see their exports to these key markets suffer. Secondly, concerns about economic stability could spook investors who might then become reluctant to invest in the region, given the relatively greater risks involved. Thirdly, if Greek banks run into difficulty, it could cause a credit crunch in neighbouring countries, notably Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia, where their subsidiaries are active and important players in the financial markets. Tighter beltsConcerns about economic difficulties in many European countries are very real. Reduced faith in the Greek banking system is pushing up borrowing costs
Already, the value of the euro has fallen sharply as a result of fears that the Greek debt crisis could spread. Portugal's credit worthiness has already been downgraded and earlier this week the prime minister of Spain, Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, was forced to deny rumours that Spain would be next to seek financial assistance. But even if the Greek crisis is contained, it is clear that belts must be tightened in many European Union countries. "For some time, the market may have underestimated this very considerable debt the sovereigns have taken to overcome this crisis," Mr Mirow observes "With the amount and the level of debt many states have taken on, there will be an impact on real economies. Austerity measures will need to be taken, not only by Greece." Prudent investorsInvestor confidence, severely knocked by the Greek crisis, was further dented by a political brawl in Germany that has seen Chancellor Angela Merkel accused of failing to provide leadership and build confidence in the single currency. It is easy to elaborate on what could be a worst case scenario - and it is certainly scary - but it does not make much sense at the moment
EBRD President Thomas Mirow
Thursday night's chaos on Wall Street, when an apparent error by a trader contributed to extremely volatile trading, was an indication of how fickle and nervous the markets are at the moment. Though more important as far as south east Europe is concerned is investors' behaviour during periods of political and economic uncertainty. During previous crisis, such as the Asian financial crisis, the Russian financial crisis or Argentina's debt default during the late 1990s, investors fled emerging markets and flocked to "quality", shifting their investment on a large scale into stable industries or other assets in sound economies. New energy generation projects in former Soviet states, or new industries that aim to help these states diversify are unlikely to be deemed "quality", so there is every chance such investment opportunities will lie well beyond the radars of many a prudent investor for months to come. Bank relianceEqually real are the difficulties faced by the Greek banks. Their customers, both companies and consumers, will be finding it harder in future to repay their debts so defaults may rise sharply. Reduced bank lending could hit the region's industry hard
The value of the banks' collateral, such as government bonds, is falling "thus weakening capital ratios and the ability of banks to lend", and thus conceivably their willingness to continue supporting their subsidiaries in neighbouring countries, according to IHS Global Insight banking analyst Toby Wight. The credit worthiness of Greek companies and in turn Greek banks is thus being downgraded, hence both these banks and their customers will have to pay higher interest rates on the money they borrow. The consequence could be that many companies in south east Europe will be starved of loans, which in turn could result in bankruptcies and job losses. Knock-on effectSo there are real reasons to worry about each of the three threats to south east Europe's economies. Moreover, given the way global economic events often impact on each other, there is every chance that either of the three events occurring could increase the chance of the other two happening too, Mr Mirow acknowledges. But though the risks are real, Mr Mirow is eager to stress that "we are talking about potential risks". "We haven't seen any major [contagion] effect. Greek bank subsidiaries have behaved well," he says. Moreover, he says, the EBRD is in talks with the International Monetary Fund to identify ways to protect the rest of south east Europe from any spill-over from Greece, for instance by providing Greek bank subsidiaries with capital and liquidity. "It is easy to elaborate on what could be a worst case scenario - and it is certainly scary - but it does not make much sense at the moment," Mr Mirow insists.

Rare Turner works go online
Users can assemble their own online Turner gallery
Thousands of sketches, paintings and watercolours by JMW Turner hardly seen since the 19th Century have gone online.
The Tate gallery, with the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund, has opened online access to the entire Turner Bequest. The bequest was given to the nation after the painter's death in 1851 and contains nearly 300 paintings and over 30,000 watercolours and drawings - normally kept in the vaults of Tate Britain and seen only on request.
The great thing is you can see how he evolved and progressed his ideas
David Brown, Turner expert The project also allows users to search Turner's works by geographical location and offers digitally-enhanced viewing of some of the fainter drawings and sketches.
Turner specialist David Brown told BBC Breakfast: "It is an extraordinary resource, the Turner Bequest - these thousands and thousands of drawings and watercolours and sketchbooks that Turner used over many years - they tell us an incredible amount about his work.
"Turner sold most of his finished paintings and watercolours, and this is a marvellous way of looking at the artist at work.
Favourite works
"The great thing is you can see how he evolved and progressed his ideas - you can follow through from sketches he did on the spot to more developed ideas."
Users can also assemble their own online catalogue of favourite works. Many watercolours were studies for later oils
The work is part of the Insight project, designed to put the entire Tate vault online, and the uploading of the Turner Bequest will mean that over 50,000 works from the Tate collection have been imaged and indexed by the Insight team.
"We do represent the works very accurately on screen and with something like the Turner bequest that's very, very important because a lot of the sketches are very faint," said the Tate's Oliver Vicker-Harris.
"If you do get to an image which is a bit faint and you can't see properly you can view a digitally enhanced version." But Mr Vicker-Harris added that that the intention of the Insight project was to widen access to the Tate collections - and not to replace the experience of coming to the Tate galleries.

In pics: Girl's story of life as a refugee
This is Gervelie, 13, who likes reading Jacqueline Wilson, but she's also got an interesting story of her own. She's written a book about her experience as a refugee.
She visited her old school in Norwich to tell kids what it was like when she lived in Africa. "We couldn't go outside as there were people being killed if they went out at certain times."
Rose, 11, was shocked at Gervelie's story of life in the Congo and the Ivory Coast. "It makes me feel really lucky that none of this is going on where we live," she said.
And Rowan, 10, added: "To think that other people are going through the same thing is just unreal. It's not how life is supposed to be."
Philip, 10, said: "I think it must have been really hard for Gervelie when she first came here, because she didn't speak English and so couldn't talk to anyone except for her Dad."
Sam, 11, added: "I've always been interested in geography, but knowing Gervelie has made me more interested. When I'm older I'd like to do something to help people like her."

Borders 35-25 Blues
CELTIC LEAGUE
Borders (10) 35Tries: Weston, MacRae, Warnock, Brown Cons: Warnock 3 Pens: Warnock 2, Hore Blues (17) 25
Tries: Sowden-Taylor, Powell, Morgan Cons: L Thomas 2 Pen: L Thomas 2 Att: 900
Video highlights from Scrum V
Borders shrugged off their injury worries as they came from behind to break their Celtic League duck and defeat The Blues at Netherdale.
Tries by Robin Sowden-Taylor and Ryan Powell had put the visitors in charge before Jonny Weston replied.
Craig Morgan went over for the Blues, but Calum MacRae and Ally Warnock hit back again for the home side.
Kelly Brown forced his way across for the clincher - and Warnock made sure of victory with a last-gasp penalty. Cardiff had looked on course to avenge last season's defeat on the same turf until three tries in six minutes earned the Borders a precious bonus point.
Lee Thomas' early penalty for the Blues was cancelled out by a similar strike at the other end by Warnock.
Cardiff seized the initiative with two well-worked tries in quick succession.
Flanker Sowden-Taylor surged over to give Thomas a simple conversion.
And, four minutes later, scrum-half Powell darted through a narrow gap to reach the line, with Thomas again on target.
Borders rallied late in the first half, with number eight Brown's expert pick-up from the scrum base paving the way for Weston to burrow over - Warnock adding the extras.
There was drama after the restart as Warnock was yellow-carded for a deliberate knock-on - allowing Thomas to bag another penalty.
But Charlie Hore replied for the Borders almost immediately.
The action moved up a gear when Morgan went over for the third Blues touchdown - only for Borders to carve out two of their own in quickfire order through MacRae and Warnock, who slotted both conversions.
The thrilling revival continued as Brown grabbed a late try and Warnock settled the issue with a penalty.
