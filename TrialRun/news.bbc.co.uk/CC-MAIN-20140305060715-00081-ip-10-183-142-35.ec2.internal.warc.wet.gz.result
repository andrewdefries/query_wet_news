US birth-rate mirrors recession
Fewer babies are being born in the economic downturn
Newly-released US census figures show a strong slowdown in the birth-rate that began before the economic crisis hit.The number of babies born grew by only 0.9% in the year to July 2008, compared with a rise of 2.7% the year before. The figures have given rise to speculation that families anticipated hard times by having fewer children. "If prospects look worse for families, they're going to be very likely to have fewer kids," said Mark Mather of the Population Research Bureau. The surprising part of the figures is that they reflect family planning decisions made from early 2007, when there were only a few signs of an economic slowdown in the US. The first real sign of the financial meltdown was in August 2007 when credit markets froze up, but unemployment was still low and consumer confidence high. 'Holding back'Stephanie Ventura, a demographer at the National Center for Health Statistics, which compiled the figures, told the Associated Press news agency it was too early to be sure why there were fewer pregnancies. But "it is a very good question" to ask about the effect of the economic slowdown, she said. "They might have wanted to hold back" until economic conditions were more settled. There were absolute declines in the number of births in 13 of the 50 US states, including some of the poorest, such as Louisiana and Mississippi, while North Dakota, which showed strong economic growth due to an oil boom, had the biggest increase in births. High house prices, which peaked in 2006, may have also played a role in discouraging couples from having more children. And more recently, there is evidence that immigration into the US has dropped sharply, further lowering the population growth rate. Half of all children under five in the US are from minority households. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Scientist warns on human cloning
Many countries have different laws on embryo research
By Science Correspondent Ania Lichtarowicz in Brussels
A leading ethicist has warned the European Commission's conference on stem cell research that strict laws may not be enough to stop some scientists trying to clone humans. There will always be people who do not obey laws, who will not accept them, but there is nothing we can really do about that at this stage
Professor Nielsen
The conference, in Brussels, is intended to provide a forum for politicians, ethicists and scientists to exchange views, and help Europe adopt a common position on the issue. Professor Linda Neilsen from Copenhagen University told delegates that laws might not prevent pro-cloning scientists like Dr Severino Antonori and Dr Panos Zavos from carrying out their plans.
"There will always be people who do not obey laws, who will not accept them, but there is nothing we can really do about that at this stage," she told the conference.
One question being asked at the conference is where such scientists could legally carry out cloning, as many countries around the world have banned it.
Cultural differences
Professor Neilsen believes that cultural differences will mean that some issues concerning stem cell research - the controversial field of medicine where cells can be taken from human embryos or aborted foetuses - may never be resolved. In some European countries like Germany and Norway, using embryonic stem cells is banned. Others, like the UK, have special bodies that control this type of work. But Spain and Belgium, for instance, are still debating what type of legislation to have. Along with many scientists and policy-makers here in Brussels, Professor Neilsen thinks that a Europe-wide policy will only cover certain issues that countries can learn to compromise on. The conference is aimed at clarifying the position that European Union countries will eventually adopt. Delegates include ministers, scientists, businesspeople and specialists in ethics.

Christmas message for Madeleine
The appeal includes previously unseen pictures of Madeleine
The message
The parents of Madeleine McCann have sent a Christmas message to their missing daughter in a new video appeal for information.
Kate and Gerry McCann say their only Christmas wish is to have their daughter back.
Madeleine, four, vanished from the family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal on 3 May.
The couple remain official suspects, but have always denied any involvement in her disappearance.
'Despair and anguish'
The worldwide appeal, recorded at their home in Rothley, Leicestershire, includes previously unseen clips of Madeleine filmed last Christmas. The McCanns promoted an appeal hotline number
In one she is shown opening a parcel containing a pink suitcase which she took on holiday in May.
The couple believe their daughter is still alive, and have employed private investigators in their search for her.
In the first part of the video the couple talk about the possibility that someone knows what happened to their daughter.
They make a direct appeal to such a person to end their "despair and anguish".
Mr McCann says: "This special time of year is all about families coming together with love and peace.
"Clearly for us and the rest of our family it's going to be the hardest Christmas imaginable without Madeleine here."
Appealing for information, Kate McCann says: "You must understand that you hold the key to ending all this despair and anguish, for both us and Madeleine.
"At this time of year, when so many families are coming together we beg you to help us be reunited with Madeleine.
"Please do the right thing and come forward."
'Love you'
Speaking directly to Madeleine, Kate McCann said it "seems unlikely that you'll hear this but, just in case, it's Mummy and Daddy here...
"Just know how much we love you, Madeleine. We all miss you so much."
She said Madeleine's brother and sister, two-year-old twins Sean and Amelie, "talk about you all the time every day". Mrs McCann added: "We're doing everything we can, Madeleine, to find you and there are so many good and very kind people helping us.
"Our only Christmas wish is for you to be back with us again and we're hoping and praying that that will happen."
The couple appeal for anyone with information to call a confidential hotline run by a Spain-based private detective agency.

Lennon school book up for auction
Lennon's signature is on the front of the brown paper-covered book
One of John Lennon's old school exercise books is expected to fetch up to �90,000 at a forthcoming auction.
Compiled by Lennon in Liverpool in 1952, the book contains eight drawings in pen, pencil and watercolour, depicting verses from classic poems.
One of the poems was Lewis Carroll's The Walrus And The Carpenter which inspired the 1967 Beatles song, I Am The Walrus.
The book will go on sale on Thursday at Sotheby's in London.
The brown paper-covered book, inscribed with the words My Anthology, was kept by Lennon's teacher at Quarry Bank High School, Lancelot Burrows.
'Artistic talent'
It features Lennon's signature on the front, now half torn away, and a mock coat of arms.
Mr Burrows gave each drawing a mark out of 10 and the lowest Lennon received was an eight.
Other illustrations depict scenes from poems by Robert Southey, William Cowper and Michael Drayton.
Sotheby's English literature specialist, Tessa Milne, said: "These drawings are remarkably accomplished for one so young and the book is a wonderful example of Lennon's emerging artistic talent."
Included in the lot is a class photograph of Form 1R from 1952, showing Lennon in the back row.

Crime gang's Audi 4x4 now police patrol car
The car will be used by Strathclyde Police's Gangs Task Force
A £40,000 car which once belonged to criminals in Glasgow is now being used by the police in the fight against serious crime.The black Q7 was seized by officers from Strathclyde police during an operation against a criminal gang in the north of the city. The 4x4 car has now been emblazoned with the force's livery and will be used by the Gangs Task Force. This is the first time Strathclyde Police has used a confiscated vehicle. Assistant Chief Constable John Neilson said: "I would say to the criminals that what you have this week; your houses, your cars - you might not have next week. "The hard working, law abiding citizens need to know that we are hurting those involved in serious and organised crime where it matters - their pockets.

Question Time: OFMDFM and Finance
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. First Minister Peter Robinson said "it must be a cause for concern" that so many young people were passing through the education system without the qualifications necessary to find a good job, on 14 January 2013.He was replying to a question from the UUP leader, Mike Nesbitt, on how the Social Investment Fund could be used to target educational underachievement among Protestant working class boys. Mr Nesbitt observed that the matter had been to the fore at a recent meeting of the unionist forum on Belfast's Newtownards Road. Stewart Dickson of Alliance wanted reassurance that the Social Investment Fund would not be seen as "a reward for violence". "It will be a rigorous process as it would be for any government spend," the first minister replied. Finance Minister Sammy Wilson was asked by the SDLP's Colum Eastwood on help for businesses that have suffered losses due to the recent flag protests. Mr Wilson criticised the SDLP for backing the decision to restrict the flying of the union flag on Belfast City Hall to designated days. It was, he said, "a very bad decision that didn't have to be made in the first instance". The minister said there might be some scope for help for businesses involved in the "night-time economy". Mr Eastwood urged Mr Wilson to consider the matter with a sense of urgency. "If these thing go on any longer a lot of them are going to go out of business," he said. SEE ALSO

Colchester 0 - 2 Southampton
Colchester 0-2 Southampton
Dean Hammond scored against his former side and helped Southampton to a win against 10-man Colchester.A deflected Rickie Lambert free-kick fell to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who struck from close range to put the visitors ahead. The home side were reduced to 10 men when David Mooney was dismissed for pushing Danny Butterfield. Hammond fired in a low effort from the edge of the area to double the Saints' lead and seal the points. Colchester United manager John Ward told BBC Essex: "It was a good game, 11 against 11. I thought we had given as good as we got. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "We restricted them to the opportunities they got. They got a break off the free-kick, but we always knew Lambert was dangerous, but we dealt with that and it dropped for them. "The sending off changes the whole nature of the afternoon for everybody, not just the players but the supporters as well." Southampton manager Nigel Adkins told BBC Radio Solent: You've got to come away from home and weather the storm.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "Great discipline from the players especially Lee Barnard who kept getting booted. He didn't retaliate which is what we talked about at half-time. "The players bounced back after the disappointment the other day, kept a good clean sheet and got a good valuable three points."
