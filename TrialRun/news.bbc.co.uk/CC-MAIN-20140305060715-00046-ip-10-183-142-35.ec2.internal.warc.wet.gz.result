UN urges North Korea-US talks
Mr Strong said North Korea wanted to join the internatinal community
The UN envoy to North Korea, Maurice Strong, has said that Washington and Pyongyang are close together on fundamental issues but are hampered by their lack of direct communication.
Speaking ahead of a UN Security Council meeting on North Korea next week, Mr Strong told journalists in London that the 9 April forum could be "contentious" but represented a chance for steps towards peace.
However, Mr Strong did warn that the crisis could quickly escalate, and that conflict on the Korean peninsula was "entirely possible".
He said that both North Korea and the US believed they had time on their side, but that "the longer they wait... the more risk there is of incidents that will provoke a hardening of attitudes".
A series of moves by North Korea since late last year has created extreme tension in the region. Pyongyang has restarted its nuclear facilities, expelled UN inspectors and withdrawn from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
North Korea, Mr Strong said, contends that the US was responsible for the crisis by itself breaching the NPT, which should allow non-nuclear powers freedom from threats from nuclear-armed states.
He said Pyongyang considered itself threatened by a series of statements from the US, including Washington's stated right to pre-emptive attack, and its branding North Korea part of an "axis of evil".
Mr Strong said that the North wanted a security guarantee from the US and a lifting of economic restrictions, while the US wanted the North to abandon its nuclear programmes and rejoin the NPT in return for economic assistance.
"The paradox is that on the fundamental issues the two sides are saying more or less what the other side is demanding... but they haven't been able to say it to each other directly," he said.
This is because the North has insisted on bilateral talks with the US while Washington is adamant that the issue is international and any discussions should involve other countries.
The North Koreans are prepared for war, but anxious for peace
UN envoy Maurice Strong
The North, he said, agreed that multilateral talks should take place, but only after direct talks with the US - the other primary player in the dispute.
"I'm satisfied now that the modalities can be bridged," he said. "It should be quite feasible... to accommodate both positions." Mr Strong stressed repeatedly that "the North Koreans are prepared for war, but anxious for peace".
He said that he did not judge the "odds" of war were very high, but that a 50-year build-up of lack of trust meant it could easily happen. The North has warned that if the Security Council chooses to impose sanctions, it would consider the move an "act of war".
But Mr Strong said that at least two Security Council members were against sanctions, and that he "would hope that it will begin... first steps along a pathway to a peaceful resolution rather than to escalating the conflict".
North Korea on Friday blasted the decision by the US to impose trade sanctions on its missile marketing agency for selling missile technology to Pakistan.
"It is our sovereign right to produce, deploy or export missiles to other countries," its official KCNA news agency said in a report, noting that it was not bound by no legal restrictions.
The agency on Thursday also reported the movements of the North's leader, Kim Jong-il, for the first time in 50 days.
He was reported to have visited a military medical school in Pyongyang. There has been speculation that Mr Kim has been holed up with his military generals, preparing for a US strike on the North.
Mr Strong said that the war in Iraq had created "clear concern" in Pyongyang, as the US was carrying out its stated right to pre-emptive strikes.
"They believe that they are next on the list," he said.

Red tape 'wastes teachers' time'
Computers could cut down on times spent on paperwork
By BBC Scotland Education Correspondent Kenneth Macdonald.
Cutting time-consuming paperwork in schools would be the equivalent to hiring 1,500 extra teachers, says an official report. Scotland's teachers are spending too much time on paperwork, says the report - the first to be produced jointly by Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools and the independent spending watchdog, the Accounts Commission for Scotland.
The report found teachers were spending between 15% and 50% of their time on paperwork and concluded that councils and schools should cut down on inefficient administration. Among the recommendations were for more streamlined paperwork, better use of computers and more support for teachers, either by using more support staff or using classroom assistants. The school inspectors say that moves have already been made to cut unnecessary paperwork. But they say that while the bureaucracy that remains is necessary, asking teachers to do it all is getting in the way of teaching. Teachers' leaders have been complaining for years that a mountain of paper has been hampering education. They are likely to seize on this report as proof that they were right all along.
In England and Wales teachers' unions have been campaigning for a similar recognition of the need to cut bureaucracy.
The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers last year staged a 'Let Teachers Teach' campaign, which claimed that paperwork was interrupting effective teaching.
The government responded with guidelines to reduce unnecessary administration, but the union does not believe that the measures have gone far enough to lift the bureaucratic burden.
The union says it is difficult for many schools to implement a limit on paperwork when there is "a constant flow of new documents" and policies such as the literacy hour.

Avebury and Stonehenge linked with new walking route
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
It is hoped a new 30-mile walking route linking the world heritage sites of Avebury and Stonehenge will become one of the most popular footpaths in Britain. The Great Stones Way will be launched in 2011 but there are concerns about erosion at some of the ancient heritage sites along the route. BBC Points West's Scott Ellis reports.

1994: Royal approval for oil drilling at Windsor
The Queen has given the go ahead for oil drilling to take place in the grounds of Windsor Castle.
Exploratory work could get underway as early as next summer at the popular tourist spot.
The move comes after studies showed there could be up to �1bn of oil lying beneath the castle, in Berkshire, which is still being repaired after fire ripped through it two years ago.
Canadian Dr Desmond Oswald and his wife Olive, who own Canuk Explorations which is behind the plan, estimate there is a one-in-eight chance of finding enough oil to fill 100 million barrels.
The drilling is expected to reach a depth of 300 m (984 ft) and would take place at Home Park which is situated about 500 m (1,640 ft) from the castle wall.
New technology means if oil is discovered it can be drilled underground from a well positioned about one mile away (1.6 km).
It is bound to lead to Windsor Great Park being turned almost into a second Dallas
Dennis Outwin, mayor of Windsor and Maidenhead
There is mounting opposition from local councillors who fear the plans could harm the area and turn it into a Berkshire version of "Dallas".
Dennis Outwin, mayor of Windsor and Maidenhead, is enraged by the plans.
"I do not believe you can get 100 million barrels of oil just through a small pipeline," he told the BBC.
"In my opinion, it is bound to lead to Windsor Great Park being turned almost into a second Dallas."
Conservationists are also opposed to the plans.
A spokesman for Greenpeace said areas of historical and natural heritage must be preserved for the nation.
But Dr Oswald said people had nothing to fear.
"The surface ground will be restored to its original condition and there would be no surface manifestation what so ever that anything had taken place at the site," he said.
Berkshire County Council has yet to make a decision on the controversial proposals.

In Context
"Dallas-on-Thames" - as it was dubbed in the media - was approved by Berkshire County Council less than a month later.
It was assured noise and pollution would be kept to a minimum from the 18 m (60 ft) high mobile drilling rig and 366 m (1,200 ft) borehole.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England said the drilling would damage the environment, increase traffic and harm the parkland, which is in the protected Green Belt.
The first exploration well was due to be sunk in the summer of 1996.
But when the six-year licence held by Canuk Explorations neared expiry that year, the Department of Trade and Industry, did not renew it.
The DTI gave no reasons for its decision.

What's gone wrong in the north east?
Shearer, Southgate and Sbragia are all facing relegation
It has been a season to forget in the north east.Middlesbrough are on the brink of relegation, while Newcastle and Sunderland are also battling to avoid dropping out of the Premier League. BBC Local Radio's commentators in the region have witnessed the trio's struggles at close quarters and are well placed to analyse their respective predicaments. Here, they look at what has gone wrong at Newcastle, Sunderland and Middlesbrough and explore how things can be turned round. Nick Barnes, BBC Radio Newcastle's Sunderland AFC commentator
Can you put your finger on what has gone so wrong this season, both for your own club and north east football in general?Looking at Sunderland, the problems arose from Roy Keane's transfer dealings in the summer. He bought unwisely - the significant mistakes were El Hadji Diouf and Pascal Chimbonda - but then the loan of Djibril Cisse has, with hindsight, also proved to have been a mistake. The first two players, and latterly Cisse, disrupted the strong team spirit that had been embodied by Sunderland the previous season and Ricky Sbragia, while enjoying a brief honeymoon period, inherited a fractured squad made up of too many individuals and not a squad built for togetherness and graft.
606: DEBATE
Can Sunderland stay up?
Generally speaking, the three north east teams have each suffered from different problems which coincidentally have all collided at the same time. I don't believe there's a general north east 'disease'. Newcastle's problems are the culmination of several years of rudderless direction from the very top; Middlesbrough's from, much like Sunderland, poor transfer dealings and to a degree an inexperienced manager. How far should the manager(s) carry the can, or the owners for hiring/firing/keeping faith with their bosses?In Sunderland's case, Roy Keane clearly has to be held ultimately responsible. Ricky Sbragia inherited the problems. But Niall Quinn can't be blamed as chairman for gambling with Keane - his profile was enormous for the club. Should the worst happen, is your club capable of sustaining Premier League wages in the Championship, bearing in mind fate of Norwich, Charlton and Saints this season? Would the club implode as a consequence of relegation?Sunderland have inbuilt relegation clauses in the contracts of all the players which would see their wages cut to sustainable levels in the Championship. Their previous experiences of relegation has ensured they won't make the same mistakes as in the past. Has there been a highlight this season?Sunderland's highlight without question was their victory over Newcastle United at the Stadium of Light. Is your club capable of coming straight back up/move up the league next season?On both counts, the answer is yes. Mick Lowes, BBC Radio Newcastle's Newcastle United commentator
Can you put your finger on what has gone so wrong this season, both for your own club and north east football in general?Difficult to say with regard to the region as a whole. Each of the three have very different identities, but clearly the same basic problem - they haven't won enough games. But I don't think the north east is doing anything worse than, say the north west, where Wigan, Bolton and Blackburn have all survived. With regard to Newcastle United the answer is simple; too much chopping and changing equals too much turmoil and a lack of direction. How far should the manager(s) carry the can, or the owners for hiring/firing/keeping faith with their bosses?In the main, the hiring and firing of managers is a results-driven business - not so at Newcastle United this season. Four different managers (if you include Chris Hughton who had two periods as caretaker) in a season which was never anything but mediocre (at best!). 606: DEBATE
Can Newcastle cope with relegation?
The single biggest factor was the Kevin Keegan fall-out, which should have been handled better/never been allowed to happen. The majority of blame has to be with the club's hierarchy. Should the worst happen, is your club capable of sustaining Premier League wages? Would the club implode as a consequence of relegation?It's impossible for Newcastle to sustain their wage bill in the Championship. Of the club's £100m revenue, more than £70m goes on wages. Relegation would mean an almost complete fire sale of players. Whether the club subsequently implodes remains to be seen and, to a large extent, hinges on whether Alan Shearer is in charge next season. Has there been a highlight this season?No. Is your club capable of coming straight back up/move up the league next season?Undoubtedly yes, on both counts - with the right man in charge. Alastair Brownlee, BBC Tees' Middlesbrough commentator
Can you put your finger on what has gone so wrong this season, both for your own club and north-east football in general?For Middlesbrough the main problem has been a lack of goals. Afonso Alves was bought for a record Boro transfer fee and has failed to deliver, scoring only four league goals this season. It's not just Alves, though, who has been disappointing in front of goal - the team has scored just 27 goals going into the final match which is not good enough.
FOOTBALL BLOG
Research shows that top players don't enjoy greater success as managers
BBC Sport's Simon Austin
When you add to the lack of goals a run of 11 successive defeats away from home, which set a club record going back to the formation of the Boro in 1876, it's not hard to see why we are facing relegation. At Newcastle there is a complete lack of stability. When Boro played at St James' Park recently Alan Shearer was the eighth Newcastle boss that Gareth Southgate had faced since he was appointed in 2006. Meanwhile at Sunderland, the problem is the same as Boro, a lack of goals costing the club dearly. How far should the manager(s) carry the can, or the owners for hiring/firing/keeping faith with their bosses?Steve Gibson is a very loyal chairman and has backed Southgate. True, there is not the financial muscle that we saw in 1996 when the likes of Juninho, Emerson and Fabrizio Ravanelli came to the Riverside and Gareth has had to reduce the age and size of the squad. But ultimately the manager must look at whether he has been able to get the best from a group of players that should be much higher than second bottom. Should the worst happen, is your club capable of sustaining Premier League wages? Will the club implode as a consequence of relegation?Boro will certainly not implode; there is a great academy that produces players capable of playing first-team football and as long as Steve Gibson continues to support the club, and there is no sign that he will not, the club will survive.
606: DEBATE
Discuss the final day of the season
Relegation will certainly be a blow but the club have I am sure already put in place plans. Has there been a highlight this season?Beating Liverpool 2-0 at the Riverside on 28 February was a great performance. When Tuncay scored the second I thought the roof would lift off the stadium and that the victory would be the springboard to safety. Is your club capable of coming straight back up/move up the league next season?The club is capable of coming back, providing the right type of players are bought in the summer to compliment the young talent already there. There will inevitably be some departures but will the money be spent wisely? That is the key.

Ferguson banned for two matches
Ferguson was sent to the stands by referee Clattenburg
Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has been banned from the touchline for two matches by the Football Association.
Ferguson admitted using abusive and/or insulting words towards referee Mark Clattenburg during the game against Bolton on 24 November.
The ban starts on 28 December so the Scot will be in the dugout for Sunday's match against Liverpool at Anfield.
Ferguson, who did not attend the hearing, was also fined �5,000.
The Premier League champions will be without their manager for the trip to West Ham on Saturday 29 December and the New Year's day fixture at home to Birmingham.
The United boss was sent to the stands by Clattenburg following a half-time rant during their 1-0 defeat at the Reebok Stadium.
Standards must be slipping because there have been some bad tackles recently
Sir Alex Ferguson
He said after the match that he had told the referee "exactly what he thought of him".
He continued: "Some referees don't like it. They don't like the truth. But I just told him how bad he was in the first-half."
Ferguson was upset with what he felt was a lack of protection for his players against what he claimed were "over-aggressive" tactics from Gary Megson's side.
And one tackle by Kevin Davies on Patrice Evra prompted an infuriated Ferguson into a finger-jabbing rant as Clattenburg entered the tunnel at half-time.
Ferguson said he believes refereeing standards are 'slipping' within the English game.
606: DEBATE
How will United fare against Liverpool on Sunday?
Though the United boss openly admitted he had missed a pre-season briefing for managers by referees' chief Keith Hackett, he believes one of the central components of the discussion has been ignored.
"At the summer conference, Keith Hackett was on about tackling from behind," he said.
"He made a promise to the managers that tackles with raised feet off the ground would be a red card and that tackles from the back would be a red card.
"Standards must be slipping because there have been some bad tackles recently, not just in our games but in quite a few others.
"And what happens then is that if someone gets seriously injured, who gets the blame? The referee gets the blame."

Abandoned race hands Lindsey Vonn super-combined title
Vonn began skiing aged two and is the most successful US skier of all time
Olympic downhill champion Lindsey Vonn won the super-combined World Cup title after the final event of the season was abandoned because of gale-force winds.With the World Cup finals in Germany just days away, organisers opted not to switch Friday's race in Switzerland. After the only two races in the discipline, Vonn had a 10-point lead. The 25-year-old American, who also leads the overall and downhill World Cup standings, has already won the World Cup super-G title this term. It continues a dominant run of form for Vonn, who became the first American gold medallist in the downhill at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver last month.
606: DEBATE
What's your reaction to Vonn's victory Soon after wrapping up the super-G title with two races to spare, Vonn injured her right leg while training in Austria. However, she battled back to win gold in the downhill at Whistler ahead of fellow American Julia Mancuso, but then missed out on a double gold after falling in the slalom portion of the super-combined event.
