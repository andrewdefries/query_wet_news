FBI chief steps down
Freeh may be considering working in the private sector
The chief of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis Freeh, has decided to quit his job after a 27-year-long career in government. It's his choice. He didn't give specific reasons for that decision
FBI spokesman Bill Carter
In a statement, Mr Freeh announced he would retire by the end of the school year in June but did not give specific reasons for his decision. Mr Freeh, a former federal prosecutor and federal judge in New York City, was appointed to a 10-year term as head of the federal law enforcement agency and was expected to step down in 2003.
He was the target of criticism following the arrest in February of Robert Hanssen, an FBI agent accused of working for Moscow for more than 15 years.
Achievements
Before taking office in January, President George W Bush had asked Mr Freeh to stay on as FBI chief.
In his statement, Mr Freeh thanked President Bush for keeping him on after Mr Clinton's departure.
He also listed FBI achievements under his direction including: forging a relationship with the CIA hiring several thousand new special agents doubling the agency's overseas presence gaining a bigger budget for crime-fighting He did not spell out his future plans but has previously expressed an interest in getting a higher-paying job outside government. Mr Freeh accepted his post as FBI director in 1993 after President Bill Clinton agreed to two requests - managerial independence and time for his family.
Differences
Despite the fact that he was appointed by President Clinton he often
clashed with the Clinton White House.
In 1996, he had differences with then-Attorney General Janet Reno over the government's investigation of alleged wrongdoing by Democrats in connection with campaign-funding activities. Mr Freeh grew up in New Jersey, with a boyhood dream of becoming an FBI agent. When he started working for the federal service he went undercover against organised crime on the waterfront.
In 1991, President George Bush appointed him as federal district judge in New York.

Ex-Mexico leader escapes charges
Prosecutors accused Echeverria of "harming humanity"
Mexico's Supreme Court has ruled that a former president accused of human rights abuses cannot be tried for an attack on students in 1971.
The court approved a 30-year time limit in the case, exempting Luis Echeverria from prosecution on genocide charges.
The decision is a setback for current Mexican leader Vicente Fox, who has pledged to punish human rights crimes. Hundreds died between 1970 and 1976 as Mr Echeverria's government ran a "dirty war" against leftists.
The court voted 4-1 in favour of applying the time limit on the crime, upholding a decision by a lower court.
Mr Echeverria, now 83, is the first former Mexican president to face the possibility of charges for human rights abuses allegedly committed during his time in power.
Students killed
Special prosecutor Ignacio Carrillo could decide to pursue further charges against Mr Echeverria.
The Supreme Court confirmed it would consider a series of other arguments put forward by Mr Carrillo.
Students were attacked and killed with sticks and guns in June 1971
According to Mr Carrillo, the former president ordered men loyal to the government to attack protesters during a student demonstration in June 1971.
Defence lawyers admit that 11 people died in the attack, although Mr Carrillo insists that up to 50 died in the "Corpus Christi massacre".
Mr Echeverria was accused of using a gang of armed government thugs, known as the "Halcones", or Falcons, to systematically attack enemies of the government during his time in office.
Ten other people, including former government members and five members of the Halcones, have been charged with involvement in the alleged attack.

China by region
China is just one country, but it stretches further than the distance of London to Cairo or Washington to Caracas. Although its 1.3bn people share a nationality, there are many issues specific to individual regions. Click on the map above to read more about what matters most in different places.
Beijing Area: 16,800 square kilometres
Population: 13.82 million
China's capital is an important shop window for the country, and a key target for protesters wanting to challenge the government. Corruption Beijing officials must tell their bosses if they plan to buy a home
Beijing city authorities have ordered all officials to declare personal information - such as whether they are building or buying homes, of if their children are going abroad to study - in a bid to rein in corruption.
The rules were reintroduced this year after a 20-year hiatus in the city, which is still said to be reeling from a scandal surrounding party boss and Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong who was jailed in 1998 for his part in a $27m scam.
Corruption in official circles is said to be one of the main concerns of Chinese citizens and, if unchecked, could produce more problems for the government and its credibility and support.
But with local officials' pay still said to be relatively meagre, correspondents say bribery is far from extinct in Beijing.
Corruption threat to Party
Chen Xitong, the corrupt comrade
Protests in Tiananmen Square
The 1989 protests and crackdown heralded new restrictions The vast expanse of Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing has long been central to Chinese symbolism - it was here that Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic and the square hosts displays for visiting dignitaries and national celebrations.
But the wide-open spaces are also seen as the best place by protesters wishing to challenge the rulers of the day. Since the 1989 killing of pro-democracy demonstrators, any activity in the area has been restricted.
But protesters such as followers of the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual sect continue to try and highlight their complaints in the square, ensuring that its importance as a symbol will continue.
Eyewitness: Falun Gong arrests
Neighbourhood redevelopment
Beijing is a city which is 800 years old, laid out on imperial lines with the Forbidden City at its centre. Ancient hutong courtyard homes are losing out to development
But the long march of progress into the 21st century is claiming old neighbourhoods as its victims, with the destruction of the ancient hutongs, the walled compounds once home to the city's elite.
After the Communists took power, families were crowded into the compounds which authorities now say need to be redeveloped for health reasons.
But the prime, central location of many of the hutongs leads sceptics to believe that their commercial value is more important.
But as one ancient Beijing feature is destroyed, another is reborn with the rebuilding of the medieval wall. Pulled down on the orders of Mao, it is now due to be recreated ahead of the 2008 Olympics.

North-East (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning)
Area: 786,000 square kilometres
Population: 106.55 million
Bitter north-eastern winters are good for ice sculptors but hard on villagers
China's north-eastern provinces were once the country's industrial heartland. But millions of factory workers are now unemployed as the state tries to reform its economy to compete in the world of free trade. The area's harsh climate helps provide one of its few tourist attractions with the annual ice festival in Harbin where temperatures of -30 C (-22 F) can guarantee to keep water sculptures frozen.
Labour unrest
Factory work is no longer as guaranteed as it seemed when this photo was taken in 1991
Unemployment has become a stark reality for residents in Liaoyang, Daqing and other industrial cities.
Millions of workers have lost their jobs in the last decade, especially in the industrial north-east, as the government has tried to reform loss-making state-owned enterprises.
In Liaoyang, residents claim half the workforce is unemployed. There have been street protests by workers demanding blocked redundancy payments and back-pay. Protest leaders have been detained indefinitely.
The Asian Development Bank predicted that China's industrial and services sector would be helped by China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, but added that would offer little comfort to the unemployed in the north-east's "rust belt".
The unemployment challenge
Pollution The heavy industrial past of the north-eastern provinces has taken a severe toll on their environment.
Factory waste dumped into the Liao River plus inadequate sewage systems meant that its water had become so polluted it could not be used for farming. Water-borne diseases were also prevalent around the river basin.
The World Bank has decided that cleaning up the environment around China's major river basins and, in particular, improving water quality should be a priority.
It has approved a $100m loan for projects in the area which it says will include education about water management as well as immediate clean-up action. Dust bowl
Drought and deforestation have helped to stir up dust storms
Officials are battling to stop the advance of a desert that has taken over large parts of north China and has now moved to within 250 kilometres of the capital, Beijing.
Sandstorms in 2002 have been particularly bad, worsened by winter droughts, deforestation and over-grazing. Tree-planting schemes have so far had made little impact on the progress of the dust created by 20 years of desertification.
The village of Longbaoshan has started to be swallowed up under the encroaching dust, forcing the village's farmers from their land.
Dust storms spread

Coastal strip (Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong)
Area: 438,000 square kilometres
Population: 192.5 million
From China's largest city of Shanghai down to its tropical tourist island of Hainan, the coastal strip has been transformed by the pursuit of wealth. Shanghai's landscape is dominated by skyscrapers. Paddy fields have been paved over as communities develop as near as they can to the boom areas of Hong Kong and Taiwan. But the residents of the coastal strip are finding that problems often accompany prosperity.
Private sector
Capitalist entrepreneurs can now join the Communist Party
Young Chinese entering the job market in the 21st century are more and more likely to find work in the private sector.
Figures collated by the Ministry of Labour showed that the private sector created 30% of new jobs in the first three months of 2002, and other statistics reveal that private firms now produce one-third of the country's GDP.
The richest people in China, who once would have had to fear for their lives, can now look forward to helping to set their country's agenda. President Jiang Zemin said last year the Communist Party would have to recruit capitalists and Guangdong made history in May by electing private business leaders to its decision-making congress.

Guangzhou's plans to rise again

Migrant workers
It is estimated there are 100 million illegal migrant workers in China
Booming growth in China's cities plus the perennial hard life in rural areas has led to tens of millions of people leaving their villages and heading for the urban streets which, if not paved with gold, seem to promise an easier and more profitable living.
Employers and city dwellers have seemed more than willing to use the cheap labour which pours off the cross-country trains every day, putting them to work on construction sites or as domestic helpers.
But migrant workers in China face special problems, since people can lose their rights to healthcare and schooling if they move out of their designated home area.
Workers on the move
Middle-classes
Middle-class children may have their own bedroom, a nanny and all the toys they want
China's middle-classes - once under threat of extinction by the Communist Party - are enjoying a renaissance.
In the affluent parts of cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou, newly wealthy families now have the flat, car and domestic servant their predecessors could never have known.
Many believe that China's entry into the World Trade Organisation will mean cheaper imports, more American films and opportunities to travel.
But psychologists warn that the new social mobility and freedoms available to the middle classes can bring their own problems. Self-help books are now a common sight in Shanghai bookshops.

Yangtze basin (Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi)
Area: 1.04 million square kilometres
Population: 366 million
The mighty Yangtze River - the longest in China - has been called the cradle of Chinese civilisation and remains a vital artery through the country. But even as ancient settlements in the vast flood plains disappear under planned reservoirs, the region continues to innovate in other areas.
Three Gorges dam Between one million and two million people will have to move
A Yangtze River cruise through the dramatic Three Gorges regions has been a highlight of many a tourist's trip, but for the people who live in the area, the river was often a beast rather than a beauty.
Generations have been plagued by its floods. Plans to try to tame the river have been around for more than eight decades.
But now that the project to dam the river and harness its power to produce electricity is well under way, those who live on the flood plains face new trials.
More than one million people will have to leave their homes by the time the dam is completed and a 600-kilometre long reservoir covers the Three Gorges. Critics say they are being forcibly resettled on poorer land.
China's costly dam project
Television revolution
TV viewers can now get soap operas and talk shows as well as propaganda
The millions of Chinese who sit down each evening to watch a bit of television are beginning to see something different on their screens.
While the government still runs the country's 1,500 or so TV stations, propaganda is no longer the main subject.
Hunan TV is one of the stations leading the way, producing variety shows that get huge audiences as well as attracting the advertising which is also become a more and more important part of the industry.
Its talk show - Take It Easy - would have been recognisable to American audiences with its discussion of divorce, adultery and teenagers. But the government showed it still maintained its right to intervene, and the series was cancelled - reportedly after officials were upset by features on homosexuality and China's growing wealth gap.
Media takes flight
Rural tax reform
Agricultural tax reforms have been welcomed in Anhui
Peasant farmers were once seen as model Chinese citizens, but their modern-day counterparts have found themselves victims of the system.
In Anhui province, officials collected agricultural taxes, education surcharges, village road maintenance fees, family planning fees and military training charges. "Taxes" were also invented for farmers doing such seemingly innocuous things as growing bananas or slaughtering a pig.
Now much of the antagonism generated by taxes has been abolished along with the taxes themselves as the authorities in Anhui try a new system whereby farmers pay far smaller set amounts and, instead of spending their time collecting tax after tax, officials work on improving the economy.
Greater subsidies are now being provided by the central authorities to pay for projects that used to be funded from the farmers' pockets. Rural tax revolution

Rice bowl (Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan) Area: 1.09 million square kilometres
Population: 171 million
With warm climates and sufficient rainfall, Sichuan, Yunnan and Guangxi are important agricultural areas, known as the "rice bowl" of China. Yunnan forms China's borders with Burma, Laos and Vietnam and falls into the Golden Triangle of drug production and trafficking.
Agricultural development
Farmers in Guangxi and elsewhere are still waiting for their incomes to rise
Premier Zhu Rongji used his National People's Congress press briefing earlier this year to apologise to China's 800 million farmers for failing them.
Improving agricultural methods and profitability has been a key plank of the political and economic agenda in China, particularly in the run-up to China's accession to the World Trade Organisation.
Many farms are still trapped not only with old cultivation methods but also with the wrong crops - continuing to grow the same things they were told to under the old collective systems rather than what markets demand.
But Mr Zhu promised that the reforms that he has put in place, such as cutting oversupply of land, would work and would lift rural workers' incomes while still feeding the massive population.

International drug trafficking Heroin from poppies grown in Burma is often trafficked through China
Thanks largely to its porous border with Burma and the Golden Triangle opium-producing region, south-western China has become an important part of the illegal drugs industry which harvests poppies in Burma, refines heroin and then distributes it around the world.
Beijing has been critical of what it saw as a lack of commitment on Rangoon's part to stop the production and distribution of illicit drugs. But from late 2001, the two countries agreed to share intelligence and the number of arrests and seizures increased.
But with production of opium poppies greatly affected by the war in Afghanistan, the Golden Triangle crop became the world's largest supply of heroin. Almost all of that crop still passes through China to be sold to local users or shipped around the world.

Internet use
Cyber cafes are popular with the young, but many people now have internet access at home The Chinese have become the second-largest web audience in the world, overtaking the Japanese, though still far behind the Americans.
While it would be a gross exaggeration to suggest that more than a fraction of Chinese people use the internet, its use has spread rapidly throughout the country.
The China Internet Network Information Centre said the number of internet users soared by 12 million people in the first six months of this year to reach 45.8 million users.
And though the majority of websites still come out of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, there are now more than 10,000 produced from Guangxi, Sichuan and Yunnan with 62% of Chinese users able to access the net from home.

Tibet
Area: 1.2 million square kilometres
Population: 2.6 million
Most of Tibet is situated on a plateau 5,000 metres above sea-level on the "roof of the world", bordered by the Himalayas in the south and the Kunlun ranges to the north. Though many Han Chinese have moved to Tibet, particularly the eastern part of the area, most inhabitants have a Mongolian ethnic background. The ethnic divide, mass support for Buddhism and other issues stemming from China's invasion of Tibet in 1950 and its bloody crackdown of an anti-government uprising in 1959 make Tibet one of China's most controversial regions.
Religion
Pictures of the Dalai Lama can only be kept secretly in Tibet
China's constitution proclaims freedom of religion. The state recognises that Buddhism is followed widely, most particularly in Tibet, the home of Lamaism - the form of Buddhism led by the Dalai Lama.
But the Dalai Lama has been in exile since 1959. Monks in Tibet loyal to him are not even allowed to display his picture. And there is an ongoing dispute over another spiritual leader, the Panchen Lama.
The six-year-old boy identified by the Dalai Lama in 1995 as the latest reincarnation of the Panchen Lama was rejected by Beijing, and Chinese officials took the boy into custody and picked a different youngster as the legitimate heir, causing lasting opposition and resentment among many Tibetans.
The role of the Panchen Lama is crucial in Tibetan Buddhism as it will be he who decides who will become Tibet's spiritual leader and the next Dalai Lama after the death of the incumbent, who is now 67; that is an issue that could again leave Tibet divided.

Assimilation
One of China's most controversial projects has been its plan to resettle tens of thousands of ethnically Han Chinese farmers in Tibet and on its borders.
Beijing won promises of at least $40m from the World Bank for the programme it described as helping some of its poorest people. But critics said it was an attempt to dilute the ethnically Tibetan and Mongolian peoples with Han Chinese who account for nearly 92 per cent of China's population.
The offer was withdrawn and China is now using internal funds to pay for the plan it says is supported by the traditional people in the area.
Exiled Tibetan groups continue to oppose the resettlements, saying they threaten traditional Tibetan language, culture and identity.
Development
A 37-storey tourist tower with revolving restaurant is set for Lhasa
Once one of the most inaccessible nations on earth, Tibet is being brought more and more into the modern world. In addition to the numbers of Han Chinese being moved into Tibet and the neighbouring province of Qinghai, a railway is being built to link Tibet to the main rail network. The face of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa is also changing.
Houses that used to nestle at the foot of the Potala Palace - the home of the Dalai Lama since the 7th century - were destroyed to create a huge plaza and monument.
A 37-storey tourist tower topped with a revolving restaurant has also been announced in what China says is part of a nationwide campaign to support Tibet's economic development. China's ambitious railway

North
(Qinghai, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei. Tianjin)
Area: 3.127 million square kilometres
Population: 390 million The vast north of China is relatively lightly populated, partly because of inhospitable terrain and a climate that makes only around 10% of the area possible to cultivate. Poverty has taken its toll, not just in terms of deprivation, but in the way farmers have felt driven to sell their blood or rush to dig the region's coal resources in dangerous and unregulated mines. The area's few cities do make their mark, with Xian's army of terracotta warriors set to attract record numbers of visitors while Tianjin remains a key military base and port.
Bad blood
The rampant spread of HIV across Henan is a grim portent of an Aids crisis poised to sweep China, a United Nations body has warned.
Farmers had been selling their blood to illegal blood banks and many became infected with HIV during the process.
By 2001, it was estimated that two-thirds of the Henan village of Wenlou were infected with the virus that can lead to Aids.
UN officials say HIV is still being spread through illegal blood sales as well as sex.
The UNAids agency says China's government is not doing enough to educate people to stop transmission. It predicts a possible 10 million cases in China by 2010.
China facing Aids 'time bomb'
Mine closures
The 10,000 miners ordered to pack their bags as their mines were being shut down could actually be seen as among the lucky ones in their industry, which claims that many lives in accidents every year.
Authorities regularly try to close down illegal mines and impose safety standards on the industry, but there is often huge pressure from workers and the authorities who want their share of the revenues the mines provide.
Correspondents say new illegal mines spring up as soon as others are shut down, with peasant farmers travelling long distances in the hope they can earn the lucrative wages unknown in their home villages.
The continuing supply of labour, and the continuing demand for the coal that supplies China with 70% of its energy, suggests the disasters will continue.
Miners told to pack bags
Deadly mining industry
Military The military influences politics and the economy as well as the country's defence
Tianjin is home to one of the largest garrisons of the People's Liberation Army and has been used as a showcase to foreign media on the military's modernisation efforts.
President Jiang Zemin ordered that the PLA cut back on its vast economic empire which laid the army open to charges of corruption or caring more about business than defence.
In Tianjin, the PLA handed over control of a mobile phone network it had run to a private company.
Tianjin was also believed to be the first garrison to hold civil trials in its military courts - another part of the modernisation ordered by central government to ensure that the army also abided by the country's laws and that disputes with civilians were handled properly.

Xinjiang
Area: 1.6 million square kilometres
Population: 19.25 million
Xinjiang is enclosed by mountain ranges to the north, south and west. Much of the province is barren - there are large grazing lands, but also a vast desert and the Lop Nur dried-up salt lake which China uses for its nuclear test explosions. The mainly Muslim Uighur people now make up around half of the population, which endures extremes of heat in the summer and cold in the winter. Once on the Silk Road trading route, there are now moves to revitalise the area.
Ethnic minorities
The Uighur ethnic minority used to be in the majority in Xinjiang
Students entering Xinjiang University from this September will no longer be able to choose to take their studies in Uighur language.
More than half of Xinjiang's population is from the Muslim Uighur ethnic minority and they had been allowed to study in their native tongue since the People's Republic was founded.
Some Uighurs say that the crackdown on their language - explained by the university as a need to raise standards - is part of Beijing's broader campaign against dissent and separatism.
They say that Xinjiang is the "other Tibet" and that their separate identity, language and culture are under threat.
In a break with the past, the central government has raised the issue of separatist violence in Xinjiang, denouncing some activists as being linked to Osama Bin Laden and pledging to stop their activities.
Language blow
China's fearful minority
Executions
The death penalty is now aimed at separatists as well as drug criminals, Amnesty says
China has long been the world's leading executioner. The human rights group Amnesty says China executes more people each year than the rest of the world put together.
China's "Strike Hard" campaign promises harsh penalties for those involved in crimes such as drug trafficking. It has also been used to deal with separatists in areas such as Xinjiang, Amnesty says.
There are several reports each year of Xinjiang separatists being executed for their activities, but the human rights group said in July 2002 that authorities had extended the range of the "Strike Hard" mission to target people involved in "illegal religious activities" in Xinjiang.

They want the same living standards and opportunities in provinces such as Xinjiang as are available in the wealthy coastal cities.

Mystery of missing Thai Silk King
By Jonathan Kent
BBC News, Kuala Lumpur
It was an Easter Sunday on 26 March 1967. At around 3pm that day Jim Thompson, already well known as the "Thai Silk King", walked out of Moonlight Cottage where he was holidaying with friends in Malaysia's Cameron Highlands and was never seen again. Jim Thompson walked out of this cottage never to return
It was not simply Thompson's fame and wealth that guaranteed his disappearance would become one of South East Asia's greatest modern mysteries - it was his past. He had spent World War II with the OSS, the US intelligence agency that was the precursor to the CIA. After the war he settled in Bangkok and in 1948 started the Thai Silk Company. In doing so Thompson played a pivotal role in reviving the Thai silk industry. He introduced modern dyes, better looms and oversaw production and marketing while allowing his weavers, most of them women, to work from home and share in the company's profits. It made Thompson a millionaire.
I've never accepted the theory that he could have been lost in the jungle
Tristan RussellTea plantation owner
But it was also rumoured that Thompson maintained his links with American intelligence. So when he vanished it was front page news and the theories about his disappearance started to multiply.
"I got a call from a friend that an American millionaire was missing, jungle walking," remembers Chou Chuan Sheng, who at the time managed a local hotel and acted as a Cameron Highlands stringer for much of the Malaysian press. "I got all the story from Jim Thompson's close friend, Mr TG Ling, Mrs Ling and Mr Thompson's friend Mrs Mangskau." The Lings owned Moonlight cottage and Mrs Mangskau had travelled to the Highlands as Thompson's companion. For the first couple of days Mr Chou had unimpeded access to the group.
Jim Thompson was a well-known figure across South East Asia
"Thompson went for a walk that Sunday alone without telling anybody. Dr Ling, from his room adjacent to the hall, could hear footsteps and he took it that it was Thompson's footsteps and that he went out for a walk." He was expected to return for tea but when he failed to appear Dr Ling went to the police station at the nearby town of Tanah Rata that evening and reported Thompson missing.
But then the security net closed around Thompson's friends, and reporters were prevented from speaking to them. Meanwhile, the search was stepped up with British troops and two Royal Army Air Corps helicopters joining their Malaysian colleagues. Brigadier General Edwin Black, a long-standing friend of Thompson's and commander of US support forces in Thailand flew in to assist, as did some of his senior colleagues. Conspiracy theories
This was the 1960s in South East Asia. Vietnam was 10 months away from the Tet Offensive and while the Communist Party of Malaya had been driven north over the Thai border its reach still extended to the Cameron Highlands.
The most common rumour up here is that he was abducted, but I've come across a couple of other stories
Phil RiversFormer Malayan police officer
Despite there being a manhunt on an unprecedented scale, with 400 or more people involved in the search, no trace of Thompson was found. The official explanation was that Thompson had probably become lost in the jungle or had fallen down a ravine while out walking. Tristan Russell, whose family has run tea plantations in the Cameron Highlands since the 1930s, does not believe it.
"He apparently only went for a short walk. There's no deep jungle there so how one could be lost in the jungle and not be found I can't see. I've never accepted the theory that he could have been lost in the jungle."
As the days and weeks passed the search began to attract rather more unorthodox helpers, including Malay bomoh (traditional magicians) and Chinese mystics.
"In Malaysia we have these temple medium people and they claimed they could tell where Thompson was," Mr Chou recalls. "Because of the reward for Thompson alive or dead, four or five of these temple mediums formed themselves into a band with cymbals, drums and so on and went into the jungle. But they didn't reappear so the police had to send people to rescue them."
Then there was Peter Hurkos, a renowned TV "psychic" and entertainer, who was accompanied to Malaysia by Lt Denis Horgan, a member of Brig Gen Black's staff.
His explanation fell into the group of theories that stemmed from the belief that Thompson was working for the CIA. "He has been abducted to another country but is not being held for ransom," Hurkos told Mr Chou at the time. "I stake my neck on this." Hurkos claimed he "saw" 14 men in dark green uniforms; Communists, abducting Thompson and bundling him into an army truck. Malaysia's Cameron Highlands is a popular tourist spot
Others claimed that he had staged his own disappearance possibly because he feared being exposed as either gay or as a double agent.
Phil Rivers, a former officer in the Malayan police and a long-time resident of the Cameron Highlands, says the conspiracy theories became more and more outlandish. "They had convoys of Thai cars racing up and down the hills, they had mysterious strangers showing up saying they'd been told he was hidden nearby in a bungalow, or in a cave or he was on top of a mountain somewhere."
There were further theories that Thompson had been taken by a tiger. Some believed he had fallen into an animal pit dug by the indigenous people of the area, known generically as orang asli. Mr Rivers thinks his end may have been rather more mundane.
"The most common rumour up here is that he was abducted, but I've come across a couple of other stories. "One of them is that he was knocked down by a timber lorry and that his body was taken away and run through a buzz saw and another one is that he was knocked down by another chap who was doing some work locally and was buried." Mr Rivers says he is investigating reports that a local man made a deathbed confession to this effect.
Forty years on and the mystery of Thompson's disappearance seems no closer to being solved than it ever was. However the Thai Silk King's name lives on - used by silk shops and restaurants and in the annals of modern Asian mystery.

Business: The Economy
The EU budget deal
Germany's Gerhard Schrï¿½der and Joschka Fischer produced a result
The EU budget compromise reached in Berlin is an intricate numbers game, hammered out in 20 hours of non-stop talks.
The reforms are not as radical as many politicians had called for. Several countries fought hard to protect their share of EU money and, as all budget decisions have to be unanimous, they could have vetoed any deal going against them.
In typical EU fashion, the compromise budget is mixture of give and take, but there are some clear winners and losers.
As the sun rose over Berlin, a compromise was finally foundMost consumers living in the European Union should be among the winners, as the price of many foods could fall in the coming years.
Spain, Greece, Portugal and France did quite nicely, defending their share of EU subsidies.
The big loser is Germany. The host government tried to get its EU payments reduced by 3bn euros, but for the talks to succeed the Germans had to settle for a cut of just 700m euros. Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands are the other big contributors to the EU's coffers and they did not achieve the big cuts they hoped for either.
Italy could soon become one of the big spenders. In two years new rules for calculating each country's budget share will sharply drive up the size of Italy's contributions. Money matters
The EU budget is not very large, weighing in at around 85bn euros (ï¿½60bn). Germany, for example, spends more on unemployment benefit every year.
Budget freeze
A special deal for Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok translates into a 1bn euro cut in net contributionsOne result of the Berlin summit is a freeze of the EU budget at 1999 levels. At the same time, EU leaders reconfirmed a budget "ceiling" - it cannot be larger than 1.27% of Gross National Product. This figure, though, has never been reached before.
Payments
More importantly, EU governments decided to change the way the level of contributions is calculated. Until now, payments to Brussels have been a proportion of each country's VAT revenue. In future the VAT-linked contributions will be replaced by money raised as a proportion of each country's Gross National Product. Economically successful EU members will have to pay more as they can afford more.
Rebate
The United Kingdom, meanwhile, has managed to defend its rebate - a discount on its budget contributions agreed in 1984. The costs of financing this will be redistributed among the other 14 members. Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden will have to pay less. The planned changes in calculating the EU budget contributions would have given the UK a rebate windfall, but the summit agreed that the UK would get no extra money. Agriculture
The farmers' hero, French President Jacques ChiracThe Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) eats up half of the European Union's budget. The main beneficiaries are countries with large agricultural sectors. France, for example, gets more than a fifth of all EU farm spending. The European Commission had proposed sharp cuts in farm subsidies, but France managed to fend off most of them.
Cereal subsidies will be cut in two steps by 15%. Beef prices will be reduced by 20% in three stages, but beef producers will receive direct aid to make up for 85% of their losses.
The most contentious area was dairy products. In a typical Euro fudge, leaders decided to delay the planned cuts of 15% until 2005.
Regional aid
When Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain joined the EU, they were economic have-nots. Massive money transfers from Brussels have boosted their economies, and Ireland has grown so rich that it has overtaken some of the established EU members in the wealth league tables.
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar avoided cuts in regional aidThe success of EU regional aid policy has not yet triggered an end to subsidies, but regional aid funds will be limited to 213bn euros over the next seven years. This is well below the amount demanded by Greece and Spain.
Some of the regions that have grown rich, for example parts of the Irish Republic and the region around the Portuguese capital Lisbon, will soon be dropped from the list of regions eligible for priority funding. But they will receive some money to help during the transition.
Extra money has been found for some other special cases like Northern Ireland, the Scottish Highlands and Islands, East Berlin and some barren regions of Sweden, which will get extra grants.

Past Nobel Literature winners
A quick guide to the previous eight winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature, which has been given out since 1901.
Doris Lessing, 2007
Orhan Pamuk, 2006
Harold Pinter, 2005
Elfriede Jelinek, 2004
JM Coetzee, 2003
Imre Kertesz, 2002
VS Naipaul, 2001 Gao Xingjian, 2000 DORIS LESSING, 2007 WINNER
Doris Lessing is a three-time Booker Prize nominee
Who: Novel and short story stalwart who has been one of Britain's most important writers during her 57-year career. Her work has encompassed everything from feminism, communism and colonialism to science fiction, thrillers and cats. At 88, she is the oldest person to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The judges on Lessing: An "epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny".
Lessing on Nobel: "It's about 40 years since they sent one of their minions especially to tell me they didn't like me at the Nobel Prize and I would never get it. I've never asked for it, you see, so this struck me as very bad manners. So now they've decided they're going to give it to me... do they like me any better?"
ORHAN PAMUK, 2006 WINNER
Orhan Pamuk has been famous in his native Turkey for decades
Who: Turkish author whose works, which include Snow and My Name Is Red, typically deal with clashes between civilisations and Islam's relationship with secular nationalism. In 2005, he was subject to a high-profile trial for insulting Turkish identity after discussing the deaths of Kurds and Armenians in Turkey. The charges were dropped.
The judges on Pamuk: "In the quest for the melancholic soul of his native city, [Pamuk] has discovered new symbols for the clash and interlacing of cultures."
Pamuk on Nobel: "I am very happy and honoured. I am very satisfied. I will try to recover from this shock. This will lead the world to review Turkish culture as a culture of peace."
HAROLD PINTER, 2005 WINNER
The playwright was diagnosed with cancer in 2002
Who: The controversial British playwright and campaigner, 76, has been writing plays for about 50 years. He is known for speaking out on issues like the war on Iraq. He is widely regarded as the UK's greatest living playwright.
The judges on Pinter:"[Pinter] who in his plays uncovers the precipice under everyday prattle and forces entry into oppression's closed rooms."
Pinter on Nobel: "I am both deeply engaged in art and deeply engaged in politics and sometimes those two meet and sometimes they don't. It's all going to be very interesting. I'm delighted at the news."
ELFRIEDE JELINEK, 2004 WINNER
Jelinek was the first Austrian writer to be honoured with the Nobel prize
Who: Austrian novelist and playwright is best known for her novel The Piano Teacher, which was made into a film by Michael Haneke in 2001. Jelinek, 59, was only the 10th woman to win the award. The judges on Jelinek: "For her musical flow of voices and counter-voices in novels and plays that with extraordinary linguistic zeal reveal the absurdity of society's cliches and their subjugating power."
Jelinek on Nobel: "Surprising and a great honour. It is the biggest honour." JM COETZEE, 2003 WINNER
He was the second South African to be awarded the Prize
Who: The South African writer is a solitary figure, who rarely communicates with the media and prefers doing so by e-mail. The 66-year-old has won the Booker Prize twice and has also won scooped the 2000 Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Disgrace. The judges on Coetzee: "[Coetzee] who in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider."
IMRE KERTESZ, 2002 WINNER
He wrote about the Holocaust because it had "no language"
Who: He is best known for works which draw from his experiences as a teenager in Nazi concentration camps. He has said himself, "When I am thinking about a new novel, I always think of Auschwitz." The Hungarian, who is of Jewish descent, was deported to Auschwitz in 1944. He was liberated in 1945 and started working for a Budapest newspaper before becoming a translator for German authors. The judges on Kertesz: "For writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history." Kertesz on Nobel: "My immediate reaction is one of great joy. It means very much to me. There is no awareness of the Holocaust in Hungary. People have not faced up to the Holocaust. I hope that in the light of this recognition, they will face up to it more than until now."
VS NAIPAUL, 2001 WINNER
Naipaul has been based in England since the 1950s
Who: A leading novelist of the English-speaking Caribbean, Naipaul, 74, writes about the cultural confusion of the Third World. He often draws on his own experiences too, such as feeling as an outsider, being an Indian in the West Indies, and a West Indian in England. The judges on Naipaul: "For having united perceptive narrative and incorruptible scrutiny in works that compel us to see the presence of suppressed histories."
Naipaul on Nobel: "I am utterly delighted, this is an unexpected accolade. It is a great tribute to England, my home, and to India, home of my ancestors and to the dedication and support of my agent Gillon Aitken." GAO XINGJIAN, 2000 WINNER
Xingjian paints and provides the cover illustrations for his own books
Who: Gao is the first Chinese writer to be awarded the prize. He is a political refugee and playwright whose works have not been performed in China since his play The Other Shore was banned in 1986. He left China in 1987 as a political refugee and has settled in the Paris suburb of Bagnolet. The judges on Gao: "For an oeuvre of universal validity, bitter insights and linguistic ingenuity, which has opened new paths for the Chinese novel and drama."
Gao on Nobel: He said he was "surprised and honoured by the distinction" but would not use his new-found name as a political forum to denounce China.

Mobile snaps reveal invisible art
By Mark Ward
Technology correspondent, BBC News website, San Diego
Invisible art works adorn buildings around Edinburgh
Scottish researchers are turning to camera phones to help bridge the virtual and real worlds.
Using image-matching algorithms the researchers have found a way to adorn the real world with digital content.
The technology has already been used to create a guide of Edinburgh that allows people to find virtual artworks placed around the city using their mobile.
Another related project uses the technology to automatically update a person's blog with their location.
"It's about using a camera phone as a magic wand," said Dr Mark Wright of the Division of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh who came up with the idea.
At the heart of Spellbinder, as the project is known, is a database of all the places that participants have added data to. People query it by taking a snap of a location with their phone then using multimedia text messages to send it to Spellbinder.
Dr Wright said powerful image-matching algorithms are used to analyse the image that can deal with snaps of the same place being taken under different lighting conditions or orientations.
Once Spellbinder has worked out the location of an image it consults the database and sends back an image with the extras added to it.
Virtual games
Previous projects to augment the real world with digital content used barcodes on objects or a software download that participants installed on their phones.
Gamers shoot snaps of the images on rival players' clothes
But barcodes required someone to go out labelling everything, Dr Wright said, and software can be hard to maintain and tweak for every possible handset that could use it.
The first use of the system has been in an Invisible Art project set in Edinburgh. This, said Dr Wright, encouraged people to explore the city and take snaps of landmarks to see whether others had added anything to them.
A game has also been developed using the system in which players wear a large individual image on their body and are given a "base" or location to protect.
Points are given for shooting snaps of the images on rival players' clothes or of their base.
Another project called Comera could be a boon to keen bloggers or users of social networking sites such as Facebook or MySpace as it consults the Spellbinder database to automatically update webpages with location data.
Although Spellbinder has been used to spot locations it could, said Dr Wright, be used to match almost anything.
"With Spellbinder, the real world becomes a computational resource," he said.
The project was unveiled at the Siggraph show held in San Diego, US from 5-9 August.

Monkey births celebrated at park
The baby snow monkeys are the first since the species were introduced
Two Japanese macaques are the first to be born at a Scottish wildlife park since the species' introduction to its collection in 2007.Aimi, the first to be born at the Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore in April, has been joined by another youngster in the past few days. Also known as snow monkeys, the animals' arrival at the park was followed by controversy last year. One escaped but was later recaptured shortly after three died. The escapee got out from its enclosure before being recaptured nearby within an hour. Earlier it emerged that a monkey was killed by a rival, while a second had to be put down and a third drowned. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which runs the site, said at the time that the deaths followed a struggle for dominance between the first group and a second, which was introduced later. Advocates for Animals said the incidents highlighted why it was inappropriate to keep wild animals in captive conditions. Polar bearMacaques were introduced after the park's collection was widened to include animals from mountain and tundra habitats from around the world. Last year, two Amur tigers were transported from Edinburgh Zoo to a new enclosure at the wildlife park. The pair named Yuri and Sasha had previously reared six cubs. Edinburgh Zoo has previously proposed moving its polar bear, Mercedes, to the Highland park.

1965: Students protest after Algiers coup
Police in the Algerian capital Algiers have broken up demonstrations by hundreds of people who have taken to the streets chanting slogans in support of deposed President Ben Bella. The protests began with an orderly march by students but police attempts to disperse the crowds turned them into rioting groups running through the streets. Ex-president Ahmed Ben Bella is being held prisoner in a remote Sahara outpost. He has been deposed by chief of the armed forces Colonel Houari Boumedienne and his National Revolutionary Council.
Communications cut off
In the early hours of yesterday morning, two tanks moved into position at the presidential villa in Algiers.
Police guards were quietly relieved by soldiers. There was a sound of breaking glass and a light was briefly seen before being turned off again.
By the time dawn broke, tanks had moved into various strategic points throughout the city, the airport was under military control and all communications with the outside world were cut off. After several hours of military music on the radio, Colonel Boumedienne broadcast a long statement accusing Ahmed Ben Bella of treason and promising him the "fate of all despots". The statement broadcast in the name of the Revolutionary Council also pledged to work for a "democratic, serious state" and the recovery of the economy.
One of the colonel's first actions has been to order the release of political prisoners held on "arbitrary" grounds. He has also given assurances no French people or property in the country will be harmed.
The coup has taken place 10 days ahead of an Afro-Asian Conference due to be held in Algiers. There is some speculation it may have been inspired by the Russians to prevent the meeting - from which they were excluded - from taking place. In Context
Ahmed Ben Bella was brought to power after leading the struggle for independence from France, which was finally achieved in July 1962. He was dependent on Colonel Boumedienne then chief of staff of Algeria's 60,000-strong army. He failed to build up a political force to act as a counterweight to the military and took control of many key ministries himself.
After the coup, he was held under house arrest for 15 years. On release, he lived in exile in Switzerland.
He continued to instigate unrest in Algeria and in 1990 returned to stand for the presidency at the head of the Mouvement Democratique Algerien (MDA). The 1991 election was won by an Islamist party but the result was annulled and Ben Bella was sent back into exile. The MDA was one of a number of parties banned in 1997. In December 1976, Colonel Boumedienne was elected president and served for two years until he died. Under the tight reins of his control, the country did begin to develop its oil resources and industrial sector.
Since his death, various attempts have been made to establish a multi-party democracy, but violence has continued between government and Islamic militants.
