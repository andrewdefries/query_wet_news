Protest rally over Qatar bombing
The attack was the first of its kind in Qatar
More than 1,000 people in Qatar have rallied in protest over a suicide car bombing that killed a Briton and injured 12 other people.
The bomb exploded outside a theatre near the capital, Doha, on Saturday.
Protesters rallying at the site of the explosion waved the national flag and held banners saying "No to Terrorism", while some said prayers. The Briton killed was teacher Jonathan Adams, in his 50s. The bomber was named as Egyptian Omar Ahmed Abdullah Ali.
A previously little-known militant group, Jund al-Sham, said on a website it carried out the attack, but this could not be immediately verified. Newspaper condemnation
The attack, the first of its kind in the Gulf state, came on the second anniversary of the US-led invasion of Iraq and has shocked Qatar.
It went dark, there was smoke everywhere, things were flying through the air - it was just pandemonium
Julie Hirst, who was in the theatre when the blast struck
'It was absolute chaos' In Pictures: Qatar bombing
Around 20 Western expatriates attended the protest, despite warnings from embassies not to gather in public. A friend of Mr Adams in Qatar, 56-year-old Nick Blessley, said he was protesting to express his anger at the bombing.
"I believe this is not the work of Qataris," he said.
Hassan al-Kindi, a 60-year-old Doha businessman at the rally, said: "We are very angry with what is happened in our country and we will back our government in every way to make sure none of this will ever happen again."
Around 50 heavily armed paratroopers surrounded the devastated theatre where the protest was held.
The Qatar government urged citizens and expatriates to join the "Rally of Indignation" beginning in the Halifax district, where the attack took place.
'Brotherly state'
Newspapers in Qatar have printed pictures of the victim and bomber, offering consolations to Mr Adams' family and condemning the attack.
Egypt's embassy added to the condemnations. Charge d'affaires Yasser Elshawaf said: "We strongly denounce such terrorist acts. We hope that this act will not affect the stability of Qatar, because Qatar is a brotherly state."
Omar Ahmed Abdullah Ali worked at Qatar Petroleum
Sheikh Yussef al-Qaradawi, an influential Egyptian-born hardline Muslim scholar based in Qatar, said such attacks were "not permitted either by religion or norms".
Mr Adams, originally from Dorset, had been in Qatar for about two years, media reports said.
He had left his seat alongside wife Rosemarie to investigate a noise at the back of the auditorium and took the full force of the explosion.
At the time about 100 people were in the theatre, which is situated close to a British school.
In its website claim, the Jund al-Sham said one of its "lions" carried out the attack and promised a full statement later.
'New baby'
The bomber named by Qatari authorities has been confirmed as an employee of the state-run Qatar Petroleum.
He had worked as a computer programmer there for about 10 years.
Such criminal actions targeting innocent people... are the work of a deviant and deluded group
Al-Watan newspaper
Your views: 'A serious shock'
One colleague told the Reuters news agency: "Nobody expected this from him. He was a decent man and just had a baby a month ago."
A team of French experts has reportedly arrived in Doha to help in the investigation, which will include checking possible links between the bomber and the al-Qaeda organisation. The Metropolitan Police has also confirmed that officers from its anti-terrorist unit are assisting the investigation in Qatar at the request of the local authorities.
Western embassies had said they believed the threat from terrorism in Qatar, which hosts the US military's Central Command, was high.
Last Thursday, al-Qaeda's Saudi boss, Saleh al-Oufi, used an Islamist website to urge attacks on "crusader" enemies in Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.

Pub offers punters 'honesty' pint
Customers can pull their own pint when the bar is busy
A pub in East Sussex has set up an honesty box system to allow drinkers to serve themselves.
The "novelty" taps at the Wheatsheaf Inn in Willingdon, near Eastbourne have been built by landlord Martin Hughes.
Customers are instructed to collect a glass from the bar before pulling their own �2.70 pint of real ale and put their money in an honesty box.
Mr Hughes said he trusted his regulars "absolutely" to pay for all the beer they drink.
He said: "It's good quality beer and it's served well but we've had to instruct people a little bit. They were a bit reticent at first, but they are getting used to it and loving it.
"It has a practical advantage as well. When the bar is busy they can come down here and help themselves."
Customers said they welcomed the new self-service unit, but complained it did not offer change.
Mr Hughes added: "We absolutely trust our regulars and we like to think they might be putting in a bit more.
"It's a novelty really. It's just to add a bit of interest in the pub and it's certainly done that."

SNP and Labour clash over TV election debates
Each leader will get a chance to speak first in a debate
The SNP and Labour have clashed over the rules for live prime ministerial debates in the run-up to the election.The Nationalists said the BBC has unfairly excluded the party, which forms the Scottish government. BBC, ITV and Sky and the three main UK political parties have now agreed the rules for the live debates. The SNP has not ruled out the threat of legal action over the issue, but Labour said SNP leader Alex Salmond was not standing for prime minister. The three 90-minute debates, featuring Labour's Gordon Brown, Tory David Cameron and Lib Dem Nick Clegg, will begin by focusing on domestic policies, international affairs and the economy. Party exposureStudio audiences will then be able to ask direct questions on any subject, with viewers doing the same via e-mail. The BBC will hold separate party leader election debates in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and other parties will be able to respond to the debates during subsequent news programmes. SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said his party was looking at "all the options" to address its concerns, but told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme it would not try to prevent the debates from going ahead. He said it was unacceptable for the licence fee-funded BBC to exclude Scotland's most popular political party from the leader debates. "This is a matter of basic fairness in the run up to a general election and the BBC has decided to give an hour-and-a-half of exposure to the leaders of the three UK political parties each in the run up to the election - and has made not a single proposal to give balance to the SNP in the run-up to polling day," he said. But former Scotland office minister David Cairns dismissed the SNP's concerns. He said: "I can't think of a single election anywhere in the world at any time where somebody who wasn't even a candidate in that election actually wanted to take part in a live televised debate - Alex Salmond is not standing for this election in Westminster." The Labour MP added: "In the UK parliament, which has got 650 seats, the SNP hold seven. In the UK parliament, the SNP are a fringe, minority party."

Natalie Portman talks to Newsround
Updated 09 May 2002, 17.22
Natalie Portman talks to Newsround about her role as Senator Padme Amidala in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.
Q: You've got one of the most important roles in the film and you're still quite young, what was it like playing such an important role that was so really action-packed?
Natalie: It's really exciting getting so much to do as a young person, especially to be a leader as a young woman. We rarely see that in the real world or in film. To get a girl who is in charge and taking care of business and not needing to be saved by anyone is pretty exciting.
Q: You started out acting really young as well. What's it been like for you?
Natalie: It's been such a wonderful experience, I really, really love acting. I think it can be a really great experience for kids to be involved in, as long as they don't get too wrapped up in the false aspects of the film industry.
Q: Everyone's probably asked you about George Lucas and what he's like as a director. What was he like with you, did he give you tips?
Natalie: It was really wonderful. George really has this vision and that's the most important thing for a film - to have a director who knows what he wants his film to be. The film is just amazing looking and has such a great story. It really captures your attention the entire time. He has a really clear idea about what he wants and that's what matters.
Q: As you are so young, what is it like signing up for a film that's going to take up the best part of 10 years of your life. Is that a big commitment to make?
Natalie: It is definitely a big commitment to make. I signed on for these films when I was 14 and I'm going to be done with them when I'm 23 I think. It's been a very, very, long ride. But it has been an incredible part of my life. I've had really interesting experiences and I've got to travel a lot and meet really cool people.
Q: So what about the role itself. Star Wars is a phenomenon, why did you choose this role?
Natalie: I was really excited to be able to be part of something that is a cultural phenomenon. It's a pretty great opportunity to be a part of something that so many people care so much about. And also to play a young queen and a young senator, that's not something you get a chance to do very often in Hollywood, you usually have to play someone's girlfriend. As a young woman to play this role was really exciting.
Q: What about the costumes? Were they better, more comfortable this time?
Natalie: The costumes were definitely more comfortable, which was really nice because I got to relax a little. That helps her fall in love, partly because she doesn't have to be this rigid queen character this time.
Q: I've got to ask you this, you're beautiful, you're young, you're bright, you go to Harvard (a top American university) and you're a successful actress, what ARE your faults?
Natalie: There's plenty, I don't want to give them all away because I want people to like me. I have issues like everyone else, my skins breaks out and I have many insecurities, and I'm impulsive often. There's things about me which aren't great. I hope my flaws don't overwhelm my assets. I try and do my best.
