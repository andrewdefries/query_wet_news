Rare inverted stamps fetch $2.7m
The stamps were sold before the error was spotted
A block of stamps that were mistakenly printed with the illustration upside down have been sold for $2.7m (�1.52m).
The sum paid at auction for the stamps, which date from 1918, is the largest amount ever paid for US stamps.
The stamps bear a picture of a Curtiss JN-4 plane, known as a Jenny, which was used for training pilots in World War I and later became an airmail plane.
About 700 of the erroneous stamps, now called an Inverted Jenny, were printed but only 100 went on sale.
Anonymous buyer
Once the mistake was spotted by postal inspectors the rest were withdrawn from sale.
The entire page of 100 stamps that did go on sale was snapped up by stamp collector William Robey in 1918 at a post office in Washington DC.
It was later broken up into smaller blocks and individual stamps to be resold.
The block of four, which was bought by an anonymous buyer on Wednesday, is the only one in existence that shows the printing plate's number upside down and in the stamps' margin, Scott Trepel, president of Siegel Auction Galleries, said.

Leading Farc commander surrenders
Karina (left) surrendered in the face of relentless army offensives
A leading commander of the Farc rebels in Colombia has surrendered to the authorities, officials say. Nelly Avila Moreno, known as Karina, was blamed for a string of murders and abductions, and for extortion in the north-western Antioquia region.
Her surrender is a coup for President Alvaro Uribe who made her a priority target for the security forces in 2002, the BBC's Jeremy McDermott says.
Farc has been fighting to overthrow the government for more than 40 years.
Karina was "nearly dying of hunger" when she and another guerrilla, known as Michin, handed themselves in, Colombian Defence Minister Juan Manuel Santos said. "We have been after this woman who did such damage to Antioquia and the whole region of Uraba for a long time," Mr Santos told RCN Radio.
$800,000 reward
Karina, who is in her 40s, had a fearsome reputation in Antioquia, and many businessmen and ranchers suffered extortion, kidnapping and murder at her hands, our correspondent says.
None doubted her fighting prowess and she has the wounds to prove it: she has lost an eye in combat, has scars across her face and a bullet wound on one of her arms.
In 2002, a reward of more than $800,000 (�409,000) was placed on her head. Our correspondent says Karina was an example to the women in the rebel army, who make up more than a third of the ranks of Farc, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. Her immediate boss Ivan Rios, a member of the Farc ruling seven-man secretariat, was murdered in March by one of his bodyguards. The bodyguard chopped off Rios's hand in order to prove to the authorities he had killed the commander and so collected a reward in excess of $1m. Since then, Karina has been in sole command of the Farc division in Antioquia.
Colombian media reports say in the wake of Rios's killing, this division began to disintegrate and faced a sustained army offensive. Two weeks ago, President Uribe sent a public message to Karina in which he guaranteed her safety if she handed herself in. The governor of Antioquia, Luis Alfredo Ramos, was quoted by local media as saying that Karina's family had also urged her to surrender.

Government bails out Connex
Connex says it cannot afford to carry on operating
The government is stepping in to pay �58m to a private rail company that has said it may be unable to continue running services in the long term. This package has short and long-term benefits for passengers
Nick Newton, SRA chief operating officer
The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has announced that it is bailing out the Connex South Eastern train company which runs services between London and Kent and Sussex.
Connex is said to be making enormous losses and executives now say they cannot continue to operate while losing so much money. The firm's franchise will now finish at the end of 2006 rather than in 2011.
Kent franchise
The government's rail authority will pay the money to keep the company going for another year.
But it is planning to renegotiate the franchise to ensure that promised new trains are delivered before 2006. Eventually a new franchise will be advertised and will include local services on the high speed line to the channel tunnel, which is currently under construction. "This package has short and long-term benefits for passengers," said Nick Newton, the SRA's chief operating officer.
"It secures the continuation of Connex's efforts to improve punctuality, ensures delivery of the programme to replace slam door trains, and opens the way for an expanded Kent franchise from 2007 incorporating the proposed high speed services."
Restoring stability
Critics of the government have said the bail-out is further demonstration that the government will always rescue privatised train operators, rather than letting them go bust.
More than half the 25 train companies have now received extra public money as part of refinancing or restructuring deals.
But an SRA spokesman defended the bail-out.
"Connex had been losing money and was likely to have continued to do so," he said.
"We wanted to have a degree of stability and that's why we have announced the extra subsidy."
Connex is a French-owned private rail firm which runs services throughout Europe.
It was originally awarded both the south central and south eastern franchises, but lost the south central franchise in October 2000 following criticism of its management and performance.

Depression heart research launched
The study hopes to unravel the link between stress and heart disease
Scientists believe that being depressed makes you more likely to suffer heart disease - and a new project is trying to find out why.
The British Heart Foundation is funding an investigation looking at how depression and stress could damage blood vessels.
Every year, tens of thousands of people in the UK are diagnosed with some form of coronary heart disease - it remains the biggest killer.
It happens when deposits gather on the sides of the arteries supplying the heart muscle, which eventually narrow and constrict blood flow.
Experts still do not know which external and internal factors cause the deposits to form and cause this hardening of the arteries.
Researchers think that long-term stress may be causing an "over-reaction" by the body's immune system, which causes inflammation in the tissues, which can cause long-term damage.
We believe that being depressed may lead to prolonged over-activity of the body's 'stress response'
Professor Michael Frenneaux
A team at the University of Wales College of Medicine in Cardiff is looking into the theory that the body's inability to deal with stress may contribute to this problem.
Professor Michael Frenneaux, who is leading the research, said: "When the body is under stress it produces certain chemicals that, over time, may be harmful to our arteries by causing inflammation.
"We believe that being depressed may lead to prolonged over-activity of the body's 'stress response' and this could be why depression can increase the risk of coronary heart disease."
The experiment will involve volunteers taking a drug which blocks the chemicals normally involved in the stress response.
The team is hoping that this drug will improve artery function.
Greater risk
The British Heart Foundation's regional director for Wales, David Napier, said: "Stress in short bursts is not harmful for the heart, and is a natural part of everyday life.
"However, long term stress or depression is a different matter.
"BHF statistics show that people show that people with less control over their work, and those who are depressed or have an angry personality are at a greater risk of coronary heart disease."
It is estimated that 12% of the population suffers from depression in some form.

Who's who in the Scottish Cabinet
Jack McConnell has announced his ministerial team
First Minister Jack McConnell has announced the ministerial team for the Scottish Parliament.
News Online looks at the senior cabinet members in the new-look Scottish Executive.
Jack McConnell was elected first minister by a majority of MSPs last week and sworn in as first minister on Tuesday.
The Motherwell and Wishaw MSP served as finance minister and then education minister before his elevation in the wake of former first minister Henry McLeish's resignation.
As education minister, Mr McConnell faced a stiff test in the last 12 months in getting Scotland's exams system running efficiently again after a fiasco in the summer of 2000. He also successfully steered his department through controversy over teachers' pay.
He is a former general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party and co-ordinated Labour's Yes Yes devolution referendum campaign. Jim Wallace is leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats and deputy first minister in the coalition administration.
The Orkney MSP is also the Scottish Executive justice minister.
Mr Wallace has stepped in as acting first minister pending the successors to the late Donald Dewar and most recent incumbent Henry McLeish and has won praise for his handling of the role.
He was elected leader of the Scottish Lib Dems in 1992 and served as MP for Orkney and Shetland from 1983.
A qualified QC, he decided to pursue his political career in the new Scottish Parliament in 1999.
Cathy Jamieson is elevated to the role of education minister in Jack McConnell's cabinet.
She takes on one of the most distinguished and toughest jobs in the cabinet.
The Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley MSP is viewed as a McConnell loyalist and is deputy leader of the Scottish Labour Party.
A graduate in fine art and social work, she started off as an art therapist and had a particular interest in working with young people at risk.
Mrs Jamieson was formerly principal of the Who Cares? Scotland organisation, working for young people in care and was elected to the Scottish Parliament in 1999. Malcolm Chisholm takes over as health minister, replacing Susan Deacon.
Mr Chisholm, the Labour MSP for Edinburgh North and Leith, had until Tuesday served as the deputy minister for health and community care.
The former teacher is another politician who gave up his seat at Westminster to serve in the Scottish Parliament.
He had served as a junior Scottish Office minister after the 1997 general election but resigned shortly afterwards in a row over payments to single parent families.
Mr Chisholm had considered standing for the partly leadership but decided against it, despite indications that he would have had a respectable following.
Wendy Alexander remains as the minister for enterprise and lifelong learning and takes on responsibility for transport.
Ms Alexander has been a minister since the formation of the executive in 1999, and originally held the position of minister for social inclusion, local government and housing.
The Paisley North MSP has been regarded as a protege of the late first minister Donald Dewar and a possible future Scottish leader.
Much attention was focused on Ms Alexander ahead of the reshuffle amid speculation that Mr McConnell had wanted to split the enterprise and lifelong learning portfolios.
The pair held talks at the weekend and Ms Alexander was successful in opposing the move. She takes on Sarah Boyack's transport portfolio.
Ross Finnie is another member of the Scottish cabinet to remain in post and maintain his portfolio as minister for rural affairs and the environment.
The Liberal Democrat list MSP for the West of Scotland has faced a tough year in which Scottish farming has been ravaged by foot-and-mouth disease.
He has seen exports of Scottish beef and lamb finally restored after months in which many farmers saw their businesses decimated.
Mr Finnie was chairman of the Scottish Liberal Party from 1982 to 1986 and spearheaded the Scottish Liberal Democrats' general election campaign from 1995 to 1997. He has been in the Scottish cabinet since 1999.
Andy Kerr is a new face in the Scottish cabinet and replaces Angus MacKay as minister for finance and public services.
A McConnell loyalist, it was always expected that the East Kilbride MSP would find a position within 'team McConnell'.
He was convener of the transport and environment committee in the parliament.
Mr Kerr formerly worked in Glasgow Council's land services department and was UK secretary of the National Association of Direct Labour Organisations between 1991 and 1992 and Scottish secretary from 1994 until 1997.
He then became advisor to the then Glasgow City Council leader Frank McAveety and was elected as an MSP in 1999.
Mike Watson was also hotly tipped to join the Scottish cabinet and joins as minister for tourism, culture and sport.
The Labour MSP for Glasgow Cathcart has, up until now, been best known for his bill proposing a ban on hunting with dogs.
Mr Watson was an adult education lecturer and a full-time trade union official before becoming Labour MP for Glasgow Central in June 1989.
He was re-elected in the 1992 general election but his constituency disappeared after boundary changes and there followed a bitter candidate selection contest with Mohammed Sarwar for the Glasgow Govan seat at the 1997 general election.
He eventually lost but was created a life peer as Lord Watson of Invergowrie before his return to elected politics in 1999.
Iain Gray has inherited the social justice portfolio from the outgoing Jackie Baillie.
Mr Gray takes a step up from his junior position as deputy minister for justice, where one of his responsibilities was to tackle Scotland's drugs problem.
He also served as deputy minister for community care until last year's reshuffle.
The former secondary school teacher and Oxfam worker was elected as MSP for Edinburgh Pentlands in 1999.
He has previously stood as a candidate in Lothian Regional Council elections.
Patricia Ferguson becomes the new minister with responsibility for parliamentary business, replacing Tom McCabe.
Mrs Ferguson had been appointed as one of two deputy presiding officers when the Scottish Parliament opened two years ago.
The Glasgow Maryhill MSP is a former NHS administrator, who also worked for the Scottish TUC and the Labour Party in Glasgow.
She was a key figure in Jack McConnell's leadership campaign.
She is a member of the procedures committee and the standards committee and
sits on a variety of cross-party groups including tobacco control and drug
misuse.
Colin Boyd QC remains as Scotland's lord advocate in the cabinet.
He has had a testing time since taking over from predecessor Lord Hardie as head of the prosecution service in Scotland.
Mr Boyd oversaw the conviction of one man for the Lockerbie bombing and conceded that the prosecution system failed the family of Asian waiter Surjit Singh Chhokar following two inquiries into his death.
He began as a solicitor in private practice before being called to the Scottish Bar in 1983.
Mr Boyd served as an advocate depute from 1993 to 1995 and took silk in 1995.
Elish Angiolini has made legal and political history by being recommended as Scotland's first woman Solicitor General.
Mrs Angiolini is also the first solicitor to be appointed to the post and the first person to be chosen from the Crown Office and the procurator fiscal service.
She has spent much of her career in the procurator fiscal service and until now has been the regional procurator fiscal based in Aberdeen for Grampian and the Highlands and Islands.
Mrs Angiolini will be responsible for the operational side of the Crown Office and the fiscal service.
She will also be responsible for complaints against police, and will chair a steering group on the prosecution of High Court cases set up as a result of the Campbell report on the Chhokar case. Full coverage

Cocaine: Alex James in Colombia, BBC One 8.30pm Monday 28 January
Thank you for sending us your views on Cocaine: Alex James in Colombia.

We have published a selection of your comments below.
Very disappointed with the lack of depth to the coverage of the civil war which is the underlying reason for the trouble surrounding cocaine in Columbia. The often refered to rebels are in fact the FARC, communist guerillas fighting against the corruption of a vicious capitalist class in Columbia. The current war followed a period where the FARC had established their own autonomous region, at this point the fighting had pretty much dissapated, that was untill under the guise of the war on drugs the US goverment entered the situation. Since then there has been an escalation in fighting and hand in hand with this an escalation in the cocaine trade as the guerillas need funds to fight the US led oppressors. The cocaine trade has corrupted many of the geurillas, but one has to recognise the guerillas fight as a legitamate one. So all the UK coke users please be proud - you are supporting the fight against US imperialism and world capitalism! Alex can't say how disappointed I am, I edso much more from a guy who has made some great and insightful music, your little love in with pesident Uribe was sickening. Perhaps you can go back and get the other side of the story. Neil Singh, Stoke-on-Trent
It was really interesting to see Colombia from a different perspective and we were really heartened by how Alex empathised with the Colombian people in the film. However what was a real shame was that there was nothing to show the human face of Colombians beyond the cocaine trade. Alex alluded to how great the country was but that was all - perhaps there is a chance to have a follow up programme where you can achieve a greater balance. We are not talking about a tourist guide to Colombia or anything trite like that but something that shows how drugs can affect the quality of everyday Colombians at work, in the schools etc. In some way that might have a greater impact on the consciences of drug users here than some of the scenes with the army and drug runners which is so alien to us. Thank you for taking the time though to bring Colombia's terrible problems to the attention of the UK public - maybe in the future, the BBC can do more to help in the ongoing battle against drugs and contribute in some small way to restoring peace in what is a very beautiful country which is full with wonderfully warm and intelligent people who are praying for change. Angela Gonzalez & Caroline Beard, London, UK
Alex forgot to say that farmers in Colombia go bankrupt because they can't compete with subsidized agro products imported from Europe and USA. They're left with only one profitable crop. Colombia imports corn from Iowa and exports coca to EU. Mr Duke, Kingston, UK

The fact that some of the people commenting on this programme mention the idea of legalising cocaine shows that the programme was not enough to portray all the issues behind the drug trafficking (i.e. killings, kidnappings, kids fighting in the war, etc.), and how it really affects us in ColOmbia (both O's by the way). However this is a really good initiative and BBC please keep these types of programmes coming! And so maybe the people here in Europe (and in America for that matter) can really understand one day, or at least can get a clearer picture of our problem and stop making jokes about Colombia and Cocaine and realise IT IS REALLY NOT FUNNY! Alejandra Ospina, London
Although it is a extremely sad situation I was very pleased to see a programme that showed how WE Colombians have to terribly suffer just so that a small group of people can have a little fun. I hope it reached some people and made them realise what a selfish thing to do taking cocaine is. Even if some people thought that Alex James and the Panorama team could have done a better job with the information and spelling I thank them and appreciate their effort to visit Colombia and expose some of the devastating consequences cocaine has and how ignorant people who take it really are. Diana, England
Columbian Policy on destroying the coca fields prevents those poor farmers from growing coca for all the plants' other uses, which are many.
Why not target the cocaine factories and destroy them rather than the growers. In any case 40-50% of all the coca used in Columbia for cocaine manufacture is grown in Peru.
Surely they would be better advised to follow this policy which is also advocated by President Morales in Bolivia.
Peter Freeman, High Peak, Derbyshire, UK
Thanks to BBC1 for broadcasting this programme.
Finally a documentary that identifies the real rout of the problem, which is the drug consumption in Europe and the US. If there wasn't a demand for cocaine, there wouldn't be a need to produce it and the Colombian farmers wouldn't be forced into growing it. The Colombian government and president Uribe in particular have been taking strict measures to deal with the drug problems in Colombia but the US and Europe have got to face up to their responsibilities and tackle drug consumption in their own country.
Shame though about the spelling mistake : ColUmbia is a film producing company & ColOmbia is a country.
Anne-Soazig Vesga, Warrington, Cheshire
I have never taken cocaine and can completely understand why they took the ex Blur star to present it. It stood out more than a normal presenter would have, and also would like to point out the murder rate in Colombia which included presenters. I think he was brave to go! One of my friends was shocked to see how the base was made and I am sure this has put her off the drug for life. It was so shocking that the bloke "Steve" was even contemplating being a mule again...it is a popular drug but it is a very dangerous one and one that does impact on others lives...the hitman in the taxi was killed and so was one of the soldiers who was pulling up the leaves to try to eradicate some of the crops. I know it will never eliminate the problem, but I hope it might have made some impact...I know I would never snort a white powder which started off being mixed with cement, petrol and sulphuric acid!!! Catherine, Reading, UK
Thank you panorama for bringing this to light. People are so worried about the life of a chicken that they go out of their way to buy free-range eggs or give up meat but when they are doing a quick line in the toilets they don't realize they are helping to put land-mines where a child could step on them and keeping some of the world's poorest people in poverty. lucie, barcelona
Having watched with interest the report by Alex James in Colombia and having read some of the comments posted by people since it was aired, I think that too many people are missing the point.
I feel that what he tried to do was entirely admirable, having been a user himself and having changed his ways. Who better to highlight some of the key issues relating to the "world's" cocaine problem? People at the end of the day make their own choices, but to make those choices with as much information as possible can't be a bad thing. I'm sure there were things that weren't covered in the 30 minute programme, but I feel he did cover a broad spectrum in the available time. My brother uses cocaine occasionally in the spirit of having a good time and when doing so turns into a slurring, dribbling mess totally unrecognisable to me. I hate it and don't understand his reasons for using the drug at all, but feel he does it because he see's it as more of a cool thing to do and that it gives him some sort of added confidence. Now I'm not naive enough to say this happens to everyone who takes cocaine, or that it couldn't be down to the amount of alcohol he consumes when he takes the drug. I do think that if he'd bothered to watch the programme he may well have had more of an insight into what his ten minutes of fun costs in real terms the next he's about to use. Alcohol, cigarettes, pornography, chocolate biscuits, whatever your poison is surely it's better to be well informed so that you can make the choice for you. But to pretend that bad things don't happen as a result of the cocaine business, to pretend that cocaine isn't glamorised in Britain, to pretend that lives aren't affected over here as well as in Colombia would be the biggest crime. Ben, United Kingdom
It strikes me that the loudest critics of this programme's intentions are the people who least want to accept the problems their dirty pleasure creates. I'd like to see the physiological effects of cocaine abuse addressed as they are also shocking. The problem is whilst it retains it's cache, people will keep on taking it. I wish more celebs would come out and say they don't do it, the trouble is they're too hard to find.
G. Darke, Bristol
It makes me very angry and sad when I see/read these kind of programs being shown about my country of origin - no wonder Colombia is only know for cocaine & violence. It makes me angry because the world forgets that it's not just a Colombian problem BUT a world problem. Let's not forget that the biggest consumers of this drug are the USA & Europe. The US can carry on pumping billions of US$ into Colombia to combat the drugs trade, but perhaps what they should do is pump this money into their society who obviously have serious addiction problems. The day people boycott this drug (like the world did back in the 60s & 70s) against the fur trade, that day Colombia will stop producing it. As long as Europe and the States keep demanding it the production will carry on. In the meantime my country and my people are being killed and massacred and destroyed, but no one cares about this as long as people abroad are having a "good time" at the expense of a nation and it's people!! It'! s time that the world also took responsibility for this problem - IT'S NOT JUST A COLOMBIAN PROBLEM, and if it wasn't for this "cancer" Colombia would be thriving and known for other things rather than this evil drug! Patricia, London, UK
Up until now I have always thought cocaine usage was unethical due to the supply chain issues including the misery endured by 'mules' and the associated violent crime. Should I ever consider using cocaine, this documentary made me feel much more comfortable to do so. Very little direct misery was shown and Alex James' presentation was self righteous, painfully slow in parts and overly emotive. He chose not to discuss a key issue with the president, which was to ask him his view on legalising the production, distribution and use of the drug in the same way that alcohol and nicotine are. He also did not point out the basic statistics that alcohol and nicotine are by far the biggest killers of all drugs used worldwide (from production to end user). An open, non moralistic debate on the legalisation or otherwise of cocaine is needed. Geraldine, London, UK
As a Colombian in London, I can say that it is the first time I've seen a professional article on Colombia and its cocaine problem. A programme that shows a reality without exploiting the sensationalism of the war and violence. I would like to thank the team of Panorama and Alex James who really transmit a non easy topic from a European point of view. Colombia is a very beautiful country full of wonderful things and marvellous people.
Alejandra Millan, London
Well at least the website is correct.... But the caption in the programme "President of Columbia" doesn't enhance my belief in your journalistic research. How many times.... if it's got a "u" in it it's in the USA.. Apart from that a good programme and may be one that has made people think a little.
Russell Turner,
nice idea at its root for a programme (middle class celeb going to see just what goes into the West's drug of choice)... but from the wrong spelling of "Columbia" at its start, to the rehashing of Colombia-stereotypes (life threatening situations wherever you travel) to Alex James actually heralding Uribe in his efforts (this a President whose history is so entrenched in Paramilitary activity & US collaboration his motives can never be seen as clear) this was no more than skimming the surface of what is a brutal situation. There is so much more to the Colombian drug problem than this mere 30 minute programme could surmise
David Hillson, London
Panorama is to be congratulated on commissioning such an innovative take on this issue. As someone who has travelled independently in Colombia and been bowled over by its natural beauty and its wonderful people, but also seen it so constricted by the drugs trade, it was really refreshing to see such a clear perspective come through from the programme makers. Let's hope that in some small way this programme has some influence on the future of a country that deserves so much better.
Steve Henderson, Beckenham, UK
The program was an appalling piece of propaganda where a (not so) "trendy" rock star was used to guilt-trip people who use cocaine. It completely failed to address the fact that all of the problems it exposed stem directly from the illegal status of the drug in question. The policy of international governments, in particular the United States with their pathetic "war on drugs" is to blame for the terrible state of affairs in Columbia. I hope I live to see the day when governments stop treating their citizens like children and allow them to choose what they put into their own bodies. Maybe one day I will be able to buy a couple of grams of fair-trade cocaine from my local pharmacy. I'd be happy, the Columbian farmer would be happy and the government would be happy with the tax levy. Makes a bit more sense, doesn't it?
Matthew, Bradford
I am a Colombian who has been living in London for the past 5 years. I work in the West End as a Rickshaw (Taxi bikes) rider and it is so annoying that people stigmatise you for being Colombian always asking for drugs. I am a professional in International Relations who came here to study and its frustrating to see how people think that taking drugs make them fashionable. The worse part of this, is that people judge you without the real knowledge of what is going on. There are millions of Colombians like me that have to carry with such as unfair reputation. Narcotrafic is a global problem, and it has to be treated in the same way. "There are two things infinite, the universe and the human stupidity, I am not sure about the universe". Albert Einsten
Ariel Echeverry, London
Even legalising production and taxation here of cocaine would help these problems. I do not promote nor use or intend to use cocaine, it IS dangerous and harmful, but the obvious benefits from legalising or removing the criminality associated with drugs and removing drugs from pushers hands and putting it into the governments or private companies is better than the existing policy. It is harmful, this cannot be denied, but surely legalisation is a better option, especially if its controlled, taxed and backed up by INFORMATION (this is key to keeping people off the stuff). The money is just going into the hands of criminals, it might be a drug, but the same way you make guns illegal you also make the people who carry them criminals, and put the same power into their hands that you do by prohibition of drugs, especially when drugs fuel organised crime, and probably indirectly kills more people than guns do!
Matt, Kent Canterbury
What a one sided argument, taken from the view of Politicians. Nothing shown of the beauty of the people and the place. I lived in Bogota for two years, never saw anything as depicted in your programme. No shootings, no stabbings. First day back in London and a street was closed after a stabbing. So inaccurate that when you showed President Uribe, said the "President of Columbia".. can't even spell the name of the country!!!! I am happily married to a Beautiful Colombian Lady living in one of the most dangerous places in the world... London.. and that is what I have seen from my own eyes. I felt much safer in Bogota than I ever do here!!!
Darrell Jones, London
Tonight's Panorama was a real eye-opener. I always had real misgivings about the whole drug debate but never had any concrete facts or evidence to back up my moral viewpoint. I hope many drug users will have seen Alex's brave and deep insights. The programme is real proof that no-one can use the argument 'if it isn't hurting anyone else, why not?'. Anne, London
Is this what Panorama has become, sending some inarticulate pop star to Columbia to tell us that drugs are bad and that soldiers being shot in coca fields is a long way from a jolly-up in Notting Hill? Tonight's show was insulting from start to finish, not to mention poorly shot (over exposed, out of focus...) Panorama used be about proper investigative journalism, now it's celebs on holiday.
Thomas Kelly, Dublin, Ireland
In two months of travelling throughout Colombia I've seen nothing of the problems shown in this feature, but I've seen their effects. These problems actually run much deeper than anything Alex talks about and much of it is rooted in government and military corruption as well as the farmers being under lethal threat by terrorist and paramilitary groups. The final result is a country stricken by poverty despite rich natural resources and a majority of intelligent and genuinely good people. The damaging and addictive effects of cocaine are overrated, but the inexplicably high value it has in the west gives power and motivation for a minority of corrupt or unfortunate individuals to keep Colombia in economical and social mayhem. Which is really a shame, since besides that it is by far the most amazing country that I've been to.
Eric, London, UK
The majority of drug trafficking is controlled by right wing paramilitaries who are linked to many of President Uribe's Government Officials and his friends. This 'open secret' is now well known. There are currently many senior officials awaiting trial. As hinted to on the programme the drugs problem could be eradicated overnight if the billions used to spray land was given to peasant farmers to plant alternative crops. The reason why non-coca crops are sprayed is to clear the land for exploitation of big business such as Coca-Cola. Anybody who dares to open their mouths in protest are often killed - more Trade Unionists are murdered than in any other country in the world, nearly half are teachers. Whilst all of this is clear for all to see the British Government still provides military aid to the murderous regime. Uribe has launched a charm offensive to convince the outside world he is fighting terrorism and drug trafficking when in fact he is responsible for ensuring the continuation of the slaughter, disappearance and displacement of countless people. Unfortunately Alex was taken in by Uribe and I would urge him to spend some time studying the mountain of evidence supplied by organisations such as Justice for Colombia (JfC). I guarantee he and other genuinely interested people will not fail to have their views changed as mine was when I went on a Trade Union and Solicitors delegation organised by JfC. Steve Jones, London
The Panorama franchise is a corpse now. Having just watched the Alex James episode I was stunned at how the BBC could offer this piece of risible, dumbed-down, 3rd rate so-called 'journalism' to the British public. The 6th-form idiots who wrote the programme couldn't even spell the name of Colombia properly. As a bellwether of the sad decline of the BBC generally the programme actually left me quite depressed at the thought of how little intelligent programming is available in the UK now. Panorama joins Horizon on the BBC's trash heap of once-great programmes. Andy, London
Saw the show. Seemed a bit political to me. Sure the trade exploits people but I'm sure if you showed farmers in Africa, South America etc, farming any crop or working for any multi national you could find things which are not ethical including child labour and violence etc. As long as people want stuff and they want it as cheap as possible unfortunately people will be exploited. Also I question the figure of 800000 users in the UK. I suspect it could be much higher than that as in my part of Leeds it is absolutely rife from everyone from the unemployed to the professionals.
James Mulkeen, Leeds UK
Congratulations. First time to see a TV programme treating this issue from this perspective, the real perspective of Colombian reality. Is good to create social responsibility abroad. Just to let know all the people in London that believe it is very posh and cool to sniff this, to be aware all the blood, tragedy and bad energy that has to pass by, so they can have some in their pocket, or in their nose.
Again congratulations and thank you for this great programme!!!
Carolina, Colombian living in London
Good to see a new angle on the cocaine wars, what Alex, didn't see, was the coca plantations in the paramilitary controlled lands in Colombia, lands that have been taken by force, causing more than 3 million internal refugees. The paramilitary coca plantations are never sprayed by the Colombian government which only wages war on the peasants that are not protected by their political and commercial allies, the paramilitaries. its understandable that Uribe Velez, who blinks when he sells his "truth" would not have shown the other side of the cocaine trade, the program is a step in the right direction ,there is more to see ,if the BBC. so wish.
Juan Guanus, Edinburgh UK
I was pleased to see that the BBC was airing on prime time TV a piece on Colombia which demonstrated the positive steps the country is taking against drug trafficking. There are too many misconceptions about the Colombia and I thought that the Panorama programme would be thought provoking and would educate viewers on this amazing country. However, I was angry that all this was negated as when the Panorama failed to spell Colombia correctly. Throughout the programme the typed text referred to 'Columbia'. For me the whole kudos and trust in the programme was lost by this simple error. How can we take seriously a programme if they can even get the name of the country right?
Katherine Saunders, London
Legalise Cannabis and save the beautiful country of Colombia. It is only the high price of prohibition that fuels the cocaine mafia. We in the West need to learn how to consume our drugs in a responsible way, as we do with alcohol. We should not transport our problems to Colombia as we are doing now by giving them our problems through irrational criminalisation. Martin Earl, London
Good 30 mins of insight. A real eye opener. You can get 5g for �100 here, it's rife in the whole city. If you want coke you can get it anywhere anytime. Someone always knows a guy that sells it. Its made me think what role I have in the bigger picture, and I definitely feel guilt..... Bring back Blur!!!!!
Craig, Glasgow, Scotland
I really enjoyed last nights program. However for something that has such a big impact on our current society I felt 30 minutes was not long enough. I have seen the devastating effect cocaine has on people and society. I feel that the battle against cocaine will never be won unless Colombia is given more resources to combat the problem from other governments other than America. America claims to be helping the reduction of coca plantations in Colombia so why does 80% of the worlds cocaine still come from there? A question that will remain a mystery for eternity i feel. Thanks
Marc Lowden, Manchester
I was shocked to discover what was really happening in Columbia. I myself have tried cocaine but I don't think I will be taking it ever again. I cant believe it is mixed with petrol and concrete, that is disgusting. Apart from what it is made from it is shocking to realise that people are killed everyday just because people in Europe wanting to have a good time. If I am ever offered cocaine again I will be sure to think of who will die in replace of it.
Laura , Glasgow , UK
Very informative documentary however, a little disrespectful to Colombia by spelling its name incorrectly four times on screen! Having lived there during the late 1980's and early 1990's, I know how irate the Colombians become upon seeing their country's name incorrectly spelt. Come on BBC, get it right!
Fay Howlett, Camberley Surrey
So with all the trouble caused with Cocaine being a class A drug, surely it would be better if you could buy it in a shop after it had been grown in a factory in England?
Myself, Nottingham, UK
I watched the programme last night with interest. I have a very good friend from Colombia who gets annoyed that all everyone talks about when Colombia is mentioned is drugs and kidnapping. However none of us in the West can forget that what we do here has a direct effect on people in others. I have taken cocaine myself when I was younger and I agree with Alex James that when you are enjoying the high, the last thing you think about is the misery caused to the producers, or even how it is made. But as the dealer featured said, he doesn't offer it, people come looking for it and until we stop using it here, people will continue to be caught up in this horrific trade.
Danielle Fortier, Sheffield, UK
Some interesting angles, but my Colombian wife and I came away wondering how such a prestigious program could repeatedly use captions showing the Canadian province of Columbia instead of the country of Colombia.
Paul McGrath, London
I can't believe that with subject matter as dense and complicated as the cocaine business in Columbia, the BBC felt that it merited only 30 minutes of air time. It was clearly a difficult and harrowing trip for Alex James but the viewer was given no time to understand the various elements being discussed before being moved on to the next theme. This should have been a 90 minute special - I feel slightly short-changed and I'm not sure that James will feel it was worthwhile to risk his life for such a poor final production.
Alan Martin, London, England
Having lived in Colombia and seen the social and human devastation caused by cocaine, this is a very average, low impact poorly documented and presented programme. On top of that, twice "Colombia" was written " Columbia" , makes you wander what grade of cocaine the people who make the programme are on if BBC staff can't even spell properly!
Desiree Lllewellyn, London
I thought the program was excellent, it is right that people understand the full implications, not just to themselves about taking drugs. This is a very difficult issue that does not have any simple answers, unfortunately a lot of people find out too late what a problem these drugs are and can be, no one seems to be able to learn from others, they seem to have to make their own mind up. Alex, Kingston, UK
Sadly, although interesting to watch and shocking in places, this programme did not go far enough to emphasise the human misery and bloodshed caused to those innocent Columbians whose lives are afflicted by this trade. It seemed to mostly show those people who had chosen a life involved in the supply chain and who, presumably, had taken the calculated risk in order to reap some of the benefits of the business. Unfortunately it won't be enough to turn around most of the people I know who partake and they'll continue to think I'm just a killjoy for banging on about it!
Jayne, Ruislip, Middlesex
How seriously should we take Panorama nowadays? Using Alex James, who has no discernible talent as a journalist, was a stunt that detracted from a moderately interesting story. Did he do a better job than a professional journalist? Of course not. And the editors really need to do some basic homework - over the opening shots of Bogota, they had helpfully put a title which identified the city, and named the country as Columbia. Oh dear.
Richard, Ashford, UK
Alex James and Vice-President Santos are right. Many of the street-children with whom I work here in Medell�n have paid with their lives for the thoughtless self-indulgence of the consumers of cocaine in countries like Britain. The consumers are the real criminals because it is their money that fuels the violence in Colombia. I hope that your programme will encourage people to support the British charities that work in Colombia.
Fr Peter Walters, Medellin, Colombia
I watched this program for 2 reasons. 1 because my girlfriend is a huge Blur fan so if Alex had been appearing on anything I would have no choice and 2 because I am an ex-cocaine addict. In all honesty, having not had any drugs for about 3 months now and no intention of doing so, all I wanted after that program was drugs. I turned crabbit, bad tempered and rather huffy that I'd given them up and I couldn't get any - but then I knew within myself that I didn't really want any anyway. I know that sounds like a total contradiction - I'm not sounding very concise. I apologise. The matter is that I didn't care about the dealers or the farmers or the enforcers - dealers and enforcers get what they deserve - they know the risks they take. Farmers, if they had the choice, would do something else - maybe - but starving children would rather do something else than starve. That's a bit harsh. Supply and demand is what it's all about - there is a supply the world over and it can only come from Columbia. God I sound like a junkie again. There is no perfect world but credit to Alex James - I'm not a Blur fan but I respect what he did and the message he tried to get across. If only one Blur fan or indeed any one person stops cocaine due to watching this program then that's a good thing.

Storms batter southern England
See how the storm has hit southern England
In pictures Winds of up to 80mph have battered southern England as severe storms move in from the Atlantic.
A tanker with 13 crew on board got into difficulty off the Isle of Wight as the island experienced 70mph gusts. A tree came down on a house in Lytchett Matravers, near Poole, but there were no reports of any injuries.
Forecasters warned Solent Coastguard to expect more gales up to violent storm force 11. Ferries across the region were affected.
Southsea seafront was closed to traffic and floodgates in Old Portsmouth were shut after a warning of very high tides.
In Dorset, one of the worst-hit areas, police said there had been no major incidents, although fallen trees could cause travel problems.
The hovercraft from Portsmouth to Ryde was suspended, while the Red Jet catamaran service and the Red Funnel vehicle ferry between Southampton and the Isle of Wight were cancelled earlier.
Unless your journey is absolutely essential I would not travel
Insp Mike KynastonDorset Police
P&O Ferries cancelled its Sunday sailing from Portsmouth to Bilbao, Spain, and the return journey on Tuesday.
The Bramblemet weather station, in the central Solent, measured highest gusts of 48.3 knots, gale force 10.
Hyde Primary School, Fordingbridge, was forced to close due to a loss of heating and power. Phone lines were brought down in Main Road, Dibden, while power cables came down in Grove Road, Barton on Sea. A tree came down on the A259 in Emsworth.
A Hampshire police spokeswoman said there was the possibility of flooding on the A3.
"We'd like to advise motorists to be extremely aware that they are likely to come across flooding and quite a bit of debris on roads," she said.
The effects of the bad weather were also felt in north Hampshire and Berkshire, where many trees fell on to roads including the A30 and Basing Road, Basingstoke, the A4 in Woolhampton and Newbury, and George Street in Kingsclere. Tanker 'at risk' off island
Insp Mike Kynaston, of Dorset Police, warned people to make only "essential" journeys.
"Unless your journey is absolutely essential I would not travel, and if you are travelling do so with extreme caution," he said.
The Environment Agency opened its national incident room, warning of the risk of high waves and flooding in southern England.
The agency is urging people to stay away from exposed coastal areas and to check for flood warnings in their area as strong winds, waves and high tides would continue until Wednesday.

Teach yourself happy
By Denise Winterman
BBC News Magazine
Lessons in emotions should be introduced in all schools in England, says the government, in the latest twist on what's known as "emotional intelligence". But can children really be taught how to be happy?
Do you offer complete strangers a shoulder to cry on when England fail to fulfil their potential in yet another World Cup? Or did you shed a few tears of your own when Take That got back together - after crying a river when they split up?
There's a term for people like you - and it's one you can repeat in front of your mother. In fact, she might even be proud to know you're what psychologists call "emotionally intelligent". Being aware of your emotions and managing them, along with those of other people, is nothing new - be it crying over the football, the birth of a child or a death. The importance of emotional expression was debated by the likes of Plato and entered the work of people like Charles Darwin.
WHAT IS EI?
Knowing your emotions
Managing your own emotions
Motivating yourself
Recognising and understanding other people's emotions
Handling the emotions of others
Source: Daniel Goleman
Pupils to get respect lessons
But the term emotional intelligence (EI) is a relatively new one. Despite its recent arrival it has become embedded in our vernacular and linked to almost every area of life. From contentment in your home life to success in the workplace, it always seems irrevocably wrapped up in your ability to get in touch with your feeling - and others. The government even wants EI taught in all classrooms. A pilot scheme in primary schools found it improved behaviour and academic performance. This week ministers announced they now wanted to extend such lessons to secondary schools. So when did EI become so important and why? The term - and the theory behind it - was popularised by psychologist Daniel Goleman. His book of the same name became a bestseller in 1995 and sold millions of copies worldwide. From there a whole industry rapidly grew. If you work you might have been on a training course to help you develop your EI, run by the one of a multitude of EI institutes, companies and organisations. If you watch television, you'll be familiar with the confessional, soul searching programme format that seems to constantly be on our screens, of which Oprah Winfrey is the queen.
'Egalitarian'
Its rise has run parallel with the growth of the feelings culture in western society, say some psychologists. Which came first is a classic chicken-and-egg quandary, but what is clear is both have flourished with the help of each other.
"The primary reason emotional intelligence is so popular is that the concept is in tune with the spirit and popular culture of the times," says psychologist Gerry Matthews, co-author of Emotional Intelligence: Science and Myth. "Western culture has a long history of equivocation about the value of emotions, and the extent to which the head should over-rule the heart. Recent years have seen increasing value placed on awareness and expression of emotions.
Just plain emotional?
"Enthusiasm for it probably also resonates with a disenchantment with a society that seems increasingly set on reducing individuals to numbers, through things like standardised testing and biometric data."
The fact it's a "different way of being smart" is also key to its popularity, say others. The theory argues that IQ is not the only thing that dictates how successful we are. "We live in a society where people don't like to think others are better than them, so we come up with these phrases to make everyone feel they are intelligent in their own special way," says philosopher Julian Baggini. "It feels egalitarian, no one can be written off by society." It's a theory that has a lot of positives. Acknowledging all sorts of social and moral situations require emotional insight to come to the right decision is a "positive thing", says Mr Baggini.
But there's also been a lot of hype about EI and some doubt its scientific credentials.
'Cultural influences'
"It is a great commercial opportunity for some," says Professor Goleman. "Money can be made through marketing new tests and training courses for industry. Some of the marketing efforts have been pretty aggressive."
He argues there is a fundamental difficulty in testing EI and it's often impossible to specify objectively what is the most emotionally intelligent behaviour in a given situation.
"Tests for EI are of limited value in that the test score tends to reflect a subjective judgment as to what are the 'right' and 'wrong' answers - whether the judgement comes from the developer, outside experts or group consensus.
EI can be used in the wrong way
"Such judgments are likely to be dependent on social and cultural influences. If the tests had been invented 50 years ago, they would probably have rewarded a 'stiff upper lip' and constrained emotional expression, in contrast to contemporary tests."
The current emergence of EI into education is a direct result of the introduction National Curriculum in 1988, says Professor Susan Hallam, author of the Institute of Education (IoE) study looking at the teaching of EI in primary schools.
"Prior to the National Curriculum schools had a duty to develop the whole child, that flew out of the window when it was introduced," she says. The IoE's study showed positive results from the introduction of lessons in EI - from the classroom to the playground - but Professor Hallam says the term in general is "a bit of a red herring".
Label lovers
"Emotional intelligence and understanding your own emotions does not mean you use them in a positive way. It's the same in schools as it is in society. "It's not only about being aware of the way you, and others, feel - there's a moral element. Bullies are often very emotionally intelligent, they just don't use it in a positive way."
Including a moral framework into EI lessons is a key part of their success, she says.
Ultimately, like any theory, EI will always be open to debate. But maybe its rapid rise in the public consciousness comes down to something rather simple - people like to put labels on things.
"We love doing it because it validates something and makes it seem more real," says Mr Baggini. Below is a selection of your comments. I work with kids and schools and use Emotional Literacy - same concept! I wholly support that schools should grasp this concept with both hands and teach it/embrace it with kids from a very early age.
Anon, Lancashire
"Lessons in emotions?" Oh please! People smile when they are happy. If for some reason an individual finds it difficult to laugh or smile, could it be possible or, if not indeed, probable that that person is not happy. A persons unhappy can be triggered by deep issues. So how can school or classes be the answer to making someone smile until these classes are prepared to understand each individuals deep and personal issues in order to try and assist the psychological issues of that person. Sounds like a cheap, nasty, unworkable answer to 'good ole fashion' counselling to me.Ivor, London, ENGLAND
Teaching EI in schools will be subject to the same right-on trendyism that PHSE - personal, social and health education - and Citizenship are. My children were reticent and still dislike public emotional display in others as well as themselves. I can imagine their school reports stating that they have "failed" [though I believe that particular F-word is no longer allowed in state schools] EI because their stiff upper lips and distaste for US-import hugging and kissing didn't fit the PC bill. In fact I'm surprised I haven't been arrested for emotionally crippling them.Diane Baker, Leeds UK
Why is crying about something classed as being emotionally intelligent. Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems then that emotional intelligence is less about managing your emotions and more about letting everyone else know how you feel. If EI is based upon emotional management then those who feel it but only choose when to show it should score more highly.
It's another way to imprint positivity on a nation of idiots. Keep 'em happy. No revolts.Bill, London
It is essential that people learn how to manage their emotions and feelings so that they can behave in a way that does not adversely affect other people. There is a culture of people feeling that their own self-expression is more important than the rights of people around them, and it is this type of belief that should be addressed and dispelled.Karl Chads, London, UK
This is just where fathers are important for children. Respect is learnt in the rough & tumble that dads always play with their young children. With the epidemic of fatherlessness from the appalling way family courts are treating fathers and children post separation, many children are not getting these crucial lessons, as about 25% of children are fatherless, this significant group will be making respect uncool. Education later is teaching after the 'hardwiring of the brain' has been set, like closing the door after the horse has bolted. Solve family law, solve respect!Peter, NorthWest
As Ron Weasley has the emotional range of a teaspoon (Hermione: The Order of the Phoenix), I guess Hogwarts needs to introduce this subject.Tim Fox, Beckenham
Emotional intelligence is only partly about "being emotional" - it's more to do with being in touch with your feelings, or emotional maturity. Anger management or assertiveness training would come under EI for instance. Therefore it seems to me a legitimate subject for study at school - and if more time were spent on EI bad behaviour among young people would certainly diminish, both in schools and in the wider world.

A tale of two autumnal displays
Matt Walker
Editor, Earth News
Autumn displays produce a variety of hues
The swathes of beautifully coloured leaves produced by trees each autumn are one of nature's great displays.But why trees in Europe tend to produce yellow leaves, while those in America and eastern Asia produce red leaves, has remained an enigma. Now scientists have published a theory that could explain the difference. They believe that red-leafed trees in America and Asia only exist because they and their insect pests managed to survive a series of ice ages long ago. So say botanists Simcha Lev-Yadun of the University of Haifa-Oranim, Israel and Jarmo Holopainen of the University of Kuopio in Finland, who have published a review of leaf colour and its causes in the journal New Phytologist. Until a decade ago, scientists understood very little about why trees produce leaves of different colours, and at different times of the year. Then came a surge of interest into why trees in temperate forests produce a range of hues each autumn. For example, the mixed forests of New Jersey turn predominately red, as do maple trees in Japan, while beech forests in Patagonia turn red and orange. Yet the forests of Europe turn predominately yellow. Leaves usually look green because they contain higher levels of cholorophyll relative to their other pigments. But leaves do not turn red or yellow because they are dying. Instead, trees produce less chlorophyll in autumn, so the yellow and red carotenoid pigments already in the leaf come to the fore. At this time of year, the trees also produce more anthocyanins, a red-purple pigment. When the leaves start to die, they turn brown.
Some forest turn yellow not red There are thought to be various reasons for the colour change. One idea is that the anthocyanins protect the leaves against the damaging effects of light, which are worse in the autumn as canopies become thinner and the plants fix less carbon due to falling temperatures. That would allow the trees to keep healthier leaves, and to withdraw more nutrients from them before they drop. But the evidence for this remains inconclusive. Another idea is that different coloured leaves fend off insects that might otherwise eat them. Deep red leaves might signal to insects, such as aphids, that the leaves contain higher concentrations of toxic chemicals, lack nutrients or may shortly die. And evidence for this idea is stronger. One review of 262 tree species showed that those with red colours have a long evolutionary history with aphids. The insects try to lay eggs on the trees in autumn and the trees respond in an evolutionary arms race, signalling ever more strongly that their leaves are unappealing. But these ideas cannot fully explain why Europe has more trees with yellow leaves than in America or eastern Asia. Climatic triggerLev-Yadun and Holopainen have proposed that the trigger for the difference first occurred millions years ago in the Tertiary Period. They suggested that temperate forests evolved from tropical plants during this time. Many young tropical trees produce red leaves they said, and old leaves in the tropics are also often red-coloured. So temperate forests inherited this ability to produce red leaves.

But 35 million years ago, the world started to drastically cool and warm, as a series of ice ages covered large swathes of Europe and North America. Plants could only survive in a few southerly refuges. North America and East Asia have mountain ridges that run north to south. As each ice age took grip, red-leafed trees migrated south along the mountain ridges into refugia where they survived, before migrating back north as the climate warmed. In Europe, the mountain ranges run east to west. That meant that any red-leafed trees north of the mountains were trapped, and went extinct. The insects that had been engaged in a long evolutionary arms race with these trees also died out with them. "The selective agents of herbivory that cause red leaves went extinct, resulting in lower selection for red leaves," said Lev-Yadun. That broke the evolutionary arms race between insects and the trees, allowing those trees that recolonised Europe to put less effort into deterring aphids from their leaves. As a result, European forests tend to produce glorious swathes of yellow each autumn. "Red in a way is an old adaptation reflecting stresses from the Tertiary herbivorous fauna," said Ley-Yadun. Further support for Lev-Yadun and Holopainen's hypothesis is that dwarf shrubs with red leaves, rather than trees, dominate the northern parts of Scandinavia. That suggests that trees in the area were wiped out by snow and ice, which the low-lying shrubs could survive. As the trees were wiped out, so were their pests - a luxury not afforded to the generations of plants in America and East Asia.

Derry City board members resign
Derry City chairman Pat McDaid has announced his resignation
The chairman of Derry City Football Club has resigned along with three of its board members.Pat McDaid said he would be stepping down along with Joe W Doherty, Peter Leonard and Francis Houston. Mr McDaid said his relationship with the FAI had now "reached the point of no return". The club's players also released a statement on Tuesday night which distanced them from what they described as the Derry board's "wrongdoing". City were expelled from the League of Ireland after the FAI said they broke regulations by holding secondary, unofficial contracts with players. A statement released on behalf of the Candystripes' players by the Professional Footballers' Association of Ireland, said that the events of the past week had come "as a major shock and disappointment to the players of Derry City Football Club". "Until the allegations of 'dual contracts' were made very recently, no player was aware of the existence of a second document which contained different figures to the one which we had originally agreed. "The position is that at the beginning of the contract period, each player was presented with a document on Derry City headed paper which contained income amounts which we each individually agreed with the club. We wish to have nothing to do with this wrongdoing
Derry City players statement
"With only one exception, no player knowingly signed a second document. "It now appears that, what the club had misrepresented to us as a blank registration form containing no figures, terms or conditions, was, in fact, a second document upon which different figures were subsequently entered and lodged with the league. "The full terms of this contract were never made available to the players and we fully believed that the wages which we were being paid were disclosed to the league in accordance with normal practice. "As soon as the players became aware of the situation, we have immediately agreed to set the record straight and we wish to have nothing to do with this wrongdoing. "We are deeply distressed at this turn of events and we wish to distance ourselves entirely from the board's conduct." The Derry players' statement came shortly after the announcement of the resignation of club chairman Pat McDaid and three other directors. Their move left club vice-chairman Stephen McCarron as sole remaining member of the Derry board. McDaid said that his decision was "an important step to ensure Derry City return to the League of Ireland". "It's quite clear my relationship with Mr Delaney and the FAI has reached a point of no return," he said. Another day of dramatic developments had included Derry goalkeeper Darren Quigley's defence of his decison to contact the FAI which apparently alerted the governing body about the alleged unofficial payments to over 20 Candystripes players. Darren Quigley is currently on loan with Sporting Fingal
Quigley, currently on loan at Sporting Fingal, went to the FAI after not being paid by the Brandywell club. "I didn't know I had two contracts - I had to go to the FAI. They've got to chase the money I'm owed." Quigley denied that he had been the "whistleblower" in the saga. He added: "I can't understand how any player can alert the FAI that they are on two contracts if they did not know they were on two contracts." FAI Chief John Delaney claimed on Monday that Derry had withheld details of payments to players over a period of years. He also warned Derry players to disclose details of their pay or face the prospect of not being registered "at home or abroad" next season. FAI and League of Ireland officials claim to have uncovered evidence that over 20 Derry players held under-the-table contracts with the club. Delaney added that in those circumstances, the club would not be awarded its 60,000 Euro prize money for finishing fourth in the league. He also warned on Monday that Derry's players had until next Thursday to give full financial information about their pay to the FAI or the Player's Union. Failure to give the information would result in the FAI not registering players at home or abroad next season, Delaney added. Following news of the resignation of the Derry directors and the players' comments on Tuesday night, the FAI later released a statement saying that it accepted the "players' assurances that they were not personally aware of any financial irregularities at the club". "The FAI also recognise the difficulties that have been created by the club in not paying players for the last eight/nine weeks at Derry City FC, and the impact that has on each player and his immediate family "The FAI has also confirmed that it intends to send a delegation to Derry, on Thursday, with a view to beginning the process of returning the club to stability, now that the Club Chairman has accepted his untenable position."
