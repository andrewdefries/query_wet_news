UN upbeat on tsunami hunger aid
Aid is being distributed, and no disease has been reported
The UN says it is optimistic that none of the survivors of the Asian tsunami will lose their lives to hunger.
Jim Morris, head of the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said he expected food aid to reach almost all survivors within the next seven days. More than 150,000 people have been killed across Asia. The UN has warned that the toll could rise further as a result of hunger and disease.
But no major outbreaks have been reported so far.
The BBC's Matt Frei says officials in a number of refugee camps in Sri Lanka have told him that disease is being contained and people are recovering.
'Optimistic'
The WFP head told the BBC that aid had reached "nearly everyone who has been harmed by the disaster".
"Through our partners, a good many NGOs, we've found ways to get food to everyone who's in need," he said.
He said the agency was feeding 750,000 people in Sri Lanka, and up to 150,000 in Indonesia - primarily in Aceh province, the worst-hit by the earthquake and the tsunami on 26 December.
Mr Annan was the latest high-profile visitor to witness the devastation
"That number will go above 300,000 in the next few days, probably to 400,000 in the next five or six days," Mr Morris said. "Our job is to get food to people to save lives, to address the special nutritional issues relating to women who are pregnant, nursing, and to young children."
Mr Morris said he was optimistic the agency would have everything it needed - an estimated $280m "for food for the next six months, to feed two million people, and for the logistics transport component".
Food distribution to Indonesia, the worst-hit country, is expected to speed up following the opening of a humanitarian air hub at Subang near the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, on Friday.
It takes almost twice as long to reach the hard-hit province of Aceh from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, as it does from Subang.

Armenia country profile
A landlocked country with Turkey to the west and Georgia to the north, Armenia boasts a history longer than most other European countries Situated along the route of the Great Silk Road, it has fallen within the orbit of a number of cultural influences and empires. After independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia quickly became drawn into a bloody conflict with Azerbaijan over the mostly Armenian-speaking region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Overview

Facts

Media
One of the earliest Christian civilisations, its first churches were founded in the fourth century. In later centuries, it frequently oscillated between Byzantine, Persian, Mongol or Turkish control, as well as periods of independence. Its rich cultural and architectural heritage combines elements from different traditions. The Armenian language is part of the Indo-European family, but its alphabet is unique. Divided between the Persians and Ottomans in the 16th century, eastern Armenian territories became part of the Russian Empire in the early 19th century, while the rest stayed within the Ottoman Empire.
Republic Square in Yerevan
Between 1915 and 1917, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians died at the hands of government troops in the Ottoman Empire. Yerevan wants Turkey, and the world, to recognize the deaths as genocide, and some countries have done so. However, Turkey says that there was no genocide and that the dead were victims of World War I, and that ethnic Turks also suffered in the conflict. The governments of the two countries agreed to normalise relations in October 2009, although Turkey has said opening the border will depend on progress on the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute. An independent Republic of Armenia was proclaimed at the end of the first world war but was short-lived, lasting only until the beginning of the 1920s when the Bolsheviks incorporated it into the Soviet Union. When Soviet rule collapsed in 1991, Armenia regained independence but retained a Russian military base at Gyumri. In the mid-1990s the government embarked on an economic reform programme which brought some stability and growth. The country became a member of the Council of Europe in 2001. Unemployment and poverty remain widespread. Armenia's economic problems are aggravated by a trade blockade imposed by neighbouring Turkey and Azerbaijan since the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite these problems, Armenia's economy experienced several years of double-digit growth before a sharp downturn set in in 2008. The conflict over the predominantly Armenian-populated region in Azerbaijan overshadowed Armenia's return to independence. Full-scale war broke out the same year as ethnic Armenians in Karabakh fought for independence, supported by troops and resources from Armenia proper. A ceasefire in place since 1994 has failed to deliver any lasting solution. Armenia receives most of its gas supply from Russia and, like some other republics of the former Soviet Union, has had to face sharp price rises. Russian gas arrives via a pipeline running through Georgia. Armenia has a huge diaspora and has always experienced waves of emigration, but the exodus of recent years has caused real alarm. It is estimated that Armenia has lost up to a quarter of its population since independence, as young families seek what they hope will be a better life abroad. Facts

President: Serge Sarkisian In presidential elections held in February 2008, Prime Minister Serge Sarkisian was declared winner in the first round with 52.9% of the vote. But thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets to protest the poll, which they say was rigged. President Sarkisian is a close ally of predecessor Robert Kocharian
Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Mr Sarkisian and Europe's main election monitoring body, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said the vote had mostly met international standards. Outgoing President and close ally, Robert Kocharian, handpicked the prime minister to succeed him after Sarkisian's Republican Party swept parliamentary polls in May 2007. Serge Sarkisian was a Soviet soldier and later worked in the defence-committee of the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. He was then appointed Armenia's minister of defence. He had a spell as minister of national security and head of the presidential staff before returning to the defence ministry. Mr Sarkisian faces the challenge of restarting stalled talks in the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. He has also pledged to use his time as leader to improve living standards for the Armenian people. In 2009, he signed signed a historic deal to re-establish diplomatic ties with Turkey, but the pact broke down when Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted it depended on Armenia resolving its dispute with Azerbaijan first. Mr Sarkisian was born in Nagorno-Karabakh in 1954. Media

Media
Television is Armenia's dominant medium. There are more than 40 private TV stations, operating alongside the two public networks. The main Russian TV channels are widely available. Few Armenians rely on newspapers as their primary source of news. Print runs are small and most publications are owned by wealthy individuals or political parties. Censorship is prohibited under a 2004 media law. However, libel and defamation are punishable by prison terms and journalists have been sentenced under these laws. The authorities use "informal pressure" to control broadcasting outlets, Freedom House said in 2010. Violence against journalists is a problem, it added. There were 1.4 million internet users by June 2010 (InternetWorldStats.com).

Asylum children to face returns
By Dominic Casciani
BBC News Community affairs
Removals: Ministers have pledged to increase rates
The UK government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to Albania.
The trial scheme, which could start in weeks, may be extended to apply to children from other countries. Children's charities have reacted with alarm, saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected.
But the Home Office says it may be in the children's best interests if it reunites them with their communities.
9,000 arrivals
The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.
Unaccompanied asylum seeking children 3,445 under-17s assessed in 2003:
4% granted asylum
32% granted exceptional leave to remain
40% granted humanitarian protection
15% refused Source: Home Office Since 2002, at least 9,000 under-18s have arrived in the UK to seek asylum without other family members. These children automatically become the responsibility of social services. Up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. At least a dozen Albanian-born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers. Those selected could either be returned to their families, should they be traced, or placed in the care of other Albanian authorities. Separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.
'Forced removal'
Under the 1989 Children Act, public bodies have a duty to act in the "best interest" of a child in their care. Laura Brownlees of Save the Children said there were grave concerns, not least because of the well-documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in Albania. From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account
Andrew Hogg, Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture
"If children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis," she said.
"We do not think there are structures in place [to receive returning children in Albania].
'If these decisions are not in the best interests of the child, then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision."
In its five-year immigration plan, announced on Tuesday, the government said it was addressing "the difficult issue" of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children.
A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children "and leave them to rot". "We are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused," said the spokesman.
"We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.
Asylum children: State must act in their "best interests"
"We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities."
The spokesman stressed the UK would abide by its international human rights obligations.
Only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned, he said.
But Andrew Hogg, spokesman for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies.
"From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account," said Mr Hogg. "In Albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure. "The Medical Foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries."
A spokesman for the Albanian embassy in London said it was the first it had heard of a scheme, but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.

Police raids target loan sharks
Police found a notebook documenting the alleged loans
Police in Bristol have raided two houses on an estate in north Bristol as part of a clampdown on loan sharks.
The South West Illegal Money Lending Team and the police arrested three people, including a 77-year-old woman, in the early morning raid in Horfield.
It is claimed victims gave benefit payments directly to a loan shark, who then gave them �50 a week back in "pocket money".
Investigating officers found a notebook documenting the alleged loans.
'Criminal lifestyle'
The government claims loan sharks are making illegal loans to 165,000 households across the country.
The Illegal Money Lending Team said victims were almost always single parents who could not borrow from banks.
Alan Evans, from the organisation, said: "Once you're hooked, you are there for life.
"They won't just draw you into the criminal lifestyle but they will take over your life and the lives of your children."
His colleague Wendy Loades said: "One of my victims could have borrowed �2,000 five years ago [and] has now paid back �15,000, that's the sort of scale we're looking at."
The Illegal Money Lending Team is led by Bristol City Council Trading Standards and covers the whole of the South West.

Bomb 'largest found' in recent years
The scene was cordoned off by police
Police in Northern Ireland have said an 1,100lb bomb defused on Tuesday is the largest found in recent years.
An RUC spokesman said the bomb, found near Armagh, was designed to kill members of the security forces. It is thought to have been the work of dissident republican paramilitaries.
A command wire was found about 150 yards from where the device was found.
Searches around the area where the bomb would have been detonated from continue.
The device has now been taken away for forensic examination.
Two controlled explosions were carried out on the bomb during the operation of defuse it.
The explosives were packed into two rubbish bins.
The bomb was discovered at Brootally Cross on the Monaghan Road by a joint police and army patrol on Saturday. Speaking on Tuesday, RUC Chief Constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan said: "It was undoubtedly deployed to kill our officers or to kill our military colleagues who would have passed by".
Dissident republican paramilitaries are opposed to the current peace process in Northern Ireland and have been linked to a number of recent attacks on the security forces. Seamus Mallon: Condemned those behind the bomb
Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon, of the nationalist SDLP, condemned those involved in the manufacture of the bomb which he said was "clearly designed to kill and maim".
"This was yet another blatant attempt by those opposed to democracy who are intent on destabilising society," he added.
"Those who are engaged in such activities have nothing positive to offer the people of this island."
The security forces carried out a painstaking search of the area for secondary devices, before moving in to defuse the bomb which was primed and ready for use. It was considered too dangerous for army bomb disposal experts to bring in their equipment by road. Instead it was flown in by helicopter.
Ulster Unionist assembly member for the area Danny Kennedy said the discovery had implications for the security situation.
He said that given the "level of threat" there should not be any reduction in the security network in the area.
"It is operating very effectively against republican dissidents and against paramilitaries in the area," he said.
"Any move against that would be completely disastrous."
Paul Berry: "Still republican threat"
Paul Berry of the Democratic Unionist Party said there was "still a very high level of threat from the republican movement in south Armagh". "Security must be increased, not reduced in that area," he said.
Sir Ronnie also said the security forces had been very successful against dissident republicans but there was a danger that the public could become complacent. Meanwhile, dissident republican paramilitaries have also been blamed for an attack on a police car in County Tyrone.
No-one was injured in the explosion in Cookstown on Sunday night, but the vehicle was damaged.
An object exploded at the rear of a police car in the Drum Road area of the town, close to two hotels.

Fox launches Tory leadership bid
Dr Fox poses for the cameras with fiancee Jesme Baird
Liam Fox has announced his intention to run for the leadership of the Conservative Party, saying he wanted to broaden the party's appeal.
The shadow foreign secretary said the party should concentrate on real people's concerns rather than itself.
He later spoke of his desire for British Schools to fly the Union Jack flag, copying the US and Australia.
Rivals Ken Clarke and David Davis targeted Labour's economic record in speeches also on Thursday.
'Common identity'
Dr Fox launched his leadership bid at the Hillside Clubhouse in North London, a centre for the mentally ill.
It was a deliberate contrast with Ken Clarke's launch of his campaign Fox attempts a different tone
In Depth: Tory contest
Speaking to reporters outside the centre, he said that as a medical doctor issues such as mental illness were important to him.
He said his aim was for a "forward looking, confident Tory party" and one which represented the people of Great Britain, rather than Conservatives themselves.
"What we need is an agenda for the country ... We are politicians for the people we represent", he told reporters, adding that in the recent past the party had become more famous for its leadership elections than anything else.
The party had to tackle issues such as crime and the break up of the family.
"We do not do it by talking about ourselves," he added.
In his first campaign interview, he told London's Evening Standard newspaper he believed British schools should fly the Union Flag, in manner similar to schools in the US and Australia.
"I'm suggesting that all schools fly the British flag outside to emphasise to people that wherever they have come from, whatever their background, they share a common identity," he said, although he added he did not think pupils should swear an American-style allegiance to the flag.
'Good critical mass'
Earlier Dr Fox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he believed he had a "good critical mass" of support behind him to fight the campaign.
Asked whether he thought the leadership would be simply a battle between Ken Clarke and David Davis, he replied: "I remember people said that Iain Duncan Smith had no chance, and that Michael Portillo was a dead cert."
Eight MPs have declared their support for his campaign, which is headed by shadow Commons leader Chris Grayling. Leadership contender Kenneth Clarke criticised Gordon Brown's reign in the Treasury in a speech on Thursday, while David Davis also berated the chancellor in an article in The Scotsman.
Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind is continuing his attempt to woo Tory activists on a tour of Britain. E-mail this to a friend

Meyer to stay at press watchdog
Sir Christopher described several ministers as "political pygmies"
Britain's former ambassador to Washington has written to John Prescott to say he will not step down as head of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC).
The deputy prime minister had urged Sir Christopher Meyer to resign after he published a book criticising him and other senior politicians.
Mr Prescott also raised questions about his impartiality as PCC chairman.
But Sir Christopher said he did not believe the contents of his book prevented him from doing his job.
'Political pygmies'
In his letter, he said: "I intend to continue to carry out my duties as I have sought to discharge them in the last two and three-quarter years: impartially, independently and effectively."
His book, DC Confidential, serialised in two national newspapers, covers the period from 1997 to 2003, and comments on the build up to war with Iraq. I do not believe that the contents of my book prevent me from acting as chairman of the PCC Sir Christopher Meyer
In it, Sir Christopher dubs several Cabinet ministers as "political pygmies" . He describes Mr Prescott arriving "at the embassy like a mastiff with his hackles up". And he notes the deputy prime minister "never appeared to be sufficiently up on these (foreign policy) issues". At one meeting with a US senator about the former Yugoslavia, Mr Prescott is quoted talking about war in the "Balklands" and "Kovosa". 'Alarmed'
Publication of the book prompted Mr Prescott to ask Sir Christopher: "How can I or others criticised in your book come to the PCC in future and expect impartiality when you have made it clear you are anything but?
"How can you now hope to be an 'honest broker' at the PCC if people suspect they may feature in any future literary effort on your part?"
He also said: "I am alarmed that you are perfectly happy to profit from tittle-tattle, betraying confidences and by character assassination - the kind of behaviour you at the PCC should be protecting the public from."
But in a detailed rebuttal letter to Mr Prescott, Sir Christopher argued that his book had been submitted to the Cabinet Office for approval.
If the PCC received a complaint about the book or him, he would "follow the well-established practice" of not taking part in considering it "where there is a real or perceived conflict of interest", he said.
Neither he nor his agent had been involved in negotiations with national papers about serialising the book, he said - that job had been done by his publishers.
He added: "In light of the above, I do not believe that the contents of my book prevent me from acting as chairman of the PCC and interpreting the Code of Practice in accordance with past decisions of the Commission."

Bolton 0-1 Portsmouth
More Premiership photos
Allardyce frustrated by defeat
Jordan pleased after win Arjan de Zeeuw's goal ensured Velimir Zajec's first game in charge of Portsmouth ended in victory.
De Zeeuw headed home Gary O'Neil's free-kick on the stroke of half-time, while Patrik Berger also had two good chances to score for Pompey.
Bolton created little, although Jamie Ashdown saved well from Kevin Davies and Radhi Jaidi hooked the ball over from short range after the break.
And as Bolton's frustrations grew El-Hadji Diouf seemed to spit at De Zeeuw.
Pompey had lost their previous three games but life after Harry Redknapp began with a victory.
It is a welcome boost for Pompey, who had not won away all season, but it was a poor performance from Bolton, who followed up last week's superb comeback at Chelsea with an uninspired home display.
Bolton enjoyed the majority of the play in the opening half but struggled to create clear-cut openings.
Okocha shot wide from long range and then caught the Pompey defence unawares with a quick free-kick out to Diouf.
Great end to a bad week! Who cares now Pompey live on!
From P
Have your say on 606
The Senegal international passed the mall back to Okocha but the Nigerian's shot struck a melee of players between him and goal.
Diouf burst down the right and into the Pompey area after 27 minutes before passing to Stelios Giannakopoulos but the Greece international was crowded out.
Okocha resisted the attentions of several Pompey players before playing a delightful ball to Diouf, who turned and shot from 12 yards only to be thwarted by a good save from Ashdown.
Ricardo Fuller had Pompey's first strike at goal, cutting in from the left but pushing his shot wide of Jussi Jaaskelainen's goal.
Okocha tried once more from long range before the break, while Berger had an excellent chance to score for the visitors.
The Czech Republic start had a clear sight of goal from 12 yards after cutting inside Bruno N'Gotty but made poor contact with his shot and Jaaskelainen saved.
But just as it seemed the first-half would end goalless De Zeeuw headed Pompey into the lead.
Zajec watched Pompey from the stands
Nicky Hunt was penalised for a foul on Matthew Taylor and De Zeeuw headed home the subsequent free-kick, which was superbly delivered by Gary O'Neil.
Davies almost concluded a goalmouth scramble with an equaliser after 48 minutes but Ashdown smothered his shot.
Shortly afterwards Jaidi should have scored after Davies' flick put him in space but he scooped the ball over the Pompey crossbar.
Berger almost scored a sensational second for Pompey - but after running at goal from the half-way line he dragged his shot narrowly wide.
Bolton defender Ricardo Gardner was stretchered off, while both Fuller and De Zeeuw went close for Pompey.
Sam Allardyce introduced Henrik Pedersen after 62 minutes to add more threat up front and the home side went in search of an equaliser.
Diouf thought he should have had a penalty after the lightest of contact with Andy Griffin and Okocha missed the target with a free-kick.
And with time running out Diouf appeared to spit in the direction of De Zeeuw, who did not react to the incident.
It was almost the final act, but in injury-time Berger forced a save from Jaaskelainen.

Gardner (Hierro 57), Okocha, Campo (Nolan 88), Speed, Diouf,
Davies, Giannakopoulos.

Syria: 'A country convulsed by war'
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
The UN Security Council has condemned the Syrian government for using heavy weapons to attack the town of Houla, where more than a hundred people were killed. The Independent's Patrick Cockburn, speaking from Damascus, says the government has "pretty tight control" on the capital, but that Syria remains a "mozaic". "As you go to the North... it's a country convulsed by war and by fear of the army" he told the Today programme's John Humphrys. Former British ambassador to the UN Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the programme that the UN Security Council has a "powerful statement" with Russia on board but he admits that the situation is "looking very gloomy at the moment". The most likely scenario in Syria "is the increase of the use of arms on either side and descent into further violence" he said. He believes Kofi Annan "doesn't have the instruments to stop what is going on" and "can't stop either the regime or the opposition from being armed". Get in touch with Today via email
