Mexico to aid bereaved in Juarez
Many of the victims were young and poor, human rights groups say
Mexico is creating a compensation fund for the families of more than 300 women who have been murdered in the northern city of Ciudad Juarez since 1993. Special prosecutor Maria Lopez said the fund would initially have 25 million pesos ($2.2m) in federal aid.
She said the fund would be open to further donations from the Chihuahua State authorities and individuals.
Human rights groups have welcomed the move but stress that many of the cases remain unsolved. They said many of the victims were working mothers employed in factories in the industrial city on the border with Texas. The brutal murders have been generally attributed to serial killers, drug cartels and also domestic violence. Some of the killings are believed to have been sexually motivated. Last month, Ms Lopes called for criminal investigations of dozens of officials working on the unsolved cases, accusing them of mishandling cases or evidence.
Although victims' families complained repeatedly about negligence and ineptitude on the part of local investigators in Chihuahua State, the federal government did not intervene until last year. E-mail this to a friend

Online flirting boosts love firm
OneSaturday.com: single minded
What is love worth? About �2m a year, figures from one of the UK's premier dating agency groups reveals.
OneSaturday, the firm which owns the Dateline, Club Sirius and Elite Introductions businesses, reported 20% growth between May and October in the number of lonely hearts subscribing to its services.
Just as you go to an estate agent to buy a house, there is value in going to an introduction agency to find someone to have a relationship with
Louise HansonOneSaturday And trade is set to increase thanks to a growing acceptance of dating agencies, and the emergence of "online flirting".
"The growth in our subscriber figures reflects partly the success of targeted advertising, and partly decreasing stigma," Louise Hanson, marketing director, told BBC News Online.
"People are more busy and have less leisure time. They recognise that just as you go to an estate agent to buy a house, there is value in going to an introduction agency to find someone to have a relationship with."
Web dating
Those with less serious intentions are logging onto dating websites, such as OneSaturday's own dot.com site, which has attracted 25,000 subscribers.
Company profile - OneSaturday
Formed: June 2000 through merger Single Scenes and Club Sirius
Listed: August 2000 (UK's only listed dating firm)
Turnover*: �2.05m
Profit*: -�1.77m
Owns: Dateline, Elite Introductions, Club Sirius
* figs May-Oct, adjusted for firm's launch in June
"These are not as serious as the planned service offered by traditional dating agencies," Ms Hanson said.
"People join for a shorter period of time, perhaps to meet new friends, or just to flirt. "You can be anyone you want on the internet."
A fact which, while offering certain attractions, poses the kind of security concerns which support the need for formal agencies, Ms Hanson said.
Holiday romance
And OneSaturday's traditional businesses are planning to boost revenue from the UK's estimated 8 million singletons through tapping the desire to mix dating with holidays.
The firm is itself seeking a partner for travel and romance, with a long term relationship a possibility.
Subscriber numbers
Dateline: 28,000
Club Sirius: 9,000
Elite Introductions: 5,000
Company chairman Chris Matthews said: "We are actively developing the business of singles holidays, with a view to building our presence in this market in conjunction with a strategic partner."
The firm is considering expanding online operation to cover financial services, ticket sales and restaurant reservations. The OneSaturday.com portal was on Tuesday offering health advice, financial information, and articles with titles such as "obsessed with threesome", "sex is so noisy", and "initiation: a woman's spiritual adventure in the heart of the Andes".
Dateline's website, which attracts revenues of �8,000 a week, is running at profit, the company said.
Nonetheless company turnover of �2.05m translated into a loss of �1.77m for the six months.
OneSaturday blamed the loss on one-off costs associated with the firm's official formation last year, and its listing on London's small company stock market AIM.

Laddism and the City
Join the City and see the world. Or at least the inside of a bar.
As perks of the job go, having to attend parties where the booze flows freely is a pretty good one.
Laddism and the City go hand in hand and women who work in the Square Mile can find competitive drinking, strip joints and indecent proposals all part of a days work.
Former City worker Julie Bower has just won a sex discrimination case against Schroder Securities while Isabelle Terrillon settled out of court with Japanese bank Nomura, amid allegations of sex discrimination.
Dancing dwarves
One London-based female market reporter attended an oil industry function in Rotterdam.
Held twice a year, traders, brokers and journalists get together to network. Of the 150 people gathered there, only about 15 are women.
The networking begins in a pub at lunchtime and much heavy drinking and several crude Norwegian drinking songs later, some of the assembled throng decided to go to a strip club.
The remaining 40 or so persuaded the female journalist and some of her colleagues to attend a different club.
In the Baya Beach Club in Rotterdam, male and female staff and clientele were wearing bikinis and briefs. At the other side of the large dance floor was a podium.
To the sound of blaring eighties music, about ten bikini and brief wearing dwarves were dancing a routine.
"It was quite funny," she admitted, adding. "I didn't stay very long, I left on my own quite fast in a taxi."
Wanna be in my gang
Those who did leave early or wanted to pause during the all-day drinking sessions were subjected to serious teasing.
You are the sweetest thing in the sugar market
Trader to woman reporter
"You had to be part of the gang. They took networking really seriously. They see it as seriously affecting their profits," she said.
Pressurised group drinking can be part and parcel of working in the City and opting out for either men or women isn't really an option.
Many women working in the City also say they are touched up by both colleagues, contacts or competitors at such events, and think objecting could be bad for business.
Aside from corporate statements about equal opportunities, there are few working in the City who pay any lip service to the notion of equality in the workplace.
One city trader confessed over a few drinks that one of his colleagues had been sacked because she hadn't maintained the glamorous appearance she had presented at the job interview.
Another former foreign exchange trader told one of his colleagues he could not understand how he worked with women - didn't they get upset all the time?
A female analyst at a Japanese bank found that some of her male colleagues could not bear to look at her in meetings as they didn't think she should be there.
City exchanges occasionally arranged journalist visits to trading floors, where the most conservatively-dressed female reporter would elicit jeers, catcalls, whistles and handclaps.
Meat market reports
Market reporters gain an insight into life in the City through their daily interviews with traders and the occasional long lunch.
Many contact lunches generate information, tips, lead to possible scoops. In the City, conversation can revolve around tales of lap dancing in Soho and prostitutes in Thailand.
Many telephone interviews are laden with sexual innuendo, some funny, some naff.
It can be nice, if incredibly irrelevant, to be told you have the sexiest voice in the market, when you ask someone why the FTSE has fallen to a record low.
"You are the sweetest thing in the sugar market," is the refrain that every female journalist covering the softs market - sugar, cocoa, wheat etc - becomes used to.
Not everything can be so easy to dismiss.
One Japanese trader explained prior to a lunch meeting, that he wanted to speak to the male reporter and look at the female reporter.
Asking a civil question and hoping to get a straight answer isn't always easy.
One bond trader suggested a sexual favour might be adequate compensation for his opinions on why UK government bonds had slumped in afternoon trade.
All in a days work? Mmmm.

Man recovers �35,988 from NatWest
By Ian Pollock
Personal finance reporter, BBC News
NatWest is owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland
A businessman from Norfolk has recovered a record �35,987.94 from NatWest after accusing it of charging him unlawful overdraft fees.
The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, had challenged the fees that the bank had levied for bouncing cheques from his company.
NatWest said it was settling the case only because its legal costs were becoming too high.
It is just the latest example of a bank repaying such penalty charges.
Payouts
The businessman is one of a rapidly-growing number of people who have found that their bank has caved in to a claim for a refund of their current account charges, rather than let the case go to court for a full hearing.
It certainly is a spectacular payout
Marc Gander, Consumer Action Group
Campaigners claim that the banks have adopted this strategy because if they were ordered by a court to reveal just how much it actually costs to bounce a cheque, they would be forced to admit that it was in the region of �2, rather than the �25 to �30 unauthorised overdraft fee that is commonly charged.
"It certainly is a spectacular payout," said Marc Gander of the Consumer Action Group (CAG).
"It is the biggest one I know of so far that has been successful."
Small businesses
The businessman in this case - who we shall call Bob - started his windows and conservatory business in 1999.
At times I was paying �2,000 to �3,000 a month in charges. I felt I was being ripped off Bob, Norfolk businessman
Today it employs some 20 people and has an annual turnover of more than �1m, with a healthy bank balance.
But in its early days the company experienced a common problem for small businesses that have just started up: cash flow.
There was little money available to fund the day-to-day costs of running the business, while waiting for customers' cheques to clear.
Bob says that the NatWest, which is owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland, would bounce his cheques or stop his direct debit payments when he tried to draw on money from customers whose cheques had not yet cleared.
Over 28 months, from 2000 to 2002, he was being charged fees on his account almost every week - and at �30 a time.
"At times I was paying �2,000 to �3,000 a month in charges," said Bob.
"I felt I was being ripped off - they were quite happy to take bank charges from us but were not willing to give us an overdraft."
Legal action
Bob changed his bank account to HSBC in 2004, but late last year came across the idea of demanding the charges back while browsing the internet. Using standard letters from the website of the Consumer Action Group, he sent off a first demand in January this year for �24,000 plus �12,000 interest.
With no response he then started a legal action using the government's Money Claim Online service.
A case conference had been scheduled for 11 May.
But out of the blue a cheque arrived last Friday, in full settlement of the claim.
Solicitor's letter
"Our client considers that your challenge to its charges would fail in court," said the letter from NatWest solicitors, Cobbett's of Manchester.
Without admission of liability our client is prepared to settle this matter in full to prevent incurring any further legal fees
NatWest lawyers
But after saying that the charges were fair, reasonable, transparent and levied in accordance with its agreement with Bob, the bank's solicitors threw in the towel.
"Our client does not believe that your claim has any prospect of succeeding," it said.
"Although our client is confident that it will be successful at a final hearing, its legal fees will almost certainly outweigh the value of the claim.
"As such our client must take a commercial approach to such claims," it went on.
Then came the towel.
"Without admission of liability our client is prepared to settle this matter in full to prevent incurring any further legal fees."
All this drew a wry smile from Marc Gander of the CAG.
"The general message is that the banks are paying out substantial sums to avoid going to court," he said.
"This idea the banks are not finding it economically viable to contest the case is just not credible."

Sunshade to look for distant life
The star shade would orbit a million miles from Earth
A huge sunshade a million miles from Earth could help astronomers search for signs of life on planets orbiting distant stars, a study says.
The daisy-shaped "occulter", as it is known, would use a powerful telescope trailing thousands of miles behind.
The shade, described in the journal Nature, would stop light from the planet's star swamping the telescope.
The concept by Professor Webster Cash of the University of Colorado has already received funding from Nasa.
He believes an occulter could be in space within seven years "stalking" Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2013.
"We have proposed to build a star shade to launch a couple of months later and follow it out to its orbit," he said. "We believe this the fastest way to get operational."
Planetary search
Scientists are already searching for planets orbiting stars other than the Sun. Researchers hunt for these extra-solar planets, or exoplanets, using a number of techniques. More than 170 have so far been discovered. Other concepts to look for small planets are being considered
However, all the discoveries have relied on indirect methods of detection. For example, astronomers look for the dimming of light as planets pass in front of their parent stars. Indirect techniques like this mean that only relatively large planets tend to get identified. Astrobiologists, though, are really interested in finding smaller, Earth-like planets which could, in theory, have the right conditions for supporting life. To do this, astronomers need a method of directly imaging the dim planets. Numerous proposals have been put forward, including massive optical telescopes on Earth, or flotillas of space-based telescopes such as the Europe's Darwin mission or Nasa's Terrestrial Planet Finder.
All these schemes are still in development. Sun block
Dubbed the New World's Observer, Professor Cash's design would use a giant 45m (148ft) daisy-shaped, plastic shield in tandem with a powerful telescope, trailing 15,000km (9,300 miles) behind.
The pair would orbit about a million miles (1.6 million km) from the Earth at a position known as a Lagrange point. It's like a cricketer holding up his hand to block out the sunlight
Professor Webster Cash
Here, gravitational effects create a stable orbit with the same period of rotation around the Sun as our planet, effectively allowing the pair to track the movements of Earth.
To search for a planet, astronomers would pick a target star and move the shield in front of the telescope, using thrusters. When the two align, the position of the shade ensures that excess light from the star is blocked, giving astronomers the maximum chance of spotting any small orbiting planet. "It's like a cricketer holding up his hand to block out the sunlight as he tracks a ball in the air," said Professor Cash.
The pair would be held in position to give scientists time to image the planet and analyse its atmosphere for the chemical signatures of life. It could also be used to map entire planetary systems trillions of miles away.
Future mission
The idea has already been given a huge boost by Nasa. The US space agency's Institute for Advanced Concepts gave the proposal $400,000 (�220,000).
Professor Cash and his team have also submitted a proposal to build a shade for the infra-red and visible James Webb Space Telescope.
However, some researchers believe that the Professor Cash and his team may still have some way to go before a star shade blasts into space. "It's an interesting alternative idea but I suspect that there are enormous technical challenges," said Professor Timothy Naylor, an astrophysicist at Exeter University, UK. Potential obstacles include carrying enough fuel for the thrusters and developing a method for keeping the shade and telescope in alignment.
"If you are trying to collect the light from a planet then you are going to have to stare at it for a relatively long period of time to do anything really useful," he said.

India frees jailed Pakistanis
Kashmir will be the main subject of the summit
The Indian Government says it will free more than 400 Pakistani civilians held in various of its prisons, as a goodwill gesture before a summit meeting next week. An Indian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the move reflected Delhi's "positive approach" towards Islamabad. Vajpayee is looking for a more positive approach
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf will begin the three-day summit in Delhi on 14 July.
Earlier on Wednesday, Pakistan released an Indian cyclist, Vikas Singh, who was jailed for three years after entering the country from Afghanistan without a visa.
The Indian spokeswoman, Nirupama Rao, said the prisoners included 229 Pakistani civilians held for violating Indian visa laws and more than 200 fishermen who had strayed into Indian waters. She said there were over 600 Indian civilians currently held in Pakistani jails.
'Positive approach'
Mr Vajpayee has also instructed the coastguard in future to turn back rather than arrest Pakistani fishermen who cross inadvertently into Indian territory, Ms Rao said.
Gen Musharraf is due in Delhi in 10 days
Correspondents say that the issue has long been a sore point in bilateral relations.
"These steps are reflective of our positive approach to all our neighbours, including Pakistan," Ms Rao said.
Other measures included the elimination of tariffs on 50 product lines of Pakistani imports to India, and the introduction of 20 scholarships for Pakistanis to study in Indian technical institutes.
Kashmir emphasis
The Delhi summit, the first between the two countries for more than two years, is expected to focus on the Kashmir dispute.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence in 1947, two of them over Kashmir - in 1947-8 and 1965.
Relations have been tense since the Kargil dispute two years ago, when Pakistani forces crossed the Kashmir Line of Control.
