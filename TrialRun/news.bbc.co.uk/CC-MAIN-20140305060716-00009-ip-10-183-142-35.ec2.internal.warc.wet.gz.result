'Guerrilla artist' Banksy hits LA
By Peter Bowes
BBC News, Los Angeles
A painted live elephant forms part of Banksy's exhibition
Hype and secrecy surrounds graffiti artist Banksy's Barely Legal exhibition in California, which opens later this week.
In typical Banksy fashion, it was not until two hours before the media preview, that I was given the address of the venue for his exhibition. It turned out to be a dingy, swelteringly hot warehouse in an industrial part of downtown Los Angeles. The three-day free show titled Barely Legal - and billed as a "vandalised warehouse extravaganza" - has an overall theme of global poverty and injustice. After much hype and secretive planning, the event opens to the public on Friday following an invitation-only, celebrity launch party. The organisers have said Cameron Diaz, Colin Farrell and Orlando Bloom are all expected to attend.
They will be treated to a familiar, but in some respects, head-scratching display of graffiti-inspired artwork. I'm not sure what the point of having an elephant in a warehouse in downtown Los Angeles is

A 37-year old Indian elephant has been painted, from head to tail, in a floral pattern reminiscent of an old fashioned living room or a British pub. The animal is made to stand in a makeshift living room, complete with sofa, chandelier and decorated with wallpaper in the same pattern.
Banksy, as ever, was not on hand to discuss his creation, but it is understood that the elephant, blending into the background, is meant to represent the big issues in life, such as poverty, that some people choose to ignore. "I don't feel particularly incensed at the fact that he painted a live animal," said journalist Sorina Diaconescu.
"But I think he's treading a pretty thin line and it's part of his charm."
The meaning of the stunt appeared to be lost on some observers.
"I've still got to get my head around that one," said Jason Bentley, a commentator on US public radio.
Banksy targeted Disneyland earlier this week
"I'm not sure what the point of having an elephant in a warehouse in downtown Los Angeles is."
"I'm not sure that Banksy's work carries a particular message," added Ms Diaconescu. "The medium is the message and in this case just the very fact that there is an elephant in the room, the proverbial elephant in the room, is what he's trying to say, period."
There is nothing cryptic about the exhibit that features giant cockroaches clambering over photos of a scantily clad Paris Hilton along with copies of her CD. The display features a graffiti style message, "Thou Shalt Not Worship False Icons." Earlier this month Banksy smuggled 500 "alternative" versions of the heiress's album into record shops in the UK.
Further stunts
"I just love his approach and his style and his wit," said Mr Bentley.
"It's really very simple and profound at the same time, that's what is clever about it. In a very public arena you can take away something really significant."
The exhibition also features film footage of Banksy's latest stunt, when he placed a life-size replica of a Guantanamo Bay detainee in a theme park ride at Disneyland. The operation was caught on camera, covertly, and has been edited into a short film.
As for more stunts in Los Angeles, during the exhibition weekend, Banksy's people are coy.
"Keep your eyes peeled."

Galileo satellite phones home
Giove-A will demonstrate key technologies
British space engineers have received signals from the pioneer spacecraft for Europe's satellite-navigation system.
Giove-A is communicating with its ground station, they say, and all systems are performing well.
The 600kg Galileo satellite was lifted into orbit on a Soyuz rocket from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on Wednesday. It paves the way for a network of 30 satellites that will give Europe its own version of the US Global Positioning System (GPS).
Giove-A was built by the small British company, Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), a spin-off from the University of Surrey.
Engineers are operating the spacecraft from SSTL's control room in Guildford, Surrey. THE SAT-NAV FUTURE
Navigation for navigation's sake will not drive applications
Uptake pushed forward by services that add value to data
Huge potential for internet-linked services run off mobiles
E.g. finding a restaurant, and directing you to nearest ATM
Multimedia delivered to tourists' mobiles as they walk around
'Guardian angel' services will locate separated children
Possibilities are endless; mobile firms already brainstorming
Database and billing companies planning for large markets
Galileo puts UK on map
Q&A: Europe's Galileo project
Max Meerman, a principal engineer at SSTL, said on Wednesday that they had received signals from the spacecraft and all was going to plan. "The second solar panel is deployed and the power system is operating nominally," SSTL said on its website.
Over the coming days, engineers will check out the satellite's payload, which is designed to test key technologies to be deployed by future Galileo satellites. Giove-A's first task is to secure use of the frequencies allocated by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) for the Galileo system. Once the payload is activated, the Galileo signals broadcast by Giove-A will be analysed by ground stations to make sure they satisfy the criteria.
Giove-A will also test atomic clocks for the Galileo system, which is expected to be complete in 2010.
The 3.4bn-euro (ï¿½2.3bn; $4bn) project will give civilian users a satellite navigation and positioning service that is 10 times more accurate than the alternatives available today. While public signals from GPS are already widely used by the likes of sailors, mountaineers and motorists, the US military reserves the right to limit its use or switch it off for security reasons.

Learning the Montessori way
Children are encouraged to learn independently
In the early part of the 20th Century, an Italian doctor called Maria Montessori developed a new approach to teaching, where children took responsibility for their own learning.
In a Montessori classroom, children work largely on their own with special equipment designed to develop their sensory, numeric, language and practical skills.
By Katherine Sellgren
BBC News Online education staff
Lorna Mahoney is passionate about Dr Montessori's method, so much so she spent five days of her honeymoon in Barbados observing Montessori schools.
Lorna Mahoney: A Montessori teacher for 12 years
Lorna had been teaching and training Montessori teachers for nine years when three years ago she identified the demand for a Montessori school in her home area of Walthamstow, north-east London.
"I had parents knocking on my door asking 'Are you the lady who's setting up a school?' even before I'd found a building," Lorna recalls.
Now the school is up and running for 20 pupils aged two to five and, from September, the school will keep on children beyond that age.
The children are all in class together, despite their different ages.
Pupils are encouraged to develop everyday skills, such as using tongs
"Dr Montessori felt that in life, you don't just exist with those the same age - you'll mix with people of different ages, sexes, religions and so on," Lorna explains.
When pupils arrive, they greet their five teachers by shaking hands and then start work by picking up any piece of equipment they choose.
Some read a book in the corner, others play with a jigsaw or with beads.
There is no formal start to the day with teacher telling pupils what they will be doing that day - instead the initiative is with the child. Gently does it! Each bead is carefully picked up with tweezers
And there is no black board in sight. "I'm directing them to learn rather than telling them to - I'm not teaching them," says Lorna.
"We're not here to impress them and tell them clever things - so the balance is very different.
"Teacher is not central to the activities at all - there's no desk, for example. But in an 'ordinary' school, she's in charge."
Hands-on
Much of the focus of Montessori is on the sensory.
With only 10 spindles, the child knows if he has got it right
"Dr Montessori said: 'Nothing comes to the intellect which isn't first in the senses'," says Lorna.
"Nothing in the classroom is put there by accident, it's there for a reason, not just to entertain a child but it has a purpose."
And so a globe with the land marked out in sand paper helps children understand the difference between land and sea.
Pupils learn to add up by putting spindles into the right slot, numbered one, two and so on.
A concrete set of 1,000 beads helps get the message across
A set of beads, divided into one, 10, 100 and 1,000 introduces children to the concept of decimals.
"With the beads, they get a muscular impression of the difference between a unit of one, 10, 100 and 1,000 with their hands.
"After a while they see that the 1,000 is just lots of 100s joined together," says Lorna.
SATs
In contrast to government targets, Lorna refuses to put children under pressure to achieve.
Children carry on playing independently outside
"I make no guarantees - I won't say your child will be reading by the time they leave, because there is no average, there is no average child."
When Walthamstow Montessori school eventually expands into a primary school, Lorna says she will ask pupils to sit the national curriculum tests, SATs.
"But we'll do them in a Montessori way - there'll be no build-up, no pressure."
Moving to mainstream
One of parents' biggest concerns is how children will react when they leave a Montessori environment and head into a mainstream school.
Children have mats to play on, setting out their own space
Lorna is adamant that the skills of independent learning serve the children well.
"It's not as hard as it would be the other way round," says Lorna.
"Our children are very motivated. We get fantastic feedback from schools because they've got the independence to get on with something else when they've finished a piece of work - they don't just sit there, because they're active learners having had the responsibility for their learning handed over to them at a young age.
"But a child who comes into this environment where there is so much freedom will find it hard because they won't be as independent."
Early excitement
Montessori has proved more popular in other countries - such as Canada, the United States, Italy, Sweden and Ireland - than in the UK.
But, as Lorna recalls, it could have been a very different story.
"In the early part of the 20th Century, a member of the aristocracy saw Dr Montessori's work in Italy and was so excited, they suggested bringing her over here so that all British infants could learn in this way. "But then World War II broke out and it never happened - it's such a shame." See also:

Oldham confirm Penney as manager
Penney joined Darlington in 2006 after five years in charge of Doncaster
League One side Oldham have confirmed Darlington boss Dave Penney as their new manager on a two-year deal.
Penney replaces Joe Royle, who took temporary charge of the Latics in March after the departure of John Sheridan. On Tuesday, former Everton boss Royle announced he was to leave Boundary Park after failing to win in eight games in his second spell in charge of the club. Penney resigned as Quakers boss earlier on Thursday after almost three years in charge of the administration-hit club. The Latics will not owe Darlington any compensation because of the League Two side's financial situation. Oldham managing director Simon Corney told the club website: "We are delighted to be able to welcome a manager of Dave's calibre to Boundary Park. "He is a very professional and thorough person who ticked all the boxes and who has an excellent track record." Penney guided Doncaster from the Conference to League One, the club's highest league position for 50 years. 606: DEBATE
Have your say on Penney's appointment He left in August 2006 and was appointed Darlington boss two months later. Penney's Darlington have faced an uncertain future since the club went into administration and had 10 points deducted in February. The Quakers were in contention for a promotion place this season before having their points taken away. Penney told BBC Radio Manchester he would speak to the outgoing manager as a priority. "I'll pick Joe Royle's brains," he said. "I'll do the same with Tommy Wright, Lee Duxbury and Tony Philiskirk as well as anybody that I can to get some feedback from and find a lot more about the club quite quickly. "I'm going to have a chat with everyone. I played with Tommy at Doncaster so I know him quite well and he doesn't live far from me." Meanwhile, Royle has dismissed suggestions he may have stayed at Oldham beyond the end of the season. He told BBC Radio Manchester: "I came to Oldham specifically to see the club through nine games to buy time to find a manager. "They needed breathing space to have a look at CVs of the managers in the frame and I was very much a caretaker. "There is always an 'if' factor in football and if we had won six games in a row and gone into the plays-offs, who knows? But I only ever came for nine games."
