Poverty increasing in Mongolia
An official survey of living standards in Mongolia shows that more than one-third of the country is living in poverty. The survey set the poverty line at an income of less than eighteen dollars a month in the capital, Ulan Bator, and slightly lower in rural areas, where the cost of living is less. The new figures show that while poverty has increased in urban areas, it has decreased slightly in the countryside.
The head of the National Statistical Office, which conducted the survey, said the gap between rich and poor had grown.
Correspondents say that a poor harvest last year coupled with a sharp drop in the price of Mongolia's two main exports -- copper and cashmere -- mean that the situation is unlikely to improve soon.

Russian youths 'hound UK envoy'
Mr Brenton complained of harassment by Nashi activists
The UK embassy in Moscow has complained to the Russian foreign ministry about harassment of Britain's ambassador by a youth group with links to the Kremlin.
The embassy told the BBC that Russian officials pledged to investigate.
Members of Nashi, which supports President Vladimir Putin, objected to Ambassador Anthony Brenton's attendance at an opposition conference in July.
"We are picketing the residence of the ambassador," said Vladimir Katasonov, a Nashi spokesman.
"One of our activists is staying every day there," he told the BBC's World At One programme.
'Anti-fascist' campaign
Mr Brenton attended an opposition conference called Another Russia on 11-12 July, which was billed as an alternative to the G8 summit in St Petersburg.
Among the opposition activists there was Eduard Limonov, leader of the National Bolsheviks - regarded by Nashi as a fascist organisation.
Mr Katasonov said Nashi wanted Mr Brenton to apologise for having shown support for the opposition groups.
Nashi, which says it is working to combat fascism in Russia, was launched in April 2005. It claims to have thousands of followers.
Another of its stated goals is to thwart any pro-Western mass movements of the kind which took power in Georgia and Ukraine in recent years.
The British protest comes amid strained relations between Russia and the UK over the poisoning of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London.

'Healthy lifestyles' wane in US
The number adhering to all five "healthy habits" has fallen The number of US adults following a healthy lifestyle has fallen in the last two decades despite increasing public health campaigns, a study shows.A review of two studies stretching back to 1988 found the proportion of obese adults has crept up to over a third. Levels of exercise also fell, as did consumption of fruit and vegetables. The American Journal of Medicine study found those with health problems were no more likely to follow a healthy lifestyle than their fitter peers. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina compared two large-scale studies covering the period 1988 to 2006. During those 18 years, the percentage of adults aged 40-74 years with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 rose from 28% to 36%. If we want all Americans to achieve the health benefits of a healthy lifestyle, then all members of society must take action
Dr Steven GalsonActing US Surgeon General
The number of people exercising three times a week or more fell from 53% to 43%, while the number of people eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day fell by nearly 40%. At the same time, smoking levels remained the same and moderate drinking slightly increased. Overall, researchers found, the number of people adhering to all five "healthy habits" - including maintaining a healthy weight and stopping smoking - decreased from 15% to 8%. What nowThis drop "demonstrates that the amount of emphasis by the current health system on prevention and healthy lifestyles may be insufficient," wrote lead author Dana King. "The implications of the decreasing rates of healthy lifestyle habits include the possibility of an upswing in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and increase in the number of aging persons with disability and decreased quality of life due to the burden of chronic disease."

But he added that research showed individuals could be persuaded to adopt healthy behaviour in middle age, and more effort should be focused on this. Dr Steven Galson, the acting US surgeon general, said: "There is clearly a lot of work that needs to be done. "If we want all Americans to achieve the health benefits of a healthy lifestyle, then all members of society must take action including parents, educators, community leaders, government as well as the individual. "Together we can help Americans understand the severity of obesity, the efforts being made to address it, and how to maintain a healthy weight and live a healthy lifestyle." Professor Alan Maryon-Davis, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health commented: "This is a wake-up call for the UK. What happens in America often happens over here a few years later."

Diary of a Somme marcher: day one
Neil McGurk is retracing the footsteps of his grandfather and two great-uncles on a march marking the 90-year anniversary of the Battle of the Somme. 27 JUNE: SERRE TO AUCHONVILLERS
I'm here as a member of the Royal Army Medical Corps, the RAMC. There are different units represented here, various different infantry units and a couple of artillery officers. Neil McGurk (left) and William Clark, a stretcher-bearer at the Somme
For breakfast we had porridge, bacon and fried tomato. We've been eating various stews, such as carrot, ham and potato stew, bully beef; and we've been issued Huntley and Palmer biscuits to go in our packs, as emergency rations. We set off today and I was carrying a large pack, a small pack, a water bottle, a PH helmet which is a type of gas mask and a stretcher. It's pure coincidence that my great-uncle Corporal William Clark was also a stretcher-bearer at the Somme.
We're carrying a fair bit of weight, our uniforms are made of wool. I arrived on Sunday - it constantly rained that day and now it's still cloudy and an awful lot warmer, so it's starting to get a bit warm marching. Day two: emotion at Thiepval
Neil prepares for the march
We only did about three miles today, but each day we're doing longer and longer - and on Friday we're doing about nine miles.
The local people are taking more and more interest the longer we're here. They find it a little bit strange, seeing all these unusually dressed British people marching around their villages. There are also quite a few British people here already who didn't necessarily know about the march. They came here to find graves of relatives. I've come across people from Northern Ireland, England and Wales just in the couple of days I've been here.
'What the hell are we doing here?'
My grandfather and great uncles would have thought "What the hell are we doing here?" It's strange - this area of France just looks like English farmland to me - except for the number of cemeteries. Of course when they were here all the area we're marching in would have been covered in trenches and redoubts, the landscape would have been pretty blasted, there would have been very few trees left. 21st century Tommies have a cuppa after a hard day's march
So I'm seeing a very different landscape to them.
We've been stopping at military cemeteries along the way laying wreaths at each one. People who know the battlefield have been making us aware as we pass of points [of interest], when we're in No Man's Land, when we're behind the German lines, when we're behind the British lines. Our march can't follow exactly the front line because it runs through various fields.
We're now at a place that the English refer to as Ocean Villas which is a Tommy corruption of Auchonvillers. We're sleeping over here tonight and we're setting off from here tomorrow for Thiepval. We'll be marching up to the monument [the largest British war memorial in the world] where my great uncle is mentioned. That will be very strange, because I've found out so much about him recently.

Red Nose Day 2011 in Hampshire
With Red Nose Day fast approaching on Friday, 18 March, the entire nation is gearing up to do something funny for money!The aim is simple. To have a laugh, raise tons of cash and transform lives across Africa and the UK. And it works! All the money raised and donated by the public goes directly towards projects that transform people's lives across Africa and at home in the UK. Celebrity challenges
Craig David joined the celebrity Red Nose Desert Trekkers
Three Hampshire celebrities embarked on the toughest physical challenge of their lives. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills from Eastleigh, Southampton-born RnB star Craig David and Winchester-based broadcaster Peter White attempted to cross one of the world's most inhospitable deserts in Northern Kenya to raise cash for Comic Relief. The team of nine celebrities covered 100 km (62 miles) through the Kaisut Desert in five days. More on the Red Nose desert trek
Meanwhile BBC South weather presenter Reham Khan took part in the first Spinnaker Tower "rib walk" for Comic Relief. Weather presenter, Reham Khan walked a 'rib' of the Spinnaker Tower
Reham climbed out of the crow's nest near the top of the 170m (547ft) tower, dropped to the longest high 'rib' of the Portsmouth landmark and walked along its edge. She completed the challenge in under five minutes. Watch Reham's Rib Walk
challenge. BBC Radio Solent's Alex Dyke kept his feet firmly on the ground to take part in BBC Local Radio's stand up challenge.
UK and AfricaAcross the UK your cash can help to provide comfort for isolated older people and help to give young carers their childhoods back. In fact it's likely you're never more than 30 miles from a Comic Relief supported project. Last year, Southampton-based support and counselling service for teenagers, No Limits, received £115,000. "Sarah", 25, turned to the charity during her teenage years when she had an abusive and achoholic mother. She later suffered from depression and debt. She said: "They really help me to find somewhere to stay and be safe. Whenever I've just needed to talk, they've always been there for me. "I'm more of a grown-up now, it's thanks to the help from No Limits," she added. In Africa, your money helps to restore people's sight, to protect families from deadly malaria, to give an education to children whose lives have been torn apart by war, and so much more.

1971: Britain allowed to sell arms to S Africa
The Commonwealth Conference in Singapore has ended with a compromise over the wording of the Declaration of Commonwealth principles.
Talks centred around Britain's proposal to sell arms to South Africa, despite a voluntary United Nations embargo on arms sales.
Other African nations are also opposed to the idea.
The original draft of principles, submitted by Zambia, was seen as an attempt to put Britain under a moral obligation not to go ahead with the deal. It would have bound members to give no assistance to nations practising racial discrimination.
But the final draft, agreed by all 31 members, simply condemns racial discrimination and follows the British prime minister's view that Commonwealth nations should be responsible for their own policies.
"When we already have a maxi United Nations, I see no point in establishing a mini United Nations," said Edward Heath, British prime minister.
The declaration states countries are allowed to deal with discriminatory nations if, in their own judgement, they believe their help is not aiding racial discrimination.
However, despite signing the declaration, President Kaunda of Zambia said: "We have some power to retaliate against any power which sells arms to South Africa".
"It is the beginning of a long fight," he added.
African nations are against the sale as they feel it strengthens the country and its apartheid policies.
It was feared the issue could cause the break up of the Commonwealth Association with Britain gaining support from Australia and Canada.
But it is believed the prime minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau, was instrumental in persuading the African nations to agree to the rewritten declaration and so saved the Commonwealth conference from collapse.
Britain is expected to sell ships and naval equipment to South Africa to help them protect the route through the Cape of Good Hope against an influx of Soviet naval activity nearby.

In Context
In the end the South African government did not make any significant orders for arms.
In 1977 the UN Security Council upgraded their stance to a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa.
The UN arms embargo was lifted in May 1994, shortly after Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president.

2000: UK tidal wave of web users
One in four British homes is now using the internet according to figures released by the government.
A new survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that in the first quarter of this year there were six-and-half million households accessing the internet, which is double the total for the same period last year.
This is the first time this information has been included in the ONS's Family Expenditure Survey which is published quarterly.
The survey - of 7,000 households - reveals that internet usage varies according to location, wealth and age of families.
Although more than twice as many people in Northern Ireland are logging on than last year, the figure is still 11% of the total, compared to 24% in south-east England.
Homes with families are also more likely to use the web as 35% of those with two or more children will have web access, compared to just one per cent of single pensioners.
A Cabinet spokesperson has outlined government schemes to ensure that this "digital divide" does not get any bigger.
Key to their strategy is the opening of 700 IT access centres across the country by next year and internet access for all UK schools and libraries by 2002.
Net facts
The software for computer networks was first developed by scientists in the 1960s. The first wide-scale network in the UK - JANET - was set up for academics in 1984.
In 1998 nearly 10% of British households had internet access. By June 2002 that figure had risen to 40%, along with 95% of businesses and nearly all schools.
An e-Envoy office has been part of the British Cabinet office since September 1999. It has responsibility for co-ordinating and developing all aspects of internet culture and commerce.
In July 2005 the number of people in Britain signing up for broadband internet connections overtook those applying for the traditional dial-up links. Falling prices have led to a rapid increase in broadband connections. By July 2005 they accounted for 50.7% of all internet connections in the UK.
