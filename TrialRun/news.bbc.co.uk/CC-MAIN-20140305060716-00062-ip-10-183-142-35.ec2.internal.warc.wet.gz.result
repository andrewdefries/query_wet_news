Profile: Lee Hsien Loong
Lee Hsien Loong was in the army before entering politics at age 32
Ever since he was a boy, Lee Hsien Loong knew he was destined for high office.
As the elder son of the founder of modern Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, he grew up watching his father transform the city-state from a post-colonial backwater into South East Asia's richest nation.
Often criticised for being aloof and humourless, the younger Mr Lee has inherited his father's intellect and is seen as a safe pair of hands to take over as Singapore's third prime minister.
But many Singaporeans are anxious to know whether he will maintain the island's conservative status quo, or bring fresh faces into the government and release its tight grip on society.
High achiever
Born in 1952, Lee Hsien Loong studied at Cambridge and Harvard, gaining a first-class degree in mathematics and a masters degree in public administration.
He then joined the military, quickly rising through the ranks to become brigadier-general. In 1984, at the age of 32, he followed his father into politics as a member of the ruling People's Action Party. Again he made rapid progress. He was elected to the party's Central Executive Committee in 1986, and was appointed deputy prime minister in November 1990.
Later he was also given the title of Minister for Finance and chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
Lee Kuan Yew will have a heavy influence on his son's leadership
He played a key role in outgoing prime minister Goh Chok Tong's cabinet, and spearheaded many of the reforms aimed at re-igniting the economy.
But Mr Lee's rise to the top has not always been plain sailing. He has also faced tough personal challenges along the way. His first wife died of a heart attack in 1982, shortly after giving birth to their second child. He married businesswoman Ho Ching three years later, and has since had two more children.
Then, two years after his appointment as deputy prime minister, he was diagnosed with lymphoma. Even this did not deter his ambition. When the cancer went into remission, he took on the extra roles of finance minister and central bank chairman. Family ties
He faces fresh challenges, too, in his role as prime minister. Jobs are disappearing, while Singapore's birth rate stagnates and its population ages.
Mr Lee also faces criticism over his family's virtual monopoly over Singapore's power structure.
The elder Mr Lee will still have an important role to play in government, as an officially appointed "minister mentor" to his son.
And the new prime minister's wife, Ho Ching, also holds considerable power as the executive director of a powerful government investment arm, Temasek Holdings.
Temasek owns stakes in Singapore Airlines and Singapore Telecommunications - whose chief executive is none other than Mr Lee's brother, Lee Hsien Yang.
But one of Lee Hsien Loong's most urgent challenges will be to act on the increasing calls for liberalisation.
Mr Lee's father may have built Singapore into a rich and prosperous nation, but in the process he imposed tight controls over everything from the freedom of the press to the chewing of gum. Singaporeans want a change from what is often seen as an over-protective nanny state, and many hope a change of prime minister will bring a new era in personal freedom.
So far, however, Mr Lee looks set to keep the status quo largely intact. His chosen cabinet has few new faces, and he has not made any concrete announcements of change. But in the past, Mr Lee has referred to the need for modernisation.
In a speech earlier this year to Singapore's influential Harvard Club, he said: "Whether it is a ceiling leak, a mosquito nuisance or a troublesome neighbour, usually the first question which people ask is: What will the government do about it? Nanny should not look after everything all the time."
It is time for the government to "cut the apron strings", he said. As prime minister he has now got the power to do just that, if he chooses.

Can I increase my borrowing?
Just because someone will lend you money, that doesn't necessarily mean you can afford to borrow it! HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH?
Before taking on any new borrowing, think carefully about whether you will be able to afford the new repayments on top of your existing ones and think about what would happen if your circumstances changed. To help you do this, draw up a budget taking into account how your income and spending are likely to change over the lifetime of the loan. Also look at how much you will pay back in total (multiply the monthly payment by the number of payments). You might be surprised!
Re-run our Debt Test as if you had already taken out the loan. Do the results suggest you'll run into problems?
Calculate the effect of a change in interest rates on your mortgage.
Think carefully before you borrow more to try to get out of a problem. A new loan may appear to help for a time, but will make matters worse if you run into problems repaying that loan too. Check out budget and loan calculators to understand the real impact of your borrowing.

CONSOLIDATION LOANS
Consolidation loans are a single loan taken out to replace your other debts, but are they the best option? Taking out a consolidation loan when you are already in severe debt might not be the best option for you. Think about:
Cost: Is the interest rate very high? Will the new loan really save you money?
Security: Is the loan secured against your home? If so, you could risk losing your home if you fail to keep up the payments on the consolidation loan
Other existing debts: Make sure the consolidated loan covers all your existing debts (except those which have a lower APR than the consolidation loan). Otherwise, you could find yourself having to pay back loans you had forgotten about at a time when you are already stretched paying back the consolidation loan.
New debts: Once you've consolidated your loan, don't build up new debts elsewhere. Cut up your credit cards so that you can't use them.

SECURED AND UNSECURED LOANS
What is the difference between a secured and an unsecured loan?
A secured loan means that you borrow a sum of money and put up something of value as security - usually your home. If you do not keep up the payments, the lender can sell the item used as security, even if that means leaving you homeless.
With an unsecured debt, if you don't keep up the payments, the lender can take action in the courts to get the money back. You will usually be ordered to pay off the loan in regular instalments set at an amount the court decides you can afford. The lender can use a range of other measures if you do not make the payments in line with the court order.
A secured loan is usually cheaper than an unsecured loan, because lenders run very little risk of not getting their money back. An unsecured loan will generally cost you more, but there's less immediate danger of losing your home if you can't keep up the payments.

NHS pays out to hepatitis victims
The payouts will be made to patients infected before 1991
Patients infected with hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood by the NHS are to receive at least �20,000 each in compensation. Health Secretary John Reid said patients who have gone on to develop advanced forms of the disease will receive another �25,000.
People who contracted the disease from infected patients are also in line for compensation. However, the families of patients who died from the disease before 29 August 2003 are to be excluded. Under the scheme, payments will only be made to patients who were infected with hepatitis C before September 1991 and who were alive on 29 August 2003.
Long campaign
People infected with hepatitis C through contaminated blood products have campaigned for more than 20 years for compensation. More than 1,000 people who contracted the disease in this way have already died. Providing assistance is the right thing to do
Health Secretary John Reid
Thousands of people received HIV and hepatitis C contaminated blood in the late 1970s and early 1980s, although some cases may have occured even earlier. It is believed that every haemophiliac who received regular blood infusions around this time was infected with hepatitis C. Many also contracted HIV. Some other patients regularly receiving blood products, or others simply getting a one-off transfusion, were also left infected.
Heat treatment of blood to kill the viruses was finally introduced in 1985. Donated blood is now screened using modern techniques for both HIV and hepatitis viruses.
Mr Reid said compensating these patients was the right thing to do. "I felt it was important that English hepatitis C patients should receive these payments on compassionate grounds.
"It's clear that providing assistance is the right thing to do.
"I believe that these are fair and reasonable payments and I hope that they will help alleviate some of the problems people who have been affected in this way are experiencing."
He said the payouts would not affect these patients' social security entitlements. Mr Reid will set up an independent body to administer the scheme. It is expected to be up and running by April and is due to start authorising payments soon afterwards. "We will be working with organisations such as the Haemophilia Society and Hepatitis C Trust on this to help ensure the procedures are as user friendly as possible," Mr Reid said. Scheme criticised The Haemophilia Society criticised the amount of money on offer and the fact that the families of those who have already died would not receive compensation. "The government's decision to exclude families who have been bereaved as a result of hepatitis lacks compassion and is a bitter blow to those who, surely, have suffered the greatest harm from this tragic treatment disaster," said Karin Pappenheim, its chief executive.
Harriet Bullock, whose husband Ken died five years ago after contracting hepatitis C from contaminated blood, also criticised the package. "I'm pleased the government has recognised the issue of hepatitis C among the haemophilia population and the misery that contaminated NHS blood products has caused. "But I don't understand why they have excluded the dependants of those who have died."

Just who will pay for social care?
By Branwen Jeffreys
BBC News health correspondent
Many people have to use their savings to fund care
We are all living longer - but the future is far from rosy.
More of those retirement years are being spent in poor health - reducing our independence and increasing the need for care.
On average a women now spends more than 11 years of her old age in poor health - for men it is more than eight years. And that is not the only problem.
Our population is ageing, with pensioners becoming a much bigger segment of society. It is estimated that tens of thousands of family homes are sold to meet the costs of care
That means fewer younger people in work paying taxes to fund our health and social care systems. This is the double whammy that lies behind the Wanless report.
How can we afford the growing burden of care for a larger number of elderly people, and crucially, who should foot the bill?
Big problems
Charities campaigning for the rights of the elderly say the current situation is confusing and unfair.
The needs of an elderly person can be complex and hard to untangle into neat categories of nursing or social care
In theory, care is free in the whole of the UK if the primary need is for healthcare. Other types of care are loosely banded together as personal care - otherwise known as social care. But the distinction between what is nursing and what is not is often fiercely disputed because it determines who pays. In 1999 the Royal Commission on Long Term Care for the Elderly recommended that personal care should be provided free.
While in Scotland free personal care has been introduced, it was rejected by the government for England. That means an older person needing care faces means testing. Variations
Each local authority has its own criteria for assessing what service should be provided free and at what point an individual has to contribute. For personal care in a residential setting the threshold in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for having to pay towards your care is �20,500 and the value of your home can be counted.
Failing to qualify for funding from either an NHS budget or social services budget often leads to a lifetime of savings being spent.
It is estimated that tens of thousands of family homes are sold to meet the costs of care. In Wales the Labour Party has done a u-turn on a manifesto promise to provide free personal care at home. While measures to reduce the impact of charges have been promised, that leaves the situation the same as England. In Northern Ireland all personal care is means tested under the age of 75. Above the age of 75 some personal care services are free. MS patient
Many families face a bewildering maze of regulations. The needs of an elderly person can be complex and hard to untangle into neat categories of nursing or social care.
A recent high profile case has shown how difficult it can be to navigate the system. In January of this year 65-year-old Maureen Grogan won her fight at the High Court against Bexley NHS Care Trust for full NHS funding of her care.
It was too late to save the family home which had been sold to pay the care bills.
Mrs Grogan is immobilised through multiple sclerosis, and is doubly incontinent. But NHS assessments had only led to partial funding of her care in a nursing home. The case has left other trusts reviewing the way they assess cases.
Consultation
According to the Department of Health, new criteria for who qualifies for NHS funding for care are to be put out to consultation in April.
Charities like Help the Aged, and Age Concern will be lobbying hard for clearer guidelines. It is against this background that Sir Derek Wanless is making his case for substantially increased funding for the elderly.
When he conducted a similar review of the NHS for the Treasury it led to an historic increase in funding for the health service.
This time his report has been funded by the independent think tank The Kings Fund. That could allow the government to quietly ignore its findings but some campaigners are cautiously optimistic. The recent White Paper on out of hospital care signalled a shift in priorities to give a greater importance to providing care to people in their own homes.
The Care Services Minister Liam Byrne is also canvassing views on all kinds of social care ahead of the government's spending review in 2007. It is being described as a once in a decade chance to undertake a fundamental review, and Derek Wanless has agreed to join. E-mail this to a friend

Aquarium's fish dishes condemned
Visitors can sample both the beauty and taste of fish
The UK's largest aquarium has been criticised by an animal rights group for serving seafood in its restaurant.
Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) said the policy at Cheshire's Blue Planet Aquarium was "bizarre".
It said it would begin a campaign to have fish taken off the menu at the centre in Ellesmere Port.
But its owner Deep Sea Leisure has refused to back down, saying it was standing up for customer choice.
Peta director Dawn Carr was "shocked"
Dawn Carr, director of Peta UK, said she had been "shocked" when one of the pressure group's members alerted her to the situation.
She said: "Serving fish on the menu at an aquarium is simply bizarre.
"These places purport to be places where one can learn about, and admire, fish.
"How can anyone stand in awe of these glorious, fascinating creatures and then head over to the cafeteria and stick a fork in them?"
But Deep Sea Leisure said it had no plans to remove fish from its menus. Spokeswoman Sarah Champness said: "We attract a large range of different visitors and they have the right to free choice which is why we are keeping fish on the menu.
"We also provide meat and vegetarian dishes and are sure we have something for everyone."

Michael Schumacher escapes Felipe Massa penalty
It was an incident-packed race - Schumacher
Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher will not be punished for his part in an incident with Ferrari's Felipe Massa during the Canadian Grand Prix.The seven-time champion was referred to the stewards after he made contact with Massa near the end of the race. The incident damaged the front of Massa's car, with the Brazilian needing to come in for a new front wing. Renault's Robert Kubica and Toro Rosso driver Jaime Alguersuari were handed reprimands for two separate incidents. Kubica was reprimanded for "a dangerous entry to the pits" while Alguersuari was referred to the stewards following his collision with Williams driver Rubens Barrichello. Schumacher and Massa were battling with six laps to go when the German appeared to cut across the Ferrari as he returned to the racing line at Turn 12.
Smedley on Schumacher incident
The back of the Mercedes clipped the front of the Ferrari, knocking Massa's front wing, with the Brazilian having to take evasive action and briefly going across the run-off area. Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn, speaking before the ruling, defended his driver. "Michael didn't have a lot of grip, he was on tyres that were very badly grained, so I'm not aware of anything unusual that happened," added Brawn. "It might be true that he braked much earlier than Felipe was expecting, but that was the point at which Michael, with the tyres he had, had to brake. "I don't think there was any malice in what happened." Ferrari engineer Rob Smedley said: "I think that Michael had to possibly brake a little bit early as his tyres were not great - much earlier than Felipe was expecting and he drove into the back of him." It was not the only incident involving Schumacher in the race, as the German also went wheel-to-wheel with Kubica when coming out of the pits on lap 13. "The first stop was perfectly timed, so it was looking quite promising," said Schumacher, who ended up in 11th place. "Then I had a puncture on the front right tyre after I got together with Kubica, and that obviously decided my race." In a race that was decided on tyre strategy, Brawn said the Kubica incident proved costly as Schumacher had to pit again two laps later.
ANDREW BENSON'S BLOG
This was McLaren's second one-two in as many races and suddenly a world championship that only two races ago looked in danger of becoming a Red Bull benefit is fizzing with competition and uncertainties
"It was a shame because he got out in front of Kubica, and was looking OK," added Brawn. "But we could see from the data he had a right front puncture and it was correct, because when we called the car in there was a slash on the tyre. "Because of the puncture we got out of phase with the tyres, and we took a chance on whether the option [softer] tyre would last, and obviously it didn't. "It was a pretty optimistic move, but we figured if we went for another pit stop after that then we weren't going to get there." It compounded a miserable weekend for Schumacher, who was overtaken at the very end by the Force India duo of Vitantonio Liuzzi and Adrian Sutil to finish out of the points. Apart from a retirement in Malaysia and ending up 12th in Monaco after being penalised 20 seconds for an illegal overtaking move, this was his worst result of the season.
Highlights - Canadian Grand Prix
The 41-year-old, back in the sport after three years in retirement, also had his worst qualifying session of the campaign and started 13th on the grid. Schumacher's team-mate Nico Rosberg ended up in sixth place in an incident-packed race after qualifying in 10th. "Sixth place was probably the best result that we could have achieved today, so I'm pretty happy," said Rosberg. "It's been a difficult weekend with a poor qualifying performance yesterday due to the tyres not working properly and I was unlucky on the first lap today to lose so many places from the chaos in front of me."

New Zealand's Craig Barrett took silver while Tim Berrett of Canada finished third.Deakes was also triumphant in the 20km walk on Sunday."I'm lost for words," he enthused. "It's a great feeling to win gold and to win two at the same games is a dream come true."Deakes' performance was all the more impressive given that the athletes had to endure a 40-minute thunderstorm midway through the race.Controversially disqualifiedEngland's best medal hope Steve Hollier found the pace hard going and finished in sixth.Redhill-born athlete Mark Easton was controversially disqualified after just over an hour of the race.The 39-year-old was well adrift at the back of the field when the judges showed him a third and final red warning for failing to keep both feet grounded.Australian Liam Murphy was also disqualified for the same reason while Deakes and bronze medallist received red cards during the race.
