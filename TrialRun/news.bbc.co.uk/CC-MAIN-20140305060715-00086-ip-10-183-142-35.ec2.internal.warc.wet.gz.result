Chinese village still in Mao era
Mao Zedong still dominates Nanjie village
By Francis Markus
BBC correspondent in Nanjie, China
China's Communist Party is moving ever further from its revolutionary roots to embrace the country's new capitalist elite. But not everyone is travelling in the same direction. Nanjie village, in the central province of Henan, collectivised its agricultural production and industry in the mid 1980s - when the rest of the country was doing the opposite, introducing market reforms put forward by former leader Deng Xiaoping.
It continues to be run on Maoist egalitarian lines and has become something of a tourist attraction because of its staunch adherence to the values of the past.
On the TV set in the local souvenir shop, a karaoke video is playing. But the Chinese characters changing colour across the screen as the music plays are not the usual sentimental love lyrics. They are a song paying homage to Chairman Mao. He is everywhere in this place
In Nanjie's main square, a bus-load of tourists gathers around their guide at the foot of a giant white Mao statue, flanked by portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.
The local military brigade provides a pair of sentries to guard the statue around the clock. But it quickly becomes clear that this place is about more than preserving revolutionary icons. It is about trying to hang on to at least some old Communist values in a fast-changing society. And about finding a way around the seemingly intractable economic problems of rural China.
Tourist trap
A jostling crowd of village residents lines up to collect their regular quota of eggs. They do not need to pay a cent for them. They just take along their little red ration food distribution booklets. "They also get meat and cooking oil and duck eggs and other commodities," says one resident.
Of course there are those who support what we're doing and those who oppose it
Wang HongbinNanjie party chief It is the same for accommodation in modern tidy rows of apartment buildings, and for health care. No wonder bus loads of tourists are coming to see.
"Mao's slogan 'to serve the people' is really put into practice here. It's not just empty rhetoric," says one woman tourist from Chairman Mao's home province of Hunan. It all sounds almost too good to be true - and in a sense it is.
There is a whole cluster of factories and flour mills, which make Nanjie village look more like a small industrial town. They now make up the core of its collective economy. But most of the work is done by migrant workers. They outnumber the village residents by about 9,000 to 3,000.
And the migrants do not get anything like the same deal as the locals.
"It's true that the migrant workers' pay and conditions are not as good as the village residents," says Nanjie's party chief Wang Hongbin.
"But they want to come here to work and we're giving them employment opportunities, so we're benefiting the country and the people."
Changing times
Even with all that low cost labour, the village has recently been going through tough times as its main products like instant noodles and beer face stiff competition.
But ideologically, Mr Wang, who has become something of a cult personality, insists things are hale and hearty. Mao is out of fashion elsewhere in China
He deftly brushes off any suggestion of a clash between the collective lifestyle of Nanjie and Deng Xiaoping's free market reforms.
"Of course there are those who support what we're doing and those who oppose it," says Mr Wang. "That's quite normal.
"But those who oppose us are also helping us by posing questions for us to answer, which are beneficial to our development."
In the surrounding countryside, it is clear that the Nanjie approach has had some influence.
Several villages have adopted a similar model, even though large-scale re-collectivisation of the economy remains a Maoist dream. China's leaders have failed to give a significant boost to rural living standards. And with capitalists now formally allowed to join the Communist Party, the leaders seem much more preoccupied with wooing the country's emerging rich elite.
Places like Nanjie, which embody the old style collective values of the Maoist era, may be out of fashion, but they are likely to keep a certain appeal.

'Train surfing' teen loses legs
A teenager has lost both his legs after jumping onto the roof of a train with a group of friends and falling off.
The 14-year-old boy, who has still to regain consciousness after having both lower limbs amputated, hurt himself near a Cheshire train station on Friday.
He and his friends were jumping on the outside of the freight train to ride it for a short distance - a practice known as "train surfing".
Police have launched an investigation into the accident.
British Transport Police said: "At about 1930 on Friday, police and ambulance services attended Northwich Train Station in Cheshire where a 14-year-old local youth had been involved in an accident with a slow moving train carrying stone."
The boy's parents were said to be at his bedside on Monday night, at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester where he is being treated.
Anyone with information is urged to contact British Transport Police on 0800 405040.

Leeds sign England hooker Steve Thompson from Brive
Hooker Steve Thompson formerly played in England at Northampton
England's World Cup-winning hooker Steve Thompson has agreed a two-year contract with Leeds to return to the Guinness Premiership next season.The 31-year-old, who played for England against the Barbarians on Sunday and is part of their summer tour squad, has been at French club Brive since 2007. "It was a big decision for me to come back and I have got more nerves than I did about going to France," he said. "But I am looking for a fresh challenge and Leeds is exactly right for me." Thompson spent 10 years at Northampton before temporarily retiring with a neck injury in early 2007, only to return to playing later that year after taking further medical advice. He returned to the England side last summer on the tour of Argentina and now has 55 caps to his name. He is a world-class player who is still performing at the top of his game Leeds head coach Neil Back
At Headingley Thompson will link up with his World Cup-winning team-mate Neil Back, who alongside director of rugby Andy Key kept Leeds in the Premiership against the odds this season. "As a club, we are delighted to have signed a player of the calibre of Steve Thompson," said head coach Back. "He is a world-class player who is still performing at the top of his game and he sees the move to Leeds Carnegie as a chance to improve even further. "Importantly, Steve also has all the right characteristics to be part of our squad. We are building a strong pack here and Steve will be a great addition to that. 606: DEBATE

"We already have Andy Titterrell and Phil Nilsen at the club and the competition for the hooking spot highlights the strength in depth we are now building within the squad." Thompson, who said he has "nothing but admiration" for what Key and Back have achieved at Headingley, has been talking to new England squad member Hendrie Fourie about the Leeds set-up. "I have been picking his brains about how the club operates and talking about the guys," Thompson added. "I have been watching some videos and I just want to make sure I am up to speed when I report for pre-season training." Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?
