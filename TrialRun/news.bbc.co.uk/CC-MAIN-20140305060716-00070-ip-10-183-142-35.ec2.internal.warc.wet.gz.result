Baseball card goes for $1.1m
Mona Lisa of baseball trading cards
A baseball trading card has been auctioned online for $1.1m.
The card, not much bigger than a large postage stamp, dates back to 1909 and depicts Pittsburgh Pirates player Honus Wagner, considered by many to be baseball's greatest all-round player.
It was sold by the eBay online auction house.
The card, widely regarded as one of the rarest and most coveted among collectors, is the finest known specimen of about 50 Wagner cards known to exist from a 1909 set. The winning bidder, whose identity is being kept secret, will pay $1.265m including a 15% buyer's premium.
Collector's dream
Bidding for the card started at $500,000 on 5 July, and a total of 13 bids were made.

"We've had several very high-priced items, but unfortunately because of the sheer volume of items we don't have a list of highest auctions," eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said. "But it's safe to say that this Wagner card is in the top two or three."
The card's previous owner, Michael Gidwitz, a sports memorabilia collector from Chicago, bought the card for $650,000 in 1996.
"It has always been the most desirable item that a baseball card collector could aspire to own," Mr Gidwitz said.
The Flying Dutchman
Previous owners have included ice hockey star Wayne Gretzky, who bought it in 1991.
Previous owner Gidwitz: 'Something to aspire to'
The card is known as the "Gretzky example" and has been described as the Mona Lisa of trading cards.
The card was part of a promotion by the American Tobacco Company in 1909 in packets of its Piedmont cigarettes.
But Honus Wagner, nicknamed "The Flying Dutchman," was adamantly anti-smoking and the cards were quickly withdrawn.
Only 50-60 cards were ever printed, and of those only a handful were sold to the public.

UK mobile phone auction nets billions
The internet on the move on the phones of the future
The auction for next-generation mobile phone licences in the UK is over, leaving Chancellor Gordon Brown with a �22.47bn ($35.4bn) windfall.
Result after 150 rounds
Licence A:
TIW �4.3847bn
Licence B:
Vodafone Airtouch �5.964bn Licence C:
BT �4.03bn
Licence D:
One2One �4.003bn
Licence E:
Orange �4.095bn
The five winners are TIW, a US-Canadian company backed by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, and the four companies that currently run mobile phone services in the UK - BT Cellnet, Orange, One2One and Vodafone Airtouch.
The auction was over when cable company NTL, backed by France Telecom, dropped out of the race.
The move had been widely expected after NTL called for a 24-hour time-out in the auction. In a statement the company said that "other strategies" offered better values - a hint that it might try to merge with or take over a rival operator.
Record result
The auction result leaves market leader Vodafone with one of the strongest of the mobile phone licences, while BT Cellnet has to make do with a weaker frequency. The
price ... was too high. It seemed more reasonable to withdraw, in the interest of our shareholders and customers.
NTL owner France Telecom
The best licence, though, had been reserved for a newcomer and was snatched by TIW.
Thirteen bidders had driven up prices well beyond the original estimate of a total auction value of �5bn.
The �22.47bn windfall is equivalent to �400 per person in the UK. However, no major spending spree is expected. Instead, the government plans to pay off national debt with the proceeds. The money may not all be forthcoming at once as the licence winners have the option of paying in instalments over the 20-year licence period, with half paid up front. Orange takeover war
The result will trigger a take-over war for Orange, which was recently bought by Mannesmann of Germany but must now be sold after the German firm was bought by rival Vodafone Airtouch.
There has been speculation that France Telecom may try to buy Orange as an alternative route to taking over a licence, and merge it with its NTL customer base.
Telefonica of Spain is also expected to express an interest.
High-profile companies which have fallen by the wayside as the stakes have risen include Spectrum - a consortium including Virgin and Tesco - Irish telecoms group Eircom, Australian company OneTel as well as Telefonica.

Sterling takes a pounding
By Katie Hunt
Business reporter, BBC News
Britons are likely to be making fewer trips to the US.
This time last year, bargain-hungry shoppers headed across the Atlantic to New York's swanky department stores in droves.
With the pound worth more than $2, they sought out cheap iPods, designer clothes and gourmet restaurants.
But few will be flying to New York to do their Christmas shopping this year.
Sterling has been one of the biggest victims of the global financial meltdown - losing more than a quarter of its value since July.
It has now fallen below $1.50 for the first time since 2002. The pound is also at its weakest level against the euro since the currency was created in 1999.
See the pound's performance against the dollar
"People really aren't going to want to make international holidays," says Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.
'Worst recession'
Sterling's problems are linked to the wider economic picture.
The UK is expected to have the worst recession of all the G7 rich nations and this means investors think UK assets will perform poorly.
"Like everywhere, the UK economy is slowing down," says Daragh Maher, senior currency strategist at French investment firm Calyon. Sterling has been like an elastic band that had been stretched too far and when it gave, it was vicious
Daragh Maher, Calyon
"But the perception is that we have over-borrowed more than other countries, so the payback will be greater."
Falling interest rates put further pressure on sterling.
Last week, the Bank of England delivered a shock one-and-a-half percentage point cut in UK interest rates to 3%, the lowest level since 1955.
Economists expect rates to fall further.
It means that investors get a lower yield on pound deposits and sterling-denominated debt, making them less attractive.
This could pose a problem for the government, as it is expected to issue debt to pay for the banking bail-out.
Falling fast
It is unusual for a currency to fall so far, so fast.
Only twice in recent history has sterling fallen by such a degree.
On 16 September 1992, the pound was withdrawn from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, triggering a fall from around $2 to $1.40.
Iceland's financial crisis has made it more affordable for travellers.
Sterling fell by a similar degree in 1980 as a commodity bubble burst.
Mr Maher says that the pound at $2 was significantly overvalued and puts the currency's long-term intrinsic value at around $1.60.
"It's been like an elastic band that had been stretched too far and when it gave, it was vicious," he says.
Mr Derrick at Bank of New York Mellon says it is feasible that the pound could hit $1.40 in the near future and one euro could be worth more than 85 pence.
Winners
The fall in sterling could benefit manufacturers as the weak pound makes UK-made goods more competitive on international markets.
Similarly, overseas visitors may view the weak pound as reason to visit the UK.
"The recent fall in sterling and the approaching Olympics in 2012 give us a tremendous opportunity to promote Britain's attractions as a destination to the world, " says Tom Wright, chief executive of Visit Britain.
But, with the world entering an economic downturn, demand for UK exports and holidays may dwindle, as hard-up consumers opt to conserve their cash.
Comfort
For those planning to take summer holidays abroad, there is some comfort.
While the pound has weakened against most major currencies, particularly the dollar, euro and yen, it has held up against others.
Sterling has risen 10% against the Australian dollar since the end of June, as falling commodity prices have undermined the Australian economy.
And if you really want to maximise your hard-earned pounds, Iceland's financial crisis has made the notoriously expensive country more affordable.
The pound has gained about 25% against the Icelandic crown since the end of June, when Iceland's economy began to hit the rocks.

Could you save Sarah's life?
By Jane Elliott
BBC News website health reporter
Sarah and her family are trying to recruit donors
Sarah Thompson has acute myeloid leukaemia and desperately needs a bone marrow transplant within the next two weeks. Because she is mixed race she knows her chances are slim as there is a shortage of ethnic minority donors.
But Sarah, a teacher, is convinced she has a match somewhere and says everybody should register.
"I was first diagnosed in May 2004 and was initially told that I had a good chance of fighting my leukaemia, even though by the time I went to the doctors with my symptoms it was already far advanced. "My sister, mother and I get dizzy and feel faint when we are tired or hungry anyway, and I did not realise these were also the symptoms for leukaemia.
If I try to think about it too deeply it is just mind blowing. We are just dependent on other people's selflessness
Sarah Thompson
"It wasn't until I also started noticing the bruising, which had no other cause, that I started to worry there was something wrong. "I had also had a number of colds, and the night before I went to the doctor I had a very high fever.
"The doctor I saw was a locum and he immediately spotted there was a problem. "If I had waited even a few more weeks I would have probably died.
"I went to my hospital in Lewisham and collapsed while I was waiting to have my blood taken. I did not come out of the hospital again for another six weeks.
"They told me I had acute myeloid leukaemia and in the same breath they told me that I would also be infertile from the chemotherapy. "The leukaemia was so far advanced they could not wait to harvest my eggs and I had to start treatment immediately.
"I had my first round of chemotherapy and went into remission and then had my next three rounds."
Chemotherapy effects
Sarah says the real problem began once the chemotherapy had started working.
"It kills good cells as well as the bad cells and you become 'neutropenic' and have no immune system or protection against infection. "You have to avoid certain foods and contact with people, the nurses must wear gloves and aprons at all times. Sarah's condition was spotted late
"Visitors are kept to close family only and you are not allowed any contact. So when you are feeling at your lowest you can't even hug your partner!
"I usually got at least one infection after each round of chemo. Some have been very serious and worrying." Sarah had a relapse and was warned she needed a bone marrow transplant as she would relapse again. "So then my husband Mark and my family started the search for a donor. I knew that because I am mixed race it would be more difficult. I have only one sibling, Laura, and was told she was not a match.
Register progress
"If you are from a white heritage you have a one in five chance of finding a donor. This drops to one in 100,000 if you are from any of the ethnic minorities, because there are so few black and mixed race people on the register.
"It is scary waiting for a transplant and it is frustrating.
"It is bad enough to have to beat cancer once but for it then to come back and to face it coming back again and again is devastating.
I am relying on someone coming forward, and waiting is just so scary
Sarah Thompson
"You go through all the chemo and they tell you that the next stage is to put you on the register for a transplant, but then you are told that there is no-one for you. "To avoid becoming completely depressed I try to turn a negative into a positive. "We have put over 100 people on the register and I feel we have made a difference.
"If I try to think about it too deeply it's just mind blowing. We are just dependent on other people's selflessness.
"If everybody put themselves on the register, I might not be in this position, but I am relying on someone coming forward and waiting is just so scary. "I have done all I can on my own - now I need someone else's help."
Just hoping
Sarah says she has not given up hope that a match will be found.
"I feel sometimes that I have been chosen to go through this to help raise awareness and even when I find my match we will not stop campaigning for people to register.
"The doctors have told me that if they cannot find a match that they will try stem cell transplant and while I am well they are going to harvest my cells in preparation.
"But I am hoping this is not going to be necessary as it is not supposed to work as well. I am just hoping that they will find a match.
"I can't keep on having chemo because it is highly toxic and has such a harmful effect on the body long term.
"In the meantime I must just wait for this unknown person to come forward.
"Please anybody reading this come forward and register. I feel I deserve a break and some good news. For the last two years I have been through such an emotional roller-coaster."

Social care revamp needed 'to make system fairer'
By Nick Triggle
Health reporter, BBC News
Care funding is currently means-tested
The number of people being excluded from social care in England will continue rising unless there is a major revamp of the system, experts warn.The King's Fund think-tank pointed out rationing had already started with many councils only helping the most in need. It said the best way to limit the problems was to create a partnership between the state and individuals where both contributed to the cost of care. It comes as ministers are discussing changes to the funding system. Home help and residential care for the elderly and adults with disability is currently means-tested so that those with assets of more than £23,000 do not get state support.
WHERE THE PARTIES STAND
Labour - Put forward three proposals - all of which involve the state providing a basic level of care which would be topped up by either personal contributions, a voluntary insurance scheme or compulsory levy. The third option - dubbed a death tax - is said to be favoured by ministers
Tories - Proposed an £8,000 voluntary insurance model to cover residential care costs. Now drawing up plans for a voluntary scheme to cover domestic care, such as help washing, eating and dressing in the home
Lib Dems - Initially supportive of free personal care - like Scotland has introduced - but now want a "partnership" whereby state pays some and individual tops this up. Open to compulsory levy
Q&A: Social care
But the increasing demands on councils because of the ageing population have led them to place even tighter restrictions so that only those with the most severe problems get help. It means the numbers being supported have actually fallen slightly in the past four years despite a 5% rise in the number of over-75s. The King's Fund last looked at the social care system in 2006. The report, led by former government adviser Sir Derek Wanless, proposed what was then considered a radical shake-up of the system. It suggested a partnership between the government and individuals whereby the state would meet at least two-thirds of the cost of care. This report updates that by looking at the latest data on the ageing population and the state of the public sector finances. It has revised the state contribution down saying it should only meet 50% of the costs. This model of care would allow about 1.8 million people to get access to care by 2026 - 700,000 more than the current system would - because councils would be able to afford to provide help to those with less severe needs. However, despite the partnership model bringing in billions of pounds a year in personal contributions, the cost to the state would still rise to £15.5bn by 2026. The King's Fund said this would make it more expensive than leaving the status quo in place. 'Increasing demand'But Anna Dixon, acting chief executive of the think-tank, suggested it was a price worth paying. "The current social care system often falls short of meeting the needs of the people who rely on it and will not be able to cope with increasing demand for services as the population ages. "The people who stand to benefit most from our proposals are those on moderate and middle incomes who are heavily penalised by the current system." The government said it would be publishing its own plan soon. Last summer it set out three options - one of which was also a form of partnership, albeit where the state provided a smaller proportion of funding than the King's Fund has put forward. Councillor David Rogers, of the Local Government Association, said: "We cannot wait any longer to fix the system which provides adult social care. "The combination of insufficient funding, increased demand from an ageing society and escalating costs is already placing an immeasurable strain on services."

Building work resumes at Har Homa
Work on the Har Homa site ceased after infrastructure was laid
Building work resumed at the controversial Israeli settlement of Har Homa in the Arab district of Jebel Abu Ghneim in east Jerusalem on the eve of the Israeli general election.
No work has been done on the site since the infrastructure was put in place in 1997.
The initial work sparked fierce Palestinian demonstrations throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip and a 19-month breakdown in the peace process.
According to politicians, the timing of the new phase of construction - which involves work on building 150 new houses - had nothing to do with the polls.
Announcing the start of digging, Housing Ministry spokesman Moshe Eilat, said "this was a decision of the companies, not the Israeli Government, and has nothing to do with the elections."
Contractors have also denied that the companies had been asked to restart the work by the government.
But Palestinians have accused the incumbent Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of speeding up development to draw right-wing voters in Monday's elections.
"This is Mr Netanyahu's determination to destroy the peace process," said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
Labour leader Ehud Barak, favourite to become prime minister in Monday's elections, has not said he would stop the building at the site, but is considered more likely to continue the peace process than Mr Netanyahu.
The Palestinians want to establish the capital of a future independent state in east Jerusalem, territory which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Six Day War and later annexed.
But the establishment of Har Homa would mean that Jerusalem's Arab population would be completely encircled by Jewish settlements.

Ian Brady seeks public hearing
Ian Brady on his way to his trial in 1966 By Peter Gould
BBC News Online
The Moors murderer Ian Brady wants a public hearing to determine whether he should still be detained in a mental institution.
In a startling move, the killer is pressing for his case to be reviewed in open session, rather than behind closed doors.
Brady, who is now 64, is a patient at the high security Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside.
His lawyer, Alan Hazlehurst, has made the request for an open hearing to a mental health tribunal in Liverpool.
The tribunal will consider whether or not Ian Brady should be discharged
Alan HazlehurstBrady's lawyer He told BBC News Online: "Ian Brady has a legal right to a tribunal, and has a right to a hearing in public.
"It would have to be open to the press, and he would have a right to attend and give evidence."
Hunger strike
Brady was jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of 12-year-old John Kilbride, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17. He later confessed to killing 16-year-old Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, who was only 12. Brady has been a hospital patient since 1985
He was moved from prison to the high security hospital in 1985.
For the past three years, he has been on hunger strike, and the hospital authorities have been feeding him through a plastic tube.
Two years ago he went to the High Court to demand the right to die, but doctors were told they could continue to keep him alive against his wishes.
That hearing was held in private.
Now Brady is taking advantage of the provisions of the Mental Health Act.
Any patient detained in a mental hospital has the right, once a year, to ask for a hearing to determine whether he or she can be discharged.
If the patient does not make such a request, their case is automatically reviewed every three years. Outcry
It is this legal safeguard, to ensure that mental patients are not overlooked, that Ian Brady has seized upon.
Partners in crime: Ian Brady and Myra Hindley
Mr Hazlehurst says it is his intention to call independent evidence from psychiatrists and psychologists who have examined his client.
"The tribunal will consider whether or not Ian Brady has a mental disorder, and whether he should be discharged or should remain in hospital," he said.
But the possibility of Brady ever being released appears extremely remote. He was moved to the hospital because doctors believed he had a serious mental disorder. In any event, there would be a public outcry if there was the slightest possibility that he might be set free.
Brady has repeatedly told the BBC he has no desire to be released, and says that unlike his accomplice Myra Hindley, he will never seek parole.
Mother
He says his only wish is to be allowed to end his captivity by starving himself to death.
Lesley Ann Downey was one of Brady's victims
Recently, Brady was taken under guard to a Manchester hospital to visit his mother, who is now in her 90s and seriously ill. A mental health tribunal would be bound only to consider the question of whether he should be discharged from Ashworth. He would have the right to give evidence in person.
Given the preparation needed for such a tribunal, it is unlikely it could be held before the beginning of next year. Last week, his lawyer and two MPs had a meeting with the hospital authorities to discuss complaints by patients.
"Mr Brady and a substantial number of other patients have expressed concern about their treatment and their conditions," said Mr Hazlehurst.

What makes one child a bully and another a victim ?
Thousands of children all over Britain are bullied, usually at school
The gang who tormented Kelly Yeomans probably never intended her to die. But what is it that drives a group of youngsters to make someone's life a misery? And are some children more vulnerable to being "victims" than others?
Kelly spent months enduring "fatty" taunts, was subjected to practical jokes and pelted with eggs, margarine, cakes and even stones. Dozens of people left flowers outside Kelly's home after her deathHurt and anger
Pauline Hasler, director of the Anti-Bullying Campaign, says: "Some bullies are horrible because of their own inadequacies and frustration.
"They take their hurt and anger out on another human being. A bully is fully aware when they pick their victims that they will not fight back."
She says the reasons for victimisation are numerous: "It could be their weight, race, hair colour, anything. Sometimes it is actually down to jealousy.
"If you tell someone they are fat or ugly enough times they will begin to believe it, which often leads to anorexia and bulimia."
The helpline of the Anti-Bullying Campaign receives 16,000 calls a year. Last year, 10 British youngsters committed suicide because of bullying.
Safety in numbers
According to Ms Hasler, bullying "is usually a gang activity, rarely one-on-one. Bullies get safety in numbers."
She says the perpetrators are often the products of dysfunctional families and their behaviour may mimick their father, mother or elder siblings. Ms Hasler supports the decision to prosecute Kelly Yeomans' tormentors and says: "It's about time the law took a more serious view. Some children are fully aware of what they are doing. They are getting off on a high on what is unacceptable."
The victims Alan Mclean, principal educational psychologist with Glasgow City Council, conducted a survey of schools in the Strathclyde area in 1995 and found bullying was "endemic" in the area.
According to Dr Mclean, becoming a victim of bullying is a "lottery" but he says there are three main factors:
Isolation: introverted, shy or "self-contained" loners are more vulnerable.
Being Different: this includes ethnic minorities, people with ginger hair, glasses, acne, pronounced accents, weight problems or especially high or low IQs.
Soft Targets: bullies often spot vulnerable targets by their lack of assertiveness. This is often shown by under-reactions or over-reactions, such as crying.
He found that in only 14% of cases did the intervention of teachers or parents persuade them to stop. But in 75% of cases, bullies stopped because they "became more aware of the effect their behaviour was having and were able to put themselves in the victim's position." Kelly Yeomans was found dead at her home in DerbyThe bullies
But Dr Mclean says the typecast portrayal of a bully as big, dim and oafish was inaccurate and simplistic.
The ring-leaders of the gangs of bullies others "are often very bright and can be very powerful, manipulative and charismatic individuals. They often end up as leaders of industry and government," he says. Gang members, however, are often "dragged along ... under peer group pressure and are often bullied themselves."
The intimidation
Vicky Wood, who runs a counselling and information service in Leicester called Open Door, says that bullying occurs not only in schools, but children's homes and among neighbours as well. It can take the form of name-calling, physical attacks, offensive graffiti, poison pen letters and exclusion from peer groups. Victims often have dinner money or shoes stolen, a form of extortion known as "taxing".
The victims exhibit symptoms ranging from truancy, running away from home, drug or solvent addiction and even attempted suicide.
Ms Wood says bullying has always been around but she refuses to believe that it is part of human nature and says: "Once adults start behaving properly and showing better examples to their children then we will begin to see an end to bullying."

It's all Greek to Harry Potter
Andrew Wilson had a one-year deadline for the translation
A teacher has translated the first Harry Potter book into classical Greek.
Classics teacher Andrew Wilson, from Bedford, says it is the longest text to have been translated into the ancient language in 1,500 years. Mr Wilson spent a year on the project, which was commissioned by the publishers. The book will come out later this year, along with the Irish Gaelic version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Mr Wilson said: "I read an article in the Daily Telegraph which said they were looking for someone to translate into classical Greek. On a whim, I wrote to the publisher and said 'I can do that' as a kind of joke."
"I think what the official line is, is that it can be used in schools to encourage people to learn Greek. Having got kids reading English, JK Rowling is quite keen to have them reading Latin and reading Greek.
"I've really no idea who's going to read it, but a lot of my classical friends said they were looking forward to it."
Pupils were bemused by the translation at story time
He said his model for Harry Potter has been Lucian, a writer from the 3rd century AD, who is "not much read in schools".
"I suppose he thinks of himself as a philosopher, with science fiction thrown in."
Mr Wilson said writing the book had its challenges.
"Everybody asked me, what's the Greek for Quidditch? "What's the Greek for bludger and snitch and all these other technical terms that JK Rowling has invented?"
'Pomegranate tree'
The classics teacher had to use descriptions of the characters and the unique vocabulary used in the book in his translation. In his work, Harry Potter is translated as "warrior goblet", While red-haired Ron Weasley's name is translated as "pomegranate tree" The classics teacher showed the ancient Greek version for the first time this week at Scott School in Bedford, where he read to the children.
One of the pupils told BBC Look East: "I didn't know what he was saying, but I did recognise a couple of words and it did make us laugh."

Town turning green in oil trial
The biodiesel is made at the Argent Energy plant in Motherwell
Residents and schoolchildren in a Norfolk town are taking part in a trial of a "green" oil that can be used in boilers to heat homes.
The town of Reepham is taking part in the 12-month scheme to use fuel made from used vegetable oil and animal fat for heating and hot water. Researchers from the University of East Anglia (UEA) are leading the trial. They say if it succeeds it could reduce the carbon footprint of almost two million homes in the UK and Ireland. 'Viable option'
The local primary and secondary schools are among 30 properties involved in the project. The fuel being used is a biodiesel manufactured by Argent Energy, in Scotland, from used vegetable oil and tallow, which is blended with conventional oil by Pace Fuelcare, in King's Lynn, Norfolk, before the company delivers it to the properties. The blends have a similar or lower carbon footprint than natural gas. The UEA says the aim of the project is to prove that renewable heating oil is a viable option. The children are enthusiastic about cutting carbon emissions - and we have energy monitors for each class

Project manager Dr Bruce Tofield, from the UEA, said: "This is a major initiative in developing lower carbon heating options for millions of properties, especially in rural areas, which depend on oil-fired heating." Lisa Cook, head teacher at Reepham Primary School, said: "The children are enthusiastic about cutting carbon emissions and we have energy monitors for each class. "They are genuinely thrilled to be taking part in such a significant experiment." Jeremy Hawksley, director general of the Oil Firing Technical Association (Oftec), one of two bodies that represent the industry in the UK, said results from the trial were extremely encouraging so far. He said: "Having a liquid biofuel that is interchangeable with domestic heating oil means that around 1.9 millions households in the UK and Ireland will be able to use renewable technology to heat their homes, with very few modifications to their existing heating systems."

'Selective' knife figures blasted
Police forces are using stop-and-search tactics to seize knives from youths
Downing Street has been rebuked for manipulating knife crime statistics for political ends.
Sir Michael Scholar, head of the UK Statistics Authority, said officials pleaded with No 10 not to release "unchecked" and "selective" numbers.
But they were over-ruled by ministers eager to show a crackdown on knife crime in England was working.
The Lib Dems said ministers had been "caught peddling dodgy statistics". The Tories called for the full figures.
Mr Scholar's comments came in an official letter of complaint to the Permanent Secretary at 10 Downing Street, Jeremy Heywood.
In a letter to Sir Michael on Friday evening, Mr Heywood acknowledged that "insufficient attention" appeared to have been given to the objections of statisticians to the release of the information.
In a press release issued on Thursday, Number 10 and the Home Office said there had been a sharp fall in the number of teenagers caught carrying knives in England and hospital admissions due to knife wounds in areas targeted by police.
They pointed to a 17% fall in serious injuries and deaths across nine police force areas over the past six months as well as a 27% fall in hospital admissions.
The Home Office was repeatedly asked by news organisations for the raw data behind the claimed falls in knife carrying but officials declined to provide the figures, saying the full information would only be published "in due course".
'Political manipulation'
Sir Michael told BBC Radio 4's PM that government statisticians had asked Number 10 not to publish the data until March when the knife crime campaign would have ended and it could be properly checked and published in its proper context.
Asked why Downing Street had acted against the advice of officials, he said: "The government was making a series of announcements about this issue and felt its case would be put better if it could publish these numbers."
I hope you will agree that the publication of prematurely released and unchecked statistics is corrosive of public trust in official statistics
Sir Michael Scholar, UK Statistics Authority
Mark Easton's blogIn full: Watchdog's letter
He said the decision to publish the figures was tantamount to a leak, which was "rather odd because it's made with the authority of the home secretary and with Number 10 Downing Street's authority".
The government had "breached" the code governing official statistics by publishing just "one part" of the numbers.
"There is a code designed to prevent political manipulation and my authority was set up to police this code," he told BBC News.
"I am sorry to say the Home Office and No 10 broke these rules."
Sir Michael has written to leading civil servants in No 10 and the Home Office to express his concern about the robustness of the figures and the manner in which they were released.
'Corrosive'
In his letter, he said the figures were not due for release "for some time" and that officials at the ONS - which the Authority oversees - tried to stop their release.
The figures were provisional, he said, and had not passed through the "regular process of checking and quality assurance".
Sir Michael said he had been told by Office for National Statistics (ONS) officials that "officials or advisers in No 10 caused the Home Office to issue a press release" containing the information.
"I hope you will agree that the publication of prematurely released and unchecked statistics is corrosive of public trust in official statistics and incompatible with the high standards which we are all seeking to establish," he wrote.
The figures covered the period since the Home Office launched a �2m campaign in June to crack down on knife carrying in 10 "hotspots" including London, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands.
The 'Tackling Knives Action Programme' saw increased use of stop-and-search powers and advertising campaigns warning about the dangers of carrying knives and the penalties for doing so.
The figures suggested the number of people stopped and searched each month had risen by 10,000 since June and those found carrying knives were three times more likely to be sent to prison.
At the time, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith welcomed the fact the crackdown was "making a real difference on the ground" but said more needed to be done.
The figures in question were released on the same day that Gordon Brown joined campaigners, including relatives of victims of knife crime, to launch a new drive against knife violence.
'Culture of spin'
But with question marks now raised about the data, the Tories called for ministers to explain themselves.
"The knife crime epidemic is a tragedy that has claimed too many young lives," said shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve.
"If government ministers have sanctioned the selective and manipulative spinning of these statistics, it is reckless and irresponsible."
Labour should immediately publish the full figures so that we can see the truth
Dominic Grieve, Conservative home affairs spokesman
The UK Statistics Authority was created last year as part of a move to give ONS its operational independence and to improve trust in public statistics.
"Labour should immediately publish the full figures so that we can see the truth," Mr Grieve added.
For the Lib Dems, shadow home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said "the culture of spin" seemed to be alive and well at the heart of government.
"If ministers want the British people to trust anything they say, statistics must be made completely independent of government," he said.
"Unfortunately it still seems that ministers are prepared to put courting the headlines ahead of checking the facts."
The BBC's Mark Easton said the episode was damaging for trust in crime figures and official statistics in general.

We use iPods in class
You wouldn't think that you'd be allowed to use your iPod in class but that's what a class in a school in Coventry can do.In fact, they were given the iPods by the school, to help them with their lessons.Here's their story."Our class is getting the chance to keep an iPod for two whole years. We think they are good to use in lessons because they help us with our maths and our grammar. It is like holding a mini computer in your hand. We use them when we are in lessons and when we get stuck. We can look on our iPods at our desks instead of going to a computer. iPods in the classroom
Take them homeEven when we are far from our school, with our iPods, we can still do our homework. The iPods are not just for research, they are also for fun and games. You can do anything on the iPods, they are fantastic! We were very excited when we found out about the iPod project because we get to take them home. Really jealousYear 6 are disappointed because they did not get any iPods. Our friends from out of school are really jealous. They all want to come to our school. Come back to us and we will keep you up to date on what is going on."
