Cuba offers direct talks with US
Raul Castro said Cuba was not "desperate" to hold talks with the US
Cuban President Raul Castro has said he is ready to hold direct talks with US President-elect Barack Obama, but played down any quick breakthrough.
Mr Castro described Mr Obama as an "honest man", but said his election had given rise to "excessive hopes".
He was speaking a day after Cuba marked the 50th anniversary of its revolution.
Mr Obama has indicated he will ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba but maintain the 46-year US trade embargo on the island. Speaking on state TV on Friday, President Castro repeated his previous assertions that Havana was ready for direct talks with the US "without intermediaries, directly".
"But we are in no rush, we are not desperate," he stressed.
Mr Castro said Mr Obama, who is due to take office on 20 January, could "do a great deal, could take positive steps".
"A president is coming in who has raised a lot of expectations in many parts of the world, hopes that are too high, I think," he added.
Muted celebrations
On Thursday, people across Cuba celebrated the anniversary of the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power.
Mr Obama has said he wants to meet Cuban leaders
Speaking from the same balcony where his older brother, Fidel, declared victory on 1 January 1959, President Castro predicted the revolution would survive another 50 years.
The festivities were muted as Cuba struggles with big economic challenges and the aftermath of three hurricanes.
The frail health of Fidel Castro also dampened the mood of celebrations, says the BBC's Michael Voss in Havana.
The 82-year-old has not been seen in public since undergoing major surgery almost 18 months ago.
Reacting to the anniversary, a White House spokesman said the US continued to seek freedom for the Cuban people.

Friday, 27 July, 2001, 17:11 GMT 18:11 UK
Chris Morris: Brass Neck
Chris Morris has emerged as one of the most astute, and controversial, satirists of his age. With credits such as On The Hour, The Day Today, Jam and Brass Eye under his belt, his brand of humour is frequently dark and uncomfortable, as Andrew Walker of the BBC's News Profiles Unit explains.
There can be no doubt about Christopher Morris's abilities. Performer, writer, journalist, musician, he is at the centre of a loose group of cutting-edge artists which includes Steve Coogan, alter ego of Alan Partridge, the playwright Patrick Marber and Doon Mackichan of the Smack The Pony team.
But, while the others are showered with plaudits, Chris Morris has ploughed his own controversial furrow as television's ultimate taboo-breaker.
Brass Eye: near the knuckle
His most recent Brass Eye, dealing with paedophilia, has been branded by The Sun newspaper as the "sickest TV ever". If Chris Morris set out to rattle a few cages, he has clearly succeeded.
But Brass Eye is only the latest in a long list of superbly-crafted, if outrageous, hoaxes perpetrated by Morris. His comedy is unsettling and often disturbing, ridiculing the medium as much as the message, more Lenny Bruce than Lenny Henry.
The son of two Cambridgeshire GPs, Chris Morris was educated at Stonyhurst College, alma mater of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the actor Charles Laughton, and read zoology at Bristol University.
Local radio beckoned, but he was soon shown the door at one station after providing his own commentaries during news bulletins. After joining the BBC's London station, GLR, he was sacked once again after broadcasting "Kiddie's Outing", in which a child would "out" a celebrity as homosexual.
Next came On The Hour on Radio 4, written with Armando Iannucci and featuring, for the first time, the voice of Radio Norwich, Alan Partridge. Paxmanesque: Chris Morris on The Day Today
The series transferred to television as The Day Today but, to Morris's credit, with completely new material. With its absurd, seemingly endless, graphic sequences and headlines like "sacked chimney-sweep pumps boss full of mayonnaise", the programme built up a cult following and Morris, who starred as a Paxmanesque anchorman, won the 1994 British Comedy Award for Best Newcomer.
The Day Today showed news television in all its absurd glory. A particularly grotesque sketch featured Patrick Marber as a condemned US prisoner who had requested to die like Elvis, electrocuted on the lavatory.
Doon Mackichan was Collaterly Sisters, a City reporter spouting financial gobbledygook, "the outlook for the markets: slightly fractious in the nines and sevens" and Alan Partridge struggled with the complexities of the Tour de France: "like cattle on bikes."
Jerry Hayes: fooled by Chris Morris
But controversy was never far away. Morris was suspended from Radio 1 after falsely announcing the death of Jimmy Savile and insinuating that Michael Heseltine had also died, provoking an instant tribute from the then Conservative MP Jerry Hayes.
For Chris Morris, 1996 was the year that changed everything. In June, he appeared on the daytime programme The Time, The Place, posing as an academic, Thurston Lowe, in a discussion entitled "Are British Men Lousy Lovers?"
He was rumbled when a producer alerted the show's host, John Stapleton.
His next venture, Brass Eye, produced by Channel Four and written with Peter Baynham, went further than any satire before it.
Using a documentary, rather than a news, format it set out to examine serious themes like crime and animal abuse, using unsuspecting celebrities as diverse as Clare Short and Bernard Manning to endorse its message and stoke up moral panic.
Alan Partridge: "Welcome to my Desk of Sport"
One episode, which dealt with a fictitious drug, Cake, prompted the Tory MP David Amess to ask questions in the House of Commons and led to Morris being sacked by Michael Grade, then chief executive at Channel Four.
Chris Morris's disquieting brilliance seems to lie in his perfectionism. Everything he does looks and sounds genuine. Film is shot just as it is for the news itself and unsuspecting guests are seduced into believing that they are appearing on a pukka show.
Morris's motives are difficult to discern. Audiences are shocked, tabloids suitably outraged, but is this comedy, performance art or purely offensive?
Chris Morris with another unsuspecting interviewee
He once explained himself thus: "If you make a joke in an area which is for some reason, normally random, out of bounds, then you might find something out, you might put your finger on something."
For many people, though, it is difficult to reconcile the idea of deconstructing humour with the realities of child abuse and drugs.
Now that the spoof interview, whether it be by Chris Morris, Mrs Merton or Ali G, is rapidly becoming old hat, it maybe time for him to move on to pastures new, to find new targets, and outlets, for his creative abilities.
Whatever happens, it is certain that Christopher Morris's considerable talent to both amuse and shock will continue to delight and disgust the nation.

Safety appeal over clock change
Clocks go back an hour in the early hours of Sunday
Fewer people would be killed or injured on UK roads if the system of changing the clocks in spring and autumn was altered, safety campaigners claim.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) wants to keep British Summer Time in winter and adopt "double summertime" between March and October. Clocks go back at 0200BST on Sunday, marking the official end of summer.
But the Shugborough estate, Staffs, will keep BST in protest at the darker evenings brought on by the time change.
Casualty rates
RoSPA say these darker evenings, combined with worsening weather conditions, cause casualty rates to increase.
They say up to 450 people a year could be saved from death or serious injury and have called for a three-year trial of their proposals.
The organisation claims the different system would mean lighter evenings all-year round and lower casualty rates.
The system means clocks would no longer revert to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in October, but stay one hour ahead until March when another hour would be added, and go back an hour the following October.
Although the mornings would be darker, the changes would give an extra hour of evening daylight throughout the year.
Leisure industries would be aided, with more people, especially women, going out on brighter evenings
Ken Livingstone, London mayor
Kevin Clinton, the head of road safety at the RoSPA, said: "Studies show that vulnerable road users such as children and the elderly are more at risk during dark evenings than in the morning."
However, it is not a view shared by Scottish National Party (SNP) education spokeswoman Fiona Hyslop, who claimed any change in policy would put more Scottish children at risk.
She tabled a motion at Holyrood on Friday backing the current Daylight Saving Time system.
Ms Hyslop said: "Several studies have shown that while there may be a decrease in the number of accidents south of the border, the reverse is the case in Scotland where additional casualties are likely to be children on their way to school."
London Mayor Ken Livingstone called for the system of putting the clocks back to be ended to help boost the tourism industry, as well as saving lives.
Public attention
He said: "The tourism season would be extended, with some estimates suggesting a boost worth up to �1bn a year. "Leisure industries would be aided, with more people, especially women, going out on brighter evenings."

In Staffordshire, visitors to the Shugborough estate - the ancestral home to the 5th Earl of Lichfield - will find it is sticking to British Summer Time (BST) instead of reverting to GMT.
It is part of a campaign with the Chamber of Commerce in Staffordshire to express the tourism industry's frustration at darker evenings brought on by the time change.
Richard Kemp, general manager of Shugborough, admits it is only a token gesture, but wanted to bring the issue to public attention.
"The evenings get so dark that people don't come any distance to visit a place that has only got so many hours of daylight," he told Radio 4's Today programme .
"We firmly believe it [a change] would make a huge difference to the way the tourist industry operates in this country."

Oprah show subtitles Susan Boyle
Susan Boyle returns home prior to her Oprah appearance
American TV bosses subtitled Britain's Got Talent star Susan Boyle when she appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show so viewers could understand her.A production crew from the daytime US talk show descended on Ms Boyle's home in Blackburn, West Lothian. They spent several hours being given a guided tour by the singing hopeful, and interviewed her neighbours. Ms Boyle later told chat show queen Oprah that the global fame she had achieved was "like a dream come true". The subtitles appeared on screen during a pre-recorded piece, but were dropped when Ms Boyle spoke live to Oprah. Ms Boyle's rendition of I Dreamed a Dream from Les Miserables on ITV1 show Britain's Got Talent turned her into a global phenomenon after being posted on YouTube. Vocal talentsThe special episode of Oprah also featured other acts from some of the 40 countries where the talent show is filmed. Speaking via a video link from her home in Scotland, 47-year-old Ms Boyle told Oprah that despite the attention, she hasn't succumbed to pressure to radically change her appearance. She said that her friend helps her with make-up, but added "that's hardly a makeover." Ms Boyle also spoke of the reason she first began to explore her vocal talents. "I was kind of slow at school, so getting something like singing was a good way of hiding behind that and so boosting my confidence," she said. Britain's Got Talent judge Simon Cowell also appeared on the Oprah show, and described his shock at hearing Ms Boyle's voice for the first time. The Oprah Winfrey Show is syndicated across the US
He said: "This lady came up, and I'm thinking 'This will take five seconds and I can go have a cup of tea'." "She knew we were going to have that reaction and just to see that look of satisfaction on her face midway through - it was one of my favourite moments." Cowell spoke about how TV talent shows have the power to transform people's lives. He said: "It gives the underdog a shot, and I think it's brilliant. The fact that we're allowing the public to make the decisions most of the time is a really good thing. "The great thing about it is when you start seeing it in places like China and Afghanistan. It's democracy. We've kinda given democracy back to the world."
