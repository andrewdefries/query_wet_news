Kazakh opposition faces tough fight
By Ian MacWilliam
BBC News, Almaty, Kazakhstan Mr Tuyakbai used to be the speaker of the Kazakh parliament The main opposition contender in Kazakhstan's upcoming presidential elections, Zharmakhan Tuyakbai, says that high-level corruption is one of the main problems facing his country. He told the BBC that contracts giving control of major national enterprises to people close to the president should be re-examined. If these contracts are found to have involved corrupt practices, he said, the enterprises should be re-privatised according to the law. Mr Tuyakbai is one of 11 candidates for Kazakhstan's presidential elections, scheduled for 4 December. He represents a movement named For a Just Kazakhstan, an alliance of the country's main opposition parties. It is unclear just how much popular backing the alliance has, but the country's weak opposition groups have always struggled for support among a post-Soviet population which is still largely apolitical. Anti-corruption
Mr Tuyakbai will be running against the current president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has led Kazakhstan since before its independence from the collapsing Soviet Union. Most of the other candidates are relatively unknown figures. Mr Tuyakbai's call for a re-examination of privatisation deals echoes moves by opposition groups who have come to power in Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, following the overthrow of incumbent presidents in those two post-Soviet republics. "The money from the sale of natural resources today, or stolen by officials close to the president's family - that money doesn't go into the national budget," said Mr Tuyakbai.
Kazakhstan is rich in oil, but only an elite few are said to benefit
"What's more, contracts for resource industries were often the result of corrupt deals, and these deals have damaged our national interests." "Those contracts should be re-examined to determine how legal they were," he added. Accusations of corrupt business dealings by members of President Nazarbayev's family and inner circle are among the most politically damaging charges against the head of state. Kazakhstan is rich in oil, minerals, land and other natural resources. But analysts say that many of the most profitable enterprises have fallen into the hands of a small number of people in the ruling elite. Mr Tuyakbai also contends that Kazakhstan's political system must be changed to reduce what he says is an excessive concentration of power in the hands of the president. "We need a change of political system," he said, "a change from an all-powerful president to a parliamentary-presidential system, where parliament will have the role it deserves, and where parliament will form the government and control the government's activity by overseeing the law and the budget." Looking west
The presidents of all the post-Soviet republics of Central Asia increased their own powers considerably through the 1990s, reducing their parliaments to little more than rubber stamps. We should look to greater integration with Europe. That's the most appropriate for Kazakhstan
Zharmakhan Tuyakbai
In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan, opposition leaders who came to power there in March have also said they want to give greater powers to the Kyrgyz parliament. The new Kyrgyz government however, has yet to put forward a definite plan for constitutional change. As Moscow, Washington and increasingly Beijing vie for influence in Central Asia, another lively political debate is which way Kazakhstan should look for its future development.
Historically Russia has been the dominant power in the region, but the opposition candidate says Moscow cannot provide a stable lead when its own political direction is now so unclear. China and the Muslim countries of the Middle East are culturally too different from Kazakhstan, so Mr Tuyakbai thinks his country should look to the West. And since the United States has its own geopolitical interests, Europe provides the best example for a way forward. "Europe has never declared its interests and tried to exert pressure or influence in this region," he said.
"But it brings to this country the ideas and principles that we're seeking - equality, freedom, democracy and the example of the dignity of its own people. "We should look to greater integration with Europe. That's the most appropriate for Kazakhstan." Formidable opponent
During the election campaign, which officially gets underway on Tuesday, Mr Tuyakbai will have a difficult battle on his hands.
Among the president's challengers, Mr Tuyakbai certainly has the strongest credentials. Until last year he was speaker of the Kazakh parliament and deputy chairman of the president's own party, Otan (Fatherland). But following parliamentary elections a year ago, Mr Tuyakbai surprised the country by publishing an open letter in an opposition newspaper in which he said they had been rigged.
President Nazarbayev has been in power for 14 years
In the letter he alleged that media bias and pressure from local government officials had unfairly ensured Otan's sweeping victory, and he challenged President Nazarbayev to overturn the official results. Mr Tuyakbai resigned from as speaker and also quit Otan, before resurfacing as a contender for the president's job himself. He says the campaign system is skewed against the opposition since most local election committees back the president. But apart from that, Mr Tuyakbai's real challenge is that he is standing against a president who, after 14 years in power, is still broadly popular. Mr Nazarbayev has a solid record of leading Kazakhstan from a very uncertain independence to a position where its economy is growing strongly and where life, for most people, is getting better. He will not be easily beaten. E-mail this to a friend

France warning of war with Iran
Mr Kouchner has sounded the alarm over Iran's nuclear programme
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner says the world should prepare for war over Iran's nuclear programme.
"We have to prepare for the worst, and the worst is war," Mr Kouchner said in an interview on French TV and radio.
He was speaking ahead of a visit to Russia on Monday, during which Iran is likely to feature prominently.
Iran's nuclear programme will also be one of the main issues for the UN nuclear watchdog's annual conference, starting in Vienna on Monday.
Iran denies it is trying to acquire nuclear weapons, and says it only wants nuclear power to generate electricity for civilian purposes.
But it has repeatedly rejected UN demands to give up the enrichment of uranium, which the US and other Western states fear is being diverted to a nuclear weapons project.
Tougher approach
Mr Kouchner said negotiations with Iran should continue "right to the end", but that an Iranian nuclear weapon would pose "a real danger for the whole world".
He said a number of large French companies had been asked not to tender for business in Iran. The shift in Paris is part of a broader change of diplomatic gear under a young and dynamic president
Jonathan MarcusBBC diplomatic correspondent
New France gets tough
Profile: Bernard Kouchner
"We are not banning French companies from submitting. We have advised them not to. These are private companies." "But I think that it has been heard and we are not the only ones to have done this."
Mr Kouchner will seek agreement with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov over tighter UN sanctions to try to force Iran to give up enrichment, the French foreign ministry says.
Russia has a UN Security Council veto over any new sanctions, and its support is seen as vital for any new approach. It also has perhaps the greatest leverage over Tehran, as the supplier of fuel for its nuclear reactor.
But Mr Kouchner said even in the absence of UN action, the European Union should prepare its own sanctions against Iran.
"We have decided while negotiations are continuing, to prepare eventual sanctions outside the ambit of UN sanctions. Our good friends, the Germans, suggested that," he said.
'Playing for time'
Iran has warned that any new punishments could push it to stop co-operating with the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The IAEA's members meet this week in Austria, with Iran likely to top the agenda.
The director of the organisation, Mohamed ElBaradei, has been criticised in the West over a new deal with Iran to clear up questions about its past nuclear activities. Iran says its nuclear programme is peaceful
The US and its allies believe the deal just gives Iran more time, during which they fear it will advance its nuclear programme.
Since becoming foreign minister earlier this year, Mr Kouchner has not shied away from controversy.
Last month he was quoted as saying the Iraqi government was "not functioning" and seemed to hint that Prime Minister Nouri Maliki should resign, provoking an angry reaction from Baghdad.
The BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says France has changed its approach to world affairs under its new President Nicolas Sarkozy, adopting a harder line on several issues, and seeking to improve relations with the United States.
But it is the tougher rhetoric aimed at Tehran which will please Washington the most, he says.
Until now the UN Security Council has imposed economic sanctions on Iran, but did not allow for military action. The United States has not ruled out a military attack against Iran to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon. E-mail this to a friend

Campaign for soldiers shot at dawn
By Tom Warren
BBC News
Executed WWI British soldiers were pardoned in 2006
On Saturday, more than 90 years after being shot for desertion, Pte James Smith's name will finally be added to Bolton's roll of honour to soldiers killed in World War I.It is one of many events taking place across the UK to mark the first Armed Forces Day, which has replaced Veterans' Day. The long-awaited recognition for Pte Smith, known as Jimmy, comes after a campaign by his great, great nephew Charles Sandbach. In 2006 the government formally pardoned 306 British soldiers executed for military offences other than murder or mutiny. He [Pte Smith] never showed any fear but his mental state meant he would not take orders to go into suicidal operations
Charles Sandbach
But more than 90 years after their deaths the sense of anger and injustice felt by some of their descendants still burns strongly. Pte Smith joined the Army in 1910 and served with the 1st Battalion of Lancashire Fusiliers. At the outbreak of war he was posted to Africa and served at Gallipoli before being transferred to the Western Front, where he fought bravely in the Somme and was promoted to L/Cpl. During a battle he was buried alive after an explosion of German artillery and had to be dug out. He was never the same again and suffered what today would be recognised as post traumatic stress disorder, Mr Sandbach said. "He was a sick man. But he was transferred back to the Ypres sector and his mental deterioration started to manifest itself," he said. Pte Harry Farr was 25 when he was shot
"He never showed any fear but his mental state meant he would not take orders to go into suicidal operations." Pte Smith, aged 26, was tried, found guilty of wilful disobedience and sentenced to death. Most of the firing squad, who initially refused to carry out the order, deliberately missed the target, leaving the soldier injured but still alive, Mr Sandbach said. Jimmy Smith's friend, Pte Richard Blundell, was then ordered to kill him after the commanding officer, a Lt Collins, could not bring himself to fire the fatal shot. "The circumstances were appalling, but he [Pte Blundell] had to do what he had to do," Mr Sandbach said. "In my opinion he [Pte Smith] was murdered by the British Army and I can't believe they did what they did. "Richard lived until he was 95 and on his death bed in 1989 he was calling out Jimmy's name. "Jimmy was the only soldier from Bolton executed. For 92 years he was forgotten about, now on Saturday he is being respected, justice has been done." 'Peace of mind'Pte Blundell's daughter Jean Corwen, 84, from Preston, will also attend the ceremony in Bolton. "I hope it gives her some peace of mind," Mr Sandbach added. The best-known of the executed WWI soldiers was Pte Harry Farr, who was shot at dawn in 1916 after refusing to return to the front line. His family had always argued the soldier, of the 1st Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment, was suffering from shell shock at the time. Their court battle with the government to officially clear his name led to all 306 soldiers being granted formal pardons. Another of these was Pte Bernard McGeehan, from Derry, Northern Ireland, who was executed on 2 November 1916 after being found guilty of desertion. The first time I stood at his [Pte McGeehan's] grave I broke down in tears
John McGeehan
His second cousin John McGeehan, from Pontypool, south Wales, visits his grave each year at Poperingue Cemetery near Ypres. He discovered his distant relative's story while researching family history. "The first time I stood at his grave I broke down in tears because I suddenly realised I was the first McGeehan who had stood at that grave for 80 years," he said. Pte McGeehan, of the Liverpool King's Regiment, worked at a horse marshalling yard in Ardrigues after signing up to the Army in 1913, but was sent to the front line after the Somme. "He was not a bright person and would probably be known today as [someone with] special needs," Mr McGeehan said. 'Taint of cowardice'"[The front line] was alien to him and after a period of time he cracked." The soldier disappeared from duty for five days and returned without his weapon, Mr McGeehan said. "It was totally unjust. Bernard's court martial was written on two pages of handwritten notes. It's just immoral." Mr McGeehan is now campaigning to have his relative's name added to Derry's war memorial. Military historian Julian Putkowski, who co-authored Shot at Dawn, said many communities have already added the names of the executed soldiers to their memorials. He said their family members still had raw feelings about the actions of the British Army. "The taint of cowardice runs down the blood line," he said. "Always [the family] take it personally."

Civil service sick leave 'concern'
Three nurses appointed to help
A Stormont minister has said that levels of sick leave within the Northern Ireland civil service are a cause for major concern. On average, staff in the various departments are absent through sickness for 15.1 days a year, according to a new survey. The report Sickness Absence in the Northern Ireland Departments 2001/2002 is part of efforts to reduce civil service sick leave levels. Poor attendance can lead to reduced productivity and efficiency Ian PearsonNIO minister
Just 14.6% of staff were responsible for the vast majority of working days. Nearly a quarter of working days were lost through psychiatric or psychological illnesses. More than 35% of staff had no sick leave during the financial year 2001/2002. Finance and Personnel minister Ian Pearson said the current level was a cause for major concern.
The minister said poor attendance could lead to reduced productivity and efficiency which created "obvious additional pressures" for remaining staff. He added: "It is vital that measures are in place to support staff members through illness and to assist their recovery and return to normal working."
As part of measures to deal with the problem, a psychiatric nurse and two occupational health nurses have been appointed. SDLP MLA for East Londonderry John Dallat said the levels of psychiatric and psychological illness meant the conditions and circumstances in which civil servants worked needed to be comprehensively reviewed. "The whole hierarchy of the civil service needs a complete revision so that people at every level feel they are making an important contribution to the service they are employed in," he said.

Hitchens: Clinton could sell out Blair
Tony Blair and Bill Clinton deny any split over Kosovo
Political commentator Christopher Hitchens tells BBC News Online's Edward Main why he believes that US President Bill Clinton may betray UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Nato over Kosovo.
"War criminal, criminal psychopath and rapist" are descriptions of Bill Clinton that you won't find in the Starr report. They are all charges made by Christopher Hitchens whose new book on the US president, No One Left To Lie To, is riding high in the American bestseller lists. After years of Clinton-watching, The British-born journalist is convinced that the most powerful man in the world is incapable of grasping the concept of morality as anything more than an easily-dispensable slogan.
The Vanity Fair columnist believes that despite his rhetoric the president has no interest in the latest Balkans crisis and desires a quick exit above all else.
Clinton's 'invertebrate style'
Christopher Hitchens: Gave evidence to the Clinton impeachment inquiryMr Clinton, Hitchens argues, has from the start shown signs of being willing, if necessary, to "sell out" his allies and their joint promises to see the Kosovo Albanian refugees safely home.
"Clinton has had the orphaned Kosovo issue forced on him for adoption. But his heart, his gut, and his nerve are not involved in at all. He wishes it could have been avoided," Hitchens says.
"He is signalling every kind of weakness and invertebrate style while Tony Blair has been out there every day saying 'This is a matter of principle and we must stand firm.'
Christopher Hitchens: I wince for Mr Blair when he compares himself to Mr Clinton"I mean to say, as directly as I possibly can, that with Clinton the concept of matter of principle does not exist. He would not in his own mind be able in his own mind to formulate such a thing, in my view.
"It's a foreign idea to him. If he is in shot when he hears an expression like matter of principle or character or integrity he wonders what face to put on now and will it be convincing." Transatlantic 'split' over partition
Hitchens says Mr Clinton has made noises that he would accept an ethnic partition of Kosovo rather than send in ground troops if negotiations fail to produce a settlement based on Nato's aims. Dividing up Kosovo would mean many refugees could never return to their homesBut it is a compromise which the UK insists is totally unacceptable.
Other Nato members would also be likely find it repugnant to allow the Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to keep some of the spoils of his latest ethnic cleansing campaign.
Mr Blair would also be unwilling for Kosovo to be split into two areas overseen separately by Nato and Russian forces - who might be more sympathetic to Belgrade's point of view.
"Nothing is acceptable if it is de facto partition," he said at the EU summit in Cologne.
Mr Clinton and Mr Blair have gone to pains to deny reports that they are divided over Kosovo.
But Hitchens believes the UK Government must be harbouring concerns about its ally's intentions.
"Robin Cook and Blair must have been thinking, 'Now wait a minute these are our reputations he is playing with as well as his own.' I don't think that can be overstated.
"If Blair isn't worried then he is as immune to scepticism as Mr Clinton is to self-criticism."
'Pseudo-statesmanship'
A settlement achieved through the division of Kosovo would have several merits for the president, Hitchens believes.
"I think Clinton makes a shrewd calculation that anything that could be presented as peace with honour or a victory would be embraced by the American electorate in its aggregate form," he says. Christopher Hitchens: Milosevic should have been taken out years ago"There would be many people who might denounce it as a sell-out or a betrayal.
"But anything that could be argued was a solution that could also be attributed to the bombing campaign I think he would accept.
"It would also be an opportunity for him to repair the extremely damaged relations that have arisen between the US and China and the former Soviet Union.
"So in that sense for him it would be another temptation for pseudo-statesmanship."
No friend of Bill
Anyone who dismisses this analysis as the product terminal cynicism would be wise to read No One Left to Lie To, Hitchens insists.
This punchy polemic is unlikely to find shelf space in the memorial library which in presidential tradition will be built to honour Mr Clinton when he leaves office. Rushed to press in the wake of the impeachment trial it argues that Mr Clinton's deceit over his affair with Monica Lewinsky is among his lesser sins. It accuses Mr Clinton of being ever ready to make or break almost any promise to gain or maintain power. Juanita Broaddrick: Mr Clinton has denied her claims that he raped her in 1978Hitchens argues that in his "reign of mendacity" Mr Clinton has habitually betrayed his liberal supporters, pursuing a right-wing policy agenda aimed at sleazy campaign fund donors. He also backs hotly-denied allegations that Mr Clinton has sexually assaulted a series of women. Most gravely of all the book alleges that, more than once, Mr Clinton has ordered or allowed the deaths of innocent people to create a distraction to get himself out of a tight corner.
The weapons factory that never was
As an example, Hitchens cites the US missile strike against the El Shifa chemical factory in Sudan in August 1998.
He also believes it was an incident that was a valuable lesson for Mr Blair about the "masochism of the special relationship".
The bombing coincided with Monica Lewinsky's second grand jury appearanceThe attack, supported by Mr Blair, was claimed as a reprisal for the bombings of two US embassies in Africa.
Hitchens says that its real purpose was to provide an instant boost to the president's image on the day that Ms Lewinsky made her second grand jury appearance.
The evidence produced to back White House claims that the plant was linked to the bombings suspect, Islamic dissident Osama bin Laden, and that it produced chemical weapons not medicines has all been discredited, he says.
So much so that the US has unfrozen the assets of the factory's owner who is suing for compensation in the American courts.
Hitchens says that the four services heads of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were reportedly kept in the dark about the attack. The CIA has also let it be known that it opposed the air strike, he adds.
Christopher Hitchens: Mr Clinton told five layers of lies to cover up his war crimesThe rockets were launched without warning against a country with which the US had diplomatic relations and which had previously expelled Mr bin Laden at Washington's request.
The FBI was also reportedly furious that Mr Clinton ordered the missiles in before it could warn its agents in Africa.
"Take away all the exploded claims about Sudan and the question 'What was the hurry?' practically answers itself," says Hitchens.
Deadly legacy
Hitchens says that the deadly consequences of what he sees as a presidential PR stunt will be suffered for a long while yet.
Hitchens says the bombing destroyed Sudan's ability to fight a meningitis outbreakThe bombing flattened a factory which he says produced 60% of the medical supplies for a country ravaged by civil war and famine.
This means Sudan has been unable to effectively combat what he Red Cross has described as a "furious meningitis epidemic" which has claimed the lives of at least 2,000 children and young people, he says. "So not only were there people killed needlessly in the bombing itself but people also have been and are dying down the road and all of them to save President Clinton's face," he says.
"Look at that face and ask how many people would you allow to die to save it and you are asking the right question. And you would be asking a question that the Foreign Office and the prime minister did not ask, but one that required an answer."

Do you think Gibraltar should stay British?
Updated 18 April 2002, 19.13
Last month 25,000 out of the 30,000 people that live in Gibraltar came out on to the streets to protest against losing British sovereignty.
They are worried that Britain will agree to share Gibraltar with Spain and they won't get a say on the matter.
So, we want to know what you think. Do you think Gibraltar should stay British?
Unfortunately this topic is now closed but there are Comments pages on other subjects on the main Chat index.
I used to live in Gibraltar and my dad still lives there. He feels strongly that it should stay British as do I. It's not Britain's choice or Spain's, Gibraltar should vote - that's the only way this can be resolved and it's clear what they think.Nicki, 15, Welshpool
It is about time Gibraltar got some coverage on the news, after all it is a British colony. There should be referendum on the issue in Gibraltar it is the people's choice.Tim, 15, Cheshire
If most people want to stay British they should.Clare, 12, Essex
Well, I went to Gibraltar last half-term. It's amazing to see a piece of Britain in the sun. I spoke to some of the people there and they all agree they like it as it is. I think what remains of the British Empire should remain, especially since the people that live want to remain British as well.Adam, Ashington
If the people of Gibraltar want to stay British, why not let them? If 83% of them actually physically go out and rally to stop us from sharing them with Spain, we should NOT! Have they been offered their independence? They may like this option. It all comes down to what the citizenship think, and therefore we should keep Gibraltar as it is. Greg, Swansea
I agree, it should be up to the people of Gibraltar.Douglas, 14, Glasgow
It's a worry for a country to be forced into doing something they don't want to do. People have rights and we should respect them. These people have British passports, can we really take them away?Nicky, 14, Newcastle
I used to live in Gibraltar for three years and I think that it should stay British because it has been British for so long - the majority of Gibraltar want that.Rachel, 10, Plymouth
It is up to the people of Gibraltar and they have shown great support on keeping British sovereignty. The people of Gibraltar have adapted to the British way of life so let it be that way for as long as they want to.Alexander, 12, Aberdeen I think that Gibraltar should stay English because the children and adults will have to learn Spanish and it would be unfair for the people. Half of my family live in Gibraltar and they don't want to move so I think that the government should let the people vote and leave Spain out of it until the votes are counted.Francesca, 12, Welwyn Garden City Why should Spain own Gibraltar? It's part of our country. It's just like giving the Midlands to Spain!Nina, 13, Peterborough
I think the people of Gibraltar should get the final say.Sam, 13, Bristol

Chad: sigue �xodo hacia Camer�n
Redacci�n BBC Mundo
La llegada de miles de refugiados que escapan del conflicto en Chad est� poniendo en aprietos a las organizaciones humanitarias en el vecino Camer�n.
El flujo de refugiados no se detiene.
Desde que el s�bado los rebeldes intentaron tomar la capital de Chad, Yamena, cerca de 20.000 personas cruzaron el r�o Chari para refugiarse en la localidad camerunesa de Kousseri.
Sin embargo, la oficina del Alto Comisionado de la ONU para los Refugiados (ACNUR) se�al� que se necesitan con urgencia suministros y mejores condiciones para alojarlos.
Los rebeldes se retiraron de Yamena y el gobierno franc�s amenaz� con enfrentarlos si lanzan otro ataque a la ciudad.
La antigua potencia colonial envi� 14.000 soldados al pa�s africano y ayud� a evacuar a los extranjeros que quer�an abandonar la capital.
Uno de los refugiados que consigui� escapar al sur de Nigeria cont� su drama personal a la BBC.
"No se que hacer. Llam� por tel�fono a mi amigo en Yamena y me dijo que a mi madre, mi padre y mi prometida les dispararon. No se si llorar o suicidarme".
Amenaza francesa
Mientras tanto, el gobierno franc�s se�al� su disposici�n a intervenir en el conflicto, tras la aprobaci�n de una resoluci�n del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU que "conden� en�rgicamente" la ofensiva rebelde.
Por el momento, el gobierno parece tener bajo control la capital.
El canciller franc�s, Bernard Kouchner, dijo que "esperaba" que las tropas de su pa�s no tuvieran que intervenir.
Sin embargo, el presidente Nicolas Sarkozy recalc� que, de ser necesario, Francia "asumir� su deber".
Mientras tanto, el m�ximo dirigente del principal grupo rebelde, Mahamat Nouri, le dijo a la BBC que estaba dispuesto a anunciar un cese el fuego, si a cambio le promet�an negociaciones con el gobierno.
Sin embargo, el embajador de Chad en Estados Unidos, Mahamoud Bechir, indic� que un anuncio de cese el fuego no era necesario porque las tropas del gobierno ya hab�an hecho retroceder a los rebeldes.
Una misi�n mediadora encabezada por Libia viajar� a Yamena para intentar poner fin a las hostilidades.
La Uni�n Europea se�al� que los combates en Chad no impedir�n el despliegue de una fuerza de mantenimiento de paz en la parte oriental del pa�s para proteger a los cerca de 400.000 desplazados del conflicto en Darfur.

Lions lacking a leader
James Copnall
BBC Sport in Dakar
Have Your Say on the weekend's Nations Cup qualifiers
Fadiga will be sorely missed
Senegal flew off to Gambia on Friday evening in a confident mood after four days of training at the national stadium despite big selection problems. New coach Guy Stephan had a cheery air as he contemplated his first competitive match in charge of the Lions.
"It will be a great honour to coach Senegal on Sunday against Gambia," he said.
"But the most important thing is that the team gets a good result.
I would love to captain my country, but I think it is unlikely
El Hadji Diouf
"We have trained well this week, and unlike before my first game in charge I have had a lot of time to assess my players."
Stephan's first match, a friendly loss to Morocco last month, is perceived by many Senegalese players as a welcome wake-up call.
"Losing to Morocco was probably a good thing," midfielder Salif Diao admitted.
"It showed us we could be beaten, and made us come down off our cloud.
"Now we will be fully concentrated for the Gambia game."
Diao himself may however miss the match.
The Liverpool star has a leg injury and sat out training on Friday.
Added to the absences through injury and suspension of Aliou Cisse, Omar Daf, Moussa Ndiaye, Lamine Diatta and Khalilou Fadiga, it means the Lions will field an unfamiliar line-up.
And with both Cisse and his stand-in Fadiga missing, who will captain the African team of the moment remains a mystery.
Diao would have been a strong candidate, before his injury.
A less likely option is El Hadji Diouf.
"I have never been asked to do it before," Diouf confided.
"I would love to captain my country if I get the chance - but I think it is unlikely to happen!"

McManus named new Celtic captain
Stephen McManus has committed his future to Celtic
Scotland defender Stephen McManus has signed a new, four-year contract with Celtic and won the race to be their new club captain.
The 24-year-old had shared the captaincy with veteran defender Steven Pressley during pre-season.
McManus succeeds Neil Lennon, who joined Nottingham Forest in the summer, and said: "To be given the captaincy of Celtic is a tremendous honour.
"It is undoubtedly one of the highlights of my career so far."
Media Conference: Celtic captain Stephen McManus
McManus has been a regular starter under manager Gordon Strachan, helping him to two Scottish championship flags in successive seasons.
MY SPORT: DEBATE
Are you happy with Gordon Strachan's choice of captain?
"I'm proud to follow in the footsteps of so many great Celtic captains from the past and I hope that I will be able to achieve as much success as they have over the years," he said.
McManus' decision to commit himself to Celtic long-term may have swung the captaincy his way.
"I've come through the ranks here at the club and am proud to have played a part in the success we've had these past few seasons," he said about his contract extension.
"Hopefully that will continue in the years to come, both in Scotland and in European competition as well."
