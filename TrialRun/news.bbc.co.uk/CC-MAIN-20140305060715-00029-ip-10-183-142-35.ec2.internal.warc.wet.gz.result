US and Japan to renew alliance Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. President Obama: "Our alliance is founded on shared values and shared interests"
US President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama have agreed on the need to renew their two countries' strained alliance.Mr Obama told reporters after talks in Tokyo that their bond was based on shared values and interests but should be renewed for the 21st Century. Mr Hatoyama said that, after 50 years, the alliance had to adapt to change. Mr Obama's first Asian tour as US leader is aimed at reassuring key allies and boosting economic growth. He has called for a growth strategy "that is both balanced and broadly shared". His eight-day tour will take him to Singapore, China and South Korea and includes an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit. He told Reuters news agency earlier that China was a "partner" as well as rival but warned of "enormous strains" in relations between the world's two most powerful nations if economic imbalances between them were not corrected. China will soon overtake Japan as the world's second largest economy, the BBC's Alastair Leithead reports from Tokyo. The trip is the president's Asian charm offensive as the glitz starts to fade from the year's fashion for Obama-mania, our correspondent says. The new world order is emerging fast in Asia as the region outgrows decades of American supremacy and the visit is the beginning of a battle to keep the US relevant in the turbulent years of change that lie ahead, he adds. Friction with TokyoMr Hatoyama confirmed Japan would no longer refuel ships that supply forces in Afghanistan but promised an "alternative package", which would involve civilian aid in areas such as schooling, agriculture and police.

"I think we have to consider the meaning of this logistical support, and we've come to think there's another type of assistance that is more appropriate for Afghanistan," he said. He also promised to work with the US to combat climate change and nuclear proliferation. On the dispute with the US over plans to keep a US air base on the island of Okinawa, albeit in a different location, he said only that the base was a "difficult issue". Washington thought the issue was settled three years ago but Mr Hatoyama, who came to power this year, has said he wants to review the agreement reached. Mr Obama said the US and Japan would work quickly to resolve the dispute. Japanese peace activists have criticised Mr Obama for not taking time to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Mr Obama said he would visit the sites of the atomic bomb attacks on another occasion. Japan has deployed about 16,000 police officers to provide security in Tokyo during the visit, which is expected to see further demonstrations. Afghan pledgeChina's growing economic and military power and its effect on relations with Washington are also concerns for some Japanese. OBAMA IN ASIA
Friday 13 November: Arrives in Japan
Saturday 14: Leaves Tokyo for Apec summit in Singapore
Sunday 15: Has talks with Russia's President Medvedev among others at the summit before leaving for China
Tuesday 17: Summit in Beijing with Chinese President Hu Jintao
Wednesday 18: Ends tour with visit to South Korea
Three days of the tour are being devoted to the Chinese leg during which Mr Obama hopes to discuss a revaluation of the Chinese currency. He is also set to discuss opening Chinese markets further to US goods and encouraging Chinese consumers to spend more. China signalled on Wednesday that it might allow an appreciation of the yuan. Mr Obama spent several years in Indonesia as a child and is seen as the first president with an "Asia-Pacific orientation", the BBC's Kim Ghattas reports from Washington. He will try to capitalise on this as he seeks to build on and improve crucial relationships with allies and rivals across the Pacific, our correspondent adds. Mr Obama stopped off in Alaska on his way, touching down at Elmendorf Air Force Base where he spoke to a military audience about his strategy in Afghanistan. "I will not risk your lives unless it is necessary to America's vital interests," he told troops. The US administration has been locked in an intense debate over a request from the American commander in Afghanistan for thousands of extra troops amid doubts over the competence and integrity of the Afghan government. No decision on the surge request is expected during Mr Obama's visit to Asia, said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs. Are you in Asia?

BBC local video scheme rejected
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. BBC Trust Chairman Michael Lyons: 'Negative impact would be significant'
The BBC Trust has rejected controversial plans to launch a �68m network of local news websites with video content.
The plan has faced fierce opposition from newspaper publishers, who have argued that it could damage or kill off their own local online operations.
The trust said the BBC's proposal did not meet its criteria for offering value to the public.
Instead the corporation should focus on improving existing regional services.
A study by broadcasting watchdog Ofcom found that if BBC local video services were launched, annual revenues at existing commercial providers would fall by up to 4%.
We believe the BBC's priority should be improving the quality of existing services
Sir Michael LyonsBBC Trust chairman
The provision of local video services could also deter local commercial media from further innovation in online local news, sports, and weather services, Ofcom added.
Earlier this month, bosses of local newspaper companies told MPs on the Commons culture select committee that local papers - which are already struggling in the difficult economic climate - would be further damaged by an "out-of-control" BBC .
Quality programmes
Sir Michael Lyons, chairman of the BBC Trust, said that while licence fee payers wanted better regional and local services from the BBC, the proposal to run 65 video websites was "unlikely to achieve what they want".
"We also recognise the negative impact that the local video proposition could have on commercial media services which are valued by the public and are already under pressure," Sir Michael added.
People don't think we serve local audiences well enough and they want us to do more
Caroline ThomsonBBC chief operating officer
"Our decision to refuse permission for local video means that local newspapers and other commercial media can invest in their online services in the knowledge that the BBC does not intend to make this new intervention in the market."
He called on BBC management to consider carefully the conclusions of the trust's public value test before putting forward new proposals.
"We believe the BBC's priority should be improving the quality of existing services. The public wants better quality regional television news programmes and more programmes of all kinds produced in and reflecting their areas," Sir Michael said.
No improved reach
The BBC's proposal had envisaged websites with on-demand videos, featuring news and sport as well as weather and user-generated content.
Ofcom said the BBC plan may stifle innovation by other news organisations
Users would access the free content, which would not have carried adverts, using either a computer with a broadband internet connection or a 3G mobile phone.
But the trust said the proposal would not have improved the BBC's reach to audiences it was not serving very well, such as poorer people and those living in remote areas without access to broadband.
The BBC's chief operating officer, Caroline Thomson defended the proposal, describing it as "our suggestion about what more we could do".
"What the trust has been saying to us is that we have gaps: people don't think we serve local audiences well enough and they want us to do more," she said.
Local papers are closing and job cuts mean thousands of journalists don't have the time to do their jobs properly anymore
Jeremy DearNUJ general secretary
Investment call
The industry body for Commercial Radio, RadioCentre, said that the trust had reached "a sensible conclusion".
"Local communities already receive valuable local news and information from 320 commercial radio stations spread across the UK," chief executive Andrew Harrison said.
"The introduction of a publicly funded service of this nature would have had a devastating effect on these small local businesses."
But the National Union of Journalists said that the rejection was "a missed opportunity to enhance local media".
"Local papers are closing and job cuts mean thousands of journalists don't have the time to do their jobs properly anymore," said the NUJ's general secretary Jeremy Dear.

Examples of BBC local TV service
He added that while ITV was scaling back regional and local news, the BBC proposal was "an opportunity to take a small step in the opposite direction by actually enhancing local news provision" and called on the BBC to ensure other local news services benefited from investment.
The NUJ also accused local media bosses of cutting jobs to boost profits and of opposing the BBC plan to protect their investment.
"Now is the time for them to put their money where their mouth is and invest more in local journalism - in jobs, in training and in resources for hard-pressed newsrooms."

Bank reform 'needs to be radical'
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Paul Myners calls for Sir Fred Goodwin to do charity work
A review of how banks are governed should be "more radical", Treasury minister Lord Myners has told the BBC.He told business editor Robert Peston the names and salaries of top earners below board level should be disclosed. Banks should give more voting rights to loyal shareholders who stay on as engaged owners rather than sell up, Lord Myners also suggested. The government-commissioned review is being carried out by former regulator Sir David Walker. Lord Myners told the BBC that the Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS) former chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin informed him last year that almost 200 of his bank's employees earned more than he did. Sir Fred originally left his post with a £16.6m pension pot, although he agreed in June to hand back £4.7m. Lord Myners also discussed in the interview his involvement in the rescue of RBS and the high-profile pension row. Highly criticalHe said of Sir Fred: "I did, when I spoke to Fred Goodwin during the months between October and February last year, urge on him that there was much he could do in the area of public service and public duty, which would help assuage people's anger at the outcome." He added that he envisaged Sir Fred doing something "in the charitable area", and that it was not too late for him to "do something". Lord Myners is a classic poacher turned gamekeeper, says our business editor, having made a fortune building up and running a fund management company, Gartmore, a big institutional investor in British companies.
A share certificate is a right and entitlement of ownership which carries with it certain responsibilities
Lord Myners
But now as the Treasury's City minister, he is on a mission to make such shareholders take a more responsible attitude to their ownership of businesses. In his interview for the BBC's Leading Questions, Lord Myners was highly critical of shareholders who prefer to sell shares in companies that take a wrong turn, rather than staying on as owners and pressurising boards to fix what's wrong. In urging Sir David to be more radical than he has been up to now, Paul Myners wants him to force banks to disclose the names and pay packages of their top earners, irrespective of whether or not those receiving large bonuses are on the board. Our correspondent said that in calling for this action - among others - Lord Myners will be seen as humiliating those with whom he worked cheek-by-jowl for more than 30 years. Market confidenceLord Myners told the BBC that shareholders who do not hold shares for the long term should have inferior rights as owners, arguing that "companies are too important" for big shareholders to trade in and out of them "willy nilly". "We've lost sight of the fact that a share certificate - in fact we don't have them now, it's all recorded electronically - but a share certificate is a right and entitlement of ownership which carries with it certain responsibilities," Lord Myners added. "It's not a piece of paper to be traded, to be bought and sold." Peter Montagnon, of the Association of British Insurers, said Lord Myners was "absolutely right" to raise a "real point" about the danger of "ownerless companies being unaccountable". He said more needed to be done to "build up the critical mass of good, long-term owners" who were becoming a "diminishing band". Reaching out to sovereign wealth funds, which own around 10% of UK companies, might be one way of doing this, he said. But he said owners had to be able to retain the right to sell and differential voting rights was not the answer. "If you discriminate between types of shareholder, that's not good for confidence in market." Leading Questions is broadcast at 2230 BST on the BBC News channel.

Mental health reform 'unproven'
The plans have proved controversial
A major review has concluded there is little evidence to suggest a key plank of government plans to toughen up mental health laws actually works.
The Mental Health Bill would allow for compulsory treatment of people with a range of psychiatric disorders in the community. But the Institute of Psychiatry review found no evidence from other countries of community treatments orders' worth.
The government rejected accusations the review had been buried.
Community treatment orders won't help people at all
Paul FarmerMind
Doctors have used a "treatability test" since the mid 20th century to decide if someone should be detained.
It has been the practice that people with personality disorders have not been detained because their condition cannot be treated. But the government now says they can be detained and given some kind of therapy.
Tim Loughton, the shadow health minister, said ministers had had access to the conclusions of the review for six months, but had chosen not to release them while the Bill was being debated by the House of Lords.
He said: "The government are guilty of disgraceful manipulation in regard to the timing of the publication of this report."
No robust evidence
The Department of Health dismissed this as "absolute nonsense".
A spokesperson said a final, peer-reviewed copy of the report had only been received less than three weeks before it was made public.
The plans have proved controversial, and the Lords last month voted for a series of amendments placing restrictions on the use of CTOs.
The report, which examined 72 studies into the use of CTOs in six countries, found it was not possible to state they were beneficial or harmful to patients.
It concluded: "Overall, although some stakeholder views are positive, there is currently no robust evidence about either the positive or negative effects of CTOs on key outcomes, including hospital readmission, length of hospital stay, improved medication compliance, or patients' quality of life."
Further research
The Department of Health said there had been positive reports about the effect of CTOs from New Zealand, Australia, US and Scotland.
A spokesperson said: "Community treatment orders (CTOs) are a key part of helping to solve the problem of 'revolving door' patients.
"We know that many tragedies in mental health are preceded by non-compliance with treatment and CTOs will address this."
However, Professor Louis Appleby, the government's National Director of Mental Health, announced on Wednesday that Oxford University would carry out further research into how CTOs will work in practice.
Paul Farmer, chief executive of mental health charity Mind, said the government plans were "fundamentally flawed".
He said: "Community treatment orders won't help people at all. "They do not improve compliance with medication. They do not lower incidents of violence or arrest. They do not reduce length of stays in hospital. They do not prevent re-admissions. "But they will scare vulnerable people away from seeking help when they need it." Rowena Daw, of the Mental Health Alliance, said: "We call on the government to use the evidence its own research has provided and to listen to the professionals, patients and families who have expressed such strong concerns about CTOs.
"We agree with government that compulsory treatment in the community can help a small number of people in very specific situations, but the current plans go too far. "They will not limit the use of CTOs to this small group of people and they will place unnecessary restrictions on people's daily lives."
Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said: "Our concern remains that community treatment orders could be used as an excuse to deny essential in-patient care to people who need it, while the government's agenda is reducing the numbers of psychiatric beds and days in hospital."

Checking out of 'Hotel America'
After an eventful eight years in Washington, the BBC's North America editor Justin Webb has mixed feelings about his imminent return to the UK.
If you do not like your life and you have drive and luck, you can change it because - being American - you believe you can change it "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" America was not designed to be left. The opposite in fact - it was designed to be arrived in. It was programmed to receive and - as was the case in the Eagles' song Hotel California - there is some wonderment at the front desk when you try to go. For effect, I sometimes exaggerate our sadness at the end of our time in America, result: confusion. "Our British home is in south London so we'll probably all be murdered before Christmas." "Oh, my gosh, um, why not stay?" Because you have no sense of humour, would be one answer. But it is not why we are leaving. In more than seven years of life in America, I have come to value - to love, actually - the stolid, sunny, unchallenging, simple virtuousness of the American suburban psyche. The woman who is to sell our house is a prime specimen. She is perky. Nothing gets her down, not even the fact that we are selling in the midst of the biggest depression since the Great Flood. In this area it is different. "You have a lovely home!" But she thinks we have too many books. She does not say so but she talks of creating spaces on the shelves - for snow-globes, perhaps, or silver photo frames with perfect children showing off perfect teeth. This is a cultural thing. When selling a home in America, you have to pretend that you do not live there. No, you have to pretend that no-one lives there. Or ever has. Previously owned homes are of course the norm for us Europeans. We understand that previous generations have made their mark. This means - as we English know, having grown up with rattling windows and mouldy grouting - that a home will be imperfect. They do not make such allowances in America. Illusion of safetySo the inspector's report, the survey, is the cause of much deliberation and soul-searching with our potential buyers. An outside light is not working properly. A tap is leaking. A chimney needs investigation. I feel crazy going back to the old world
As I read it, my mind turns to our house in London which is actually falling down - somebody omitted to prop up the middle when an arch was cut in a downstairs room 100 years ago - but which is still eminently saleable. The English understand that we are all falling down. Dust to dust, we intuit. Americans do not. They have not got there yet. Truth be told, I would rather be them than us. I admire the concern over the chimney and the belief that the problem can be fixed. I sit on the porch, in the growing evening heat of the Washington spring, the cicadas chirruping and the sound of lawns being mowed, and yearn to be staying. It would be so easy, so uncomplicated, so safe. And yet of course - like the perfect home we tried to create - this safety is an illusion. Route 17From Washington let me take you south 600 miles (965 km) or so to the state of South Carolina.
Charleston's many churches have earned it the nickname "the Holy City"
In the steamy heat of the night, cicadas deafening in these parts, breeze all but non-existent, I drove Route 17 south, out of Charleston and down into the low country, the salt marshes. Charleston is one of America's most elegant cities, but Route 17 is not on any tourist maps, at least not as an attraction in its own right. In a sense though, it should be. It gives a wonderful insight into hardscrabble American life, the sleazy glamour of the road that repels and appeals to visitors - and indeed Americans themselves - in roughly equal measure: gas stations, tattoo parlours, Bojangles Pizza, $59 (£35)-a-night motels, pawn shops, gun shops, car showrooms, nail bars, and Piggly Wiggly, the local supermarket chain which, in my limited experience, smells almost as odd as it sounds. It is a panorama of the mundane: Doric columns a-plenty but all of them made of cheap concrete and attached to restaurants or two-bit accountants' offices. On and on it goes, encroaching into the palm forests with no hint of apology. 'Bible-laced hypocrisy'As it happens, I am due to visit one of those forests and the following morning I find myself standing next to a black, four-wheel-drive vehicle and another quintessentially American phenomenon. A politician mired in Bible-laced hypocrisy.
Mr Sanford was a potential candidate for the 2012 presidential elections
At the time I met Mark Sanford, the governor of South Carolina, just a few months ago, I didn't know about the hypocrisy. But I should have guessed when he offered to let me in to a secret. He was a closet tiller of fields, he said, and liked nothing better than to get out with his boys and work the land. A little too wholesome to be true. Weeks after telling me that all-American story, it transpired that he was also ploughing furrows in foreign fields. The man disappeared only to turn up in Buenos Aires with an Argentine woman who was not Mrs Sanford. This from a man who, when he was a congressman, lived in some peculiar Christian fellowship house in DC. It did not stop his Doric columns from being false. Zest for lifeAnd yet for all the ugliness, the deadening tawdriness of much of the American landscape and the tinny feebleness of many of its politicians - for all that nastiness and shallowness and flakiness - there is no question in my mind that to live here has been the greatest privilege of my life. The immensity of America, the energy and the zest for life remind me sometimes of India. And as with India, where I spent some time for the BBC many moons ago, America shines a light on the entire human condition.
Few other nations really do. Italy reveals truths about Italians, Afghanistan about Afghans, Fiji about Fijians. But America speaks to the whole of humanity because the whole of humanity is represented here; our possibilities and our propensities. Often what is revealed is unpleasing; truths that are not attractive or wholesome or hopeful. On the last day we spent in our home in north-east Washington, they were holding a food-eating competition in a burger bar at the end of our street. The sight was nauseating: acne-ridden youths, several already obese, stuffing meat and buns into their mouths while local television reporters, the women in dinky pastel suits, rushed around getting the best shots. America can be seen as little more than an eating competition, a giant, gaudy, manic effort to stuff grease and gunge into already sated innards. You could argue that the sub-prime mortgage crisis - the Ground Zero of the world recession - was caused mainly by greed: a lack of proportion, a lack of proper respect for the natural way of things that persuaded companies to stuff mortgages into the mouths of folks whose credit rating was always likely to induce an eventual spray of vomit. There is an intellectual ugliness as well: a dark age lurking, even when the president has been to Harvard. The darkness epitomised by the recent death in Wisconsin of a little girl who should still be alive. Stone-Age superstitionsEleven-year-old Kara Neumann was suffering from type one diabetes, an auto-immune condition my son was recently diagnosed with. Her family, for religious reasons, decided not to take her to hospital. They prayed by her bedside and the little girl died. The night before she died - and she would have been in intense discomfort - her parents called the founder of a religious website and prayed with him on the telephone. But they did not call a doctor. If Kara had been taken to hospital, even at that late stage, insulin could have saved her. She could have been home in a few days and chirpy by the end of the week, as my son was. It was an entirely preventable death caused, let's be frank, by some of the Stone Age superstition that stalks the richest and most technologically advanced nation on earth. I deplore the superstition and the eating competitions and the tatty dreariness of so much of America, and I note that the new president is also unimpressed by the infrastructure and not a fan of fat but, after more than seven years living here, I am increasingly convinced that these elements of the nation are not the flip side of the greatness of America, they are part of that greatness. There is something about the carelessness of America that gives space for greatness. Making it bigOut on route 17 in South Carolina, you can do very well or very badly. You can crash and burn, or you can fill up with cheap petrol and ride off into the sunset. If you do not like yourself in South Carolina, you can hire a self-drive hire truck and take it to Seattle. If you do not like your life and you have drive and luck, you can change it because - being American - you believe you can change it. Ms Sotomayor grew up on a public housing estate in the Bronx
Sitting in a dingy apartment in New York watching Perry Mason on the TV, you can decide to make it big in law as eight-year-old Sonia Sotomayor once did. This summer, now in her fifties, she becomes a Supreme Court justice and the latest American story to send shivers down the spines of dreamers of the American dream. But if Sonia Sotomayor is to make it big, there must be something creating the drive, and part of that something is the poverty of the alternative, the discomfort of the ordinary lives that most Americans endure and the freedom that Americans have to go to hell if that is the decision they take. This is the atmosphere in which Nobel Prize winners are nurtured. A nation which will one day mass produce a cure for type one diabetes, could not, would not, save little Kara Neumann from the bovine idiocy of her religious parents. More than 300 million people live here now, settlers from all over the world. From Ho Chi Minh City, from Timbuktu, from Vilnius, from Tehran, from every last corner of the earth, they have made America their home and they are still streaming in. I feel crazy going back to the old world. My five-year-old daughter Clara, who is the proud owner of an American passport, agrees. She says she intends to leave home, at around 12-years-old, and return to her native land. I do not blame her. If you are willing to chance your arm, if you back yourself, if you want to live the life, America is still the place to be. Drive out on Route 17 and take a chance! So that's it from me, I am checking out. But part of me can never leave How to listen to: From our own CorrespondentRadio 4: Saturdays, 1130.

Major push for India-US relations
By Seema Sirohi in Washington
Mr Singh (left) and President Bush
The current visit of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to the United States is expected to lead to a deeper and broader strategic partnership between the two countries.
The enthusiasm among both US and Indian officials to push the relationship to a much higher level is palpable.
The Bush administration is pulling out all the stops to welcome Mr Singh to the White House to show its seriousness about engaging with India. Mr Singh will address a joint session of the US Congress - a rare honour granted to close allies - where there is bipartisan support for stronger relations.
The rise of India and China is more important than the disintegration of the Soviet Union or the unification of Germany
Robert BlackwillFormer US ambassador to India
He will be accompanied by a high-level delegation that includes Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, Deputy chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran.
The two sides are working on agreements covering science and technology, energy, education, agriculture and space and nuclear cooperation. There are also attempts to make India a base to manufacture drugs to treat HIV-Aids.
News focus on India
The push for a broader partnership with India has gained momentum during the second Bush Administration as the US builds alliances in Asia. Much of the credit for this new focus on India has gone to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her close advisers who believe India's geo-political importance is growing given its expanding economy and military strength.
Condoleezza Rice is credited with improving the relationship with India
The Bush Administration has publicly said it wants to help India become a world power.
President Bush is expected to announce US willingness to help India overcome its serious energy needs with nuclear technology - something the US has long denied India because it has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. There is, however, considerable opposition within US policy circles to treating India as an exception to the nuclear non-proliferation regime.
But the US president has been pushing for the use of nuclear energy as a way to meet the growing global demand for oil. Analysts say he may invite India to join the US as a partner in international nuclear research projects, something that Indian scientists have wanted for some time.
Business and defence ties
The two leaders are due to issue a joint statement after their official talks, outlining their vision for the future. Indian officials expect that Mr Bush will end the remaining sanctions imposed against India after Delhi conducted nuclear tests in 1998.
Defence ties are also on the agenda
Indian officials say that one of the highlights of the visit will be the newly constituted chief executive officers (CEOs) forum, which includes top business leaders from both countries.
Indian Ambassador Ronen Sen said 10 CEOs each from both sides covering a variety of industries will advise both governments on how to increase US investment in India and start joint production in the crucial defence sector. The recently concluded defence framework agreement envisages US defence corporations jointly producing and marketing weapons to third countries.
'Convergence of interests'
A report released on Thursday by the Washington-based think tank, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, recommends not only greater space and nuclear cooperation between the US and India but says Washington should support India's aspirations for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.
While US support for India's bid for a seat at the UN top table seems unlikely, there will be other concrete achievements, say both Indian and US officials.
Robert Blackwill, US ambassador to India in the first Bush administration, said while releasing the report that India was a natural partner for the US given the convergence of national interests of both countries. "The routes of the international system are changing right now. The rise of India and China is more important than the disintegration of the Soviet Union or the unification of Germany," he said.

Award winning screenwriter dies
Frank Deasy had been campaigning for more organ donors
The award winning screenwriter Frank Deasy, who had been campaigning for more organ donations, has died in hospital in Edinburgh.Mr Deasy, 49, died on Thursday in Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary, where he had been due to get a liver transplant. The screenwriter, whose screen credits include Prime Suspect, appealed at the weekend for more organ donors especially those with blood group B. Mr Deasy is survived by his wife Marie and three young children. Only organs from a donor with the B blood group, which is shared by just 10% of the population, can be used in transplants for people such as Mr Deasy who had the rare blood group. He persuaded actors who had appeared in his hit dramas to join the campaign. Among those who did was Scots actor Dougray Scott, who starred in his screenplay Father and Son. Planning workMr Deasy's his most obvious success in his campaign followed an appeal in his native Ireland last week. The day after the show was aired a record number of people applied for organ donor cards. His agent, Anthony Jones, confirmed the news of his death and said it had shocked friends and colleagues. He said: "I spoke to him only yesterday afternoon. "He was fine and already planning when he could start work again on the drama he's making for the BBC. "It was the third time he'd been called about a new liver; the first two times turned out to be false alarms and he was delighted that this time it would happen. "He was so proud of the impact he'd made, particularly in Ireland where the health minister had come onto the same radio show the next day and announced she was considering legislation for presumed consent. "That meant a lot to him. I just hope that people will continue what he started." Mr Deasy's latest project was a BBC drama called Gaza, about a secular Jewish doctor in the Middle East. Helen Mirren was due to play the central role.
