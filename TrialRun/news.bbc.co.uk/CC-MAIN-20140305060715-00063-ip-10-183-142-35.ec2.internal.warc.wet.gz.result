ICC orders Congo warlord release
Mr Lubanga has been in custody for two years
The International Criminal Court has ordered the release of the first-ever war crimes suspect to face trial before it, Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga.
The judges said Mr Lubanga could not be guaranteed a fair trial as prosecutors had withheld evidence from the defence. A prosecution appeal over his release will be heard next week. Mr Lubanga, who has been in custody for two years, denies charges of recruiting child soldiers during the Democratic Republic of Congo's conflict. Four million people are estimated to have died during the conflict in the DR Congo. Mr Lubanga led the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) militia in the north-eastern Ituri district, where fighting continued long after a 2002 peace deal. In a statement released early last year, the prosecution argued that children had been snatched as they walked to school and forced to fight for Mr Lubanga's ethnic Hema militia against their Lendu rivals. But his lawyers said he was trying to end the conflict and is being punished by the international community for refusing to give mining concessions to foreign firms in areas he controlled. The ICC, based in The Hague, was set up in 2002 as the world's first permanent war crimes court. It was designed to end the need for various ad hoc war crimes courts - including the chambers created to deal with war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and the genocide in Rwanda.

India trials stealth frigate
By Monica Chadha
BBC correspondent in Bombay
The navy already has stealth destroyers
The Indian navy's first indigenous stealth frigate has begun trials. The INS Shivalik is the first of 12 such warships the Indian navy plans to build.
Trials are being held in Bombay, also called Mumbai, where the vessel has been designed by the Naval Design bureau. The ship is fitted with state-of-the-art technology and bristles with a sophisticated system of radars and weaponry. The 143-metre-long frigate, which is over nine metres tall, is powered by two gas turbines and diesel engines to help it reach speeds of up to 32 knots. Its armaments include surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, torpedo tubes, rocket launchers and indigenously designed sonar systems meant for detecting and attacking submarines. 'Power and punch'
Attending the launch, Defence Minister George Fernandes said the war on Iraq had shown the importance of a country's navy.
If India starts exporting warships, it would be a remarkable achievement
Defence Minister George Fernandes
He said the coalition forces' warships had played a major role in victory.
He also said the fact that India had built the ship itself was a major step forward, and the country should now aim to build ships for other countries too. Navy Chief Admiral Madhvendhra Singh said developing countries like India could not afford to buy warships and it was important the country produced its own vessels.
He said the stealth frigate with its array of weaponry and sensory systems would add "power and punch" to the Indian navy. INS Shivalik was built at a cost of $140m and will be commissioned in December 2005. Email this to a friend

Backside firework prank backfires
A man suffered internal burns when he tried to launch a rocket from his bottom on Bonfire Night.
Paramedics found the 22-year-old bleeding, with a Black Cat Thunderbolt Rocket lodged inside him, when they attended the scene in Sunderland.
He suffered a scorched colon and is now recovering in hospital, where his condition is described as stable.
A spokesman for the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) said the prank could have been fatal.
Douglas McDougal, from the NEAS, said: "We received a call stating there was a male who had a firework in his bottom and it was bleeding.
"He sustained fairly significant injuries in the fact that there's huge damage to that particular area." 'Beyond belief'
Mr McDougal added: "Potentially it could have been a fatal incident.
"There's a lot of major blood vessels round that area, so infection would probably be a huge problem for him.
"And also the body naturally produces methane gas, so combine that with the firework and the exploding effect with methane's flammability - it certainly could have been a lot worse than it really was."
A spokesman for the Firework Association described the bizarre prank as "beyond belief".
He said: "We have spent a long time working with the government to create laws that make fireworks safer and better for the public.
"This incident is very concerning but hopefully an isolated one."
Northumbria Police said they were aware of the incident, which happened in the Dame Dorothy Street area of Monkwearmouth, but are understood not to be carrying out further inquiries.

Tyson wants Lewis 'tomorrow'
Brooks is preparing Tyson to meet Lewis
Mike Tyson would fight Lennox Lewis tomorrow given the chance, his trainer has claimed.
The controversial former undisputed heavyweight champion has a warm-up fight against Ray Mercer in January and will probably then meet Lewis on 6 April 2002.
But Iron Mike's trainer Tommy Brooks claimed that his fighter wanted to meet Lewis as soon as the British man took his titles back from Hasim Rahman.
"He's got his hunger back without a doubt", Brooks told BBC Radio Five Live.
"I can't imagine Mike flipping hamburgers somewhere or throwing trash cans - for his legacy he has to get his title back.
"When Lewis got the title back, Tyson said `Can I get him tomorrow?'
Tyson has a wram-up against Mercer
"That's the type of fight Mike loves to see and that makes him want to meet him all the
more.
"Mike will have just one fight before Lewis, not two as he's in much better
shape than he thought he would be at this stage.
"He realises he's not getting any younger. With maturity you start understanding things and you become a man.
"I think that is what is happening in Mike's life right now.
"He just wants to get in there. He says the belts are all borrowed, they are all his belts.
"I think he will knock him out within four rounds."

Bowditch, Tomlin and Smith pen new deals at Yeovil Town
Dean Bowditch scored ten goals for Yeovil last season
Three Yeovil Town players have agreed new deals with the League One club.Striker Dean Bowditch, midfielder Gavin Tomlin and defender Nathan Smith all agreed terms at Huish Park and will return to training on 1 July. They were among five players given a deadline by the club to accept the terms offered by the Glovers. Of the other two, midfielder Keiran Murtagh will be returning to the club after the summer break and JP Kalala has been given more time. The Congolese international midfielder is currently in France dealing with a family issue. Glovers boss Terry Skiverton told BBC Somerset: "He will be speaking to me over the next few weeks. I won't put a time limit on it as I'm a family man myself and family has got to come first. "Keiran Murtagh will be training with us pre-season and we'll see how things go from there."

Harry Carpenter
Harry Carpenter has been the undisputed voice of boxing for the best part of 50 years.
After two years in the navy, Harry originally joined the BBC in 1949 and delivered his first boxing commentary in the same year.
He mixed working for the BBC, the Greyhound Express and the Daily Mail before switching to television full time in 1962.
Harry presented the midweek sports magazine Sportsnight and also worked on BBC radio throughout his career.
His strong presentational style and his ability to laugh at his own mistakes helped endure him to the British public.
For much of the 1970s and '80s he co-hosted the Sports Personality of the Year, having first contributed to the programme in 1958.
He, perhaps, became best known for his magnetic double act with Frank Bruno, but he also enjoyed a notable relationship with the boxing great Mohammad Ali.
When Ali was honoured as the BBC's Sports Personality of the Century, Harry was among the first to congratulate the boxing great on screen.
His dedication to broadcasting was recognised in 1989 when he received the American Sportscasters' Association award and the International Sportscaster of the Year.
