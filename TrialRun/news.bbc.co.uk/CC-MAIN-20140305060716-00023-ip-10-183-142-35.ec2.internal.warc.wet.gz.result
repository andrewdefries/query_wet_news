Bali bomb burials stoke tensions
There are fears the bombers' executions could spark reprisal attacks
Indonesian security forces are on high alert after the state execution of three Islamic militants for the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people.
There were reports of clashes as hundreds of supporters attended burials in the men's home villages in Java.
Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron (Mukhlas) were killed by firing squad at 0015 (1715 GMT on Saturday).
They were found guilty of planning twin attacks on nightclubs at the resort of Kuta, popular with Western tourists.
Security forces are on alert across the country amid fears of reprisal attacks.
Australia, which lost 88 of its citizens in the attacks, has issued a warning against travel to the country. Britain and the US have done likewise.
'Welcome martyrs'
The BBC's Lucy Williamson, in Cilacap, near the prison, says the executions took place in darkness surrounded by forest and a handful of witnesses.

Prison officials, who said an autopsy had been carried out, and Haji Chozin, the brother of Amrozi and Mukhlas, confirmed the deaths.
After being washed by their families, the bodies of Mukhlas and Amrozi were flown by helicopter to their home village of Tenggulan in East Java for burial.
Samudra's body was flown to Serang in West Java.
Members of radical groups gathered, along with onlookers, in both villages to meet the bodies as they arrived.
A banner saying "welcome martyrs" was on display at the cemetery where the brothers were to be buried, reported Reuters.
There were also reports of clashes in Tenggulan between hundreds of police and supporters who had surged towards the ambulances carrying the bodies.
Foreign journalists were verbally abused as "infidels".
Continued threat
But the deaths will not evoke much sympathy in Indonesia, where most people supported the sentence and believed the executions should have been carried out much sooner, our correspondent says.
Officials had said the three would be shot in early November but no date had been announced in advance.

Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said it was "not a day that fills us with any joy or with any celebration" and that his thoughts were with the victims' families.
He warned that Australia continued to receive "credible information that terrorists may be planning attacks in Indonesia".
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said hundreds of lives had been "fundamentally changed by that murder, so it is those lives we think about today".
Victims and family members have also responded to the news.
"They had to pay the ultimate price for what they did," said Peter Hughes, who suffered severe burns in the attacks. "These guys set about mass murder."
Wayan Rasmi, a Balinese woman whose husband's body was never found following the attacks, said the executions would let her put the past behind her.
"I hope there will not be any revenge from their families and supporters," she said.
Reprisal fears
The bombings were blamed on the militant group Jemaah Islamiah, widely regarded as a regional affiliate of the al-Qaeda network, but several key suspects have never been caught.

None of the executed men had ever expressed remorse for the attacks, only saying they regretted that Muslims had been killed.
They also said they were keen to be "martyrs" for their dream of creating a South-east Asian caliphate.
However, they made several appeals for leniency and also filed an unsuccessful appeal to be executed by beheading rather that face a firing squad.
They said beheading was a more humane and Islamic form of execution and that being shot amounted to torture.
Correspondents say that while executing the men has sent a strong message, it could also put the country's hard-won security at risk if it inspires other extremists to carry out similar acts. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Spider-Man breaks DVD records
A Spider-Man sequel is set for 2004
Film blockbuster Spider-Man has broken the record for DVD sales, taking more money in its first three days on sale than the movie took in box office receipts when it was released in cinemas.
More than 11 million DVD and VHS videos were sold in the United States and Canada between Friday and Sunday, earning $190m (�122m).
Money-spinners: Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire
In comparison, the film took $114m (�73m) at the big screen box office in its opening weekend.
The home video release was boosted by Halloween promotions and by discounting by some retailers.
The film sold seven million copies in the first day alone, breaking the previous record held by Monsters Inc, which sold five million.
Spider-Man is expected to become the biggest-selling DVD of all time.
Unusually, film company Sony released the film on DVD and video on a Friday in the US, rather than the traditional Tuesday.
Worldwide hit
Sony said they decided on a Friday release so it would have two weekends on sale with no major competition from other releases.
The film was a worldwide hit, taking in more than $800m (�514m) at box offices in total.
A sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man, is scheduled for release in 2004 and will again star Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Director Sam Raimi will also return.
In the US, 43% of homes now have a DVD player and this figure is expected to rise to 50% by the end of the year.
About 20% of homes in the UK now have a DVD player - expected to rise to 25% by the end of 2002.
Spider-Man is released on DVD and video in the UK on 25 November.

Life amid the waste piles of Naples
Piles of rubbish have crammed the streets of Naples since dustmen stopped collecting a fortnight ago. After angry protests by locals forced to burn the refuse, the Italian army has begun to bulldoze it away.
Pierre Royson, 43, told the BBC News website of the hazards of life amid the mounds of waste. This is an ongoing problem in Naples. When we first got here two-and-a-half years ago it was appalling and overwhelming to see rubbish piled up the way it is. Soldiers bulldoze Naples rubbish
One forgets how in other countries rubbish gets picked up regularly.
Here, you go for a couple of weeks, the waste piles up, people gets frustrated and set it on fire. One day you wake up and it is all gone. But this has gone on for a long time now and it can seriously affect daily life. The roads are in poor repair at the best of time in Naples and with the trash occupying the space out to the centre lane, only one lane of traffic can pass. It's cars in one lane, piles of rubbish in the next. There are no pedestrian walkways, so pedestrians have to walk on the streets to get around rubbish. It's dangerous and you are constantly on the lookout for cars and scooters driving past.
Toxic fumes
There is very little recycling and obviously there is no sophisticated waste disposal system. So absolutely everything gets thrown away.
There is serious concern that with all this rubbish being burned on the streets all kinds of toxins could be going up in flames, potentially posing a health risk.
Then there is the smell. A foul odour permeates our whole house because of the burning waste. Our children were here over the past two weeks and they were exposed to it too. The piles also bring out the feral animals. Yesterday we drove to the airport and passed dozens of rubbish heaps, each one with its own band of rummaging animals. There are mostly dogs and cats, but rats make an appearance as well. The Neapolitans are a passionate people and they are understandably frustrated by these circumstances. As a result it's easy to find yourself caught up in a riot or protest. Some friends of ours tried to go through a barricade but their car was attacked and they had to turn back. It feels a bit like being besieged, but besieged by rubbish! It's like a bad movie. Everywhere you go, your way seems to be blocked by piles of rubbish. E-mail this to a friend

Bird flu: Is it still a threat?
By Caroline Parkinson
BBC News, health reporter
Winter is the time of year when people's thoughts turn to flu.
Wild birds may still be harbouring the virus
But this time last year, it wasn't the usual seasonal flu which was occupying the thoughts of doctors, the media and the public - it was bird flu.
Twelve months on, how have things changed? Are we still at risk? And are we any better placed to fight the deadly H5N1 virus?
The H5N1 virus is still around. But experts say it has been largely "dormant" in recent months.
Europe has seen no cases since the outbreak in Turkey, nor has Africa been hit by any major outbreaks since the beginning of the year.
In South-East Asia, where most cases of bird flu are seen both in animals and humans, there have been no cases in Vietnam this year, whereas it was previously a hot-spot for bird flu.
Experts say this is probably because people have learnt to restrict access to birds and so reduced infection risk, and because monitoring systems have been improved so the virus would not have the chance to spread unchecked.
Variation, not mutation
Dr Alan Hay, head of the World Influenza Centre at the National Institute for Medical Research said: "Things have been quiet for the last six months in most parts of the world.
"In Europe it has calmed right down, and there hasn't been a resurgence in Africa.
"Once people know what to avoid and what measures to take, you don't get the cases."
There is no evidence the virus has an increased capacity to spread
Dr Alan Hay, WHO influenza centre
But he said: "We don't know what's smouldering away in some part of the world we can't keep our eye on."
The fear is that the H5N1 virus will combine with a human flu virus and mutate into a pandemic strain which could spread easily between people.
There have been no indications over the last 12 months that this is any closer.
But the virus has not gone away.
It has changed, as all viruses do. And there have been cases, such as a cluster in Indonesia, where family members have contracted bird flu.
But, importantly, it was H5N1 they caught, and not a mutated strain.
Dr Hay said: "There is some evidence of variation in the strain, but there is no evidence the virus has an increased capacity to spread. We haven't seen any change."
'Don't panic'
And we are better placed to fight any pandemic which does occur.
The UK government is stockpiling doses of the anti-flu drug Tamiflu
There are several trials of vaccines against the existing H5N1 virus which are showing promise.
Professor John Oxford, a virologist at Queen Mary School of Medicine, London, said: "Things have changed tremendously over the last 12 months. "Every major vaccine manufacturing group has now got an H5N1 vaccine in production. A year ago, that didn't seem possible.
"And the stockpiles of antiviral drugs are increasing."
But Dr Hay added: "The concern is that, as winter approaches, the birds will migrate southwards towards Europe and Africa. We really don't know what they are carrying.
So how worried should members of the UK public be? The experts say they should not panic.
Dr Hay said: "There is no reason for the individual to have any reason for concern unless they're involved in dealing with birds.
"People shouldn't feel in danger. Contingency measures are in place to monitor wild birds. "And there have been very few poultry workers who have been infected and shown clinical symptoms."
It is likely that the coming months will see more cases of birds infected with the H5N1 virus. But the experts' conclusion is that the chances it will mutate into a dangerous pandemic strain are no greater than they were this time last year.

Press despair over Gaza raid
Israel's latest raid into the Gaza Strip in which at least 10 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier have died has hit a raw nerve in the region's press.
Anger is the predominant sentiment in Palestinian newspapers, with one commentator describing Ehud Olmert as "the most stupid and corrupt prime minister since the establishment of the Hebrew state".
In Israel, the press is pessimistic, doubting that the operation will put an end to attacks on Israeli territory by Palestinian militants, and one commentator calls for the reoccupation of the Gaza Strip. EDITORIAL IN PALESTINIAN AL-QUDS
What is happening in the Gaza Strip can be described without any exaggeration as a limited war in which Israel is using tanks, war planes, artillery and infantry. The scope of destruction and injuries is great... The international community is required to make a serious move because the tragedy that has been going on for so long cannot continue indefinitely.
MAHMUD AL-HABBASH IN PALESTINIAN AL-HAYAT AL-JADIDAH
There is nothing to make us think there is any chance of achieving peace with the stupid [Israeli] government that is being led by the most stupid and corrupt prime minister since the establishment of the Hebrew state. These empty-headed people think that they can impose their conditions, visions and existence on the region through the use of unjust military force. So they do not shy away from committing all kinds of crimes against the Palestinian people.
ABDALLAH AWWAD IN PALESTINIAN AL-AYYAM
The Hebrew state has never stopped its war of multi-faceted aggression and will never stop it... What is happening in the Gaza Strip is a repeat of the old occupation with some adjustments here and there, including the occupation of the border area between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. The indirect occupation of that area will turn into a direct one. EDITORIAL IN PAN ARAB AL-QUDS AL-ARABI Slaughter in Beit Hanoun... The Israeli government has been carrying out a war of ethnic cleansing in the Gaza Strip since the abduction of [Israeli soldier] Gilad Shalit last July... The most shocking thing is that the world remains totally silent, as if these actions are legitimate and Israel is above all laws. HAGAY HUBERMAN IN ISRAEL'S HATZOFE Let us assume that we have "cleansed" Beit Hanoun of all weapons - then what? Who will prevent the terrorists from building anew their arsenal of rockets after we leave? There is only one solution for the firing of Qassams: Israeli security control of the Gaza Strip, rebuilding the settlements that were destroyed and leaving the Palestinian Authority as an independent authority dealing with Palestinian civil issues in their territory. There is no other way. EDITORIAL IN ISRAEL'S YEDIOT AHARONOT Neither the government, nor the defence minister and certainly not the army harbour any illusions: The Israeli operation will perhaps make things difficult, perhaps even stop the smuggling for some time and perhaps, perhaps reduce the number of Qassams. But in the words of the song: "My God, my God, this will never stop." This is the unpleasant truth.
ISRAEL'S JERUSALEM POST
This might be the largest operation in the Strip, with a brigade-size force, since disengagement, but no one is under the illusion that this is what will end the Qassam threat once and for all... The army, like the whole country, is only just emerging from the Lebanon trauma... Those in the government and the military who were also involved in last year's disengagement are determined not to allow the IDF back into Gaza for anything more than a few days. A reoccupation would be a final public admission that the withdrawal was a colossal mistake.

Q&A: Your questions to Aleem
Aleem Maqbool feeds his donkey
BBC correspondent Aleem Maqbool answers BBC news website readers' questions about his journey on foot from Nazareth to Bethlehem.
He is retracing a journey made by Joseph and Mary in the Christmas story told by Luke the Evangelist.
Q: We would like to ask you if you are going to get another donkey, after donkey number two was turned back at the checkpoint. Perhaps you could get a local donkey, like Jesus did on Palm Sunday? Good luck! We will be following you all the way!
Class 4S (8-9 years old) Frith Manor Primary School, North Finchley, London
Dear Class 4S, Thanks for your suggestion! As you can see, I have already got myself a new donkey. She was from a village called Yabad, and in her normal life she works on a farm there. It seems she's pretty special. I am told that she gets loaded up with fruit and vegetables at her farm, and then walks half an hour to the market all by herself, and when she gets there and all the produce is taken off her back, she walks back to the farm alone again! Hopefully she will get all the way to Bethlehem with me - let's see!
Q: As a Muslim (I think, looking at your name apologies if wrong) what does Christmas mean to you?
Mo, Luton, UK
Hi Mo, Christmas has always been celebrated in my family. Tree, turkey, gifts (including santa socks) etc. Of course, Jesus is a pivotal figure in Islam. I read your question out to Nedal, my (Muslim) host this evening in Al Far'a Refugee Camp. He said, for him, Christmas was about remembering a message of peace and the things we have in common.
Q: About how many miles a day are you travelling?
Susan, West Midlands, UK
Hi Susan, It varies, but I generally plan to walk about 10-13 miles (16-21km) each day. On the first day, I got a bit carried away and did about 17 miles (over 27km), and regretted it the next day. Fortunately, the aches did not last too long, and all is well now. I am determined to walk (and very occasionally donkey-ride) every step, even if I need pain-killing injections on Christmas Eve!
Q: Are people being kind to you? Or do you feel hostile vibes anywhere?
Ryan Paul, Kenora, Canada
Hello Ryan, On the whole, people along the way have been fantastic. Going through some of the very small villages, where foreign visitors are rare, I have had some curious looks, but people have generally been very welcoming once we get chatting. There was an isolated incident in Jenin where a man shouted at me, thinking it was my intention to portray his city as backward (because I had a donkey with me!). We also had a run-in with Israeli officials ahead of crossing into the West Bank which led to our donkey having to be left behind.
Q: Would Joseph and Mary recognise anything along the route in 2008?
Sally Dando, Norfolk, UK
Hi Sally, That question has crossed my mind many times a day during the trek. In terms of man-made structures, the Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth contains what are believed to be the ruins of Mary's home, and the Church of St Joseph, the ruins of Joseph's carpentry workshop. Other than that, the Church in Burqin houses the cave where the Bible story of Jesus curing the lepers is thought to have taken place. The cave is said to have been totally enclosed except for a shaft down which food was lowered to the lepers, which you can still see today. Many here believe Jesus passed that way, and perhaps Mary and Joseph.
However, for me, it's the landscapes that perhaps offer the most tangible connection to history. The walk on Day Four, across rolling hills and olive groves from the Christian village of Zababdeh to a place called Al Far'a (when several hours passed without me seeing a car, or even a road), has been the best example, and a great experience.
Q: Can you see the stars at night? This is key to recreating that night with the Bethlehem Star, don't you think?
Jorge Enrique Telles Mosquera, Jauja, Per� (from BBC Mundo)
Hi Jorge, I have been very lucky. The skies have been cloudless every night, and the stars clearly visible. You are absolutely right, it definitely adds to the experience. My astronomy is not great though, so I have no idea what I am looking at! Promise to find out.
Q: What are you most looking forward to? Afterwards please tell me what was most interesting.
Tom Rimmer, Virginia Water, UK
Hi Tom, I was undoubtedly most looking forward to the two treks through the hills from Zababdeh to Nablus, via Al Far'a and the small villages in between - no big towns or cities, no heavy traffic, no particular political obstacles to expect. The first didn't let me down, and I hope the second one doesn't. The walks get a bit more "scrappy" after Nablus. Hope to let you know about the second part of your question soon.

Life without wires
Technology analyst Bill Thompson contemplates a future without wires, where you never have to plug in a new DVD player into the TV or hook up a digital camera to your computer.
Bluetooth headsets allow hands-free mobile calls
I was sorely disappointed yesterday evening.
On the 2151 train from London Kings Cross to Cambridge I eagerly checked my mobile phone to see which other Bluetooth devices I could find, hoping to indulge in a spot of bluejacking or bluestumbling or whatever else I could get up to, only to find that there were no other Bluetooth devices within range.
I was doubly disappointed because I had even gone to the trouble of downloading a program called bluesniff that shows what can be done to other people's Bluetooth phones, but there was nobody to play with.
It wasn't that surprising, really. Although lots of phones and a fair number of laptop computers now come fitted with Bluetooth networking, the short-range, low-power device to device network that allows earpieces to talk to phones or cameras to send pictures to computers without a cable in sight, few of us actually keep it turned on all the time.
On my phone I keep the network turned off except when I actually need it, simply because it uses a lot of battery power.
I only bother with it on my laptop when I actually want to connect to the net or transfer a file. I imagine most other Bluetooth users do the same. Important development
Unfortunately the idea of sending messages to other people's phones in an untraceable way, (bluejacking), or copying address books from strangers (bluestumbling) is such a media-friendly idea that it has attracted a lot of attention in the past week or two.
Not having to carry around a set of cables so I can link my various digital devices together is truly transforming, and Bluetooth can deliver that
This is a shame, because it might make people think twice about using one of the most interesting and genuinely important developments in the computing field for years. Forget all the talk about wireless hotspots and video phones. Getting rid of cables will change people's lives in far more important and interesting ways. And Bluetooth is the way to do it.
Imagine never having to plug in a digital camera or MP3 player again. Imagine not having to buy a �20 USB cable when you get a new printer. Imagine no more worries about how many Scart sockets your TV has when you buy a new games console to add to the VCR and DVD player piled up underneath it.
And imagine never again having to untangle the thin wires that link your headphones to your CD or MP3 player, and not ripping them apart when they get caught in your bicycle crossbars as you cycle across town, and I speak from bitter experience.
Having a wireless connection to the internet is certainly nice, but it is something I can do without most of the time. If I really need to check my e-mail, then I can use my mobile phone or a cybercafe. But not having to carry around a set of cables so I can link my various digital devices together is truly transforming, and Bluetooth can deliver that.
Home impact
The main impact for me will be when I am on the move, since I often have a mobile phone, a digital camera, a laptop and a Minidisk recorder with a microphone. Bluetooth allows you to send information over the air
But wireless links between devices will have a massive impact at home, too, if only because it will remove the need to put the DVD player underneath your TV, or your CD player next to your amplifier. And once we get Bluetooth speakers which do not need cables to connect them, then the way we think about home audio will change completely.
Perhaps the most eagerly awaited device not yet on the market is the Bluetooth iPod. Apple's portable music player, with 10,000 songs on one hand-sized device, has already become a vital accessory for any member of the digital elite. Add wireless networking and you no longer need a cable to the earpieces, and could even share the music you are listening to with friends or strangers on the bus or train.
Of course, they need to sort out the security stuff before we do all start using Bluetooth. It is bad enough having my address book stolen, but imagine if the strange man sitting next to me on tonight's train could look at the photos on my digital camera.
Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.

Children deliver paedophile protest
The petition was delivered to the prime minister
A petition against plans to house some of the UK's most notorious paedophiles at Nottingham Prison has been delivered to Downing Street. The BBC's Jeremy Ball: "Ministers knew this would be a controversial decision"The 24,000-signature petition was handed over by Natasha Crommer, 12, and Carl Britten, 9, who live near the prison. Fifty other residents joined them in the march from the House of Commons to Number 10.
One child held a banner reading "Any risk is too much".
The protesters are angered at plans to create a unit to house the worst child sex offenders after completing their sentences. The proposed unit is about 250m from an infants and junior school.
The police have assured residents that former offenders will be supervised whenever they leave the jail, but many parents in the area are still angry. Child abuse: concern for parentsHelen Goldman, a mother of twin five-year-olds, said: "I'm really concerned. My children go to the school, play in the local parks and go to the local shops - this is a really worrying thing for our community."
Earlier the protesters met James Clappison, Conservative front bench Home Affairs spokesman. He said: "There are a lot of legitimate questions which need answering about this."
The BBC's Eve Conway: "The protesters attracted considerable attention"The residents plan to continue campaigning to try to prevent the proposed unit being opened. Several people have camped outside the prison in protest.
The scheme is the first of its kind, and could be extended nationally if successful.

Army photos: Claims and rebuttals
Ever since the Mirror newspaper published photos of British soldiers allegedly torturing an Iraqi prisoner their authenticity has been questioned.
Army sources, former commanders and army intelligence officers, and the Royal Military Police's Special Investigation Branch have questioned their veracity.
The paper claims British soldiers handed over the photos
On Friday the Daily Mirror conceded the pictures were a hoax and editor Piers Morgan resigned.
The Mirror had earlier defended the testimony of the two soldiers, known only as A and B, who gave them the photos.
Read on for a list of key claims and, where given, the rebuttals they stood by for two weeks.
1. Claim: The wrong type of Bedford truck is shown in the background - a type never deployed in Iraq. Some have also said it is too clean. Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram told the House of Commons on Thursday : "The truck in which these pictures were taken was never in Iraq."
See the full image
Enlarge Image Rebuttal: Soldier A previously told the Mirror: "It was a four ton truck, I'm not sure what make. We always used that sort of truck when we were on raids as did other units."
On the cleanliness claim he said: "That's the way it was." 2. Claim: Sources close to the Queen's Lancashire regiment believe the rifle is an SA80 mk 1 - which was not issued to troops in Iraq. The rifle would have had a carrying sling attached. Some experts have said they believe it's a replica.
Rebuttal: Soldier A told the Mirror: "I was carrying an SA80-A2. I think the one in the picture is that model as well. I can't explain why it may not be. Some soldiers wore rifle slings, many others didn't." 3. Claim: The condition of the weapon is "pristine", whereas it would be scuffed and dirty if it had seen action. It also has no cover over the barrel and no identification number on the butt. Rebuttal: Soldier A said: "We cleaned our rifles all the time. It could have been cleaned that afternoon."
See the full image
Enlarge Image 4. Claim: The army doesn't use potato sacks as hoods, but dark room curtains. The hood was too clean and "ironed" for something that would have been crumpled up in someone's pockets.
Rebuttal: Soldier A told the Mirror: "I can't answer that. That was the hood the man had on." The paper claims to have seen another picture of a different arrested Iraqi, in which the 'sandbag' hood appears to be identical.
5. Claim: "Why would the soldier be wearing webbing that is undone? Normally soldiers are very particular about that," said former commander Colonel Bob Stewart.
A Queen's Lancashire Regiment soldier said "it is highly irregular on a professional soldier" to leave pouches open.
Rebuttal: "On raids, kit wasn't the issue. We had also returned to our compound, the soldier might have removed stuff," soldier A told the Mirror.
6. Claim: The stream of urine does not look authentic. Among the claims are that shadows have been added to the drops of urine, that the wet patch on the hood is fake, and that the droplets are coming from a bottle of water.
Rebuttal: None provided.
7. Claim: Col Stewart threw doubt on the captive's "slightly silky" football shirt, bearing an Iraqi flag. "Is that the sort of shirt that a captive might be wearing?" he said.
Other analysts have said the shirt would be out of place in the Shia area of Basra.
Rebuttal: "We saw dozens of Iraqis wearing exactly those t-shirts," soldier B told the Mirror.
See the full image
Enlarge Image 8. Claim: Soldiers tie laces in a parallel, rather than criss-cross, fashion.
Rebuttal: The Mirror pictures soldier with boots laced criss-cross. Soldier A said: "I think people lace the boots the way they are most comfortable with."
9. Claim: Soldiers operating in this area wouldn't tuck their trousers into their boots, but would leave them outside with an elasticated bottom to stop sand getting in.
Rebuttal: None provided.
10. Claim: The shirt would be sweaty, dirty and dishevelled after alleged beatings. There are no bruises or marks on the captured man. Rebuttal: Soldier A told the Mirror: "The man was wearing some sort of Arab dress over his t-shirt and it was ripped off during his arrest." See the full image
Enlarge Image 11. Claim: Regiment sources say soldiers wear berets or hard hats, not floppy hats.
Rebuttal: Soldier B said: "We wore floppy hats all the time. A beret was too hot, helmets cumbersome."
12. Claim: The captive's posture does not suggest he is being tortured. The body would be curled up, legs pulled into the foetal position. "It is not the posture of someone who has suffered pain," said Col Stewart.
Rebuttal: Soldier A said: "That's how he was. His arms were tied behind him."
13. Claim: Divisional markings should have been visible under the flag on the soldier's left sleeve.
Rebuttal: The Mirror pictures two other soldiers serving in Iraq, also with no divisional markings on their sleeves. Soldier A told the paper: "We weren't going around sewing badges on."
14. Claim: Experts have questioned the sharp quality of the photos - former Guardian picture editor Eamonn McCabe compares them with the fuzzy, badly composed pictures of American soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners, published earlier. The Mirror's pictures are "all too clinical" to be trusted, he said.
Rebuttal: None provided

Sark considers democracy
Land on Sark was passed to eldest sons for centuries
The last feudal constitution in the western world is introducing elections to comply with United Nations human rights legislation.
The elections will change a system dating back to Queen Elizabeth I, who once granted the ruling "Seigner" a fief on the tiny Channel Island of Sark.
Unelected descendents of 40 families brought in to colonise Sark, after the French abandoned it in 1553, have governed life on the island ever since.
Islander Richard Dewe helped draught a review on the future constitution of the island in advance of a final recommendation expected in March.
We would like to retain an element of the feudal system at least by name
Islander Richard Dewe
He told BBC News Online: "This has been brewing for years now... we realise that human rights are needed.
"But whether landowners will stand for election and take the risk of not being voted in is the crux of the matter.
"They have always been safeguarded and could make unpopular decisions without risking their position.
"That would all change if there was an elected legislature."
There are currently 52 members of Sark's ruling body, 40 of them hereditary landowners called "chief pleas".
In 1922, 12 elected members called "deputies" were also introduced.
Several options
That number will rise when the final proposal for further change is announced in March.
But not everyone on Sark could end up with a vote.
Free elections for the whole population is only one option, and the others include the landowners being elected by their peers.
Mr Dewe, 65, said: "We would like to retain an element of the feudal system at least by name.
"Not all the property owners see their duty as running the island... some of them own property but do not live here."
"A lot of people from outside see politics as 'them versus us', but I did 30 years as a deputy and I have never seen a split vote." See also:

JK to launch Potter 6 at castle
JK Rowling will launch the sixth Potter book with an exclusive reading at Edinburgh Castle, it's been revealed.
The author will read from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in the great hall of the castle minutes after midnight on Saturday 16 July.
It will be broadcast on television and radio stations around the world.
And best of all, 70 junior reporters, aged between eight and 16, will be in the audience and will all meet JK and have a chance to quiz her on the book.
Check out our MEGA Potter section
Selected English-speaking newspapers from around the world will run competitions to find the young journalists. The papers will be in Britain, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
They will meet JK Rowling after her reading, be presented with a signed copy of the book, and then go to a special reading room at Edinburgh Castle to whizz through the much-awaited novel.
Bookshops
Then the reporters will get to ask JK questions about the book at a special children's press conference on Sunday 17 July.
The selected newspapers will run competitions from 14 May, and bookshops and libraries in the Republic of Ireland will also run them. Another competition will be on publisher Bloomsbury's website.

Parry calls for Reds resolution
Parry (centre) flanked by Gillett (left) and Hicks
Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry has called on the club's co-owners to quickly resolve the Reds' future.
On Friday, George Gillett revealed his partnership with fellow American Tom Hicks had become "unworkable". Parry is pleased that the admission brings the situation to a head but insists immediate action is needed. "If they're not able to co-exist then there needs to be a solution where one buys and one sells, or both sell," Parry told 5 Live's Sportsweek.
Interview: Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry
"There aren't too many other possibilities but it's pretty clear that to carry on with the status quo is going to be extremely difficult." 606: DEBATE
Tough times ahead if Hicks and DIC work together I don't think the relationship between the two will be strong
LfcOzzi
He continued: "There is no question that to succeed you need unity at the top, unity at the club, and everyone pulling in the same direction. "Without that, it is extremely difficult to progress and it is clear from George has said the unity is not there. "George has been pretty unequivocal in what he has said. You have to think he thought long and hard before coming out with the statement he made on Friday, it did not leave room for doubt." Dubai International Capital (DIC) recently failed in an attempt to buy into Liverpool, with Hicks refusing to do business unless he can retain a controlling share. Gillett appears to be open to offers and claimed DIC would be "responsible" owners. Whatever happens, Parry wants does not want the situation to drag on. "I think it brings it to a head - clearly for the good of the club," he added. "It's dragged on for long enough. The ideal would be to move to as speedy a resolution as possible." Former Liverpool captain Tommy Smith said the ownership saga had damaged the club's image. "It is a bit of an embarrassment because Liverpool don't hang their washing in public. "I think there was always going to be a problem with the two of them getting involved," Smith commented. But Peter Crouch, the club's England striker, told the BBC's Sportsweek programme that boardroom issues were not distracting for the team. "It is not great when you hear things about the club changing hands but as players we are paid to play. "When you are on the pitch you are not concerned about who is running it at the top end, you are concerned about the team in front of you," he said.

Sports Personality in Sheffield
The 2009 BBC Sports Personality of the Year will be hosted in Sheffield for the first time in the show's history.
