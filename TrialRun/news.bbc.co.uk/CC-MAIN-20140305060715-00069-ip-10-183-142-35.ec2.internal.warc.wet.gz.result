Hague rallies troops for 'huge task'
William Hague: Jobs crisis ahead
To see and hear William Hague's conference speech click here from 15.30 BST (14.30 GMT).
Nick Assinder reports from Bournemouth:
Tory leader William Hague is planning a "realistic" end-of-conference speech in which he will confess he has failed to enthuse the voters.
BBC Political Editor Robin Oakley on William Hague's attempt to stir his troopsIn his most important speech since being elected leader after the Tories' general election pounding, he will tell delegates "the hostility on the doorsteps has gone".
But he will also admit that the party has a huge task ahead of it to create any enthusiasm among voters.
He will call on the government to create a jobs crisis package immediately, with the abandonment or postponement of the minimum wage and statutory union recognition.
And he will map out plans for a radical policy on the constitution which could see the creation of an English parliament to echo the new assemblies in Scotland and Wales.
Man of the people
Mr Hague will attack what he calls the government's "betrayal" of dropping welfare reform and suggest it is the Tories who are the party of compassion and fairness.
He will also attempt to put the row over Europe finally behind him by talking only about the reforms he wants to see within the EU, such as tackling the jobs crisis.
And he will claim that next year's local, European and devolution elections will give the Tories a solid bedrock on which to build their recovery.
Mr Hague will again seek to paint himself as a man of the people by referring to his Yorkshire, comprehensive school upbringing.
Labour to blame
In a key section of his speech, he will tear into Labour over the looming economic crisis: "The only thing Labour ministers know about the economic downturn is that they're not to blame.
"In July, Gordon Brown announced his spending spree and his forecasts for the economy. We all knew those forecasts were wrong. Most economists knew they were wrong. Francis Maude told the chancellor they were wrong.
"I asked Tony Blair at Prime Minister's Question Time whether he accepted that the forecasts were wrong. 'No' he said, with supreme complacency.
"This week we discover they are completely wrong. Grim, but wholly predictable news for families and businesses throughout the country.
"It's clear to everyone now that Labour has been living in a dream world. This week they got a reality check.
"What we have seen in the last year and a half amounts to a major reversal of the economic policy of the last government, the policy which built the golden legacy which this government is squandering.
'Mock concern'
"We are facing a jobs crisis in this country. The people who are paying the price for that reversal are the thousands of people who have already lost their jobs and the hundreds and thousands of people who could lose their jobs unless this government gets its economic policies right.
"No amount of scripted sympathy and mock concern from the government is going to lessen the impact on families around Britain this autumn.
"What we need is an emergency jobs crisis package. And I today propose one to the prime minister.
"We oppose the minimum wage because it will price people out of work. If the government is not going to abandon it, then they should at least consider delaying its introduction until the jobs crisis is over.
"We oppose statutory union recognition because it will open the door to strikes and bankruptcies. We're still at the White Paper stage. If the government is not going to scrap them, then they should at least consider not bringing them before Parliament until the jobs crisis is over.
Demand for statement
"We believe it was a total betrayal by the government to abandon real welfare reform. The chancellor's proposed spending plans mean that welfare bills will soar, interest rates will be higher than they should be and the pound will be higher than it could be.
"The government should at least consider drawing up new plans that tackle welfare spending and lessen the impact of the jobs crisis.
"What I am proposing is a practical, do-able, implementable, sensible jobs crisis package.
"It is a package this government can introduce now to protect British jobs," he will say.
He will also demand an emergency Commons statement on the issue from Gordon Brown when MPs return from their summer break later this month.
"If he doesn't introduce such a package, let's be absolutely clear about one thing - he will be responsible for yet more lost jobs and factory closures.
"Dithering as jobs are destroyed. That's what happens when you believe in everything and believe in nothing."

Quiz: Three Cs of reporting
You are a reporter on a children's newspaper. Your job is to write news stories or copy. This means you have to pay close attention to the words you use. 1. Your editor tells you he only has space in the paper for a short story about a fox mistaken for a wallaby. That means you have to get all the facts what, who, where, when and why into just two sentences. Which of these will your editor prefer? a) A 'wallaby' that had been spotted hopping around Cardiff was in fact just an injured fox. The first person to report seeing the fox on Thursday thought it was a kangaroo or a wallaby, because it had hurt its leg, causing it to hop. b) On Thursday, a wallaby was spotted hopping around Cardiff. But it turned out to be a fox with an injured leg. c) Wallabies are usually found in Australia, not Wales, so when one was spotted in Cardiff the residents didn't know what to make of it. But the mysterious animal turned out to be a fox that was hopping because it hurt it's leg. 2. When you are writing for children it is important to make your report easy to understand. You can do this by making your sentences short and simple. How would you write about this thrilled Manchester United fan? a) A Manchester United fan celebrated his team's win by covering himself from top to toe in paint which was red in colour. b) A Manchester United fan celebrated his team's win by covering himself from top to toe in red paint. c) A Manchester United fan celebrated his team's win by painting himself red from top to toe. 3. Accuracy is very important. This means you have to choose individual words with great care. The wrong word could even land you in trouble with the law. Which of these sentences would you use to describe this bus crash? a) Three passengers were seriously injured when their bus hit a tree b) Three passengers were seriously injured after their bus hit a tree. c) Three passengers were seriously injured because the bus driver hit a tree 4. Journalists have to show they get their information from reliable sources. Otherwise who will believe what they write? Which of these sentences would you use? a) A man from Yorkshire holds the record for the largest number of pegs on his face. b) A man from Yorkshire made it into the Guinness Book of Records for clipping the largest number of clothes pegs on his face. c) A Yorkshireman has clipped a record-breaking number of pegs onto his face. 5. When you are writing down what people say it is important to use quotations. You have started a story about a new Blue Peter presenter. So far you have written: Zoe Salmon has leapt into her new role as the 30th person to become a presenter on TV show Blue Peter. The 24-year-old will take over from current presenter Liz Barker while she has a baby, and then will stay on the team when Liz comes back. Now you want to add a quote but how to you let your readers know Zoe is speaking? a) "I'm so excited and I'm really looking forward to all the mad stuff I know they throw at you on Blue Peter," said Zoe. b) Zoe said: "I'm so excited and I'm really looking forward to all the mad stuff I know they throw at you on Blue Peter." c) "I'm so excited," said Zoe, "and I'm really looking forward to all the mad stuff I know they throw at you on Blue Peter." 6. Avoid stating the obvious. Your readers don't want to be told what they already know. Which of these sentences should you use? a) With sirens blaring, fire engines rushed to put out the blaze. b) Fire engines raced to put out the blaze. c) Fire crews were at the scene of the blaze within minutes. 7. People use words in different situations. In a children's newspaper you wouldn't use technical sounding words or jargon. It is better to use words you put in a letter about the story to a friend. Which of these sentences would you choose? a) The man died from his injuries. b) The man sustained fatal injuries. c) The man sustained terminal injuries. 8. Some words look very similar and are often confused like affect and effect. Here's a good way to remember this: The e in result stands for effect and the a in make a difference stands for affect. Which of these sentences is correct? a) Many children are affected by allergies which can have a negative effect on their health. b) Many children are effected by allergies which can have a negative affect on their health. c) Many children are affected by allergies which can have a negative affect on their health. 9. It is important to spell correctly. Spellings of some words have different meanings like curb and kerb. Which of these sentences is correct? a) Buses which lower themselves to the curb at bus stops have been designed to kerb the number of accidents involving wheelchair users and young children in push chairs. b) Buses which lower themselves to the kerb at bus stops have been designed to curb the number of accidents involving wheelchair users and young children in push chairs. c) Buses which lower themselves to the kurb at bus stops have been designed to cerb the number of accidents involving wheelchair users and young children in push chairs. 10. It is important to follow the rules of the language you are using. In the English language, people are responsible for what happens but things aren't. Which of these sentences would you use? a) A fire killed a teenager in Newcastle. b) A teenager from Newcastle was killed by a fire. c) A teenager died in a fire in Newcastle.

BBC SPORT | Tennis | Britain's Becker?
HomeNewsSportRadioTVWeatherLanguages
[an error occurred while processing this directive]
Low graphics|Help
By Colin Moffat
Braehead Arena, Glasgow
Murray won his first ATP title in San Jose in February
Davis Cup veteran John Lloyd believes Scottish teenager Andy Murray has the ability to reach the highest level and in doing so revolutionise tennis in Britain.
The Dunblane youngster's meteoric rise has already made a significant impact north of the border.
For the first time in 36 years a Davis Cup tie is taking place in Scotland, due largely to his involvement.
And last year's televised Scotland v England clash for the Aberdeen Cup would have been unthinkable were it not for the 18-year-old.
"It's been the problem in Britain for years that the public generally think of tennis as just Wimbledon," Lloyd told BBC Sport.
"And after a couple of weeks of excitement the public interest goes back into hibernation. We have to get the message out that tennis is a year-round game. "It helps when you get stars in your own country and, if Andy Murray becomes the player I think he will, I think he's going to generate an unbelievable amount of interest in the sport.
"I really believe he has the potential to emulate what Boris Becker did in Germany because kids will always want to copy stars.
"He will have to win big tournaments to keep up that momentum and I believe he will.
Wimbledon, great tournament that it is, in some ways has been detrimental to the game's growth
John Lloyd
"Okay, we had Tim Henman - and don't get me wrong - Tim has been a great example for British tennis, but Andy brings something different to the table.
"He has a more obvious appeal for youth in this country.
"And if we can get a few more kids taking up tennis then we have a larger talent pool and our sport will get bigger and better, and I really think Andy can help do that."
Murray missed the first day's play of the Davis Cup with Serbia and Montenegro due to illness.
But he wasn't afforded much rest at court-side in the Braehead Arena as long queues of children mobbed him for autographs - which he willingly provided. "Another problem for the game is that is has an upper class image," continued Lloyd.
"And Wimbledon, great tournament that it is, in some ways has been detrimental to the game's growth.
"With the strawberries and cream and the ivy, a lot of people think it's out of their range and expensive.
"Andy Murray can change that because he doesn't view it as the ultimate event and talks about other tournaments.
"We need to stress that tennis is not such an expensive game. We can all play it and it's a wonderful family sport. It's a game for life."
