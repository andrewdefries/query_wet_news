New generation embraces mobiles
By Jane Wakefield
BBC News Online technology reporter
A new generation of mobile users are becoming so emotionally attached to their phones that they cannot live without them.
Children are the most sophisticated users of phones
This is one of the key findings of a study into how people use their mobile phones entitled Me, My Mobile and I.
The annual study from research firm Teleconomy reveals that 10 to 14-year-olds - dubbed M-Agers - are rapidly becoming the most sophisticated users of phones.
Even toddlers are able to tell the difference between incoming phone calls and text messages said Professor Michael Hulme, chairman of Teleconomy.
Socially acceptable
ME, MY MOBILE AND I
26% say they couldn't live without mobile
18% refuse to admit the importance of the mobile in their life
32% see phone as tool rather than intimate object
24% say wouldn't miss mobile if it was taken away
85% of children had personalised phones
For children, phones are not so much about communication as a device for downloading things such as pop news, games and ringtones.
"These M-Agers are very clued up on phone functions. They want highly functional phones and they give them a high degree of personalisation," said Prof Hulme.
Phones are rapidly replacing trainers as a social marker.
"The phone plays a role in the playground and can be a ticket to entry into certain groups," he said.
In some cases the phones themselves are becoming 'virtual playgrounds', as children fill their free time with texting their friends and playing games.
In denial
Youngsters are also far more aware of the more sophisticated uses of phones, with 71% aware of video-calling compared to 54% of adults.
About two-thirds knew about Java applications like games, while only 44% of adults were aware of this function.
This will all be great news for operators keen to push more and more services on phones.
"They are growing up ready to take on these services," said Prof Hulme.
The study found that adults were more ambivalent about their phone use, with a growing number of people (18%) in denial about how much they need their mobile phones.
"The denier believes the myth that they are in control of the device but when we spoke to them it began to dawn on them that they were not," said Prof Hulme.
"This group represents a field day for the network providers as they put themselves on tariffs too small for their needs and then go drastically over their free minutes and text allowance," he added.
Objects of desire
For a quarter of the population, their relationship with their mobile was more honestly assessed - they admitted that they just could not live without it.
Some people refuse to admit the importance of their mobile phone
"These people have their phone on 24 hours a day. They are frightened of missing a call because to not be available is to cut oneself off from one's social network," said Prof Hulme.
Phones are rapidly replacing address books, diaries, watches and alarm clocks as people turn increasingly to their handsets to help manage their lives.
They are also becoming photo albums as people personalise their handsets with things dear to them, such as pictures of friends and family.
"One woman who liked a drink had a picture of a pint of beer on hers," revealed Prof Hulme.
There are lessons here for manufacturers concentrating on making phones as smart and function-filled as possible.
"There are actually more pragmatic ways of making money," said Prof Hulme.
These include increasing the amount of space for storing texts, giving more indication of where calls are coming from and a better way of ordering all the information people are increasingly storing on phones.
The Me, Myself and I study conducted 1,400 interviews between February and April including questionnaires, face-to-face interviews, focus groups and telephone surveys.

How can we stamp out racism?
Updated 28 July 2003, 16.16
A massive festival aimed at stamping out racism is being held in London. It's been dedicated to the memory of A-level student Stephen Lawrence, who was killed in a racist attack in 1993. His mum reckons there are still "too many excuses" for racist behaviour. We want to know what you think about the issue - and how you think people from different races and backgrounds can live together in harmony. There is no possible way to stop racism. No matter what happens there will always be arrogant people.Brittany, 13, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA
There is no excuse for it. Racism is a very big problem in our country and people need to be taught that it is wrong. What difference does it make where you come from or what you look like. We're all humans and we all should be treated the same.Rhonwen, 13, Carmarthen
It is wrong to bully others because they are of a different culture to you, and I think that the only way that it can be fully stopped is to expand the idea of a non-racist country in schools, and to continue teaching about different cultures in RS lessons.Srinjoy, 13, Abingdon
At my school I'm part of a group which is called REC and it stands for Racial Equality Council. We do plenty of things to bring each other together no matter the colour of skin. We do lots of things like presentations to teach other students and have parties for different religion celebrations like Christmas and Eid. We won an award for all the work we had done, also. Its just different concepts that people have about one and other but when we get to know each other then its fine. I think that more people should be open minded about it and see inside the person and not just look at the skin colour.Nicola
The first thing we need to do is we need to stop scaring racist people. It sounds stupid, but the more we scare them about how we are going to put them in jail... the more they attack.Sarah, 14, Bristol
I think racism will not stop until people stop thinking in colour. Instead of saying that black girl or white or Chinese. Why not say she has long hair etc.Keera, 13, Bristol
I don't understand why anybody is a racist. It's pointless and stupid. People who are racist probably don't know very much about the people they're hating. I think that these people believe that being this way puts them above everybody else, but in reality they are only lower.Kim, 14, Montreal
Unfortunately, I think no matter what we try to do, racism won't stop. I know it's sad to think that, but it's the truth. As long as we have thick-headed, conceided, bigoted people in this world that demand power, we aren't going to learn any more than we want to.Liz, 14, NY, USA
I think one of the ways to stamp out racism is by teaching your future children that all races are equal.Rodrigo, 14, El Salvador, Central America
I don't think we'll ever stomp out racism. It'll always be there because it's been there for so long! It's a hard issue to deal with, and some people just wont listen. If we do stomp it out then brilliant! But I think it'll be almost impossible.Moe, 14
It partly depends on where you live. When I lived in London, white people stayed together, black people stayed together and (well, you get the idea.) But now I live here, we all mix. We shouldn't be trying to target the problem in general. We should try to recognise the problem in each area and target that individually. Schools shouldn't try to put so much emphasis on not being racist. This is drawing our attention to it. If they didn't mention it, then we wouldn't notice it.Hazel, 12, Cambridge
I think schools should teach students more about how bad racial abuse is because racism is one of the main causes of bullying.Rachel, 14, Bury
What IS the point of racism, really? Is it just some dumb idea to make us feel superior? Frankly, racism has no point. But others are still keeping racism a daily issue in the world, and we need to stop it! I mean, racism isn't nice, it isn't fun, it isn't anything good! Katherine, 12, USA
I think the best way to deal with racism is to just learn to respect other people's beliefs, if nothing else. If you don't agree with someone's beliefs, then just keep quiet.Helen, 11
To stamp out racism, we must try to open people's minds more, and help them understand that diversity is not something to be feared, for it is a way of life.Lyra, 13, Belfast
At my school I'm part of a group which is called REC and it stands for Racial Equality Council. We do plenty of things to bring each other together no matter the colour of skin. We do lots of things like presentations to teach other students and have parties for different religious celebrations, eg Christmas and Eid. Michelle, 14, Stoke on Trent
Racism is pathetic. It doesn't matter what race you are - you are still human.Vicki, 15, Northern Ireland
I feel that in lessons such as RE we should be told about other cultures in a way that we can all understand. Aliesia, 12, London
Racism is a very big problem all over the world and for it to be reduced I think that not only should different cultures work together, but people of the same beliefs.John, 14, Bolton
People tend to pick fun at the different. They need to see we're all different, even if our skin colour, our accent or clothing may be the same.Emma, 15, Yorkshire
I have some great friends, all are not of my culture, and we get on like a house on fire! Why can't people just get a grip on life, it's not the prehistoric ages any more - there is such a word as 'friends'. Can't we live by this word?
Gin Wah, 14
I think we should treat people exactly how we would like to be treated. I don't care if they are black, white, African or Asian. It's what's on the inside that counts - don't judge a book by its cover.Lucy, 12
I think people who are racist should be punished because it is stupid to judge people by their race. We learnt about racism in school and everyone in my class agrees that it is wrong! Nuala, 13
I think people need to do more to understand each other's backgrounds. My friends are all different races and we get on brilliantly. Sophie, 14, Bristol

Sportsday Live will resume on Thursday at 0800 GMT.1840 FOOTBALL: John Terry will not stand aside as England captain and intends, if selected, to captain the team at their next friendly against the Netherlands in February, reports BBC Sport's Richard Conway.
The BBC has also learned that after Terry's first hearing at West London Magistrates on 1 February, the case is likely to be adjourned for 8-10 weeks. Fabio Capello and the FA will therefore be forced to make a decision over Terry's inclusion in the squad for the game against the Dutch with the Chelsea player understood to be unwilling to stand down while the legal process is on-going.1835 FOOTBALL: Liverpool players have released a statement in support of Luis Suarez
who was banned for eight games and fined after being found guilty by the FA of racially abusing Patrice Evra.
"Luis Suarez is our teammate and our friend and as a group of players we are shocked and angered that he has been found guilty by the FA," said the statement. "We totally support Luis and we want the world to know that. We know he is not racist."1831 SKIING: Croatia's Ivica Kostelic claimed his 20th career World Cup victory when he won the slalom at Flachau, Austria. Kostelic led after the first run and finished in an aggregate time of 1 minute, 48.94 seconds to beat second-place Andre Myhrer of Sweden by 0.07 seconds. Cristian Deville of Italy was another 0.02 behind in third.1800 OLYMPICS: As the 2012 London Olympics and Paralympics gets ever closer, you can watch a timelapse sequence
showing the construction of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford.1744 FOOTBALL: Benfica say former star Eusebio has been admitted to a Lisbon hospital after displaying early symptoms of pneumonia. The 69-year-old, who was born in Mozambique when it was still a Portuguese colony, became known as the Black Panther for his performances in the 1960s for Benfica and the Portuguese national team. He scored 41 goals in 64 games for Portugal and has since been a "soccer ambassador" for Benfica and Portugal. 1740 FOOTBALL: Former home secretary and Blackburn MP Jack Straw has called on Blackburn Rovers to sack manager Steve Kean. Straw told BBC Radio 5 live: "All of us have been extremely patient with the owners and with Steve Kean. But having been at the game on Saturday and after listened to the one last night I think that there is no option as far as the owners are concerned but to ask Steve Kean to leave." 1733 RUGBY UNION:Premiership clubs will have all their England stars available for the festive programme after national coach Stuart Lancaster waived his right to demand they be rested.1730 RUGBY UNION: Northampton and England full-back Ben Foden

The Australia Under-20 international had 18 months remaining of his current deal but has earned his new contract after impressing manager Alex McLeish.1651 FOOTBALL: Bolton manager Owen Coyle believes his captain Kevin Davies has been "trying too hard" to drag the Trotters out of the relegation mire and says it is the reason why he was dropped from the team for Tuesday's Premier League game against Blackburn. "Kevin has been trying too hard," said Coyle. "He is Bolton through and through and I know what this club means to him. He has taken extra responsibility as captain and is trying to do everything himself. It detracts from his terrific strengths."1633 FOOTBALL: Five Chile players have reportedly been fined and suspended for 10 matches by a disciplinary tribunal for arriving late and drunk to the team hotel before World Cup qualifying matches. Jorge Valdivia of Palmeiras, Jean Beausejour of Birmingham City, Gonzalo Jara of West Bromwich Albion, Carlos Carmona of Atalanta and Arturo Vidal of Juventus, were in "a state of alcoholic intemperance" when they returned from a night out before matches against Uruguay and Paraguay in November.1624 FOOTBALL: The League Managers Association has issued a statement with regards to Steve Kean and Blackburn Rovers. They talk about the treatment of the Rovers boss saying: "It is very sad to witness the continued demonstrations by Rovers fans towards their manager.

Throughout his career John Terry has played in some extraordinary situations already, under all kinds of pressure, and come through it. As a footballer you seek sanctuary on the pitch. It's the one place where you can get away from it all, you don't have time to worry about it. He will be fine."1545 FOOTBALL: There will be action on the football field tonight too, and Phil Dawkes will provide an in-depth live text on the BBC website from around 1845 GMT, describing all the action from seven Premier League matches, including Manchester City at home to Stoke and Manchester United's trip to Fulham.1540 FOOTBALL: Meanwhile, Reuters are reporting that CSKA Sofia defender Kostadin Stoyanov faces a ban of up to two years after he failed a drugs test.

1453 FOOTBALL: The Daily Telegraph's Henry Winter
on Twitter:
"FA in a moral maze. Do they allow Terry to remain England captain while case ongoing? Having taken such a strong stance on Suarez..."
1450 FOOTBALL: BBC Sport's Dan Walker
on Twitter:
"CPS can impose maximum fine of £2500 if Terry is found guilty so it'll be down to the FA to take 'real' action. Significant days."1440 FOOTBALL: A statement from Chelsea FC following the news that skipper John Terry is to be prosecuted. "John has made it clear he denies the charge. Chelsea FC has always been fully supportive of John and will continue to be so. The club finds all forms of discrimination abhorrent and we are proud of the work we undertake campaigning on this important issue. Chelsea will not be commenting further on the subject while the legal process runs its course."1432 FOOTBALL: John Terry statement following the news he is to be prosecuted: "I am disappointed with the decision to charge me and hope to be given the chance to clear my name as quickly as possible," he says. "I have never aimed a racist remark at anyone and count people from all races and creeds among my friends. I will fight tooth and nail to prove my innocence. I have campaigned against racism and believe there is no place for it in society."
1428 GET INVOLVED: John Glenn on Twitter:
"If John Terry is convicted, it could have a hugely beneficial effect on behaviour on sports fields. #bbcsportsday"
1422 FOOTBALL: BBC Sports Editor David Bond, speaking about the breaking John Terry news on BBC Radio 5 live
"Ever since they've been briefing that a decision was coming you got the sense they wouldn't be building it up if they were going to drop it. There must be some new evidence. What we've seen in the public domain is inconclusive. It's extremely difficult for England and the FA. My understanding is that they won't suspend him and will let the case take its course. There is a precedent of course. Steven Gerrard was charged with affray in 2008 and he continued to play for England. It's hugely disruptive. England's next game is in February against Holland and he could be in court earlier in the month. The FA will hope it's cleared up by then."1418 FOOTBALL: Alison Saunders, Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, said: "I have today advised the Metropolitan Police Service that John Terry should be prosecuted for a racially aggravated public order offence following comments allegedly made during a Premier League football match between Queen's Park Rangers and Chelsea on 23 October 2011. The decision was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and after careful consideration of all the evidence I am satisfied there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute this case. Mr Terry will appear before West London Magistrates' Court on 1 February 2012."
1416 FOOTBALL: The Crown Prosecution Service authorises John Terry's prosecution.
1408 GET INVOLVED: Tom Irwin on Twitter:
"Should Terry get more than Suarez on the basis that the FA can't use the language barrier as a complication? #bbcsportsday"

Plus if there are any other sporting issues you might wish to debate, please do so and get involved in Sportsday Live via Twitter with the hashtag #bbcsportsday
1402 GET INVOLVED: Christopher Lanceley on Twitter:
"I'm a LFC fan and if I actually believed he'd made comments worthy of an 8 match ban I'd not want him playing for the club at all. #bbcsportsday"1355 FOOTBALL: Brighton manager Gus Poyet tells Uruguay newspaper Ultimas Noticias that Luis Suarez's eight-match ban is "incredible" and says he backs his fellow Uruguayan "to the death".
1352 GET INVOLVED: Tom Lynas on Twitter:

1348 GET INVOLVED: Get involved on Sportsday Live on Twitter with the hashtag #bbcsportsday
1346 FOOTBALL: Safe-standing areas are unlikely to be introduced at Scottish Premier League side Inverness in the near future, according to the Highland club. Executive chairman Kenny Cameron said: "I voted in favour of the principle of safe-standing pilot schemes so that any SPL club who wishes can bring one forward and was very conscious that this is something that fans all over Scotland have been calling for."1341 FOOTBALL: Andre Villas-Boas admits Chelsea's interest in Bolton and England defender Gary Cahill but insists they are yet to make a bid for the centre-back. "We are aware of Gary's contractual situation," Villas-Boas said. "He's an interesting player for the club."
1336 FOOTBALL: Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas on John Terry: "I'll be fully supportive of John Terry and whatever the outcome of the situation he has my support and he has the club's support. We know exactly his human values and personality and for me they are never in doubt."
1331 GET INVOLVED: Sulaiman Hafez on Twitter:
"38 league games (1 season) as BRFC manager - Steve Kean has a record of 7W-11D-20L, total 32 points, we are doomed if he stays #BBCSportsday"1327 FOOTBALL: Tranmere manager Les Parry has told his players to win their next two games as they look to end a six-game losing streak. 1321 FOOTBALL: Chelsea's match at home to Fulham on 26 December will go ahead as planned at 1300 GMT
despite the planned tube strikes. 1315 FOOTBALL: Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp has criticised the fans who subjected Blackburn manager Steve Kean to "horrific" abuse during Blackburn's 2-1 defeat against Bolton on Tuesday night. "I have never seen it like that. That is horrific to stand and take that," Redknapp said. "I heard people saying that the players weren't trying or weren't making the effort for him. That's absolute nonsense, a load of rubbish." 1307 FOOTBALL: Blackburn favourite Kevin Gallacher believes the abuse directed at manager Steve Kean is made worse due to the club's owners' absence from Ewood Park. Gallacher said: "If a decision is going to be taken, who will take it and who will say what has been done. Are the owners actually going to come over from India or just carry on regardless and try to get the wage bill down?" 1300 GET INVOLVED: Rob on Twitter:
"If the FA don't punish John Terry the same way as Luis Suarez then are they being racist? #bbcsportsday"1250 FOOTBALL: News now of a former Chelsea player, Arjen Robben, now with Bayern Munich, who has apologised to fans for falling to the ground too easily in a recent away win at Stuttgart, in which Claudio Molinari was sent off. "It was stupid," Robben says. "It was probably a penalty, but I should have fallen earlier. I shouldn't do things like that, and I apologise."1245 FOOTBALL: Chelsea have denied Andre Villas-Boas had former player Tommy Langley removed from the club's in-house television channel. Langley branded the manager "petty", "vindictive" and "unprofessional" over allegations he had prevented Nicolas Anelka and Alex from parking their vehicles in the first-team car park after they had been banished from the squad for handing in transfer requests. The Blues insisted the decision to dispense with long-serving pundit Langley while an internal review was undertaken was made by senior editorial staff and was not forced by Villas-Boas.
1241 GET INVOLVED: Matthew Ho on Twitter,
presumably an Arsenal fan, and certainly not a fan of Wayne Bridge, linked this morning with a loan move to the Gunners: "Wayne Bridge on loan? No thanks. I wouldn't mind [Nedum] Onouha though. #bbcsportsday"
1235 FOOTBALL: More about tomorrow night's big London derby between Spurs and Chelsea at White Hart Lane, which you can hear live from 2000 GMT on BBC Radio 5 live
and, in addition to Gareth Bale, the home side have doubts over skipper Ledley King, who is rated 50-50, and striker Jermain Defoe, who has a twinge in his hamstring. Winger Aaron Lennon is definitely out because of hamstring trouble.

Suarez debate, which is live now: "It certainly seems there are grey areas in this case. The way the FA have ruled it seems they are saying it is an open and shut case. Liverpool have come out very strongly, unprecedented really, the strength of their statement. That says to me they have serious doubt about the quality of the evidence. It's come as a shock, the hardline decision the FA have taken. The evidence doesn't appear to be absolute. The FA seem to be taking a stand against Fifa, waving their hands about, saying we're taking a stand against racism."

Pakistan, chasing only 103 to complete a 2-0 series victory after the Tigers had a dramatic collapse and were 234 all out, are 37-1.
0915 FOOTBALL: Tim Vickery, BBC South America football expert, on 5 live's
Suarez debate, which is live now: "There's a clear case for punishment in the Luis Suarez case. But I don't think there would be [as much fuss in Uruguay]. I wonder if the Football Association are playing to the English gallery here."
0910 GET INVOLVED: Ashley Ramdenee on Twitter:
"The FA once again putting their weight about to make a statement. Nothing for Evra who admitted saying something back? #bbcsportsday"
0905 FOOTBALL: More now from Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor who has been speaking to BBC 5 live about Suarez: "It's equally important that when players come to this country from other countries in the world that they appreciate that whilst we are very culturally diverse, very cosmopolitan, that's it's also a job for the PFA and the FA and the clubs themselves to educate them in not just the rules of the game but what's acceptable as the law of the land, and what isn't acceptable both on and off the pitch."
0902 FOOTBALL: A quick word to tell you that BBC Radio 5 live
will be devoting the next hour to discuss the Suarez situation with Clarke Carlisle, chairman of the PFA, and Graham Hunter, Spanish football journalist.
0900 GET INVOLVED: Darren Smith on Twitter:
"The FA need to disclose findings today. Emotive subject and too much hearsay in the public arena #bbcsportsday"
0900 GET INVOLVED: James Lee on Twitter:
"Thank goodness the FA has taken a strong line on this. Too many national FAs have taken too soft approach. At last well done #bbcsportsday"0855 FOOTBALL: West Brom's Jonas Olsson says there is no rush to sign a new contract. The defender has 18 months of his present deal remaining and slammed reports from his native Sweden indicating he would not sign a new deal until after the Euro 2012 finals because he was targeting joining a bigger club. "I don't really like it when people take an article from another language and try to translate it, especially taking bits and pieces out of context," he says. "I can definitely see myself extending contracts but, like always when you're negotiating contracts, there are bits and pieces that need to come together and it's an ongoing process."
0850 FOOTBALL: Former Blackburn captain Jason Wilcox speaking on BBC 5 live about the unrest at Ewood Park: "The club's been in turmoil since the new owners took over. I do feel for Steve Kean. The owners had a vision and promoted a young manager, but they must either sack him or back him in the January transfer window with £25-30m. There is no transparency within the club, that's why the fans are frustrated.0847 SWIMMING: A depressing tale from Australia, where three-time Olympian and Commonwealth Games champion swimmer Phil Rogers has had many of his medals stolen from his home during a daylight break-in. The 40-year-old Rogers, a former breaststroker, said Wednesday that thieves made off with an Olympic medley relay bronze medal from Atlanta in 1996, two Commonwealth Games gold medals, two world championship gold medals, two Pan Pacific golds and Rogers' Order of Australia medal. He said the medals had no monetary value but "they're of tremendous value to me because it's 20 years of hard work."0845 CRICKET: With Ricky Ponting being retained, Australia have dropped Phillip Hughes and Usman Khawaja
for the Boxing Day Test against India, the first of a four-match Test series. 0840 GET INVOLVED: Brian Sim on Twitter:
"If John Terry is also found guilty of racism will the FA come down as hard on one of their own? #bbcsportsday"
0835 GET INVOLVED: Doorey Saloojee on Twitter:
"Well done to the FA, setting an example for world football, have no idea why people are having sympathy with a guilty man #bbcsportsday"
0830: Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor has also been speaking to BBC 5 live about Suarez and Patrice Evra: "I tried to get the two of them together as I didn't want it to escalate like it has, but I wasn't able to. They must have very compelling evidence. This whole thing is about treating people equally."0820 CRICKET: Staying with our national summer game and Bangladesh look set to lose the second Test with Pakistan in Dhaka.
The Tigers resumed 114-5 and survived a truncated opening session due to fog without losing a wicket. However, they lost their final five wickets for 22 inside 13 overs leaving Pakistan requiring only 103 to seal a 2-0 series victory.0818 CRICKET: You will be have to be quick but Australia coach Mickey Arthur will be on BBC Radio 4 at 0825 GMT discussing the squad for the India Test series, with former skipper Ricky Ponting retaining his place.
0815: David Davies - former Executive Director of the Football Association has also been speaking to BBC 5 live about Suarez: "This has been one of the most difficult disciplinary cases of modern times for the reasons around language and cultural issues. The FA has been at the forefront of fighting racism over more than a decade, and using football to do so - perhaps way ahead of Uefa, let alone Fifa. Yes, they've got to be consistent, but they've also got to be fair and right."
0810: Lord Herman Ouseley, chair of Kick it Out, football's equality and inclusion campaign, gives his thoughts on the Suarez issue: "It remains to be seen whether the Football Association will main its tough stance and its consistency that is needed to see this through. All players playing in our jurisdiction know what standards are expected. No-one is saying he's a racist, he's probably a very nice guy. He's alleged to have made abusive comments and that's the basis on which it was considered."
0800: Liverpool midfielder Lucas with a message of support for team-mate Suarez on Twitter:
"@luis16suarez fell very sad for you my friend but we are here to support you."

1984: Jayne Torvill and Christopher DeanAfter their Olympic success, the skating duo turned professional for nine years, staging a series of successful ice shows.
In 1994, they returned to competitive skating but, amid controversy, could only manage bronze at the Winter Games in Lillehammer.
They turned pro again in 1995, but these days act as choreographers for other skaters.
