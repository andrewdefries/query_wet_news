How low interest rates affect you
During the first half of 2002, the Bank of England interest rate has been stuck at 4%. It has not been that low for almost 40 years. BBC News Online's personal finance reporter Sarah Toyne examines how ordinary savers and borrowers will fare.
What happens to mortgages?
During 2001, interest rates fell from 6% to 4% in a series of seven rate cuts. Somebody on a �100,000 interest-only mortgage who has benefited from the full 2% cut will now be �166.67 better off each month, according to mortgage broker, Charcol..
That is the equivalent of saving �2,000 each year.
The cuts should be welcomed by anyone on a standard variable rate mortgage, tracker or discount deal as these type of deals are tied to base rate fluctuations. But if you are on a fixed rate, you will not benefit from the cuts.
When will my repayments reduce?
Whether your repayments will reduce immediately will depend on the generosity of your mortgage lender. Halifax and Intelligent Finance, both from the same stable, have previously responded within seconds of the Bank's interest rate decisions to say they would match the cuts. In general, such lightening speed is pretty unusual. Most banks and building societies typically respond to a base rate cut with the announcement that they will cut savings rates. This is because they must pay interest to savers, while they collect it from borrowers. Will I notice a difference straight away? Even if your lender has cut your rate, you may not notice any difference for some time. One factor to consider is if you pay for your mortgage via "annual review". If you pay under "annual review", your monthly payments are calculated once a year. The bank won't cut my mortgage rate?
As the rate cuts have intensified, a number of banks and building societies have said they would not pass on the full quarter point cut to mortgage holders because they wanted to protect their savers.
This argument is often backed up with a statistic that there are seven times as many savers as borrowers. This statistic neglects the fact that many people have more tied-up in debt than in savings and that many banks will be paying as low as 0.1% on savings accounts.
As Paula John, editor of Your Mortgage magazine, says: "The argument (presented by some lenders after the cuts in October) that they have to look after their savers is spurious given that the average instant
access account pays less than 1% interest."
What about savers?
A cut in base rate usually means less income for savers. Those most likely to suffer from a base rate cut are people who rely on fixed incomes, such as pensioners. Savers who have signed up for high-interest internet savings accounts will also feel the pinch.
Will I pay less on my credit card?
While it is standard practice for mortgage lenders to move their rates in line with base rate changes, other credit providers do not yet respond in this way - although there is growing pressure on lenders to do so. This means that if you have an overdraft, credit card or store card you are unlikely to benefit from cuts - unless you switch to a better deal.
There are some cheap credit card rates on the market, but there are also some extortionate cards which charge up to 30% interest - 30 times the cheapest ones. Easy ways to give yourself a pay rise

'Captive' Belgians found in Iran
The two Belgians disappeared in south-east Iran
Two Belgian tourists who disappeared in south-eastern Iran at the weekend have been found and are in good health, Belgium's foreign ministry has said. It said the mother of one of those missing had been in touch with him.
The ministry said Belgian diplomats in Iran were doing everything to reach and help the pair.
There is no word on why they went missing. The ministry did not confirm the two had been kidnapped, as reported by Iranian officials on Monday.
"The mother of one of the two people was in contact with her son this afternoon," the ministry said in a statement. "She said he was safe and in good health, and it was the same for the other person."
The pair were named on Belgian TV as Stefaan, 28, and Carla, 36, from the Flemish region, without their surnames being given. They had disappeared near the town of Fahraj, near Bam, Iran's state news agency Irna reported on Monday. Bam governor Majid Etemadi told Irna that they went missing on Sunday and a search for them was launched. The area is used by gangs smuggling drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan. Armed smugglers have clashed with Iranian security forces there before. E-mail this to a friend

Keeping Channel traffic in check
Ferries at Dover contribute to the high traffic on the Channel
The English Channel is often cited as the world's busiest waterway, yet collisions remain remarkably rare.
At almost any time of the day, the small stretch of water linking Britain to mainland Europe is teeming with vessels of all sizes.
While it is best known for ferries between England and the coast of France, much of the traffic using the Channel is passing north-south.
A traffic separation scheme, similar to a dual-carriage roadway, operates in an effort to keep on-coming vessels from colliding.
The "central reservation" widens where there is a sandbankIn the "carriageway" nearest the Kent coastline, ships proceed in a north-east to south-west direction. In the channel closest to the continent, vessels run in the opposite direction.
The channels are marked out with buoys and light vessels - small, metal vessels anchored to the sea floor, which emit a glowing light.
Passing traffic must maintain a "safe distance", while Dover-Calais ferries and other cross-Channel traffic,cut through the two lanes at right angles.
"They would monitor nearby vessels in the manner of normal seamanship, using radar and keeping an open view of the water," said a spokesman for Trinity Lighthouse Service.
In addition, from 1 July this year it has been mandatory for
vessels passing through the Dover Straits to report their name, position and destination to coastal authorities.
"There is no doubt that Channel safety has improved since the separations
scheme was brought in," said a spokesman for the London-based International Maritime Organisation.
"There used to be about 20 incidents a year in the Channel and this figure
has now much reduced. The reporting instruction means that ships can be much more accurately tracked on radar."
Deaths at sea
Last year a consignment of ortho-xylene - a solvent - spilled into the Channel when two tankers collided where vessels pass in and out of the traffic separation zone.
One of the worst Channel tragedies of recent years happened in June 1993, when a BP oil tanker, the British Trent, was rammed by a South Korean-crewed bulk carrier in thick fog off Ostend.
Nine people died in the accident, including four British seamen.
At the inquest, the coroner said the collision would not have happened if the bulk carrier had observed fundamental rules.
A string of accidents in 1991 included the death of six fishermen who were killed in April when their trawler, the Wilhelmina J, was hit by a tanker in the channel.
In August five fishermen died when the trawler Ocean Hound was hit by a larger vessel.
The following month, two crewmen were killed when their boat was struck by a Dutch tanker in the western approaches to the Channel.
The English Channel occupies a significant place in British history, both as a route for, and barrier to, invaders of Britain from the Continent.
In the 20th Century, the Channel's traditional fishing industry has declined with the development of deep-sea fishing, exhaustion of fish supplies and pollution.
Southampton and Le Havre have lost trans-oceanic passenger business, but gained container ship and oil-refining capacities.
Ferry traffic, for both freight and passengers, has been hit with the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994.

Police chief urges alcohol action
Peter Fahy said the price of alcohol should be raised
A chief constable has called for a ban on drinking in public areas outdoors to help combat underage alcohol abuse and anti-social behaviour. Peter Fahy, of Cheshire police, spoke after three boys appeared in court charged with the murder of a man on a street in Warrington. Mr Fahy also said the legal drinking age should be raised from 18 to 21.
"Alcohol is too cheap and too readily available and is too strong. Young people cannot handle it," he said.
'Social responsibility'
The chief constable said he wanted to reverse the situation whereby public drinking was legal unless councils voted to ban it in specific areas.

He said: "I would like to see the emphasis change the other way, where we say drinking in public is not permitted apart from those areas where a local community, local authorities say 'yes, in this particular park, this particular location, people can drink'.
"It's that sort of thing which starts changing the popular culture, which starts getting the message across."
Mr Fahy condemned parents for "turning a blind eye" to their children's underage drinking and anti-social behaviour saying "a hardcore" of parents "abdicated" their responsibility.
The chief constable said alcohol was fuelling a wave of violence and disorder across the country and that treating the issue of anti-social behaviour by teenagers as a problem for police to solve alone "was naive" .
"We are doing everything we can, within our resources and powers, but it is not enough," he said. Britain should act "as a nation" to beat the "scourge of anti-social behaviour by young people", he added.
The chief constable said the price of alcohol should be raised
He called for those who sell alcohol to young people, "those who promote alcohol as glamorous" and "teenagers who ignore the rights of others to live without intimidation or abuse" needed to "rack their conscience" and consider their duty.
The problem was not with extended pub licensing hours, he said, but with shops and supermarkets which sold alcohol to underage youths who then congregated outdoors in groups.
He wants police to be given powers to order groups of rowdy young people home and to see an increase in the price of alcohol. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme raising the age limit to 21 would send "a clear message about the dangers" of drinking.
But Home Office minister Meg Hillier dismissed the idea of raising the drinking age.
She said: "People are getting hold of alcohol under 18. If we raise the age to 21 it's not going to stop people managing to get hold of alcohol.
"We have this attitude that it's OK to go out and get plastered, publicly and privately.
"It's not something that government or legislation or the police alone can solve; it's much more of an attitude in society.
HOW MANY UNITS?
One unit is considered to be 8g of alcohol
One small glass of wine, half a pint of beer or one pub measure of spirits usually contains one unit
Some stronger beers and lagers may contain as many as 2.5 units per half pint
Cans of beer/lager often contain about three-quarters of a pint and so will contain 1.5 units
British recommended maximum limits are two to three units of alcohol a day for women and three to four units for men
BBC Healthy Living: Alcohol
"In the end, the buck will stop with parents," she said.
The Portman Group, set up by drinks manufacturers to promote responsible drinking, says raising the legal age could lead to more unsupervised drinking by young people and an increased risk of accidents and anti-social behaviour.
Chief executive David Poley said: "If 18-year-olds are allowed to smoke, vote and go to war, they should also be trusted to drink.
"We can curb alcohol-related problems through more effective education, greater parental responsibility and tougher enforcement of the law on underage sales."
Mr Fahy spoke after the death of father-of-three Garry Newlove, 47, who died after approaching a group of youths in Warrington, Cheshire. Four teenagers have been charged with Mr Newlove's murder. Two teenagers remain in police custody for questioning. E-mail this to a friend

Royal Armouries in US expansion
This 16th Century helmet is among the Royal Armouries' exports
Britain's Royal Armouries, which houses the nation's collection of arms and armour, has opened a permanent branch in the US. It has forged links with Louisville, Kentucky, famous as the birthplace of boxing champion Muhammad Ali.
Part of the new Frazier Historical Arms Museum is devoted to 300 items borrowed from collections in the UK. The Royal Armouries has sites at Leeds, the Tower of London and at Fort Nelson near Portsmouth, Hampshire.
Alan Green, the chairman of the Royal Armouries, said: "Our relationship with the Frazier Museum offers a wonderful opportunity to share our historical links with the widest possible audience."
The items on display in Louisville present the military history of the British Isles from 1066 to the early 1900s.
The collaboration between the two museums also marks the launch of the American Friends of the Royal Armouries, a charitable offshoot created to attract new funds.

Felipe Massa
Oportunidad de oro
Nacimiento: 25/04/81
Pa�s: Brasil
Equipo: Ferrari
Debut: Australia 2002
Mejor resultado: 4�
Posici�n 2005: 13� (Sauber)
Equipo anterior: Sauber
Felipe Massa est� frente a una oportunidad �nica en el 2006 como segundo piloto de Ferrari.
A pesar de que sus resultados en F1 no han sido llamativos, la escuder�a italiana lo valora considerablemente, hasta el punto de encomendarle la responsabilidad de sustituir a un experimentando Rubens Barrichello.
Massa lleva m�s de dos a�os trabajando con Ferrari como piloto de pruebas, por lo que conoce la intimidad del equipo y est� conciente de su labor dentro del mismo.
Sin embargo, Ferrari prefiri� no invertir a largo plazo cuando s�lo le ofreci� un a�o de contrato.
La raz�n se debe a que Massa se ha mostrado veloz, pero tambi�n ha cometido muchos errores.
Con un auto de punta, el piloto brasile�o podr�a animar en los lugares de arriba de la clasificaci�n, pero deber� lograr algo m�s que un buen resultado para garantizar su futuro en Maranello.

The movie is 400k and should take no more than 2 minutes to download over a 56k modem.
It is designed to be played on computers with at least a 400Mhz processor and users with slower machines may experience performance problems.
If the game appears to be running slowly try closing down any other applications you may be running.
If the game becomes unresponsive click anywhere within the game area. Click here to go to our help page if you have any questions or problems about using the Flash plug-in. Test legend WG Grace hates one-day cricket and he has stolen the Champions Trophy to try to get the event cancelled.
Your mission is to get the trophy back in time so the Champions Trophy can go ahead...
Avoid the obstacles as you make your way to the warp at the top and watch out for that demon spinner Wayne Shorn.
