US food supply 'vulnerable to attack'
By Simon Cox
BBC Radio 4
Professor Larry Wein warned that milk could be an easy target
When Tommy Thompson stood down as US health secretary in 2004, he delivered a stark warning.
"I, for the life of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply, because it is so easy to do," he said.
Why was he so worried? Is "agro-terrorism" - attacking farming or the food supply - really so easy?
The only reported case in the US happened more than two decades ago in 1984, when a cult poisoned salad bars at a number of restaurants in Oregon. Forty people were taken to hospital, no-one died.
Mr Thompson had probably been listening to academics like Larry Wein, of Stanford University, who studies terrorist attacks that could kill more than 100,000 people.
Prof Wein found milk was particularly vulnerable to an attack. If someone were to put just 10 grams of botulinum toxin into a milk tanker, it could have devastating effects.
"If we didn't realise what was happening, half a million people would drink this milk... most of these would be poisoned, roughly half of them would die," he concluded.
Scary stuff, but critics said this was preposterous: obtaining even a tiny amount of toxin was a lot harder than Prof Wein suggested.
But the US government took his paper seriously. They called it a "road map for terrorists" and stopped its release. It was eventually published a month later.
Industrial scale
If someone were going to target the food supply, Kansas would be an obvious place to start.
They could poison our feed stuff, water - I hate to even talk about it, we don't want to educate the terrorists
Mark Fisher, Kansas farmer
It is smack in the middle of the 100 mile-wide US beef belt, which produces 80% of the nation's beef.
Many of the cattle are raised on feed lots, huge expanses of land divided into fenced off dirt plots.
Mark Fisher runs one of these in Dodge City, where he farms about 18,000 cattle. This is industrial farming on a scale unheard of in Britain.
Mr Fisher is an active player in Agro Guard, a kind of "neighbourhood watch" for farmers.
They may be a hundred miles from the nearest big city, but he believes terrorism is a real worry.
"They could poison our feed stuff, water - I hate to even talk about it, we don't want to educate the terrorists," he says.
Disease outbreak
It is not just the farmers who are worried. Kansas State University is about to open a $50m Biosecurity Research Institute that will look at threats to agriculture - both natural and from extremists.
Dr Jerry Jaax, a former biological warfare specialist, has switched to studying agro-terrorism.
His biggest fear is a deliberate outbreak of foot and mouth disease, or FMD as they call it here.
"It doesn't have to be a terrorist - it could be a teenager with an attitude, a credit card and a passport," he says.
Kansas State University is bidding to be the home for a new federal bio- and agro-defence facility, a project that comes with $500m in government funding.
To secure such projects you need a big hitter in Washington - and Kansas has Senator Pat Roberts, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
He believes tackling agro-terrorism is part of the global war on terror.
'Pork-barrel' politics
Some farmers wonder whether the threat is being talked up to get a slice of the huge budget now spent on national security.
"Political influence has a tendency to take tax dollars and put it into certain areas that isn't for the good of society but makes somebody better off," says Donn Teske, president of the Kansas Farmers Union.
We also have to be vigilant in who's handling our food
FBI agent Craig Watz
Mr Teske - who is a rare breed in the state, an organic farmer and a Democrat - believes the money going into protecting the food supply is a classic case of "pork-barrel" politics.
"Congressmen are notorious for that... they want to bring pork back to their area so they can be re-elected," he says.
Mr Teske may be sceptical, but agro-terrorism is not just the paranoia of a few farmers and academics. It is a big issue nationally.
Next month, Kansas City will host the second international conference on the subject.
The head of the FBI will be there, as will the US attorney general and senior law enforcement officials from the US and around the world.
Craig Watz, an FBI special agent who runs the agro-terrorism conference, says that when he talks at lunches or dinners, he emphasises how people need to change the way they think about food.
"How many people thought about the safety or security of food, who handled it, who prepared it, where it came from?" he asks.
"We do have to be vigilant not only getting on an airplane or in buses or train systems, but we also have to be vigilant in who's handling our food."
Security priority?
Before 11 September 2001, the US never thought about terrorism. Now it can't stop.
In Washington, analysts like John Feffer, of the magazine Foreign Policy in Focus, believes the government is scaremongering.
In the UK, foot and mouth led to the slaughter of 6.5m animals
"What does sell is a threat perception, fear is what sells, unfortunately that's what agro-terrorism feeds into," he says.
And what of the UK? The Americans I spoke to assumed that, having experienced foot and mouth in 2001, the British would be worried about agro-terrorism too.
When I called Defra, the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, they could not find anyone who knew what it was.
After contacting the Home Office and London's Metropolitan Police, I ended up at the National Counter Terrorism Unit.
They told me: "We do not make public comments regarding specific threats, current intelligence or policy matters."
The security services do not appear to think attacking the food supply is a terrorist priority. Let us hope they are right.
The Silent Terrorist will be broadcast on Tuesday, 22 August 2006 on BBC Radio 4 at 2000 BST.

Analysis: Indonesia's Islamic radicals
Anti-US protests began before the bombing By the BBC's Richard Galpin in Jakarta
Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim nation, has a wide range of radical Islamist groups - many of which have close links with similar militant organisations throughout the Muslim world. Some Indonesian radicals may be linked with international terrorism. We have sent between 100 to 200 people each year to Afghanistan, to be trained to be good soldiers for Islam
Al Chaidar,Darul Islam
United States Government officials have warned on several occasions that their "war on terrorism" could be extended to include Indonesia and other countries in south-east Asia. Even before American warplanes began bombing Afghanistan, Muslim extremists in Indonesia had taken to the streets.
They threatened to burn down the US embassy in Jakarta, kill the ambassador, and forcibly expel thousands of Westerners living there, if fellow-Muslims in Afghanistan died as a result of American military actions.
Although small in number and on the margins of a generally tolerant society, the radical Islamic groups have become much more outspoken and visible. Rhetorical threats
Habib Rizieq Syihab the leader of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) - which has several thousand members and a reputation for attacking bars and nightclubs - has demanded an end to diplomatic relations with Washington.
Laskar Jihad: Fighting a "holy war" in the Moluccas
"As long as there is no evidence linking Osama to the 11 September attacks in the United States - and he has sworn he is innocent - then he is not guilty," he said. "So when he called for a Jihad for the truth, we accepted his call."
But the threats by the FPI and the other radical groups have remained rhetorical. The radical Islamists are divided over strategy and objectives. But senior US officials fear they may have links with international terrorist organisations such as Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda. 'Al-Qaeda link'
At the beginning of this year, according to the US, al-Qaeda set up a cell in Indonesia.
And in recent weeks, one Indonesian radical organisation, Darul Islam, has made some startling statements. The behaviour of the Islamic Defenders Front has been the same for years - attacking bars and brothels and so on
Harold Crouch,International Crisis Group Its spokesman, Al Chaidar, openly claims to have strong links with the Taleban in Afghanistan.
"Every year since 1989, there has been co-operation in military training, and we have sent between 100 to 200 people each year to Afghanistan, to be trained to be good soldiers for Islam. He says that assistance from an international network of Muslim extremists - including al-Qaeda - flows into Indonesia. This, he says, is primarily to help local Muslim fighters continue their Jihad or holy war against the Christian community in the Moluccan islands in eastern Indonesia. But many observers in Indonesia are sceptical, including Harold Crouch, director of the International Crisis Group in Jakarta which has produced a report on local extremist groups.
"It is of course possible that money has gone into bank accounts here. The real test is whether there's anything in the behaviour of radical groups in Indonesia that can't be explained, and which requires us to say that there must be some kind of external force behind those people," he says.
"And the behaviour of the Islamic Defenders Front has been the same for years - attacking bars and brothels and so on."
Internal conflict
The conflict between the Christian and Muslim communities in the Moluccan Islands, or Maluku, which has claimed thousands of lives since 1999, is another reason why the US has been turning its attention to Indonesia. Bin Laden: "Knew nothing about religion"
The fighting has brought to prominence to another radical Islamic group, Laskar Jihad - regarded as perhaps the most extreme of these organisations. It has trained thousands of men and sent them to Maluku to fight against the Christians. In Laskar Jihad's compound, near the city of Yogyakarta in southern Java, television and music have been banned and women wear the burqa. The leader, Jafar Umar Thalib, says that in the 1980s whilst studying at an Islamic college in Pakistan, he joined the Afghan Mujahideen in their war against the occupying Soviet forces. A senior official from al-Qaeda promised us some funding and training, as long as we followed his organisation's ideology
Jafar Umar Thalib,Laskar Jihad
He says he met Bin Laden, but did not want any dealings with him because Bin Laden "knew nothing about true religion". And he says that distance has been maintained ever since, despite some very recent offers of assistance.
"About three months ago a senior official from al-Qaeda came to visit us in our headquarters in Ambon in the Moluccan islands. He promised us some funding and training, as long as we followed his organisation's ideology," Jafar Umar Thalib said.
"But we found out that they are from a different sect which is not in line with true Islam. So we threw him out and said that if we caught him again in Indonesia, we'd help the authorities to expel him from the country."
Under pressure
Whatever the truth about the alleged links between these groups and al-Qaeda, the government says it is now carrying out its own investigation. And there are concerns that extremist groups across south-east Asia may be co-operating with each other. Over the past two years there has been a series of terrorist attacks in Indonesia. The former defence minister, Yuwono Sudarsono, says last year's bomb attack on the Philippines ambassador in Jakarta for example was probably the work of the Filipino radical group Abu Sayyaf.
So far, there is little that can be said for certain about links between local Islamic extremists and radical groups around the world. But the Indonesian Government knows it is under pressure to either disprove the American allegations, or take tough action against the extremists on its own soil.

Japan annual whale hunt 'halved by activists'
By Roland Buerk
BBC News, Tokyo
Anti-whaling activists aim to prevent the hunt from going ahead Japan's whaling fleet has revealed how much anti-whaling activists disrupted the annual hunt off Antarctica.The ships have returned to port with just over half as many whales - 507 - as they had set out to catch. Whalers said they were angry, and blamed what they described as "violent interference" from the anti-whaling Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Clashes at sea between Sea Shepherd and the whaling ships paralysed the hunt for 31 days. The last ship of the whaling fleet to return home sailed into Tokyo bay, with much of the hunt's catch in her hold. The whalers had set out late last year to kill nearly 1,000 whales in the waters off Antarctica, but they caught 506 minke whales and one fin whale. It is the smallest catch for years. One of the Sea Shepherd activists, Peter Bethune, is awaiting trial in Japan after boarding a harpoon ship and trying to perform a citizen's arrest on her captain. Prosecutors have charged him with five crimes. If convicted he could go to prison. Commercial whaling has been banned worldwide since 1986 but Japan justifies its annual hunt as scientific research. Meat not used for study ends up in restaurants and shops.

How Japan's Uniqlo is defying recession
By Mariko Oi
Reporter, BBC News, Asia Business Report
Uniqlo's brand of cheap clothing has captured the imagination
Bargain shoppers have flocked to clothing discounter Uniqlo, making it one of the most profitable retailers in Japan.
"It's not that we're selling well, others are just doing badly," laughs Tadashi Yanai, the CEO of Japan's Fast Retailing - parent company of budget clothing brand Uniqlo. Sounds humble, as the company reported a double-digit rise in quarterly profit and lifted its sales forecast on Thursday. "But we have always operated as if we are in a recession - making sure our costs are low, even when the economy was in a better shape," Mr Yanai added. Cautious attitude
His cautious attitude is based on the many economic ups-and-downs that he has experienced since setting up Ogori Shoji, which later changed its name to Fast Retailing, at the age of 23 in 1972. We want to have stores in every Asian country, where we see stronger growth than in the US or Europe
Tadashi Yanai, chief executive, Fast Retailing
But it was during the Asian financial crisis a decade ago, when Uniqlo built its reputation by selling cheap clothes to cash-strapped consumers. Now, history is repeating itself as the country battles another recession. Uniqlo has seen its sales rise 13% in the last six months. What differentiates Uniqlo from other budget clothing brands is its mega-hit products. Products such as "Heattech" (heat-trapping inner wear for winter) and "Bra top" (singlets with built in bra-style support) have sold millions around the world. Rich man
Not surprisingly, investors are in love with its stock, and it has risen by 20% on the Tokyo stock market in the last year, while the benchmark Nikkei average has fallen by a similar amount. The success of the brand recently made Mr Yanai the country's richest man - he is now worth $6bn (£4bn). But it has not always been an easy journey. Fast Retailing had bitter experience after the last recession six years ago. As the Japanese economy recovered, people ditched Uniqlo and went back to more famous and more expensive brands. Poor sales forced the company to close most of its Uniqlo stores in Britain and in China in 2003. But as Japan, the world's second largest economy, faces a shrinking population and the worst recession in over three decades, it is increasingly crucial for Fast Retailing to aggressively expand its business overseas. Overseas expansion
Uniqlo wants to expand the brand overseas.
Uniqlo now has a worldwide network of 54 stores outside Japan. And despite the global downturn, it is opening two new stores in Singapore, and is now eyeing India and Russia. "We want to have stores in every Asian country, where we see stronger growth than in the US or Europe," says Mr Yanai. "We are not here to compete with cheaper clothing stores of the region. But we offer quality clothes at affordable prices." "We also represent Japan. I believe Japanese youth has the world's number one casual fashion sense, so we want to bring that to Singapore and to Asia," he adds. Low prices
Will Japanese shoppers still shop at discount stores after the recession?
But how can Uniqlo continue to sell its products at such affordable prices? "We have shifted production away from China to lower-wage Cambodia to keep prices low," says Mr Yanai. And that means Fast Retailing could sell even cheaper products than Uniqlo. Confident of Uniqlo's successes, Mr Yanai has launched a competing and cheaper brand in 2006 called g.u. At g.u., a pair of jeans costs only 990 yen ($10) - a quarter of those at Uniqlo. He believes sales of what he claims are the cheapest jeans in the market are likely to be "explosive" and could easily top the planned annual target of 500,000 pairs. "I am not concerned that Uniqlo and g.u. would be directly competing," says Mr Yanai. "Uniqlo sells good quality products at reasonable prices, g.u. sells OK quality products at cheaper prices, so they are targeting different customers." As consumers around the world become more price and value conscious than ever, it could be a good time for Uniqlo to expand its business at home and overseas. Its challenges will begin when the economy starts to pick up.

EU reaches landmark expansion deal
It will be the biggest expansion in EU history The European Union has taken a major step towards expanding into central and eastern Europe - a move that will, barring last-minute problems, bring 10 new members by 2004.
Candidates shortlist Cyprus
Czech Republic
Estonia Hungary
Latvia
Lithuania
Malta
Poland
Slovakia
Slovenia Thirteen years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the European Commission has approved a report judging 10 countries ready for membership.
The report also supported Bulgaria and Romania's efforts to join in 2007, but no date has yet been set to start accession talks with Turkey.
In an interview with the BBC, Turkish Foreign Minister Sukru Sina Gurell warned that relations between Ankara and the EU would suffer if the report was ratified.
EU governments will take the final decisions on expanding the union at a summit in Brussels later this month, and then at a further summit in Copenhagen in December.
Jubilation
Guenter Verheugen, the EU commissioner leading the
expansion talks, said the approval of the 10 nations shortlisted reflected "the remarkable progress achieved by the
candidate countries".

But despite the stamp of approval, there are still major hurdles to overcome before enlargement goes ahead.
The Yes campaign is pulling out all the stops in Ireland Ireland must first vote in a referendum to adopt the Treaty of Nice - the treaty which outlines expansion - after rejecting it last time round.
The treaty must be ratified by all existing EU members to come into force.
And referenda on membership must be held in several applicant countries, many of whom are beginning to lose their enthusiasm for the European project.
Opponents of enlargement fear the arrival of the poor neighbours will drain money from the EU budget and slow down EU decision-making.
The expansion would add 75 million people to the 400 million already living in the EU, but the increase of population by nearly 20% adds no more than 5% to the union's wealth.
The 10 prospective new members, most of them former communist states, will be on probation for the next few years.
Three months before they join, the European Commission will report on how well they have kept their promises to adopt EU rules, and for two years after that, the union will be able to take action to prevent large flows of migrants from the east.
Turkey in the cold
Bulgaria and Romania, though not included in the first wave of expansion, have been told for the first time that 2007 could be envisaged as a possible date for them to join.
Both countries can expect EU support to be increased gradually from 2004.
I have high hopes for enlargement
John Adlington, UK Click here to send your comments
But despite pressure from the United States, the Commission proposed no date for
starting accession talks with Turkey. Ankara does not yet fulfil the political criteria on human rights, it said.
Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Gurell said that if the report's recommendations were approved, Turkey would be deeply dissappointed and would review its current agreements with the EU.
He also said the EU could seal the division of Cyprus - one of the countries which has been shortlisted - if the island was admitted into the union without a deal to reunify it. In the past, Turkey has threatened to annex the island's Turkish north if Cyprus joined the EU before a peace settlement. Greece, however, has said it will veto the entire enlargement process if Cyprus is kept out.

STARTER ACTIVITY
1. Video: Huw Edwards' tips
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Huw's top tip: Writing news
Video with subtitles
Students watch this Huw Edwards video, then recollect his top tips using this worksheet. Worksheet 3.1: Huw Edwards' top tips on writing news
Low tech alternative to videoUsing the above worksheet students match each top tip with Huw's advice. Teachers tip: This worksheet could also be used as a plenary activity. MAIN ACTIVITIES
2. Beginning, middle, endPrint a news story from the BBC News
or CBBC Newsround
websites using the Printable version function at the top of the page. Cut up the story into sections, two or three paragraphs in each section, or individual sentences if you wish to make the task more difficult. NEWS IS WRITTEN IN
Third person
Past tense
Example: Scientists have successfully produced... In small groups, students place the sections in order before comparing their sequence with the original story. Ask students: What did you notice about the beginning, middle and end of the reports? Where are most of the W facts? Where are most of the opinions? Explain: In many genres of writing, the main event occurs in the middle, or at the end, such as a murder-mystery novel. In news, the first sentence should reveal the key occurrence and often includes the key W facts. 3. Telling a storyIn pairs, students tell their partner about the last thing that interested them so much, they couldn't wait to tell someone else. That's what news is about - communicating something of interest. Alternatively, students can use the BBC News story they re-ordered at the beginning of the lesson, or a different story from the BBC News
or CBBC Newsround
websites, or a newspaper, and tell it to their partner in their own words. 4. Writing a scriptIndividually, students turn their spoken story into a script using this worksheet. Worksheet 3.2: Writing and Assembling News
Writing one word per cell will enable students to calculate how long it will take them to read aloud, based on the average speed of a professional journalist - three words a second. Before beginning writing, remind students of Huw's advice, to be: Clear - write how you would say it and get straight to the point at the beginning Concise - keep your sentences short Correct - get your facts right Students practice reading their scripts out loud, at three words a second. They will have another chance to do this in Lesson 6: Broadcasting news. Teachers tips: Limit students to a script of 30-seconds or less as it will help students remain concise. Students will probably need a few copies of the worksheet as one of Huw's tips is to write, re-write and re-write again. The worksheet is designed for scripting video or audio news, but can also be used for text-based news - and helps avoid the temptation to copy and paste. ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY
Students who complete their scripts can write a headline or a CUE (the bit the presenter says to introduce the story). Be careful that the cue doesn't just repeat the opening sentence of the script. 5. Checking a scriptAsk students: Why do you think there is a School Report rule that if you are taking part in the project, you must only use the first names of anyone under 18? Explain: The rule is to protect the identity of young people, as their work is broadcast on the internet, which can be accessed world-wide. More information on child protection
. In pairs, students check each other's work to make sure it contains only the first names of anyone under 18, and amend where necessary. PLENARY
6. Getting the point acrossA handful of students read their scripts to the rest of the group. After each reading, ask the group: What was the main point of the story? If the majority can answer, the script is a success - it has communicated news to the audience. For reference, teachers may like to look at previous years' resources including Lesson 3 for School Report 2006-8
. This lesson has been approved by the BBC College of Journalism.

'Miracle' 23-week baby goes home
Annabella James took her parents on an emotional rollercoaster
A family from East Sussex are celebrating being at home with their "miracle" baby who survived after being born at 23-and-a-half weeks' gestation.Jodi Andrews and her partner Mark James feared their daughter Annabella might not survive after she was born at Eastbourne's District General Hospital. But after four months' treatment in three hospitals in Surrey and Sussex she was discharged last week. "We can't believe how lucky we have been," said Mr James, from Willingdon. Ms Andrews was taken to the district general hospital by ambulance when she went into labour prematurely and gave birth the following morning. 'Fighting for breath'"She was born still in the amniotic sac, which is supposed to be lucky according to old wives' tales," said Mr James. "So from that point of view it was a miracle in itself, because she didn't have the distress she might have had or the bruising from the birth. "We were told they wouldn't normally resuscitate a baby under 24 weeks, but she was fighting for breath so luckily they did," said Mr James. From Eastbourne, Annabella was first transferred to the special care baby unit at St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey and then to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. "There were a lot of problems along the way," said Mr James. "We were told she had a one in four chance when we first arrived at St Peter's and it was a real emotional rollercoaster from then. "But she has really come through it and hasn't got any real problems. "The support we have had from the NHS has been absolutely fantastic." Please turn on JavaScript.

Annabella's mother, Jodi Andrews, says she "prepared herself for the worst" when she went into labour

Heavy rain brings flood warnings
Driving conditions have become hazardous in many areas
Heavy rain has been causing flooding chaos in Wales, and there were warnings that more severe weather was on the way.
Farmers in mid Wales are urged to ensure their animals were safe after the River Severn burst its banks and flooded acres of farmland.
Hundreds of acres of farmland along the banks of the Severn near Welshpool were flooded.
Some residents have had to be rescued
On Sunday, the Environment Agency announced that only one flood warning remained in place - for the River Severn near Welshpool, stretching from Pool Quay to Crew Green.
There are were seven flood watches - the lowest level of warning : Dyfi Valley and Machynlleth Lower Dee Valley from Llangollen to Chester The River Rheidol at Aberystwyth The River Teifi at Lampeter and Llanybyther
The River Teifi at Llandysul The River Teifi at Newcastle Emlyn, Cenarth and Llechryd
Upper Dee Valley down to Llangollen including Corwen
A teenage girl had to swim for her life after her car crashed during floods in north Wales on Friday.
Elin Sion, 17, of Eglwysbach, struggled from her vehicle after crashing into the overflowing River Conwy at Tan Lan bend on the A470 near Llanrwst on Friday.
She battled against strong currents in water which was up to her neck, and eventually struggled out.
Railway line
Paramedics treated her for shock at the scene before she was allowed to go home to recover from her ordeal. Her car remained in the water overnight and was winched out on Saturday.
Travel has been seriously hit by the weather. Flooding closed the main railway line from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth near Machynlleth in mid Wales, and buses had to be used to carry passengers around the obstruction until services resumed late on Saturday morning. The A487 was blocked at Tal-y-Llyn in Gwynedd after a landslide. Two people were rescued from a car after they were trapped in a flood near Machynlleth.
Sheep moved
Firefighters towed the vehicle out of the water on the A487 after a woman raised the alarm on her mobile phone. Earlier, 50 sheep were ferried to dry land after being caught by rising water at Llanbadarn on the outskirts of Aberystwyth. A weekend of heavy rain in many parts - with the worst of it across the hills of Wales - is being forecast. The Environment Agency has issued 31 flood warnings across the England and Wales.
Although many areas were expected to be dry on Saturday, the Met Office warned that several hours of rain was expected overnight and into Sunday. Forecasters expect the rain to ease on Sunday, as the wind picks up, with strong and possibly gale force winds in the north west.

Shadow over Plaid's 80th birthday
By Mark Hannaby
Political Reporter
Protest to politics: Plaid Cymru marks its 80th birthday
Plaid Cymru is 80 years old today, but as members celebrate at the National Eisteddfod they find the party at something of a crossroads.
The death of Gwynfor Evans in April deprived it of its most totemic figure.
It also had a disappointing general election, losing the Ceredigion seat and failing to make any gains.
Gwynfor Evans won its first parliamentary seat in Carmarthen in 1966, but until the 50s Plaid was more pressure group than political party.
'Tension'
Early leaders like Saunders Lewis pursued direct action campaigns against the erosion of Welsh language and culture. Lewis went to prison for setting fire to the RAF bombing school at Penyberth in 1936.
Former Plaid candidate and party expert Professor Laura McAllister said: "The party was formed by a small group of individuals who felt that there needed to be a much greater Welsh dimension to politics and a separate Welsh party.
The stark electoral facts are that Plaid Cymru is very, very unlikely to form a government in Cardiff Bay on its own
Professor Laura McAllister
"They talked about campaigning for Welsh freedom in those days so we didn't have any of the language of independence or self-government and they were very much tied in with an idea of a Welsh civilisation and the Welsh language. "They were campaigning electorally and trying to put up candidates for some elections with very little success in the early days but they were also trying to fight direct action campaigns on specific issues.
"And therein lies the history of Plaid Cymru, really: this tension between being a political party and being a campaigning or pressure group."
First MP: Gwynfor Evans died in April aged 92
But Prof McAllister said today's Plaid had failed to adjust well to devolution and argued that it had to think seriously about coalition with other parties.
"The stark electoral facts are that Plaid Cymru is very, very unlikely to form a government in Cardiff Bay on its own," she said.
"I don't see there's any way the party can avoid this issue because if it's really serious about shedding its pressure group past and moving to becoming a serious political party and a party of government it has to think about its relationship with the other parties."
Plaid reached a pinnacle in 1999, when in the first Welsh assembly elections it won traditional Labour strongholds like Islwyn, Rhondda and Llanelli, as well as Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly councils. Plaid Cymru has not presented a modern corporate image: the party as a whole does not resonate with the people of Wales
Former councillor Syd Morgan
But in 2003 Plaid lost those assembly seats and the following year both the valley councils. In this year's general election not only did it lose Ceredigion, but failed to regain its main target seat of Ynys Mon.
What happened? Critics might argue the party is still too much in thrall to particular campaigns - the fate of the Welsh language, the vexed question of "independence," or the need for affordable rural housing, for example.
But that was denied by South Wales West AM Helen Mary Jones. "I think that's absolutely not the case," she said. "Plaid Cymru speaks to and for all the people of Wales.
"Affordable housing isn't an issue for rural communities any more. It's an issue for all of us, and it's an issue the British political parties are singularly failing to address."
She did, however, concede that the party needed to rebuild its electoral organisation from the ground up.
'Less organised'
Former Rhondda Cynon Taf Plaid councillor Syd Morgan described it as "the only party in Wales that hasn't adjusted to devolution.
"Labour, Conservatives and Lib Dems have all rebranded themselves as Welsh parties with distinctive Welsh policies," said Mr Morgan. "Plaid Cymru has not presented a modern corporate image: the party as a whole does not resonate with the people of Wales. "Plaid Cymru nowadays tends to be less organised than things were and the party needs to get itself into gear at all kinds of levels.
"I don't think there's much wrong with Plaid Cymru's message, but (the party has) difficulty in getting that message over."

Caso Stanford salpica a A. Latina y el Caribe
Redacci�n BBC Mundo Decenas de ahorristas hicieron fila frente a las oficinas del banco en Antigua para retirar sus dep�sitos.
La investigaci�n por fraude que pesa sobre el empresario estadounidense Robert Allen Stanford, presidente y accionista principal del grupo de empresas Stanford, ha generado gran preocupaci�n en Am�rica Latina y el Caribe, donde varias ramificaciones de sus negocios han tenido que cerrar mientras se esclarecen las acusaciones. Adem�s, cientos de personas han acudido a distintos bancos de la regi�n asociados con el multimillonario para intentar retirar su dinero, por temor a que los activos sean congelados de manera indefinida, algo que ha comenzado a suceder en algunos pa�ses.
La Comisi�n de Valores y Bolsas de Estados Unidos (SEC, por sus siglas en ingl�s) present� cargos contra el empresario por un presunto fraude de aproximadamente US$8.000 millones, en lo que representa el segundo esc�ndalo de esta naturaleza que azota al sistema financiero de Estados Unidos en los �ltimos meses, tras el caso de Bernard Madoff.
Las autoridades financieras estadounidenses dicen que desconocen el paradero de Stanford, quien no ha sido visto desde el martes, cuando la SEC present� su denuncia.
La SEC dijo que s�lo el financista y un asociado cercano saben d�nde est� la mayor parte del dinero.
De 58 a�os de edad, Stanford tiene doble ciudadan�a (de Antigua y Estados Unidos), y es visto como una figura exuberante, con v�nculos con pol�ticos y estrellas del deporte. Es el principal inversionista privado de las islas caribe�as de Antigua y Bermuda.
Lea: �Explota la burbuja del fraude financiero?
En Antigua La SEC acusa a Stanford de haber vendido certificados de dep�sito -prometiendo elevados beneficios, de hasta 8% de inter�s- que no estaban garantizados por la Corporaci�n Federal de Seguro de Dep�sitos de EE.UU.
Robert Allen Stanford fue acusado de fraude por la SEC.
Entre las compa��as acusadas de fraude figuran Stanford International Bank, con sede en la isla caribe�a de Antigua, Stanford Group Co, basado en Houston, EE.UU., y la consultora Stanford Capital Management.
En Antigua, se cree que Stanford recaud� miles de millones de d�lares a trav�s de su filial internacional, prometiendo que el dinero se invertir�a en instrumentos financieros confiables, pero la SEC asegura que el dinero se destin� a otro tipo de inversiones y, por lo tanto, consigui� una orden judicial para congelar los activos de los acusados, entre quienes se encuentran dos altos directivos financieros del grupo. "Como sostuvimos en nuestra demanda, Stanford y el cerrado c�rculo de familiares y amigos con quienes dirige sus negocios perpetraron un enorme fraude basado en falsas promesas", se�al� la directora de vigilancia y control de la SEC, Linda Thomsen, en un comunicado. El efecto en Am�rica Latina
El grupo Standford tiene, adem�s, varios negocios en Am�rica Latina. Loa activos de varias filiales del grupo Stanford fueron congelados.
El superintendente de bancos de Venezuela, Edgar Hern�ndez Behrens, dijo que se especula que inversionistas de ese pa�s tienen fondos por unos US$2.500 millones en el Stanford Bank de Antigua. Sin embargo, a�adi� que la sucursal venezolana del Stanford Bank es independiente de las sedes de esa instituci�n en Estados Unidos y el Caribe, por lo que no cree que haya repercusiones entre los clientes en el pa�s suramericano.
El corresponsal de la BBC en Caracas, Will Grant, se�al� que la situaci�n en Antigua es potencialmente mucho m�s grave que en Venezuela, debido a que Robert Allen Stanford ten�a all� el mayor n�mero de inversiones.
En la capital de M�xico, decenas de inversionistas reclamaron sus ahorros frente a las oficinas de Stanford Financial, que no abri� sus puertas este mi�rcoles.
En Panam�, la autoridad reguladora de bancos anunci� que tomaba el control de la filial de Stanford Financial Group. Sudam�rica
La unidad en Colombia suspendi� sus operaciones en el mercado local, con la autorizaci�n de la Superintendencia Financiera.
PRESENCIA EN A. LATINA

"No es una intervenci�n, es una inactivaci�n proferida y patrocinada por la administraci�n de la compa��a, que la Superintendencia (Financiera) acept� en la medida en que la firma no tiene problemas de caja y hemos sido completamente transparentes a la hora de mostrar lo que tenemos ac�", le dijo el gerente de la firma de Stanford Financial Group en Colombia, �lvaro Camaro, a la agencia de noticias Reuters.
Seg�n el comunicado de prensa de la Superintendencia Financiera, Stanford S.A. s�lo podr� utilizar los recursos en su poder para cumplir operaciones y compromisos pendientes en el mercado de valores.
En Ecuador, una subsidiaria local de Stanford deber� suspender sus operaciones por 30 d�as en la bolsa de Quito.
Y en Per�, los reguladores enviaron a un equipo de inspecci�n a la oficina local de Stanford.
En Miami, EE.UU., se supo que este mi�rcoles fueron allanadas por autoridades federales las oficinas de Stanford Group, un d�a despu�s de que cerca de 40 funcionarios hicieran lo mismo en la sede principal del banco en Houston, Texas.

Fond farewell to Butterley Engineering works
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
The site of the former Butterley Engineering works near Ripley, Derbyshire, has finally succumbed to the demolition men. BBC East Midlands Today's James Roberson reminds us how the company was a major iron works provider for more than two centuries and had a hand in the construction of many iconic buildings, including St Pancras Station, Vauxhall Bridge, Portsmouth's Spinnaker Tower, the Falkirk Wheel and many more.

McGrath backs choice to bat again
Ponting's decision gave McGrath a well-earned rest
Glenn McGrath backed skipper Ricky Ponting's decision not to enforce the follow-on as Australia turned the screw against England in Brisbane.
They already had a 445-run lead when they began their second innings and extended it to 626 by the close.
"Time was in our favour with two and a half days still to go," said McGrath.
"All the bowlers were ready to go if required, but we thought we'd let the sun get on the wicket a bit more and let the cracks open up a bit more."
The 36-year-old marked his first Test appearance for 11 months with figures of 6-50, the 29th time he has taken five or more wickets in an innings.
606: DEBATE
We're doomed, we'll be lucky if we win anything with the form the Aussies are in
FE
606: Have your say
He insisted, however, there was still room for improvement.
"I need to go through the crease a bit better but you can't really complain when you walk off with six-for," McGrath said.
"I just tried to be patient and hit good areas. I knew the cracks were there or thereabouts - talking to Ricky Ponting, he said it was hard work batting when you got it in that area and really built pressure up.
"You always try to bowl that perfect game. That's what I'm always aiming for. I don't think I'll ever get there but as long as I keep trying hopefully I'll keep improving."
