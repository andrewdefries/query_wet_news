Rwandan government statement
The Tutsi-led government in Rwanda has issued a statement calling on Hutu civilians to dissociate themselves from Hutu rebels suspected of a massacre in the northwest of the country earlier this month in which more than three hundred Tutsis were killed.
The statement was issued by the prime minister's office and broadcast on national radio.
It said the massacres in the communes of Ruhengeri and Gisenyi were a continuation of the 1994 genocide, during which hundreds-of-thousands of ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu extremists.
The statement placed the responsibility of the attack on Hutu rebel leaders living abroad, and called on the international community to arrest them.

Megawati puts pressure on Wahid
Indonesia's army refused to back a state of emergency
Indonesian Vice-President Megawati Sukarnoputri has warned against the break-up of the country - a move seen as putting increasing pressure on President Abdurrahman Wahid to resign.
In a speech to military officers, Ms Megawati said Indonesia risked becoming the sick man of Asia if it failed to make the transition to democracy. Megawati did not mention Wahid by name
It needed a leader who would solve its problems rather than accumulate power, she said. Correspondents have described the speech as a veiled attack on President Wahid, who is facing possible impeachment over corruption allegations. As vice-president, Ms Megawati would automatically succeed Mr Wahid if he were to be impeached.
Army chiefs made it clear on Sunday that they would not support the president if he decided to impose a state of emergency in an effort to avoid impeachment.
"If he insists on this, we will no longer help him,"Army chief General Endriartono Sutarto told Tempo magazine.
'Avoid tragedy'
Ms Megawati said Indonesia had to move on from being an authoritarian state and avoid the fate of other countries which had disintegrated into chaos in recent years.
Wahid - 'desperate' to hold on to power
"We must learn so that that kind of tragedy does not occur in our beloved land," she said.
Without mentioning Mr Wahid by name, she said that a leader's legitimacy depended on people's acceptance of him and his success in implementing his mandate, rather than his personal power.
Ms Megawati and Mr Wahid both failed to attend a emergency cabinet meeting on Sunday called to discuss the crisis.
It is believed the meeting was originally called so that Mr Wahid could present plans for a state of emergency.
Desperation
With no signs that he has been able to make a deal with parliament over impeachment moves, correspondents say that Mr Wahid is becoming increasing desperate to cling on to power.
But in the past few days commanders of the armed forces have made it clear they will not support a crackdown.
Mr Wahid's attempt to replace top commanders with others who are more compliant also appeared to have been thwarted after Ms Megawati met army chiefs on Saturday.

Actress Richards to divorce Sheen
Richards and Sheen met on a film set in 2000
Actress Denise Richards has filed for divorce from actor Charlie Sheen, after less than three years of marriage.
The 34-year-old, who is six months pregnant with her second child, cited "irreconcilable differences" as the reason for the split.
She is seeking custody of their daughter Sam, who was born in 2004, as well as their unborn child.
Richards met Sheen on the set of the film Good Advice. The pair also worked together on the TV sitcom Spin City.
According to court documents filed in Los Angeles, Richards also requested that Sheen support her, and that he be granted visitation rights to their children.
Probation
Sheen, 39, the son of actor Martin Sheen, is best known for his roles in the 80s movies Platoon and Wall Street, as well as taking over from Michael J Fox in Spin City.
He won a Golden Globe award for his role as Deputy Mayor Charlie Crawford in 2002.
The actor has a history of wild behaviour, and had been on probation for two years for alcohol and drug abuse until 1999.
Sheen was previously married for five months in 1996 to model Donna Peele, and has a 20-year-old daughter, Cassandra, by high school sweetheart Paula Profitt.
Richards' career has included roles in Starship Troopers and Wild Things, as well as playing Bond girl Dr Christmas Jones in 1999's The World Is Not Enough.
Shortly before marrying Sheen, she told a newspaper, "I've never been happier. I've met my perfect man, and this marriage is going to last."

DNA computers take shape
Anchoring DNA to a substrate may liberate its computing pottential
By BBC News Online Science Editor Dr David Whitehouse
Scientists have made a small but vital step forward in the quest to harness the vast computing potential of DNA.
We can see scaling up within a few years by a factor of a trillion or more
Lloyd Smith
The US team show that DNA computing can be simplified by attaching the molecules to a surface and then using them to tackle real and complex problems.
DNA computing is still very much a dream for scientists. They hope to harness the enormous data-storing capacity of DNA, biological molecules that are also able to perform operations similar to a computer's. DNA can do this through the manufacture of enzymes, which are biological catalysts that could be called the 'software' used to execute the desired calculation. Simpler and more accessible
The new research, published in the journal Nature, reports the development of novel surface chemistry that greatly simplifies the complex and repetitive steps previously used in rudimentary DNA computers. It takes DNA out of the test tube and puts it on a solid surface, making the technology simpler, more accessible and more amenable to the development of larger DNA computers. "It demonstrates DNA computing on surfaces, which provides a relatively simple pathway to upscaling DNA computing to solve large problems," says team leader Lloyd Smith of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In the experiments, DNA molecules were applied to a small glass plate overlaid with gold. The DNA was modified so that all the possible answers to a computationally difficult problem were included. By exposing the molecules to certain enzymes, the molecules with the wrong answers were weeded out, leaving only the DNA molecules with the right answers. Mega-memory
The appeal of DNA computing lies in the fact that DNA molecules can store far more information than any existing computer memory chip. It has been estimated that a gram of dried DNA can hold as much information as a trillion CDs. What is more, in a biochemical reaction taking place in a tiny surface area, hundreds of trillions of DNA molecules can operate in concert, creating a parallel processing system that resembles the processing architecture of the most powerful supercomputer. The logic behind conventional digital computers represents information as a series of electrical impulses using ones and zeros. DNA computing depends on information represented as a pattern of molecules arranged on a strand of DNA. Question of scale
Conventional computing, with ever more and smaller features packed onto the silicon chips that power it, is approaching the limits of miniaturisation. Many believe that DNA computing is a way around that barrier. Current DNA computing technology, Professor Smith emphasises, is still far from overtaking the silicon chip. He says his new method is simply a testbed for working out an improved and simpler chemistry for DNA computing. Nevertheless, he adds, the new surface chemistry provides an opportunity for harnessing DNA to make the biggest non-conventional computer yet: "We're interested in scale up. We believe that based on the principles we've worked out here, we can see scaling up within a few years by a factor of a trillion or more." Search BBC News Online

Heads' concern over 3Rs drive
Teachers will be able to download lesson plans
By Katherine Sellgren at the SHA conference in Newport
Plans to extend the literacy and numeracy drive from primary schools into secondaries have been described as "prescriptive" by the Secondary Heads Association (SHA).
The government wants to see a minimum of three hours spent on English and maths each week by 11 to 14 year olds.
This will destroy a lot of the creativity that brings teachers into the profession
John Dunford, SHA New teaching materials and a new framework will be introduced, as well as catch-up classes and summer schools in literacy and numeracy.
Speaking to delegates at SHA's annual conference in Newport, Gwent, the Education Secretary, David Blunkett, said the scheme would enable pupils to make better progress in their first years at secondary school.
"Teaching in those early secondary years will be subject to greater rigour with a focus next year on English and maths," Mr Blunkett said.
"The new frameworks for teaching build on the successful primary literacy and numeracy strategies."
Pilot schemes carried out in 200 schools had proved successful and paved the way for the scheme to be introduced from September, Mr Blunkett said.
And teachers would be given an extra day's training to find out more about the strategy, he added.
'Legal?'
But general secretary of SHA, John Dunford, said: "To translate a prescriptive literacy and numeracy strategy from primary schools is a disastrous way of introducing that Key Stage strategy."
Mr Dunford even questioned the government's right to introduce such a strict stipulation.
"I don't think the government is allowed, under the Education Act 1996, to tell schools how much time to spend on this or that subject.
"This will destroy a lot of the creativity that brings teachers into the profession," he warned.
A government source stressed that schools were not being told what to do - the idea of three hours a week of whole-class teaching was a "recommendation" and was what a lot of schools were doing already.

Unruly behaviour move defended
Electronic tagging will be extended to under-16s
The new legislation on anti-social behaviour will be "a defining moment" for the Scottish Parliament, according to the communities minister.
Speaking at Scottish Labour's annual conference in Inverness, Margaret Curran defended the move.
The Anti-Social Behaviour Bill aims to force parents to take responsibility for their offspring and extend electronic tagging to under-16s.
It would also give police new powers to disperse groups.
Ms Curran rejected criticism of the legislation and told the conference some local communities refused the offer of play parks or open spaces because these would become the focus of disorder.
She said: "We have to confront the reality of millions of pounds of wasted investment into houses and streets where no-one wants to live because of a local
environment blighted by anti-social behaviour.
If the middle class journalists sitting in the wine-bars find this boring, too bad
Margaret CurranCommunities minister
"This type of behaviour cannot go unchallenged. All other parties have - but we will not hide from the realities.
"Labour is determined to ensure the focus of our parliament is on the real experiences of real people.
"If the middle class journalists sitting in the wine-bars find this boring, too bad."
Activist Helena Brackenridge told the conference that young people themselves were the victims of anti-social behaviour.
"We are sending a clear signal that those who disrespect their communities, young or old, will no longer have the upper hand," she said.
Johann Lamont, MSP for Glasgow Pollok, told delegates that anti-social behaviour undermined efforts to improve other services like transport.
She said: "You will never secure social inclusion if you have families frightened in their homes, embarrassed to bring friends back, and whose only desire is to get
out of the communities they have created - and when they seek help, the great and the good sneer."

Ask the class:

Discussion: Ban cigarette adverts?
Cigarette advertising is already banned on television, and cigarette adverts must carry a health warning. But should cigarette adverts be banned completely? What would be a reason for banning cigarette adverts?
What would be a reason for allowing cigarette advertising on television?
How do adverts affect you and the things that you buy?
Use these comments to start a discussion:
[A] "Banning advertising is purely a symbol to show something is being done - it is not even a step in the right direction. I think that peer pressure plays far more of a role than advertising does, and if we are to become a country that peers down our noses at smokers then we should ban advertising of anything that is unhealthy/unsafe, including fast food and driving."
Carlos
[B] "I don't think people should ban cigarettes adverts as they bring much needed funding to the country."
Goby
[C] "I think that cigarette adverts should be banned because it makes people smoke and the population might decrease because of cancer."
Sara
[D] "Cigarette adverts should be strictly banned! The cigarette advertisements are an extremely bad influence to young kids! I think cigarette advertisements are stupid. The cigarette companies don't know the harm that their ads do to kids minds."

Plenary
Recap on the main teaching points and discuss which new things they have learned and things they may need to find out more about.
Teachers' Background
The law:
It is against the law to sell cigarettes to anyone under the age of 16 (but over 70% of young smokers report having no difficulty in buying cigarettes from local shops).
It is not against the law for under-16-year-olds to buy, possess or smoke cigarettes.
The advertising of tobacco products on television is banned (but many sports events such as Formula One motor racing and snooker clearly display cigarette brands).
Tobacco products must carry the general warning "Tobacco seriously damages health", and cigarette packets must carry a second warning on the back of the pack selected from a list of 15, such as "Smoking when pregnant harms your baby" and "Protect children: don't make them breathe your smoke".
The facts:
In Great Britain about 450 children start smoking every day.
Under-16-year-olds now spend about �135 million every year on cigarettes.
Some children as young as five are regular smokers.
In England in 1996, about 33% of girls and 28% of boys aged 15 were regular smokers.
About 17 million cigarettes are consumed every week in England by under-16-year-olds.
About 29% of adult smokers start regular smoking as 14 to 15-year-olds. For all links and resources click at top right.

Renault blames Briatore & Symonds
Briatore lifts the constructors trophy at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix
Renault director general Patrick Pelata has laid the blame for the Formula 1 race-fixing scandal firmly at the feet of Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds.Briatore and Symonds resigned after Renault chose not to contest charges of fixing the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. "Flavio Briatore considered he was morally responsible and resigned," Pelata told French radio station RTL. "We don't want a fault by two people to reflect upon the whole company and the entire Formula 1 team." Renault will appear before governing body, the FIA, in Paris on Monday charged with ordering former driver Nelson Piquet Jr to deliberately crash in Singapore last year to help team-mate Fernando Alonso win the race. "I don't know all the details but there was a fault and a fault requires a sanction," said Pelata. "We will know more about the details after what will happen on Monday with the FIA. For the moment we have assumptions but it is clear that basically there was a fault."
ANDREW BENSON'S BLOG
The allegation has rocked F1 to the core, the latest damaging episode for a sport that has recently suffered a number of cases that have brought its integrity into question
Piquet crashed two laps after Alonso had come in for a routine pit-stop, meaning that when race officials sent out the safety car to clear up the debris from Piquet's car, Alonso was alone among the front-runners in not having to stop for fuel and tyres. Renault's double world champion went on to take the chequered flag at Formula 1's inaugural night race and clinch the team's first victory in two years. At the time, Piquet attributed the crash to a simple error, but after being dropped by the team after July's Hungary GP the race-fixing allegations emerged. The Brazilian has since testified to the FIA that he was instructed by team principal Briatore and executive director of engineering Symonds when and where to crash. Renault's response was to accuse the 24-year-old and his father Nelson Piquet of false allegations and blackmail, going as far as saying they would begin legal action against them. But on Wednesday the team said in a statement they would "not dispute the recent allegations made by the FIA concerning the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix", while team boss Briatore and executive director of engineering Symonds departed their posts.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Monday's hearing will attempt to attribute responsibility for the affair and the FIA could still impose sanctions if Renault are found guilty. Potential punishments include excluding the team from the championship, although that must be considered unlikely given the two people Piquet said were responsible have now left the team. Pelata would not be drawn on the French manufacturer's continuing involvement in the sport and the possibility that they could walk away. "This is not the debate today. We will have it calmly," he added. "Formula 1 is the world's most-watched show and you have to respect that. Formula One has been in the vanguard of progress for car technology. "It is probably not the case at the moment, but it could be again and it is always what Renault have tried to do."
Symonds was Renault's director of engineering
Meanwhile, ex-Formula 1 driver Eddie Irvine feels there has been an overreaction to the charges being levelled at Renault. "Formula 1 has always been a war and in war all is fair," the former Jordan and Ferrari driver told BBC Radio 5 live. "When I was in various teams you would do anything to win. Back in the day it was normal. "This is probably slightly on the wrong side of the cheating thing but in days past every team have done whatever they could to win - cheat, bend the rules, break the rules, sabotage opponents. This is just the FIA going on a crusade." The Northern Irishman also believes that if Renault are found guilty, the FIA will deal with them leniently. "Formula One cannot afford to lose more teams. For me, it will be a massaged court where the fine will be reduced in order not to scare Renault away. "There are several teams in the sport that are looking shaky and they cannot afford to kick Renault out of Formula 1."
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The 1996 world champion Damon Hill added that the case is not a good episode for the sport. "There have clearly been some issues in the sport recently and there is a lot of soul-searching to be done," he said. "It is a huge sport with a huge amount of interest and sometimes controversies add to the interest but you want it to be for the right reasons. "I'm concerned that the sport is going to suffer as a genuine challenge of skill and competitiveness."
