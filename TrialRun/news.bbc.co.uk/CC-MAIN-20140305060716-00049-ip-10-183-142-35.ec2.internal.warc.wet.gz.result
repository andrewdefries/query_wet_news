Carey ordained 'gay bishops'
Dr Carey upheld a traditionalist line on homosexuality
The former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr George Carey has said he ordained two bishops in the 1990s he suspected might have been gay, a newspaper has reported.
The report, in the Sunday Times, marks the first intervention in the row within the Anglican Church over the appointment of the gay priest Canon Jeffrey John as Bishop of Reading.
However, the paper reported Dr Carey as saying he had "never knowingly ordained a practising homosexual".
Dr Carey said he believed the two bishops he ordained when they assured him there were "no skeletons in their cupboards", the paper reported.
I have always said that there are only two lifestyles: celibacy and
monogamy
Dr George Carey
"They may have been homosexual. My suspicion of both men was that they were probably homosexual by inclination but neither said they had been in a relationship in the past.
"There was no evidence whatsoever that they had been in a relationship.
"If they had been, that wasn't disclosed. I was assured by them that there
was nothing to embarrass the church."
Without naming the two bishops, Dr Carey was quoted by the paper as saying: "I want to protect these two people. They're honourable
people. To this day, I don't doubt their veracity and lifestyle."
He said he would stop an ordination if he learned the person was in a homosexual relationship.
'Distressed'
Dr John, who is due to be ordained as Bishop of Reading on 9 October, has been in a relationship with a man for 27 years but says he is now celibate. Of the controversial appointment of Dr John, Dr Carey said: "I'm very distressed by the situation. I would have followed the rule book.
"Jeffrey John is a good man. He's a fine thinker, but I would not have
allowed his name to go forward."
Dr John says he is now celibate
Dr Carey said he would also have asked married people whether they had any
potentially damaging secrets, such as affairs, before ordaining them as
bishops.
As leader of the Church Dr Carey upheld the traditionalist line that active homosexuality was wrong for priests and lay people alike.
"I am a traditionalist and I believe that sex should be restricted to monogamous heterosexual marriages," he said on Sunday.
"I have always said that there are only two lifestyles: celibacy and monogamy."
His comments are likely to be used by Dr John's supporters as evidence of the Church promoting gay priests prepared to keep quiet about their sexuality but turning against one who has been more candid, according to BBC religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott.
The row over the bishop's appointment looks likely to dominate this week's meeting of the General Synod, the church's parliament.
Traditionalists say their criticism of Dr John focuses on his unwillingness to repent of his once open sexuality and his fierce criticism of the Church's teaching on the issue, said Robert Pigott.
The current Archbishop Dr Rowan Williams has already said he raised no objection to Dr John's appointment. E-mail this to a friend

Cornish language extinct, says UN
The next edition of the atlas could feature revitalised languages
The Cornish language has been branded "extinct" by linguistic experts, sparking protests from speakers.Thirty linguists worked on Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, compiled by United Nations group Unesco. They also said Manx Gaelic was extinct. Cornish is believed to have died out as a first language in 1777. But the Cornish Language Partnership says the number of speakers has risen in the past 20 years and there should be a section for revitalised languages. The Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, published by Unesco, the cultural section of the United Nations, features about 2,500 dialects. There are thought to be about 300 fluent speakers of Cornish.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. But Jenefer Lowe, development manager of the Cornish Language Partnership, said there were thousands who had a "smattering" of the language. "Saying Cornish is extinct implies there are no speakers and the language is dead, which it isn't," she said. "Unesco's study doesn't take into account languages which have growing numbers of speakers and in the past 20 years the revival of Cornish has really gathered momentum." Last year the partnership agreed a single written form of Cornish which brought together several different forms of the language. It is among a group of languages that turned out not to be extinct but merely sleeping
Christopher Moseley Editor-in-chief of the atlas
UN declares Manx Gaelic 'extinct'
Mrs Lowe said: "There's no category for a language that is revitalised and revived. "What they need to do is add a category. "It should be recognised that languages do revive and it's a fluid state." Christopher Moseley, an Australian linguist and editor-in-chief of the atlas, told BBC News he would consider a new classification. He said: "I have always been optimistic about Cornish and Manx. "There is a groundswell of interest in them, although the number of speakers is small. "Perhaps in the next edition we shall have a 'being revived' category. "[Cornish] is among a group of languages that turned out not to be extinct but merely sleeping." Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

Petitioners oppose eco-town plan
Opponents have claimed the town will overwhelm the area
Hundreds of people have signed a petition against plans to build 20,000 homes in Leicestershire.
Campaigners said the planned eco-town south of Leicester near Great Glen would ruin the mostly rural area. The idea is part of a government programme to create 10 carbon neutral settlements across the country.
The petition, on the 10 Downing Street website, has seen a surge of support as the date for a decision gets closer, campaigners have said.
One of the campaigners, Councillor Kevin Feltham, said they would be holding a public meeting next month.
Public consultation
He said: "It's important really that members of the public who perhaps haven't been as up to date as some people... need to be brought up to date with what we know as of now and what there is they can do about it. "They need to know how they can contact the relevant ministers, obviously write to their MPs and write to the Co-op themselves."
The Co-op, which owns much of the land concerned, said the plans would be submitted to the government and, if short-listed, there would be a full public consultation.
More than 50 proposals have been sent to the government and a decision is expected in February.

Second theatre drops play plans
Three police officers were hurt in struggles at the theatre
The boss of a Birmingham theatre company which was considering staging a play cancelled after violent demonstrations has dropped his plans.
Neal Foster, of the Birmingham Stage Company, criticised the decision to cancel the play - Behzti - saying it had been made by "cowards".
But now he says he is pulling out of plans to stage it following a request by the author, Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti.
He said that Ms Bhatti feared for her safety after receiving threats.
'Increased threats'
Birmingham Repertory Theatre dropped Behzti, which depicts murder and sex abuse in a temple, on safety grounds after hundreds of Sikh protesters clashed with police outside the theatre on Saturday night.
Three police officers were hurt in the demonstrations and 800 theatre-goers, including children, had to be evacuated.
Mr Foster, whose theatre company is based at the city's Old Rep theatre, said earlier this week he would consider staging the production if it was not reinstated.
Sikh leaders wanted the play set in a community centre
But on Wednesday he said he had received a call from the play's author requesting him not to continue with his plans because of the "increased threats" to her safety.
"The plan I came up with was to invite theatres across the country to read the play and discuss it afterwards, to have a debate so there was more understanding about the whole issue," he said.
"I was proceeding with these plans until last night, when I received a request from the author."
Mr Foster added that he had also received several threatening phone calls.
Ms Bhatti is reportedly in hiding after receiving death
threats because of the play's subject matter, which Sikhs claim demeans their religion.
The Royal Court theatre in London says it may now stage the play.

Tribunal fee plan under fire
The tribunal system is under severe strain
The government has come under immediate fire after announcing plans to charge workers for taking cases to employment tribunals.
Ministers say the fee will be a "modest amount", designed to speed up the system and fund improvements, but reports have suggested it could be as high as �100.
The government will effectively be penalising workers who have already been penalised by bad bosses
John Edmonds GMB union head
Unions and an influential employment campaign group, the Industrial Society, have attacked the proposal, warning it will "ration justice" and discriminate against the less well-off.
Backbench Labour MPs, already angry at government plans to introduce greater private sector involvement in the public services, are expected to join the criticism.
The fee is part of a wide-ranging package of measures, published in a consultation document on Friday, designed to reduce the "strain" on the tribunal system.
Tribunal explosion
The number of employment tribunal applications in England and Wales reached 130,000 last year, with three out of four settled out of court.
Employers have backed the government's review, saying it will give all sides more opportunities to resolve disagreements before the tribunal machinery is set in motion. Some want even higher fees to deter employees further.
New proposals include:
Complainant fees
In-house dispute resolution procedures
Increasing awards where procedures not in place
Fast-track system for some cases
Fixed period of conciliation
But John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB union, was adamant that charging workers to bring a case was not the solution.
"Access to industrial justice should be based on need rather than ability to pay," he said.
"For many workers, a charge of possibly hundreds of pounds simply to exercise their rights will be simply too prohibitive."
Patrick Burns, of the Industrial Society, said a better way of "curbing the tribunal explosion" would be to increase funding for the conciliation service Acas.
"Charging tribunal applicants is not the way forward. It will discriminate against low earners and ration justice to the better off," he added. Charge exemptions
But Employment Relations Minister Alan Johnson emphasised that exemptions to the charge would apply to people on benefits and in cases of genuine need.
"Charging a modest amount would bring a faster and more customer-focused service and also raise funding for improvements in the tribunal and conciliation process," he said.
"At least a quarter of all tribunal applications which come from those who are on benefits or in genuine need will be exempt from any charges. Alan Johnson: Tribunals are expensive for businesses
"These people will still have access to justice."
However, he went on to stress the "considerable" costs to business of defending tribunal claims, often exceeding �5,000 plus associated management costs as well as the damage to workplace relations.
The government is convinced that many disagreements can be resolved through better procedures in the workplace.
The new proposals included making organisations introduce in-house dispute resolution procedures, and increasing tribunal awards where procedures are not
used by an employer.
The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the review of the current tribunal system, which it described as "ridiculous and costly".
Director General David Lennan said: "We will be consulting employers over the next couple of months to work on the detailed proposals, but feel that the government is moving in the right direction." Search BBC News Online

Ancient mummies found in school
Updated 24 February 2004, 19.57
Builders working at a school in Peru have stumbled on two of the oldest mummies ever discovered there.
The workers were digging a new sports field in Islay province when they made the find on 12 February.
Archaeologists say the pair, aged five and about 35 when they died, were buried at least 700 years ago, and are unusually well preserved.
Experts think the pair were part of the Chiribaya culture which existed in Peru between the years 800 and 1350.
How do you make a mummy?
They also think that the man was a farmer because he was found with bags of seed attached to his belt and a spade by his side.
The ancient duo was displayed at the National Institute of Culture on Monday.
They will now be cleaned and studied by the archaeologists.

BBC News | Special Reports | China's Communist Revolution
On 1 October 1949 Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China. It was a time of revolution, upheaval and bloodshed. The events of that period, and the first decades of communist rule which followed, forged the identity of modern China. Use the key on the left to learn the facts behind the myths of China's revolutionary history, and to hear eyewitness reports from people who lived through the period - from the BBC World Service's My Century programme.

Olympiakos 0-0 Chelsea
By Paresh Soni
Drogba (centre) failed to make an impression on his return from Africa
Chelsea were held by Olympiakos after an unconvincing display in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on a cold night in southern Greece.
John Terry and Frank Lampard were left on the bench but the Blues were largely untroubled in a quiet first half in which Ricardo Carvalho went closest.
The visitors showed more ambition after the break but failed to create much.
Salomon Kalou shot tamely at the keeper when through late on and Chelsea will hope for much better in a fortnight.
Interview: Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole
Frank Lampard's tips and tricks
With their formidable home record, they will be favourites to reach the semi-finals for the fourth time in five seasons.
But even though the competition's meanest defence recorded a fifth straight clean sheet, the fare served up in unseasonably harsh weather for Greece hardly set the pulses racing.
Olympiakos have plenty of experience and nous about them, with an average age of a shade over 30 in their starting line-up and 10 league titles in 11 years. 606: DEBATE
We lacked creativity and ambition but we can still look ahead to the next leg
Esssienisanengine
Chelsea were happy to concede possession to them and while Predrag Djordjevic and Luciano Galleti buzzed around early on to keep England left-back Ashley Cole busy, the final ball was often lacking.
At the other end, the Blues appeared to have the edge in terms of pace and movement off the ball.
Florent Malouda's snapshot was well saved by 36-year-old keeper Antonis Nikopolidis, who also kept out Carvalho's firm header after Juliano Belletti's deep free-kick was flicked on by Malouda. The visitors had a scare moments later when Djordjevic's corner was helped on by Ieroklis Stoltidis' head but Vassilis Torosidis failed to make clean contact.
Having seen what Olympiakos had to throw at them in the first period, the Blues showed greater desire to commit men forward after the break, with Ashley and Joe Cole featuring more prominently than they had earlier. But with Didier Drogba appearing to struggle with a tight hamstring on his comeback after African Nations duty, they lacked a cutting edge.
Indeed, Chelsea needed keeper Petr Cech to save low down in his first meaningful action in the 57th minute when Galletti teed the ball to Djordjevic from a free-kick.
Kalou, Nicolas Anelka and, belatedly, Lampard were introduced by Avram Grant in a bid to find some sharpness in the final third but they failed to make much of an impression on the home defence.
