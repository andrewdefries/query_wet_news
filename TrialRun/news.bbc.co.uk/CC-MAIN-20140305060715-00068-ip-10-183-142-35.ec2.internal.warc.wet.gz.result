Porto Alegre's need for concrete action
Environmental issues were at the top of the agenda
By Ruchi Tripathi Policy advisor at ActionAid UK
My first trip to Brazil has been quite an experience. What struck me immediately about the World Social Forum was the amazing atmosphere, you could feel the power of people trying to transform society all round the world.
The meeting had been billed as the biggest annual meeting of social movements and campaigners, and it did not disappoint. But despite the fact that over 100,000 people, including big names such as actor Danny Glover and author Arundathi Roy, descended on Porto Alegre, the city remained amazingly calm.
Hundreds of demonstrations went off without any violence. Peaceful protest
The police mixed with activists and at times it was difficult to distinguish between the parties and protests.
At first I was worried because I thought the events might just end up being a talking shops for campaigners who already knew the issues and were preaching to the converted. 15,000 people listening to Noam Chomsky's thoughts on globalisation But when I went to see Noam Chomsky speak I was very taken aback.
More than 15,000 people were packed into a stadium listening to what Mr Chomsky had to say about globalisation, the US and war with Iraq.
These were not just hardened campaigners and people working for development agencies but individuals who had made their way to the Forum under their own steam because they were interested in the issues. Many of them were young people, who were staying at the youth camp, a tent city of around 40,000 people.
For me, one of the highlights of the Forum was the speech of the new Brazilian President, Lula.
There was an atmosphere of great hope. Brazilian hopes
People really believe that he will be able to combat poverty, not just in Brazil but around the world.
People came to the forum from all over the world
The Lula has great responsibility resting on his shoulders. I don't imagine that when he travelled to Davos for the World Economic Forum the welcome he got from the business leaders and political heavy weights was half as warm.
Throughout the Social Forum environmental issues were high on the agenda. I found talk about the new technologies of the multi-national corporations, such as GM, very scary. The general feeling was that this science is more likely to benefit big business rather than help alleviate poverty. Big firms under fire
As one activist put it, "new technology does not help combat injustice."
Words were turned into action during a demonstration against multinational biotech company, Monsanto. Campaigners from Greenpeace, ActionAid and other Brazilian groups picketed the company's Porto Alegre office, absailing down the building and hanging the banner, "Monsanto out of our food." The aim was to send a clear message to the multi-nationals that they should not threaten the livelihoods of poor farmers by taking control of the seed market and promoting GM crops. As Monsanto's share price has dramatically dropped, we know protests like this can make a difference.
Challenges ahead
After five days of meetings I am totally exhausted. A lot has been achieved but the challenge now is to come up with concrete plans. Everybody has dreams of a better world, even government officials. The challenge is how we are going to work together to put the sentiments expressed in Porto Alegre into action. Conference coverage

Ministers pressed on child labour
Primark said that only a tiny part of its clothing range was affected
Activists have urged the UK government to take action on child labour after clothing firm Primark fired three of its Indian suppliers who used children.The suppliers sub-contracted smaller firms, which were using child labour to carry out embroidery and sequin work. The BBC's Panorama programme, which carried out a six-month investigation, alerted Primark to the problems. John Hillary of the charity War on Want said the government "should be looking down the supply chain". 'Ruining generation'
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. War on Want's John Hillary on tackling child labour
He told the BBC: "We have health and safety regulations in all of the workplaces in this country so it's a fairly understood idea. "What we're saying is that the British government should be looking down the supply chain, all the way to the factories in China, in Bangladesh, in India, and they should be calling on our retailers to ensure that those workers have proper terms and conditions." Consumers are increasingly demanding that companies produce goods in an ethical manner, turning the spotlight on worker wages and working conditions. Child labour activist Bhuwan Ribhu said it harmed children "practically every which way". "Socially, morally, psychologically, physically," he said, "we are essentially ruining all our future generation." Under no circumstances would Primark ever knowingly permit such activities
Primark statement
"The information provided by the BBC enabled us to identify that illegal sub-contracting had been taking place and to take action accordingly," Primark explained. According to Primark, the garments affected accounted for 0.04% of the retailers' worldwide sourcing. It added that "the sub-contracting involved home working and in some instances children were also found to be working at home". "We take this lapse in standards very seriously indeed," said Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods. "Under no circumstances would Primark ever knowingly permit such activities, whether directly through its suppliers or through third party sub-contractors." Code of conductUnder the terms of its code of practice for suppliers, Primark prohibits the use of child labour in its manufacturing chain. Primark says it will terminate relations with suppliers guilty of certain "transgressions" and those unwilling to make the "necessary changes" to their employment practices when breaches of its code are uncovered. Primark has proved one of the UK High Street's unquestioned success stories in recent years, its mixture of low prices and accessible fashion proving a hit with varying age groups. It currently has more than 170 stores and made a £200m profit last year on total sales of more than £1.6bn. HAVE YOUR SAY
If the price is unbelievably cheap, the goods will not have been ethically made Alan Davies
Send us your comments
Leading European and US retailers have come under growing pressure to ensure that workers in their supply chain - particularly in labour-intensive markets such as India and China - are not exploited. Companies such as Nike have responded to consumer concerns about ethical standards in the retail industry by making public details of all their suppliers. But charities and fairtrade groups have criticised other retailers for failing to follow suit and argued that many popular products continue to be sold in developed countries at a fraction of their true cost of production. A Panorama special on Primark will be broadcast on BBC1 at 9pm on 23 June.Update June 2011: The BBC Trust has upheld a complaint
from Primark about the Panorama programme.

Spanish businessman 'shot by Eta'
ETA has carried out attacks against companies working on the rail project
A businessman has been shot dead outside a restaurant in Azpeitia in the Basque region of northern Spain.
Spanish police say they suspect the Basque separatist group Eta is behind the killing.
Local media say Ignacio Uria Mendizabal, 71, worked for a company building a high-speed train link, a project previously targeted by Eta.
The shooting comes less than a month after the arrest of the suspected operational head of Eta.
Mikel Garikoitz Aspiazu Rubina, also known as "Txeroki", was arrested in southern France on 17 November.
The Spanish interior ministry had said it expected there to be retaliation for the arrest.
Rail project
Officials say Mr Uria Mendizabal was shot several times in the car park of a restaurant in Azpeitia, near San Sebastian.
Media reports say he was shot in the head and the chest by several people who then fled the scene in a car.
Mr Uria Mendizabal was the head of the construction company, Altuna y Uria, that was working on a rail link in the region.
Eta has been blamed for three bomb attacks against companies working on the project already this year, though none caused casualties.
The group is opposed to the train link, which will connect the Basque cities of Vitoria, San Sebastian and Bilbao to the capital, Madrid.
The shooting happened a day before Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero was due to visit the region.

'My fight to stop IVF mix-ups'
Fertilising eggs from the wrong sperm donor is a nightmare scenario for IVF clinics, which came to light in the case of a white woman in Leeds who found herself giving birth to black twins in 2002. But The Report's Nadene Ghouri has since found a routine neglect of safeguards to prevent such mix-ups at a major London hospital led one embryologist to turn whistle-blower.
Two witnesses should verify that the right sperm fertilised the right eggs
It was in January 2004 that clinical embryologist Bea Pavlovic, first became worried by errors in the patient notes she was checking at Guys Hospital, London. Signatures were missing which should have stated which sperm had fertilised which egg and whether security checks had been performed. Normally two people have to witness and check procedures - including that the right sperm has fertilised the right eggs - and sign documents to verify that at the time they carry out the procedure. "I have no words to explain how important this is - it is paramount," she told The Report. She added: "My first duty was to report this to my superiors." Photocopied notesMs Pavlovic claims when she raised this verbally she was called a "broken record". A year on she felt the concerns were not listened to and she photocopied patient records and took them home. "I didn't feel very proud of having to do that but I knew without evidence I would not have anything there to prove," she said.
LISTEN TO THE REPORT
BBC Radio 4,
Thursday 27 August at 2000 BST

Eventually she wrote to the hospital's lead clinician and to IVF watchdog the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Bea Pavlovic was sacked, lost her Employment Tribunal case and faced being struck off by her professional body when the hospital trust alleged she had potentially breached confidentiality by taking copies of patient notes home as evidence. But she was not struck off, because although a Health Professional Council hearing in November 2008 agreed that she had risked breaching patient confidentiality, it also said she had "acted in the patients' best interests in doing so". Bea said she felt vindicated by the decision and earlier this year it was revealed there had been a mix-up at Guys Hospital. In the case of two couples the wrong sperm was injected into the wrong eggs.
Unless there's action from both the clinics and the HFEA then we're going to se some very serious mix ups in the future.
Guy Forster, solicitor
"I was very sad... there were mixed feelings, from shock, sadness, that I was right in everything I said." 'More errors'Ms Pavlovic, who said she came across the errors by accident, added: "One has to ask how many are there that have not been picked up." A statement from Guys and St Thomas's Hospital said: "We have already acted to minimise the risk of similar incidents happening again." It added that the assisted conception unit has moved to a £4.2m state of the art new unit which provides added assurance that patient samples are handled correctly. The trust has also introduced electronic tagging of samples. But there are wider concerns over embryo mix-ups in IVF clinics. Earlier this year Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust agreed to pay undisclosed damages to a couple whose last remaining embryo was wrongly given to another woman, after admitting there had been failures in care.
If we're not careful we will drive our patients abroad for treatment because our clinics are more severe and do not allow things that clinics abroad allow
Professor Lisa Jardine, chair HFEA
The couple's solicitor, Guy Forster, told The Report: "I have no doubt unless more is done these incidents will keep occurring... unless there's action from both the clinics and the HFEA then we're going to see some very serious mix-ups in the future." 'No clampdown'His concerns were echoed by Professor Brian Toft, who investigated the 2002 Leeds mix-up for the HFEA. Professor Toft said he was concerned that there would be further "disasters" unless the HFEA started applying sanctions to clinics which were ignoring safety guidelines. After the Cardiff case he wrote to Health Secretary Andy Burnham. "I have to say I am very disappointed because he didn't write (back) to me personally but had someone in the Customer Services Department do it," he said. However Professor Lisa Jardine, chair of the HFEA, said there were dangers in implementing too strict a regime. "In the rest of Europe and in America we're regarded as laughably tough. "Now if we're not careful we will drive our patients abroad for treatment because our clinics are more severe and do not allow things that clinics abroad allow." The Report is on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday 27 August at 2000 BST. You can also listen via the BBC iPlayer
after broadcast or download the podcast.

Hi-tech vroom powers future cars
Dot.life - where technology meets life, every Monday
By Alfred Hermida
BBC News Online technology editor
The car is evolving into a hi-tech beast packed with computing power, designed to look after every whim of driver and passengers.
Hi-tech, but at high cost
Vehicles already have dozens of small computers, keeping an eye on everything from petrol consumption to suspension. But future models could also come with smart navigation systems, wireless internet connections and top notch audio systems.
For those with the cash, the car of the future is on sale today in the shape of BMW's 5 series or Honda's Accura TL.
Included in the technology packed into the $40,000 BMW is a display which floats information such as speed and navigation onto the windshield.
As for Honda's $35,000 auto, it has a voice-controlled navigation system, as well as the first DVD audio system built into a car.
Avoiding jams
"It is actually not distracting, everything that is in this car is to have the exact opposite effect," says Honda's Brett Thacher.
Speak your destination
"You don't have to take your eyes off the road at all. As far as the buttons are concerned, they are all on the steering wheel and a lot of it is voice-activated so all I have to do is talk to the car."
The Accura uses Bluetooth wireless technology that can talk to a mobile phone with the same system, which means the driver need not take their hands off the wheel to make a call.
Satellite navigation systems are still something that is only seen in high-end or special edition cars. But these could come as standard in the next three to seven years, says David Martell, boss of UK company Trafficmaster.
The firm offers a system called SmartNav, which combines satellite navigation with information about roadworks, accidents and delays. This is compiled at the company's headquarters and transmitted to a car, rather than by a costly onboard computer.
"You can just jump in the car, press a button and the car tells you where to go, keeps you away from the traffic jams and alerts you to speed cameras," says Mr Martell.
Black box recorder
Navigation systems are an example of how computing technology is gradually encroaching into automobiles. Some car repair shops are even starting to stock hard drives alongside other spare parts.
Demand for navigation, real-time traffic information and in-car entertainment is definitely picking up
Carl Franklin, technology analyst
"Every car is going to have a disk drive," says Ian Vogelesang, vice president of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies.
The drive could be used as the core of a car's entertainment system, storing hours of music and video. Or it could be combined with sensors and mapping technology to keep track of every twist and turn.
"Once you have a hard drive for GPS navigation and the entertainment system, why not have cheap cameras at the corner of a car to keep you in a lane?" says Mr Vogelesang. "The hard drive then forms a sort of black box recorder."
Auto entertainment
Computing technology could also make long, dull car journeys a thing of the past. DVD systems built into a headrest are now available, for the viewing pleasure of those in the back seat.
One way to keep the children quiet
But at $1,800, this can be an expensive way to keep the children quiet on long journeys. A cheaper option is a portable DVD with built-in speakers, which plugs into the cigarette lighter.
"We've noticed that the demand for navigation, real-time traffic information and in-car entertainment systems is definitely picking up," says Carl Franklin, technology analyst at Bridgewell Securities. "These are systems that help to reduce the stress of driving, especially on long journeys, so they will be the first wave of computing products to be fitted in cars."
Safe driving
Future cars are likely to come packed with all sorts of gadgets, from a satellite TV tuner to a voice-activated GPS navigation system.
But Mr Franklin urges caution about the trend to put more and more technology in vehicles.
"Voice recognition technology has improved to the point where it could easily be used in cars and head-up displays might find their way into high-end models. "The manufacturers will have to be certain they aren't too distracting."

Section 28 more symbol than substance
Schools are to receive new guidelines on sex education
Throughout all the noisy debates over the government's attempts to abolish Section 28, an awkward and often overlooked fact has been that it has never applied to schools.
But Section 28, which prohibits local authorities from promoting homosexuality, has long since become such a dividing line for attitudes towards homosexuality that the symbolic battle has taken on a life of its own, regardless of any practical application in the classroom.
School governors and heads set sex education policy - and have never been subject to Section 28
The government is once again seeking to overturn the legislation - a move which it hopes will be made easier by the passing of its revised sex education guidelines through the House of Lords last week.
The new guidelines seek to achieve a balance between family values and tolerance for same-sex relationships - promoting "family life, marriage and stable loving relationships".
But this compromise will be angrily rejected by the defenders of Section 28, who will again argue that the measure is a necessary security against the promotion of homosexuality.
Section 28 does not apply, and never has applied, to the activities of individual schools in England.
Schools Minister Jacqui Smith Whether Section 28 is retained or abolished, there will be no direct impact on schools - although there have been claims that the legislation creates an atmosphere which makes anti-gay bullying more likely.
In the previous round of attempts at abolishing the legislation, Schools Minister Jacqui Smith spelt out: "Section 28 does not apply, and never has applied, to the activities of individual schools in England. It applies only to the activities of local authorities."
Red-herring
As local authorities have no influence over the teaching of sex education in schools, the measure has never directly affected schools - and despite its fearsome reputation, the Department for Education says that the legislation has never been used.
Head teachers' leader, David Hart, labelled the debate "unreal" and local government leader, Graham Lane described the arguments as a "charade" and a "red herring" - but nonetheless the battle has rumbled on.
Despite its repeated reminders that Section 28 does not affect what is taught in schools, the government has pursued its abolition - arguing that it is discriminatory and encourages prejudice.
This view is supported by the National Union of Teachers, which at its annual conference this year called on the government to repeal the legislation, as its retention was sending a negative message to gay pupils and teachers.
Even though teachers are not covered by Section 28, delegates talked of the "long shadow" of legislation which gave the impression that homosexuality in the classroom or staffroom would not be tolerated. The government will also argue that the new statutory guidelines on sex education will be a more effective endorsement of family values than could have been achieved by a symbolic measure such as Section 28.
Head teachers and boards of governors, who are exempt from the requirements of Section 28, determine sex education policy, after consultation with parents - with the local authority having no rights over what is taught. The new guidelines will place requirements on schools, which its supporters argue, will provide a clearer responsibility for sex education teachers to acknowledge the importance of marriage and family life.

US omits terror groups from list
By Mark Devenport
BBC Northern Ireland political editor
The US State Department's report on patterns of global terrorism contains a wealth of detail on Northern Ireland's paramilitary groups, with some notable absences. Northern Ireland political editor Mark Devenport reports on which groups are on the United States' 'A' list and why some groups did not feature in the report.
The US Envoy to Northern Ireland, Richard Haass, is reported to be examining a short list of prominent people on the US diplomatic and political scene who might be interested in serving on the new Independent Monitoring Commission. An announcement of the Commission team in shadow form is now thought to be likely next month. The timetable has apparently slipped as officials pour over the fine detail of the Commission's remit in an attempt to make the body acceptable both to sceptical unionists and suspicious republicans.
Many Real IRA members are former Provisional IRA members who bring to RIRA a wealth of experience in terrorist tactics and bomb making
US government report
Whenever the US does have its nominee in place he or she will no doubt want to get briefed on the fine detail of the paramilitary scene in Northern Ireland, which the Commission is meant to be monitoring. An obvious starting point might be the US State Department's own report, "Patterns of Global Terrorism", which came out earlier this year. The report contains a wealth of detail on most Northern Ireland based paramilitary groups. But there are a couple of glaring omissions.
One of the report's appendices contains a list of the 36 groups which the US government has designated as foreign terrorist organisations. The only Irish group to make this 'A' list of terror, if that's the right description, is the Real IRA, the faction which carried out the Omagh bombing. The US report describes the Real IRA as the "clandestine armed wing of the 32-County Sovereignty Movement, a 'political pressure group' dedicated to removing British forces from Northern Ireland and unifying Ireland." It says "many Real IRA members are former Provisional IRA members who left that organization following the Provisional IRA cease-fire and bring to RIRA a wealth of experience in terrorist tactics and bombmaking." It estimates the Real IRA's strength as "100 to 200 activists plus possible limited support from IRA hardliners dissatisfied with the IRA cease-fire and other republican sympathizers." A separate appendix, or 'B' list deals with 38 other organisations who for one reason or another did not merit the US government's worst opprobrium. In Northern Ireland, that is either because the groups concerned are on ceasefire, or because they are not deemed significant enough to make the 'A' list. David Ervine believes the UVF aren't listed as they don't pose a threat to the peace process
The 'B' list includes major groups like the IRA and the UDA/UFF as well as factions such as the LVF, the Red Hand Defenders and the Continuity IRA. But there is no mention of one of the biggest and most potent loyalist terror groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force, nor of the republican splinter group, the INLA.
David Ervine, whose Progressive Unionist Party is closely linked to the UVF, said it was hard to understand why the UVF didn't feature. With his tongue in his cheek, he suggested that it might be the fruits of all his assiduous lobbying in Washington. More seriously, he suggested "maybe it's because the UVF don't pose a specific threat to the peace process and aren't wanting to seek political advantage through military action". But to be fair to the State Department it looks more like a clerical error than a belief that the UVF has gone out of business. 'Particularly vicious'
An insider said "we're a huge organisation; these things happen". The entry for the Loyalist Volunteer Force describes the LVF as a faction "composed largely of UVF hardliners who have sought to prevent a political settlement with Irish nationalists in Northern Ireland by attacking Catholic politicians, civilians, and Protestant politicians who endorse the Northern Ireland peace process". So it's pretty clear that Washington knows the UVF still exists.
The UVF to one side, the other details in the report should make interesting reading for any would be US Monitoring Commissioner. The omission of the UVF seems to be a clerical error
Described as "particularly vicious", the LVF is said to have "300 members, half of whom are active." The Red Hand Defenders is referred to as "a cover name often used by elements of the banned UDA and LVF". But it also appears the US believe the Red Hand Defenders has some existence in its own right as it is rated as having "up to 20 members, some of whom have experience in terrorist tactics and bombmaking".
The Ulster Defence Association a.k.a Ulster Freedom Fighters is acknowledged to be "the largest loyalist paramilitary group" with anything from "2,000 to 5,000 members, with several hundred active in paramilitary operations". The report says "the UDA/UFF has evolved into a criminal organization involved in drug trafficking and other moneymaking criminal activities".
On the republican side, the Irish National Liberation Army or INLA does not feature, even though it remains very much in existence.
The Continuity IRA is described as "the clandestine armed wing of Republican Sinn Fein", which is thought to have "fewer than 50 hard-core activists". The US report claims that "police counter-terrorist operations have reduced the group's strength, but CIRA has been able to reconstitute its membership through active recruiting efforts."
The US State Department notes that the Provisional IRA is maintaining a ceasefire but adds that it "retains the ability to conduct paramilitary operations. The IRA's extensive criminal activities reportedly provide the organizations with millions of dollars each year." It says the IRA has "several hundred members, plus several thousand sympathizers-despite the defection of some members to RIRA and CIRA". In a section sub-titled "External Aid" it points out that that IRA "has in the past received aid from a variety of groups and countries and considerable training and arms from Libya and the PLO". It goes on: "The group is also suspected of receiving funds, arms, and other terrorist-related materiel from sympathizers in the United States. "Similarities in operations suggest links to (the Basque separatist group) ETA and the (Colombian Marxist organisation) FARC."
When they start work, the Independent Monitoring Commission could do worse than to keep a copy of "Patterns of Global Terrorism" on their bookshelves. But they should also invest, quite separately, in a history of the UVF and the INLA.

What is parliament and how does it work? Once elected, MPs will spend much of their time in Westminster, where parliament is based. MPs will take their seats in the House of Commons where they will meet to debate new laws and make decisions about how the UK is run.
See a non-Flash version of this feature
One of an MP's most important roles is to help make and change the laws governing the UK. Both houses of parliament generally have to agree on a new law - after a process which can take months, or even years. Click through the slideshow to find out about the key stages in the passage of a bill.
How new laws are made
After a new government is elected, the Queen makes a speech to Parliament which includes a list of bills or proposals for new laws. Some of these bills may have already been through one or two kinds of consultation: green papers contain ideas for bills, white papers include more definite proposals. Most bills start in the Commons. The first reading is a formality. At the second reading MPs debate the main principles. In 2005 Labour had plans to extend maternity leave. The Work and Families bill had broad support at second reading so the bill moved to committee stage without the need for a vote.
MPs can introduce their own legislation in the form of a private members' bill. In 2009 Labour MP Julie Morgan wanted a ban on under-18s from using sunbeds. She won government backing and her bill moved to the committee stage - without government support a bill is not likely to progress any further.
All the bills that pass the second reading are considered by a public bill committee of at least 16 MPs. They consider a bill line by line and may introduce amendments. They can call experts to give evidence and they may meet several times before returning the bill to the Commons.
At the report stage further changes can be made. At this point there could be a rebellion and parts of the bill might be defeated in a vote when MPs divide into two areas known as the Aye and No lobbies. The bill then moves to a third reading when there is often a brief debate before it goes to the Lords.
A bill goes through the same process in the Lords. This time, all members can take part at committee stage. Most bills need the Lords' approval but occasionally the Commons will use the Parliament Act to pass a bill into law. This happened in 2004 when the act was used to force through a hunting ban.
Any Lords' amendments are returned to the Commons for consideration. A bill can go backwards and forwards several times before both houses agree on a final version and it gets the royal assent. Labour's bill on maternity leave was unopposed so it became an act that came into force in April 2007. BACK

A close encounter at an alien exhibition
An exhibition which looks at all things alien has opened at the Science Museum.
Newsround Online's Clare Youell went along with Press Packer Lauren to see if the truth really was out there...
Click here to see Lauren's day in pix
Is there anybody out there?
Well yes.
There's lots of bodies at this Science Museum exhibition, and most of them are more than a little strange.
A Vogon
You can get up close and personal with ET, the Daleks, Vogons and all sorts of movie monsters and aliens from the deep.
The exhibition looks at our fascination with alien life, from TV and book legends, to 'real life' aliens, and man's constant attempts to prove there is life on other planets.
Giant brain
It's split up into four 'zones'.
The first is Alien Fiction where you can see video clips, toys, books and interactive displays on creatures from outer space which have gripped us over the years, like Pokemon, the Clangers, Star Trek and creatures from Doctor Who.
Press Packer Lauren
An amusing display lets you put your head inside a giant brain, and then you press a button to see which alien it belongs to.
And you can watch footage of what claims to be 'genuine' footage of a UFO.
Freaky
Then there's Alien Science, which, perhaps most spookily of all, looks at real creatures which are so weird and freaky that they could almost be from another world.
There's big glass jars with some of the strangest creatures you've ever seen in them. Many come from the depths of the ocean.
Do YOU believe in aliens? Click here to comment
There's fish with enormous spiky teeth poking out of their mouths, a kind of jellyfish-octopus with one eye, and what can only be described as a giant worm with a huge mouth and razor-sharp teeth.
Pop up
One of the 'virtual alien planets'
Alien Worlds is the best interactive section. Teams of scientists have come together to produce two 'virtual planets' which are projected onto big screens.
When you touch the screens, facts about the aliens which might live there pop up, and you can find out all about how they might live and what they'd look like.
One of the aliens claims to have five hearts, which seems a bit greedy. (Even Doctor Who only has two!)
Space
The fourth zone is Alien Communications, which focuses on contacting creatures from other worlds.
It explains how scientists have been sending out messages into space for years, and are poised to leap into action should they ever get a reply!
UFOs
Even if you don't believe in aliens, this exhibition certainly makes you think.
Could there be life on other planets?
An interactive planetary display
Why do so many people claim they've seen aliens or UFOs? Why do sooo many books and films, and myths and legends, often going back centuries, describe the same spooky experiences?
Maybe, one day, we'll find out...

2003: Hutton Inquiry hears final arguments
The inquiry into the death of weapons expert Dr David Kelly has ended with the closing statements of lawyers from all sides.
Today's final hearing saw bitter criticism of the Ministry of Defence from the Kelly family, and an equally strong attack on the BBC by the lawyer representing the government.
The inquiry has spent six weeks hearing evidence from more than 70 witnesses, including the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and key figures from the BBC and the intelligence services.
Lord Hutton will now consider his report, and says he hopes to present his findings later this year.
Government 'duplicity'
The inquiry has been looking into the circumstances surrounding the apparent suicide of Dr Kelly, soon after he was named as the suspected source of a BBC report claiming the government "sexed up" a dossier on the threat from Iraq.
The first to speak was the Kelly family's lawyer, Jeremy Gompertz QC.
He outlined the two main outcomes the family wants from the inquiry:
"One - that the duplicity of the government in their handling of Dr Kelly should be exposed; and two - that the systemic failures at the Ministry of Defence should be identified and remedied so as to ensure as far as is humanly possible that no-one else should suffer the ordeal endured by Dr Kelly."
The Defence Minister, Geoff Hoon, has been under increasing pressure to resign over the role of his department, which ultimately confirmed Dr Kelly's name to the press.
'Political mudslinging'
Jonathan Sumption QC, for the government, strongly criticised the BBC, saying the Corporation had never acknowledged how serious the allegations it broadcast really were.
The BBC, he said, "seemed to have regarded this as a routine piece of political mudslinging, chatter in the air".
However, the BBC's lawyer, Andrew Caldecott QC, pointed out that Dr Kelly had spoken to three separate journalists at the BBC about his concerns that the Iraq dossier had been subject to "political interference".
He said the BBC did not present the criticisms as true, but it did present them as credible.
"That broad judgement, the BBC defends as entirely right," Mr Caldecott said.

Tough talks on final day of Hutton inquiry
In Context
Lord Hutton published his report on 18 January 2004.
He was highly critical of BBC governors for failing to investigate properly Downing Street's complaints.
As a result, the BBC chairman Gavyn Davies, the corporation's Director General, Greg Dyke, and reporter Andrew Gilligan resigned.
Lord Hutton absolved the government of any kind of "dishonourable, underhand or duplicitious strategy" in the leaking of Dr Kelly's name to the press.
But he said the Ministry of Defence was "at fault" for failing to tell Dr Kelly that his identity as the suspected source would be confirmed to journalists who suggested it.
He said Mr Gilligan's report that the Iraq dossier was sexed up was "unfounded" and that Joint Intelligence Committee chairman John Scarlett had acted to ensure the dossier was consistent with reliable intelligence.
In June 2004, the BBC published an internal review of its journalism. The Neil Report recommended a new emphasis on the training of journalists.
The following month, the government came under further pressure over its decision to go to war in Iraq as the Butler Report criticised the "thinness" of the intelligence used to justify the war.

Robson has been chasing the former Manchester United man since last week and he will go straight into their squad to play Palace on Saturday.
Wallwork will spend a month on loan at Valley Parade after falling out of favour with Baggies boss Gary Megson at The Hawthorns.

Fulham land Radzinski
Radzinski's career statistics
Fulham have signed striker Tomasz Radzinski from Everton for an undisclosed fee, subject to a medical.
The 30-year-old has signed a three-year deal to become manager Chris Coleman's third addition in the last fortnight.
"This has been a great two weeks for the club in terms of player activity," Coleman told the club's website.
"I am delighted we have secured the services of three fine additions to our current squad in Andy Cole, Claus Jensen and now Tomasz."
The fee is reported to be about �1.75m for Radzinski, who had 12 months to run on his Goodison Park contract.
The forward, who joined Everton from Anderlecht three years ago, rejected a new three-year deal and publicly criticised manager David Moyes.
Have Your Say Is Radzinski a good buy for Fulham?
The Merseyside club were furious with Radzinski for refusing a deal he had originally demanded, then urging England striker Wayne Rooney to quit the club.
His fierce criticism of Moyes and the lack of new signings at the club made his swift departure almost inevitable.
Coleman was keen to seal the deal after being handed the �3m he received from Tottenham for Sean Davis.
Radzinski scored eight goals in 34 appearances last season.
