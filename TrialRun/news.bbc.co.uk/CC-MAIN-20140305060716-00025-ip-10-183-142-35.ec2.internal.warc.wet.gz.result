What's keeping women out of the labs?
Matt Silver
Producer, BBC Science Radio
Larry Summers' comments about women caused controversy
If you've worked your way to the top in a university maths, physics or engineering department - you're very unlikely to be a woman. But why should this be? In 2005, Harvard University president Larry Summers provoked a storm of protest when he suggested that at least part of the reason for the dearth of women in these fields was biological - in other words, the result of innate differences in tastes and aptitudes between the sexes. Professor Helen Haste, a psychologist at the University of Bath, was working at Harvard at the time. She recalls how the speech revived some uncomfortable memories: "Women scientists who had gone into the profession before the late 1970s told quite harrowing stories of discrimination - sexist comments by their own supervisors, such as 'women have no place in laboratories, they should be at home looking after their children'. "Also some institutions had, for example, a dozen post-doctoral fellowships, only one of which was earmarked for women."
Nature v nurture
Despite changing attitudes, there are still very few women at the highest levels in certain fields. In 2005/6, while more than half of all UK students in higher education were female, just 3% of maths and 2% of civil engineering professors were women, a recent study revealed. Professor David Geary, of the University of Missouri in the US, suggests there are two key difference between the sexes that might account for the disparity in numbers. The first is a difference in spatial abilities - the capacity to visualise things, particularly in three dimensions. Some say spatial ability may be a factor in the debate
The second is an increased interest in objects and how things work. According to Professor Geary: "Males are better in both of those areas, and both areas contribute to interest in maths and engineering, and performance in some areas."
But how can we be sure that these differences are genuinely innate and not a result of upbringing and the culture that surrounds us?
Professor Geary says: "These differences are found very early on in life. "If you look at interest in toy cars or mechanical objects, boys like those much more from the pre-school years. "Also, girls who have been exposed to a testosterone-like hormone in the womb show boy-like toy preferences."
'Done to death'
But Helen Haste thinks the evidence on spatial skills is overplayed.
She says: "This is one of these things that's done to death. "Even if we found a subject for which it was an absolutely crucial skill, we would expect 60% of the people taking that subject to be male and 40% to be female. "More importantly, we're only surmising that spatial reasoning is such a crucial element in say engineering or physics that it would cause the kind of differences that we've found in the past."
Others believe genetic differences are controlling career choices
More women than ever are entering higher education. For example, the proportion of women taking medicine has doubled since the 1960s and women now account for more than half of all medical students. "When these young people are getting to the point of gaining professorial positions, there will be much greater numbers of women" says Professor Haste. But Dr Helena Cronin, who studies evolutionary theory and sex difference at the London School of Economics, argues that past statistics give no indication of what might happen in the future. She says: "On that basis, women marathon runners, who have been catching up with men since the 1920s, were predicted to overtake men in the 1990s, and presumably would be running beyond the speed of light if it were continued for long enough."
According to Dr Cronin, it's the numbers of men at the extremes of ability that are most telling: "For males, the difference between the worst and the best is far, far greater. "This is a very important aspect of male-female differences. "One way of looking at this is that among males there are more dumbbells, but there are also more Nobels." Politically correct science
So what conclusions can we draw from this closely-fought scientific argument? For Professor Haste, history tells us this is an area in which we should tread carefully. She says: "I've never subscribed to the view that it's the correct feminist line to say there are no differences.
"But let's not forget that historically, evolutionary arguments have often been used to justify what seemed to be some normal aspect of life at the time - for example, the extreme racism of the late 19th century."
Dr Cronin disagrees: "If people use the science wrongly, you should be objecting to them, not to the science." She describes Harvard's reaction to Larry Summers' speech as "shameful", and sees it as an example of science being hijacked by politically-correct ideology. She says those who are striving for 50/50 sex ratios across the sciences should look at the scientific evidence first. She says: "If you want to change the world, first you have to understand it."
Hear Dr Helena Cronin and Professor Helen Haste debate the issues in the first edition of Science Friction on Thursday, 9 August 2007 at 2100 BST on BBC Radio 4. You can listen to the programme for up to seven days after broadcast on BBC Radio 4's

Newsreel archive launched online
Path� became a staple in British cinemas
Hundreds of hours of historic newsreel footage can be viewed free of charge on the internet after Path� put its archive online. The bi-weekly news bulletins, which played in cinemas from 1910 to 1970, have been released via the Path� website thanks to a grant from the National Lottery.
More than 3,500 hours of footage is available.
Path� history
Began in 1890's Paris where founder, Charles Path�, pioneered the development of the moving image
Established in London in 1902, and by 1910 was producing bi-weekly newsreel, the Path� Gazette
Finished in 1970 - with more than 90,000 items
British Path� is owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust Group
While those requiring the footage for broadcasting or "professional" use still require a licence, the website offers a free preview service for the general public.
Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell was due to launch the new site in London on Tuesday, thanks to the �1 million grant from the Lottery's New Opportunities Fund.
Ms Jowell said: "National lottery good cause funding has enabled British Path� to bring about
this world first, both in terms of technical achievement and in bringing 20th
Century newsreel to the small screen of Internet users of all ages." The New Opportunities fund will also take a travelling Internet suite it calls a "digi-van" to
disadvantaged areas throughout south London.
The latest online digital imaging technologies have been used for the Path� project. Specialists at Path� spent over 50,000 hours to process the priceless 35mm film archive to digital video. The film had been stored in 30,000 square feet of specialised warehousing. Its digital descendant, however, takes up about five square feet on a Path� storage computer. It has been streamlined so it can be downloaded quickly over an ordinary household 56K modem, while quality remains good enough to view at a reasonable size on the screen. WATCH/LISTEN

In pictures: Olympic torch in S Korea
There have been skirmishes on the streets of Seoul as the Olympic torch made its way through the South Korean capital on the latest leg of its journey towards Beijing.
Eight thousand police were deployed along the route to separate thousands of Chinese students from anti-China demonstrators.
The Chinese students waved flags and chanted slogans in support of their government. "One China!" they roared in reference to pro-Tibet protests in the city.
Some threw objects and attacked protesters demonstrating against China's policy of repatriating North Korean refugees, many of whom face severe punishment when they arrive home. Although one North Korean defector attempted to set himself on fire to stop the relay, the torch successfully completed its route around the city.
The Olympic flame will now move on to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, for the next leg of the relay on Monday. Back

Baath officials backed to rebuild Iraq
Looting is testing British troops in Basra
Baath Party members who were loyal to Saddam Hussein will take part in the reconstruction of Iraq, according to Geoff Hoon.
"They had a system of administration that will deliver," the defence secretary told The Observer.
And many were "perfectly decent people who have not participated in any
atrocities".
Mr Hoon later told the BBC it was important to use policing to stamp out the looting which had happened in Iraqi cities.
The defence secretary also said he was confident Saddam Hussein or his remains would be found - as would weapons of mass destruction.
There has already been anger in the southern city of Basra after the man chosen by the British forces there to run the city was revealed to be a Baath Party member.
Mr Hoon told the newspaper: "It is understandable people that have lived in dread and terror of this organisation should go and kick in a few doors."
But he added: "We have to ensure it does not get out of hand."
Mixed picture
The defence secretary told BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend on Sunday that he did not condone looting, which had produced "some awful images".
"We will try and stop looting wherever it occurs, but it has been difficult in some of the cities in the immediate aftermath of their liberation," said Mr Hoon.
There was not a consistent picture over Iraq, he said, so coalition troops were handing out food in southern cities and still fighting in parts of the north.
The first patrols between British forces and former Iraqi police officers had now begun in Basra and were a "good sign for the future", he said.
Hoon: Weapons finds should be independently verified
Mr Hoon said it was dangerous to speculate about what had happened to Saddam Hussein.
But he added: "I am still confident that either he or his remains will be found."
He was also "convinced" there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and argued any finds should be verified by an independent authority.
The AFP news agency later reported senior US Marines officers saying they had found 278 artillery shells carrying a substance which tested positive as a chemical agent.
Jack Straw is flying to Bahrain on Sunday as he embarks on a tour of Gulf states to discuss the reconstruction of Iraq.
The foreign secretary will visit Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, where he will meet US interim administrator for Iraq, Jay Garner.
Syrian warnings
Foreign Office Minister Mike O'Brien will travel to Syria and Iran, who fear they could become American targets in future.
Mr Straw and Mr O'Brien will discuss a "range of bilateral issues, as well as Iraq", according to the Foreign Office.
On Thursday Mr Straw warned Syria "to end any and all assistance to the Iraqi regime and to co-operate fully with the people of Iraq and with the coalition forces".
He urged Syrians to "make a decisive break with the past and so contribute to a better future for the entire region". On Sunday Secretary of State Colin Powell warned Syria not to offer any "safe haven" for Iraqi officials fleeing Baghdad.
Syria insists it has offered no help to the Iraqi regime, accusing the US of using the claims to divert attention from American failures.
Restore normality
On Saturday, Jacques Chirac has telephoned Tony Blair to underline his argument that only the UN can effectively restore normality to Iraq.
Downing Street said the two leaders discussed Iraq and other international issues for half an hour.
The call came after President Chirac rang to brief Mr Blair on his discussions with fellow anti-war leaders, German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Russian president Vladimir Putin, in St Petersburg, Russia.
Mr Blair had reportedly refused an invitation to attend.
The prime minister and US President George Bush agreed in Belfast this week that the UN should have a "vital role" in the reconstruction of Iraq.
On Monday, Mr Blair will update MPs on the latest developments in Iraq in a Commons statement.

Panel to right Nazi wrongs
Handed back: The Three Stages of Life
The government is to set up an advisory panel to investigate claims for the return of art looted by the Nazis from Jewish owners during the war.
Members of the Spoliation Advisory Panel will have the power to settle disputes.
But there will be no legislation brought in to ensure artworks are returned.
Anne Webber, chairwoman on the Commission on Looted Art, said she was disappointed the government had not taken a stronger stance.
"It appears this procedure will leave Britain completely out of line with the rest of the world," she told The Guardian.
More than 350 works
The panel will consider claims arising anywhere in the UK.
Question-marks surround more than 350 paintings and sculptures hanging in British museums and galleries.
Arts minister Alan Howarth will announce the terms of the panel when he replies to a parliamentary question on Thursday.
Our commitment to right these historical wrongs should not be doubted
Alan Howarth He indicated in The Guardian that the resolution of claims could include restitution of the work of art, financial compensation, or moral recompense by displaying the object's history next to it.
"If the panel recommend restitution - and both the claimant and present owner accept the judgement - the government will take the panel's recommendation very seriously indeed," Mr Howarth wrote.
He said the government remained committed to "righting these historical wrongs".
But British galleries are prevented under current British law from disposing of art that they hold in trust for the nation.
"It may well not be a straightforward matter to identify just solutions," said the minister. "Whatever wrongs were done in the Nazi era, works of art were - we should start by assuming - acquired in good faith and have probably been held for the public benefit for considerable periods."
Painful matters
He stressed the new panel would have to deal with sensitive and emotive matters that "remain horribly painful to the families who may have suffered, among other unspeakable things, the looting of cherished and valuable possessions".
A nationwide audit is currently under way to investigate exactly how many artworks are suspected of being looted by the Nazis.
During the period 1933 to 1945, it is believed the Nazis oversaw the looting of hundreds of thousands of paintings and sculptures.
The World Jewish Congress estimates that about 110,000 artworks remain unaccounted for.
Suspicion surrounds Picasso's Weeping Woman
In London's Tate Gallery alone, around 80 paintings are suspected of having a Nazi provenance.
These include Paul C�zanne's The Avenue of the Jas de Bouffan, Picasso's Head of a Woman and his Weeping Woman.
Rightful return
Some paintings have already been handed back to their original heirs.
In March, London's Royal Academy returned The Three Stages of Life by Count Leopold von Kalckreuth to the descendants of Elizabeth Gotthilf, who fled Vienna in the wake of the Nazi invasion.
The picture had been on loan from the Neue Pinakothek gallery in Munich.
It became the first work exhibited in Britain to become the object of restitution by The Commission for Looted Art in Europe. Search BBC News Online

Humans put orangutans in danger
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Orangutan homes destroyed
Orangutans are being forced out of their natural habitat in Indonesian Borneo to make way for farming palm oil, a BBC investigation has found.Palm oil is a cheap vegetable oil. It's in loads of foods but it's hardly ever written on packet labels. The orangutan population in the area has halved because they've been pushed out to make room for palm oil farms. The investigation claims the Indonesian government admits 50,000 orangutans have died because of de-forestation. Don't hang around - try our monkeys & apes quiz
As the rainforests are burned to make way for farming palm oil, orangutans are forced to move homes. It's thought sometimes they're even killed because workers see them as a nuisance when they're trying to clear the land. Orangutans
The name orangutan means person of the forest
They are the largest tree-living mammals
They eat insects, leaves, bark, flowers and fruit.
Palm oilExporting palm oil is something Indonesia relies on to bring money into the country. The oil is used in things like biscuits, margarine, bread and crisps made here in the UK. It is possible to find sustainable palm oil - meaning it comes from places that pass an environmental test - but only 3% of the world's palm oil is certified sustainable. And it's not just orangutans who are victims of palm oil farming. According to Greenpeace (an environmental charity), the industry creates massive amounts of greenhouse gases and is contributing to global warming.

1993: Rabin and Arafat shake on peace deal
VIDEO : Rabin and Arafat agree on peace deal
The Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, and the PLO leader, Yasser Arafat, have shaken hands before cheering crowds on the White House lawn in Washington.The handshake - the first ever in public between the two former arch enemies - marked the signing of a Declaration of Principles for peace between the Arabs and Israelis.Under the terms of the deal, Israel has agreed to withdraw its troops from Gaza Strip and West Bank by April 1994. Elections will be held in the territories to allow the Palestinians some form of self-government.A deadline for a final settlement has been set for February 1999.
"The peace of the brave is within our reach"
President Clinton
The deal has only been made possible by talks brokered by the Norwegians earlier in the year - and by the election of Mr Rabin's Labour government which includes the pro-peace campaigners Shimon Peres and Yossi Beilin.President Bill Clinton introduced the two leaders to the crowd of invited guests in front of the White House. By his side, were former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George Bush who had vigorously campaigned for peace during their terms in office.Mr Clinton said: "The peace of the brave is within our reach. Throughout the Middle East there is a great yearning for the quiet miracle of a normal life."We know a difficult road lies ahead. Every peace has its enemies."The leaders did not sign the declaration themselves. Instead, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and his Palestinian counterpart did the signing.Mr Rabin then addressed the crowd: "We who have fought against you the Palestinians, we say to you today in a loud and clear voice, enough of blood and tears, enough."Mr Arafat said: "The difficult decision we reached together was one that required great courage."The BBC's correspondent John Simpson said Mr Arafat had undoubtedly put his life on the line for this agreement.
In Context
The Declaration of Principles paved the way for Israel's first withdrawals from occupied territory and Yasser Arafat's triumphant return to Palestinian territory in July 1994. He was elected president of the Palestinian National Authority in 1996. Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist wanting to prevent further Israeli withdrawals on 4 November 1995.Binyamin Netanyahu of Likud won Israeli elections in 1996. He agreed to a withdrawal from Hebron in the West Bank but talks on further peace moves with the Palestinians stalled. His successor Ehud Barak was equally unsuccessful and in the impasse veteran right-winger Ariel Sharon toured the al Aqsa mosque/Temple Mount complex in what was seen as a provocative move by the Palestinians.Demonstrations soon turned into another uprising or intifada.

Coventry's Martin Cranie has sympathy for Portsmouth
Former England Under-21 player Cranie joined City in August
Coventry City defender Martin Cranie is full of sympathy for his former colleagues at Portsmouth.The full-back, 23, joined City from Pompey during the summer and has seen his old club fail to pay their players on time three times this season. Cranie told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire: "I know a few of the lads and I think they're finding it difficult as a club at the minute. "I enjoyed my time at the club and hopefully they can get out of that." Portsmouth players and staff were not paid at the end of last month although it is understood that the matter is likely to be resolved this week.
Hopefully our fans can get behind us and we can come out on top
Martin Cranie on the FA Cup replay with Pompey
Coventry took Pompey to a replay in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday. Right-footed Cranie filled in at left-back for the tie and is confident of completing the job at the Ricoh Arena. "It would be good for us to take a scalp this early in the FA Cup," he said. "It's going to be a tough game again. They're going to come up looking to win. Hopefully our fans can get behind us and we can come out on top." The winners will be at home to Sunderland in the fourth round.
