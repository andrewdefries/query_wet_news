Temple row 'to ease after polls'
The number of soldiers from both sides at the site has increased in recent days
A stand-off involving hundreds of troops at a border temple will ease after Cambodia's general election on Sunday, the Thai prime minister says.
Samak Sundaravej said his Cambodian counterpart Hun Sen was using the row to win votes, but added that talks would be easier after the polls.
Troops from both sides are camped on disputed land near Preah Vihear temple.
On Wednesday Cambodia appealed to the UN to resolve the row, after no deal was reached at bilateral talks.
The stand-off erupted after Unesco listed the temple as a Cambodian World Heritage Site, reigniting nationalist tensions on both sides.
'Easier to talk'
Speaking in Bangkok, the Thai leader linked the row to Hun Sen's general election campaign.
"Let them play - they merely want a result for the election on 27 [July]," he told reporters. Tensions driving the temple rowIn pictures: Preah Vihear
Tensions would fall after the polls, he predicted.
"They (the Cambodians) will find it easier to talk ... After the elections, I will talk," he said.
Thai troops moved into an area both sides claim more than a week ago, after Cambodian guards arrested three Thai protesters there.
Since then, both sides have increased their military presence. Several thousand troops are now reported to be in and around the temple area.
The two sides held talks earlier in the week but failed to reach agreement.
The issue will now be discussed at the UN Security Council, Thailand's ambassador to the UN said. An International Court awarded the temple to Cambodia over 40 years ago
"I have been informed that the UN has included Preah Vihear on the emergency agenda to be discussed at the Security Council meeting tomorrow," Don Pramudwinai told journalists.
Despite the diplomatic furore, the atmosphere at the temple remains calm, according to officials.
The International Court of Justice awarded Preah Vihear to Cambodia in 1962, but areas around it remain the subject of rival territorial claims.
In Thailand, opposition forces have used the Unesco listing to attack the government - which initially backed the UN move. Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama has resigned over the issue and Mr Samak has also faced calls to quit.
In Cambodia, the listing generated a wave of national pride - which, analysts say, will serve Prime Minister Hun Sen well in Sunday's polls.

Business: The Economy
Boardroom blues over 48-hour week
Many bosses feel wrong-footed by the advent of the 48-hour week
The words "Working Time Directive" have caused panic and fear to spread though the UK's business community.
Real Video: Patrick Bartlett looks at the new working time directiveThe newly created hotline at the Department of Trade and Industry has been inundated since it dawned on employers that the Working Time Directive, which enshrines the 48-hour working week, would be introduced on October 1.
While employment lawyers have thrown up their hands, saying the confusion of the directive could unleash thousands of industrial tribunals, companies fear they are not ready for the changes and will be in breach of the law.
Business outcry
The European Union directive, which could cost industry an estimated �2bn, has caused an outcry from boardrooms.
Employment Lawyer Jonathan Hearn analyses possible problems with the directive"It's a complex piece of legislation which will mean a huge amount of bureaucracy for both employers and employees," says Susan Anderson, head of employee resourcing at the Confederation of British Industry.
"It's not something we particularly wanted, but there is room for employers to retain flexibility," she added.
"Companies will have to get individuals either to sign up to contracts, or workplace agreements or collective agreements in order to cover themselves."
Ruth Lea of the Institute of Directors, said: "The DTI has to get its act together because these regulations are not up to snuff. This will put employers off taking people on."
Martin Couchman, deputy chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, said: "There will be massive costs as a result of additional holiday pay and different shift patterns."
Last week, a specialist magazine for the hotel and catering trade put the cost to that industry alone as more than �100m a year. One thing is certain. The industrial tribunals, which everyone expects to happen, will be one of the few ways to help clarify the murky areas which beset the directive.

Germany hold fire on coach
Trapattoni is tipped to take over from Ribbeck
German football chiefs will not rush into naming a replacement for Erich Ribbeck, though Giovanni Trapattoni is favourite to take over.
Following a meeting on Friday, the German Soccer Federation announced that vice-president Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder would lead the search for a new coach following the country's worst tournament showing in more than half a century.
And a German football federation spokesman said the hunt could take some time.
"The spectrum is open. We are not going to name names, neither positively nor negatively," spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach confirmed.
"The new man will be on the bench at the latest on August 16 in Hanover for our friendly against Spain."
Commitments
Former Bayern Munich and Juventus coach Trapattoni is tipped to succeed Ribbeck after Bayer Leverkusen boss Christoph Daum, an early favourite, ruled himself out of contention due to club commitments.
Trapattoni, a master tactician who recently quit as coach of Fiorentina, won the backing of Bayern Munich chairman and former national coach Franz Beckenbauer.
Lothar Matthaus, who has now retired from international soccer, is also a fan of the 61-year-old Italian.
"He's my choice," said Matthaus, adding Trapattoni would "polish up" the dented image of German soccer.
Ribbeck: paid the price of a poor Euro 2000
Another option is Jupp Heynckes, another former Bayern Munich coach who is currently working at Portugal's Benfica.
But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has already stated he is not interested in taking over from Ribbeck.
German Soccer Federation president Egidius Braun has also revealed that he will step down as planned in April 2001.
Germany open their qualifying campaign for the 2002 World Cup against Greece on September 2.

In graphics: Hajj stampede
The stoning ritual at Mina, outside Mecca, is one of the most dangerous aspects of the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Thursday's stampede, in which at least 362 people died, happened on the entrance ramp to the Jamarat Bridge as pilgrims thronged to cast stones at three pillars representing the devil.
The two-tier bridge - which allows access to the pillars on both levels - has seen many lethal stampedes in recent years.
After 251 people died in 2004, the one metre diameter cylindrical pillars were replaced by short walls. This was to improve crowd flow and allow more people to stone the pillars at one time.
A five level version of the bridge is planned and work was due to begin at the end of the 2006 Hajj. Mina is one of the key sites of the Hajj and pilgrims camp there for several nights, turning the area into a city of tents.

Soldiers in freedom of city march
The Yorkshire Regiment formed in June amid a shake-up of infantry
More than 100 soldiers have marched through the centre of York to exercise their Freedom of the City.
The Freedom of York is the highest honour the city can bestow on an individual or organisation.
Soldiers from 2nd Signal Regiment were accompanied by members of the Yorkshire Regiment, the Royal Signals Association and the Royal British Legion.
They marched with drums beating, flags flying and bayonets fixed on a route starting and ending at Duncombe Place.
The Freedom Scroll was read by City of York Council chief executive David Atkinson, before the Lord Mayor of York, Janet Hopton, reviewed the troops. The parade then marched past the Mansion House, where the Lord Mayor took the salute.

Lizo reviews the next Doctor Who
Every week our biggest Doctor Who fan Lizo will be bringing you his verdict on the week's episode of Doctor Who before it's even hit your screens!
Here's what he thought of the seventh episode from the second series: The Idiot's Lantern.
'I heard they rot your brains. Rot them into soup and your brain comes pouring out your ears, that's what television does!' So says an elderly woman in the pre-title sequence of this week's episode.
Officially, I suppose I should be offended as I've spent most of my working life involved in TV, and most of my non-working life watching it.
TV themed
Indeed, this episode is even called The Idiot's Lantern - a nickname for TV sets. Unsurprisingly then, TVs have a key role in the plot.
The Doctor and Rose land in what they hope is New York where they plan to watch legendary singer Elvis Presley perform. No such luck, it's London (again) and something strange is going on. Having a TV set in 1953 was still quite unusual, but the prospect of watching the new Queen being officially crowned meant that suddenly they began to fly off the shelves (not literally - even though this is Doctor Who).
At the same time people are being strangely altered, and the Doctor thinks that the new TV sets from one store in particular are to blame.
This is a very different episode, written by Mark Gatiss, who penned last season's Unquiet Dead. It rattles along well enough, but unfortunately doesn't have the energy that previous episodes have had. It has a slightly clumsy sub plot about equality between men and women, and a villain who's never really satisfactorily explained - I much prefer us to understand more about their background.
Fabulous effects
That said, there's some nice stuff in here. The revelation of what's happening to the victims is fabulous (hats off to the special effects wizards at The Mill). And it's good to see Rose well entwined in the nastiness that's going on.
Every series has to have its peaks and troughs though, and after the frantic excitement of the Cyberman episodes, this was always going to be a smaller, less epic adventure where the mystery was wrapped up very quickly. And many will enjoy its more intimate nature. But I'm now really looking forward to the next two-parter which Billie Piper told me was the most frightening thing they've done yet!
