South Korea awarded UAE nuclear power contract
An illustration of nuclear power plants to be built by the consortium
A South Korean consortium has been awarded a contract worth some $20bn (£12.5bn) to build four nuclear power plants in the United Arab Emirates.The group, led by the Korea Electric Power Corp (Kepco), beat bids from a US-Japanese group and a French firm. South Korean officials said the deal was the biggest single contract the country had ever won abroad. Though the world's third largest oil exporter, the UAE says only nuclear power can meet its energy demands. The nuclear reactors should all be in operation by 2020, by which time demand for electricity in the UAE is expected to have more than doubled. The first is scheduled to begin supplying power in 2017. As well as Kepco, the winning consortium includes Samsung, Hyundai and Doosan Heavy Industries, as well as US firm Westinghouse and Japan's Toshiba. The South Korean president's office described the deal as "the largest mega-project in Korean history". It also represents that first time the country has exported a nuclear power plant, according to the Associated Press news agency. South Korea first introduced atomic power in 1978 and now has 20 nuclear reactors in operation.

Business: The Economy
Jamaica's economic troubles
Holiday snaps from Jamaica
Jamaica. Lush island of heart-aching beauty, destination for honeymooners and sun-seeking tourists. A paradise. And an economic nightmare.
Beyond the high walls of all-inclusive tourist resorts, Jamaica's economy is a mess. Crime is ripe in Jamaica's capital KingstonThe riots now tearing through Jamaica's capital Kingston are bound to deliver yet another blow to its fragile economy.
Things are bad enough as they are. In the capital Kingston, uncovered manholes make sidewalks to dangerous obstacle courses.
More serious is the decay of the island's infrastructure. Leaking water mains leave many of the country's 2.63 million people without reliable supplies of drinking water, causing health problems. The roads are pot-holed, parts of the capital look more like a shanty town.
Two-industry economy
The country depends on two industries: Tourism and bauxite, deposits mined to make aluminium.
Bauxite accounts for more than half of Jamaica's exports (53%), but plummeting commodity prices have hit the industry hard.
This has caused a drop in tax revenues, just at a time as the government is struggling to service debts of $3.2bn (�2bn). The increases in fuel duties, which have triggered the riots, were seen as necessary to make up the shortfall.
Prime Minister J.P. Patterson has worked hard to cut inflation, but the economy has suffered in turnThe foreign debt burden amounts to $1,216 for every man, woman and child living in Jamaica - a sum just below half of the country's annual Gross Domestic Product per head.
The costs of inflation
For years, the country was suffering under rampant inflation - 25.6% in 1995 and 15.8% in1996.
To fight escalating prices, the government of Prime Minister P.J. Patterson implemented tight monetary and fiscal policies.
Interest rates of 40% stabilised the exchange rate and 1997 was the first year that saw inflation in single digit figures again, at 9.2%.
But it came at a high price for the island nation.
The high costs of borrowing choked economic growth. During 1996 and 1997 the economy actually shrank.
Many companies collapsed under their debts and went into receivership, were closed or downsized.
Internal debt escalated.
Money was not invested in productive sectors but was put in short-term, high-interest investments on the financial markets.
At the same time Jamaica suffered under trade liberalisation in a different part of the world.
The lowering of trade barriers in the North Atlantic Free Trade Area, the common market set up between the USA, Canada and Mexico, drew a lot of business away from the island's economy.
The riots now are a result of attempts by the government to improve the island's infrastructure. Higher fuel taxes are to finance better public transport. The rioters are not willing to pay.
Tourism worries
It is of little surprise that the economic hardship has boosted two unwelcome industries - crime and the drugs trade.
Even more worrying is the fact that these two are now threatening Jamaica's other mainstay, tourism.
Nearly two million people visit the island every year, earning it 45% of its foreign exchange and providing one in every four jobs.
This is the backyard of a tourist's s paradiseBut the tourism boom of the 1990s has somewhat bypassed Jamaica. Other Caribbean countries see growth rates of 7% and more.
In Jamaica the number of visitors is climbing just 1-2%.
The reason is crime. The big cruise ships dropping anchor in Montego Bay are not coming as often as they used to, because tourists are tired of being harrassed by beggars, drug dealers, pimps and criminals.
Prime Minister Patterson has warned his countrymen not to "kill the goose that lays the golden egg".
The riots will do little to improve Jamaica's image as an island paradise.

Guide to the Honours
British honours are awarded on merit, for exceptional achievement or service.
Anybody can recommend a British national for an honour, which consist of life peerages, knighthoods, appointments to the Order of the British Empire and gallantry awards to servicemen and women and civilians.
The Queen chooses the recipients on the advice of the Prime Minister, to whom recommendations are sent either by government ministers or by members of the public.
Private nominations, made by individuals or by representatives of organisations to the Prime Ministers' Office, make up around a quarter of all recommendations.
Honorary awards for foreign nationals are recommended by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. A number of these orders for chivalry are made after a personal decision made by the Queen.
Life Peers
Life peerages are the only form of peerages regularly created by the Sovereign.
A life peer becomes a baron and sits in the House of Lords on conferment of peerage.
These are titles which they hold only during their lifetime and are not passed to their heirs. Knights Bachelor
The honour of knighthood comes from the days of medieval chivalry, as does the method used to confer the knighthood: the accolade, or the touch of a sword by the Sovereign.
Although Knights Bachelor do not comprise an order of chivalry, knighthood is a dignity which has its origins in Britain in Saxon times. They are styled "Sir" (except for clergymen who do not receive the accolade) and their wives "Lady".
Women receiving the honour are styled "Dame" but do not received the accolade.
The Order of the Bath The Order of the Bath is an order of chivalry and was founded in 1725 for service of the highest calibre. The order has a civil and military division and is awarded in the following ranks: Knight Grand Cross (GCB), Knight Commander (KCB) and Companion (CB). The Order takes its name from the symbolic bathing which in former times was often part of the preparation of a candidate for knighthood. Order of St Michael and St George
This Order was founded by King George III in 1818 and is awarded to British subjects who have rendered extraordinary and important services abroad or in the Commonwealth. Ranks in the Order are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCMG), Knight or Dame Commander (KCMG or DCMG) and Companion (CMG).
Order of the Companions Honour
This is awarded for service of conspicuous national importance and is limited to 65 people. Recipients wear the initials CH after their name.
Orders of the British Empire
King George V in 1917 created these honours during World War 1 to reward services to the war effort by civilians at home and servicemen in support positions. The orders are now awarded mainly to civilians and service personnel for public service or other distinctions and has a military and a civil division. Ranks in the Order are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GBE), Knight or Dame Commander (KBE or DBE), Commander (CBE), Officer (OBE) and Member (MBE).
Royal Victorian Order
By 1896, prime ministers and governments had increased their influence over the distribution of awards and had gained almost total control of the system. Therefore, Queen Victoria instituted The Royal Victorian Order as a personal award for services performed on her behalf.
Today this honour is still awarded in recognition of services to the royal family. The ranks are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCVO), Knight or Dame Commander (KCVO or DCVO), Commander (CVO), Lieutenant (LVO) and Member (MVO).
Royal Victorian Medal
Associated with the Royal Victorial Order is the Royal Victorian Medal which has three grades: gold, silver and bronze. The circular medal is attached to the ribbon of the Order.
More than one grade may be held by the same person and the medal may be worn along with the insignia of the Order itself.
Royal Red Cross
Founded in 1883 by Queen Victoria, The award is confined to the Nursing Services. Those awarded the First Class are designated "Members" (RRC): those awarded the Second Class are designated "Associates" (ARRC).
It is said that the suggestion for the founding of this decoration was made to Queen Victoria by Miss Florence Nightingale.
Queen's Police Medal
This is awarded for distinguished service to the police force.
Queen's Fire Service Medal
This honour is given to firemen who have displayed conspicuous devotion to duty.

MPs push harder for smoking ban
The government wants to ban smoking in enclosed spaces
Ministers are under renewed pressure from Labour MPs to introduce a total ban on smoking in public places.
The Health Bill, which introduces a partial ban on smoking in public places in England, has cleared its first hurdle in the House of Commons.
But ex-health secretary Frank Dobson, who dubbed the bill "half-baked and half-hearted", warned that it must be amended later to implement a total ban.
Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt says the bill strikes the right balance.
'Health gap'
Lib Dem Paul Burstow says research shows a total ban could save 200 people from dying due to passive smoking.
Ms Hewitt, who is believed to have wanted a total ban but backed down after strong opposition from her predecessor John Reid, said she believes a total ban will ultimately happen.
They aren't reading the political tea-leaves because there is a majority in this House for a complete ban
Andrew MackinlayLabour MP
Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson said last week he had considered resigning after the government ignored his advice for a total ban.
Professor Alex Markham, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said the partial ban plan showed the government was "completely out of touch with the population".
Mr Dobson said the government was knowingly widening the "health gap" between rich and poor because a partial ban was bad for working class people.
"Pubs, clubs and bars serving booze but no food are mainly located in poor neighbourhoods and serve working class people," he said.
"So this partial ban would be good for the health of middle class people but bad for the health of working class people."
'Excessive' interference
But opening the second reading debate of the bill, Ms Hewitt said: "In framing this legislation ... we are striking a balance between two extremes: an over-prescriptive state on the one hand and on the other an irresponsibly laissez-faire government.
"We are responding to the clear wish of the public on the one hand to be protected from other people's smoking in public places - particularly in restaurants - and on the other hand to allow people who want to have a cigarette with a drink to do so."
Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley accused ministers of "excessive" interference.
He said the Tories would have preferred a "self regulatory solution" to provide more smoke-free environments.
Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay said the government could face a second Commons defeat on the issue, just two weeks after it lost a crucial vote on the Terrorism Bill.
Harold Shipman
"They aren't reading the political tea-leaves because there is a majority in this House for a complete ban," he said.
The bill also sets out a range of measures to protect patients from MRSA infections, and a repeat of the Shipman murders. It also includes details of a new hygiene code for hospitals and reform of controlled drugs management.

Triplets off to different schools
Triplets set for different schools
Lots of children in England found out this week which secondary schools they'll be going to in September.
The way places are given out is very complicated, but not everyone is able to go to their first choice school.
Triplets Josh, Max and Leanne wanted to go to the same place but were given places at THREE different schools.
Max has got a place at the school they all wanted to go to most, but at the moment Leanne and Josh will trying on two other school uniforms for size.

Gavin met the kids to hear their story
Going to different schools may make things like organising family holidays more complicated, as their term dates could be slightly different.
The triplets' parents are planning to appeal against the decision, as they still want them to go to the same school.

First minister's questions
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. First Minister Alex Salmond has given his sympathy to the people of West Cumbria following the shooting dead of 12 people.He told Holyrood, during first minister's questions on 3 June 2010, that Scottish authorities had offered assistance to their Cumbrian colleagues and would continue to do so. Education was the focus of Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray's questions, as he told the chamber three out of four new teachers could not find a full time permanent job in Scotland. The first minister replied the level of unemployed teachers in Scotland was "lower than south of the border". Scottish Conservative leader Annabel Goldie said people in Kinloch Rannoch, Perthshire, were being "denied" acceptable GP out of hours cover and called on Mr Salmond to persuade Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon to intervene. The first minister defended his government's record on the NHS and said "communities in Scotland do have satisfactory out-of-hours cover". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Tavish Scott wanted to know why there was still no money available from the Scottish Investment Bank for businesses, 14 months after its creation was announced. Mr Salmond said the Scottish Investment Bank would "substantially increase" the funds available to Scottish business within this financial year. Labour's Pauline McNeil then told the first minister she would support him if he went ahead with a review of trading relations with Israel, following the death of nine activists killed when Israeli forces stormed a Gaza-bound aid flotilla. Mr Salmond said Israel's actions were "insupportable" and he said he had called for the immediate lifting of the Israeli blockade of Gaza.

Birmingham 2 - 0 Sunderland
By Saj Chowdhury
BBC Sport
Birmingham eased their Premier League relegation fears with victory over Sunderland, who slumped to their eighth defeat in nine games.The Blues took the lead just before half-time when Sebastian Larsson made the most of a defensive mix-up between Simon Mignolet and Phil Bardsley. Craig Gardner made it 2-0 with a low 20-yard drive into the bottom corner. Sunderland came closest to scoring through Stephane Sessegnon, who had a shot cleared off the line. They also created chances for Jordan Henderson and Bardsley, but once again Sunderland, who scored for the first time in four games last weekend, found it difficult to find the back of the net. That profligacy in front of goal, grouped with a string of injuries to key players and a run of bad results, means that Sunderland face a tough task to retain their top-flight status despite holding a five-point cushion on the bottom three.

The Black Cats were forced to field their youngest-ever starting XI in the Premier League - at an average age of 23 years and 311 days - as a result of the host of injuries. At the back they were missing Titus Bramble and Anton Ferdinand while midfielders Sulley Muntari and Kieran Richardson were also sidelined. With first-teamers missing, the last thing an inexperienced outfit would have wanted was to concede early, but that nearly happened in the second minute. Lee Bowyer launched the ball down the left leaving team-mate Cameron Jerome to contest possession with Michael Turner. The Blues forward easily accelerated past his marker and fired in an angled low shot that Mignolet did well to save with his feet. The Wearside club responded well and created two opportunities in the space of 30 seconds when Lee Cattermole robbed the ball from Barry Ferguson 20 yards out but saw his subsequent low effort blocked by Ben Foster. The Blues keeper was then rescued by team-mate Roger Johnson who got in the way of Stephane Sessegnon's follow-up shot. Moments later, Stephen Carr made a vital interception to prevent Sessegnon from converting Danny Welbeck's dinked ball from the right. Sunderland looked good value for at least a 0-0 scoreline at the break, but bad luck, with a sprinkle of calamity, struck the beleaguered side again. On this occasion, Foster's punt downfield was flicked on by Jerome. Larsson made a beeline for the loose ball which either Bardsley or Mignolet looked favourite to clear. However, neither did and instead looked at each other accusingly as the Swede's shot flew in. Sunderland promised much again after the break, with one-touch link-up play between Asamoah Gyan and Danny Welbeck resulting in Jordan Henderson's 18-yard curling effort which brushed the wrong side of the netting. Bardsley went even closer when his fierce deflected 25-yard drive looked goalbound until Foster dived to his right to deny the defender.

But as in the first half, Sunderland conceded again against the run of play. Substitute Alexander Hleb, who had been on the pitch for less than five minutes, danced around a couple of challenges before feeding Gardner, who looked up once before striking a powerful low shot that Mignolet could only palm into the net. Sunderland continued to launch balls into the Birmingham area but the home defence coped admirably. The closest the visitors came to scoring in the last 20 minutes was when Henderson's shot from eight yards was blocked by the boot of the impressive Johnson. The win takes the Blues to 38 points and 14th spot, above Sunderland on goal difference. Birmingham manager Alex McLeish: "The opening goal typified our character and spirit. Larsson has been instrumental and an inspiration. "Another win would take us close to where we'd like to be. But in this league you can't bank on anything." Sunderland manager Steve Bruce: "We have to try and take the positives out of today and if we play like that, we can still turn the season around and finish with a flourish. "We are in it (a relegation battle), no question about it. There are 10 teams in it and we are one of them. "The lads know we have not got enough points. We have one point from nine games and we've got to try and arrest that slump." "We've now got back-to-back home games with Wigan and Fulham so it is an opportunity to put things right. "Maybe 41 points will be enough to stay up. One win might do it. I think so." Live text and stats
