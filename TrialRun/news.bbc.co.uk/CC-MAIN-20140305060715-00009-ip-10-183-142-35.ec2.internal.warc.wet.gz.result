'Only love can put things right'
As part of a BBC series on Aids, people living with HIV from around the world tell their own stories in their own words.
Sundays at David's house are reserved for a lie-in David Poblete V�zquez is a 44-year-old Chilean sociologist living in Argentina who believes he became infected with HIV while injecting heroin in his youth. He describes how the love and support of his partner Maria Esther has enabled him to take the virus in his stride. I've been living with HIV for a little over 19 years. I've lived with Maria Esther for more than 20 years and she is the mainstay of my life. She supports me all the way - with my plans, my crazy moments, my chaotic ones. I hope that God will see his way to granting us a long time together.
Today is Tuesday and my first task of the day is to go and get my medication. It was my decision to attend a public hospital. Some days there are so many of us the service can't cope. I "signed in" then went to see my doctor. Today I realised I spoke to her using t� - an informal address. I never did that before. Today I realised there are a lot of people who know me. I expect they are surprised that I'm still alive. Others look on me as an example.
Losing a friend
Later I was walking back home and one of the things I did was take a photo of a tree which reminded me of a friend of mine, Gabriel, who used to like to stand under it when he was feeling bad. They put a note on the door of my hospital room saying "Aids" in big letters
I also noticed that the tree had really grown. It's a little pine tree but it's grown a lot. A long time ago we would chat and make plans. He rebelled against the medication, he was inconsistent with the treatment, one day on, one day off. Like so many things, it's a terrible waste.
I take between 13 and 18 pills a day. Why different amounts? Sometimes I just forget. I get very tired. Today for instance, I just couldn't hack it. I was writing stuff and I couldn't type. Sometimes, you just can't, you stiffen up.
Enjoying ironing
I'm trying to deal with it. Just doing the little things I like doing, and keeping up the friends we have. To have them around when the time comes to say goodbye. I'm always saying to them: just the right number of you to say "he wasn't such a bad person", "he was a good guy". There are a lot of people who know me. I expect they are surprised that I'm still alive. Others look on me as an example
It's so important to have the support of your family, to have their love and affection, for any sort of illness. I don't claim this is the worst illness, but to have the love and closeness of a family is absolutely vital. There's a line in a song by Victor Heredia which says "only love can put things right". I try to make Sundays special, just for Maria Esther and me. We have a lie in. We try to do things around the house: tidying up and each of us sorting out our own things. It's the day the telephone rings the least. And I set about throwing out papers. Also I iron my shirts - I find it relaxing. I enjoy ironing my own shirts. It's something of an obsession with me, ironing shirts. And as I throw out papers, I switch on the computer and have a look through items related to HIV.
Prejudice
Discrimination here in Argentina is really bad. Prejudice and discrimination, it's the same thing, they go together. And there's a lot of prejudice in Argentina: you've got HIV because you're a druggie, or a homosexual, or just because you don't follow all the rules. Prejudice and hypocrisy abound in our society, it's really bad.
The first time I was taken into hospital, it was really awful, I lost the sight of one eye, and they threw me - that is exactly the word - into a room in the coronary department. There I was, at a really critical time for my health, my life even, nobody came to clean me up, nobody brought me water, and they put a note on the door saying "Aids" in big letters.
It sometimes as if life is pushing you to the absolute limit. But I try not to get too gloomy about things that at this stage of my life endanger my spiritual wellbeing. It's a long process though.

The following comments reflect the balance of views we received:
Brother David, with god nothing is impossible. In touch with my thoughts and I'll keep on praying on you.Isei, Lautoka, Fiji island
May your life story inspire many more couples who face desperation and frustration over the fate of their life
Shiju Paul svd, Zambia
David - Continue to be a pillar of outstanding courage for millions around the world for they need models of your calibre to see through their own life. It is very inspirational how you keep yourself occupied and determined by engaging in small household responsibilities. May your life story inspire many more couples who face desperation and frustration over the fate of their life. I am sure many will rewrite the destiny of their life having listened you. Praying for you. Shiju Paul svd, Zambia
It is very upsetting...it makes me literally sad to know that the same medical personnel who have pledged to use their profession to care for people, can be so discriminating, and so cruel. They have more knowledge than the average person, and they know that HIV/AIDS can only be contracted under certain circumstances. So why must they be so harsh and HEARTLESS? These are the places and people that the sick go to for help, care and compassion. Often they are the last resort, as family and friends may desert them. Sometimes there may not be any family and friends to begin with...and when your last hope treats you like you are filthy and worthless, as if you are not human, then it is so easy to lose hope. I weep for those who are HIV positive. And I cry for this world, which is so cold and cruel. But those like David, who lift their heads and don't give up, make me smile. Hatred and prejudice are terrible, but he is correct: Only love can make things right.Donna, St. John's, Antigua
We can learn a lot from people like David
Mohammed, Muscat
What an example, it requires courage, willpower and is a continuous struggle, we can learn a lot from people like David. Mohammed A.S, Muscat, Oman
David, your courage and perseverance is an encouragement for all of us. Please keep it up and do not give up. Live your life positively and do not despair.Chanda, Lusaka, Zambia
David you've lived 19 years already and I hope God will grant you 19 more. Hang on. You are an inspiration to us. You really taught us that life can be lived to the fullest despite adversity. Joni Vatuvatu, Suva, Fiji Islands
David I know of a similar story where both partners contracted the virus, one involuntarily through a blood transfusion, the other voluntarily injected herself with the virus because she could not imagine life without her partner. I understand that love and caring go a long way in helping you fight the disease and I hope Maria is by your side forever and always. I admire your courage and I send you my best wishes. Udayan Nair, Windsor, Canada
Thank you for sharing your story and inspiring us all
Eric, Phoenix
David your message that 'only love can put things right' in the face of prejudice, discrimination and hypocrisy is one that resonates with truth. Thank you for sharing your story and inspiring us all. Eric, Phoenix, Arizona, USA
David. 19 years! Yes, indeed, you are a shining example of courage to those who do not see much purpose in life! I see no bitterness in your account, only a quiet resolve and a true understanding of the value of life. Keep going brother. Bhavana Padiyath, Fremont, California, USA
David - I wish you only the best. You sound like a courageous person, and I encourage you to enjoy your life to the fullest. Take it easy, and rest assured that complete strangers like myself support you in your struggle against this terrible scourge. Terry, Miami, Florida, USA
I read your story with great admiration. I think your survival is due to the grace and of god and your loving family. I will like to encourage you. Keep good and my thoughts and prayers are with you. Joel Stephen, Bedford, UK

Iuma will share the name with nine other babies
An American couple have won $5,000 (�3,320) for naming their newborn son after a music website.
Iuma Dylan-Lucas - born last Friday in Hutchinson, Kansas - was named after a California-based company, the Internet Underground Music Archive (Iuma), which has promised $5,000 to ten newborns who adopt its unisex name.
Iuma's father, Travis Thornhill, who plays bass for a band which promotes itself on the website, said: "My wife liked the idea because the child's grandma said this baby would bring prosperity, and this contest could be what she was talking about.
"Plus, the kid will have a cool story when he grows up."
The kid will have a cool story when he grows up
Father Travis Thornhill
Mr Thornhill said that he is keeping half of the winnings for his children's future (Iuma has an elder brother) and will use the other half to pay bills after he buys a new home.
Three other families have also claimed cash prizes for naming their babies Iuma.
Contest
Set up in 1993, the Internet Underground Music Archive calls itself a site for those chasing a dream to make it big in the music world.
It began its baby-naming competition on 1 August and plans to carry it until 1 November.
It tells parents "You love your baby. You love new music. Prove your love and devotion to both by naming your baby IUMA!" The contest stipulates that Iuma should be the birthname of the participant and anybody changing the name to Iuma is debarred. The firm has set a limit of 10 payouts.
Twins are also debarred from the contest, as only one entry per family is accepted.
The company provides parents the option of a one-off payment of $5,000 or $100 dollars of free music download per month for the child's entire life. Search BBC News Online

C4 to fund �2m in public artworks
Art is "bursting out" of museums and galleries, Channel 4 says
A �2m project run by Channel 4 is to produce major public artworks in six communities around the UK.
The six areas, which the channel will choose from people's nominations, can commission works of any kind from giant sculpture to a one-off performance.
A series of programmes will follow The Big Art Project from start to finish, with the works expected to be unveiled in autumn 2007. People can nominate their community on the website www.channel4.com/bigart.
The six areas will cover England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Jan Younghusband, Channel 4 arts commissioning editor, said: "At a time when art is bursting out of the confines of museums and galleries, we want to take a creative part in the debate about how artists can influence communities.
"With this project, we want to inspire people to create art for their communities and to regenerate public spaces with art - we want them to turn a space into a place."

Fossils belong to new great ape
By Liz Seward
The teeth have gorilla-like characteristics, say researchers
Nine fossilised teeth found in Ethiopia are from a previously unknown species of great ape, Nature journal reports.
The 10 million-year-old fossils belong to an animal that has been named Chororapithecus abyssinicus by an Ethiopian-Japanese team.
This new species could be a direct ancestor of living African great apes, say the researchers.
The finds from the Afar rift, in eastern Ethiopia, raise questions on current theories of human evolution.
The researchers say the fossils from Ethiopia probably belonged to an ape from the gorilla family. Evolutionary divide
Based on genetic evidence, gorillas and humans were thought to have split away from a common ancestor about eight million years ago.
The 10-million-year age of the fossils led the research team to suggest that the split must have happened earlier than 10.5 million years ago. If correct, molecular and DNA studies will need to be revisited.
The fossils were found at a site in eastern Ethiopia's Afar rift
The team's claims that the teeth belong to a member of the gorilla family stem from similarities with teeth of modern gorillas. They carried out cutting-edge 3D analysis of the molar tooth's structure and found that both gorillas and the new species had a unique specialisation for eating fibrous foodstuffs such as stems and leaves.
"It's a subtle distinction, but we've compared it with everything we could think of," said Dr Suwa from the University of Tokyo and a member of the research team.
"And it does show some telling signs of gorilla-like molar structure. If it's not a gorilla relative, then it's something very similar to what an early gorilla must have looked like."
Vegetarian tastes
Gorillas are unique among modern and fossil large-bodied apes in having molars that are specialised for shredding fibrous vegetation. The reason for this is that large-bodied gorillas depend on stems and leaves as an important part of their diet.
Not everyone agrees with the team's conclusions, however. Professor Peter Andrews, from London's Natural History Museum, commented: "It is stretching the evidence to base a time scale for the evolution of the great apes on this new fossil." Professor Andrews believes the structures found on the teeth could be related to the diet of the animal. He added: "These structures appear on at least three independent lineages of apes, including gorillas, and they could relate to a dietary shift rather than indicating a new genetic trait."
Fossil record
What is not in doubt is that the find itself is impressive. "The ancestry of humans is increasingly well known, but the fossil evidence for the evolution of our closest living relatives, the great apes, is almost non-existent," Professor Andrews explained. "It is really exciting therefore to find a fossil ape from this time period - about 10 million years ago - since there is only one other fossil ape known from this time, the more complete Samburupithecus."
The find also supports data that suggests Africa was the origin of both humans and modern African apes.
The teeth were discovered in a region that is about 170km (110 miles) east of Addis Ababa. In an area of the Oromiya National Regional State, there are exposed patches of sediments that are 10 to 11 million years old, putting them in the Miocene Epoch. Hence, they are known as Miocene Chorora Formation. The name of the ape is taken from the geological formation Chorora and the former name of Ethiopia, Abyssinia.

Others to he honoured include journalist Don Hale, whose tireless campaign helped secure the release of Stephen Downing, who spent 27 years in prison for a murder he did not commit.
It's an acknowledgement of our determination
Don Hale on his OBE for the Stephen Downing campaign Miss Badham, who lives in Atherstone in Warwickshire, said: "My award will be great for the zoo."
The Reverend Christian Weaver, of the Pilgrim Church in Nottingham, is already an MBE and has now been made a CBE for his services to racial equality.
He has been active in "all kinds of community organisations" across the UK since arriving from Antigua 40 years ago, and has been a Justice of the Peace for some 21 years.
He regards his greatest achievement as the mediation work he has done between ethnic minority communities and the police.
"I feel quite honoured," he said.
Military education
"But perhaps the person who deserves all this is my wife Daisy for putting up with me."
Professor Jack Spence says he was "absolutely chuffed to the nth degree" on hearing he had been named an OBE for teaching services to the Ministry of Defence.
Professor Spence, who lives in Bucknell in Shropshire, said: "I find teaching the military a great pleasure because they are mature and bright and very responsive."
An OBE for Don Hale, the former editor of Derbyshire's Matlock Mercury, is his second major success of the year, after helping secure the release of Mr Downing.
Charitable postman
"When you've had an eight-year battle against two prime ministers, 12 ministers and three home secretaries, you don't really expect such an honour," he said.
"It's an acknowledgement of our determination."
Bromyard postman Keith Lane was "delighted" to be made an MBE for services to Consignia and the community - but wishes his mother could be alive to see his latest honour.
"When I came back from a garden party at Buckingham Palace, she said: 'You're not bad for seven-and-sixpence.'
Artistic memorials
"That was how much the adoption certificate cost."
He has worked for 47 years as a postman, and has also helped raise over �103,000 for the air ambulance.
A Suffolk woman who set up a company and founded a charity after the death of her stepdaughter has been made an MBE.
Harriet Frazer, from Saxmundham, wanted a headstone celebrating Sophie Behrens' life with a line from one of her poems - but was forbidden from doing so by the church authorities.
Lollipop lady
Now she runs a service advising bereaved people on such matters, and putting them in touch with skilled stonemasons.
She has also set up The Memorial Arts Charity that offers training in letter cutting.
"The headstone should be a celebration of the life of the person."
Wolverhampton's longest-serving lollipop lady, June Hartshorn, has been made an MBE for services to road safety.
She has been in the job since 1971 - and hopes to continue past retirement age.

Schools have 76,000 spare places
Cantonian pupils demonstrate at plans to close their school
Plan to close 17 schools
Cardiff schools proposal
School across Wales have nearly 76,000 surplus places, the BBC has found.
The survey comes as Cardiff Council announced 11 primaries and six secondaries could close because the city has 8,000 more places than needed.
Pupils at Cantonian High in Fairwater, which is on the closure list, staged a demonstration on Thursday.
The Cardiff proposals, which are going out to consultation, also outline plans for three new secondary schools and the expansion of some Welsh-medium schools.
Councils across Wales say they face similar problems to the capital city.
The total number of surplus places stands at 75,822.
Rhondda Cynon Taf has more than 10,000, Swansea nearly 5,000 and Wrexham over 4,000.
Details of Cardiff's proposals were leaked on Wednesday before the council officially published them on Thursday.
Fight
Chris Howard, National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) spokesman for south Wales, agreed there was a problem in Cardiff and across Wales with surplus places.
"Everybody in education concedes that," said Mr Howard.
"The eyes of Wales will be on the capital city from this point on to see the planners in Cardiff get the decision-making right.
We will fight for teachers to keep their jobs
Steve Reardon, NASUWT
"[They have to] get the process right and look after the interests of students, children, parents and their teachers and head teachers," he told BBC Radio Wales.
Potentially, more than 300 schools in Wales could close if all the surplus places were to be removed, although Welsh-medium and faith-based schooling as well as Wales' geography means the matter is more complex than simply numbers.
Steve Reardon of teaching union NASUWT warned unions would fight any compulsory redundancies if schools did close.
"In these schools that have been earmarked, there will be some blight and there will be a problem with recruitment," he said.
"As far as the NASUWT is concerned, we will look after the interests of our members and we will take a full part in the consultative process.
"As a trade union, we will not be able to accept compulsory redundancies. We believe that it's a manageable process over the period the council has in mind and we will fight for teachers to keep their jobs."
In Cardiff, Llanedeyrn, Llanrumney, Rumney, Cantonian, Mary Immaculate and St Illtyd secondary schools could all close under the proposed shake-up.
Three new secondary schools - one a Welsh-medium - will open. A Roman Catholic secondary could replace the lower school at Whitchurch High - currently the city's largest school - and a community secondary may open in Rumney.
Primary schools across the city are listed for possible closure. However, two primaries in Pontprennau, which currently has no schools, and another Welsh-medium institution in the Trowbridge area will also be built, and �300m is pledged to carry out a backlog of repairs.

Apology for football fans' delays
Fans packed in a carriage on their way back to London Rail engineers have repaired a signalling fault that caused hundreds of football fans to miss the Carling Cup final kick-off.
Network Rail apologised for "significant delays". Services finally returned to normal on Monday afternoon.
Arsenal and Chelsea fans heading to and from Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on Sunday were affected by the delays. Queues outside Cardiff Central railway station took more than four hours to clear after the match.
First Great Western said there were still minor problems late on Monday afternoon and passengers could expect delays of up to 20 minutes.
Monday's First Great Western 0715 London Paddington to Cardiff and 0955 Cardiff to London services were cancelled and other services faced delays. In addition, services from Portsmouth to Cardiff terminated at Bristol before returning.
An estimated 2,000 football fans missed the start of Sunday's Carling Cup final, eventually won 2-1 by Chelsea.
The match was the last Carling Cup final due to be played in Cardiff
A statement from Network Rail said engineers had worked through the night and would "continue to work throughout today to rectify the problem as quickly as possible."
Network Rail is also investigating the cause of the signalling cable fault, although appears to have ruled out vandalism. Police said the atmosphere among football fans before and after Sunday's match was largely good natured, however many complained they were not given enough information.
Many more supporters spent much of last night trying to get home after the match.

A serious electrical problem was identified at Newport on Sunday morning, just hours before thousands of supporters were due to travel on the line.
It meant that many spent up to three hours between Bristol and Cardiff, forcing them to take their seats midway through the first half.
Fans heading back to London said it had ruined what may have been the last time they visit Cardiff for a major football cup final.
Although some trains were up to 90 minutes late for the game, football officials ruled the match should still start on time.
British Transport Police said the signalling problem was caused by an isolated electrical problem in the cables at Newport. If we had known about it, we would have put arrangements in place, worked with the train operators, to make people aware a lot earlier
Ben Herbert, Network Rail
Network Rail spokesman Ben Herbert apologised for the delays, which he said had been caused by a "fairly serious" but unforeseen signalling problem.
He told BBC Radio Wales: "We can appreciate it did cause pretty major disruption for a lot of people yesterday and this morning.
"If we had known about it, we would have put arrangements in place, worked with the train operators, to make people aware a lot earlier.
"Unfortunately it is one of these things we could not have foreseen. It was very unfortunate it did coincide with that very big match at the Millennium Stadium."
The match, which ended in a 2-1 victory for Chelsea, was the seventh Carling Cup final to have been held in south Wales during the rebuilding of English football's traditional home, Wembley, in north London.
Football's showpiece games are due to return to Wembley, beginning with the FA Cup Final in May.

Lonergan signs new Preston deal
Lonergan is a former England Under-21 international
Preston keeper Andy Lonergan has signed a three-and-half-year contract extension with the club.
The new deal for the 23-year-old will run until 2011 and there is also the option of a further year. "He has shown what a quality keeper he is and is pushing Carlo Nash very close for a starting place," Preston boss Paul Simpson told the club's website.
"We all know it has been a frustrating couple of seasons for him with injury but he just has to be patient now."
