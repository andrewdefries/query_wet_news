Obama shelves Europe missile plan
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Barack Obama: "I'm confident... we have strengthened America's national security"
US President Barack Obama has shelved plans for controversial bases in Poland and the Czech Republic in a major overhaul of missile defence in Europe.The bases are to be scrapped after a review of the threat from Iran. Mr Obama said there would be a "proven, cost-effective" system using land- and sea-based interceptors against Iran's short- and medium-range missile threat. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has welcomed the US decision, calling it a "responsible move". Russia had always seen the shield as a threat. However, there has been criticism of the decision in conservative circles in the US. The US signed a deal in August 2008 with Poland to site 10 interceptors at a base near the Baltic Sea, and with the Czech Republic to build a radar station on its territory. ANALYSIS
Kevin Connolly, BBC News, Washington
It would be hard to invent a news story that tied together more strategic and political issues than the Obama administration's decision to change its stance on the deployment of a missile defence shield in Eastern Europe.It touches on Washington's assessment of Iran's military capabilities. There is an underlying assumption that Tehran's capacity for mounting warheads on long-range missiles does not pose an immediate strategic headache.It also sends a signal to the peoples of Central Europe about how President Barack Obama proposes to manage the post Cold War order in their neck of the woods in the next few years. And it raises questions about the administration's much-talked-about desire to "hit the reset" button on its relationship with Russia.
Will overhaul benefit US?
The US had said the missile shield would be fully operational by 2012. But President Obama this year ordered a review of the defence system, which was strongly backed by his predecessor George W Bush. 'Stronger and smarter'On Thursday, President Obama said in a live TV address that the change was needed to "deploy a defence system that best responds to the threats we face". He said a review had shown the need to switch strategy to defending against the short- and medium-range missiles that Iran could use to target Europe. Twice Mr Obama referred to the need for a system that was "proven and cost effective". He said the new approach would provide "a stronger, smarter and swifter defence" of US and allied forces in Europe. Mr Obama said he had spoken to both the Czech Republic and Poland and stressed his commitments to their defence. But he said again that Russia's concerns about the old system were "entirely unfounded". It is a concession to the Russians with absolutely nothing in return

Polish hopes shot down by US move
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs later stressed the overhaul was "not about Russia". Although the White House said the US "no longer planned to move forward" with the old shield scheme for Poland and the Czech Republic, Defence Secretary Robert Gates stressed the US was not abandoning missile defence of Europe. He said negotiations were under way with both nations about deploying upgraded SM-3 interceptors from 2015. The first phase of the new strategy, he said, would be to deploy "current and proven missile defence systems in the next two years", including the sea-based Aegis and the current SM-3. Iran says its missile development programme is solely for scientific, surveillance or defensive purposes, but there are concerns in the West and among Iran's neighbours that the rockets could be used to carry nuclear weapons. 'Responsible'Mr Medvedev said the US decision was a "positive" one. He said he would discuss the missile defence issue with President Obama during a visit to the United Nations in New York next week. Mr Medvedev said in a TV address: "We value the US president's responsible approach towards implementing our agreements. I am ready to continue the dialogue." The two countries are currently in talks about reducing their nuclear weapons stockpiles, and the US move could influence Russia to be more co-operative, correspondents say. Mr Medvedev said there were now "good conditions" for talks on missile reduction. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Gates on missile shield overhaul
However, there has already been some criticism in the US. John Bolton, who was undersecretary of state for arms control and international security under President Bush, said the move was "unambiguously a bad decision". He said: "This gives away an important defensive mechanism against threats from countries like Iran and other rogue states, not only for the US but for Europe as well. "It is a concession to the Russians with absolutely nothing in return." Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the US move was "a positive step", Associated Press reported.

UN hits back over Israeli charges
Rocket or stretcher? Israel does not seem so sure any more
The UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees has denied Israel's claim that it has detained 13 of its staff in Gaza on suspicion of links to terrorism.
Spokesman Paul McCann accused Israel of deliberately muddying the waters after retracting an accusation that a UN ambulance was used by militants. He said a member of the Gaza staff had been in detention for two years, but knew of no-one else in Israeli custody.
Israeli General Yisrael Ziv first referred to the detentions on Tuesday. "We have in our hands a list of 13 detainees who are to be indicted, they are UN people with suspected links to terrorism," the general told a news conference.
It seems to be part of a background of false allegations made against us
Unrwa spokesman Paul McCann
Army spokesman Capt Jacob Dalal later said the words had been taken out of context and detentions had in fact occurred during the last four years.
Some of the 13 detainees may not actually be in custody now, Capt Dalal said.
"It seems to be part of a background of false allegations made against us in order to muddy the waters," Mr McCann told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa) says 24 of its Palestinian staff have been detained in the West Bank, but says Israel has repeatedly failed to explain why they were being held.
A UN team sent by Secretary General Kofi Annan has arrived in Israel to examine what the authorities there say is evidence that Unrwa staff are linked to terrorist organisations. Impartiality questioned
Mr McCann pointed out that Gen Ziv's news conference was "actually held so the Israeli military could admit that they were not sure" about an earlier claim to have video footage of a rocket being
loaded onto a UN ambulance in Gaza.
"They effectively backed down and accepted our claim that it was a stretcher," Mr McCann said.
When he was asked about whether the object filmed was a rocket or a stretcher, Gen Ziv said: "I suggest we don't deal with the object but rather with the context." Peter Hansen has been the focus of Israeli ire before
He said that, regardless of what the filmed object actually was, UN employees "are exploiting the organisation's vehicles in order to support terror-related activities."
Unrwa has strenuously denied the charge. "We insist people follow the rules and the regulations of impartial United Nations civil servants and the vast majority of them are extremely proud to be UN staff working on behalf of their community," Paul McCann told Today. The controversy follows closely on the heels of a storm over Unrwa chief Peter Hansen's admission that some of his staff may by members of the Islamic Resistance Movement, better known as Hamas. Mr McCann told Today: "We cannot police people's sympathies but we can police their behaviour and activities." Unrwa was formed to relief the Palestinian refugee crisis that followed the establishment of Israel in 1948.
It currently provides regular food aid to about 1.5m Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It also runs schools and clinics, and provides shelter for thousands of Palestinians made homeless by Israel's house demolition policy. E-mail this to a friend

Q&A: Europe's ice mission
Evidence is growing that global warming is causing sea ice in the Arctic Ocean to retreat. Cryosat will fill in the data gaps
Climate predictions suggest the thin crust of sea ice around the North Pole could disappear entirely by the end of the century, at least in summer.
But the picture is by no means complete.
Our science reporter Helen Briggs looks at Europe's Cryosat-2 space mission, which aims to build a comprehensive picture of how the Earth's ice surfaces are changing.
Click here to see a graphic of the satellite
What will the mission do?
Although satellites have provided dramatic images from space, large areas remain uncharted, particularly at the centre of the poles and at the edge of the great ice sheets.
Europe's Cryosat-1 spacecraft was the first satellite designed specifically to measure the volume of sea ice over the Arctic and to map the ice sheets in unprecedented detail.
Cryosat-2 has the same mission goals:
To build a detailed picture of the trends and natural variability in Arctic sea ice, so that scientists can examine the role of the atmosphere, ocean and winds in redistributing ice in the Arctic Ocean from year to year.
To observe in detail the trend in thinning of the great ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland.
How does it work?
Cryosat uses an instrument known as a radar altimeter. In simple terms, it bounces a radar pulse off the ground, and studies the echoes. The device will measure the difference in height between the floes of sea ice and the surrounding ocean, and, on land, the elevation of ice sheets. The thickness and mass of the ice can then be calculated from the known densities of ice and seawater. What data will it provide?
Cryosat will provide data on the ice that covers the Arctic Ocean and the ice that covers the landmasses of Greenland and Antarctica. It will provide a 3D map of the world's ice caps and details of the thickness of the ice. Studying how the ice changes over the course of the three-year mission should give a picture of how the ice ebbs and flows from season to season and from year to year.
Why is the data needed?
Our understanding of the planet's ice fields comes from four main sources: military submarines, field studies, satellite data and climate models.
Military submarines patrolling under the ice during the Cold War provide historical records of ice thickness. But the declassified information available covers only a small fraction of the Arctic Ocean.
Hundreds of scientists visit the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets each year to carry out field studies. But the sheer size of these regions, and their extreme weather and geology, makes it difficult to study them in detail.
Data from the US space agency (Nasa) and European Space Agency (Esa) satellites (Envisat, ERS) gives the most accurate record of changes in ice cover. But the orbits of these satellites, which are designed to study the whole of the planet, leave vast areas uncharted, in particular the nine degrees of latitude nearest the poles. Historical records suggest that this sector may be subject to the greatest thinning.
Climate models predict what may happen to ice as the planet warms. These rely on a number of assumptions - if ice melts, the ocean will become warmer, as there will be less ice to reflect radiation back into space. Scientists need hard data to feed into the models to firm up their predictions.
Cryosat has been developed to fill in some of the gaps in the data. It will do this in a number of ways:
its orbit provides better coverage of the poles
it has a double antenna designed to determine the direction of echoes from the margins of ice sheets that have a complex topography and are changing rapidly
the resolution of Cryosat's radar altimeter is 10 times better than that on ERS or Envisat: it has a resolution of 1 km rather than 10km.
What next?
Cryosat-1 was the first of Esa's six Earth Explorer missions, a series of fast, relatively low-cost (100m-euro) Earth observing satellites.
The second Cryosat mission is expected to be launched in March 2009.
KEY CRYOSAT INSTRUMENTS
1 Heat-radiating panel - The path of Cryosat's orbit means it will face extremes of heat and cold. The panel ensures the electronics are kept at an optimum working temperature
2 Star trackers - To get the best out of its radar system, Cryosat must know precisely how it is orientated in the sky and uses three star trackers to get the necessary references
3 Radar antennas - Cryosat's radar altimeter system sends multiple pulses to Earth, and then captures the echoes to determine the heights and angles of ice surfaces
4 "Doris" antenna - The device is a radio receiver that will help work out the precise position in the sky of Cryosat to within a few centimetres. It works off a network of ground beacons
5 Laser retro-reflector - Cryosat's position can also be determined by firing short laser bursts at it and timing the reflections. Both systems are necessary to make sense of the radar data
6 X-band data antenna - This transmits the huge volume of data gathered by the radar system. The data is picked up at the Kiruna receiving station in Sweden
7 S-band telecommand antenna - Engineers also need to speak to Cryosat. Commands can be uploaded. The antenna also transmits status and monitoring information
8 Unlike many spacecraft, which have solar wings, Cryosat has a series of solar panels along its back
