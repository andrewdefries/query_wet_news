Aborigine makes splash in surfing
By Phil Mercer
BBC News, Sydney
Dale Richards said he hoped to inspire other Aboriginal youngsters
A teenage surfer from Queensland has become the first Aboriginal Australian to qualify for the main round of a world championship tour event.
Dale Richards, 19, qualified for the Quicksilver Pro on the Gold Coast, though he was beaten at the weekend.
The young surfer now wants to become the first indigenous world champion. He said he felt "very privileged and proud" to be the first Aboriginal Australian to make it into surfing's big league.
Dale Richards had been competing in the opening event of the new World Championship Tour season at Snapper Rocks on Queensland's Gold Coast near Brisbane. He was rubbing shoulders with some of the biggest names in the sport. His fairytale run on the Gold Coast came to an end with defeat against the American Kelly Slater, who has won the world championship eight times. Sporting pride
The 19-year-old Australian said he hoped his adventure among surfing's elite would inspire other young Aborigines. Indigenous athletes have excelled in many other sports, most notably boxing, rugby and Australian Rules Football. There have been other talented Aboriginal surfers, but none has earned the right to take on the best in the business. Seasoned observers believe that Dale Richards has a special ability to make difficult manoeuvres look simple. Add to that his passion and dedication and it is easy to see why the teenager is expected to achieve great things in the years ahead. Australia's Aborigines are by far the most disadvantaged group in the country. Success in the sporting arena has become a source of immense pride for the indigenous community.

Harris in drinking club fight
Richard Harris: Regular customer at the Green Room
Actor Richard Harris is backing a battle to save a London drinking club frequented by West End performers from closure.
The Green Room club, in a basement close to the Strand in central London, is under threat because the building's owners want to redevelop it.
But Harris - famed for his hellraising reputation as well as films like Camelot and A Man Called Horse - has joined the campaign to save the club.
He told industry weekly The Stage: "I would hate to see the Green Room go. I love it there because it is totally devoid of luvvies and darlings.
"You can go there anonymously, have a pint, have a chat with your friends and remain unmolested.
"It is full of technicians and actors struggling to get a job - people who are far more interesting."
The club's lease expired in 1996, but it is awaiting a court judgement over a claim it has a protected tenancy, which would allow it to remain at its home in Adam Street indefinitely.
The club was founded in 1877, but moved to Adam Street in 1955.
President Johnny Dennis said: "It encompasses the whole profession from people like Richard Harris and Lord Attenborough to struggling actors and technicians.
"It's only a humble dwelling in a 200-year-old cellar. It resembles Fagin's kitchen with water dripping in from above, but it has a unique charm. It's a home away from the pressures of work."
Comedy actor Brian Murphy and writer Barry Cryer have also backed the campaign to keep the Green Room open.
Central London county court is expected to rule on the club's future in the next two to three weeks.

Press concerned at UK Euro decision
Blair spotlighted over euro debate
European papers see the UK's decision to buy time on the euro poll as a reflection of the political dilemma facing Prime Minister Tony Blair. Some commentators feel that the British will be carrying the pound in their pockets for some time to come. One of Germany's leading dailies considers Europe without a fully integrated Britain incomplete. And two papers note the powerful link between the British pound and the monarchy.
Time will tell if Tony Blair one day succeeds in organising a referendum on the euro, and especially winning it. In the meantime, the postponement of this date is a serious defeat for him. Because it is he himself - filled with a sense of history - who raised the stakes as high as possible by making the euro "the greatest challenge for this generation".
Le Monde - France
However many economic tests they set, Mr Blair knows that London will not be at the 'heart of Europe' while it remains outside the euro. And at the moment, it looks like a long haul.
El Pais - Spain
If Tony Blair really wants to be remembered in history books as the prime minister who led Britain into the euro zone, he will have to win a few more elections... The euro debate is mainly about politics. Der Standard - Austria
[UK Chancellor] Gordon Brown claimed that his decision was EU-positive and represented a 'black day' for all anti-Europeans. This is difficult to see. The point is rather that Tony Blair is a man who wants to avoid steering straight into a huge political defeat...Thus postponement was Mr Blair's only option.
Information - Denmark
Mr Blair and Mr Brown have won a year's grace, but sooner or later the British will find themselves heading towards a decision on whether they are to keep one of the last symbols of empire or whether they will opt for a currency that will open the doors to Europe for their economy.
El Mundo - Spain
The Brits and the euro - it's like 'Waiting for Godot'. Fear of anything new is counterbalanced by the hidden anxiety about possibly missing out. Like in 'Waiting for Godot', each person can interpret the play as he likes. So yesterday, both eurosceptics and europhiles were able to feel they had edged a little closer to the fulfilment of their dreams. Der Tagesspiegel - Germany
If Gordon Brown thinks the economic convergence between Great Britain and the euro zone is insufficient, one may wonder why, as chancellor, he has not done anything about it.
France Inter radio
In the long term, the single currency is neither conceivable nor desirable without Britain... Neither the venerable pound nor the euro deserve to be used to score points in domestic political quarrels.
Die Welt - Germany
Britain's refusal of the euro must not be seen as a defeat for Europe. The UK has played a good role as a factor of equilibrium between the Franco-German axis and the rest of the continent.
La Razon - Spain
The UK government doesn't dare set out a timetable for a referendum on joining the euro zone. It knows that the people would say 'no'. For many British people, getting rid of the pound is almost the same as getting rid of the monarchy.
Helsinki Hufvudstadsbladet - Finland
The cabinet simply could not decide otherwise when Her Majesty, whose image graces British banknotes and coins, is marking the 50th anniversary of her coronation. Let us view this verdict as the embodiment of that subtle tact which for centuries has distinguished British gentlemen and which has always facilitated, rather than hindered, the choice of the correct alternative. Now and forever more: God save the Queen!
Nezavisimaya Gazeta - Russia
BBC Monitoring, based in Caversham in southern England, selects and translates information from radio, television, press, news agencies and the Internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages.

Panorama's 'healthy' snack
Gareth Bryer
BBC Panorama
In order to illustrate how easy it is to hide sugar in seemingly healthy children's food, Panorama decided to enter the children's food market.
Panorama's debut into the children's food industry
We wanted to create our own lunchbox snack, and sell it to children and their parents. To help us through the maze of regulation, we enlisted the help of the Co-op. They have a reputation for campaigning on food labelling and quality. They agreed to help us, in order to show how some parts of the food industry make the most of the lack of regulation around food labelling. Not fit or fruity
Food regulation allowed us to show strawberries on the packaging, despite there being two per cent fruit in the mousse
After looking at what was already on sale it was decided that a strawberry mousse, with four heaped teaspoons of sugar in every 125 g pot, would illustrate our point best. If a seven year old child were to eat two of these in a day they would already have reached the maximum daily amount of sugar recommended for their age group by nutritionists. It's important to stress that our product is not unusual: You could find a mousse like this on most supermarket shelves. Food regulation allowed us to show strawberries on the packaging, despite there being two per cent fruit in the mousse. While we had to place the legal name 'strawberry mousse' on the packaging, we could hide it next to the ingredients on the side panelling. And because we had the legal name on the packaging, we could choose whatever name we wanted as our 'marketing name', which was the one the shoppers would see. Healthy qualities
Fresh from the factory - and only four teaspoons of sugar in each pot
We chose Fit and Fruity - our product was nothing of the sort, but as long as our parents didn't know that we'd be fine.
Central to the success of our mousse, was the marketing. We created a fun kids' character, based around a strawberry; then we filmed an advert which mentioned a free Frisbee with every purchase, but not much about the product itself. Now we had to put it to the test- could we exploit pester power, and convince the parents? A Co-op store in Derbyshire allowed us to put Fit and Fruity on its shelves, and conduct an experiment. A group of children and their mothers agreed to take part - unaware that Fit and Fruity was our own creation. We showed each child ten minutes of Saturday morning television - cartoons and adverts, and included our own Fit and Fruity ad. Then the mums were told to let the children lead them round the supermarket, picking the products they wanted. Unexpected competition
It's on the shelves...but will people buy it?
Just to make sure the mums were sold on its healthy qualities, we placed our mousse in the fridge display next to the yoghurts. The good thing about our mousse is that it can be stored at room temperature but we decided putting it in the fridge, as some manufacturers do, would imply freshness and vitality. Almost half the children who took part went for Fit and Fruity, not bad considering we were up against recognised brand names. The parents, who had a quick examination before putting it in their basket, were happy with the choice - seeing a pot of yoghurt packed with vitamins and calcium. What we hadn't bargained for was how Fit and Fruity caught the eye of other shoppers, who kept putting it in their baskets and trying to take it to the checkout.

Laura's moment of truth
Happy students at Peter Symonds College, Winchester
Among the A-level students who returned to school on Thursday to collect their results was Tyneside teenager Laura Spence.
Earlier this year she was at the centre of a row about Oxford University's admissions policy.
Laura Spence: Heading for Harvard
Laura, 18, was refused a place to read medicine at Magdalen College despite being predicted to score grade As in geography, biology, chemistry, English and general studies.
She then went on to win a scholarship to study biochemistry at Harvard University in the United States, and government ministers condemned the Oxford college's decision.
On Thursday, Laura arrived at Monkseaton Community High School to pick up her results.
She refused to reveal her grades, but her head teacher, Dr Paul Kelley, later said she scored five straight As - as expected.
He said Laura was one of the few students in England taking A-levels who had not had to worry on Thursday.
Questions about admissions
"Like others, she won her place through American examinations and her academic profile generally."
Laura's case had raised questions about the way university admissions were handled in the UK.
Dr Paul Kelley: "Major flaws in admissions system"
"In the US - and most other countries - universities know students' results before they grant admission, and everyone knows where they stand long before
this time in the year," he said.
"The UK system of offers, to be confirmed when results are published, often prevents universities from making valid or justifiable decisions on admission offers because they must estimate a candidate's ability and potential without the final A-level results.
"The admissions system as it stands has major flaws, including huge unnecessary pressure put on students up to August and beyond. "The recent problems in Scotland only emphasise this point.
"Meanwhile, students going to American universities from this country - and the millions like them abroad - know exactly where they are going."
Among those relieved to have passed was Manisha Solanki of Feltham, Middlesex.
Manisha Solanki: Wants to be a chartered accountant
She got a D in English Literature and an E in maths - not enough to get her into her first choice of university, but enough to secure her a place at her second choice.
The 18-year-old, who attended Longford Community School in Feltham, will now go to London Guildhall University in September to study accounting and finance.
She eventually wants to become a chartered accountant.
"I really wanted to get into university, but needed 16 points for my first choice, Kingston-upon-Thames. Even when I chose it, I thought this was too high for me," she said.
"London Guildhall wanted eight points. I only got six, but I phoned them up and they accepted me.
"I would have liked to have got two Cs, but that was just dreaming. I'm not that happy with my grades, but I'm just glad I passed, and that I'm going to university. I was scared of failing and wasting a whole two years."

Sexual jealousy was murder motive
Paul Moseley
BBC News, Norwich
Simon Everitt's body was found three weeks after he went missing
Simon Everitt's badly burned body was found in woodland at Mautby, Norfolk, on the 28th June, 2008.It took a week to confirm the identity of the remains. The 17-year-old had been tied to a tree and doused in petrol before being set on fire. He was then partially buried in a ditch. It would be almost a year before any explanation was given for his death. Three people were charged with Simon Everitt's murder and Norwich Crown Court was told his death had centred on "sexual jealousies". The teenager had been involved in a relationship with 19-year-old Fiona Statham. But so had two of his killers; 20-year-old Jonathan Clarke from Telford, Shropshire, who was 19 at the time of the murder, and 25-year-old Jimi-Lee Stewart from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Both men told the court they "hated" their victim. Lured to his deathThe third involved in the murder was 40-year-old Maria Chandler from Great Yarmouth. She was said to have been the best friend of Ms Statham, but disliked how Simon Everitt had treated her. On 6 June last year Jonathan Clarke attacked the teenager in St George's Park in Great Yarmouth. He was arrested by police but later released. The next day Clarke and Stewart came up with a plan, which Stewart later said was to meant to "terrify" their victim. Stewart told the court that he lured him to a lay-by at Corton near Lowestoft, Suffolk, where Clarke and Chandler were waiting. He said Clarke used a homemade cosh to attack the teenager, but he escaped and dialled 999 for an ambulance. But, pretending to be Simon's friend, Stewart took the phone and told the ambulance service that he did not know where they were and he would call them back. ConfessionHe said Chandler then drove towards them in a Toyota car and Clarke hit Simon with the passenger door. Simon was then made to get into the boot of the car and was driven to remote farmland at Mautby. It was there that he was forced to walk into woods on the edge of a field and tied to a tree. He was then "interrogated" by Stewart who believed his victim had slept with Ms Statham. After that, Stewart said he poured petrol all over the 17-year-old including down his throat, but told the court he was "shocked" when Clarke lit a match and set fire to their captive. Hours later, he said, the three returned to Mautby where the body was buried in a ditch. Simon was reported missing on 9 June by Ms Statham. Stewart was with Ms Statham at the time and told her that Simon had probably gone up north and that she should "move on". Days later though, he broke down and confessed to his mother that he had been involved in the murder. His mother Susan Lewis went to the police and Clarke, Stewart and Chandler were arrested on suspicion of murder. Chandler finally led police to Simon's body, almost three weeks after he had been killed. Clarke, Stewart and Chandler were charged with murder, but it would be almost a year until they would finally face justice. The three have all been found guilty of murder and will be sentenced on 26 June.

Rally backing for school sit-in
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
Parents stage school sit-in
A demonstration has been held in support of parents who have occupied two closure-threatened schools.
More than 20 parents barricaded themselves inside Wyndford Primary and St Gregory's Primary in the Maryhill area of Glasgow on Friday afternoon. The city-wide Save Our Schools Campaign held a rally outside the premises in a show of solidarity. Glasgow City Council has proposed closing or merging 13 primary schools and 12 nurseries across the city. Parent Debbie Watson is one of those occupying the school. She said: "We are fighting against the closure of our schools. "If our schools close within the Wyndford community, our community dies. The support we've been getting has been amazing. I've had about 300 texts from all over Britain and even one from Italy
Nikki Rathmill
Protestor
"It's already in a bad state as it is, but our community will fight to the bitter end to keep our schools open. "We will be here until the very end until Glasgow City Council and the Labour councillors wake up." The protest at the two schools, which back on to each other, began at 1430 BST on Friday after parents attending a balloon launch in the school grounds locked themselves inside the assembly halls. The campaigners refused police requests to leave, and said they were willing to remain in the schools over the two-week Easter holiday period, which started on Friday, if necessary. Officers have made no attempt to force the protestors out, and there have been no arrests made. Parents inside the buildings have been using the school kitchen facilities to make themselves tea and food. Occupant Nikki Rathmill, whose five-year-old son Ross attends Wyndford, said there were 11 parents and friends inside the school, with a further 11 in St Gregory's. "We are trying to save our children's education and their safety," she explained. "The support we've been getting has been amazing. I've had about 300 texts from all over Britain and even one from Italy since this started. "We're determined to stay for as long as it takes." A demonstration was held in support of the occupying parents
Under the local authority proposals, Wyndford Primary would close and pupils would be transferred to Parkview Primary. St Gregory's would also shut with pupils moving to St Mary's Primary. Some parents have claimed the plans would have a negative impact on children's education, and have suggested a better solution would be to merge Wyndford, which is non-denominational, with St Gregory's, a Roman Catholic school. A decision will be taken later this month after a consultation closed in March. Ms Rathmill said the proposals would mean her son travelling 1.4 miles to Parkview school every morning. She added: "They are saying they will give him a travel card, but he's only five and there's no way he can get on a bus himself. "This is a peaceful protest. We just want to highlight the fact that the council have taken everything away from this area." Demonstrations have previously been held outside the City Chambers and at the schools involved. The parents who have staged these school occupations have shown tremendous courage and principle
Richie Venton
Save Our Schools
Save Our Schools campaign organiser Richie Venton praised the parents for the action. "The parents who have staged these school occupations have shown tremendous courage and principle," Mr Venton said. "Parents are fighting for the future of kids across the city, and deserve a huge show of support from the rest of us, not just from the Maryhill community but beyond." A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said it held a six-week consultation exercise on its school estate strategy, which included 46 public meetings, and resulted in more than 8,000 formal responses. "These are currently being collated and councillors will receive a comprehensive report for them to make informed decisions on all the proposals at a meeting of the council on 23 April," the spokesman added.

Scientology receives local rates relief on properties
By John Sweeney
BBC Panorama
The City of London gives Scientology's headquarters rates relief
The Church of Scientology has received millions of pounds of business rates relief and tax breaks in Britain.The controversial organisation, which counts Hollywood celebrities among its high-profile members, boasts of having over 11 million square feet in property worldwide, but some ex-members call it a cult. The Church is not classed as a religion under Charity Law by the UK Charity Commission. In 1999, the Commission ruled that it did not pass the "public benefit" test required for advancing religion as a charitable purpose. But Westminster City Council classes the Church as a "non-registered charity" as it is "beneficial to the community." It gives the church mandatory 80% rates relief on its London Celebrity Centre on Leinster Gardens, saving the church £165,303 over the past 10 years. Philanthropic purposesThe law states that to be eligible for consideration, the ratepayer must be a non-profit making body and the property used for charitable, philanthropic or religious purposes, or concerned with education, social welfare, science, literature or the fine arts, or used wholly or mainly for recreation by a not-for-profit club or society. L Ron Hubbard founded the Scientology movement in the 1950s
Several UK councils where the Church of Scientology owns property have allowed the organisation to accumulate at least £1.4m in rates relief over the past decade, according to a BBC Panorama investigation. A Church website also states it received more than $32m (£20m) in 2007 in VAT rebates from British tax authorities. The City of London Corporation granted the Church's London headquarters on Queen Victoria Street mandatory 80% rates relief on the grounds that it is "a charity or other organisation established for charitable purposes" and that "the property is wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes." The centre was opened in 2006 in a lavish ceremony attended by Hollywood A-lister and leading Scientologist Tom Cruise. From 2006 until the end of the current tax year, the City of London tax break amounts to £1.3m in savings for Scientology. But other councils where the Church has buildings, such as Manchester City Council and Mid-Sussex District Council where the Church has its Saint Hill estate, charge the full commercial rate on the church's facilities. Charles Hendry took the Sussex parliamentary seat of Wealden in 2001
'Not a cult'In a High Court ruling in 1984, Judge Latey labelled the Church of Scientology a "cult", "corrupt, sinister and dangerous...out to capture people...and brainwash them." The Church's credibility in Britain was given a gesture of political support in 2005 from Tory MP Charles Hendry, who is now a climate change minister. Mr Hendry's Sussex constituency borders the church's estate at Saint Hill in East Grinstead and as a shadow minister, he told the House of Commons, "although Scientology may be very controversial undoubtedly, as human beings they do a great deal of goodcertainly as an organisation it has gone through serious hoops in terms of making sure it has the right to broadcast on television, satisfying the broadcasting commission that it isn't a cult." Mr Hendry said he was not expressing a personal opinion and that his comments were intended to represent the views of his Scientology constituents. The Church of Scientology is considered a religious organisation in America for tax purposes.

Bayern Munich 1 - 0 Lyon
By Caroline Cheese
Bayern Munich recovered from Franck Ribery's sending-off to take a slender lead in their Champions League semi-final thanks to Arjen Robben's goal.France midfielder Ribery was dismissed after 37 minutes for an ugly studs-up challenge on Lisandro Lopez. But an unadventurous Lyon side lost Jeremy Toulalan to a harsh second yellow card early in the second half. And Robben gave Bayern a deserved win when his 30-yard effort took a slight deflection to beat Hugo Lloris. It was Robben's glorious volley which had accounted for Manchester United in the previous round. That win, coupled with their form in the Bundesliga which saw them thrash Hannover 7-0 on Saturday, had made Bayern favourites ahead of the semi-final. Louis van Gaal's side dominated possession in the early stages against a defensive Lyon side set up to play on the counter, with just Lopez up front. Bastian Schweinsteiger headed wide after keeper Lloris flapped at a corner, while Ivica Olic sliced a shot high and wide when well-placed.
606: DEBATE
Can Bayern Munich finish the job in Lyon?
But a moment of madness from Ribery threatened to ruin Bayern's night. Having overrun the ball, the France midfielder, who this week was the subject of off-field controversy, lunged at Lopez, plunging his studs into the striker's ankle. Referee Roberto Rosetti immediately flashed the red card. The Allianz Arena was briefly silent before a chorus of boos rang out, but replays proved Ribery, and the Bayern fans, could have no complaints. Ribery's departure might have encouraged Lyon to play on the front foot, but even before Toulalan's second booking made it 10 men apiece, Bayern had still looked the more likely scorers. Indeed, Thomas Muller should have scored on 53 minutes when set up by marauding right-back Philipp Lahm but stumbled over the ball with only the keeper to beat. A minute later, Toulalan, already booked for tripping Robben moments earlier, flew in for a 50-50 with Schweinsteiger, winning the ball but just catching the Bayern player, who appeared to make the most of the contact. A booking looked harsh, and Toulalan showed his fury as he punched a wall on his way down the tunnel. That ended any hope that Lyon might press for a win, and it was left to Bayern to carry the attacking threat. Robben screwed a shot wide of the post before substitute Mario Gomez headed straight at the keeper from the Dutchman's cross. The breakthrough finally came on 69 minutes when Robben picked up the ball on the right, cut inside on to his left foot before unleashing a swerving shot which brushed off Muller's head before beating Lloris. The in-form winger almost scored another spectacular goal after a slaloming run infield, but Bayern had to settle for a one-goal lead ahead of the second leg at the Stade Gerlande on Tuesday. Van Gaal will be unable to call upon Ribery for that match, while Lyon will be without Toulalan, but the French side at least managed to avoid any other suspensions. Six other players were a booking away from a ban, but escaped trouble, and after a poor performance in Munich, they may also be relieved that their hopes of reaching the final are still very much alive. Bayern Munich manager Louis van Gaal: "I am very satisfied. I think that we showed Europe how strong we are, we showed that by dominating with 10 men against 11. "I did not think that we would win 1-0 with Ribery getting a red card, but we dominated. I think we created more chances when we were with 10 men against 11. "When we were then 10 against 10 I sent in (another striker) Mario Gomez to score a goal faster. We created many chances but scored one goal. That is good." Lyon coach Claude Puel: "I am not looking for excuses. We still have some chances. We did not succeed in scoring that crucial away goal. I would have preferred to have lost with an away goal. "We started well but we lost the ball too easily. In the second half we were too weak with the ball.

Wales appoint Edwards and Howley
Edwards will combine Wales with his Wasps head coach job
Wasps head coach Shaun Edwards has joined the Wales backroom staff as a defence coach on a part-time basis.
Edwards, 41, has signed a two-year contract and will join up with Wales during tournaments and tours.
Former Wales scrum-half Rob Howley has been appointed part-time assistant to coach Warren Gatland, but will switch to a full-time role in May.
Gatland said: "I'm delighted we've been able to recruit individuals with the talents and skills of Rob and Shaun."
Forwards coach Robin McBryde, kicking specialist Neil Jenkins and fitness coach and fitness guru Mark Bennett retain their positions following Wales' disappointing World Cup campaign.
"I have also been very impressed by the input of Robin and Neil and I am now satisfied I have the right team in place to go forward with confidence," added Gatland.

I think the RFU have dropped a major clanger by allowing Edwards to go to Wales

Edwards helped coach Wasps to the Heineken Cup and three Guinness Premiership titles when Gatland was in charge of the English powerhouses.
Howley played under them and scored the try that sealed an epic Heineken Cup final win over Toulouse in 2004.
The 37-year-old will split his time between Wales and Cardiff Blues, where he is currently backs coach, until May and then take up a full-time post through to the 2011 World Cup.
Gatland and Edwards have remained close friends since their Wasps days, even when former Ireland coach Gatland returned to his native New Zealand to take up a post with Waikato.
"There has been lots of speculation about the arrival of Shaun - and I have made no secret of my admiration for him as a player, a coach and a loyal friend," said Gatland.
"He is an inspirational character, and I know the squad players will get to know and respect him very quickly.
"Rob Howley is also a man with great talent and a fantastic work ethic who will give nothing but 100% to the Welsh cause. He was one of the best players I ever coached."
Edwards was offered the head coach's post with the England Saxons but declined the invitation to further his career at full international level.
The former Great Britain rugby league captain has been lauded for his pioneering defensive systems and believes he can add an extra dimension to Wales' play.
"I believe I am ready for Test rugby, while I am also delighted that I will be able to continue with my role at Wasps - which is very important to me," he said.
"I have done my homework on Wales and I have looked as far back as the seventies and studied the times when Wales have been successful.
"Basically, every time Wales came top of the defensive statistics they won the championship. That includes the Grand Slam year of 2005 when they conceded only 84 points.
"Success is built on rock-solid defence - and although we won't be championing negative rugby, we want the whole of the Welsh nation to be talking about the big hits and the aggression associated with strong defence.
"We have got a long way to go, because the statistics don't lie, but I personally believe success is achievable.
"My great, great grandfather was a Welshman - and I have played international rugby union as well as league, so I know how important the game is to the Welsh nation."
The new backroom team will put the Wales squad through their first training session in a week's time, given them just under a week to prepare for the Six Nations opener against England on 2 February.
