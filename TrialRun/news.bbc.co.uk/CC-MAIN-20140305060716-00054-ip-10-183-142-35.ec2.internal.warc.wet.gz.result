Setback for UK credit card users
The UK trading watchdog sought clarification from the courts
UK consumers using credit cards abroad should not be covered by UK payment protection rules, a court has ruled. The High Court has said Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 does not apply to overseas purchases. Under the rule, shoppers have the right to claim against the card issuer if a purchase is unsatisfactory, faulty, or the seller refuses to compensate them.
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) asked the court for an official ruling, as some lenders were refusing to pay out. The OFT has argued the rules should cover transactions made abroad or on goods purchased from overseas suppliers through the internet, over the telephone or via mail order - and not only on goods bought in the UK or from UK-based shops. WHAT IS SECTION 75?
Section 75 provides that for credit purchases with a cash price above �100 and not more than �30,000 the consumer is entitled to claim form the lender if things go wrong. For example, if the supplier breaches the contract
Its view was opposed in court by Lloyds TSB, Tesco Personal Finance and American Express. Grey area
Section 75 has become a useful safety net for British consumers, as foreign travel and online shopping have increased in popularity. But there was increasing uncertainty if the rule, which is based in UK law, applied on purchases made outside the UK's borders. This confusion meant that some lenders were not compensating consumers while others were. Some lenders said it had become too expensive to underwrite purchases in this way. The OFT said it was considering whether to appeal the ruling, which will apply not only to purchases made abroad but also from overseas suppliers, via the internet, for example. We believe credit card companies should protect their customers wherever they buy
Teresa Perchard, Citizens Advice
Citizens Advice Director of Policy Teresa Perchard said she found the court's decision "disappointing". "It means that travellers and holiday-makers buying goods and services in another country will not automatically have the same protection as those making purchases at home," she said.
"We believe credit card companies should protect their customers wherever they buy."
She advises consumers to check their terms and conditions before they purchase a credit card and to switch to those companies who have said they will provide this protection.

�91m lottery win still unclaimed
Nine European countries participate in the EuroMillions lottery
Nobody has yet claimed a share of the 100m-euro (£91m) EuroMillions jackpot won by two British tickets on Friday.Operator Camelot said that by Saturday evening there had been "no valid claims" of the UK's largest ever lottery prizes of £45,570,835.50. If one person, rather than a syndicate, owns either ticket it will also be the UK's biggest ever individual win. In May, a ticket bought in Spain broke the European lottery's record by netting a 126m euros (£110m) jackpot. "We have plenty of champagne on ice and are looking forward to welcoming the lucky ticketholders to the National Lottery millionaires' club," said a National Lottery spokeswoman.

Until now, the biggest ever single win was by former Royal Mail worker Angela Kelly, from East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, who scooped £35.4m in August 2007. She offered her congratulations to the latest millionaires "on taking my National Lottery title". "My win has enabled me to bring a great deal of happiness to my friends and family, which has in turn made me very happy," she said. "I wish the new winner the best of luck."

Mark Gardiner, of Hastings, East Sussex, shared £22,590,829 with Paul Maddison in June 1995. He said: "I'd say to the winner - enjoy yourself, do the one thing you have always wanted to do or buy, treat yourself with an impulse purchase and then take two steps back to let it all sink in." The winning numbers on Friday were 19, 43, 45, 34, 11 and the Lucky Star numbers were 5 and 9. Nine European countries participate in the EuroMillions lottery - the UK, the Irish Republic, France, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg.

Ancient city discovered in India
By Sandeep Sahu
Bhubaneswar
Eighteen stone pillars have been excavated (Pics: Sanjib Mukherjee)
Indian archaeologists say they have found remains which point to the existence of a city which flourished 2,500 years ago in eastern India.
The remains have been discovered at Sisupalgarh near Bhubaneswar, capital of the eastern state of Orissa.
Researchers say the items found during the excavation point to a highly developed urban settlement.
The population of the city could have been in the region of 20,000 to 25,000, the archaeologists claim.
The excavations include 18 stone pillars, pottery, terracotta ornaments and bangles, finger rings, ear spools and pendants made of clay.
But some historians and archaeologists in Orissa have expressed reservations about the claim of the researchers - they say it is too early to say anything about the population or periodicity of the area. 'Significance'
RK Mohanty of the department of archaeology, Deccan College, Pune, who is one of the two researchers involved in the excavations.
"The significance of this ancient city becomes clear when one bears in mind the fact that the population of classical Athens was barely 10,000," he said.
Mr Mohanty, along with Monica Smith of the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, University of California, has been carrying out limited excavations at the site every year since 2005 with the permission of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Archaeologists say it was a planned urban settlement
The latest round of excavations ended last Monday and the new discoveries have been covered with special plastic material and earth to preserve them before further digging is taken up in subsequent years.
The first excavations at the site were carried out by Prof BB Lal as far back as in 1948. On the basis of the architectural pattern and artefacts discovered during the early excavations, Prof Lal concluded that this fort city flourished between 3rd century BC and 4th century AD.
On the basis of the new findings, Ms Smith and Mr Mohanty claim that the fortified city flourished from around 5th century BC and probably lasted well after the 4th century.
"We have employed geophysical survey, systematic surface collections and selected excavations in the 4.8km perimeter of the fortified area and studied individual houses and civic as well as domestic architecture to arrive at the figure of 25,000," said Ms Smith.
"If anything, it is a conservative estimate."
'Guesswork' But some historians and archaeologists in Orissa have expressed reservations about the claim of the two researchers. "At best, it is a guesswork. Without excavating the entire area of the fortified city, it is not possible to determine its population or periodicity," said BK Rath, former director of the state archaeology department. "The actual area excavated so far is only a minuscule part of the city. How does one determine the size of the average family in a period about which very little historical literature or evidence is available?
Some historians say it's too early to say anything conclusive about the place
"Besides, the comparison with Athens is odious since it was not a fortified city like Sisupalgarh," he said.
Mr Rath, however, gives credit to Ms Smith and Mr Mohanty for having focussed attention on the problem of encroachment that is threatening to engulf a large part of the fortified city. The major portion of the land that constitutes the ancient city is in private possession making an archaeological study difficult. Besides, several urban settlements have sprung up in the vicinity of the area in the last few years owing to its proximity to the city of Bhubaneswar.
With a view to preserving this important archaeological site for future research, the ASI is now contemplating asking the state government for control over the land. Lost
"This way, we can prevent further encroachment and develop the site as a tourist attraction," said BR Mani, a senior ASI official. There is also some concern about the preservation of the material which has been found during the excavation.
Well-known historian Karuna Sagar Behera voiced serious concern over the preservation of material unearthed from the site. "Its is a shame that some gold coins and terracotta pottery found at the place during the first excavation in the late 1940s were subsequently lost," he said.
"Measures should be taken to ensure that all the material excavated are properly preserved for future research."
The project is being supported by the National Science Foundation of India, the National Geographic Society and the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, California.

Home comforts for Afghan troops
Denise Harris set up the charity after her son was killed in Afghanistan
Thousands of boxes containing treats and practical items for servicemen and women in Afghanistan are being packed up by volunteers in Somerset.The project is being co-ordinated by Denise Harris, from Shepton Mallet, who set up the charity Afghan Heroes after the death of her son, Cpl Lee Scott. The 10,000 parcels will be sent to troops on Sunday to arrive in time for Armed Forces Day on 26 June. The boxes include items such as shower gel, toothpaste, chocolate and DVDs. Ms Harris set up the charity with other bereaved mothers who say more should be done to help those who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan and also those on the front line. Ms Harris, whose 26-year-old son was killed in an explosion in Helmand Province on 10 July 2009, said: "I'm doing it for him and for his fellow brothers and sisters. "It's just to let them know that we as a nation do care - it's just a few little home comforts. "We know that they get everything they need from the MoD but a puzzle book or a Tracker bar just gives them a few minutes to forget what they're having to go through out there." Many of the goods have been donated by companies, with the rest - about £10,000 worth - being paid for through charity fundraising.

Olympic venue at Hadleigh Farm set for summer start
The venue is expected to hold around 3,000 spectators during the Olympics
Work to develop the Olympic mountain biking venue at Hadleigh Farm is set to begin later this summer.Essex County Council's cabinet member for the 2012 games, Cllr Stephen Castle, told BBC Essex they were close to being able to start the groundwork. "We have signed the final legal agreements with the Salvation Army and London 2012," he said. The historic ruins of Hadleigh Castle are tipped to become one of the iconic images of the London games in 2012. Cllr Castle said the environmental considerations to the local area, as captured by John Constable in 1839, were one of the final hurdles to cross before work began. "We are carrying out the environment impact assessments and are looking to move forward for planning permission with Castle Point District Council in the Spring of 2010," he said. "We really want to be on the ground, building the course in the summer. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "The course we are building is very much part of the environment, we are not building a huge velodrome. "We hope to leave a fantastic legacy venue for mountain biking," he added. Cllr Castle also spoke of hopes to use the Hadleigh Fire Station building as part of its Cultural Olympiad plans. ""[It would have] exhibitions, artistic performances, the possibility of hospitality and looking at the way the mountain biking industry can engage," he said. "There are lots of uses for it, very much being a part of the community and allowing people who perhaps don't consider themselves as mountain bikers to also be a part of the game."
