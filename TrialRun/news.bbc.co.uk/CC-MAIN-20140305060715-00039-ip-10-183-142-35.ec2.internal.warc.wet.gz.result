Scientists probe gender genetics
One in 3,000 babies are born with a severe malformation
A gene which in certain circumstances could lead to babies being born with malformed genitalia has been revealed by researchers.
A second copy of the WNT-4 gene, found on the human sex chromosome, appears to be a common factor linking cases such as these.
As many as 1% of all births involve some sort of malformation, although the majority are quite minor, such as undescended testes or an enlarged clitoris.
We discovered that when the amount of the gene fluctuates even slightly at any stage in the genetic blueprint, it changes the embryo from male to female
Dr Eric Vilainlead researcher However, approximately one in 3,000 will be severe, and in many cases make it difficult for doctors to even tell whether the child is male or female.
In some cases, major corrective surgery can be required.
The cause of these "ambiguous genitalia" have always been a mystery to researchers, although there have been for some time suspicions that a selection of sex genes might be involved.
Comparison
The team, from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) compared the genetic make-up of babies born with malformations to those born without.
They found that in many cases, the malformed babies had two copies of the WNT-4 instead of the normal one.
Dr Eric Vilain, who lead the research, said: "Our discovery offers insight into the genetic pathway of sex determination - what makes a man male and a woman female.
"These findings suggest that WNT-4 influences the sex determination pathway at each step of the way.
"We discovered that when the amount of the gene fluctuates even slightly at any stage in the genetic blueprint, it changes the embryo from male to female."
Prenatal diagnosis?
He believes that genetic testing could be used to improve diagnosis, perhaps before the child has even been born.
He even thinks that the defect can be "corrected" during foetal development - although this is only theoretical, and has never been attempted.
"If this proves true," he said, "we may be able to correct the defect in the womb and restore the embryo to its original male status.
"This may repair the genital malformations before the child is born."
The study was published in the American Journal of Human Genetics.

Long-hours threat to family life
By Sean Coughlan
BBC News, ATL conference in Bournemouth
"Ludicrous to say children would be damaged," said Mr Johnson The Education Secretary Alan Johnson has said it is "ludicrous" to believe that mothers going back to work could damage their children.
This follows research for the Department for Education and Skills linking long hours in childcare with increased anti-social behaviour.
Mr Johnson was addressing a teachers' conference which had heard warnings of the "institutionalisation" of children.
Work hours and full-time childcare were destroying family life, said teachers.
The research published by the DfES found that children spending more than 35 hours per week in a nursery were more likely to be "anti-social, worried and upset".
But Mr Johnson, speaking to journalists at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in Bournemouth, defended the importance of providing childcare that allowed parents to return to work.
Long-hours culture
The government is promoting the idea of "extended schools", which will provide after-school classes and a safe childcare environment for working parents.
But teachers at the conference expressed fears about the long-term impact on family life when children spent so much of their time away from the parents.
Cecily Hanlon from the Childcare and Early Development Centre in Leeds challenged the "long hours culture" that was now being experienced not only by parents, but by their young children.
The idea that somehow women going back to work are letting down their children is frankly ludicrous
Alan Johnson, Education Secretary
Childcare report Babies and toddlers were now spending 10 hours a day, five days a week in institutional childcare, she warned.
"They can spend their whole childhood in care. It's a tragedy for the child and for the family," she told the teachers' conference.
While there was rhetoric about "family-friendly jobs", the reality she said was that people were forced to be "job-friendly families".
Spending so much time away from their own family meant that children were increasingly influenced by their peer group, rather than adults, she said.
And Ms Hanlon called for more research into whether such a weakening of the links within families was contributing to more aggression among youngsters.
"It's about opportunities," says Alan Johnson
"As a society, are we going to reap the whirlwind?" she asked the conference.
Teachers, while defending the importance of childcare, also pointed to the economic reality facing many families with young children.
With the need to pay such huge mortgages, the one-income family was no longer feasible, said one teacher. As such, there was little option for parents other than to work long hours and for their children to spend even longer days in childcare.
Another speaker criticised the culture of "wrap around care" when it "should be the parents wrapping their children in their arms".
Opportunities
But the education secretary said that improving and extending childcare was an important part of giving more options to families - along with measures such as longer maternity leave, paternity leave and flexible working.
He pointed to the example of Finland where high-quality childcare from an early age was a successful part of a high-achieving education system.
"It's about giving parents opportunities so that they can combine their working lives with their family lives," said Mr Johnson.
"The idea that somehow women going back to work are letting down their children is frankly ludicrous."

Coastline's world heritage status bid
The 10-year plan aims to preserve wildlife along the coastline
The Countryside Council for Wales is launching an ambitious bid to get world heritage status for Pembrokeshire's coastline.
The initiative is a cornerstone of the organisation's 10-year plan to protect and preserve the best beauty spots in Wales.
World Heritage Status would put the Pembrokeshire coastline on a par with the Taj Mahal, Great Barrier Reef and Blaenavon Ironworks - which recently received the prestigious award.
Agri-environment schemes are encouraged under the plans
Being on the World Heritage List is as a major boost for attracting international visitors and bringing in new investment and jobs.
Assembly Environment Minister Sue Essex attended the launch of the CCW's vision for the countryside at the Welsh International Pavilion, Llanelwedd, mid Wales.
The key points of the plan are to protect Wales's national parks, other key landscapes in Wales and offer greater access to the countryside for visitors.
The council is also anxious to provide an environment for wildlife on land and sea to thrive.
CCW Chairman John Lloyd Jones said the foot-and-mouth crisis had highlighted the need for ensuring the well-being of the countryside.
We want to see improvements in 10 years which people will notice, welcome, and value
Paul Loveluck, CCW chief executive "We must improve the quality of our natural environment for other aspects of Welsh life to flourish.
"We need to acknowledge that our acts have also led to an impoverishment of the environment, a loss of character in our landscape and in the number and variety of plants and animals which share our lands and seas."
The 10-year plan also focuses on protecting and expanding Wales's deciduous woodlands, wetlands, flower meadows and heather moors.
The CCW wants to encourage the removal of invasive plants, such as rhododendrons and Japanese knotwood, which takeover from local plant species.
Details of the plans include restoring dry stone walls and hedging, which are important to birds and other wildlife.
The red squirrel population in Wales is under threat
Efforts will also be made to ensure the survival of rare species, such as the Marsh Fritillary butterfly, red squirrel, brown hare and the Snowdon and Radnor lilies.
Farmers will be encouraged to make greater use of the agri-environment scheme Tir Gofal, launched by the assembly to protect and create diverse landscapes.
Less intensive methods of farming will be promoted to prevent pollution of rivers from pesticides.
Cycle routes will be extended under the CCW vision to improve access to the countryside.
CCW chief executive Paul Loveluck added: "Our vision is set very firmly in the context of the National Assembly's Scheme for Sustainable Development. "The vision is challenging but achievable. We want to see improvements in 10 years which people will notice, welcome, and value."

Tate signs new four-year contract
Tate signed permanently for the Swans in January 2004
Swansea City defender Alan Tate has signed a new four-year contract with the club.Former Manchester United trainee Tate, 26, initially joined the Swans in 2002 on loan, helping the club to Football League survival. He returned at the end of 2003 before making his move permanent in February 2004 and has enjoyed two promotions. "To have someone like Alan signing a long-term deal...is a step in the right direction," said chairman Huw Jenkins. "We are working our way through the current squad to make sure we have commitment from our players for the next few years. "We are starting to settle things down at the club after the changes during the close season. "I think we all know about Alan's commitment and loyalty to the club and the fact he is happy living in the city, and that's nice to see."

Give your views on Tate's new contract
Vice-captain Tate was signed by former manager Brian Flynn when the Swans were struggling at the foot of League Two. He, along with Leon Britton and Kristian O'Leary, are the only survivors of that squad. Tate has enjoyed promotions from Leagues Two and One into the Championship along with a Football League Trophy win and worked under three managers since Flynn. Throughout, Tate has been a first team regular and after joining initially as a centre-back he has played mostly at right and left-back, but has also had spells in midfield as well as two appearances in goal.

Showing respect for Ireland's icons
Welcome home! The team thanks its loyal fans
By John Thorne
at Phoenix Park, Dublin
The Irish nation was determined to celebrate the return of its footballing heroes in style.
Nearly 100,000 flag-waving, cheering fans crowded into a patch of Phoenix Park in Dublin to salute the Ireland team, their manager and even every single until-now anonymous member of the travelling backroom staff. To a degree, players like Jason McAteer - whose birthday this also happened to be - and the veteran Niall Quinn, who is now hanging up his international boots, were embarrassed by the noisy, green, white and orange reception in the golden evening sunlight. Fans behaved as though Ireland had won
But they responded like the newly-inaugurated diplomats for the Irish nation that they had become in South Korea and Japan during their exciting-but-traumatic passage through the first two World Cup rounds. They acknowledged the hero worship with dignity, kind words for the fans' devotion and enough humility to endear them to the families who had trekked across the biggest public park in Europe to wait to catch a glimpse of the new national icons. If the start of their World Cup campaign had been sullied by the Roy Keane affair and the vitriol and venom that went with it, the end was in danger of being coloured by the very public row about whether or not the team should have been allowed to parade through the streets of the capital in an open-topped bus. The security and health and safety authorities said "No".
But the government reluctantly agreed, and the Phoenix Park concert-cum-welcome-home-reception became nobody's favourite substitute. 'Amazed'
But crowds of cheering Irish people - mainly youngsters, families and fanatics - stood wearing green replica shirts, waving their flags and banners as if the footballers had won the World Cup. Hero worship: Fans came from all over Ireland
Pop groups Westlife and Six - wearing the national football colours - were the top acts on the stage, but it was the appearance of the 22-man squad that the crowds waited hours for. They had arrived by chartered jumbo before being ferried by helicopter to see President Mary McAleese then bussed to the Phoenix Park stage. Manager Mick McCarthy was the most articulate, praising the Irish fans who had travelled or stayed at home for their invaluable support.
Captain Steve Staunton said he was "amazed" by the size of the reception.
Boost
Even the penalty-missers like Matt Holland were overwhelmed by the hero worship. Ireland has a knack of squeezing the maximum from any international endeavour - just remember its Eurovision monopoly a few years ago. This time its footballers have given the tiny country a remarkable boost - the economic and tourism knock-on effects are already being calculated.
And a thankful population in the capital went to extreme lengths on a balmy Irish June evening to pay their deepest respects.
