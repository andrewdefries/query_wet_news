Cubans march in favour of socialism
The Havana demonstration snaked along the seafront
Defying US pressure for democratic reforms, President Fidel Castro has led hundreds of thousands of Cubans onto the streets to back a constitutional amendment setting in stone his country's socialist system.
Surrounded by security men and other top communist leaders Mr Castro led the way along the Havana seafront and past the US diplomatic mission.
Come on, comrades! Everyone will participate in the
great march against the lies of Mr W
Cuban protester
The BBC's correspondent in Havana, Daniel Schweimler, says the protest is the latest incident in an increasingly bitter attack against Washington's policy towards Cuba. The move comes a month after dissidents on the island presented a petition, known as the Varela Project, to the National Assembly calling for greater civil liberties. On a visit to Havana in May the former US president, Jimmy Carter highlighted the petition, which most Cubans had never heard of, and added his voice to the call for greater freedom. No policy change
US President George Bush, speaking to Cuban Americans in Miami shortly afterwards, then reiterated his demand for greater democracy before Washington would consider easing its 40-year trade embargo and travel ban to the island. Our correspondent says the huge rally is Mr Castro's response to that pressure, basically saying that there will be no change because the Cuban people do not want change. Castro hopes to show that Cubans do not want change
He led a million or so flag-waving marchers along the Havana seafront, whilst schools and work places were closed for the day to enable more to gather in provincial capitals and towns across the country. He called the rally earlier in the week to back a constitutional amendment that would declare Cuba's socialist system to be "untouchable", a state of workers, organised with all, and for the good of all. Wearing his traditional olive green uniform and cap Mr Castro waved a small Cuban flag himself as the massive crowd marched towards the US mission.
"Come on, comrades! Everyone will participate in the great march against the lies of Mr W!" one man shouted into a megaphone, a reference to the US president.
Dissidents dismissed
Observers say the mobilisation was also in response to the proposed referendum, known as the Varela Project.
Schools and work places were closed to ensure a big turnout
Organisers submitted more than 11,000 signatures to Cuba's National Assembly on 10 May, demanding a referendum on civil liberties.
Our correspondent says the tone of Mr Castro's attacks against Washington has increased in bitterness - with him comparing some aspects of the US policy towards Cuba to those in Nazi Germany. And that although some of his fellow Cubans join his protests with enthusiasm, others are pressured by the authorities into attending to present a united front against increasing demands for change.

Highs and lows of Nato's Bosnia mission
As Nato hands over its peacekeeping mission in Bosnia-Hercegovina to the European Union force, the BBC's South-East Europe analyst, Gabriel Partos, looks at the peacekeepers' record over the last nine years.
The deployment of a 60,000-strong multinational contingent in Bosnia from December 1995 has remained, to this day, Nato's biggest land operation. Soldiers already in Bosnia are being given new badges
It followed three-and-a-half years of conflict - Europe's bloodiest since World War II - during which the United Nations peacekeepers, Unprofor, had neither the clear mandate nor the military hardware needed to stop the fighting. When the Dayton peace agreement put an end to the conflict, a devastated Bosnia remained divided into three ethnically largely homogenous regions. The armies of the formerly warring sides - the mainly Muslim government, the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Croats - remained heavily armed, and the peace implementation mission appeared to have many potential dangers. The Nato mission was known as the Peace Implementation Force, or I-For, later rebranded the Stabilisation Force, or S-For.
I-For's first commander, Britain's General Sir Michael Walker, was eager to stress on his arrival in Sarajevo that his units had come in response to an invitation from Bosnia's rival sides.
I-For's initial objective was to supervise the ceasefire lines and oversee the separation of forces. Much of that was accomplished without any trouble. But there was one major exception, in the pull-out of Bosnian Serb forces from parts of Sarajevo they previously controlled, which was accompanied by the wholesale destruction of property by the withdrawing forces. On that occasion, I-For looked the other way; it did not want to provoke a renewed conflict by trying to stop the mayhem. But overall, the Nato-led forces were successful in carrying out their main tasks, says Professor James Gow of London University's Kings College, the author of several works on the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
Those who were obstacles fled or eventually were picked up or went into hiding, and otherwise people began to co-operate
Professor James Gow
"The first key achievement of S-For - or in its initial form, I-For - was to secure the peace in Bosnia and Hercegovina through implementing the military parts of the Dayton agreement on separation of forces and cantonment, and going beyond that to provide a secure environment so that the elections of September 1996 could be held," he said.
"That was the strategic key point - to confirm the Dayton agreements."
Safe environment
S-For's presence has ensured that Bosnia has been at peace for nine years. Apart from ensuring the separation of forces, S-For has also overseen the gradual change-over from what was a highly militarised society divided into three armies into a peaceful country with a combined armed force of only 12,000 soldiers - two-thirds of them serving in the Muslim-Croat federation's army, and the remaining one-third in the Bosnian Serb republic. It has also contributed to creating a safe environment for many refugees to be able to return to their pre-war homes. There have been few attempts to challenge S-For's authority, and only a handful of occasions when its troops were attacked. Most of its casualties over the years have been caused by traffic accidents. The Nato operation has helped create a stable environment for local people
S-For has also performed another function - to capture war crimes suspects indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. That policing role has served three purposes, according to Professor Gow: "One is ensuring that people on the wanted list go The Hague. "Two is removing them from wherever they are, and being obstacles to the peace process. "And the third is the message that it sent because we began to see a pattern: those who were obstacles fled or eventually were picked up or went into hiding and otherwise people began to co-operate. It helped to take Dayton forward."
Initial reluctance
S-For has apprehended and transferred to The Hague more than 20 war crimes suspects. But it started its arrests in mid-1997 - 18 months after Dayton - and it had missed many valuable opportunities before then to seize some of the most prominent suspects. During that early phase, I-For commanders insisted that their mandate only allowed them to make arrests in the course of carrying out their other duties. That initial reluctance to go for the war crimes suspects was due to concern that such a move could cause serious casualties and might even lead to a flare-up in the conflict. But that policy - and continuing caution in subsequent years - has contributed to S-For's failure to capture the two leading suspects, the Bosnian Serbs' wartime leader, Radovan Karadzic, and his military commander, Gen Ratko Mladic. In spite of that failure, Professor Gow believes S-For's performance in this area is quite reasonable.
"Although I would say the record on war crimes suspects is probably about seven out of 10... there are instances, such as at least two of the three American attempts to pick up Mr Karadzic in the last year and a half which appear to be so clumsy. The shadow of missing war crimes suspects still hangs over the mission "Rolling armoured vehicles across empty valleys at four o'clock in the morning, where there's a road that goes only to one destination, isn't really the best way of going about something of that kind."
Now, as S-For hands over to the European Union's Eufor, the new mission is inheriting the task of arresting Mr Karadzic and Gen Mladic.
But it's a sign of how much has been achieved that the multinational military presence has been reduced from 60,000 nine years ago to just 7,000 today - a size Eufor is going to maintain for the time being.
Although its mission is at an end, Nato is keeping a small headquarters unit in Sarajevo and the US troops their base in Tuzla, in the north-east, with a view to helping Eufor go after war crimes suspects. Nato will also continue to help reform Bosnia's military forces, leading to their eventual integration.
Without achieving those two objectives, Bosnia cannot hope to join Nato's Partnership for Peace - let alone the alliance itself.

Peres 'resumes talks with Palestinians'
Peres says he is not yet ready to meet Arafat again
Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres has said he has resumed contacts with senior Palestinian officials, but does not yet plan to talk with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
There are only initial feelers. There are still no details, it's only the beginning
Shimon Peres
Mr Peres said Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had not put any limits on the discussions, despite the Israeli leader's insistence that there are no peace talks until Palestinians renounce violence.
The Palestinians have been identified as the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Ahmed Qurei, and the chief negotiator Saeb Erekat.
However Mr Erekat denied that he and Mr Qurei had been holding talks with Mr Peres, although he said contacts over arrests and humanitarian issues did take place on a daily basis.
Discussions
Mr Peres said the talks "have not really become serious yet. There are only initial feelers. Therefore, I am cautious about going into details. There are still no details, it's only the beginning".
It is incorrect to say that these contacts are tantamount to negotiations
Saeb Erakat
"What is missing at this point is reciprocal good will," he said.
But Mr Erekat said it was "completely not true" that such talks were under way.
"Contacts are held to discuss the arrest of persons, or to ask Israel to intervene on an issue that has to do with closures or siege and transportation of medicines or water," he said. "There are ongoing contacts in this respect. But it is incorrect to say that these contacts are tantamount to negotiations." Diplomacy
Mr Peres' announcement comes amid intense diplomatic activity.
This week, both Mr Sharon and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal held talks with US President George W Bush.
Mr Bush is expected to outline his vision for a regional peace process in a speech early next week.
And on Thursday, Mr Arafat chaired the first meeting of a new, streamlined cabinet, which he appointed at the weekend.
Meanwhile, the Israelis say that they found a large bomb today in the West Bank town of Qalqiliya, and exploded it safely. They say that the bomb was meant to be planted in Israel. Key storiesIsrael's early electionsBombs and LabourIsrael seeks US cashHamas resurgent

India violence kills nearly 500
Many on both sides still fear reprisals
Almost 500 people are now said to have been killed in the Indian state of Gujarat, as fighting between Hindus and Muslims spreads from urban to rural areas.
Further incidents of arson and looting have been reported from villages in the state, although the main cities are now said to be relatively calm.
Many in Ahmedabad are afraid to leave their homes
The army has moved into major trouble spots and the authorities have imposed curfews and restricted news broadcasts to try to defuse the situation.
Broadcasts by Pakistani TV have been banned within the state, and the Indian Star News channel was also taken off the air temporarily.
The central government has been strongly criticised for not sending in the army sooner to help bring the violence under control.
And the human rights group Amnesty International has urged law enforcement agencies to ensure equal protection to all citizens and stop the cycle of violence and retribution.
The violence erupted when Muslims set fire to a train carrying Hindu activists on Wednesday, killing 58 people.
Enraged Hindus have retaliated by going on the rampage in Muslim areas, burning many people to death in their homes.
Uneasy calm
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has appealed for calm, saying the "burning alive of people, including women and children is a blot on the country's face".
"Whatever the provocation, people should maintain peace and exercise restraint," he said in a national broadcast.
It is time for the government to assert itself. Build both a temple and a mosque to put the issue to rest
Rajiv Sinha, USA
Have your say in Talking Point: What can stop the violence?
A BBC correspondent says an uneasy calm is still in place in Ahmedabad, Gujarat's commercial capital, where more than 100 people have been killed.
Government security official Ashok Narayan told Reuters news agency that the death toll had been going up as bodies were recovered rather than because of any fresh violence.
The latest reports of arson and looting have come from rural areas in the north of the state.
A police source told Reuters that a large crowd tried to set fire to a Muslim settlement in Sabarkantha district, and three people were stabbed to death in the neighbouring Banashkantha district.
"It is now turning into a low grade communal fever that could run for weeks," the officer said.
But on the streets, some Hindus shunned the call for peace.
Graffiti on a wall on the outskirts of Ahmedabad read: "Learn from us how to burn Muslims."
Self defence groups
Gujarat's Chief Minister Narendra Modi said: "Ahmedabad is returning to normal. We believe the rest of the state will also soon recover."
But some Ahmedabad residents said they had set up self-defence groups to keep vigil at night.
Groups of young Hindus brandished sticks outside their homes and said they feared reprisal attacks from Muslims.
Nearly 100 Muslims are reported to have taken refuge inside a mosque in the Kalupur area of Ahmedabad.
"We are trying to save ourselves today but we will hit back," said one of those who had taken shelter.
The Hindus who died on the train were members of the hardline Vishwa Hindu Parashad (VHP) party, returning from a disputed holy site in the town of Ayodhya in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
Tensions between Hindus and Muslims have been building because the VHP wants to begin building a temple at Ayodhya, on the site where supporters of the VHP and other Hindu groups razed a mosque in 1992.
That triggered savage rioting throughout India in which more than 2,000 people died.

Bomb blast outside BBC
Blast outside BBC TV Centre was heard miles away
Police say a bomb which exploded outside the BBC's main news centre in London was the work of an Irish dissident group.
Alan Fry, head of Scotland Yard's Anti-Terrorist Branch, said the blast went off as bomb squad officers were trying to carry out a controlled explosion of the suspicious vehicle at 0030GMT on Sunday.
It was "clearly a big device", which contained high explosives.
He said police had received a coded warning shortly beforehand, prompting them and the BBC to evacuate the premises. One London Underground worker suffered deep cuts to his eye from flying glass.
I can only fear that we will see more attacks
Scotland Yard
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Fry said he believed dissident Irish Republican group, the Real IRA, were responsible for the attack.
The warning was received by a London hospital and an unnamed charitable trust at around 2320GMT on Saturday.
Anti-terrorist chief Alan Fry believes the Real IRA carried out the attack
It was the same codeword used when a device was planted on the railway line at Acton, west London, last year.
He said: "Bomb disposal officers from the Metropolitan Police attended the
scene within 20 minutes of the original call.
"They started to attempt to do a controlled explosion but while they were
carrying out those procedures the bomb exploded.
The incident was at White City, west London
"It has caused minimal damage to the BBC premises but it has wrecked the taxi
and there is debris over a very wide area."
Mr Fry continued: "I believe that those responsible for this explosion are
indeed a dissident Irish republican group and that is where we are commencing
this investigation."Terror campaign
He said the explosion was an escalation of the Real IRA's terror campaign on
mainland Britain.
It is believed to be the first such attack on the BBC.

Mr Fry said: "We have been predicting, since Christmas, that the mainland,

Anti-terrorist branch officers are carrying out forensic tests in the Wood Lane area of
Shepherd's Bush and the road is expected to remain sealed off to traffic on Sunday.
The BBC's Laurie Margolis was on the roof of Television Centre and saw the explosion go off.
He said: "There was an explosion and a huge bang."
The mangled wreckage of the taxi
BBC cameraman Jon Brotherton said this was the first time he had seen a bomb detonate.
"There was a huge orange fireball and a pall of smoke which, even in the night sky, was visible."
His colleague Andrew Clark was inside the BBC building when the blast happened: "The room shook. There was a loud banging. There was some panic."

A BBC spokesman said: "We evacuated the main building and put our emergency plans into action. Broadcasting on channels has remained throughout the incident."
Glass shattered
The bomb exploded just yards from the main front door of BBC Television Centre,
leaving sections of the building's metal facade hanging down.
Numerous windows were smashed in the front entrance and both the BBC sign and part of the Television Centre sign were missing.
One nearby resident reported hearing several loud bangs, one of which blew a glass lampshade off his living room wall.
Robert Fulton said: "The sky was lit up like fireworks and there were several loud bangs."
Wood Lane was cordoned off
He added that he had felt the force of the blast at his home in Uxbridge Road, which is about a quarter of a mile from the scene of the explosion.
Underground services have been severely disrupted. The Central and Metropolitan and City Underground lines were likely to be closed in the area, a police spokesman added.
TA explosion
This incident is not believed by police to be linked to an explosion two weeks ago at a nearby Territorial Army barracks which blinded a 14-year-old cadet, on 21 February. Stephen Menary's left hand was blown off by a bomb packed inside a torch at a Territorial Army base in South Africa Road, Shepherd's Bush, west London.
Anti-terrorist branch officers have already said that they have "an open mind" about who planted that bomb. Police have appealed for anyone with information to call the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789321.

Leeds Carnegie sign Semi Tadulala from Gloucester
Tadulala first interested Gloucester when he was at Wakefield Leeds Carnegie have signed Fiji winger Semi Tadulala from Gloucester on a two-year contract.The 32-year-old returns to West Yorkshire where he had spells in rugby league with Wakefield and Bradford. Tadulala said: "I am looking forward to kick starting my rugby union career at Leeds Carnegie. "I was impressed when I came up and met with [coaches] Andy Key and Neil Back. I am looking forward to running out at Headingley at the start of the season." Leeds director of rugby Andy Key told BBC Radio Leeds: "We saw some real qualities in his ability to beat people one-on-one, his physical presence and his general appreciation of when half-breaks are made and how to support that break. He can only get better in this sport... and will bring all the qualities he had from rugby league
Andy Key
"If you were to talk to his peers he has actually been performing extremely well. I think his conversion into union has been extremely good." Tadulala first came to prominence representing Fiji in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup before joining Melbourne Storm where he stayed for three seasons. He then joined Wakefield before signing for Bradford Bulls in September 2007.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. In 49 appearances for Bradford between 2008 and 2009 he scored 30 tries in addition to the 36 he scored for Wakefield between 2004 and 2008. Tadulala made his debut in rugby union with the Fiji national team against Romania last autumn which delayed his arrival at Gloucester. He only made two appearances for the Cherry and Whites, both coming in the LV= Cup.
