Mori pledges Japan 'rebirth'
Mr Mori (centre) has promised not to rock the boat
Japan's new Prime Minister, Yoshiro Mori, has given his inaugural speech to parliament, promising a nationwide revival by promoting economic recovery and reforming the education system.
But he pledged to continue the policies of his predecessor, who is fighting for his life after a stroke, and made no cabinet changes.
"I will launch this cabinet as the Japan revival cabinet," he told the lower house in a televised address, two days after being named to succeed Keizo Obuchi.
Mr Mori promised to win trust at home and abroad and said he would not delay market reforms.
I am ready to stake my life on the nation's politics
Yoshiro Mori He also vowed to pursue painful structural adjustment even as he promised to ease fears about high unemployment.
"We must not hesitate on reforms for the new era," he said. "I am ready to stake my life on the nation's politics."
He said his government aimed to make the transition from an economy dependent on massive public spending to a self-sustaining recovery.
But Mr Mori did little to flesh out those and other promises to
improve social infrastructure, implement regulatory reform and
promote information technology as the catalyst for growth.
Election calls
And the speech provided no clues on the timing of a general election, which must be held by October.
Mr Mori (left) said it was his destiny to succeed Mr Obuchi (right)
Correspondents say it is unlikely to stem speculation of an early poll to let voters give their verdict on the new leader.
The latest opinion poll, published by the Yomiuri newspaper, showed that Mr Mori's Liberal Democratic Party has climbed 10% in popularity since Keizo Obuchi became ill. Mr Obuchi suffered a stroke on Sunday and remains in a coma on a life support machine. Reports say his condition could stay the same for some time. Mr Mori, who was previously second-in-command of the Liberal Democrats, was appointed to replace Mr Obuchi as party president on Wednesday - and the LDP majority in parliament then voted him in as prime minister. In a signal of continuity, he reappointed the entire cabinet which had served under his predecessor. Search BBC News Online

25% of virgins 'ignore safe sex'
More than 26,000 people were quizzed on sex
More than a quarter of people in the UK do not use contraception when they lose their virginity, a survey has claimed.
The poll by condom makers Durex of more than 26,000 people in 26 countries puts the UK in the bottom half of the table for practising safe sex.
Greece topped the table, with 88% of first timers using contraception. The study also suggested 14% of people in the UK were under the influence of either drugs or alcohol when they first had sex.
The research also indicated teenagers were more likely to use contraception than those in their 20s, suggesting safe sex messages were working.
While nearly 80% of the 16 to 19-year-olds surveyed used contraception the first time they had sex, the figure dropped to 60% for those aged 20 to 24 and just above 50% for 25 to 34-year-olds.
This shows that we should not forget about older age groups when it comes to safe sex messages
Family Planning Association spokeswoman
People aged 65 and above are eight times less likely to have used any protection when they lost their virginity than 16 to 19-year-olds, according to the survey.
Experts suggested this was related to the lack of access to contraception 40 years ago and the fact that more people waited until they were married before having sex.
Greece topped the "safe sex" poll with 88% of virgins using contraception when they first have sex, followed by Poland with 86% and Thailand with 84%, compared with the UK on 74%.
However, that was better than the US, Australia and France which all hovered around the 60% mark.
The study indicated women were 25% more likely than men to take precautions but are more likely to feel pressured - with 28% saying they felt under pressure, compared with 15% of men.
Youngsters need to receive greater support, through comprehensive sexual education programmes involving schools, health services and society at large
Peter Roach, from the Durex Network
Almost half of women also regret their first sexual experience, compared with 32% of men, according to the survey.
It suggests the global average age to first have sex is 19.25 years.
In the UK it is 18.3 years, compared with Malaysia, which had the highest average age at 23, and Austria, with the lowest at 17.3.
A spokeswoman for the Family Planning Association said: "The figures are broadly what we would expect.
"This shows that we should not forget about older age groups when it comes to safe sex messages. "It is easy to assume that as they may have been in relationships they know what they are doing, but this is not always the case. We need to have a renewed focus on them.
"But, of course, having better sex education is essential. Some schools are very good, but this is not always the case."
Peter Roach, from the Durex Network, the company's campaign arm, agreed.
"We believe youngsters need to receive greater support, through comprehensive sexual education programmes involving schools, health services and society at large."

Move over Bollywood, here's Bhojpuri
By Amarnath Tewary in Patna
Bhojpuri cinema has an audience of 200m. (Pics: Prashant Ravi)
Bollywood is having to take a backseat as the hitherto little-known regional Bhojpuri film industry steals the show in India.
The industry, catering to 200m people who speak the Bhojpuri language - a dialect of Hindi - and live in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, is raking in cash like never before.
Sticking to home-grown Indian family melodramas and throwing in some glamorous faces and slick foreign locations for a contemporary feel, Bhojpuri films are often outperforming Bollywood biopics at the box office these days.
Take, for example, two of the Bhojpuri mega hits of 2005, Sasura Bada Paisawela (My Father-in-Law is Rich) and Daroga Babu I Love You (Dear Policeman, I Love You).
Both did more business in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh than the A-list Bollywood releases, Bunty Aur Babli, a version of Bonnie and Clyde, and Mangal Pandey - The Rising, about the 1857 Indian mutiny.
Star cast
Made on a modest budget of $65,000, Sasura Bada Paisawela took in over $3m at the box office. Daroga Babu mopped up nearly $900,000 on a similar budget.
Many Bhojpuri movies take about 10 times their costs
With a success rate of almost 100% it is not surprising that Bhojpuri cinema is wooing Bollywood players like never before.
Superstar Amitabh Bachchan, presently recovering from surgery, and star actress of yesteryear, Hema Malini, have signed up for a Bhojpuri film together.
Other actors who have appeared in or are about to appear in Bhojpuri films are Ajay Devgan, Juhi Chawla, Raj Babbar, Rati Agnihotri and starlet Nagma.
That's not all - Bollywood's top choreographer Saroj Khan is directing a Bhojpuri movie, director Tinnu Verma is remaking a Bollywood hit, Mera Gaon Mera Desh (My Village, My Country), in Bhojpuri, and Bollywood singer Udit Narayan is producing a Bhojpuri film called Kab Hoi Gauna Hamar.
The four-decade-old Bhojpuri industry is attracting foreign talent too.
Ukrainian model Tanya has already played a Russian girl in love with a Bihari boy in Firangi Dulhania (Foreign Bride). Now 24-year-old Cambridge-educated British actress Jessica Bath has signed for two Bhojpuri films.
The Bhojpuri industry is buzzing as never before - with some 30 films this year, double the number of previous years.
Good business
So what makes Bhojpuri cinema tick?
Bhojpuri cinema is like home-cooked food
Ravi Kishan, actor
For one, the film-makers have astutely targeted the Bhojpuri-speaking audience at home and abroad - a substantial expatriate population in places such as Mauritius, Fiji, Surinam and the West Indies.
With Bollywood productions increasingly targeting the urban middle and upper classes in India's cities, Bhojpuri directors have cashed in by churning out home-grown local fare.
The industry also has its own stars now - Manoj Tiwari and Ravi Kishan are the biggest male actors, while an actress from Mumbai (Bombay) Rani Chatterji - originally Sabiha Sheikh and renamed after Bollywood actress Rani Mukherjee - is the most popular actress.
Tiwari, who began as a small-town crooner, now has more than a dozen films to his name and charges as much as $90,000 per film.
Kishan charges as much. He has been quoted on an Indian website as saying Bhojpuri cinema is like "home-cooked food".
Bollywood hits are now also being dubbed into Bhojpuri
Vinod Mirani, an editor of a Bollywood trade journal, said on the same site: "Bhojpuri movies are not about Technicolor fantasies. The thrust is towards home-grown subjects. The concerns are largely to do with marriage and family. There's lot of emotions."
Clearly, the formula is working.
"Bhojpuri cinema has finally got its identity and real worth. Now its commercial success is making everybody sit up and take notice," says Raghuvansh Babu, chief of the Bihar Motion Pictures Association.
Bhojpuri movies also make eminent business sense.
"Most Bhojpuri films are made on small budget of usually $50,000 to $60,000 and usually gross 10 times their costs at the box office, which is much higher than any Bollywood hit," Bollywood trade analyst Taran Adarsh says.
Bhojpuri film-makers now claim they are pushing the envelope with themes.
Manoj Tiwari says Bhojpuri films are being made around "gender themes and even a political satire is in the works".
To exploit the industry's potential, there is also a rush now to dub 40 Bollywood hits, including films like Sholay and Deewar, into Bhojpuri.

Togwell extends loan at Port Vale
Crystal Palace midfielder Sam Togwell has extended his loan spell at Port Vale until 2 February.
The 21-year-old had made nine appearances for Vale in his initial loan spell, which expired last Monday.
"I was in and out of the team a lot at the start, but I'm a lot happier now," he told Palace's website.
"I recently had a chat with the manager (Martin Foyle), and he gave me a run of games in centre midfield, where I feel most comfortable."

Sousa makes glittering entrance
Paulo Sousa has signed a three-year deal with Swansea City
By David Dulin
New Swansea City manager Paulo Sousa certainly knows how to make an entrance.His words may not have been as bold as his more illustrious Portuguese compatriot Jose Mourinho, who stepped into the Chelsea hot-seat five years ago claiming to be "the special one". But instead he dressed to impress in a check three-piece suit with open-neck shirt and dark brown shoes - minus the socks. If anyone was in doubt as to who the new man in town was, they soon found out. And with it came Sousa's charm and charisma, to the extent that eclipsed his predecessor Roberto Martinez. While some fans are still angry over Martinez's departure to Wigan, Sousa revealed the Spaniard played a part in his decision to apply for the Swans job. Sousa spoke with Martinez after beating the Swans 1-0 back in March during his troublesome five-month reign at Queens Park Rangers - a spell he does not like to talk about. And when Wigan came calling for Martinez earlier this month, Sousa went calling to Swansea. "I talked to Roberto after the game against Swansea in London and he told me from the beginning that the chairman Huw Jenkins gave him a lot of support," the 38-year-old told BBC Sport Wales. "He said the club and the people worked a lot to give him support to get success. One of the important things for a manager is the support. "After I met Huw Jenkins last week to talk about the club - the past, the present and the future - straight away I felt involved 100%" Sousa, capped 51 times by Portugal, is Swansea's 12th manager in 14 years. The former midfielder, who graduated through the Benfica academy, played for some of the biggest clubs in Europe including Sporting Lisbon, Juventus, Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan and Parma. He was in the Juventus team that won the Champions League in 1996 before winning the trophy again the following year with Dortmund. In his playing career, he has worked under the likes of Italian World Cup-winning coach Marcelo Lippi and highly respected German coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.
The lack of money is not an issue. You don't buy success. The money will help to build philosophies, identities, ideas and vision
Paulo Sousa
Sousa's coaching break came on the international stage as he took charge of Portugal's Under-15 team while Brazil's World Cup-winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was in charge of Portugal's first team. And in 2008, he was appointed assistant to Carlos Queiroz, who had succeeded Scolari as Portugal coach. Sousa's first managerial job came at QPR last November but he parted company in April when the club claimed he divulged sensitive information. The new Swans boss insists he will use the experience he picked up from working under such big-name coaches and is not afraid to call them for advice, but will not rely on them. "These are people who in the past and in the future I can talk to and who can always help me to grow," added Sousa. "But I know what I want from me. "The important thing is to have your own convictions and own ideas because we need to be ourselves. "Of course I have learned from the past from these coaches. Their different kinds of cultures and different kind of styles of football have helped me to build my convictions, my ideas. "It's always important to speak with people like them because they have a lot of history in football. "But the most important thing is to be ourselves." Sousa believes Swansea were "one of the best teams" for playing football last season and is keen to build on last season's eighth-place finish in the Championship. And supporters will be pleased to hear that he expects to continue playing a flowing, passing style of football while trying to help the Swans progress, despite lacking the funds some of the club's rivals have. "I don't have doubts that if we keep the quality, the commitment and the will in our squad, we can always stay at this level and compete with the clubs who invest a lot of money to get promotion," said the new Swans boss. "The lack of money is not an issue. You don't buy success. The money will help to build philosophies, identities, ideas and vision. "I think this it is going to be a difficult season. You have 10 teams looking for promotion and I want to be one of those 10 teams."
