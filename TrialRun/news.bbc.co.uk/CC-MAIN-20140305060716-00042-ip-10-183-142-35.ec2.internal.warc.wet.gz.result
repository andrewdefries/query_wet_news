Thai-Burmese border set to reopen
The two sides' border has been shut since May
Burma's Foreign Minister Win Aung has said his country's border with Thailand - shut since a diplomatic row in May - will be reopened.
Win Aung made the announcement following what he described as "friendly and fruitful" talks with his Thai opposite number, Surakiart Sathirathai, and Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
Because we live in the same region, share the same culture, we don't want to see any conflict
Burmese Foreign Minister Win Aung
Win Aung gave no date for the re-opening, but said that trade would resume along the border "in a few weeks".
Burma closed its border with Thailand on 22 May after the Thai army fired shells into Burma during a battle between the Burmese army and ethnic Shan rebels.
Thailand said its forces opened fire only when the fighting spilled over the border, but Burma accused them of trying to aid the rebels.
Common ground
Win Aung said that Burma did not want conflict with Thailand "because we live in the same region, share the same culture".
Mr Surakiart said a Thai foreign ministry delegation would visit the Burmese capital, Yangon, next week to work on the details of the border agreement.
Win Aung: The border could re-open "in weeks" He said the talks with Win Aung had also focused on co-operating in the fight against illegal drugs and the repatriation of 500,000 Burmese illegally working in Thailand.
The Thai foreign minister added that his counterpart had reassured Prime Minister Thaksin that dialogue with Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was progressing.
Earlier, Win Aung told reporters: "There are people who are meeting with her. I am not the one who is meeting her but they are our people." Damaging row
The diplomatic row between Burma and Thailand sparked a flurry of protests and crippled bilateral trade.
Burmese newspapers carried a number of articles in the wake of the border clash which were seen as critical of the Thai monarchy.
In an effort to repair that damage, Win Aung had a royal audience with Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, who has been invited to pay an official visit to Burma this year.
Last month, in another bridge-building exercise, Mr Surakiart travelled to Rangoon to try to ease the tension. Afterwards he said relations between the two sides had "normalised".

New Doctor Who Matt Smith hopes series will 'thrill'
By Tim Masters
Entertainment correspondent, BBC News

BBC entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba meets the new Doctor
Note: This story may contain minor spoilers.Matt Smith's debut in the new series of Doctor Who has had its world premiere, with Smith saying he is keen to stay in the role for a long time.In The Eleventh Hour, the newly-regenerated 11th Doctor crashes the Tardis on Earth, only to find himself battling a shape-shifting alien. The movie-style premiere in Cardiff was attended by Smith and Karen Gillan, who plays feisty new companion Amy Pond. The new 13-part series will be shown on BBC One, starting on 3 April. Smith, the youngest actor to play the Timelord, said at the premiere: "To my mind it's the best part in British television and I'm fortunate to have it and I'm going to keep it." Matt Smith is the youngest actor to take on the role of the Timelord
His opening story, which has been described as "Independence Day on the village green", is a mix of comedy and scares. 'New-look tardis'Smith, 27, told the BBC: "I'm pleased it's unleashed upon the world. I really hope people enjoy it and are thrilled with it." He said his most nervous moment had been the first day of filming on a Welsh beach last July. "I'd been waiting six months and thinking about it and suddenly you're on a beach and there's a Tardis there. It doesn't quite compute," he said. "But as time continues and you get better, it ceases to become nerve-wracking and it becomes a thrill and enjoyable - and that's exactly what it is now." Smith's TV debut was in the 2006 adaptation of Philip Pullman's The Ruby in the Smoke, which starred former Doctor Who companion Billie Piper as Sally Lockhart.
He brings back genuine madness to the role of the Doctor - Matt's Doctor is bonkers
Steven Moffat
Review: Matt Smith's first story
Smith revealed he had received a "good luck" text message from Piper on Thursday shortly before the premiere. He also described his co-star Karen Gillan as the "sexiest companion that ever lived". 'Gangling and shambling'Gillan spends most of the episode in a policewoman's uniform with a short skirt. She said: "What I love about Amy is that she has this feisty, independent, strong-minded exterior but underneath it all we know that she's actually this lost soul inside because of the way she meets the Doctor." Both Smith and Gillan said they had already had a positive reaction from fans. "We've had lots of lovely letters," the actress said. Smith added: "There's one fan who compares me to a hedgehog a lot, which is puzzling, but I've not had any bizarre requests. Everyone's been very kind and generous."

As well as a new Doctor and companion, the episode also unveils a new-look Tardis interior. The new console looks like it has been constructed from items out of a junk shop, including an old typewriter, a telephone, pressure gauges and a Morse code machine. Smith has taken over the lead role from David Tennant, who played the time travelling hero for four years. The new series is also overseen by a new creative team, led by experienced TV writer Steven Moffat, as Russell T Davies has also stood down as the show's producer and chief writer. Moffat said Smith's Doctor was very different from his predecessor. "David was sort of neat and fastidious like a humming bird. Matt is gangling and shambling - he's like a terrible mess that somehow becomes elegant by magic, he said. "He brings back genuine madness to the role of the Doctor - Matt's Doctor is bonkers." Filming on the 2010 series is still under way - and due to end on Saturday. Doctor Who began in 1963, and seven actors played the Doctor before the show was dropped in 1989. After a TV movie in 1996 - starring Paul McGann - the TV series returned in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston in the lead role. Tennant took over in the same year.

Scandal threatens EU commissioners
An investigation into the European Commission's statistical bureau - Eurostat - could lead to high-level resignations in the next few weeks, reports the BBC's Tim Franks in Brussels.
Dorte Schmidt-Brown is 37 years old and on indefinite sick leave.
She had a nervous breakdown making complaints about life inside Eurostat.
You are treated a little bit like an outcast - it's not popular to complain about things Dorte Schmidt-Brown
As she explained to the BBC, in her first radio interview, this was something which people were not encouraged to do. "When you stand out from the horde, if you want to say it like that, you are of course going to run into things that is not very nice.
"And also you are a little bit treated like an outcast. It's not popular to complain about things of course. "
Ms Schmidt-Brown is very reluctant to speak about the affair. The rules say that even after staff have left the commission they are not supposed to talk to the press. But her European representative, Danish MEP Freddie Blak, is under no such constraints. "A lot of people say she was paranoid and she was sick and everything," he says. "But Dorte had rights, there was something bad, and it was a really bad management system, and after the case is coming up we can see there is a lot of irregularity and perhaps also fraud."
'Commissioners to blame'
What Dorte Schmidt-Brown saw three years ago appears to be one small part of it. They have ignored all the warning signs, and I think that's almost being complicit in a cover up
Chris Heaton HarrisConservative MEP
The allegations are that Eurostat bosses channelled hundred of thousands of euros into unofficial bank accounts, away from budgetary controls. And also that former colleagues, even family members, set up companies that were then given fat contracts from Eurostat. Concerns were sounded years ago by internal auditors, but it was only in May of this year that the Eurostat bosses were suspended from duty. Two months later, an urgent task force of inquiry was set up. The UK Conservative MEP, Chris Heaton Harris, says that European Commissioners are culpable. "I believe they have either been completely ignorant of the situation, which I think is terrible, which means a complete breakdown of communications within the commission," he says.
"Or they have ignored all the warning signs, and I think that's almost being complicit in a cover up."
Looking tough
Mr Blak says the problem goes further, and that this is about the whole culture of the commission. Pedro Solbes is the commissioner responsible for Eurostat
"It's people who are working, not for the European taxpayer, but working for themselves," he says.
"People say if you don't say anything about me I will not say anything about you. And if we don't change the system, the commission will kill themselves."
There is anger right across the European Parliament with the behaviour of the commission. Some sceptical observers here in Brussels are saying that MEPs are puffing out their chests because they face elections next year and there is nothing better than stamping your foot and looking tough. Whatever the motives, the MEPs are scowling at one commissioner in particular.
He is Pedro Solbes, the man with direct responsibility for Eurostat, and more to the point, say some MEPs, the man who is most closely identified with the euro's much vilified stability and growth pact. Mr Solbes and the rest of the commissioners began their term of office in 1999 after charges of nepotism and financial mismanagement forced the resignation of their predecessors. When they took charge they each signed a letter addressed to the president of the commission, Romano Prodi, promising that if he asked them to resign, they would. Sense of responsibility
So if it comes to it, will they?
You can have as good rules as you want, but if nobody is using them then they are worth nothing
Dorte Schmidt-Brown
"There is no shadow of a doubt in my mind, or in anyone else's mind, that if it ever were to come to that, everybody would honour their pledges," says Mr Prodi's spokesman, Reijo Kemppinen.
And that sense of responsibility is something which Dorte Schmidt Brown, the Eurostat employee now on indefinite sick leave, hopes will pervade the whole workings of the commission. "That's my hope, that I can help the people that run into problems, that they will get an easier situation than the one I have gone through," she says. "That is my biggest aim in this case because you can have as good rules as you want, [but] if nobody is using them then they are worth nothing."
On 25 September Romano Prodi will face members of the European Parliament to answer questions about the Eurostat affair. Those MEPs are already warning that it will be a deeply uncomfortable experience. E-mail this to a friend

'Heat Armageddon' in California's Death Valley
By Huw Cordey, California
This year's British summer has been officially declared the coolest in two decades. But what is it like to experience the inferno of California's Death Valley?Death Valley is the lowest, driest, hottest place in North America. And if that is not enough to persuade the die-hard sun-seekers to visit, it also has the record for the hottest July ever recorded anywhere in the world - a blistering 134F (57C). But while this may be heaven for sun gods and goddesses, not everybody appreciates the conditions.
It's like trying to breathe in a pizza oven
Skaidra Kempkowski, Death Valley National Park
For those living here year-round like Skaidra Kempkowski, the concessions manager of Death Valley National Park, thoughts of July are enough to bring on a case of phantom heatstroke. This is Skaidra's second year in the post so, trying not to smile, I ask her how long it was after arriving that she thought about a transfer. "Four months," she says breaking into a giggle. Or to put it another way, the experience of one summer. "In July and August," she explains, "you can't really do anything outside. It's like trying to breathe in a pizza oven. Just walking to the car from the house can leave you utterly drained." No escapeGetting into your car does not necessarily bring relief. Skaidra tells me that sometimes the steering wheel gets so hot she has to wear gloves just to hold it. When I arrive for the interview, I notice the bonnet of Skaidra's car is up. "Has it broken down?" I ask. "Oh no," she says. "It's to stop the desert rodents from taking shelter from the heat under the hood and then chewing through the wires."
Death Valley
Situated in California's Mojave Desert
It is the largest national park in the US and covers more than 3.3 million acres
Summer high temperatures commonly run above 120F
It was named in 1849 by a group of prospectors during the California Gold Rush
Even her house, cooled by air conditioning, is not immune from the Death Valley inferno. With ground temperatures hitting 160F (71C), the water coming out of her taps in July flows at one temperature - hot. So, just when a cold shower would seem the perfect antidote to the hellish heat, it is not an option. Skaidra's previous posting was at Everglades National Park in sub-tropical Florida, so I ask her what she misses the most. "Green," she says. It's a response that needs no further explanation. Apart from the bizarre sight of the Furnace Creek golf course (the lowest golf course in the world) and the occasional strip of mesquite, a shrub that appears oblivious to the desiccating temperatures, Death Valley is essentially brown. And this year it is even more brown than usual. The valley is well known for its vivid wild flowers which bloom for a few weeks in spring, but the failure of winter rains means these splashes of colour are very few and far between. Yet even at its most barren, its steep-sided mountains, canyons and gravel plains are startlingly beautiful. Driving through parts of Death Valley is like witnessing a scene from the beginning of the world, when the only living thing knocking about was the odd single-celled animal. Of course you do not expect to see herds of wildebeest in a desert, but this one does seem surprisingly lifeless. The park biologist tells me that this year there is even less wildlife around than normal. Her evidence comes from the absence of road-kills on her morning commute. It seems a strange barometer, but I can appreciate the challenges of looking for wildlife on foot here. I did it and still did not find much. In three weeks, I can almost count the number of different insect species I have seen on one hand. Even heat-loving reptiles like lizards and snakes are thin on the ground.
And mammals - well, leaving aside the wire-eating rodents - I have seen just two kinds. The tiny antelope ground squirrels, that race around as if their tails are on fire, and coyotes. These legendary wild dogs are one of the toughest and most adaptable mammals on the planet, but this year they might have met their match. Right now they would normally be feasting on caterpillars but caterpillars need wild flowers to eat, so no flowers, no caterpillars. This is one of the United States' most popular national parks and the onset of "heat Armageddon" does not alter that. "Americans tend to steer clear of the place in July and August," says Skaidra, "but there's plenty of Europeans - particularly British. "They like to test themselves against the hostile temperatures," she adds. Possibly - or maybe they are just escaping the British summer.

Oliver meals crusade 'needs cash'
Even Jamie Oliver struggled to get children to like meals
More government money is needed to make sure TV chef Jamie Oliver's "crusade" to improve England's school dinners does raise standards, caterers say.
Otherwise, parents will face price rises to reflect the higher cost of using fresh ingredients, the Local Authority Caterers Association said.
Mr Oliver has replaced all processed foods at Kidbrooke School in Greenwich, London, with freshly cooked meals.
He has said government funding should rise from 37p a day per pupil to 50p.
Shorter lunchtimes
Mr Oliver has described much of the processed food served to children as nutritionless "rubbish".
But LACA chairman Neil Porter said caterers were under pressures of time and limited budgets.
Some schools had cut lunchtimes to half an hour and EU law prevented guidelines compelling schools to use only local, fresh ingredients.
Mr Oliver's efforts at Kidbrooke - to be featured in the Channel 4 series Jamie's School Dinners - were not popular at first with its pupils, with canteen use actually declining after his arrival.
However, the likes of fish pie, lemon roasted herb chicken and chilli beef fajitas eventually saw children returning to school dinners.
Perhaps with someone of Jamie Oliver's profile and voice leading the crusade, at last the government will act
Neil Porter, LACA chairman
Mr Oliver recently met Education Secretary Ruth Kelly to discuss catering standards.
She has promised that guidelines on the nutritional value of processed foods such as beef burgers and sausages will be introduced into schools in England from September. Parents and the food industry are also to be consulted on standards.
Mr Porter said: "Perhaps with someone of Jamie Oliver's profile and voice leading the crusade, at last the government will act. "We hope he will combine his new found knowledge with his celebrity influence to persuade the government that it needs to significantly increase its promised investment of just �1.1m to improve school meals."
Greenwich has decided to implement similar healthy eating initiatives at all its schools.
Mr Porter said: "It is one thing developing and fine tuning a brand new school menu at one school over a period of time with the full involvement of an influential celebrity chef that ensures the commitment of council leaders, governors, heads, teachers and parents".
But most would have "no celebrity chef presence in the kitchen, no TV filming and no hype, just a radically different menu change practically overnight". Kitchen staff required more training in dealing with fresh ingredients within budget constraints, Mr Porter said.
The school dinners debate comes amid rising rates of childhood obesity.
Last week, Kidbrooke's head teacher, Trisha Jaffe, told the BBC News website: "The fact that Jamie is a gourmet chef doesn't interest the pupils. "They are interested in what they like. You have to get them used to a different kind of eating."

Sickness virus closes five wards
Wards are closed to prevent the virus spreading to new patients
Five hospital wards remain closed to new admissions in Aberdeen due to the norovirus winter vomiting bug.
NHS Grampian confirmed that four of the affected wards are at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the fifth is at Woodend Hospital.
A further two wards are partially closed at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, the trust said.
An NHS Grampian spokesman added that 37 patients and nine staff were showing symptoms of the virus.

Piden que pueblo sea cementerio
Mariusa Reyes
BBC Mundo, enviada especial a Guatemala
En un pueblo guatemalteco donde cientos de personas quedaron sepultadas bajo el lodo, los trabajadores de rescate decidieron abandonar la b�squeda de sus cad�veres, y ahora las autoridades locales est�n pidiendo que se declare a estos lugares cementerios. El pueblo de Panabaj en Santiago Atitl�n ya no existe.
Diego Esquina, alcalde de Panabaj en Santiago Atitl�n, dijo que "el pueblo ya no existe" y que est�n pidiendo que el lugar sea declarado campo santo.
"Estamos cansados y ya no sabemos d�nde excavar. Los cad�veres est�n tan descompuestos que ya no pueden ser identificados", agreg�.
Panabaj era, junto con Tzanchaj, un pueblo considerado la cuna de las comunidades mayas en la zona del Lago de Atitl�n. Ambos pueblos fueron fundados hace 50 a�os, pero ahora ya no existen.
Se teme que la poblaci�n entera de Panabaj haya desaparecido entre el lodo, despu�s de que un deslave arras� con todo, luego del paso de la tormenta tropical Stan.
Lodo profundo
Se teme que la poblaci�n entera de Panabaj haya desaparecido debajo del lodo.
Antes de abandonar el lugar, los trabajadores de rescate hab�an estado excavando en un �rea de un kil�metro aproximadamente, y en la que se cree puede haber por los menos unas 250 personas enterradas en unos seis o m�s metros de lodo. Hay lugares en los que el lodo alcanza 12 metros de profundidad.
Para poder excavar, los trabajadores de rescate utilizaron largos palos de madera que met�an en el barro, pero despu�s de muchos intentos frustrados, sintieron que ellos mismos corr�an el riesgo de hundirse en el lodo. Exhaustos decidieron abandonar la ardua y dif�cil tarea.
Por razones sanitarias, las leyes guatemaltecas imponen un l�mite de 72 horas para encontrar los cuerpos de personas fallecidas, b�sicamente porque �ste es un pa�s tropical y se corre el riesgo de epidemias.
Pero antes de que el �rea donde antes existi� Panabaj pueda ser declarada cementerio, se evaluar� la conveniencia de la medida.
Los habitantes de este poblado son ind�genas mayas de la etnia Tzutujil, y seg�n sus ritos y tradiciones, a los muertos se les debe dar el entierro apropiado.
Visita de Mench�
Guatemala fue el pa�s m�s castigado por el hurac�n Stan.
En conferencia de prensa, el ministro de la Defensa, Carlos Aldana, inform� que se est� estudiando la petici�n del alcalde Esquina, y que este lunes la premio N�bel de la paz, Rigoberta Mench�, viajar� a Panabaj con un grupo de expertos para evaluar el aspecto legal que se debe seguir en este caso, pero tambi�n las implicaciones culturales.
"Esta es una situaci�n que nos tiene preocupados por la cantidad de personas que supuestamente podr�an estar bajo el material producto del deslave", dijo el ministro Aldana. "Por nuestra parte, estamos considerando hacer toda una consulta, para ver el tema de declarar cementerio un sector que por el deslave sepult� a una cantidad de personas cuyo dato preciso no tenemos", agreg�. El titular de Defensa enfatiz� que el gobierno cree que se debe tomar en cuenta el aspecto cultural de esta situaci�n y los deseos de los familiares, a la hora de hacer la evaluaci�n y tomar la decisi�n final. Mensaje presidencial
Sentimos una gran preocupaci�n por las personas que a�n se encuentran desaparecidas
Oscar Berger
El presidente �scar Berger ofreci� un mensaje a la naci�n en el que exhort� a la unidad de todos los sectores guatemaltecos para lograr la recuperaci�n del pa�s.
El mandatario decret� tres d�as de duelo por los fallecidos producto del paso de Stan, cuya cifra oficial llega a m�s de 500 personas.
"Sentimos una gran preocupaci�n por las personas que a�n se encuentran desaparecidas y otras que por las inclemencias del tiempo y la imposibilidad de acceso ante la destrucci�n de infraestructura ha sido a�n humanamente imposible atender por la v�a a�rea, terrestre u otras", dijo Berger.
Asegur� que "en este momento es la m�xima prioridad de todas las autoridades su localizaci�n, su rescate y su atenci�n inmediata".
Berger agreg� que estar� al frente del programa de atenci�n del desastre, "para que las entidades del gobierno se hagan presente en todos los frentes".

Newcastle chairman Mort moves on
Mort helped bring Keegan back to St James' Park
Chris Mort has stepped down as Newcastle United chairman. He is returning to work for law firm Freshfields and deputy chairman Derek Llambias will replace him and have the new title of managing director.
The 42-year-old advised owner Mike Ashley during his takeover of the club in 2007 and played a key role in Kevin Keegan's return to Tyneside as manager.
David Williamson and Dennis Wise will be executive directors for operations and football respectively.
Mort told the club website: "The time feels right to return to Freshfields."
He became chairman in the summer of 2007 and held the responsibility for balancing the books following the departure of former chairman Freddie Shepherd.

Have your say on Mort's exit
And he said that he is leaving the club in a strong position.
"I've enjoyed my time as chairman immensely but the time was right, with high-quality individuals recruited for each of the key management roles and the club heading in the right direction," added Mort.
"I look forward to supporting the team next season and will get to as many matches as I can."
Llambias, who was appointed deputy chairman in May 2008 and is a long-term associate of Ashley, said: "We have the right people with the right expertise.
"With Kevin Keegan back as manager and being fully supported by Mike Ashley and the directors to take the club forward again."
