Boeing's workhorse
A Korean Air Boeing 747
American aircraft manufacturer Boeing launched its 747 programme, which revolutionised air travel, in 1966.
An order from Pan American World Airways set the ball rolling.
The 747 entered commercial service in 1970, and since then the worldwide fleet has flown more than 2.2 billion people.
The Boeing 747-200 is one of the older planes in the stable.
It was first built to carry both passengers and freight, and entered commercial service in 1976.
Combi models
The 747-200 Combi model was designed to carry a combination of passengers and freight depending on the needs of the airline. It would also carry different loads according to the season, with more passengers in the summer and more cargo in the winter.
The Convertible 747-200 was the first Boeing to be configured as a freighter and was designed to carry more than the earlier 747-100 model.
The 747-200 freighter has a hinged nose to allow cargo loading through the front of the aeroplane, with the option of a large side-cargo door.
A new craft, the 747-400, joined the 100, 200 and 300 models at the end of the 1980s.
The redeveloped 747-400 is currently the only model in production and is the best-selling member of the 747 family.
Accidents
Boeing 747s have been involved in three recent accidents.
On 23 September 1999, a Qantas Boeing 747, carrying 407 people on a flight from Sydney to London skidded off a runway during a tropical rainstorm at Bangkok Airport. On 6 March 1999, an Air France Boeing 747-200 cargo plane exploded in a fireball after it crash-landed in southern India,
but the crew members were rescued. In 1996, nearly 350 people were killed when two aircraft, one
a Boeing 747, collided with a Kazakh cargo jet over India, in the worst incident in Indian aviation. Search BBC News Online

ABB buffeted by fresh crisis
ABB has lost its once-stellar reputation
Shares in Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB have taken a tumble, after the firm unveiled its second management shake-up this year.
After persistent rumours that his job was not safe, chief executive Joergen Centerman stepped down on Thursday evening.
Mr Centerman, who only rose to the top job 18 months ago, cited a personal conflict with chairman Jurgen Dormann as the main factor behind his departure.
But during his brief tenure, ABB has also slumped from being one of Europe's most admired companies to last year recording the first loss in its history.
At the beginning of this year, Percy Barnevik, the firm's highly regarded chairman, announced his early departure from the company.
Problems, problems
ABB's shares, which have already halved in value since the end of last year, lost another 2% in early trading in Stockholm.
Mr Centerman says personalities clashed
Yet another change at the top," said one trader. " You can't help but get the impression that the back and forth continues and nobody knows where this is going."
ABB has lurched from one crisis to another over the past year, including being hit by heavy liabilities for asbestos use at a US subsidiary.
Early this year, Mr Barnevik was at the centre of a bizarre row over his pension allowance, which was condemned as far too generous.
Financially, the firm has a weak balance sheet, and on Wednesday agreed to sell most of its structured finance activities to a unit of General Electric.
Trimming time
The sale will cut its $5.2bn debt mountain to a more manageable $2.9bn, but further cost cuts are planned for later in the year.
Mr Dormann has little time for ABB's sprawl
Mr Dormann is believed likely to push ahead with more sales of non-core assets, notably the group's oil, gas and petrochemicals businesses. Without prompt action, analysts have said, ABB could soon become a takeover target for firms seeking to cherry-pick its best assets.
Under Mr Barnevik, ABB built a reputation for near-supernatural acquisition skills, amassing a portfolio of discrete businesses across almost all industrial engineering and technology sectors.
This sprawl is likely to be trimmed under Mr Dormann, who made a name for himself in the late 1990s by restructuring German chemical group Hoechst.

World: Europe
Van Gogh sold for over $71 million
A self-portrait by the Dutch Impressionist painter, Vincent Van Gogh, has sold in auction in New York for more than seventy-one-million dollars.
The price is the third-highest ever paid in auction for a work of art.
The painting -- "Portrait of the Artist Without His Beard" -- was completed shortly before his death, as a birthday present for his mother, while Van Gogh was in an asylum.
It was sold by the firm, Christie's, as part of an extensive auction of modern art.

Austria closes far-right chapter
Haider consistently undermined far-right ministers
The collapse of the Austrian Government is likely to push the far-right Freedom Party back into the political margins, and pave the way for the return of the centre-left Social Democrats, reports BBC News Online's Clare Murphy. When Wolfgang Schuessel announced his conservative People's Party would form a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party two years ago, some said he was entering into a pact with the devil.
Schuessel became the first conservative chancellor in 30 years
But the opportunity was too good to miss.
The deal handed the People's Party, which took just third place in 1999 general elections, the senior role in a coalition government and crowned Mr Schuessel chancellor.
In return, the anti-immigrant, anti-European Freedom Party under the leadership of the charismatic Joerg Haider entered government in what was seen as the most radical realignment of domestic politics since 1945. EU meddling
The party's spell at the top got off to a turbulent start. Within hours of the announcement of the coalition deal, the European Union had slapped diplomatic sanctions on the country.
The party could not translate Haider's flair into action
In what was condemned by some as a rather childish form of protest, some EU politicians refused to shake hands with their Austrian counterparts. One even said he would not appear in a group photo with an Austrian.
The sanctions gave the fledgling government a chance to present a united front against Brussels, whose behaviour was seen by many Austrians - even those vehemently opposed to the far-right - as undemocratic interference with a country's sovereignty.
It was only after the EU sheepishly backed down and lifted the measures that the cracks in the coalition started to emerge, as Austrians started to refocus their attention and politicians had to start getting on with the nitty-gritty of government.
In an initial attempt to thaw Austria's period of diplomatic isolation, Mr Haider had handed over the reins of the Freedom Party to vice-chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer, pledging to withdraw to his southern stronghold of Carinthia and concentrate on local affairs.
But as the party - which picked up a staggering 27% of the vote in the 1999 elections - started to violently dip in the opinion polls, Mr Haider could not keep quiet.
The far-right leader consistently criticised government politics, challenging decisions taken by Freedom Party ministers in the cabinet.
His recent forays to Baghdad, where he met Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, were thought to have seriously embarrassed far-right members of the Vienna coalition.
The latest row over tax cuts appears to have been the straw that broke the camel's back.
Return of the reds
Ms Riess-Passer's departure from the party leadership has paved the way for Mr Haider to return to the top of the Freedom Party, a position he never really relinquished.
But its two years in government have seriously damaged the party's credibility. Although it rode high on Mr Haider's rhetoric while outside the Vienna halls of power, it failed to deliver while inside them.
Analysts suggest that in the next round of elections in November, the party is unlikely to pick up more than 15% of the vote. The conservatives will fare better.
"It's very unclear how much better though," said Ferdinand Karlhofer, a political analyst at Innsbruck University.
"We'll have to wait and see what the exact fallout is for Schuessel and co., and how successfully they manage to avert the blame away for this crisis in Austrian politics from themselves."
The next elections will almost certainly mark the return of the Social Democrats, ousted after 30 years in power two years ago, despite notching up the highest score in the elections.
They could team up with the much smaller Green Party, or with the conservative People's Party, with whom they had ruled in coalition for 13 years until the deal of 2000.
But one thing looks certain. Mr Haider's Freedom Party is out - at least for the time being.

Serbs march in support of Seselj
Mr Seselj's strong nationalism is still popular with many Serbs
Thousands of people have marched in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, in support of nationalist leader Vojislav Seselj, currently on trial in The Hague.
His trial for war crimes during the break-up of Yugoslavia has been suspended since Friday because of his poor health due to a hunger strike.
Mr Seselj, 52, has been on hunger strike since 10 November.
He is accused of plotting the ethnic cleansing of former Yugoslavia in the 1990s wars. He denies any wrongdoing.
Thousands of supporters of Mr Seselj gathered near the United States embassy in Belgrade, waving Serbian flags.
Speakers condemned The Hague tribunal and the role of the United States.
Serbian nationalism
Supporters of Mr Seselj's Radical Party say the tribunal is biased against Serbia and takes its orders from the US.
His strong brand of Serbian nationalism still has appeal among many Serbs, says the BBC's correspondent in Belgrade, Nick Hawton. "The Serbian Radicals' leader is not fighting in The Hague just for his rights," said Radical Party secretary Aleksander Vucic.
"He's not fighting just for his life. But he's fighting for all of us who are gathered here. Vojislav Seselj is fighting for Serbia!"
Mr Seselj went on hunger strike three weeks ago criticising The Hague for not permitting him to conduct his defence the way he wanted.
He boycotted the start of war crimes trial on Monday and lost the right to conduct his own defence.
He is currently leader of the Serbian Radicals - the biggest party in Serbia's parliament.
He is accused of forming a joint criminal enterprise with former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, which led to the extermination and deportation of non-Serbs from Bosnia and Croatia.

US soldier's murder trial begins
Mr Calipari (pictured) was shot after rescuing a hostage journalist
The trial of a US soldier charged with the murder of an Italian intelligence agent in Iraq in March 2005 has begun in a Rome court.
The soldier, Mario Lozano of the 69th Infantry Regiment, is not attending the trial, but in Italy the defendant can be tried in absentia.
The agent, Nicola Calipari, was shot dead on his way to Baghdad airport. Mr Lozano is charged with murder and two counts of attempted murder. He denies the charges.
He was escorting Giuliana Sgrena, an Italian journalist who had just been freed by kidnappers. She was wounded in the incident, along with an Italian secret agent - Andrea Carpani - who was driving the car.
Soon after the trial opened the judge adjourned it for technical reasons until 14 May.
'Kill line'
US soldiers opened fire as the Italians' car approached a roadblock.
DIFFERING ACCOUNTS
US military: Car approaches checkpoint at high speed
Troops attempt to tell driver to stop with arm signals, lights and warning shots
Soldiers shoot into engine
Italian government: No warning signs to motorists about impending checkpoint Car not speeding and did not accelerate after warning shots
Proper inquiry impossible because vehicles removed and army logs destroyed just after shooting
Accounts in full
Profile: Nicola Calipari
Calipari, who shielded the journalist during the shooting, was hailed a hero at home, awarded Italy's top bravery award and given a state funeral attended by tens of thousands.
Franco Coppi, representing Calipari's widow, said the fact the American was not in court did not jeopardise the case.
"His absence is his own choice," he told reporters. "It does not represent an obstacle to ascertaining the truth. We are absolutely serene. The evidence gathered is indisputable."
Mr Lozano's lawyer, Alberto Biffani, said his client had no formal knowledge of the trial proceedings.
Lawyer Franco Coppi called that statement "an insult" and accused Mr Lozano of "a form of arrogance".
Mr Lozano's defence team say the incident was caused by the Italians' "lack of caution", adding that they should have had a military escort.
Italy and the US drew very different conclusions over what had happened. The US military said the vehicle was travelling too fast, alarming soldiers, who feared it was an insurgent attack. Italian officials claimed the car was travelling at normal speed and accused the US military of failing to signal there was a checkpoint.
Mario Lozano, both countries agree, fired the fatal shots.
He has told newspapers he had little choice but to open fire.
Explaining the rules of an engagement at a roadblock, he said: "You have a warning line, you have a danger line, and you have a kill line." The soldier said he flashed a spotlight at the vehicle as it approached, then fired warning shots, and then fired at the engine.

SNP promises action on housing
Housing repairs were debated at the conference
Action is needed to tackle the "chronic underfunding" of housing repairs, the Scottish National Party conference has heard.
MSP Kenny Gibson told delegates in Inverness that 40% of homes have at least one problem in need of repair.
He argued that housing repair grants should be restored to 75%.
Activists backed a resolution from Mr Gibson and fellow MSP Tricia Marwick which called for the abolition of means testing as a way of deciding eligibility for grants.
The conference ends on Saturday
The motion also demanded that the level of government subsidies should rise in line with inflation.
"The chronic underfunding of housing repairs needs to be addressed," said Mr Gibson.
"The SNP would seek to do just that by reforming the housing repair grants system to ensure that the resources are there to improve the standard and quality of our housing stock."
He said improvements to council houses
were being held back because owner-occupiers in the same estates could not
afford to renovate their own properties.
He said the Scottish Executive's flagship Housing Act had failed to address this problem.
Means testing
Mr Gibson also said that the money available to local authorities for private repair and improvement grants had fallen from �107m to �38m under Labour.
He said an SNP government would reverse this cut, abolish means testing and link the level of grants available to inflation.
Party activist Catriona Clark argued that abolishing means testing would lead to poorer tenants effectively subsidising well-off owner-occupiers.
However, Mr Gibson said it was a "myth" that those who bought their houses were better off than council tenants.
Fraternal speech
Health spokeswoman Nicola Sturgeon also addressed the final day of the conference to spell out her priorities for reforming the health service.
Her proposals included an 11% pay rise for nurses and a reduction in waiting times.
The event also heard a fraternal speech from Elfyn Llywd, the leader of Welsh party Plaid Cymru on Saturday.
SNP president Winnie Ewing brought the conference to a close with a rallying cry to delegates.
She said that the party could win the election next May if it stuck by its principles.

Button in pole position at Monaco
Championship leader Jenson Button will start the Monaco Grand Prix in pole position after a dramatic qualifying session which saw Lewis Hamilton crash.The Brawn GP driver set a time of one minute 14.902 seconds late on, to push Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen into second place on the grid for the 78-lap race. But it was a disastrous day for fellow Brit and current champion Hamilton, who'll be starting back in 16th place. It comes after he crashed into a tyre wall, breaking his rear suspension.

Lewis Hamilton walks back to the pits after his crash
Afterwards he said the crash had cost him the chance of winning at Monaco for the second year in a row. "I don't know what I was thinking, I made a mistake," he said. "I apologise to the team for wasting their time. Meanwhile, Button will be hoping to stay in front and claim his first victory at Monaco, on a circuit that is known for being difficult to overtake on. "Today was a really hard fight," he said. "Qualifying was manic as it always is in Monaco, I was right on the edge with that lap and to just snatch pole like that - I was chuffed to bits."

Reaction to Flintoff retirement
Flintoff's latest injury flared up during the first Ashes Test against Australia
Andrew Flintoff will call time on his Test career at the age of 31 at the end of the Ashes Test series.The England all-rounder has battled with a succession of injuries and said on Wednesday that "my body has told me it's time to stop". Some of the biggest names in cricket give their reaction to Flintoff's announcement. ENGLAND CAPTAIN ANDREW STRAUSS
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Strauss full of praise for Flintoff
"I think he's had a dramatic effect on world cricket. He helped bring a new audience to the game and within the four walls of the changing room he kept us going at times when things were pretty difficult. "He could be inspirational both by what he did on the pitch but also how he was around the lads and he will be missed. "The way he plays the game, the way he took the game to the opposition with the bat and the wholehearted way he bowled, it's pretty hard not to be impressed by the way he plays the game. "He's had some great days for England and he's always contributed, even when he wasn't taking five wickets or scoring hundreds. "As much as anything just as a personality the way he's played his cricket has been a great asset to the game." AUSTRALIA CAPTAIN RICKY PONTING
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Flintoff retirement surprises Ponting
"He's been a great figure in the game. "The way he's gone about his cricket, the way he's played the game and how much he's enjoyed the battle - probably particularly in Ashes cricket - is something that's been very fun to be a part of for me. "If you look at his bare statistics, they probably don't rate that flatteringly, but as far as someone that has an impact on the way a team plays and performs then he seems to be right up there." FORMER ENGLAND CAPTAIN IAN BOTHAM
"Throughout the summer (of the 2005 Ashes) he was the leader of the pack and was able to do almost anything he wanted on a cricket field," Botham told the Daily Mirror. "His batting, bowling and fielding were in perfect harmony and that can never be taken away from him. "Since then the body has let him down and you can't keep shoving needles into a bloke and expect him to be fine." FORMER ENGLAND CAPTAIN GRAHAM GOOCH
"He's not been the biggest influence on all the Test matches he's played but he does have a presence, and that brings others along with him.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "He has the ability to be able to get big players out. Certainly that was shown at the height of his career when England won the Ashes in 2005. "He is a favourite of the fans who can relate to him - that sort of cricketer where you play as hard on the field as hard off the field. "He's a dying breed. The modern cricketer doesn't fall into that psyche, with all the trainers and off-field staff they have following them. I'm afraid that Fred is the last character to play Test cricket. They are few and far between nowadays." FORMER ENGLAND BOWLER DARREN GOUGH
"What I think is quite obvious with 'Fred', and to those who play with him, is the pain he goes through. I went through it in 2002, and that's when I decided I couldn't do it any more at that level. "He set himself a huge standard in 2005 with those (Ashes) performances. In that series he was probably the best player in the world. "He'll give it one last blast against Australia; see if he can win the Ashes one more time. It was always his dream - it's his passion to play against them." FORMER ENGLAND CAPTAIN MICHAEL ATHERTON
"He'll look back on the 2005 series as the high point of his career, maybe his life, in years to come. "He has been a very good Test match cricketer, not a great one but a very good one who had a great series in 2005. His career's not over because he'll want to play some more one-day international cricket. I suspect he'll feel absolutely fulfilled." FORMER ENGLAND BOWLER ANGUS FRASER
"You watch him bowling on a lifeless pitch against top Indian batsmen under a cloudless sky - and the bloke just runs in and gives you his all over and over. "Eighty per cent or 75% of what he wants to be is not enough. He puts his body on the line all the time, and if he cannot commit to that I suppose it just makes his mind up." FORMER ENGLAND SPINNER ASHLEY GILES
"I guess it's the end of an era. He was an electric cricketer, an absolute star on the pitch, a match-winner - and quite entertaining off the pitch as well. "He's been a great servant to English cricket, so when he gives away Test cricket I think we all wish him the best. "'Freddie' was a pretty messy man in the dressing room. But on the field, when he crossed that line, he was such a great competitor and someone you'd always want playing with you rather than against you. "I guess 2005 would probably be the pinnacle for him in Test cricket, and he went a long way to helping us win that series." FORMER INDIA CAPTAIN SOURAV GANGULY
"It's a big loss for England. I always said England needed to balance his bowling with his batting if they wanted him to survive longer in Test cricket. "With England, every time they are under pressure it is 'Freddie' with the ball - because he is their best bowler. He's a big boy, and injuries are part and parcel of sport, but there are other fast bowlers around the world who are running in and keep playing and doing well in Test matches. "I think this has a lot to do with his body - and at the end of the day, he had to make a call on which version of the game he wants to play the most." LANCASHIRE CRICKET DIRECTOR MIKE WATKINSON
"The decision has come as a surprise to us, but Fred loves playing cricket for England and he would not have taken this decision lightly. Fred knows he has the full support of Lancashire and we are here to help him in anyway we can. "He will obviously talk to the ECB about his future and then we'll do the same, but we look forward to having a closer relationship with Fred over the coming years. Although he hasn't played much for us over the past four or five years, he loves playing for Lancashire and always brings something special to the Old Trafford dressing-room. "Fred is one of the best all-rounders in the world and it will be disappointing not to see him playing Test cricket for England, but England's loss will hopefully benefit Lancashire. "He is an inspirational character and highly respected by his peers, the press and the public, and I'm sure this decision will enable him to continue his career for years to come."

Hull 3 - 2 Everton
By Mandeep Sanghera
Hull's Dawson (left) and Everton's Saha each scored for their sides
Hull held off an Everton fightback to earn a win which moves them level with their struggling opponents.Stephen Hunt powered in a shot for the home side after Jozy Altidore's effort had been parried by keeper Tim Howard. Andy Dawson's free-kick and a Dean Marney shot added to the lead but Hull's Kamil Zayatte sliced a clearance into his own goal to give Everton hope. Zayatte conceded a penalty which Louis Saha converted for the visitors but the Tigers clung on for victory. Everton must have been on the end of a verbal bashing from manager David Moyes at half-time as they came out a different side after the break. However, their efforts came too late to rescue a dire opening half as the home side were resolute enough to earn three points and leave the Toffees with only one win in 10 games.
FOOTBALL BLOG
Bill Kenwright witnessed the unpalatable present as he suffered the latest evidence of Everton's decline in defeat at Hull City - and was then left to digest an uncertain future
BBC Sport's Phil McNulty
Hull had gone into the match without Jimmy Bullard as boss Phil Brown decided to rest his star man so that the midfield playmaker could recover from a minor knock to his knee. Bullard has had a major impact for the Tigers since his recovery from a lengthy spell out injured but Brown was taking the longer term view when leaving him out and the home side initially made light of his absence. Hull went ahead after Everton defenders Sylvain Distin and Leighton Baines missed a deflected Hunt cross to allow Altidore to hammer a point-blank shot, which Howard did well to fend away.

But Hunt had drifted in from the left and, with the Toffees defence sleeping, pounced to lash in the loose ball from eight yards. The goal lifted Hull, while having the reverse effect on the visitors and the Tigers capitalised by extending their lead through Dawson's precise 25-yard free-kick into the top corner. Everton had beaten Hull 4-0 at the KC Stadium in the Carling Cup earlier this season but were a different proposition this time around as they looked a team sapped of belief and confidence. Too many of their passes were going astray, there was a lack of movement and, most unusually for the Merseysiders, they lacked fight. A Baines corner was headed just over by Distin in a rare moment of threat from Everton but they soon found themselves further behind. Distin inadvertently diverted a low cross to Marney and, symbolic of Everton's fortunes, the Hull midfielder's shot went in off Tim Cahill.

Everton belatedly showed the passion their play had been missing in the second half and they were rewarded when Zayatte swung at a Johnny Heitinga cross only to slice the ball into his own net. Zayatte was also involved in Everton's second goal as he was punished for a high challenge on Saha, who had expertly taken down a diagonal ball from Cahill in the box. Saha dispatched the penalty with ease to set up a jittery finale for Hull. Richard Garcia had a shot saved by Howard, while Cahill sent a long range strike over at the other end as more goals looked on the cards. However, Hull had enough grit to hold Everton at arm's length and notch their fourth home win of the Premier League season. Hull City boss Phil Brown: "I think it was a deserved win, even though Everton scored two goals in the second half. People might have been nervous at 3-2 but I wasn't unduly worried, I thought we still had a grip on the game. "Defensively, we were very good in the first half. The second half was a different ball game and an own goal unhinges you to a certain extent. "But we stuck at the task and thoroughly deserved the victory. "Jimmy Bullard's in a new area of his rehabilitation. It was just a precautionary resting and fortunately it has worked for everybody. "It now gives me a bit of a headache for Saturday, but they are the kind of headaches you want." Live text and stats

BBC Sport at Aintree
Ladies Day makes for a colourful sight at Aintree
A relatively recent innovation, Ladies Day at the Grand National meeting has already become something of an Aintree tradition.
The idea stems from Ladies Day at Royal Ascot and many of the outlandish and colourful designs at Aintree are similar to outfits often seen at the prestigious Flat meeting.
But while Royal Ascot takes place in mid-June, Aintree is in early April and weather conditions are noticeably cooler.
Not that you would realise it from some of the distinctly "summery" outfits on display.
Aintree hosts one of the most famous jumps meetings in the world but many of the women of Merseyside seem to think of it more as an all-weather event.
The skies over Liverpool were grey and chilly yet the dresses of many of the estimated 45,000 spectators racegoers spoke of sunshine and balmy evenings.
Sleeveless, strapless, chiffon - the amount of bare flesh visible was enough to cause goosepimples even among the well wrapped-up Barbour brigade.
Yet there is a good humour and joie de vivre that is often missing at the more formal Ascot meeting.
The racegoers don't take themselves too seriously but when it comes to fashion, it is a different matter.
Hats dominate the fashion stakes with racegoers
And this year saw an added incentive to make that extra effort as there was a brand new �20,000 Jaguar X-Type on offer to the "best dressed racegoer" on Friday.
More than 300 entrants strutted their stuff on a catwalk erected in the winner's enclosure in the hope of winning the keys.
A panel of judges whittled them down to six - including a token male - and then an overall winner was announced.
There was some consternation among locals when it was discovered that the winner hailed from foreign parts, ie, Formby, but the competition was deemed a huge success.
Racing is currently on a drive to attract people to come to watch the sport live and organisers hope that diversions such as these will boost crowds.
There were certainly signs that racegoers were developing an interest in National Hunt by the time the last race had been run on Friday.
For example, the number of women who took their shoes off to get a better feel of the going will be most encouraging to the sport's rulers.
