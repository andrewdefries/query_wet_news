White House backs torture ban law
US interrogation policies have been under scrutiny since 2001
President George Bush has withdrawn his opposition to legislation banning cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of terrorist suspects.
He said it would show the world that the US did not use torture.
Sponsored by Republican Senator John McCain, the law on torture has been the subject of months of negotiations between Congress and the White House.
Mr Bush had threatened to veto the measure, saying it would constrain the military and intelligence agencies.
We've been happy to work with him to achieve a common objective - and that is to make it clear to the world that this government does not torture
President Bush
Bush bows to pressure
Defining torture
But when both the Senate and the House of Representatives came out overwhelmingly in favour of the legislation, Mr Bush did not have much choice, says the BBC's Adam Brookes - even though it is a blow to presidential authority.
It is also being seen as bitter personal defeat for Vice-President Dick Cheney, who had telephoned every Republican senator to try to get the measure derailed.
'Hearts and minds'
The US is already a signatory to the UN Convention on Torture.
Correspondents say the new law would appear to remove a grey area between tactics that are less severe than torture, but harsher than those allowed by the US army's field manual.
The new legislation would make the rules in the manual the benchmark for future interrogations. Mr McCain, once a prisoner of war who was tortured in Vietnam and now senator for Arizona, proposed the measure as an amendment to a military spending bill.
The move was announced at a joint White House news conference
The law's supporters argued that it would repair some of the damage done to America's international standing by detainee abuse scandals in Iraq and Afghanistan. The White House said it would make US interrogators and guards much more vulnerable to lawsuits filed by aggrieved detainees.
Both the Senate and the House of Representatives, which are controlled by the Republicans, disagreed.
Setting the standard
At a joint news conference with Mr McCain at the White House, Mr Bush did not directly mention the new law.
We have sent a message to the world that the US is not like the terrorists

But referring to Mr McCain, he said: "We've been happy to work with him to achieve a common objective - and that is to make it clear to the world that this government does not torture, and that we adhere to the International Convention of Torture whether it be here at home or abroad."
Senator McCain said the law would help win "hearts and minds" in the fight against terrorism.
"We have sent a message to the world that the US is not like the terrorists," he said.
"We have no brief for them. But what we are is a nation that upholds values and standards of behaviour and treatment of all people, no matter how evil or bad they are."

AIG posts second quarterly profit
The insurer still owes the government $85.7bn in loans
Insurer AIG, which was saved by the US government last year, has reported its second straight quarterly profit.Net income for the three months to September was $92m, compared with a loss of $24.5bn in the same quarter last year - when it was bailed out. However, AIG's shares fell 6.6% after chief Robert Benmosche warned the firm's run of profits may not continue. "Expect continued volatility in reported results in the coming quarters," Mr Benmosche said. This would be because of restructuring charges, AIG said. AIG was bailed out by the US government in 2008 and is now 80% state-owned. In total, the firm has received $182.5bn of government funding. Government helpThe $92m in net profit was what is available to its shareholders. Including the government's share as a result of its stake, AIG earned $455m in the quarter. As of 30 September, AIG's outstanding assistance from the government was $122.31bn, down 4% from the previous quarter. Of that, AIG owes the US government $85.66bn in loans and interest. The remaining aid is tied to the value of some of the toxic assets that the government bought from AIG, where the government recoups more money if their value rises. "We continue to focus on stabilising and strengthening our businesses," Mr Benmosche said.

Sequel 'may not harm Salinger' JD Salinger has not published a book in decades
A US judge has questioned whether a new book, promoted as a sequel to JD Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye, would harm Salinger's copyright.Lawyers for Swedish novelist Fredrik Colting, who wrote 60 Years Later: Coming Through The Rye, are appealing against a US publication ban. Judge Guido Calabresi called the spin-off a "rather dismal piece of work". He added: "Anybody can just go on the internet and get the London edition." The book came out in the UK in June. A panel of three US appeals court judges, in New York, are considering whether the new book could cause irreparable harm to Salinger, which would be legal grounds for blocking US publication. In July, Judge Deborah Batts issued a preliminary injunction, indefinitely banning the publication, advertising or distribution of the book in the US. 'Transformative work'Judge Batts concluded that Mr Colting's novel too closely mirrored Mr Salinger's 1951 classic. In her 37-page ruling, issued in Manhattan, she said the main character in Mr Colting's novel - Mr C - was "an infringement" on Mr Salinger's main character, Holden Caulfield. Mr Colting claims his book, featuring a character based on Salinger's hero, is a literary commentary not a sequel. "Our position is this is not a sequel," lawyer Edward Rosenthal told the appeals court. "This is a highly transformative work about the relationship between Salinger and his character." He added that there was no evidence his client's book would limit the value of any possible Salinger sequel. Film optionSpeaking in court on Thursday, Mr Salinger's lawyer, Marcia Paul, reiterated that her client "does not want to authorise a sequel or a derivative". She added that over the years the author had turned down requests to adapt the original book for the screen by film-maker Steven Spielberg and producer Harvey Weinstein. The Catcher In The Rye, first published in 1951, is a tale of adolescent alienation and has become one of the most influential American novels of the modern era. The novel sees Caulfield wandering around New York and railing against the establishment, following his expulsion from boarding school. Mr Colting's novel sees 76-year-old Mr C - who the author has admitted is based on Caulfield - escape from a retirement home and head to New York. Both books end near a carousel in Central Park.

No more broken hearts? No More Broken Hearts?Sunday 24 June 2001

Two consultant paediatric surgeons and the hospitals Chief Executive were struck off the medical register and an exhaustive Inquiry into the Bristol tragedy is just about to be published. But could Bristol happen again? Panorama investigates the efforts of the medical profession to tackle the problems that the tragedy brought to light and considers whether surgeons should have their results made public.

Ghana v Australia team news:
Ghana have been forced into two changes at the back by injuries to captain John Mensah and Isaac Vorsah, with Lee Addy and 19-year-old defender Jonathan Mensah (no relation) stepping in. Harry Kewell will lead the Australia attack for their must-win Group D clash. The former Liverpool forward’s call-up is one of four changes by coach Pim Verbeek to the side that lost 4-0 to Germany in their opening match. David Carney replaces left-back Scott Chipperfield, Mark Bresciano replaces the injured Vince Grella and Brett Holman comes in for the suspended Tim Cahill.

These two have played six times before, with Australia winning four of them, perhaps surprisingly. One of these friendlies was actually played in South Africa, on 14 September 1996, when goals from Damien Mori and Paul Trimboli earned the Socceroos a 2-0 victory.

“It is like a big, big family, the Ghana squad. I've not been here a long time but I already can say I'm a family member. There's a lot of love in the team. We pray a lot, so there is a fantastic spirit. We try to take that spirit on the pitch so everyone is there for each other.”

“We are driven by failure. We are driven by the fear of not winning a game and not getting out of this group. We got together after the Germany game and said we are not going to go out with a fizzle.”

"I've watched Steven Gerrard for a very long time and you cannot play him out on the left, it stifles him and when he comes inside, which he always will do, it unbalances the side. He has got to play just off Wayne Rooney - let him go where he wants."

BBC Sport's Alan Hansen
"I think the biggest worry for Fabio Capello is Wayne Rooney. If his display last night was the result of a long, hard season at Manchester United, then he's not coming back from it."

From ploasd: "Don't care if Australia happen to lose, all I want is for them to show some heart. They are not that bad."

IT'S SUNNY
The teams emerge into the sunshine at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg and we're about to listen to the national anthems of Ghana and Australia.

Commentary
The super-confident Kevin-Prince Boateng winks at the camera as it works its way down the line of Ghana players and after Advance Australia Fair we are moments away from kick-off.

KICK-OFF
Ghana v Australia
This is the 100th match an African nation has played in the World Cup and Australia have the honour of getting us under way.
Contributor
BBC Sport's Mark Bright
"Ghana have two very inexperienced players at centre-back today, so they will need their full-backs to help them out a bit. It's such a crucial position."
2 mins
Commentary
Harry Kewell goes down in the Ghana box after a coming together with Lee Addy, but referee Roberto Rosetti waves play on.
4 mins
Commentary
Good, confident start from Australia, keen to dictate the tempo of the game early on. They must be desperate to prove they aren't as bad as that 4-0 drubbing by Germany suggests.
6 mins
Commentary
First sighter for Ghana, but Kevin-Prince Boateng drags a shot wide from about 30 yards. He's got 'Prince' on the back of his shirt.
SMS
From Ben, Manchester: "I've been trying to work this out since Ghana played Serbia and it's really starting to bug me... Why does Pantsil have one long sleeve and one short sleeve?!"
10 mins
Commentary
Ghana are having a better spell now and they force their first corner of the game, but it doesn't clear the first man, one of the most frustrating things to see of all when you're watching football.
11 mins
Commentary
Promising run forward from Carl Valeri for Australia and he is brought down about 28 yards away from the Ghana goal. Surely someone fancies this...
11 mins
GOAL
Ghana 0-1 Australia
They probably just about deserve it for a decent start, but it's another goalkeeping howler. Mark Bresciano's right-foot shot bounces in front of Richard Kingson and he can only block it into the path of Brett Holman, who taps in from close-range.
Contributor
BBC Sport's Mark Bright
"The bounce caused the goalkeeper a problem, but he will have wanted to see his defenders getting in there first and they were nowhere to be seen."
16 mins
Commentary
The goal looks like it has just affected Ghana, coming as it did at a time when they were starting to get a foothold in the game. Will be interesting to see how they play it from now on - if it finishes like this, then every team in Group D will have won one and lost one.
19 mins
Commentary
There's an awful lot of canary yell- sorry, Australian gold in the crowd, good support for the Socceroos after their 4-0 battering by Germany. They are playing well today, looking more comfortable on the ball and more dangerous up front too.
20 mins
Commentary
Better from Ghana as Andre Ayew fires in a left-foot shot from the edge of the Australian area and it takes a deflection off Craig Moore before going behind for a corner.
Contributor
BBC Radio 5 live's Danny Mills
"Just looking around the stadium it's disappointing to see so many empty seats. This is the World Cup, surely Fifa, or somebody, should have addressed this situation. You want as many people as possible to see it. There are obviously a lot of people who would want to come but can't get tickets or the tickets are too expensive."

Much, much better from Ghana as Asamoah Gyan's shot is deflected over.

GOAL
Ghana 1-1 Australia
That might be the turning point of the game - and the competition for both teams. A Ghana cross from the right finds Jonathan Mensah and his goalbound shot hits Harry Kewell on the line. It seems to hit a combination of his chest and right arm and Italian referee Roberto Rosetti points to the spot and shows Kewell a straight red. Asamoah Gyan steps up and confidently slots home the penalty. Do the Americans call that a 'game-changer'?
28 mins
Commentary
Harry Kewell has lingered off the pitch for a long time, remonstrating with anyone who will listen. Eventually a Fifa official leads him off down the tunnel and into the dressing-room. His World Cup lasted 24 minutes.
31 mins
Commentary
Horrible decision for the referee to have to make, but once Roberto Rosetti has decided it was a penalty, he had no option but to send Harry Kewell off. I wonder whether Australia can bounce back from that hammer blow.
606
From eirebilly: "Kewell couldn't get his arm out of the way as it was positively smashed at him. The letter of the law says red card. It's not harsh it's just unlucky."
34 mins
Commentary
Australia have had 56% of the possession so far, but it's a safe bet that will come down now they have only 10 men. Ghana are buzzing, but there's a long way to go in this one yet.
36 mins
Commentary
Free-kick given away in a dangerous position by Craig Moore, bringing down Kwadwo Asamoah about 22 yards out, very central.
37 mins
Commentary
Kwadwo Asamoah takes it left-footed and lazy and it hits the wall. Some of the free-kick taking remains abject at this tournament.
Twitter
From nanaloa2001: "Actually, there was a case for two penalties. A player was brought down before the ball struck Kewell's arm. Any more doubts?"
40 mins
YELLOW CARD
The referee flashes a yellow card in the direction of Ghana's Lee Addy for a reckless lunge from behind on Mark Bresciano.
42 mins
Commentary
Kevin-Prince Boateng sends over two decent crosses from the Ghana right, but the first one is cleared and the second plucked from the air by Mark Schwarzer.
44 mins
Commentary
Brilliant football. Kevin-Prince Boateng wins the ball back for Ghana just inside the Australian half and surges towards goal - he hits a goalbound right-foot drive that is heading for the bottom corner until Mark Schwarzer gets down superbly to tip it behind. The referee give a goalkick - makes you wonder sometimes.
15:45
HALF-TIME
Ghana 1-1 Australia
The Aussies are not a happy bunch as Roberto Rosetti blows the whistle for half-time in Rustenburg. Ghana stay on the pitch for a huddle before returning to the dressing-room.

BBC Sport's Emmanuel Adebayor
"After Ghana got back into the game they played quite well but they had started slowly. Ghana know now that they have one chance to get to the last 16 - and that chance is now."
15:51
Commentary
Meanwhile it is all kicking off in the French camp. Down-but-not-quite-out yet, striker Nicolas Anelka missed training on Saturday after reports of a bust-up with coach Raymond Domenech. Keep you posted on that one.
Contributor
BBC Sport's Jurgen Klinsmann
"This game is there for the taking for Ghana, but I wouldn't write off Australia yet. A man down, they might just think they should go for it."
SMS
From AG: "To Ben in Manchester (see earlier): I’m at the match. Pantsil has a short-sleeved shirt and a long undershirt rolled down on one arm only."
606
From salamsm: "Kewell should know that once you are defending on the goal line, your hands should not be within sight of making a possible contact with the ball. The laws state that once a goalscoring opportunity has been denied by a player with his hands, a red card should be given as well as a penalty. Definitely a penalty and unfortunately a red card as well."

Back under way at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, it's Ghana 1-1 Australia at the break.

"I think we might see a change of pace from Ghana in the second half, they might play a bit quicker and put Australia under more pressure."

Asamoah Gyan comes in from the Ghana left and curls a shot goalwards that Mark Schwarzer saves low down to his left. Good signal of their intent at the start of the half from the African side.

From thomavenel: "Word here in France is that several players are ready to come back home today. The Anelka story just the tip of the iceberg."
54 mins
Commentary
Bit better from Australia as they force a corner on the right, but Ghana clear their lines. The Socceroos need to take advantage of every set-piece they get in this half.
55 mins
Commentary
Kwadwo Asamoah does like to shoot, that much is certain. Another from a ludicrous distance is deflected into the arms of Mark Schwarzer. Will take something pretty special to beat the Fulham keeper from there.

Another set-piece for the Aussies but Craig Moore is under pressure and can only head wide from Luke Wilkshire's free-kick.

From mhla200: "Ghana are annoying me now, why not use the extra man instead of trying to shoot from the halfway line?"
62 mins
Commentary
The noise in Rustenburg ramps up a notch for a Ghana free-kick, but it's easily headed away by Craig Moore. I think the Aussies would probably take a point right now, but they might fancy nicking three late on if they can keep Ghana out.
63 mins
Commentary
Now it's Kevin-Prince Boateng's turn to shoot wide - this time from about 40 yards. What a waste of everyone's time.
65 mins
Commentary
They are just trying to win it on their own, the Ghana players. Kwadwo Asamoah does really well to burst into space outside the Australia half, but he doesn't even look for where his team-mates are - he just shoots at a defender.
66 mins
SUBSTITUTION
Australia send on Scott Chipperfield for Mark Bresciano.
67 mins
Commentary
That's a real chance, that. Australia work the ball well down the right and Luke Wilkshire sends over a fine cross to the back post where Scott Chipperfield gets up well only to head over.
67 mins
Commentary
It's end-to-end now. Ghana go straight up the other end and Asamoah Gyan fires over a cross from the right - it beats Mark Schwarzer in the six-yard box, but Kwadwo Asamoah cannot quite touch it in at the far post.
68 mins

Striker Josh Kennedy comes on for Australia in place of their goalscorer Brett Holman.

71 mins
Commentary
Chance, shot, wide. Kevin-Prince Boateng slips a lovely pass in for Asamoah Gyan (see what can be done?) but he gets his angles wrong from 14 yards and slices a left-foot effort wide.
73 mins
Commentary
What an unbelievable chance for Australia. Luke wilkshire is played through on the right of the area and his low shot brings a fabulous save from Richard Kingson, with Josh Kennedy only able to hit the rebound into the floor for Kingson to gather.
Contributor
BBC Sport's Mark Bright
"It's been so slow their play, Ghana, they've never upped the pace and had a real go and they've allowed Australia in the game too much."
77 mins
SUBSTITUTION
Ghana take Kwadwo Asamoah off and send on Sulley Muntari.
Contributor
BBC Radio 5 live's Danny Mills
"The problem the Ghanaians have is that they can't use their pace and power because the Australians are sitting deep. They need Australia to start attacking, which they are starting to do, so the gaps may open up. Australia are giving it everything."
79 mins
YELLOW CARD
You know what? This is another enthralling game of football. The 10 men of Australia have been magnificent since Harry Kewell's early sending off, but can they hold out? Or can they go and win it? Jonathan Mensah is booked for a foul on Scott Chipperfield and Australia have a free-kick about 25 yards out.
80 mins

Brett Emerton fires it in, but it's about five yards too high and Richard Kingson watches it go over.

Anthony Annan is booked for a foul on Scott Chipperfield - since the subs, the Socceroos have been on top. Meanwhile, I just got a text from an English girl in Sydney supporting Australia - you know who you are, Kirsty. Not sure that should be allowed. Luke Wilkshire is replaced by Nikita Rukavytsya.
Contributor
BBC Sport's Mark Bright
"Full credit to Australia - they have really hung in there and now they are having a go at winning this game."
86 mins
YELLOW CARD
The Australians are the ones making the noise in Rustenburg - they fancy they can still win this game. There's some pinball inside the Ghana box, but nothing comes of it. Craig Moore has been booked for the Aussies, while Ghana bring on Matthew Amoah for Kevin-Prince Boateng, who has faded badly.
88 mins
Commentary
Ghana look rattled, big time. Nikita Rukavytsya tries to divert a cross from the Australian left goalwards, but Richard Kingson is brave and the Ghana keeper does well to prevent the ball going in.
Commentary
England striker Wayne Rooney:
"Last night, on reflection I said things in the heat of the moment that came out of frustration of both our performance and the result. For my part I apologise for any offence caused by my actions at the end of the game."
90 mins
INJURY TIME
Good chance, but this time for Ghana. Sulley Muntari swings over a free-kick from the left and it is met by Jonathan Mensah at the back post - he can only nod it wide. We're into three minutes of stoppage time now.
90 mins
Commentary
A corner is half-cleared by Australia and from 25 yards Quincy Owusu-Abeyie forces Mark Schwarzer to tip over. From the corner, Sulley Muntari fires over the top. Ghana have had 22 shots to Australia's seven today.
90 mins
Commentary
John Pantsil is in some trouble here - he went up for a header but looked like he headed the back of a team-mate AND was headed from behind by Josh Kennedy. There is claret all over his sleeve and he will be stretchered off. Let's hope he's OK.
16:50
FULL-TIME
Ghana 1-1 Australia
That brings to an end another fine game of football - Ghana are on four points in Group D now, Australia have one, but the Socceroos produced a determined display there after playing with 10 men for more than an hour.

BBC Sport's Alan Hansen
"Ghana certainly had more of the chances, but Australia probably had the better ones in that second half."

BBC Sport's Emmanuel Adebayor
"I think Ghana have put themselves in a very difficult situation now because they are playing a Germany team who need to win in their last game."

BBC Radio 5 live's Danny Mills
"Fair play to Australia, they defended well and they had a right good go. They thoroughly deserve a point out of that and it keeps them in the tournament which is great for them. Ghana, on the other hand... well, if I was Germany I would just defend deep against them."

What did Carlo Ancelotti say to his players after they won the Premier League and FA Cup Double?! Anyway, enough of that harmless fun, I'll see you in a little while for a bit of Cameroon v Japan. Boy could they both do with winning that one. Laters.
By Sam Sheringham
Australia overcame the first-half dismissal of Harry Kewell to battle for a draw against Ghana that keeps their slim hopes of reaching the World Cup second round alive.
The Socceroos, hammered 4-0 by Germany in their opening Group D game, took an early lead through Brett Holman before former Liverpool forward Kewell was shown a straight red for a handball on the goal-line and Asamoah Gyan slotted home his second penalty of the tournament.But an inexperienced Ghana side struggled against 10 men, showing limited imagination and resorting to shot after shot from long range.And it was Australia who came closest to winning the match when Luke Wilkshire failed to beat Black Stars goalkeeper Richard Kingston when clean through on goal.It was an impressive display from the Australians who had been lambasted by their national press after a meek opening performance and suffered the hammer blow of having a key man sent off for the second game in a row.The Socceroos could still emulate their 2006 effort of reaching last 16 in South Africa if they defeat Serbia in their final game on Wednesday, while Ghana need only a point against the Germans to advance.While injuries to captain John Mensah and Isaac Vorsah forced Ghana boss Milan Rajevac to field an inexperienced centre-back pairing of Lee Addy and Jonathan Mensah, under-fire Australia coach Pim Verbeek made four changes to the side that lost to Germany with Kewell called in to lead the attack.And Kewell was immediately in the thick of the action, going down twice inside the area in the first 10 minutes but seeing both his penalty appeals turned down by Italian referee Roberto Rosetti.The Socceroos had reason to thank the official shortly afterwards when he awarded the free-kick from which they took the lead.Mark Bresciano's 30-yard strike bounced awkwardly in front of Kingston, but the keeper should have done more than just parrying the ball straight in front of him. Holman reacted quickest to clip the loose ball into the top corner.Kingston has played more for his country than his club in the last four years and his sloppy work provided another page in the catalogue of goalkeeping gaffes at this World Cup.Ghana, the only African team to win at the tournament so far, reacted with a series of pacy attacks and they did not have to wait long for their equaliser.Andre Ayew showed great determination to work some space for himself on the byline and produce a measured cut-back to Mensah, whose powerful goalbound shot struck Kewell on the arm.Kewell protested that the ball had hit his chest and implored the referee to watch the replay on the big screen but when the incident was shown again it entirely vindicated the decision to award a penalty and show the Australia frontman a red card.Gyan sent Socceroos keeper Mark Schwarzer the wrong way from the spot.The Black Stars initially made the most of their extra man, using the full width of the pitch to stretch Australia, and Rajevac's men could have gone ahead shortly before half-time.Portsmouth's Kevin-Prince Boateng worked his way into the box and unleashed a right-footed shot that was brilliantly tipped around the post by Schwarzer, who had to be at his best once again shortly after the break to claw away a curler from Gyan.Ghana seemed to lose their way as the game wore on, running out of ideas and firing speculative shots from distance which were often embarrassingly off target.The Africans' profligacy seemed to awaken their opponents' senses to the possibility that they could still win the game and the Socceroos came close on two occasions.First Scott Chipperfield headed over the bar, and then Wilkshire found acres of space in the box, but his shot was smothered by Kingston, who was on hand to gather Josh Kennedy's follow-up effort.But Ghana ended the game the stronger side with Mensah heading over from Sulley Muntari's cross and Schwarzer pulling off a one-handed save to keep out Quincy Owusu-Abeyie's long-range strike.

Maradona lands in Tokyo
Diego Maradona has arrived in Tokyo in time to attend the World Cup final after the Japanese government back-tracked on its decision to ban him from the country. The 41-year-old, who won the World Cup with Argentina in 1986, had been refused permission to enter Japan because of his history of drug abuse.
But officials relented and allowed Maradona into the country because of his legendary status in football and the fact that the World Cup is only held every four years."You are my god," said one fan waving an Argentine flag.Maradona, who has been undergoing drug rehabilitation treatment in Cuba, is expected to watch the final between Brazil and Germany in Yokahama on Sunday. Last week Maradona got the most votes in Fifa's internet poll of fans to choose a World Cup dream team.His second goal against England in their 1986 quarter-final was also voted Fifa goal of the century.
