Colombia court eases abortion ban
The issue of abortion has aroused strong passions among Colombians
Colombia's constitutional court has voted to partially legalise abortion.
The court decided to permit terminations in cases of rape, incest or if the life of the mother or foetus is in danger.
The issue has long been the subject of debate in the majority Roman Catholic country, whose president, Alvaro Uribe, had warned against easing the ban.
The ruling, by a majority of 5-3, brings Colombia into line with most of its Latin America neighbours.
"The court fulfilled its duty in recognising the right of Colombian women," lawyer and pro-choice campaigner Monica Roa was quoted by the Associated Press (AP) news agency as telling Caracol radio.
Prior to the ruling, anti-abortion groups took out advertisements in the Colombian press, calling abortion a "moral problem and not an issue of public health," AP reported.
Following the ruling, El Salvador and Chile remain the only Latin American countries where abortion is banned under any circumstances.
It is estimated about 400,000 clandestine abortions are carried out in Colombia each year.

Q&A: The Pensions White paper and you
Now that the Pensions White Paper has been published, what does it mean for your personal finances and your retirement ambitions?What is in the White Paper?The main measures are as follows: The state pension age for men and women will rise to 66 in 2024, to 67 in 2034 and 68 in 2044 each rise will be phased-in over two years The state pension will become more generous and future increases will be linked to earnings rather than prices The number of years it takes for people to qualify for a full basic state pension will be cut to just 30 From 2012, people will automatically be enrolled into a new, low-cost national savings scheme, although they have the chance to opt out if it is not suitable for them. The White Paper sets out the future of the state pension far into the twenty-first century. There is a trade-off going on. People will collect their state pension later - but it will be more generous. Put simply, restoring the earnings link means the state pension will go up in line with salaries, rather than prices - meaning bigger annual rises in the state pension than at present. However, if you want a comfortable retirement you are still going to have to save for it. Is this the end of my dream of retiring early?It depends. The idea is that you wait longer for your state pension, not that you absolutely have to continue work. PENSIONS WHITE PAPER

You will still be free to retire early as long as your employer agrees - but under the proviso that you will have to support yourself until whenever the state pension kicks in. In short, your ambitions will continue to depend on whether you can afford to give up work early. What about people who have lost their pensions?Many of the estimated 85,000 people who have lost their pensions when their company scheme collapsed received an unexpected boost. Mr Hutton announced that the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), set up to help people in acute distress following scheme collapse, will be expanded so that it encompasses more people. The Community trade union has calculated that this means the total government help for people who have lost their pensions will increase from £400m to £2.3bn. Why am I being asked to wait longer to collect my state pension?Ultimately, the reason is that the UK's population is ageing. An ageing population means that, in future, there will be fewer workers to pay the pensions of a greater number of older people. The government Pensions Commission, headed by Lord Turner, was asked to find a way that the country could defuse what has been called the "demographic time-bomb." The Commission recommended a course of action which puts as little strain as possible on the public finances while at the same time boosting the state pension. According to Lord Turner the White Paper contained about "90-95%" of the Commission's recommendations. I am a mum, staying at home to look after my child. Will there be extra pension help for me?Delivering a boost to women's pensions has been a big theme - both for the Commission in its three reports and now in the government's White Paper. At present, fewer than half of all women pay enough National Insurance Contributions (NICs) to earn the right to a full basic state pension. This is because many women take time out of the workforce to look after children and elderly relatives. Lord Turner set about reviewing the pensions system
The White Paper proposes to lower the number of years it takes to earn a basic state pension to 30. At present, women have to work 39 years to earn a basic state pension and men 44. John Hutton, Work and Pensions Secretary, said the reform would boost the percentage of women retiring with a full state pension from 30% today to 70% in 2010. In addition, Home Responsibility Protection (HRP) will be radically overhauled. HRP pays NICs for people who stay at home to look after children and elderly relatives but has been criticised as too complex and inflexible. Am I going to be forced to save for my retirement?The government has gone for a system of soft compulsion. If you are an employee, you will be automatically enrolled into the low-cost national savings scheme from 2012. Employers can opt their employees out of the saving scheme - so long as they offer their own scheme on an auto-enrolment basis and are making contributions at a higher level than would be the case under the savings scheme. Employers contributions will be phased in over three years. Employees are themselves allowed to choose to opt out of the savings scheme. And there are lots of reasons why someone might choose to do so. They may be happy with the amount of money they have put aside for their old age, or have other pressing financial commitments. Ultimately, though, the idea behind automatic enrolment is that savings rates will increase because people will think it is too much bother to opt out. But the savings scheme has been criticised by some pension experts. They suggest that it could lead to a "levelling-down" of existing workplace pensions. The fear is that employers with more lucrative pensions schemes could take advantage of the changes to shut their own schemes down - and pay the 3% to the savings scheme instead. For this reason, Alan Pickering, a former government pension adviser, has branded the savings scheme "pie in the sky". Membership of the savings scheme will not bar people from a full basic state pension. When will all these reforms happen?
GUIDE TO UK PENSIONS
Facts and figures outlining the depth of the UK pensions crisis
At-a-glance
The plan is to introduce most of the reforms over the next decade and beyond. For example, the earnings link is to be restored in the next parliament and NPSS is to be introduced in 2012. The rise in the state pension age will be phased in from the 2020s onwards. That seems like a long time. Will a change of government or prime minister scupper all this?Lord Turner has said the White Paper has "cross-party support". Indeed, the main opposition parties support re-establishing the earnings link to the state pension. But there remains potential for disagreement. The Conservative party has expressed alarm at the spread of means-testing in the pensions system. Some analysts have suggested that the proportion of people who could be claiming Pension Credit in future could rise to more than half, despite Pensions Secretary John Hutton's contention that the reforms mean it will fall to just a third. Mark Oakshott, the Lib Dems Pensions Spokesman, branded the White Paper "mean and timid", saying it ignores the divide between generous public sector pensions and those having to rely on Pensions Credit. What would happen under a Gordon Brown administration? What is more, when the Commission's recommendations were published last November they were lambasted by Treasury insiders. As for what will happen to the consensus within the government if Gordon Brown moves from number 11 to number 10 Downing Street, no-one is quite sure. Is this the end of the pensions crisis?It is far too early to call time on the pensions crisis. The White Paper certainly represent the biggest overhaul of the state pension system in 50 years. But some experts suggest that more needs to be done. The decision has yet to be made who gets to run the new national savings scheme: the government or the insurance industry. And some critics warn that the White Paper does not do enough to boost workplace pensions. After all, only a successful system of workplace pensions will ensure people get to retire on more than the bare minimum offered by the state pension. Anything else?The state second pension (S2P) is to be reformed. The S2P provides a top-up to the basic state pension. It will evolve into a flat rate system by about 2030. Experts have said that this will mean that high earners will have to pay more into the S2P. In addition, the option to contract-out of the S2P will be abolished for members of defined contribution pension schemes. Bookmark with: Delicious Digg reddit Facebook StumbleUpon What are these?

BBC 'arrogant' over money-making
Sir Michael Lyons is in charge of the BBC Trust
The BBC's governing body has been accused of "arrogance" over its response to criticism of the corporation's commercial activities.In April the Select Committee on Culture Media and Sport criticised BBC activities that generate income, saying they were harming its competitors. However the trust told the committee it could not answer all the criticisms as it was conducting its own review. The MPs said this response showed an "apparent arrogance" by the trust. In their report in April, MPs strongly criticised BBC Worldwide's purchase of the Lonely Planet, which publishes travel guides and a magazine for independent travellers. Tighter controlsThey recommended that the BBC Trust should impose tighter controls over the BBC's commercial activities, saying they were harming its competitors and should be reined in. The MPs said: "The purchase of Lonely Planet remains the most egregious example of the nature of BBC Worldwide's expansion into areas where the BBC has no, or very limited existing interests. "Had the BBC Trust been a more responsible oversight body, it would have given more serious consideration to the likely impact on the commercial sector. We can only speculate as to why it did not." The BBC Trust defended the Lonely Planet purchase but told the committee it could not respond to all the recommendations because it was conducting its own review of BBC Worldwide - and there were talks over a possible tie-up with Channel 4. The MPs said the trust appeared to believe it had no case to answer and its response was not "coherent". However the select committee welcomed an announcement by the trust last week, changing the governance of BBC Worldwide as the committee had recommended.

Fertility clinics fear ID fraud
By Caroline Ryan
BBC News, Prague
There is concern over the checks process
Fertility clinics fear they are at risk of identity fraud by patients, say UK researchers.
A survey of 45 clinics found 37% had experienced or suspected ID fraud, a European fertility conference heard.
The study, by London's St Bartholomew's Hospital, took place after a couple came back for IVF treatment, even though the male partner had changed.
The UK's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority denied ID fraud was a significant problem.
Our overwhelming feeling is that there are insufficient measures to protect the unit, the parents' legal rights, and most importantly the future welfare and well-being of the unborn child
Dr Luca Sabatini
It said there had only been a handful of ID fraud cases in the last three years.
Fort-five of the UK's 86 IVF clinics took part in the survey.
One in four clinics admitted they did not check patients' identity at all.
And more than half felt they did not have sufficient safeguards in place to prevent ID fraud.
HFEA rules say clinics should use signatures and referral letters as means of identifying patients.
Long-term treatment
But Dr Luca Sabatini, from Bart's, said photo IDs would help confirm people were who they said they were.
He said patients may not want to go back to the beginning of the treatment process again, even though one partner had changed.
In addition, a woman might want to use sperm from a younger man while maintaining that an older partner is the legal father
Dr Sabatini added: "Fraudulent behaviour may be fuelled by financial pressures, as the cost of treatment is high and public resources are limited.
"A patient may use a false identity in an attempt to have access to public funding from which he or she would otherwise be precluded.
"Or there may be more personal reasons, such as a change of partner during treatment."
He added: "A considerable length of time may pass between the couple's referral from the family doctor and the start of treatment, or during the fertility investigations which are necessary before treatment can commence.
"During this time a relationship break-up may occur, and one partner may try to continue the treatment with a different subject."
Legal consequences
And he warned that ID fraud could lead to legal disputes between IVF providers and deceived partners who discover they are not the genetic parents of their children.
This flawed and contradictory study does not reflect the day-to-day reality of UK fertility treatment
Stephanie Sullivan
Dr Sabatini warned that it could also be harmful for any resulting children not to known their true genetic heritage.
He added: "Although identify fraud among patients is still a relatively infrequent event, it has important medico-legal ramifications.
"Our overwhelming feeling is that there are insufficient measures to protect the unit, the parents' legal rights, and most importantly the future welfare and well-being of the unborn child."
The researchers plan to extend their work to look at clinics across Europe, and will carry out another survey in a year�s time to see if the situation has changed.
They say any regulations would need to be Europe-wide to prevent ID fraud in fertility tourism.
But Stephanie Sullivan, head of patient safety and clinical governance at the HFEA, said: "This flawed and contradictory study does not reflect the day-to-day reality of UK fertility treatment.
"In our frequent discussions, neither the clinics nor the HFEA have identified this as a significant ongoing issue.
"We provide clear guidance to all clinics that they should provide proper checks on identity and continue to do this throughout the course of treatment.
"Over the last three years UK clinics have provided more than 100,000 IVF treatments and there have been no more than 10 cases where identity has even been an issue."
Professor Paul Devroey, chairman of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, recomended that patients should be asked to produce photographic identity, and a hospital treatment card at every treatment visit.

The area I live in is true blue Liberal. There's no danger that the Liberal candidate might lose his seat. This is frustrating for me as I will be voting for the Labor candidate with the knowledge that she will not be elected.
I am very unhappy with the Howard government. I feel the country has gone backwards, as any dissent is now seen as a threat. We are encouraged to be fearful, not just about terrorism but for many other reasons too. I am also concerned about our very close relationship with the US. I very much want to see our troops out of Iraq. There have been many lies from Howard during his terms of office and one of them was about Iraq's weapons. If Howard gets re-elected we are considering moving to New Zealand
I am concerned about this government's climate change scepticism. An enormous amount of alternative energy technology and innovations developed in this country went overseas because the government wasn't interested in them. I do hope the Greens and Democrats do well in the Senate. I would like to see the Greens having the balance of power there. I would like to seen the Aboriginals receive more help in their communities by both parties. But sadly, knowing their election promises, that's not going to happen.
I do think Kevin Rudd will be good for the country. He has vitality and a fresh approach, which we desperately need. This election is different because Howard has announced he will be retiring half-way through the next parliamentary term. This will not effect the decision of the die-hard Liberals but some swinging voters are none too sure about having Peter Costello as a prime minister. I am a very political person and I am taking a great interest in the election. It is very important to me. If Howard gets re-elected we are considering moving to New Zealand.

NI GCSE grades improve slightly
Students are being encouraged to stay on in full time education
The first batch of this year's GCSE results are being revealed to thousands of students in Northern Ireland.
Grades from exams set by the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment, are being delivered on Tuesday. The second set, from the English boards used by some schools for some subjects, will not arrive until Thursday. The grades have improved slightly with just over 7% of papers awarded a grade A*. This is the first year of results for the new vocational GCSE and almost 50% scored enough for one of the top three grades.
It reflects the very strong effort that people put into education and the esteem that education has in the community
Alastair WalkerCCEA
For the first time in Northern Ireland, 16-year-olds from low income families will have an added incentive to stay on in full time education. If they decide to attend academic or vocational courses at either college or school, they could get up to �30 a week and if they complete the course well, they will get a series of �100 bonuses. The scheme was trialled in England where it increased the number of pupils staying in education and improved attendance levels. Alastair Walker, the head of education services with the CCEA examination body, said the good results were a reflection of teaching standards in Northern Ireland. "Though the results for the national figures don't come through until later in the week, we can confidently expect the results here will be better this year again," he said. "It has been the same pattern for a long time and I think it reflects the very high quality of teaching in Northern Ireland. "It reflects the very strong effort that people put into education and the esteem that education has in the community." E-mail this to a friend

Clegg 'has made Lib Dems grow up'
Nick Clegg has battled party activists over cuts
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has forced the party to "grow up" by facing the need to cut public spending, his spokesman has said.The party's annual conference is later expected to give the green light to Mr Clegg to go into the next election on a platform of spending cuts. If the party backs the policy document it will show how far it has come under his leadership, his spokesman said. It comes as a BBC poll suggests a third of voters could not identify Mr Clegg. Mr Clegg has angered many grassroots members - and senior figures such as Charles Kennedy - by talking of the need for "savage" spending cuts, possibly including its flagship policy of cutting university tuition fees. 'Austerity'The party is due to debate A Fresh Start for Britain - a policy document setting out the policy framework for the next manifesto, which Mr Clegg has said will end the days when the party fought elections with a long "shopping list" of policies. The party is expected to back the document, which contains broad principles rather than specific pledges. But Evan Harris, of the Federal Policy Committee, said his group would still have the final say over what goes in the manifesto - and he did not think it would not include a commitment to cutting university tuition fees. Only by focusing on children, through policies like cutting class sizes, can we tackle the entrenched disadvantage we have in Britain today
Nick Clegg
Nevertheless, Mr Clegg's aides said that by persuading the party to sign up to the principle of spending cuts he will have forced them to "grow up and join the general mood of austerity". Mr Clegg has been talking up his commitment to "giving children the best possible start in life" which he has said will be at the heart of the next manifesto. He said: "Only by focusing on children, through policies like cutting class sizes, can we tackle the entrenched disadvantage we have in Britain today." Huhne attackIt comes as a poll for BBC Newsnight suggests a third of voters have never heard of Mr Clegg. When asked what they thought of Mr Clegg, 36% said they had a favourable opinion, 28% said the opposite and 36% said they did not know who he was. Mr Clegg also received lukewarm support among those who voted Lib Dem at the 2005 general election. Just one in three believed he would make the best prime minister out of the main party leaders - compared to two-fifths who backed Tory leader David Cameron. Orb interviewed 1,056 adults from across the UK between September 11 and 14. Meanwhile the party's home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne made a hard-hitting attack on the Conservatives' decision to form a new Eurosceptic group in the European Parliament. He will say: "Cameron says he will stand up for gay people, but then allies himself with a Polish party of homophobes. "He says he cares about human rights, but then cuddles up to a Latvian party that celebrates Adolf Hitler's Waffen SS. "You can tell a lot about a party from the company it keeps."

Wilma batters the Mexican coast
Hurricane Wilma continues to pound the Mexico coastline, with huge storm surges reaching the third floor of some buildings in the Cancun resort area.
Torrential rain and winds of up to 140mph (225km/h) knocked over houses, upturned trees and flooded streets.
The hurricane has been downgraded to a category three storm, but is still considered to be dangerous.
It is expected to hover over the Yucatan peninsula for 30 to 36 hours at the weekend, say Mexican officials.

Much of the Mexican city of Cancun has been left without electricity and only a limited telephone service. Even buildings thought to be hurricane proof have been damaged in the storm. Many people there have been moved to emergency shelters, where conditions are said to be crowded and hot.
Officials say there are no reports of deaths so far.
Over in Cuba around 370,000 people have been forced to leave homes in the path of the hurricane.
And those living in Florida are evacuating the area ahead of the storm which is set to hit early next week. Weather officials say the eye - or centre - of the storm is very big, and the fact that Wilma is slow moving makes it more dangerous. Destruction
This year has seen one of the most destructive hurricane seasons.
Wilma is the 12th of the year, and only once since records began in 1851 have there been that many - in 1969.
Thousands of people have died in Central America already this month from landslides and floods following torrential rains brought by Hurricane Stan.
Hurricane Katrina caused devastation when it struck the southern United States in August.

Watson joins Oldham
Oldham Athletic have appointed former Barnsley number one David Watson as their new goalkeeping coach.
Twenty-eight-year-old Watson replaces ex-Latics keeper John Hallworth, who has left Boundary Park due to business commitments.
Watson had been coaching the goalkeepers at Northampton Town after being forced to retire as a player towards the end of last season.
The former England Under-21 international made 202 appearances for Barnsley before being injured in a game against Norwich City in September 1998.
He spent two-and-a-half years fighting to regain fitness before being forced to hang up his boots and concentrate on a coaching career.
His move to Oldham will see him re-united him with former Barnsley coach Mick Wadsworth, who is now in charge at Oldham.

Report
By Sam Lyon & Chris Bevan
09:00
Commentary
On this day 24 years ago, England faced Paraguay in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, running out 3-0 winners thanks to a brace from Gary Lineker and Peter Beardsley. That would do against Algeria in Cape Town tonight wouldn't it?
09:07
Commentary
Yep, later on this evening England target their first 2010 World Cup victory against an Algerian side ranked by most as outsiders in South Africa. Anything less than a convincing three points and you can bet the critics - not least German legend Franz Beckenbauer - will be on their backs faster than a turtle shell. Last Saturday's 1-1 draw against the USA was not good enough, apparently, so the time has come for Don Fabio's boys to step up. Nervous?
09:11
Commentary
I'm Sam Lyon and I'll be setting the scene for our very own Chris Bevan in Cape Town ahead of our first game of matchday eight - Germany v Serbia. There are more issues than the back catalogue of the Beano to discuss, so why don't you think about getting involved? You can text me on 81111 (UK) or +44 7786200666 (worldwide), Tweet me on Twitter @sampatricklyon or kick the chat off on 606 - so you've no excuses.
Twitter
From rm4rml: "The World Cup has finally sprung into action. Some wonderful, attacking football being played."
09:19
Commentary
Of course, it would be a lot easier to laugh off Franz Beckenbauer's stinging salvo if Germany hadn't have been so darn impressive in their opening game. But they were good. Very good. Australia may have played more than half an hour a man down, but even before that Germany were destroying them. Today, they face a step up in class against a Serbia side smarting from defeat to Ghana - and we might just get a clearer idea of how good they really are. Franz - we will be watching closely.
Twitter
Sports news correspondent James Pearce: "Cape Town on match day has such a different feel to Rustenburg last Saturday. So many England fans here it almost feels like Germany 2006."
09:27
Commentary
Your meat in the sandwich of Germany-Serbia and England-Algeria today, of course, is Slovenia against the United States - the 'other' game in England's Group C. A win for Slovenia in that one could have serious ramifications for England - a draw would then be good enough against Fabio Capello's side next Wedensday for Slovenia to top the group. Lining England up for a possible second round clash against the in-form Germans. Ouch.
SMS
From PoolieBoy: "We have seen a relatively young Mexican side beat France, now let's hope a young Serbia can come of age!"
SMS
From Gav, Edinburgh: "Good to see France stay true to form - they've only made it to the knockout stage once in World Cups outside of Europe!"
09:35
Commentary
How nice of PoolieBoy and Gav to bring me on to my next topic of conversation - just how bad France have been in South Africa. Rubbish against Uruguay in the dullest of dull matches last Friday, they were even worse against Mexico last night. Credit to Javier Aguirre's side, they were cracking, but Ramond Domenech can only be branded a failure if France go out, surely? A draw between Uruguay and Mexico in their last group game would be enough to eng the French's short World Cup now. And you thought England's draw with the US was worrying.
Twitter
From siddharth248: "Here's a stat for you... Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Italy - one of these four has always contested a World Cup final."
09:42
Commentary
While we're on the subject of France-Mexico - how good was Javier Hernandez last night? Sir Alex Ferguson reckons he's landed a peach of a player in signing him for Manchester United and on last night's evidence it's hard to disagree with him. Something of the Ole Gunnar Solskjaers about him if you ask me.
09:46
Commentary
BREAKING (ISH) NEWS
David James will get the nod ahead of Robert Green in goal for England tonight, say our sources. Thoughts?
Twitter
From mdlconnellan: "David James gets the nod for England - Fabio's righted the first wrong then, it seems."
SMS
From Lee, Sheffield: "The last time France scored a World Cup goal outside Europe was in a third-place play-off on 28th June 1986 - the day I was born."
606
From Rooney: "Mmmm... so much football."
09:54
Commentary
"But Sam, what has Robert Green done to deserve being dropped?" Well person I've just made up who has been hiding under a rock for a week, it was his costly error against the United States last Saturday that cost England an otherwise (just about) deserved win. Cue speculation all week that the West Ham keeper will be axed with David James preferred from here on in. If it's true - and Fabio Capello insists he does not name his team until two hours before kick-off, remember - I can't say I'm surprised. Though I would've like to have seen Joe Hart trusted from the outset in South Africa. Perhaps that's why I'm not England manager, though. That - and no other reason. Clearly.
SMS
From Mark, Ayr: "Talking of France, it's the Irish i feel for. It must hurt even more seeing how bad France have been and watching all their in-fighting. The Irish would have treated the World Cup like a once-in-lifetime opportunity, not like a scrap in a school playground."
Twitter
From andyj247: "World Cup has no room for sentiment - as proved by Capello by picking James over Green."
10:03
Commentary
By the way - anyone who argues against Joe Hart's selection in goal for England because of his lack of experience need look only as far as Germany for your argument to start losing water. Before their opener against Australia, none of Germany's three keepers in South Africa had ever played in a competitive international. Eat that.
Twitter
From strayjohno: "RE: Mark (09:54) actually, I feel great schadenfreude from seeing France implode so impressively."
SMS
From Sigrun in Surrey: "As a German who's been living in England for 7 years and who drew England in the work sweepstake I want both teams to come 1st so cheering on both teams today."
Ah - the allegiance-testing affect of the office sweepstake. Nice.
10:11
Commentary
For anyone who's interested - I drew Paraguay in our office sweepstake. I'm counting my winnings already.
10:17
Commentary
Now then, aside from France's capitulation, yesterday was memorable for two things - Argentina's hell-for-leather approach that bore fruit with a trouncing of South Korea, and the fact that Greece-Nigeria WASN'T an absolute snorefest. Miracles do happen. Jonathan Stevenson was in Johannesburg to watch Diego Maradona's side turn on the style - his conclusion? Argentina are the new Brazil. Stick that in your pipe and smoke it This-World-Cup-is-Boring merchants.
SMS
From Anon: "Re 10:03, yes Germany have won a game but we will see if a lack of experience comes back to haunt them. I have a feeling it will."
SMS
From Jack, Kingston Uni: "For the first time ever I thought I was in with a chance with my sweepstake team - Spain. Brilliant."
SMS
From Naveed, Hartlepool: "I've got Switzerland in the sweepstake, after their surprise win over Spain I'm now a confident man, bring on Chile!!"
10:29
Commentary
Guess who's waded into the England keeper debate? It's only wobbly-legged former Liverpool man Bruce Grobbelaar. He says Fabio Capello should plump for David James tonight because "there can be no excuses for the mistake Green made". As a few of you have pointed out, the good thing is that David James has NEVER made a mistake as a keeper. Ever.
Contributor
BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty
"England coach Fabio Capello will wake up to almost perfect footballing weather conditions on his 64th birthday here in Cape Town - but only a World Cup win against Algeria will give him cause for real celebration. Capello was in feisty mood facing the media last night - criticism of his selection methods were met with an offer to replace him in his job. No takers. England's choice of goalkeeper is the big selection question again - and Rob Green fumbled a couple of relatively easy efforts from goalkeeping coach Ray Clemence in training last night. Let's hope, if picked, he has got it out of his system."
Twitter
From BBC Sport's Dan Walker: "Is James the right custodian? Has Capello chosen with wisdom?"
SMS
From hatty: "If Kevin Prince Boateng plays for Ghana and his brother Jerome plays for Germany when the two sides meet next Wednesday. Will it be the first time ever that two brothers have played against each other in the World Cup?"
Yes. Or no. I'll, erm, check.
10:41
Commentary
So, whomever you support - or more to the point, whomever you've picked out of the hat in your office sweepstake - the time has come to sort out your matchday ritual and superstitions. May I suggest hopping to the toilet, wearing your jeans on backwards, and shouting "PIGEON" at the top of your voice at 13 minutes past every hour. Or, you could just do as the footballers do. Your choice my friends.
606
From Tim: "I got Algeria in the sweepstake..."
10:50
Commentary
Right, with just over 90 minutes to go until kick-off, how about we turn this chat right back around to the Germany-Serbia game? My friend and yours Chris Bevan will get your juices flowing with all the team news and match action in a bit, but let me hit you with some knowledge - Germany have played Serbia on 27 previous occasions (winning 16, drawing four and losing seven) and this, their seventh World Cup meeting, will equal the record number of meetings between two sides, held by Brazil-Sweden. I say this stuff to girls, you know.
SMS
From Tom, Cardiff: "I'm stuck in school whilst Germany are playing and they are my sweepstake pick! I might sneak the headphones in and try to watch it on the mobile."
Good lad, you know it makes sense.
SMS
From Fraser, Glasgow: "Absolutely anything can happen in the Germany v Serbia game. Will we see more German goals or will we see the necessary fight needed by Serbia to keep them in the World Cup?! Hopefully both in a 5-4 classic!"
10:57
Commentary
If you're wondering, by the way, what it South Africa - and each and every stadium in use at this World Cup - might look like through a lens, you will probably want to check out our Map and Venue guide, which is kind of like a map with a guide to the venues on it surprisingly. It's very nice.
606
From battyslittlelegs: "Do people think that Ballack will be able to get back into the Germany team once he's recovered from injury, or is he a done force now?"
11:05
Commentary
Right, the time has come for me to hand you over to Chris Bevan, who will count you down to Germany-Serbia kick-off and bring you all the action from the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. I'll be reporting on that game, and I reckon it might just be a classic. Send your complaints to Twitter @ sampatricklyon when it doesn't happen won't you? See ya!
11:18
Commentary
Thanks Sam. Yep, I'm Chris Bevan and I'm in Cape Town - which has been invaded by hordes of England fans in the last 24 hours. There's a cracking atmosphere here at the moment and everyone is looking forward to tonight's game - including me, and you too I hope...
11:28
Commentary
There wasn't much sympathy for the fate of the French in my part of town last night, but let's take our hats (sombreros surely?) off to Mexico - who are very easy on the eye. So were Germany in their opening game, so fingers crossed for more of the same against Serbia today - kick-off in Port Elizabeth is just an hour or so away.
Commentary
Germany v Serbia line-ups
Germany: 1-Manuel Neuer; 3-Arne Friedrich, 17-Per Mertesacker, 16-Philipp Lahm, 14-Holger Badstuber; 6-Sami Khedira, 7-Bastian Schweinsteiger, 8-Mesut Ozil, 13-Thomas Mueller; 10-Lukas Podolski, 11-Miroslav Klose
Serbia: 1-Vladimir Stojkovic; 3-Aleksandar Kolarov, 6-Branislav Ivanovic, 5-Nemanja Vidic, 20-Neven Subotic, 17-Milos Krasic, 10-Dejan Stankovic, 22-Zdravko Kuzmanovic, 14-Milan Jovanovic, 18-Milos Ninkovic, 15-Nikola Zigic.
Referee: Alberto Undiano (Spain)
11:35
Commentary
There's been a lot of debate over who should start in goal for England against Algeria later and here's some news on that front. BBC Sport's news correspondent Dan Roan understands that David James will replace the much-maligned Robert Green.
Contributor
BBC Sport's Dan Roan
via Twitter: "Green exclusion tonight likely to signal end of his international career. Hart long-term successor to James now."
11:40
Commentary
The other big decision for England coach Fabio Capello ahead of the Algeria game is who to start up front alongside Wayne Rooney - Emile Heskey or Jermain Defoe. I spoke to Lee Dixon last night for his tactical view of how England will try to get the win that everyone is expecting.
11:45
Commentary
I meant to say this earlier, but give this page a manual refresh if you haven't already - that way you know who I am. I want to know who you are too, or at least what you think about today's games and how the tournament is shaping up overall. Text me on 81111 (UK) or +44 7786200666 (worldwide), I'm on Twitter @chrisbevan_bbc or you can always get involved on 606. 11:54
Commentary
Germany v Serbia team news
Unsurprisingly, Germany coach Joachim Loew goes with the same line-up that routed Australia 4-0 last week against Serbia, resisting the temptation to rotate one or two of his first XI. Serbia coach Raddy Antic, though, does change things following his side's opening game-defeat to Ghana, opting for Neven Subotic in the absence of suspended central defender Aleksandar Lukovic and Milos Ninkovic as a surprise choice to start alongside striker Marko Pantelic. Zdravko Kuzmanovic for Nenad Milijas is the other change.
SMS
From Norm: "Re 11:28. How rare, Chris, to have an Englishman hoping for some flowing German football. I almost detected some sincerity in your statement!"
Strictly speaking, I'm actually Welsh... but parents/grandparents mean I'm eligible to play for England, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland (I'm still available if anyone needs me). I think we all should admire how Germany are playing though - hope they keep it up too.
Commentary
Germany coach Joachim Loew
"Since they lost their first match they are even more dangerous in the second game. They are like a boxer who takes a first blow, they are poised
to hit back. Their coach (Radomir Antic) has talked about honour, character,
that tomorrow's game is the match of the year. I know the Serbian culture, they are strong fighters and are perfectly able to deliver on their promises."
606
From the_fosse: "I’m going to call this early. World Cup shock, 1-0 Serbia."
Quite early... but very brave.
Commentary
Serbia coach Raddy Antic
"We are facing the team that has shown the best football so far, in my opinion. I was impressed with their game against Australia. We know we have to rise to the occasion. That's the trademark of real champions. This upcoming match is really a historic match for us. But Germany should also inspire us to regain the passion and joy in our game. We were too tight against Ghana, we failed mentally. All our players have to raise their level."
SMS
From Craig Levein: "Re Norm's text, can you play centre-half?"
I'm more of a left-back Craig, but I'm versatile - I'm just as bad wherever I play.
Contributor
BBC Sport's Alan Shearer
"Germany have started this tournament very well. You have to take in consideration that they have only played Australia but you can only beat who is in front of you and it was a great performance with a lot of goals. They were convincing and they made a real statement."
SMS
From Ash in Leeds: "Can't see Serbia being able to stop Germany, they looked poor against Ghana, and Germany look such a strong unit."
12:25
Commentary
The players have just emerged from the tunnel at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. Sadly, the ground is far from full - again.
12:29
Commentary
Luton Town (and Manchester City) fans will remember Serbia coach Raddy Antic from his time in English football in the early 1980s... he's also managed a couple of teams in Spain you may have heard of? A big day for him today, though: lose this and Serbia's World Cup could be all but over. Kick-off is moments away...
12:30
KICK-OFF
Germany v Serbia
Here we go. Germany get us under way on a sunny day in Port Elizabeth.
3 mins
Commentary
This is promising. Serbia have not exactly been shy in the first couple of minutes. Milan Jovanovic has had a header (comfortably) saved and Dejan Stankovic dragged a long-range shot wide.
SMS
From Nick from Liverpool: "Miroslav Klose to score another couple today - he is criminally underrated in my opinion."
6 mins
Commentary
Jurgen Klinsmann told me this week how Germany like to get the ball forward as early as possible - he said they play in a 'Premier League' style. They've just had their first decent spell of possession but Philipp Lahm's final ball was too strong for Mesut Ozil. Looking forward to seeing more of him today too.
8 mins
Commentary
Germany's first real sight of goal. Nemanja Vidic clears a cross, but only as far as Lukas Podolski. He has time and space on the edge of the area but slices his shot and misses the target.
12 mins
Commentary
Serbia are more patient - or pedestrian - coming forward. Still, they are doing alright so far. Milos Krasic crosses for Milos Ninkovic who arrives in the left-hand corner of the area to smash a first-time shot over the bar.
13 mins
YELLOW CARD
Our first booking of the day. Germany's Miroslav Klose chases back to try to win possession but clips Branislav Ivanovic. More clumsy than anything else.
15 mins
Commentary
I already like the look of Milos Krasic down the right flank for Serbia and he has just won a free-kick in a dangerous position on that side of the area. Milan Jovanovic floats it over to the back post but nobody is able to make contact with it. Chance gone.
20 mins
YELLOW CARD
Another booking.. Two of them, actually - both for Serbia. Branislav Ivanovic catches Lukas Podolski late, quickly followed by a lunge by Aleksandar Kolarov on Thomas Mueller (I think).
22 mins
YELLOW CARD
Not many chances so far, but plenty of yellow cards - two apiece now. Germany's Sami Khedira tangles with Milos Krasic and referee Alberto Undiano is reaching for his pocket again...
Contributor
BBC Radio 5 live's Pat Nevin
"The bookings Serbia are racking up are needless. Totally needless."
28 mins
Commentary
It's not happening for either side at the moment. Germany's Thomas Mueller has massively over-hit a couple of crosses from the right and Serbia just can't keep the ball outside of their own half. No more bookings to tell you about either, which makes a change I suppose.
Twitter
From HibaMS: "The game's slow pace is driving me crazy!!"
34 mins
YELLOW CARD
Serbia's first effort on goal for a little while. Philipp Lahm becomes the fifth man to be shown yellow after a wild tackle catches Milos Krasic on the edge of the area. Aleksandar Kolarov steps up to take the free-kick... and curls it a couple of yards wide. I think Manuel Neuer had it covered anyway.
37 mins
RED CARD
Crazy. But it was bound to happen, with the number of yellow cards that Spanish referee is Alberto Undiano has been flashing. Miroslav Klose catches Dejan Stankovic: It's innocuous, but it's his second booking - and it means he's off.
38 mins
GOAL
Germany 0-1 Serbia It's all happening in Port Elizabeth. Germany, still rocking from Miroslav Klose's red card, are now behind too. Milos Krasic crosses, Nikola Zigic knocks it down and Milan Jovanovic is all alone to turn the ball home from close range. Germany are in big trouble now.
43 mins
Commentary
I'm told that Miroslav Klose is the first German to be sent off in a World Cup match since Carsten Ramelow against Cameroon in 2002. It will be very interesting to see how they react to this...
45 mins
Commentary
Germany may only have 10 men but they have just come within inches of an equaliser. After a couple of corners are cleared, Mesut Ozil's cross is punched away by Vladimir Stojkovic - but only as far as Sami Khedira, who slams his shot against the bar.
HALF-TIME

"We have got a really fussy referee who has ruined the game for Germany. The red card completely changed the face of the match and Group D is wide open if this score stays the same."
13:22
Commentary
By the way, Serbia's Milan Jovanovic, who is set to join Liverpool later this summer, celebrated his goal by jumping in the (dry) moat that separates the pitch from the stands. I think he quite enjoyed that too!
Twitter
From optajoe: "11 - Spanish referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco gave 11 red cards in 17 games in La Liga last season. Bullish."
Twitter
From randalthor1812: "Worst referee so far in WC ruined a potentially great game , out of 6 bookings 2 may be justified, just awful."

Serbia get the second half under way... no changes from either side yet.

Commentary
Germany are the first to get forward but it's not a clear-cut chance. Bastian Schweinsteiger has the ball on the left-hand side of the area and fizzes a fierce ball across the face of goal - not sure whether it was a cross or a shot... but it was well wide anyway.

Germany are definitely coming forward with more intent so far in this half, but then they have to, don't they? Bastian Schweinsteiger tries a snap-shot from the edge of the area that Vladimir Stojkovic makes a bit of a meal of... he can't catch it but he keeps it out so I suppose that's good enough.

YELLOW CARD
We hadn't seen a yellow card for a while but normal service has just been resumed by referee Alberto Undiano. Neven Subotic is booked after bringing down Mesut Ozil.

PENALTY
missed by Germany
Lukas Podolski has just gone close twice in quick succession for Germany but he's just wasted a golden chance to level. Referee Alberto Undiano points to the spot after Nemanja Vidic handles a cross from the right... but Podolski's low spot-kick is weak and easily saved by Vladimir Stojkovic
67 mins
HITS THE WOODWORK
Germany are living very dangerously indeed. Serbia play in Milan Jovanovic after a neat build-up, and he picks his spot from the edge of the area - but sees the ball cannon back off the post. Unlucky.
69 mins
SUBSTITUTION
It's change o'clock. A double substitution by Germany sees Marko Marin and Cacau come on for Mesut Ozil and Thomas Mueller. Serbia have replaced with Milos Ninkovic with the more defensive-minded Gojko Kacar.

"Thomas Mueller's done well and looked very dangerous. But he's shattered."

HITS THE WOODWORK
Nikola Zigic, who will be in the Premier League with Birmingham next season, should have just sealed it for Serbia - he rises highest to meet a cross from the right but can't keep his header down and it shaves the top of the bar.
SMS
Daz from Essex: "Germans missing penalties, whatever next - free-flowing football from England?"
77 mins
YELLOW CARD
The only previous penalty miss for Germany in regulation play was by Uli Hoeness in 1974 against Poland. It looks like it could be very costly today too - time is running out for them now. By the way, Bastian Schweinsteiger has become the latest player to have been shown yellow - he was booked for bundling over Aleksandar Kolarov.
80 mins
Commentary
A couple more changes to tell you about. Mario Gomez is on for Holger Badstuber in Germany's final roll of the dice - they have just three men at the back now - and Serbia have also made all three changes with Radosav Petrovic replacing Zdravko Kuzmanovic and Danko Lazovic on for goalscorer Milan Jovanovic.
84 mins
Commentary
Germany are getting more and more desperate, and leaving more and more space at the back. Serbia should take advantage on the break but Radosav Petrovic's pass for Milos Krasic is a poor one... the ball runs out of play.
86 mins
Commentary
Poor Lukas Podolski has now had six shots on goal this afternoon - all of them off target - as well as seeing that penalty saved. His latest effort swerved away from goal after he let fly from the left-edge of the area.
89 mins
Commentary
Serbia have got a ridiculous amount of space when they break forward... and men over too. They cannot make it count, though, because Milos Krasic overhits his cross despite having a couple of team-mates to aim for.
SMS
Dan from Luton: "Germany being opened up way to easily in wide areas. Serbia should have sealed this game by now!"
90 mins
INJURY TIME
Philipp Lahm hoists a cross into the box but it is easy for Vladimir Stojkovic to collect. Ten-man Germany have three minutes of injury time to find an equaliser but they look tired, and short of ideas too.
92 mins
Commentary
Serbia survive a spell where the ball was pinging around their area - the referee blows for a foul on Dejan Stankovic, leaving Germany boss Joachim Loew to take his frustration out on a water bottle in his technical area.
FULL-TIME
Germany 0-1 Serbia
Wow. A famous win for Serbia that blows Group D wide open - they join Germany and Ghana on three points. The Germans, who had Miroslav Klose sent off for two softish bookings - are left to rue that missed penalty... they never really looked like equalising after that.
Twitter
From michaelgrayer: "This shows you can never jump to conclusions based on a single game."
14:34
Commentary
That sets up Group D very nicely indeed for Saturday's game beteen Ghana and Australia but it is Group C that we will focus our attention on for the rest of today. First up, Jonathan Stevenson will take you through Slovenia v the United States, followed by England's clash with Algeria. Hold on to your hats... I'll see you again tomorrow.
By Sam Lyon
Serbia brought 10-man Germany crashing back down to earth with a narrow win in Port Elizabeth that blows qualification from Group D wide open.
An opening-game rout of Australia had German fans and critics predicting a run deep into the World Cup tournament, with national newspaper Bild declaring: "We're going to blow you all away".But Serbia were always likely to prove a different proposition to a weak Australia side forced to play more than half an hour a man down, and after frontman Miroslav Klose had been harshly dismissed for two bookings in the first half, Germany failed to rally sufficiently to force an equaliser against Radomir Antic's stubborn side.Liverpool-bound Milan Jovanovic proved the match-winner with a 35th-minute volley, but in truth the result was as much down to the Germans' poor finishing - not least from Lukas Podolski who missed a penalty amid a hatful of chances.And referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco of Spain played no small part in influencing proceedings with a series of baffling decisions and yellow cards.It means Germany, Serbia and Ghana all stand on three points ahead of the Africans' second group match against the Aussies on Saturday.Germany, though, will feel aggrieved at a result that almost entirely centred around Klose's dismissal.For the first half hour before that, in the face of a Serbian defence far more disciplined than the Australian backline had been on Sunday, Germany were patient and measured in attack, Podolski flashing a volley narrowly wide and playmaker Mesut Ozil again impressing.But just a minute after referee Mallenco brandished a second yellow card to Klose - both for innocuous trips - Serbia grabbed what proved to be their winner.The lively Milan Krasic produced a fine cross from the right that was nodded down by Birmingham City new-boy Nikola Zigic and slammed home from close range by Jovanovic.Thereafter, with Serbia dropping deeper and deeper despite their numerical advantage, Germany controlled possession and had a series of chances to level the scores.Sami Khedira slammed a vicious shot against the bar 16 yards out, while Podolski wasted two glorious passes from Ozil when he clipped the first wide and the second into the side-netting.Neither chance was as good as the next, though, when he saw his tame penalty saved by Serbia keeper Vladimir Stojkovic after Nemanja Vidic's inexplicable handball in the box.It was only Germany's second penalty miss in a World Cup outside of a shoot-out, their first by Uli Hoeness in 1974, and it proved crucial.Playing on the counter, Serbia - much improved from a display against Ghana that did the talent in their side no justice - twice hit the woodwork, with Jankovic curling left-footed on to the foot of Manuel Neuer's post and Zigic heading on to the bar from another Krasic cross.Unlike Germany, though, they were not made to rue their profligacy, seeing out a win that gives Antic's side a real chance of reaching the second round.As for Joachim Loew's side, their first World Cup group-stage defeat since 1986 means only a victory over Ghana next Wednesday will guarantee them a place in the last 16.
