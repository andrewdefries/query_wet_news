Kenyan girls flee mutilation
Kenyan girls should be protected by the police
As least 100 Kenyan girls are in hiding from their parents as they seek to escape forced Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).
Churches in south-western Kenya have been sheltering them after they ran away from their homes. BBC News Online has been told that there are some 700 others in the south-west alone, who have not yet run away but are in dispute with their parents who want them to undergo FGM.
FGM, traditionally known as circumcision, remains widespread in much of rural Kenya, even though it was outlawed among young girls in 2001, with girls above the age of 16 able to make their own decision.
Help
Agnes Yapan, a co-ordinator for the women's NGO, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake, which campaigns against forced FGM, is helping to look after 33 of the girls in Narok.
She told BBC News Online that the authorities were not responding to their requests, and they had only been helped by churches and sympathetic pastors.
"We would like some assistance. If we can get some help we will be able to look after them properly," she said
The girls aged between about 13 and 18, go to school or are training in the daytime. They then stay together in church rooms in the evening, using church-supplied bedding. She said there was a similar situation in nearby areas.
"No-one helped them run away. They know we have been teaching against the dangers of FGM"

Circumcision voices
Kenyan girls tell of fleeing genital mutilation
She said as soon as a girl was circumcised "she is given up to her husband". "We want them to get their eduction."
Many of the girls fled their homes as long ago as December, at the start of the long holidays.
Secretive
Maendeleo say that Narok and Kisii districts in the west have the highest cases of FGM in the country and a lot more effort is required to contain the practice in these areas. FGM remains widespread in rural Kenya
Some 14 countries in Africa have now banned FGM. Campaigners have sought to replace the traditional practice with a coming of age ceremony. Executive Director of the Centre for Human Rights and Democracy Ken Wafula said recently that most communities in Kenya practising FGM were now doing it in secret to avoid arrest. He said his organisation was visiting various primary schools to educate young girls against the dangers of the rite and encouraging the formation of anti-FGM clubs in schools. According to a 1998 survey in Kenya, 38% of women aged between 15 and 49 years old were estimated to have undergone FGM.
The World Health Organisation estimates that about 130 million girls and women in 28 countries undergo some form of female circumcision. Thursday, was the first UN-backed International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation and Other Harmful Traditional Practices. WATCH/LISTEN

How UK 'turned its back' on older workers
Analysis
By Julian Knight
Personal finance reporter, BBC News
Employment rates for the over 50s fell for two decades
Lose your job after the age of 50 - or even 40 in some industries - and you may have a fight on your hands to find a new one. Stories are legion of older workers leaving employment never to return.
In fact, according to official figures, some 2.8 million people over the age of 45 are without paid work in the UK. All this despite longer lives, an ageing population, a tight labour market and, from 1 October, the introduction of new laws to combat age discrimination in the workplace.
Why is it that so many people in their 50s and 60s are without work?
These stereotypes have led to many employers seeing older candidates as only good for 'being there' jobs such as door people or receptionists
Hilary Metcalfe, NIESR
Quick guide: Age Discrimination "It's largely a mix of people being discouraged through ageism and others unable to work due to ill health," Hilary Metcalfe, senior research fellow at National institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), said.
"Long-standing stereotypes lie behind the ageism problem."
Typical stereotypes of older workers include inability to adapt to new technology, lacking creativity and being inflexible, hard to train and too cautious for the cut and thrust of modern business.
On the upside - and it's not much of one - older workers are seen by firms as more reliable than their younger counterparts.
"These stereotypes have led to many employers seeing older candidates as only good for 'being there' jobs such as door people or receptionists. Relatively low paid and unskilled," Ms Metcalfe added.
Discrimination
It seems ageism is at its most acute in newer industries; where instead of life beginning at 40, careers can come to a juddering halt.
"Media, advertising and IT - the newer the industry, the more likely to discriminate," Ms Metcalfe said.
In addition, as far as job-seeking goes, younger workers often have a trump card compared to their older counterparts - more academic qualifications.
"Around 6% of people went to university in the 1970s, but now it is 40%," Steve Williams, head of equality services at ACAS, said. "Therefore, any firm specifying that a recruit must be a graduate could be considered to be discriminating on the grounds of age because they are instantly targeting the young.
"Ask for appropriate qualifications by all means but there has to be some trade-off with relevant experience," Mr Williams added.
Culture change
Pension funds were used by both the private and public sectors to restructure the age of the workforce
Steve Williams, Acas
It was all so different 30 years ago. Back in the early 1970s, nine out of 10 men over the age of 50 were employed. Many of these workers were in blue-collar industrial jobs - the very jobs that disappeared over the next two decades as British industry shrank.
But the cull of older workers, which started in blue-collar industries in the 1970s, spread into white-collar occupations over the next two decades. "A culture sprang up of people taking redundancy and early retirement in their 50s," Mr Williams said.
"Pension funds were used by both the private and public sectors to restructure the age of the workforce...being young equated with being an asset." Anyone who can remember the 1980s and early 1990s can recall in the lexicon of the time that industry was meant to get "lean" and "fit" in order to compete and survive.
For "lean" and "fit" you could easily transpose "young" or "vigorous". Youth therefore equalled competitiveness. By promoting fresh faces, UK business could stand tall once again after the economic torpor of the 1970s.
But getting rid of so many older workers could have unforeseen consequences.
"The thought seemed to be that these workers had their chance and it was time for them to move on," Ms Metcalfe said. "Interestingly, as the economy improved in the 1990s, many of these firms and organisations found that they had too few experienced staff, there was a real skill shortage but the reaction wasn't to significantly reintroduce older workers."
If they can't find work at all then there is often an serious impact on the individual's mental well-being
Lucy Anderson, TUC
Devastating
As for those shown the door, the effects could be devastating.
"Age is the most significant way that people are discriminated against," Lucy Anderson, TUC senior policy officer, told BBC News.
"In managerial and professional jobs, it is very hard to get back if you are made redundant in your 40s and beyond. "People are downgraded or lose job security by having to take freelance work. If they can't find work at all then there is often a serious impact on the individual's mental well being," Ms Anderson added.
Ageism, it seems, does not just apply to hiring and firing but also in access to training.
"Many workplaces have their own training programmes, ostensibly open to any age, yet they tend to be targeted at younger workers," Mr Williams said.
"Employers seem relaxed about this but it is amazing that some subscribe to the stereotype that older workers can't adapt yet they don't make an effort to train them.
In the past decade there has been a slight rise in employment rates
"The fact of the matter is that organisations are wasting enormous amount of talents and skill...ageism amounts to marginalisation and harassment," he added.
New rules
On 1 October new rules come into force effectively banning age discrimination in the workplace applying to staff under age 65.
No longer will firms be able to deny an interview, refuse a job offer, deny training or sack someone under 65 on the grounds of age.
Experts have said that the rules will not lead to revolution overnight, reversing at a stroke the decline in workplace participation amongst the over 50s.
Instead a slow cultural change is on the cards.
"The benefits to the wider economy of increasing workplace participation to 80% of over 50s could be enormous. It will help us pay for our pensions for a start," Ms Anderson said.
This is borne out by the findings of the government's own Pensions Commission which said that a later state pension age and boosting private saving would only solve the pensions crisis if more people could work for longer.
And the knowledge gained from having more older people in the workforce could also boost UK competitiveness, experts say.
"Keep older workers in the mainstream, apply their learning to the way the organisation is going and you can learn from past mistakes without having to constantly reinvent the wheel," Mr Williams said. "Perhaps, this will go a long way to undermining the negative stereotypes."

Chaplin's granddaughter acts up
Oona Chaplin is named after her grandmother (photo by Andy Thomas)
Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter is to play the famous film star in a production at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival next month.
Oona Chaplin will dress up in the familiar baggy suit complete with moustache, bowler hat and cane in an alternative version of Shakespeare's play, A Midsummer Night's Dream.
The 17-year-old will play the role of her grandfather as Bottom in the Gordonstoun school production.
Chaplin said she was hesitant about taking the part at first but was persuaded to do it after a discussion with her mother, actress Geraldine Chaplin.
"I have grown up with him all around and feel I know how he would act. But I would not dare to copy his style for no good reason. My mum explained how it would work in the play," she said.
She has already peformed the role at her school, where she received rapturous applause from the audience.
Chaplin is named after her grandmother Oona, who married Chaplin when she was 18 and he was 57.

Gold cautions Yeung on price cut
Yeung wants to reward fans after a drawn-out takeover process Outgoing Birmingham chairman David Gold has warned new owner Carson Yeung that reducing ticket prices could lead to the club being relegated.Yeung has cut the price of a ticket for the Barclays Premier League visit of Manchester City on 1 November. Gold told BBC Radio 5 live: "The model for reducing prices doesn't work. In the event that you cut your prices in half you don't double your attendance. "Fans will love him but he will get relegated because it doesn't work." Gold, who is stepping down after 16 years at St Andrew's, added: "Often fans say if you cut your prices you will fill the stadium - it is not true. When the last Carson Yeung attempt to buy the club failed it destabilised the club to an extent that Steve Bruce left, understandably, and we got relegated
Outgoing Birmingham chairman David Gold
"What I have been lobbying for through the Football Association, and particularly when I was in the Football League, was for prices to be cut universally, across the board, every club reducing their prices. "You can't do it individually and Carson will find, if he keeps doing it individually, he will get relegated. "If all your competitors cut their prices it's fine, it does work. "But what will happen is the other clubs won't cut their prices and they will get promoted or not relegated, so the model doesn't work." Yeung first attempted to take over the club two seasons ago but a potential deal collapsed and Birmingham were subsequently relegated.
606: DEBATE
I hope the new board are given an extended chance to put us in a position that we are comfortable with
onlyme35
Gold accepts he and fellow owner David Sullivan must accept their share of the blame for that, but feels the club is now in good shape as it is handed over. He said: "One shouldn't blame Carson Yeung, it was the recession that helped the collapse of the deal two years ago. "But it was that that got the football club relegated. When the last Carson Yeung attempt to buy the club failed it destabilised the club to an extent that [manager] Steve Bruce left, understandably, and we got relegated. "We did genuinely believe at the time the deal would go through. Our judgement was wrong so you could argue it was the board's fault. I would take the criticism. "But we did redeem ourselves and by the same token you must commend us for getting Birmingham City promoted the following season."

Rangers sign up Bardsley on loan
Bardsley has had loan spells with Barnsley and Royal Antwerp
Rangers have taken Manchester United defender Phil Bardsley on loan until the end of the year.
The 21-year-old right-back joins Old Trafford team-mate Lee Martin, who made a similar switch to Ibrox last week.
Bardsley spent the end of last season on loan at Burnley and featured in United's pre-season friendlies against Celtic, Porto and Seville.
He made his United debut in December 2003 and has featured 17 times for the first team.

Wildcats overpower Tigers
Castleford 2-38 Wakefield Trinity
Wakefield coasted past Castleford's inexperienced and untested youngsters to claim the spoils in the annual Boxing Day friendly.
The Wildcats, with the spine of their first team on duty, won the game inside half an hour after racing into a 16-2 lead.
Australian Ben Rauter, signed only days earlier, marked his first appearance with a second half try.
Castleford new boys Gareth Handford and Australian Mark Lennon had little chance to shine.
The Wildcats cut loose inside four minutes when Paul March's high kick forced an error from home winger Tom Saxton and trialist Richard Smith was on hand to touch down.
Winging it: Sovatabua scored a 23rd minute try
Ten minutes later March was again heavily involved in Wakefield's second try, working a superb run-around with loose forward Tom Haughey to give centre Ben Westwood a walk-in.
A Lennon penalty was all the Tigers had to show from the opening quarter. They fell further behind on 23 minutes when winger Waisale Sovatabua took Smith's pass to fend off Saxton and cross in the corner.
They underlined their superiority inside five minutes of the second half when Rauter, who only came on at half-time, took a Sovatabua pass to plunge over, a try improved by Graham Law.
Substitute Gareth Ellis barged over from Haughey's break on 62 minutes, then Chris Feather slipped a tackle to race in from 35 metres five minutes later.
Westwood claimed his second touchdown eight minutes from the end to cap a satisfying display from the Wildcats.

What is Britain's role in Mali?
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement
Yesterday, Foreign Secretary William Hague said "there is no all-military solution to the problem" in Mali. He claims the answer to how to improve the situation in Mali could possibly be found by looking at the role Britain and the international community had played over the past year in Somalia. Speaking to the Today programme's Evan Davis, he said it was important to address the situation in Mali, to prevent it from becoming a failed state, as Somalia was for more than 20 years. He said that Somalia was "a good model here to think about, although we mustn't generalise too much from one country to another... where we have managed... to bring about, with the strong Somali support, a legitimate government in Somalia." He highlighted that now Somalia "enjoys a greater degree of support among the local people, [and has] strong African forces engaged in fighting terrorist organisations, funded by the European Union." "It's the African forces that do the actual fighting and manoeuvring there [with] strong humanitarian and diplomatic support from the rest of the world," he added. Get in touch with Today via email
