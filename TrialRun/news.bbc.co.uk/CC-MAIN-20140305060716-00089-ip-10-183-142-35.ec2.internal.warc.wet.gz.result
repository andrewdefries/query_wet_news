Venezuela step closer to Mercosur
The Brazilian president is visiting Venezuela this week
Brazil's Senate Foreign Relations Committee has approved Venezuela's request to join the South American trade bloc Mercosur.The committee voted by 12 to five in favour of Venezuela's application, and the proposal will now go before the Senate to gain full approval. Paraguay's parliament must also approve Venezuela's membership before it will be allowed to join Mercosur. Venezuela has been trying to join the bloc for three years. The country officially teamed up with Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay as part of their Mercosur trading bloc in July 2006. But, so far, its membership has only been approved by the Uruguayan, Argentine and Venezuelan parliaments. Correspondents say a rejection by Brazil's Foreign Relations Committee would have been severely embarrassing for the Brazilian President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is visiting Venezuela this week. Mercosur was established in March 1991.

Dutch press EU to adopt passenger scanners
At Schiphol passengers can choose to be frisked or go through a scanner
Dutch airport authorities want the EU to make passenger scanners mandatory, arguing that they might have stopped a man who tried to blow up a US airliner.Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport has 17 of the microwave security scanners, but their use remains voluntary because of continuing privacy concerns. Schiphol now has software to scan the image, an airport spokeswoman said, "so we think the privacy issue is solved". A Nigerian man has been charged with trying to blow up a transatlantic jet. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, targeted a Detroit-bound flight from Amsterdam with explosives hidden in his clothes, US authorities say. He was tackled aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 as it approached Detroit on Friday. 'Rules were followed'Mirjam Snoerwang of Schiphol Airport told the BBC that check-in staff at Schiphol had followed the established procedure and "the first result shows we didn't make mistakes".

Mr Abdulmutallab was a transit passenger and did not go through a security scanner. The passenger list was transmitted to the US authorities "in accordance with standard procedures," the Dutch National Coordinator for Counterterrorism (NCTB) said. The security check took place "according to the rules and no irregularities were observed," the NCTB added. Ms Snoerwang said Schiphol was awaiting more information from the US investigation to see whether the scanner would have picked up the explosives that Mr Abdulmutallab had concealed under his clothes. Schiphol has scanners made by US-based L-3 Communications Holdings Inc, each costing 100,000 euros (£90,000). The microwave scanner is not as powerful as the full-body X-ray machines used by border control agencies, which can detect items such as drugs concealed inside the body. Invasion of privacy?Schiphol's scanners are only used for European flights, and the US "still has to agree on the privacy issue," Ms Snoerwang said. "But this incident may make that quicker," she added.

Privacy watchdogs have raised concerns that the scanners could expose too much of a person's body and that the images could be viewed by airport staff. Privacy concerns have delayed adoption of the scanners at EU airports. Last month, the EU Transport Commissioner, Antonio Tajani, told Euro MPs that further testing was required to determine how such scanners might be operated. "It is the Commission's view that the application of imaging technology as means of security screening at airports must be optional and passengers must be given the choice between them and physical control by airport screeners," he told the European Parliament. He said the scanners currently in use "are demonstration means and cannot replace mandatory passenger screening through hand searches". In October last year MEPs passed a resolution which said body scanners "cannot be considered mere technical measures relating to aviation security, but have a serious impact on the fundamental rights of citizens". They asked the Commission to assess the scanners' impact on fundamental rights, health and travel costs. Since the Christmas Day bombing attempt passengers on US-bound flights have been frisked before boarding and restricted to one item of hand luggage. US-bound flights from London's airports have been delayed by two or three hours.

Performance management
All teachers will have annual appraisals
There are two aspects to the changes the government is introducing this autumn for teachers in England. There are very similar proposals for Wales. Those who volunteer, and meet the criteria, can move onto a new, higher pay scale. It is this aspect of the changes that people normally mean when they talk about performance-related pay. But all teachers will be subject to a new system of performance management and a new salary structure which includes annual performance targets and assessments. Targets
From the academic year starting in autumn 2000, teachers in England and Wales have to agree performance targets with their line managers. In smaller schools, the manager or "team leader" for all staff will probably be the head teacher. In larger schools it could be another member of the management team. The idea was originally intended to start in 1999 but pressure from unions resulted in the government postponing the process by a year. There are expected to be between three and seven targets which are supposed to be "challenging" - "neither too comfortable nor dauntingly unrealistic" is how the official guidance puts it. Progress test
Most controversially they must include at least one about pupil progress - either of individuals, groups or the whole class. But teachers are being told they will normally be expected to get an annual pay increment - over and above any across-the-board pay rise - unless their performance is assessed as being unsatisfactory. Schools will be able to reward "exceptionally good performance" by giving a teacher a double salary step.
There are nine basic salary steps, ranging from �15,141 (most honours graduates start on the second rung, at �16,050) to �23,958. At this point classroom teachers normally hit a ceiling beyond which they cannot earn more without taking on administrative or managerial responsibilities. Ministers have said repeatedly they think this is wrong and want to reward the best teachers who choose to stay in front of the class - hence the biggest change they are introducing, which lets teachers volunteer to "cross the threshold".

DUP warning over IRA disarmament
Ian Paisley said the IRA has done nothing to meet its obligations
The Democratic Unionists have said that they would require a "prolonged period of assessment" to determine whether the IRA has given up its armed campaign.
After meeting Tony Blair, DUP leader Ian Paisley said the IRA had made a statement but had done nothing about keeping their obligations. He called for "total decommissioning that everyone can be satisfied with".
After a separate meeting with Mr Blair, Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams said he thought devolution could be restored soon.
Mr Adams added he believed that the outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement would be implemented "in the period ahead".
Thursday's talks in London between the two party leaders and Prime Minister Blair are the first since last week's IRA statement in which it said it was ending its armed campaign. QUICK GUIDE
Northern Ireland conflict
Mr Paisley said: "We are not going to have any discussions about devolution until the requirements Mr Blair set out are fulfilled by the IRA," he said.
His deputy, Peter Robinson, added: "It will take a long period of time to make sure that they are gone and they are gone for good."
Mr Paisley said he had presented a list of demands to the prime minister in what he described as a "blunt" meeting.
Mr Blair and Mr Adams met in Downing Street
These included assurances relating to the government's announcement that it planned to disband the three home-based battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment.
After Sinn Fein met with Mr Blair, the party's Martin McGuiness said the DUP had to "regain their nerve" and recognise they had a major contribution to make to the peace process.
"The ball game has changed, changed completely and I think forever," Mr McGuinness said.
"At some stage the DUP will have to respond to an agenda which is very clearly moving on without them." Penalties
On Wednesday, the DUP said they had set out a series of time penalties which would apply in response to "any further concessions from the government to republicans". They said they believed devolution would not return for a minimum of two years.
The Northern Ireland-based battalions of the regiment are to be disbanded on 1 August 2007, as part of the response to the IRA ending its armed campaign. The Army will end its support role to the police on the same day. Secretary of State Peter Hain also announced that troop levels in the province would fall from 10,500 to 5,000 in two years time.

In pictures: Celebrity revision tips
Model and actress Lily Cole plans to go to university this year. Here's what she says about revision "Basically I took ten minutes out to dance every few hours! Kept my spirits up!"
Rugby star Jonny Wilkinson says "I found making notes on the most salient points helped me to remember important facts".
I considered revision a great challenge on the basis that the correct preparation would reap the satisfaction of good results.
"My way of getting down to revision was to run off all my energy, have a good meal and then relax and focus for three or so hours before bed with files, books and the essential background music". Back

Isetholiad
Cynhelir isetholiad pan ddaw sedd yn wag yn y Cynulliad, yn Nhŷ'r Cyffredin neu yn Senedd Ewrop.Fe allai sedd ddod yn wag os yw AS, AC neu ASE yn ymddiswyddo neu yn marw. Yn ôl y gyfraith fe allai sedd hefyd ddod yn wag oherwydd methdaliad, salwch meddyliol neu os yw aelod yn cael ei ddyfarnu'n euog o drosedd difrifol.

The second Cummins
By Martin Gough
BBC Sport in St Lucia
Two months away from his 41st birthday, Anderson Cummins is one of just five players at this World Cup who took part in the 1992 tournament in Australia.
I'm 40 and if I try to pretend I'm 25 I'll fall flat
Canada's Anderson Cummins
The others - Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Sanath Jayasuriya - are all household names. So is Cummins - at least, he is in his own house.
Fifteen years ago he was part of the West Indies pace attack, coming in first change behind the great Curtly Ambrose.
So what are the differences between then and now.
"One of the things I realised pretty early is that I'm 40 and if I try to pretend I'm 25 I'll fall flat," he told BBC Sport.
"I bowl with the new ball but I do more with it than I used to, at a slower pace. The run-up is shorter. But it's all about what I can contribute to this team."
Having gained 63 one-day caps for the West Indies, at a strike rate better than the likes of Ambrose and Marshall, Cummins gave up international cricket in 1996 and moved to Canada.
There, he says, he "got married, settled, got a real job like normal people".
While working as an IT manager, he played league cricket for a couple of years but then took a break for six seasons.
His comeback was a stage-by-stage affair. His club asked him to come back and help some of the younger players, two of whom he believes have international futures.
When Andy Pick, who Cummins knew from his time in county cricket with Durham, took over as Canada's coach, he spoke to the veteran about coaching the fast bowlers.
Cummins had other ideas and in August, when he decided he was fit enough, he declared his intention to return to the international scene after a decade's break.
But emulating Kepler Wessels of Australia and South Africa in playing for two nations in a World Cup, played no part in his thinking.
"Those are nice little bits of icing on the cake but when I set my goal to get back here I wasn't looking at those things I was looking at being in good enough shape to contribute."
When Cummins last played against England, in 1994, the line-up included Mike Atherton, Graeme Hick and Matthew Maynard - the only remaining England squad member as he is now their assistant coach.
I had a bit of a shock when I saw Anderson Cummins out there - I played against him!
TV commentator Ian Botham
So far in his second coming, Cummins has done little to worry the world's best.
In eight matches against minor nations during the World Cricket League in Kenya he managed only five wickets at 48.60, with an economy rate of 6.39 per over.
He was the pick of a poor pace attack against Kenya, despite a spate of wides, finding just enough shape to have opener David Obuya caught behind for figures of 1-16 in his first six overs.
"In Kenya, in Mombasa, we played in 39-degree [Celsius] temperatures - really humid, really tough. Nairobi was at altitude, which was tough," he admitted.
"There was a lot of pain in Kenya but in the break before we came here it got easier.
"From game to game now I don't have niggles. I guess it's just about working and getting back into the routine."
Cummins refuses to wallow in the past but he finds a smile when he talks about his favourite wicket of 1992, even if the man in question had already scored a century.
Cummins fires one down during his former career for West Indies
"I had a really good World Cup. I was a bit disappointed we couldn't get over Australia," he said.
"David Boon was probably the best wicket I had. He was as tough as nails. I remember he got a blow from Ambrose. A lesser man would have come off but he got on with it."
"You try to take all the experience you have and use that going into the next one. But you have to understand that the next one can be totally different and be prepared for that."
Cummins insists his hunger for the game remains the same, saying: "You have to have the passion otherwise you wouldn't be here. It wouldn't make sense."
Defeat by Kenya means Canada face the unlikely task of beating both England and New Zealand to progress from the first round, and Cummins is realistic about the challenge.
"Andy Pick has been really good about defining our game - what we need to do. Forget who's at the other end, whether we bowl or bat," he said.
"We know we're rank underdogs. We've got to hope that the gods are in our favour, that we are at the top of our game."
