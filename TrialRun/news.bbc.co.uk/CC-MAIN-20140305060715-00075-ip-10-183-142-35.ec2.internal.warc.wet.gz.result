Timor registration 'goes well'
Registration centres opened in Liquica, scene of past violence
The first day of voter registration for a referendum on the future of East Timor has gone very well, despite an incident which prevented four polling centres from opening, according to a United Nations special envoy.
Jamsheed Marker told a closed-door briefing of the UN Security Council that Friday was an important milestone, diplomats said.
The envoy said that a total 195 out of 200 voter registration centres opened on Friday.
Four failed to open after anti-independence militia attacked a village 110km (70 miles) southwest of the main East Timor town of Dili on Thursday.
The fifth was inaccessible, Mr Marker said, without giving any details.
Violence
The run-up to the referendum has been marred by violence. A spokesman for the UN mission in East Timor, Unamet, David Wimhurst, said Thursday's attack was regrettable, given the assurances from the Indonesian authorities that the security situation was improving. Timorese opposing independence have demonstrated in JakartaHe said the villagers had driven away the attackers, killing one man and wounding another. Four of the villagers were wounded.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has told the Security Council that he will decide during the 20-day registration period whether the vote will go ahead as planned on 21 or 22 August. The vote will determine whether East Timor's population of 800,000 wants moves towards complete independence or autonomy within Indonesia. Indonesia invaded the territory in 1975 and annexed it a year later. Registration abroad
BBC Jakarta Correspondent Jonathan Head: "Everything hinges on a change in attitude by the Indonesian authorities"Voters must be 17 or over, and either born in East Timor or have a parent or spouse who was born there but they do not have to be currently living in the territory.
Registration stations opened on Friday in the Indonesian cities of Jakarta, Ujung Pandang, Surabaya, Denpasar and Yogyakarta, as well as in Australia, Mozambique, Macao, the United States, Switzerland and Portugal.
Unamet said it anticipated that one of its biggest problems will be registering an estimated 60,000 internally displaced people.
Talks between officials from Portugal, the territory's former colonial ruler, and Indonesia have been taking place in New York to map out future plans for East Timor.

Brown denies hospitals to close
Health bosses across London are planning a shake-up
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has denied the government plans the mass closure of district general hospitals.
He was challenged on plans for reform of the NHS in London put forward by new Health Minister Sir Ara Darzi, a practising surgeon.
Sir Ara Darzi proposes 150 new polyclinics - super GP surgeries - in the capital, alongside more specialist hospital units.
Critics believe this would put traditional hospitals under threat.
Although Sir Ara's report focuses solely on London, he has also been placed in charge of a fundamental review of the NHS across England.
This review of services by NHS London is a package of cash-led cuts to local services dressed up as a rational planning process
Geoff MartinHealth Emergency
Speaking at prime ministers questions, Mr Brown insisted there were no hospital closures planned and accused Conservative leader David Cameron of running a "scare campaign".
But Mr Cameron said Sir Ara was on record as saying the days of the district general hospital were over, and what was needed were fewer, more specialised units.
He said: "What can that mean if it does not mean cutbacks in departments, and closures within existing hospitals?"
Competition
Sir Ara was asked by NHS London, the body responsible for overseeing health trusts in the capital, to carry out a review on the future of healthcare in London.
It will act as a guide to London health chiefs who are planning a shake up in services as part of a wider reconfiguration of major hospitals across the country.
HAVE YOUR SAY
It all sounds marvellous but let's wait and see what happens when it is all put into practice Christine Cobbold, Rainham Send us your comments
London currently has 32 acute trusts - some operating hospitals from several sites - but Sir Ara has recommended complex and specialist care be carried out in fewer hospitals.
He said some of the hospitals left could pick up non-emergency operations and other non-urgent care.
However, these would also face competition from polyclinics under Sir Ara's plan.
The clinics would incorporate a GP service alongside diagnostic tests, social care, mental health services and some minor surgery.
They would be equipped with x-ray and ultrasound machines, allowing consultants to run services closer to patients' homes.
The review said that by 2017 a network of polyclinics throughout London could provide up to 50% of outpatient treatment currently carried out in hospitals.
He also said more care should be carried out at home, including rehabilitation and chemotherapy.
Wider ramifications
Sir Ara said the blueprint would provide better care as evidence suggests specialist centres for serious conditions - such as strokes - save more lives than traditional district general hospital models.
And he estimated it would save an estimated �1.5bn a year as it is cheaper to provide care out of hospitals.
But Geoff Martin, of the union-funded pressure group Health Emergency, said it would pave the way for the closure or downgrading of nine hospitals.
"This review of services by NHS London is a package of cash-led cuts to local services dressed up as a rational planning process."
Sir Ara Darzi believes people should get treatment locally
But doctors are also warning the review could have wider ramifications.
The national review Sir Ara has been recently asked to conduct was hailed as a "once in a generation" opportunity.
He has been given a wide-ranging remit, but some fear it could be used as a basis to justify cuts.
Jonathan Fielden, chairman of the British Medical Association's consultants committee, said: "It is pushing an old agenda, not a new one. Our concern is that this strips resources from hospitals and GP services.
"Clinicians have not been as involved as they should have been with this review and the concern [with the national review] is that that will continue.
"The last administration worked by having a pre-conceived plan and then having a consultation as a sop to the public.
"The fear is this could happen again. Changes to hospitals must involve clinicians and the public."
A Department of Health spokesman said: "It would be wrong to assume the solutions for London will be right for the rest of the country."

The essence of maleness
By BBC News Online's Helen Briggs
Scientists have deciphered the make-up of the Y chromosome, the bundle of DNA that defines the male.
We can start trying to figure out how the presence of these genes controls the development to become a male
Geneticist John McPherson
The genetic data will help researchers understand the causes of male infertility, as well as the evolution and function of the Y. It turns out that large chunks of the DNA sequence are multiple repeats of seemingly meaningless stretches of genetic code.
Buried within these regions are genes that are essential for male development, including the master switch that "makes" a baby boy.
The work was carried out as part of the international human genome sequencing effort, largely by US teams. Male 'catalogue'
John McPherson of the Genome Sequencing Centre, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri, US, said the genetic map of the Y would help researchers find clues to what makes a male.
The X (left) and Y chromosomes
"It gives us a complete catalogue of all the genes and we can start trying to figure out what the function is and how the presence of these genes controls the development to become a male," Dr McPherson told BBC News Online. "We're a long way off from understanding everything but we now have the catalogue that we can look at, and these are the triggers that trigger a whole series of events in development."
With about 60 million building blocks, the Y chromosome is the smallest of the 46 chromosomes in the human body. Window to the past
As well has helping researchers investigate the genetic basis of male infertility, the data on the Y will be useful in tracing the roots of male ancestry. The Y chromosome is passed, almost unchanged, from father to son, but tiny variations, known as polymorphisms, occur gradually over time. This gives geneticists a tool to look back in history and trace man's earliest paternal ancestors.
The Y chromosome sequence also throws light on an ancient biological battle of the sexes between the female, X, chromosome and the male, Y, chromosome.
Males have one X and one Y chromosome, whereas females have two Xs. Occasionally, genes on the Y chromosome are "overwritten" by similar genes on the X chromosome.
The tracts of repeated sequences on the Y chromosome may be necessary to ensure that essential genes are not lost in this battle with the X.

Hand signals to learning ability
Very right or left-handed pupils could be slower learners
Right or left-handed handedness could be linked to learning ability. Researchers at the University of Oxford are investigating how the extent to which children are right or left handed can be connected to their educational development.
The university's Department of Psychiatry and the Prince of Wales International Centre are following up earlier research which suggested that children who were excessively right or left handed were more likely to have learning difficulties.
In the initial research, children at the age of 11 were examined to find those unusually dependent on a single hand, a distinction which seemed to be linked to performing less well in numeracy and literacy.
Researchers want to explore genetic links between ability and 'handedness'This underperformance was also found to affect children who were ambidextrous.
This above-average right or left handedness would not necessarily be apparent to parents, but could be identified in tests.
The researchers now want to test a further 200 families to explore correlations between 'handedness' and ability and will consider how genetic factors might influence this.
"We think handedness is determined by a gene which may be found on one or both of the sex chromosomes," said Professor Tim Crow, director of the Prince of Wales International Centre, a research unit established in Oxford by the mental health charity, Sane. "We know that girls generally do better than boys at this age. If we can establish in this study that there is a link to their handedness, we will help demonstrate that these learning differences between boys and girls are something to do with this gene."
The new study will be funded by Sane and the Medical Research Council.
Anyone wanting to take part in the study should e-mail Judith Rue at the university's Department of Psychiatry on judith.rue@ox.ac.uk

Matthew Rhys on playing Dylan Thomas in the film The Edge of Love
As the red carpet is rolled out for the Welsh premiere of the new Dylan Thomas biopic, the assembly government has revealed it has a stake in the film.
The body will have its own windfall if The Edge of Love becomes a blockbuster, after investing �700,000 in the movie. The money came from its Wales Creative IP Fund, set up to help boost the Welsh media industry. The �8.5m film, which opens across the UK next week, stars Keira Knightley, Sienna Miller and Matthew Rhys. As a partner, along with the BBC, the assembly government can expect a slice of profits from ticket and DVD sales. Officials said the deal also ensured the production earned the economy of west Wales more than �1m when the film's stars spent three weeks last summer on location in New Quay, Ceredigion. The fund has invested �6m in 17 productions since May 2005, but this is the largest sum to date and "builds upon Wales' growing reputation for the creative industries," according to Economy Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones. He added: "We will continue to promote Wales as an ideal location to produce, develop and film world class productions." FILMS BACKED

The fund has also been used to support a forthcoming video game for the Microsoft Xbox 360 console. But all the attention will be on the red carpet on Friday as The Edge of Love has its first screening in Wales for a specially-invited audience at the Vue Cinema in Swansea. Welsh Hollywood-based actor Matthew Rhys, who plays the poet in the film, will be the top attraction. He stars alongside Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller, as the movie tells the story of Caitlin Thomas and Vera Killick, and their relationship with the poet. Rhys will also be officially launching an exhibition dedicated to The Edge of Love at the city's Dylan Thomas Centre, featuring costumes, storyboards, graphics and props from the film. Graham Thomas, Swansea council's cabinet member for culture, added: "We're delighted to be able to welcome Matthew Rhys to Swansea for the Welsh premiere of this much-anticipated movie about one of the city's most famous sons. "It's also terrific that people will be able to exclusively see memorabilia from a major movie right her on their own doorstep." The Edge of Love will have its UK-wide cinema release on 27 June.

British trio qualify for Olympics
Don won the world title in 2006
Alistair Brownlee, Tim Don and William Clarke all achieved the Olympic triathlon qualification criteria at the Madrid World Cup meeting in Spain.
Brownlee, the 2006 world junior champion, led the British trio home in third, with former senior world champion Don fourth and Clarke sixth.
Helen Tucker and Hollie Avil, the 2007 world junior champion, secured the criteria for the women's team.
Tucker was second and 18-year-old Avil fourth in the women's race in Madrid.
"I can't believe it. After my injuries I wasn't able to do much hard running but I felt awesome," said Tucker from Bridgend, who has battled injuries for the last two years.
"I"ve made the Olympic selection criteria so we'll wait to see when they announce the team but I fully expect to be on that pontoon in Beijing," said Avil.
The British team for the Olympics will be confirmed on 26 June.

Born: 25/12/82
Team: Sylhet
ODI debut: 4/8/02
Past World Cups: -
Right-arm fast-medium bowlerRight-handed batsman
Tapash has been blooded in the last six months as the selectors look to the future.The youngster is far from the finished product but has progressed in the international game in that period.The main strength of his bowling is his accuracy and his economy rate has come down as his experience has increased.In his first two outings he claimed the key Sri Lankan scalp of Sanath Jayasuriya and has since bagged Herschelle Gibbs and Wavell Hinds twice each.The first time he dismissed Gibbs came during his debut match in South Africa when he finished with three wickets.It was also the first time he had bowled out his full 10 overs and if he can get close to a similar return this time around he will be a happy man.
