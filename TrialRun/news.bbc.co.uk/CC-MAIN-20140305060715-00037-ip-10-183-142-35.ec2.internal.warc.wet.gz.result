China and UN visits intensify North Korea diplomacy
North Korea walked away from talks on its nuclear programme last year
North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has told China he is committed to ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons, Chinese state media has said.His comments came during a visit to the North by senior Beijing envoy Wang Jiarui and prior to the arrival of senior UN envoy, Lynn Pascoe. The diplomats are thought to be trying to restart multi-nation talks with the North on ending its nuclear programme. Pyongyang pulled out of talks after the UN condemned its testing of missiles. The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says Mr Kim's statement is broad aspiration, containing no details about how and when the transformation would occur. But coming amid the flurry of diplomatic activity, it has led to speculation that North Korea may be preparing to return to the talks, our correspondent adds. PromisesXinhua said Mr Kim had reiterated North Korea's "persistent stance to realise the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula" in the talks with Mr Wang, head of the Communist Party's international department. "The sincerity of relevant parties to resume the six-party talks is very important," Xinhua quoted Mr Kim as saying.
He said North Korea was willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China. Mr Wang delivered to Mr Kim a letter from Chinese President Hu Jintao, in which he said Beijing was ready to work with North Korea to maintain peace and stability on the peninsula and invited Mr Kim to visit China, Xinhua added. Mr Wang was accompanied back to Beijing by the North's nuclear envoy, Kim Kye-gwan, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. Citing unidentified diplomatic sources in Beijing, Yonhap said the North Korean envoy's trip was believed to be aimed at discussing the six-party talks. TreatyThe visit by Mr Pascoe, the top advisor to UN Secretary General Ban K-moon, marks the most senior UN trip to the North since 2004. He will urge North Korea to rejoin the nuclear talks and discuss the country's relationship with the world body, the Associated Press news agency quoted a UN official in New York as saying. Talks involving North Korea have a tortured history of stops and starts - formerly held under the six-party format which includes the two Koreas, the US, Russia, China and Japan. Last weekend, the North released an American missionary detained since Christmas for illegal entry, and on Monday officials from the two Koreas met in a North Korean border town to discuss restarting joint tourist trips suspended in 2008. North Korea has made clear it wants sanctions lifted and a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War before returning to the disarmament talks. Washington has responded that Pyongyang must come back to the talks first before any talk about political and economic concessions.

Italy split over hostages' views
By Irene Peroni
BBC News Online
After three weeks of complete silence followed by death claims on two separate Arabic web sites, few in Italy dared hope the two abducted aid workers would resurface from their captivity unharmed and smiling.
The aid workers have been accused of being "ungrateful"
But nobody had predicted that after all the candlelit vigils, silent marches and displays of national unity before their release, the women would stir up such a political storm right after their return home.
On their first day of freedom, instead of thanking Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi for securing their release Simona Pari and Simona Torretta urged the government to withdraw its troops from Iraq. There are reports that a $1m ransom was paid for their release, although the government has officially denied this.
From the very start, the former hostages said they wished to carry on their aid work in Baghdad and expressed gratitude to the Arab countries, Iraq's freedom fighters and the Muslim world for working towards their liberation.
You have to distinguish between terrorism and resistance
Simona Torretta
They said they once had a knife held to their throat, and had lived in constant fear of being killed "until the moment we stepped on the airplane".
But despite their ordeal, they insisted their perception of Iraq as an occupied country struggling for freedom remained unchanged.
"Guerrilla warfare is legitimate, but I am against the kidnapping of civilians," Simona Torretta, who speaks Arabic and was already based in Iraq before Saddam Hussain was ousted, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera.
"You have to distinguish between terrorism and resistance - I said it before and I repeat it today," she added.
Ms Torretta went on to describe Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi's administration as "a puppet government in the hands of the Americans".
'Fanaticism'
For more than 20 days, papers of all political colours portrayed the two volunteers as national examples of selflessness and compassion.
It is still unclear whether they were comfortable in captivity or were indeed happy to have been freed
Alessandro CeNorthern League MP
But after speaking their minds, the "daisies of peace", as they had been dubbed, became the object of fierce criticism by some politicians and part of the press.
They were described as cold, patronizing and "ungrateful" towards the government, and were rebuked for failing to mention the other victims of kidnapping.
The front page of the right-wing daily newspaper Libero carried the headline "The lies of the Simonas". Giuliano Ferrara, editor of daily Il Foglio and long-time ally of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, suggested the women should return the sum paid by the government for their release by collecting it from among Italy's "valiant pacifists".
The president of the north-eastern Veneto region, Giancarlo Galan, said he was "astonished and offended" by the "fanaticism" of the two.
Northern League MP Alessandro Ce meanwhile wondered how they were really feeling. "It is still unclear whether they were comfortable in captivity or were indeed happy to have been freed," he said.
Political truce over
There had been great anticipation among the general public in Italy to hear the two aid workers talk about their kidnapping.
The kaftans worn by the two women were a present from the abductors
Many were expecting tearful accounts of abuse, loneliness and anguish.
Others hoped there would be more transparency than after the release of three Italian contractors working for an American security company in Iraq in June this year.
Umberto Cupertino, Maurizio Agliana and Salvatore Stefio have never told their side of the story, which leaves several questions open as to what exactly they were doing in Iraq and the conditions and circumstances of their release.
Ms Pari and Ms Torretta eventually thanked the government and explained they were not aware of the beheadings of the two Americans and of British engineer Ken Bigley's plight until after their first statements.
But the much-praised collaboration between government and opposition to free the women is definitely over, and the country is once again split between those who support the Italian presence in Iraq and those who think it is time to bring the troops back home.

Jokers out for April Fool's Day
Practical jokers were in their element on Saturday as they played pranks on April Fool's Day!
Here at Newsround we reckon a few of you may have been tricked by our story of whales in a school swimming pool.
And Sportsround fans, did you actually believe that David Beckham could really secretly be Scottish!?
But after midday it's time to 'fess up to all your hoaxes. So here are some of the jokes people across the UK have been using to fool others with today:

Newsround wasn't the only website to have a laugh with its readers.
Top Harry Potter sites Leaky Cauldron and Mugglenet joined forces for one giant prank, pretending to merge the sites into one new one called The Leaky Mug.
Another website has been offering fake products such as the Desktop Tanning Centre, complete with "eyeball cover thingies" and a caffeine inhaler which promises "One puff and you'll have about two cups of coffee's worth of caffeine zooming through your blood stream." Click here for more on the Newsround website's April Fool
The Sun newspaper decided to play on Londoners who are still recovering from the shock of seeing a whale in the River Thames.
They mocked up a photo of a penguin by the side of the river to look as if had also veered off track and ended up in the water!!
The Mail also decided to give its readers a laugh by claiming that Prime Minister Tony Blair had replaced his door in Downing Street with a red one - because that's the colour of his Labour party!!
And in other newspaper hoaxes The Express was reporting on a road made of biscuits while The Times claimed Chip and Pin was to be replaced by a 'Chip and Sing' voice recognition system for cashcards.
