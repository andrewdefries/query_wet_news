Java tsunami death toll increases
Pangandaran residents are seeing the full extent of the damage
The death toll from a tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Java has risen to at least 339, health ministry officials say. Another 136 people are reported missing around Pangandaran, the worst-hit area.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.7 magnitude undersea earthquake that struck off Pangandaran on Monday afternoon, causing a 2m-high wave.
Indonesian troops have arrived to help with the search for the missing and assist the hundreds of injured.
At first light, rescuers were confronted with the sight of bodies in the branches of trees, and in the rubble of smashed hotels and houses.
Boats and cars were washed inshore by the water and the streets were littered with debris. I saw enormous waves engulf our beach and sweep away cars and boats

'We're living in caves'
Survivors spoke of a wall of water and a loud roar. "When the waves came, I heard people screaming and then I heard something like a plane about to crash nearby, and I just ran," Uli Sutarli, a plantation worker who was on Pangandaran beach, told Reuters news agency.
A Belgian tourist said he was in a beachside bar when the wave hit. "I saw this big cloud of dark sea water coming up to me," he said. Missing
In addition to the dead, about 450 people have been injured and around 52,700 people have been displaced, a spokesman for Indonesia's health ministry told the French news agency AFP.

Hospitals were said to be packed with the injured seeking treatment and people searching for their relatives. Body bags and other essential items have begun to arrive, and relief aid such as tents and food are being sent for the thousands of people who have fled their homes. The UN's World Food Programme said it was sending 15 metric tons of noodles and high-energy biscuits to the survivors. A number of foreign nationals were believed to be among the injured. Sweden's foreign ministry said two Swedish children from a family on holiday in the area were believed to be missing. Exact figures for the numbers of dead are contradictory, but Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the toll was expected to rise in coming days.
Warning
Rumours that another tsunami was about to hit had people fleeing their homes in the early hours of Tuesday.
JAVA TSUNAMI 17 JULY
0819GMT: 7.7 undersea earthquake triggers tsunami
0838GMT: International quake monitors send warnings, but no local alert systems in place
0915GMT: Waves around two metres high hit Java coast
But government officials and meteorologists say another tsunami is unlikely and have urged people not to panic.
After the earthquake, tsunami alerts were issued for parts of Indonesia and Australia by US and Japanese agencies. But there was no reported local warning of the disaster, despite efforts to establish an early warning system in the wake of the 2004 Asian tsunami. More than 130,000 people were killed in Indonesia in the December 2004 disaster.
The country sits on the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire", and experiences frequent earthquakes. On 27 May, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake hit near the city of Yogyakarta in Java, killing more than 5,800 people.

Business unites against tax plans
Alistair Darling has come under fire from big business
The UK's four leading business lobby groups have urged Chancellor Alistair Darling to put on hold controversial proposals to reform capital gains tax.
The groups, which include the CBI, have written a joint letter saying the plans will set back economic growth.
Different rates of relief for different kinds of investment will be replaced with a single 18% flat-rate tax, in a move outlined in the pre-Budget report.
Mr Darling says the measure will ensure private equity firms pay fairer taxes.
'Reverse gear'
But the CBI, Institute of Directors, British Chambers of Commerce and Federation of Small Businesses said they were "deeply concerned" about the proposals and were seeking a meeting with Mr Darling to put forward their case.
They said the proposals, which they described as being "a bolt out of the blue", would hurt small businesses and employee share-ownership schemes, as well as discouraging risk-taking by venture capital firms vital to economic growth.
"The impact of the decision will be felt throughout the economy," their letter said.
"The net effect will be to set back the growth of the economy over coming years by discouraging longer-term investment and risk-taking.
"Combined with this week's decision on capital gains tax, our members feel the government's 10-year effort to create a pro-enterprise agenda has been put into reverse gear."

Rape: A crime against humanity
Dragoljub Kunarac was sentenced to 28 years in prison
By diplomatic correspondent Barnaby Mason The verdict passed on three Bosnian Serbs accused of systematic sexual violence against Muslim women during the Bosnian war is the first conviction by an international court in Europe where rape was formally classified as a crime against humanity. Once it is established, the International Criminal Court will in principle be able to try rape as a crime against humanity anywhere in the world
Down the ages soldiers have raped women in the chaos of war, regarding them as a spoil of battle and usually going unpunished.
No rape charges were brought at the Nuremberg trials of prominent Nazis after the Second World War, and the Tokyo trials did not deal with the enslavement of Korean women forced to serve as prostitutes for Japanese soldiers. The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 does forbid the humiliating and degrading treatment of civilians in wartime.
'Crucial precedent'
It says women shall be protected against any attack on their honour - especially rape, enforced prostitution and indecent assault. No rape charges were brought at the Nuremberg trials of prominent Nazis
But until the war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was set up in 1993 there was no international means of bringing such cases to book. Human rights groups and women campaigners believe the case has set a crucial precedent in international law. For the thousands of other victims of rape on all sides in the Bosnian war who may never see personal justice done, it is nevertheless deeply symbolic. Months of evidence
The task of the prosecution was to demonstrate that the rapes in the town of Foca were carried out in a systematic and organised fashion.
The Tokyo trials did not deal with the enslavement of Korean women
The charge against the most senior of the accused said he knew or had reason to know that his subordinates sexually assaulted Muslim women. To establish the pattern of events, dozens of women gave evidence over many months that they had been the victims of repeated rapes, including gang rapes, some on so many occasions that they lost count.
Once it is established, the International Criminal Court will in principle be able to try rape as a crime against humanity anywhere in the world. The Court's statute agreed in the Rome treaty of 1998 covers various types of sexual violence, including forced pregnancy.

SpaceShipOne takes X-Prize spoils
Amir Ansari, whose family sponsored the challenge, looks on as the trophy is unveiled
The team behind SpaceShipOne has been handed the $10m cheque and trophy it won for claiming the Ansari X-Prize.
The spoils were accepted at a ceremony in St Louis, US, by the aviation pioneer Burt Rutan, whose company designed and built the rocket vehicle. SpaceShipOne broke through the Earth's atmosphere twice in five days to win the prize which was set up to galvanise the private spaceflight business. The UK businessman Sir Richard Branson expects to offer space rides in 2007. His Virgin company will use a development of the SpaceShipOne craft to carry five fare-paying passengers to more than 100km.
Sir Richard, who will call his spaceline Virgin Galactic, says 7,000 people have already shown interest in buying a ticket, which will cost about US$200,000 (more than �100,000).
An annual X-Prize Cup will now take place in New Mexico, where private groups will be invited to demonstrate their space technology. The X-Prize Foundation is also working with the World Technology Network to create a whole set of new awards. The so-called WTN X-Prizes will seek scientific or technological breakthroughs that tackle the most important challenges facing humans today.

Marines end valley mission
About 400 marines went into Ginger Valley
A Royal Marine operation to comb a mountain valley in Afghanistan to destroy remaining pockets of the al-Qaeda terrorist network has been completed.
More than 400 Royal Marines went into action alongside a small number of allied US and Afghan troops, after the US requested help.
At the close of the operation, a senior Royal Marine commander expressed his sympathies to Canada after
four of its soldiers were killed by US "friendly fire".
A US fighter plane in Afghanistan accidentally bombed a group of Canadian troops, killing four soldiers and injuring eight others during a routine training exercise near the southern city of Kandahar on Thursday. Royal Marine Brigadier Roger Lane, commander of 3 Commando Brigade, told Sky News that war was not without risk.
He said: "Although we may put in procedures and processes to prevent that, sometimes there may be a kink in that and an accident happens."
He spoke after UK troops returned to their base at Bagram after carrying out extensive operations.
They did not encounter any rebel fighters - supporting suspicions that many have fled across the nearby border to Pakistan.
The terrain is rough, and vast
But the troops did seize a "great deal" of papers, maps and radios, now being studied for intelligence information.
Operation Ptarmigan was tasked with destroying al-Qaeda bunkers and cave complexes in the mountains to the
south east of Gardez.
The area, known as Ginger Valley, was targeted by American troops in Operation Anaconda last month - an offensive in which the US said eight of its own and "hundreds" of the enemy were killed.
It is littered with landmines and the debris of war, including the wreckage of a downed American Chinook helicopter.

Brigadier Lane said this was a "real operation" aimed at destroying any residual al-Qaeda or Taleban forces and denying them future use of any facilities in the region.
The task force discovered a number of previously unknown cave complexes, one of which contained over 20,000 rounds of anti-aircraft artillery ammunition, which was destroyed.
At a press briefing Brigadier Lane said Operation Ptarmigan had achieved all of his initial operation deployment objectives.
"Royal Marines have been operating very effectively at altitudes of up to
11,000ft and in adverse weather conditions.
"This is a tribute to the effectiveness of their training and fitness regime
and also the efforts that have been made since arriving in theatre to get used to the local conditions."
Lieutenant Colonel Tim Chicken, who commands W and Z company's of 45 commando, said there were signs some rebel fighters had returned to the area since Anaconda.
He said: "Whilst we did not come across any Taleban or al-Qaeda there was evidence and indications that the facilities had been used."
Harsh conditions
"So, I would take it from that that the whole area remains one of some danger." However, at least one marine was disappointed he had not confronted the enemy so far.
"It would be a shame to come all this way and not have
any contact - all the lads have trained for it," said Andrew
Robertson, 24, from Glasgow.
BBC correspondent Jonathan Charles spent 24 hours in the combat zone with the troops, and described the harsh conditions the marines were dealing with.
He said: "It's very tough up there, no doubt about it. They're operating at 10,000ft above sea level which makes breathing very difficult."
He said the 63kg (138lb) flak jackets and packs the men were carrying posed another problem, as did the landmines, the rough terrain and freezing temperatures.
Meanwhile, more than 100 extra Royal Marines are due to arrive in Afghanistan.

Just 15 years after Rwanda's brutal genocide, the poor, landlocked country is hoping to reinvent itself as a high-tech innovator. As part of the Connected Africa season, the BBC's Adam Blenford travelled to Rwanda to find out how the country's government is taking the internet into rural areas - where even electricity is a luxury - and met hopeful students at a key science and technology college in the capital, Kigali.

USB drives 'could shake up chart'
The Fratellis join Keane in experimenting with the USB format
Music singles stored on USB flash drives could be set to shake up the pop charts, according to industry experts.
It comes as Scottish band The Fratellis release their new single and accompanying video on a flash drive, which fits into computers and laptops.
Chart rules have changed to make downloads eligible for the top 40 and it has now been suggested that flash drives should be included in the count.
Glasgow band The Fratellis were named Best Breakthrough Act at the Brits.
The USB drive was piloted last October with Keane single Nothing's In My Way, which sold out within a day.
About 7,000 Fratellis sticks will be made available at HMV stores. The store said there was a growing case for making the sticks chart eligible.
Lee Jenson, head of marketing at the Fratellis' record company, Island Records, said: "The success of the Keane single last year convinced us that music fans would welcome more audio releases on this format.
"If demand really does start to take off, it may well become viable to think about releasing selective albums on USB as well, especially if they were to become eligible for inclusion in the chart."
