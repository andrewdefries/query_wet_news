Sickness leave levels 'dropping'
Long-term illness accounted for 57% of public sector absence
Working days lost through sickness absence are at their lowest level in 20 years, a CBI report suggests.
The business leaders' group said the figure fell last year by four million days to 164 million days. But the CBI says too much absenteeism remains in many workplaces and that 13% of sick days are not genuine. The cost of lost days to the economy was �13bn.
TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said the report "smashes the myth" the UK is a "nation of shirkers".
"In fact the reverse is true and many people still struggle into work when they are far too ill to do so," he added.
The study shows that the Yorkshire and Humber region topped the regional league table for absenteeism, with 8.9 days lost per worker in 2005.
That was nearly twice the amount seen in Northern Ireland, with just 4.7 days lost per worker. 'More to be done'
The study, carried out with the assistance of insurance firm Axa, showed absentee levels were a third higher in the public sector than in private outfits.
Public sector staff took an average of 8.5 days a year off last year, down from 8.9 days in 2002.
Regional days lost per worker
Yorkshire/Humberside - 8.9
Wales - 8.4
Southern England - 7.7
East Midlands - 7.2
South West - 7.2
Scotland - 7.1
South East - 6.5
West Midlands - 6.4
Northern England - 6.2
North-west England - 6
Eastern England- 5.8
London - 5.1
Northern Ireland - 4.7 However those in the private sector only took an average of six days a year off in 2005, compared with 6.7 days in 2002.
If the public sector could reduce its absentee levels to that of the private sector then �1bn of taxpayers' money would be saved, the report claims.
Deputy Director General John Cridland said: "The huge cost of absence to the economy shows why so many chief executives declare that their people are their most important asset. "Hard work by companies to manage absence is clearly paying off, with overall absence coming down. But so much more can still be done."
He added: "Nobody wants staff to drag themselves into work when they are genuinely ill, but there is clearly concern that a culture of absenteeism still exists in some workplaces and this must change."
World Cup games
Employers said unauthorised absence include workers taking time off to extend holidays or have a long weekend.
Mr Cridland also said many firms were worried about staff staying away from work to watch England's World Cup football matches this summer.
However he said many employers have put arrangements in place to allow games to be watched in the workplace.
TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said: "Public sector workers have less short-term but more long-term absence rates than the private sector. "Public sector workers report long term sickness more for two reasons. First many companies don't allow long term sick leave - you get the sack. "Second some public sector workers are more likely to be attacked or suffer stress because of their jobs."
He said only "lazy employers" believe the solution to excess sick leave is to emphasise the stick. And he said as England's World Cup matches were evening kick-offs there were unlikely to be many "sickies" taken.
Manufacturing takes lead
Meanwhile a study by the Engineering Employers Federation has concluded that investing in occupational health helps cut absence rates. A survey of 600 firms found a "clear link" between addressing sickness absence and improving business performance. EEF Chief Medical Advisor Professor Sayeed Khan said: "Those companies who still put this issue in the `too difficult' tray would do well to sit up and take note of the very real benefits they would reap from tackling the problem."
The survey found manufacturing firms invested most in occupational health, with 65% of firms providing some form of service. This is more than double the national average estimated by the Health & Safety Executive (HSE) of 25-33%

Arthritis patients denied drugs
Rheumatoid arthritis can cause severe pain
Many patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis are being denied effective drugs, say campaigners.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) has said anti-TNFa drugs should be provided by the NHS across England and Wales.
But a study has found lack of funds in many NHS trusts is preventing many patients from benefiting from them.
It was commissioned by the British Society for Rheumatology and the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance.
Clearly patients are being let down if they are not being provided with these drugs
Jane Kennedy
Most people with rheumatoid arthritis respond to standard immunosuppressant drugs, but around 15% have symptoms so severe that these drugs are of little help.
It is these patients who have most to gain from being given access to anti-TNFa drugs.
Doctors estimate almost 1,700 rheumatoid arthritis patients who could benefit from the drugs are being denied treatment.
The results suggest little has changed since a similar survey was carried out in 2003.
Professor David Isenberg, BSR president, said the findings were "very disappointing".
He said: "It is immensely frustrating for doctors to have patients who clearly qualify for anti-TNFa intervention but are unable to get it.
"These drugs offer hope and relief to people who have severe rheumatoid arthritis, and are likely to be affected by high levels of pain and disability, making their day to day living very difficult."
Long wait
Di Vara works for the NHS in the Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt's constituency of Leicester West.
He was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis almost eight years ago, and has been told he should receive the treatment. But his consultant has told him that there is a three year waiting list in Leicestershire.
He said: "I love my job, and feel I still have a lot to give, but if I don't receive any therapy fairly soon I might have to pack my job up."
The survey of 148 rheumatology units across the UK found that 31% of doctors were unable to provide the treatment to all patients who qualified for it. More than 50% blamed a lack of funding.
Many doctors also said they were unable to provide the drugs to people with other arthritis-related conditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PSA).
Professor Isenberg said: "It is wrong that some people are being left with unnecessary pain and disability.
"The Department of Health should remind health trusts they need to take urgent and immediate action to ensure people get the treatment they are entitled to."
Neil Betteridge, of the charity Arthritis Care, said: "It is extremely worrying that thousands of people are being forced to live in severe pain as a direct result of being unable to access the treatment they so desperately need. "Our helplines team receives hundreds of calls every year from people desperate for information about how they can access anti-TNF treatment. Many feel they have been abandoned by the system."
Government action
A Department of Health spokeswoman said specialist teams based in every strategic health authority were being introduced to provide advice, care and treatment for people with chronic diseases like arthritis.
Two new classes of drugs had also been made available to NHS patients with arthritis following reviews by NICE.
Health minister Jane Kennedy said she believed NHS trusts had a statutory duty to provide the drugs for people who would potentially benefit, and lack of funding was not an acceptable excuse.
"Clearly patients are being let down if they are not being provided with these drugs."

Riders' protest delays Tour de France
Expelled team Festina still has its supporters
The Tour de France cycle race was delayed by more than an hour on Friday following a protest by the riders against the handling of the drugs scandal which continues to overshadow the event.
The French champion, Laurent Jalabert, said the participants were disgusted with the way they were being treated.
One team, Festina, has been suspended from the race after the discovery of performance-enhancing drugs in one of its cars.
Three Festina riders are still in police custody and being questioned.
French champion Laurent Jalabert, speaking on behalf of all the riders in the race, said: "We are revolted by what is happening.
"We are treated like cattle and in consequence today we will no longer ride."
Drugs scandal
Two weeks ago, 400 phials of performance-enhancing drugs were found in a Festina team - until recently classed as best cycling team in the world.

The phials contained a substance known as EPO, used to boost oxygen levels in the blood.
Last Friday race officials expelled the Festina team after director Bruno Roussel admitted to the programme of doping.
He and two other team officials are due to appear in court in Lille on Friday for a hearing aimed at determining their roles in the drugs scandal.
TVM assistant director Hendrik Redant: his team is also under investigation
Meanwhile in a separate case in the south-western town of Pamiers, three members of the Dutch TVM team are also still being questioned by police following the discovery of doping substances in a TVM car near Reims in March.
This is not the first time that riders on the most prestigious cycle race have gone on strike. In 1966 they staged a protest after doctors raided team hotels and asked for urine samples in the first dope test in the history of the race.

Concern at new 'legal high' drugs
By Gaetan Portal
BBC News
So-called "legal high" drugs are popular with clubbers
A new family of drugs offering users a "legal high" has been found by researchers in London.
They are based on cathinone, the active ingredient in the plant khat, commonly used as a stimulant in East Africa.
Although cathinone is a controlled substance, scientists say these new compounds have been deliberately modified to circumvent the law.
Expert John Ramsey told the BBC: "Presumably [users] think they're safe, and they're probably not."
The new breed of drugs are being sold for between �3 and �6 a pill. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Dance scene
Mr Ramsey is director of TIC TAC Communications based at St George's Hospital in south London.
He analyses the contents of legal high pills and other substances found in nightclub "drug amnesty" bins.
"The very latest ones we have seen are cathinones," he said. These individuals present with clinical features that are very similar to established recreational drugs such as ecstasy, amphetamine, cocaine and ketamine
Dr Paul Dargan Guy's and St Thomas' Poisons Unit "They are being sold as a safer alternative to ecstasy and I guess that there are a group of people who really want to engage with the dance scene and engage with their friends and don't want to break the law.
"Presumably they think they're safe, and they're probably not."
There is a booming market for "legal high" drugs in the UK. They are sold in so-called "head shops" that deal in drug paraphernalia, as well as at music festivals and over the internet.
It is not known how many of the pills are sold in the UK, but one recently disbanded website supplying them told drug researchers they were shipping more than 3,500 doses into the country every day.
Most legal high pills are based on a group of drugs called piperazines, of which BZP is the most common.
These will be designated as controlled substances in the UK early next year under a European directive, but there is evidence that those who market them are already trying to avoid the attention of the law. FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. More from Today programme
Pills analysed at the TIC TAC laboratory, which were purchased from a UK-based website, were marked "BZP and piperazine-free", but in fact when the contents were examined they were found to contain both substances.
And the latest discovery of cathinone-based pills suggests that manufacturers are aware of the coming changes to the law and are trying to find ways around it.
Seizures
Doctors at Guy's and St Thomas' Poisons Unit have seen the effects that legal highs can have on some users.
Dr Paul Dargan told the BBC: "These are individuals who present with clinical features that are very similar to established recreational drugs such as ecstasy, amphetamine, cocaine and ketamine."
Those clinical features can include rapid heart rate, raised blood pressure, high temperatures and seizures.
Ahead of the classification of BZP, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said it was pursuing 12 cases involving piperazine-based pills.

Daughters give Jane event boost
Jane Tomlinson with daughters Rebecca (right) and Suzanne (left,
Terminally-ill Jane Tomlinson said her family kept her going during her latest gruelling fundraising venture.
The 40-year-old raced with daughters Rebecca, 16, and Suzanne, 19, in the Salford Triathlon World Cup on Sunday.
She finished the "People's Race" in just over two hours despite severe illness restricting her training to only two weeks.
Mrs Tomlinson has raised �800,000 for charity so far and was racing to hit her �1m target by the end of the year.
She said: "It was really difficult but we kept each other going.
"It was fantastic to help each other around as it was really hard and really cold.
"We have raised over �800,000 for charities so far and we hope by the end of the year to have reached �1 million."
Family event
The triathlon was Mrs Tomlinson's first high-profile fundraiser since completing her epic "From Rome to Home" bike ride.
Conditions throughout the event - which consisted of a 1500m swim, 40km bike ride and 10km run - were difficult, with continuous rain and a cold wind.
Mrs Tomlinson said: "I'm tired and very, very cold. It has been really hard conditions. But the support out there was terrific and we kept each other going.
"Myself and my daughters just wanted to have the day together as a family. It is taking part in things and enjoying them that is important.
"It's nice to raise the funds as well but today was about taking part with my family and enjoying it."
Her daughter Suzanne added: "It was great doing it together. Mum put a lot into
this and she's done really, really well."
More than 600 athletes took part in the People's Race, which preceded the Triathlon World Cup.

Call for flood 'czar' to speed defences
The floods devastated many homes and businesses
The government lacks a clear long-term approach to tackling floods like those which devastated thousands of homes across the UK last year, according to a report by MPs.
There are also calls for a senior minister to be appointed as flood 'czar' to deal with the issue and try to streamline the system for handling disasters.
People whose homes have been flooded repeatedly are right to be angry
Damian Green The report by the cross-party Commons Agriculture Committee criticises the government's response to last autumn's floods, and calls for more funding to be given to local authorities struggling to pay for the cost of defences.
It says councils have to meet huge extra costs in dealing with sudden disasters, but then have to wait a year for funds to come through.
The number of agencies involved in flood defence is also criticised, with their planning and funding described as "Byzantine in complexity".
Accountability
The MPs complain that there is an "awkward division of responsibilities" between the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, with no designated person ultimately responsible for flood and coastal defence.
They say: "The ongoing review of funding gives the government an opportunity to develop a clear, long term strategy and the means for ensuring its delivery."
The Environment Agency reported to the committee that nine local authorities were unwilling to carry out inspections in response to requests for analysis of flood defences under their responsibility.
Campaigners say funding has been slow to arrive
More than 110 others had responded that they were unable to do the job because of a current lack of resources, lack of expertise resulting from withdrawal of their agency agreement with the local water company, or a combination of the two
reasons.
The report concludes: "It is clear that accountability and leadership at local level is required and that either greater powers are required by the Environment Agency or stronger direction from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions."
It is the second time the committee has reported on flooding and it does show some improvement.
The committee welcomes the extra �51m government funding aimed at flood defences but says it will not be enough to clear the backlog of unbuilt schemes.
Flood scrap book
Ministers say the report is helpful but reject the claims that the government lacks a long-term strategy to protect against floods.
Agriculture minister Elliot Morley said he accepted there was a need to get flood defences in place.
But he said the government did not know whether the recent extremes of weather was a one in 100-year event, or whether they were a manifestation of long-term climatic change.
"We must prepare for that and assume that is the case because it is better to be safe than sorry," he said.
Conservative environment spokesman Damian Green accused ministers of dithering. "The government promised us
new planning guidance on flooding before Christmas, but they are still dithering
at the end of January.
"People whose homes have been flooded repeatedly are right to be angry at the
low priority this government has put on improving flood defences and planning
for the possibility of flooding."
The report was published after families affected by the floods in North Yorkshire last year made a journey to Downing Street.
They handed in a scrap book of their experiences to the Prime Minister, highlighting the fact that funding they had been promised for flood defences had been held up in the complex process.
They fear there will be more flooding before flood protection can be built.

Jean Loup Chrétien visted Mir in 1988 and 1995
This was the year when the USSR began to face the fact that it could not do everything it wanted in space. The first and last mission of the Soviet Buran space shuttle was was an unmanned flight in November this year. Buran had been in development since 1980 and had been designed to dock with Mir. However its high cost and severe technical problems meant that it would never venture into space again. Funding for the project was cut - although it wasn't officially cancelled until 1993.
The first astronaut who wasn�t either Russian or American to take a spacewalk was Frenchman Jean-Loup Chrétien who stayed aboard Mir for a month in December 1988. He arrived on board Soyuz TM-7, together with Russians Aleksandr Volkov and Sergei Krikalev. The three joined the crew of Titov Manarov and Valery Polyakov, who were already on Mir.

Belarus 1-3 England
By Phil McNulty
Rooney has brilliantly rediscovered his scoring touch for England
Wayne Rooney scored twice as England took a giant stride towards World Cup qualification by beating Belarus to make it maximum points from four games.
Steven Gerrard gave England the lead from 30 yards after 11 minutes, but Pavel Sitko headed a deserved leveller for Belarus before the break.
Rooney turned in a cross from Emile Heskey five minutes after the break.
And he lifted home a superb third from Gerrard's pass 16 minutes from time to give coach Fabio Capello another win.
606: DEBATE
Capello...you've gotta love him
Mississippiskyblue It gives England a perfect record of 12 points so far, with Capello's huge reputation bolstered further by two convincing away wins against dangerous opposition in Croatia and Belarus.
And for Gerrard, a spectacular strike will increase his fragile self-confidence in an England shirt and silence any lingering doubts about his worth at international level.
Rooney's double also demonstrated his growing maturity as he provided a deadly spearhead to the attack, ably assisted by the powerful Heskey, who was winning his 50th England cap.
The Manchester United striker has now scored five goals in England's last three qualifiers as he plays a leading role in the new Capello era.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Capello praises Rooney's versatility
Gerrard had pleaded with coach Capello to keep faith with him after a low-key display in the win against Kazakhstan - and he repaid his confidence with a stunning opener.
He picked up the ball from Rooney before placing a perfect slide-rule finish into the bottom corner beyond Belarus keeper Yury Zhevnov from fully 30 yards.
Instead of settling England, the goal was the signal for a period of Belarus dominance, with keeper David James having to save from Dmitry Molosh and Vitaly Kutuzov.
Heskey was working tirelessly up front to keep the Belarus defence occupied, and his fine cross set up Rooney for a far post header, but he could not find the target.
Belarus were in the ascendancy, however, and it was no surprise when they drew level after 28 minutes at the end of a glorious 23-pass move.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Igor Stasevich was the creator, popping up an inviting cross to the far post for Sitko to arrived unmarked and head beyond the exposed James.
England needed to apply more pressure to the gifted Belarus attacking players after the break, and Rooney almost provided the perfect start with a great run that was only marred by a tame finish.
He made no mistake as England regained the lead after 50 minutes, but credit must go to Heskey again with a powerful run and perfect cross for Rooney to slide home from close range.
As Belarus attempted to force their way back into contention, Capello made two changes to his attacking personnel, sending on Shaun Wright-Phillips for Theo Walcott and Peter Crouch for the excellent Heskey, who was struggling with an injury.
It did not stop Rooney taking the game by the scruff of the neck and he scored his second, and England's third, with a goal of the highest class 16 minutes from time.
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Gerrard slid a superb instant pass into his path, and Rooney dummied a defender before lifting a composed finish over Zhevnov.
The Liverpool captain should have added a fourth five minutes from time when he rounded Zhevnov, but carelessly shot again the outside of the post with the goal at his mercy.
It was not a costly miss as England entered new territory by winning their opening four World Cup qualifiers for the first time.
Belarus: Zhevnov, Verkhovtsov, Filipenko, Omelyanchuk, Molosh, Kulchy, Sitko, Putsilo (Rodionov 67), Stasevich (Viacheslav Hleb 90), Kutuzov (Strakhanovich 77), Bulyga. Subs Not Used: Veremko, Korytko, Pavlov, Sosnovskiy.
Booked: Putsilo.
Goals: Sitko 28.
England: James, Brown, Ferdinand, Upson, Bridge, Barry, Lampard, Gerrard, Walcott (Wright-Phillips 68), Rooney (Beckham 87), Heskey (Crouch 70). Subs Not Used: Carson, Johnson, Lescott, Defoe.
Goals: Gerrard 11, Rooney 50, 74.
Att: 32,000.
Ref: Terje Hauge (Norway).

Johnson to meet Australia coach
Johnson says he is still undecided over his future with Wales
Wales caretaker coach Scott Johnson says he expects to talk with Australia coach John Connolly this week.
Connolly, who is planning a flying visit to Britain, is understood to be targeting Johnson for a place in his coaching team with Bath's Mike Foley.
Johnson has been put in charge of Wales until the end of the Six Nations, and has refused to reveal his future plans.
"If 'Knuckles' (Connolly) is coming over, I'm sure he will pay me a visit," said Australian-born Johnson.
"I think it is a privilege that I've been put in charge here (Wales) for a little while. I love this country, I love this team and it has played a really important part of my life. "But this all goes deeper than rugby. Whether they put me in charge of Cambodia or they put me in charge of Wales, it wouldn't affect my decision. "This is not about Scott Johnson, this is about other people. I wish people would start believing me when I say that."
The "other people" are believed to be Johnson's two children, who he left behind in Australia after accepting a coaching position with the Welsh Rugby Union in February 2001.
WRU roadshow
Meanwhile, the WRU are set to hold a series of meetings to discuss the events which led to Mike Ruddock's resignation as Wales coach.
Chairman David Pickering and chief executive Steve Lewis will be in Ammanford on Wednesday night for the first of nine district sessions to address the Union's 245 member clubs.
"The aim of the roadshow is to provide an open, honest and frank explanation of the rationale behind recent decisions taken by executive staff in relation to Mike Ruddock and his position," said Lewis. "We will be presenting the same facts to the clubs as we have already presented to the WRU board of directors on two occasions."
