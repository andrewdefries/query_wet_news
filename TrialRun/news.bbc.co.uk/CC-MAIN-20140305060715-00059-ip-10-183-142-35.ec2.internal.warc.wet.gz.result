Bush 'would veto new Iraq bill'
Mr Bush has already vetoed one funding bill for Iraq
US President George W Bush would veto a second congressional bill on the war in Iraq that links funding to progress there, his spokesman has said.
The bill, currently being drafted by Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives, funds operations in Iraq until the end of July. But it would then give Congress the option of cutting off money if the security situation did not improve. Mr Bush has already vetoed a bill that linked funding to a troop withdrawal.
White House spokesman Tony Snow said that Mr Bush would veto the new bill in its current form. "There are restrictions on funding and there are also some of the spending items that were mentioned in the first veto message that are still in the bill," he said. Targets for progress
The bill would ring-fence around half of the money that Mr Bush has requested to fund the war in Iraq. Lawmakers would then vote in July on whether to release this money on the basis of a report from Mr Bush on progress towards political, economic and security targets. US Defence Secretary Robert Gates said that a funding cut in July would cripple the Pentagon. "We will have forward-spent so much money to keep the troops in the field by that time that the truth is... I would have to shut down significant elements of the Department of Defence in August and September because I wouldn't have the money to pay salaries," he said. The BBC's James Coomarasamy in Washington says that it is not just the White House that is opposed to this new two-step approach. Some key Senate Democrats, including the head of the Armed Services Committee, Carl Levin, have expressed their concern. Mr Levin said it was simply not practical to keep the US troops on such a short funding lease.
The bill could come to a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Thursday. E-mail this to a friend

Diana birthday letters for sale
The invitation to Prince Harry's birthday party
An invitation to Prince Harry's fourth birthday party is among correspondence from Diana, Princess of Wales, being sold at auction.
The pink Spot the Dog invitation card, signed "lots of love Harry", was sent to a woman Diana had met during a visit to a hospital.
It is among four letters and cards written to the woman, who has not been named by auctioneers, going on sale at Keys in Aylsham, Norfolk on Friday.
One of the letters from Diana begins "Dear Doreen".
The invitation
and Thank You card were originally sent to a woman who met the Princess when she
was a patient in a hospital
Auctioneer Andrew Bullock
The collection also includes a Thank You card sent after the party at Kensington Palace, London, on 15 September 1988.
"An invitation to a prince's birthday party is something which doesn't come
on the market very often," said auctioneer Andrew Bullock.
"I wouldn't imagine many would be in existence because I don't imagine many people would be invited.
Condolence message
"The collection is being sold by an autograph collector. "But the invitation and Thank You card were originally sent to a woman who met the Princess when she was a patient in a hospital."
Diana's distinctive handwriting
A letter written by the Queen Mother shortly after the death of her husband,
George VI, in 1952 is also up for sale.
That letter is expected to fetch about �1,000.
The letter was a reply to a message of condolence sent by BBC radio engineer
Robert Wood.
He had helped the King to overcome a stammer when broadcasting.

Study aims to ease MS pain
More than 3,000 NI people have MS
Multiple sclerosis sufferers plagued by back pain have been given fresh hope through new research.
Academics at the University of Ulster have embarked on a major study into
ways of helping people with MS relieve low back pain.
The clinical trial will involve 90 people across Northern Ireland. Andrea Lowe-Strong: Team leader
The �350,000 research has been part-funded by the MS Society through charity donations. Team leader Andrea Lowe-Strong said it was the first study of its kind in the UK.
The study explores how TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) may help alleviate low back pain.
It follows earlier pilot studies which showed positive results from the use of TENS devices.
"This is just one strand of our wide-ranging MS research programme - but a highly important one," said Dr Lowe-Strong.
These techniques may help improve the quality of their lives and provide them with alternatives to pharmacological methods
Andrea Lowe-StrongUniversity of Ulster
"No-one has looked at the potential of TENS devices for pain relief for
people with MS. The devices we use have been specially adapted for people
with MS, who may have reduced dexterity. "The TENS units are attached to
special lumbar support belts which makes them very easy to apply to the site
of pain.
"We're trying to find ways of enabling people with MS to have more control
over their lives - and control over pain is a vital part of that," said Dr Lowe-Strong. "These techniques may help improve the quality of their lives and provide them with alternatives to pharmacological methods." More than 3,000 people in Northern Ireland are diagnosed with MS.
The research team is interested to hear from anyone with MS who would like to be part of the project.

Investigation into human trafficking in Scotland
By Reevel Alderson
BBC Scotland's Home Affairs Correspondent
The inquiry will focus on women forced into the sex industry
An inquiry is to begin to discover how many victims of human trafficking there are in Scotland.The investigation, launched by the Equality and Human Rights Commission Scotland (EHRC) will be chaired by Baroness Helena Kennedy QC. It will look at the sex trade and also report on whether the Scottish government is meeting its international obligations to protect victims. But police have found hard facts about trafficking difficult to establish. The inquiry, which will report late next year, will take written and oral evidence from around Scotland in an attempt to identify the extent of human trafficking. It will particularly focus on women brought to Scotland to work in the sex industry. Baroness Kennedy said: "This inquiry is about making a reality of people's human rights and serving those whose rights have been violated.
There have been no convictions for trafficking offences in Scotland compared to more than 100 convictions in the rest of the UK
Morag AlexanderEHRC Scotland Commissioner
"We will consider whether recommendations on prevention, prohibition, prosecution and protection are necessary - and ensure human rights are at the centre of Scotland's anti-trafficking policy and practice. "It is impressive that Scotland is taking the lead on this issue by holding an inquiry." The commission said that although the problem was not unique to Scotland, co-operation between agencies and organisations working in the area made it easier to study. Morag Alexander, EHRC Scotland commissioner, said human trafficking was one of the most extreme abuses of human rights. "There is a suspicion that Scotland has a disproportionate share of the human trafficking trade, and some have expressed concern that there have been no convictions for trafficking offences in Scotland compared to more than 100 convictions in the rest of the UK," she said.
Baroness Helena Kennedy will be chairing the inquiry
"This inquiry will examine whether these concerns are well founded." But Graeme Pearson, former head of the Scottish Crime and Drugs Enforcement Agency (SCDEA), said that when police investigated anecdotal evidence of sex-trade trafficking, they found very few victims. "The evidence is very thin on the ground," he told BBC Scotland. "A lot of claims made by special interest groups and voluntary organisations is anecdotal, and when police drill down they find very little hard evidence." He said that even when there had been arrests, it was difficult to secure convictions in the courts, often because witnesses were reluctant to give evidence. Det Ch Supt Stephen Whitelock, a spokesman for the SCDEA, said there had been no successful prosecutions in Scotland partly because victims were so reticent about coming forward. "They will be fearful of reprisals from serious and organised crime, either on them or their families," he told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme. "That all makes for a very difficult scenario in terms with dealing with victims. "From a policing point of view, we have to engage with victims and victim support groups to understand their concerns." The inquiry will also consider whether trafficking for sexual exploitation is treated merely as an asylum and immigration matter or a human rights issue. Recent decisions in the European Court have made it clear governments must be proactive in dealing with human trafficking to ensure the protection of victims.

Wind-power plan for every UK home
Every home in Britain could be powered by wind farms within the next 12 years if government plans get the go ahead.
Officials have unveiled plans to build up to 7,000 wind turbines off the coast of the UK to boost wind-powered energy.
Some people say the turbines are ugly and they're worried they will threaten migrating birds and sealife.
The government says it will look at the impact on wildlife, but insists wind farms are necessary as they provide environmentally friendly energy.

Government ministers want 20% of Britain's energy to come from renewable energy sources by 2020, and say they see wind power as being a big part of making that happen.
It could mean there will be more than two wind turbines per mile of UK coastline in some areas.

Worcester 10-23 Auch
Worcester (3) 10Try: O'LearyCon: HayesPen: Hayes
Auch (20) 23Tries: Bastide, PatatCons: Dambielle (2)Pens: Dambielle (3)
Worcester's bid for European glory was dashed on Saturday when they were outplayed in the European Shield final by French side Auch. The English side's hopes were effectively dashed in the first half as they conceded converted tries to Gregory Patat and Raphael Bastide.
Their two tries and Jean-Baptiste Dambielle's kicking moved Auch 20-3 up at half-time at the Kassam Stadium.
Daren O'Leary got a try back for Worcester but it was not enough.
In his last game for the Warriors, he touched down in the 72nd minute after hooker Ben Daly sent him clear with the scoring pass.
Tommy Hayes added the conversion to his first-half penalty to ease the size of the defeat.
Worcester boss John Brain admitted the Shield was low on the club's list of priorities ahead of kick-off.
We lost the game because we didn't have a scrummage platform
Worcester director of rugby John Brain
As a result, a host of first-team players were rested, among them captain Pat Sanderson, and this was reflected in a wholly one-sided encounter.
And Brain confessed after the match that he was not upset about the defeat.
"We don't like to lose any match, so it's a shame we were beaten. But it's
not the end of the world," he said.
"Our only goal (this season) was to ensure we'd be playing top flight rugby next season and we'd already achieved that objective. "We lost the game because we didn't have a scrummage platform," he added.
"Our problems in the front row towards the end of the season have been well documented and Auch scored 13 points from scrums."
Auch: Dambielle, Kinane, Sarraute, N. Pagotto, Bastide, Lafforgue, Lacourt, Marty, Sentous, Decamps, Tapasu, Laffite, Saint Lary, Lebel, Patat.Replacements: Bortolucci, Menkarska, Hooper, Arif, Bortolasco, Salobert, Lagardere.
Worcester: O'Leary, Sampson, Trueman, Lombard, Hylton, Hayes, Powell, Windo, Daly, Sparks, Murphy,
Gillies, Vaili, Mason, MacLeod-Henderson.Replacements: Fortey, Hall, Stuart-Smith, Delport, Brown, Hinshelwood, Roke.
Referee: Carlo Demasco (Italy)
