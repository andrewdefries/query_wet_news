Libya seals peace deal for Chad
President Deby (left) attended the talks hosted by President Gaddafi
Four Chadian rebel groups have sealed a peace agreement with the government, three weeks after negotiating the preliminary deal.
Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi hosted the talks alongside the presidents of Chad and Sudan.
The insurgent groups have waged an on-off rebellion against Chadian President Idriss Deby for years.
The fighting was linked to the conflict plaguing the neighbouring Sudanese region of Darfur.
The UN says there are 240,000 refugees from Sudan's Darfur region in eastern Chad and 173,000 internally displaced people. 'Guaranteed'
Col Gaddafi was quoted by AP news agency as saying: "I hope this is the last stage in the peace process in Chad, and I guarantee all signatories will abide by the agreement."
The army has been battling various rebellions for years The deal was signed in the Libyan city of Sirte by the Movement for Resistance and Change, the National Accord of Chad and two factions of the Front for United Forces for Development and Democracy. Under the deal, the parties agreed to an immediate ceasefire, an amnesty for civil and military personnel and the release of all prisoners. The rebels were granted the right to form political parties and to join the military and security forces.
The accord comes weeks before the planned deployment in Chad's volatile east of a 4,000-strong European Union peacekeeping force.
The BBC's Stephanie Hancock in N'Djamena says the peacekeepers' mission is a daunting one.
Major General Pat Nash, the force's operational commander, says troops will be there to protect humanitarians and those displaced by fighting, not to get involved in internal politics.
"This is not a force that is coming in to subjugate anybody. This is a force that is coming in to be a deterrent essentially. We will not become involved in the internal affairs of either country. That is not my mandate," he told the BBC.
Our correspondent says there have been concerns about the force's very strict mandate.
But General Nash stood firm on the issue.
"My situation is primarily to deal with refugees and internal displaced people. I am not going into a preventive situation.
"I would only be in a reactive situation where people were being attacked," he said.
Chad has been plagued by civil wars and invasions since independence from France in 1960.

US 'may delay vote if attacked'
Security is a major issue in the upcoming US elections
The Bush administration is reported to be investigating the possibility of postponing the presidential election in the event of a terror attack. US counter-terrorism officials are examining what steps would be needed to permit a delay, Newsweek reports.
Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge last week warned al-Qaeda was planning to attack the US to disrupt the poll but conceded he had no precise information.
A senior Democrat in Congress has said talk of postponement is "excessive". Doomsday scenarios
In its latest edition, Newsweek reports that Mr Ridge has asked the Justice Department to examine what legal steps would be needed to permit the postponement of the 2 November election.
This follows a letter from the chairman of the new Election Assistance Commission, DeForest Soaries, who urged Mr Ridge to seek emergency legislation from Congress that would allow his agency to reschedule the vote in the event of an attack.
If they do this, boy, my God, they're extremely desperate
Ciro RodriguezDemocrat Congressman
Mr Soaries noted that while New York's board of elections suspended primary elections on 11 September 2001, "the federal government has no agency that has the statutory authority to cancel and reschedule a federal election." Homeland Security Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse told Newsweek, "We are reviewing the issue to determine what steps need to be taken to secure the election."
Republican Representative Christopher Cox, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN that it was prudent to prepare for a postponement.
"These are doomsday scenarios. We don't have any intelligence to suggest that it is going to happen, but we're preparing for all of these contingencies now." Old information
But Jane Harman, the senior Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said proposing a postponement would be "excessive based on what we know". She also criticised Mr Ridge's suggestion that al-Qaeda was planning to disrupt the election, saying the warning was based on old information.
The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says the Democrats' unspoken fear is that the White House will play on the nerves of Americans as the election nears, hoping to gain support from a nation fearful of any change in course.
It is a difficult strategy for the Democrats to counter. If they appeared complacent and terrorists did strike, they would be politically destroyed, he says.
No US presidential election has ever been postponed.
Abraham Lincoln was urged by some aides to suspend the election of 1864 - during the US Civil War - but despite the expectation that he would lose, he refused.
"The election is a necessity," Lincoln said. "We cannot have a free government without elections; and if the rebellion could force us to forgo, or postpone, a national election, it might fairly claim to have already conquered us."

EU leaders seek broad bank reform
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Gordon Brown on Europe's 'common action' over the crisis
European leaders are calling for major reform of the global banking system, as they meet to discuss an EU rescue plan.
UK PM Gordon Brown said the IMF should be "rebuilt" to help regulate the world's financial systems.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel backed French calls for better international supervision of the financial system.
Meanwhile, eight east and central EU members issued a statement saying targets on climate change, the original focus of the summit, should be eased.
We need a supervisory body at a European level
Ferenc Gyurcsany, Hungarian PM
Euroblog: Climate rowNations challenge EU climate planQ&A: EU green energy
Poland threatened to use its veto on some parts of the legislation package unless its coal-based economy was shielded from the impact.
France, which currently holds the EU presidency, is keen to push through the legislation by the end of this year.
Earlier, the European Commission's President, Jose Manuel Barroso, had urged leaders not to forget climate change.
"Climate change does not disappear because of the financial crisis," he said. "Tackling climate change is central to Europe's future prosperity."
Early warning system
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday ahead of the meeting, Mr Brown made an impassioned plea for a global summit to reform the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to help regulate the world's financial systems.
He also called for the creation of an early warning system for the international economy and for more cross-border supervision of multinational financial companies.
"We need to deal with the crises as they arise in a better, more coordinated way," Mr Brown said.
"The IMF has got to be rebuilt as 'fit for purpose' for the modern world."
Mrs Merkel said a G8 summit should be held with the participation of emerging countries.
Earlier this week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for joint EU-US action, and said he would go to Washington with Mr Barroso to persuade President George W Bush and his successor to come on board.
Regulatory rethink?
At Wednesday's EU summit, the 27-member bloc is expected to rally behind plans agreed on Sunday by officials from the 15-nation eurozone.

It will discuss lifting the guarantee on bank deposits to 100,000 euros ($136,760; �77,760) within a year.
The proposal is one of several due to be tabled at the summit, and follows a commitment last week to raise the guarantee level to 50,000 euros.
But the cost of the latest proposal is likely to concern smaller EU countries.
Ferenc Gyurcsany - the prime minister of Hungary, one of the worst affected EU countries - called for more Europe-wide support for individual nations.
"The current approach is to let the nation state apply its own instruments, but we urge more common actions," he said. "We need a supervisory body at a European level".
EU Internal Markets and Services Commissioner Charlie McCreevy said increasing the minimum protection by next year would "strengthen Europeans' confidence in the safety of their deposits".
Also on the packed agenda for the two-day talks:
Leaders are expected to sign an immigration pact, committing their countries to common principles for handling immigrants
A decision to revive the failed Lisbon treaty, meant to give the EU more stable institutions in difficult times, is expected to be put on the back-burner until December
Talks on a new EU-Russia partnership treaty have been postponed, amid continuing concern about Russia's military presence in Georgia. There are divisions in the EU about when to resume them
Markets across Europe rallied after eurozone governments last Sunday pledged around $3 trillion (�1.7 trillion) to restore confidence in the banking system.
But on Wednesday recession fears sent both US and European share prices plummeting.
Asian and European stock markets also lost ground following two days of dramatic rises, and a report suggested Germany, the EU's biggest economy, was on the verge of recession.

Wolves' cult heroes
This vote is now closed.
Steve Bull has been voted Wolverhampton Wanderers' all-time cult hero by the club's fans.
Bull won with 79% of the vote, ahead of fellow Wolves legends Derek Dougan and Dave Wagstaff.
STEVE BULL: 79%
Pound for pound the greatest player to play for Wolverhampton Wanderers at a cost of just �65,000. The striker who netted 306 times to shatter the club's scoring record total, once with a seasonal tally of 52 goals. Also represented England as a player in the old division 3. He is the definitive cult hero of Wolverhampton and the hero of three generations of fans spanning 1986 to 2001. Craig Beale.
He helped to cheer up a whole city during the late 80s and early 90s. Wolverhampton's coat of arms states 'Out of Darkness cometh light' and he alone helped lift the darkness at that time and made everybody associated with Wolverhampton Wanderers smile again. It is such a pity that he was not on the pitch when we made it to the 'promised land' but every Wolves fan at Cardiff had a smile on their face and thought of 'Bully' when that final whistle went at 4.45pm on May 26th 2003. Steve Adams.
I absolutely have to put him in. He makes me smile out of pride - for his loyalty to the club, his speed (when young), his 50+ goals in two seasons (many so fast that I missed them through blinking at the wrong moment), plus also his poor control, his aggression and passion. I remember the Newcastle game on Boxing Day one year. Several plane loads of fans went up to the game, Bully scored four goals. Also, off the pitch no-one could understand him. I remember him fumbling through an episode of Question of Sport. I remember when he scored against Scotland. I was a student and being ripped apart for supporting a lowly team such as Wolverhampton, and when he came on the pitch I stood up and proclaimed that Bully would score, to much laughter. They soon shut up.Dave Bailey
Scored vast amounts of goals for the club and the player who I started to watch Wolves as a child just to see. He stopped my flirtations with Liverpool as a kid and made me become a proper football team supporter, rather than a potential armchair fan who simply supports the best team of the moment. (sorry Man U fans!) Paul Ashwin
Because he showed pride and devotion to Wolves at a level that Henri Camera wouldn't be able to understand. When he got the ball people would already be celebrating a goal before he'd even shot. A true Black Country local hero. Eddie Brown
Purely because he was my childhood hero, whom I was lucky enough to meet on one occasion. He was/is the most prolific goalscorer the club has ever seen and also, if I'm right - correct me if I'm wrong - the only Wolves player ever to score against Scotland (one for Mr. Hansen there). An absolutely electric player, he was definitely one to 'pull one out of the hat' and never failed to single-handedly raise a crowd to their feet in a desolate, dark, damp, December stadium thereafter. Paul DR Stimson
Bully had the fans on the edge of their seats with his sheer strength and ability to find the back of the net. He is still a folk hero amongst all Wolves fans and the fact one of the stands has his name speaks volumes. His loyalty to Wolves is renowned and a rarity in footballers these days. I remember seeing him play for England at Wembley and I was amazed how many Wolves fans turned up to see him play. How I wish Wolves could find another Steve Bull! Mike Buckmaster To vote for Steve Bull text BULL to 81111.
DEREK DOUGAN: 11%
The Doug was actually the reason at the age of about 6 that I started supporting Wolves. Having supported QPR for whatever reason, I decided to change when they got relegated and having no geographical alliance I picked the team that Derek Dougan played for. As with all good strikers they need a partner and his understanding with John Richards proved very fruitful. I certainly don't blame Dougan for the club's problems when he was Chief Executive, though in a lot of peoples' eyes it obviously tarnished an otherwise great career with Wolves. Roy Foster.
The Doog, big character off and on the pitch. Good goalscorer too. Warren Roberts.
Great player with a terrific sense of humour. I remember him waiting for a corner to be taken at QPR when being marked by Terry Mancini. He kissed Terry on his bald head and even Terry laughed. Michael Peppiatt
He loved and was loved by the Molineux North Bank. I vividly remember his entry onto the pitch at Molineux sporting a 'skinhead' hairstyle the roar that greeted this was unbelievable. Robert White.
Hard hitting centre forward always played with a smile on his face, and not a bad goalscorer to boot, perfect partner to John Richards. Paul Beeston
The Doog was a top entertainer, loved by all the fans...what more can you say?
Smashing guy...good in the air...and a damned excellent centre forward. Ernest, Malta.
The Doog....elegant and intelligent. David Hales.
Flamboyant Irishman, played to the crowd and the crowd responded. Scored typical debut goal at Molineux, a cheeky back-flick and volley. Went on to score a hat-trick. Idolised in his time playing for Wolves. David Walters.
Popular on TV during the 1970 world cup and is even forgiven for his involvement with the Bhatti Brothers. Paul Haynes
One of the scruffiest looking Wolves players of all time, but what a talent.
Helped make John Richards, a good player, look even better with the tireless work up front. A form John never really found after Derek retired. Barry Steadmans
The Doug saved Wolves. OK the brothers almost killed off one of our greatest clubs but he still meant well. Darren Barnes
To vote for Derek Dougan text DOUGAN to 81111.
DAVE WAGSTAFF: 10%
Left wing wizard who should have won more caps, he could put the ball on a sixpence and also had a great shot that got him some spectacular goals - the Doog once said that it was down to Waggy for his and John Richards' success in front of goal. John Davies
I remember as a kid standing in the enclosure at Wolves, Dave scored a goal from the halfway line. He skimmed and turned a number of players (as he always did) before seeing the goalkeeper off his line, hitting the ball, which carried like a cross and then dipped over the goalkeeper into the net. Who were Wolves playing? I cannot remember, but I've never forgotten that shot or Dave's skill of beating opponents on the wing. Mark L
Waggy joined Wolves on Boxing Day 1964 (my birthday). He was a tormentor of full backs and his cross-field wing-to-wing passing was wonderful to behold. I don't think he ever tucked his shirt in to his shorts. He was another player never given the international recognition he deserved. Robert White
A brilliant left winger in the days of Ramsey's wingless system. The best left footed player I have seen.David Crowe
He could turn on a sixpence! His hairstyle made him unique....quite a good player.Ernest, Malta
Mesmeric left-winger - and a character !!! Chris Crump

France 10-34 Argentina
By Rob Hodgetts
Aramburu scored Argentina's third try at the Parc des Princes France (3) 10 Try: Poitrenaud Pens: ElissaldeCons: Beauxis
Argentina (17) 34Tries: F Contepomi (2), Hasan, Aramburu, CorletoCons: F Contepomi (3)
Pens: F Contepomi Argentina powered to a convincing victory over France to claim third place in the Rugby World Cup on Friday.
The Pumas, the revelation of the tournament, ran in five tries to snuff out French hopes of revenge for their opening-match defeat last month.
Argentina scored through Felipe Contepomi and Omar Hasan in a fractious first half for 17-3 at the break.
Further scores from Federico Aramburu, Ignacio Corleto and Contepomi heaped further embarrassment on France.
Full-back Clement Poitrenaud scored a late consolation for Bernard Laporte's side but Argentina made it six wins out of seven against the French following their 17-12 victory in the pool stages.
"If we'd scored earlier we could have done things differently. But hats off to Argentina, they've had a superb World Cup," said France manager Jo Maso.
The third-place play-off is often dubbed "the match that no-one wants" but both sides came out brimming with passion.
Argentina and France contested a fiery, passionate encounter
France were bright and vibrant and willing to play far more rugby than the territory-dominated kick-fests of their last two matches.
Les Bleus, with nine changes from the semi-final against England, enjoyed several promising early attacks before centre David Marty touched down, only to be called back after Aurelien Rougerie's quick line-out was deemed illegal.
Argentina, who had made five changes from their defeat by South Africa, were intent on spoiling France's farewell party and took on the hosts, toe-to-toe at times, as sporadic fighting marked the first quarter.
Jean-Baptiste Elissalde and Felipe Contepomi traded kicks before the fired-up French crossed again, though this time flanker Yannick Nyanga was called back for a forward pass.
But Argentina turned up the gas on an already heated encounter when they demonstrated the effectiveness of their free-flowing rugby with two tries in four minutes.
Felipe Contepomi sliced over first after good timing down the Pumas backs, before Hasan burrowed over following a piece of good fortune when the ball bounced back off the posts from Juan Martin Hernandez's drop-goal attempt.
Contepomi's conversion made it 17-3 to Argentina and the Pumas did well to resist a heavy late barrage at their line.
France went close to narrowing the gap but Yannick Nyanga dropped the ball diving for the line.

What an absolute belter, my match of the tournament so far
Wallaceno7
But both sides went in with 14 men after France skipper Raphael Ibanez and Argentine lock Rimas Alvarez were sin-binned in a bad-tempered end to the half.
Ten minutes after the break, France found themselves further behind when Corleto broke the line and linked with Manuel Contepomi, who quickly fed the ball through the hands of Patricio Albacete, Hernandez and Alvarez before Aramburu scampered over in the right corner.
France glimpsed a moment of salvation when Argentine replacement Juan Manuel Leguizamon was sin-binned for a shoulder charge on French substitute Sebastien Chabal.
But all hope was extinguished when Horacio Agulla attacked from his own 22 and fed Corleto, who hared home from 60 yards out into the left corner.
France scored a consolation through Poitrenaud on 68 minutes and looked to be finishing strongly but Argentina refused to wilt and worked in Felipe Contepomi for a fifth try with four minutes left.
Argentina's second victory in five weeks over the Six Nations champions made their case even stronger for inclusion into one of the world's major rugby tournaments.

The server has two attempts to get the ball in. If the ball lands outside the service box or does not clear the net or the net post, it is known as a 'fault'.
If any part of the ball touches the line, the ball is in (as shown above).
After one fault the server may try again. If both tries result in faults, a 'double fault' is called and the opponent wins the point. With service speeds up to 220 km/hr, it can be difficult for line judges to tell whether a serve is in or out. That is why the electronic eye - often called Cyclops - has been introduced to championship tennis. The eye consists of a series of horizontal light beams 4cm above the court surface. The way the ball breaks the beam allows the electronics to determine exactly where the ball bounces. The rules of tennis still allow the chair umpire to overrule the result of an electronic eye, just as he or she can overrule a line judge.
