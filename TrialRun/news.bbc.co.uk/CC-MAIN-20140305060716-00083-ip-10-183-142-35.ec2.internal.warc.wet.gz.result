Sudan's Darfur threat condemned
African Union troops are overstretched in Darfur
UN Security Council members have branded "offensive" a letter sent by Sudan warning African and Arab nations not to send peacekeepers to Darfur.
The US called the emergency meeting of the council, saying the letter was "a direct challenge".
However, there is no agreement about how to react to Sudan's warning. Some members say it should be ignored.
UN chief Kofi Annan said Darfur, which has endured a three-year conflict, was "on the brink of catastrophe".
A 7,000-strong African Union (AU) force has failed to end the conflict - in which 200,000 people have died and two million people have fled their homes.
'Hostile act'
The president of the Security Council for October, Japanese Ambassador Kenzo Oshima, said some members felt "the language [in the letter] was inappropriate and offensive".
Mr Oshima said a resolution condemning the letter had been considered, but it was decided to concentrate on how to restore peace in the troubled region.

Enlarge Map Sudan's letter said that contributing to a proposed UN peacekeeping force would be seen as "a hostile act".
Sudan does not want the UN to take control of the peacekeeping force from the AU, saying that would be an attack on its sovereignty.
The council has approved plans to send a 20,000-strong force with a tough mandate but says it will only do so if Sudan agrees.
US envoy John Bolton said it demanded "a strong response".
Mr Bolton added that if Khartoum was allowed "to intimidate troop-contributing countries", this would mean the failure of UN plans to deploy a robust UN force in Darfur.
But Britain's ambassador to the UN, Emyr Jones Parry, said the letter was "unacceptable", but that it would be best to ignore it.
"In my view... the best thing one can do with it is to actually just quietly assume it hadn't been sent," he told the BBC.
The council said it was seeking "clarification" of the letter from Sudan's UN ambassador.
'Catastrophe'
Washington says Sudan's military is helping carry out a genocide against Darfur's black African residents.
But Sudan denies backing the Arab Janjaweed militias, accused of riding into villages on horses and camels, killing, raping and looting.
Instead of reconciliation and building of trust, we are witnessing intensified violence and deeper polarisation
Kofi AnnanUN Secretary General
The conflict began in early 2003, when two new rebel groups began attacking government targets in Darfur.
Sudan says the suffering in the region is being exaggerated for political reasons.
Delivering his report to the UN on Thursday, Mr Annan said humanitarian access to Darfur was at its lowest level since 2004.
He said a peace deal agreed in May had had little effect.
"Instead of reconciliation and building of trust, we are witnessing intensified violence and deeper polarisation. The region is again on the brink of a catastrophic situation," Mr Annan said.
Mr Jones Parry spelled out a four-point strategy to ease the suffering in Darfur:
Strengthening the AU force
Getting two Darfur rebel groups to sign the May peace deal
Persuading Sudan President Omar al-Bashir to agree to the UN force
Improving security for the displaced in camps in neighbouring Chad

Tougher US air screening for 'security-risk' countries
The new screening came into effect on Monday
The US has introduced tougher screening rules for passengers arriving by air from 14 nations which the authorities deem to be a security risk.Travellers from Nigeria, Pakistan, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Yemen and Cuba will be among those facing body pat-down searches and carry-on baggage checks. It follows an alleged attempt to blow up a plane on Christmas Day. US President Barack Obama has been under pressure to make visible security improvements. He promised to act quickly to fix flaws in the security system, in the wake of the alleged bomb plot. WHERE NEW MEASURES APPLY
Flights from Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria (countries classified by US as state sponsors of terror)
Also, flights from Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Yemen
Q&A: 'Jet bomber' case
Profile: Al-Qaeda in Yemen
Attack stokes Yemen terror fears
The new security directives came into effect on Monday. But the BBC's Jane O'Brien in Washington says it is unclear whether a pat-down could have found the device investigators say the alleged would-be bomber, 23-year-old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had in his underwear. The Transportation Security Administration said in a statement the new rules apply to travellers coming from or via countries on the US state department's sponsors of terrorism list - Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. Random checksThe other nations whose passengers face enhanced screening are Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Yemen. This is very dangerous - all of a sudden people are labelled as related to terrorism because of where they're from
Nawar ShoraAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee
As part of the new guidelines, passengers travelling from any other foreign country may also be checked at random. The main suspect in the alleged airliner plot is Nigerian, and Yemen-based militants have said they trained and equipped him. Hours after the measures were announced, there was an alert at Newark International Airport near New York City as a man entered a secure area without being screened. Terminal C was locked down and passengers were evacuated from the secure area, while some flights were grounded. The man was not found, but officials said every passenger was fully re-screened. Civil rights activists criticised the new measures. Nawar Shora, of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, told US media: "This is extreme and very dangerous. "All of a sudden people are labelled as related to terrorism just because of the nation they are from." Earlier, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown gave the go-ahead for full body scanners to be introduced at Britain's airports. Embassies shutThe machines are expected to be installed at London's Heathrow Airport and other hubs within weeks. YEMEN FACTS
Population: 23.6 million
Capital: Sanaa
Language: Arabic
Major religion: Islam
Oil exports: $1.5bn/24.5m barrels (Jan-Oct 2009)
Income per capita: US $950
Country profile: Yemen
Also on Sunday, both the US and Britain closed their embassies in Yemen, citing security threats. John Brennan, the US deputy national security adviser, said an al-Qaeda offshoot had "several hundred members" in Yemen. Last week, a Yemen-based group called al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula urged Muslims to help in "killing every crusader who works at their embassies or other places", as it claimed the alleged US plane bomb plot. The US mission in Sanaa was the target of an attack in September 2008 which was blamed on al-Qaeda and in which 19 people died, including a young American woman. On Saturday, Gen David Petraeus, head of US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, visited Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh to pledge US support for the fight against al-Qaeda. The visit came a day after the general announced that the US would more than double counter-terrorism aid to Yemen this year.

Potter movie joins world top five
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was directed by Mike Newell
The latest Harry Potter film has taken more than $600m (�343m) at the international box office, becoming the fifth biggest global movie of all time.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was based upon the fourth instalment of JK Rowling's series of fantasy novels.
The international chart - which ranks box office performance outside the US and Canada - was topped by Titanic, which took $1.2bn (�686m).
The first two Harry Potter films are also included in the top five.
The Goblet of Fire crossed the $600m mark this week, having been released internationally last November and December.
Its takings include �48m at the UK box office, where it was the most successful film of 2005.
INTERNATIONAL BOX OFFICE
1. Titanic ($1.2bn)
2. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King ($752m)
3. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone ($657m)
4. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets ($616m)
5. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ($600m)
Warner Bros Pictures International marketing head Sue Kroll told Screen International that she was "thrilled" with the movie's performance.
"(Director) Mike Newell captured the breadth and scope of this story, which allowed us to create a truly segmented marketing campaign that appealed to moviegoers of all ages and walks of life," she said.
The third Harry Potter movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban, is the only one outside the international top five, ranked ninth with takings of $545m (�312m).
When North American box office performance is also taken into account, The Goblet of Fire is ranked eighth on the worldwide chart.
Production has begun on the movie of the fifth instalment, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, due in cinemas next year.
It will be directed by David Yates, who made TV dramas The Young Visiters, Sex Traffic and The Girl in the Cafe.

The disappeared of Belarus
Zinaida Gonchar has not seen her politician husband since late 1999 but still believes that he is alive
By Tim Whewell
The last time Zinaida Gonchar saw her husband Viktor was on Thursday, September 16th, 1999. She got a message to say he was going to the steam baths with a friend, and would be back before midnight.
Listen to this programme in full
More than eighteen months later, she's still waiting. And the combined forces of the Belarussian state have apparently been unable to come up with a single piece of information to explain his disappearance.
In every country, people vanish without trace. But what makes Viktor Gonchar's case unusual is that he was one of Belarus' best known politicians - and the second rival of President Alexander Lukashenko to disappear in the space of a few months.
He was a punctilious, reliable man who was in the middle of preparing his strategy for a crucial upcoming session of parliament. Moreover, according to his wife, his every movement was being shadowed by agents of the very security forces who claim to have no idea what happened to him.
Svetlana Zavadskaya is the wife of TV cameraman Dmitry Zavadsky who has disappeared without trace
In almost any other country in Europe, the story would seem surreal. In Belarus, most ordinary people aren't very surprised. And despite
considerable pressure from the West to provide some kind of explanation, the government seems blandly unconcerned about the mystery.
"More than a year and a half has gone by and I've had absolutely no news about what happened," says Zinaida, a striking, elegantly-dressed blonde woman who describes her nightmare with remarkable composure.
"I have no new information about how the investigation's going. All I know is that my husband was abducted. And I don't doubt that it was an abduction organised by the secret police."
In Belarus - unlike Russia -- the secret police is still officially called the KGB. And that's only one of the ways in which this new nation of ten million people, squeezed between Poland and Russia, has clung tenaciously to its Soviet heritage.
Victory Square in Minsk
The clean, orderly streets of the capital, Minsk - relatively uncluttered by advertising - are a reminder of how other big Soviet cities used to look before the collapse of Communism.
Most of the country's economy remains state controlled - and private enterprises which sprang up in the early 1990s have in many cases been forced to close in the face of bureaucratic hostility.
But it's in its political system that Belarus harks back most obviously to the final phase of Soviet communism, before the advent of Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika. The country's president, Alexander Lukashenko, is not a dictator in the classic sense of the term. A former collective farm chairman, he was elected by a large majority in 1994 and may well win again in elections due to be held this autumn.
But since he first came to power, he's strengthened his position by means which the country's small opposition - and most Western leaders - regard as unacceptable.
In 1995 he pressurised the country's parliament into dissolving itself. Deputies who refused to give up their seats were dragged kicking and shouting from the chamber.
Later, Lukashenko won a referendum - regarded by independent observers as at least partly rigged -- to approve a new constitution. It extended his term of office and created a new parliament with much reduced powers. Opposition leader Vintsuk Vyachorka outside court just before he was jailed Today, Belarus still has an opposition which can operate openly. But Vintsuk Vyachorka, leader of the best-known independent party, the Belarussian Popular Front, says he feels in constant danger.
Last month he was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment for organising an unsanctioned street demonstration.
Other opposition leaders are now in exile in the neighbouring countries of Poland and Lithuania, or further afield. Some say they were warned that if they didn't leave they could face lengthy spells in jail - or worse. Ural Latipov, secretary of the state security council which oversees the work of the secret service and the police, denies western allegations about human rights abuses in the country. The elections planned for the autumn will be free and fair, he says.
But despite his powerful position he has been unable to gain any information on the whereabouts of Viktor Gonchar, he says, or of three other men whose disappearances may have a political motive - the businessman Anatoly Krasovsky, who vanished with Gonchar, the former Interior Minister Yury Zakharenko, and the TV cameraman Dmitry Zavadsky.
Human rights lawyer Oleg Volchek at the steam baths in Minsk where Gonchar disappeared
The trail appears to have gone cold. And human rights lawyer Oleg Volchek, who's attempted to organise an independent investigation into the four cases, has been unable to come up with new evidence either.
Remarkably, though, Viktor's wife Zinaida refuses to consider the possibility that her husband may be dead. And she's convinced that President Lukashenko will eventually have to account for an abduction that she believes is at least ultimately his responsibility.
"That's why I think Viktor must be alive," she says, "because I can't imagine that the President never thinks about the future, that he doesn't realise that however long he's president, there will still be the day after. And on that day, he'll have to answer those questions that I and the other families of the abducted are putting to him." WATCH/LISTEN

FBI accused of anti-Muslim bias
FBI denies accusations of anti-Muslim bias
Muslim leaders have accused the FBI of conducting an "anti-Muslim witch hunt" following a raid on the Texas offices of a Middle East internet service provider.
An 80-strong US terrorism task force searched the Texas offices of Infocom Corporation on Wednesday and Thursday.
The company is host to a number of Arabic websites, including that of the Arab world's leading independent television news channel.
"American Muslims view the action as just one of a long list of attempts by the pro-Israel lobby to intimidate and silence all those who wish to see Palestinian Muslims and Christians free themselves of a brutal apartheid-like occupation," said a statement by a coalition of Muslim groups.
The FBI has denied any anti-Arab bias, saying the raid was "one aspect of a two-year investigation that is ongoing".
Websites shut down Agents from the FBI and other federal agencies searched computer files at the company's headquarters, taking boxes out of the building.
We have deep concerns that this once again is an attempt to rush to judgment and to marginalise the American Muslim community
Mahdi Bray, Muslim Public Affairs Council Infocom said the raid resulted in a temporary shutdown of websites it hosted for about 500 customers, including that run by Al-Jazeera television and the newspaper Al-Sharq, both based in the Gulf state of Qatar.
A lawyer for Infocom said the company had no links to terrorist groups and was co-operating with the FBI. He said many of the sites were able to start up again on other servers, while the office remained sealed off by FBI agents.
"We have nothing to hide. We are co-operating 110 % with the FBI," said lawyer Mark Enoch.
'Pattern of bias'
Muslim leaders have rallied around Infocom. In a statement, several American Islamic groups condemned the search as "an anti-Muslim witch hunt promoted by the pro-Israel lobby in America". This is a criminal investigation, not a political investigation
Lori Bailey, FBI spokeswoman "We have deep concerns that this once again is an attempt to rush to judgement and to marginalise the American Muslim community," said Mahdi Bray, political adviser to the Muslim Public Affairs Council. "There is a pattern of bias that often permeates all of these types of investigations."
The FBI denied the raid politically motivated. A spokeswoman said the investigation was not aimed at Infocom's clients, but did not say why the company had been targeted.
"This is a criminal investigation, not a political investigation," said spokeswoman Lori Bailey. "We're hoping to find evidence of criminal activity.
"It had nothing to do with anti-Islamic or anti-Palestinian or anti-Middle East issues or anything like that," said special agent Bailey.

Analyst 'paid less than man she trained'
Ms Barton was a top-rated analyst in the City
A City of London analyst who was rated the best in her field was paid less than a man she hired and trained, a tribunal heard.
Louise Barton, 57, left fund managers Investec Henderson Crosthwaite after she discovered two men on her team were earning more than her six-figure salary, she claimed.
The media analyst, who worked in the City for 23 years, is claiming sex discrimination and unequal pay at an employment tribunal.
Australian-born Ms Barton, of Fulham, west London, claimed Mathew Horsman and Mike Savage earned bonuses up to three times the size of hers.
Having invested in Mathew...I expected to receive some compensation
Louise Barton This was despite the fact she was bringing in as much or more revenue for the firm, where she had worked for 11 years and she had head-hunted him in 1997.
In 2001 Ms Barton was ranked number one in her field in the Reuters smaller companies' survey, scoring a satisfaction rate of 74.6%, compared with 52.1% for Mr Savage and 47.3% for Mr Horsman.
Mr Horsman was taken on as a trainee investment analyst in July 1997 to relieve her workload.
Ms Barton said she agreed to share her bonus pool with him, although he "did not generate any significant revenue for almost three years".
�1m bonus
In June 2000, Mike Savage joined the team as a specialist salesman and, just before Christmas, he was appointed head of the media team, the position Ms Barton had been in, in an acting role.
"I was extremely shocked by this appointment. I was...more experienced and there had been no criticisms of my running of the team," she said.
She sent Mr Crosthwaite a formal letter of complaint in February 2001, claiming sex discrimination and had a meeting with him and Alan Tapnack, a director of the firm.
'More favourable'
Ms Barton said Mr Tapnack apologised to her and said the team would go back to being run jointly, and their salaries matched
"Having invested in Mathew in earlier years, I expected to receive some
compensation in later years when Mathew began to generate revenue," Ms Barton
said.
"It was evident in all categories of remuneration that my male colleagues
were treated more favourably."
The tribunal continues.

Key witness 'admitted lying for Archer'
Lord Archer: New claims over libel case
Fresh allegations that the disgraced Tory politician Lord Archer persuaded a friend to lie for him in court in order to win a libel trial have surfaced in the press. The Guardian claims the man who provided Lord Archer with his crucial alibi in his 1987 libel trial with the Daily Star was lying. The man in question, Terence Baker, is now dead, but Nick Elliott, a senior television executive, said that Mr Baker had told him that he had lied under oath when he said he was with Lord Archer on the night in 1986 when it was claimed he was with prostitute Monica Coghlan. Ms Coghlan has always stood by her claims over Lord Archer and has recently she said she wants to see the matter re-examined in court.
Mr Elliott says Mr Baker was lying when he told the court he was with Lord Archer at 12.30am to 1am, the precise time the Daily Star claimed the peer was having
sex with Ms Coghlan in a central London hotel room.
Ted Francis's original revelations led to Lord Archer's downfall
If the fresh evidence can be proved, it will strengthen the Star's campaign to claw back the money it paid Lord Archer after losing the trial.
The paper is now demanding the return of �3m from Lord Archer, which it says will cover the �500,000 it paid him in damages as well as costs and interest. The Guardian says a sworn statement from Mr Elliot has already been passed to the solicitors representing the Daily Star who are likely to pass it on to the police.
Despite posing for photographs Lord Archer has refused to speak to the media since the scandal first broke.
But his spokesman Stephan Shakespeare said the Tory peer denied the new allegations.
"These are more allegations from beyond the grave. It is getting more complicated than an Agatha Christie plot."
Mr Shakespeare added: "We have rules in this country that things people say in court count for a lot more than what they are reported to have said in private a long time ago and it is time for a bit of fairness."
The latest twist in the Archer saga follows his admission last month that he persuaded another friend, Ted Francis, to lie for him ahead of the 1987 trial.
Lord Archer was forced out of the race to become London's first mayor following the revelations and his future as a member of the Tory party is now in question. The Tories have sought to distance themselves from him, while the party's ethics and integrity committee continues to investigate the claims. Search BBC News Online

Travellers 'losing out' in schools
Non-literacy levels are high among travelling children
Only 21% of Scottish traveller children are receiving a regular secondary education, according to a leading charity. Save the Children says that traveller children are being driven out of education by bullying, abuse and discrimination. In a report called "Denied a Future", the charity says that failings in the Scottish education system are "leading to high levels of non-literacy" in travelling children. It has now called on the Scottish Executive to set out a clear national strategy rather than leaving policy decisions to individual councils.
After ending up in hospital I can't face any more and I've had to leave school even though that really upsets me
Girl traveller
Travelling people in Scotland are recognised as a distinct ethnic group by the commission for racial equality. But Save the Children says that there is a distinct lack of understanding of the traveller lifestyle in school policies, materials and teacher training. It says the system does not "value Gypsy / traveller culture and lacks the necessary flexibility to deal with the children's traditional lifestyle".
Save the Children says this is down to a "lack of cultural awareness running through school policies, materials and teacher training".
The charity's report details the experiences of one 16-year-old traveller girl called Jamie Lee who dropped out of school after being hospitalised by "horrifying physical abuse".
She is quoted as saying: "I really, really wanted to stay at school. I was absolutely positive and determined to get a good education despite all the problems.
The report says bullying is a problem
"But after ending up in hospital I can't face any more and I've had to leave school even though that really upsets me."
The report also details another case where a family had to conceal its identity so the child could get a stable education. It says that "radical action" is needed from the executive to combat the "discrimination and poor access to education" experienced by traveller children.
Save the Children wants ministers to formulate "a clear national strategy" to take the place of "piecemeal decisions by individual local authorities".
It has also called for a working party to be set up to develop an action plan in consultation with young Gypsies and travellers.
The charity says that in the long run a curriculum must be developed which is sensitive to the needs of travelling children.

Hogmanay celebrations go off with a bang
Fireworks lit up the Edinburgh sky as revellers enjoyed the Hogmanay festivities
Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations, which attracted 80,000 people, passed with only four arrests, police said.A total of 350 officers patrolled Princes Street and the surrounding area, where revellers from across the world attended the annual street party. Temperatures dropped to -6C and Madness and the Noisettes provided the music. In Glasgow, 10,000 revellers packed into the city's George Square and were entertained by Deacon Blue and a fireworks display. Heavy snow forced organisers to cancel the new year celebrations in Inverness. Chilly temperaturesMadness headlined the Concert in the Gardens in Edinburgh with lead singer Suggs appearing dressed in a spangly, checked suit to perform hits such as Baggy Trousers and One Step Beyond. Noisettes lead singer Shingai Shoniwa ignored the chilly temperatures, ditching her jacket to dance in a white corset and skirt to sing Don't Upset the Rhythm. Meanwhile crowds gathered at the esplanade of Stirling Castle saw in the new year with acts including Sandi Thom and the MacDonald Brothers. Three stages along Princes Street provided entertainment by bands including Indie rockers We Were Promised Jetpacks and rock band The Enemy.
Onlookers enjoyed a a laser and light display in Princes Street
Traditional Scottish music was also on offer at The Keilidh. Pete Irvine, creative director of Edinburgh's Hogmanay, described the atmosphere at the street party as "friendly and euphoric". He said: "It has been an extraordinary night in Edinburgh with brilliant music, a magical fireworks display against a full moon sky and the dramatic castle slopes dotted with snow, and a friendly and euphoric atmosphere that you won't find anywhere else in the world." Revellers heeded warnings to wrap up warm and many wore horned tartan helmets and furry Highland cow hats. The street party is the highlight of a five-day Hogmanay Festival in Edinburgh, featuring a torchlight procession and dance and music events, which ends on 2 January. Four people were arrested for breach of the peace and five people were treated in hospital for minor injuries.
I am delighted that the celebrations have gone well, and that most people have taken our advice by wrapping up warm, and drinking responsibly
Dr Charles SwainsonNHS Lothian
Medical Director, NHS Lothian, Dr Charles Swainson, said: "Thousands of people have braved the cold weather to join in the festivities and the Hogmanay street party is one of the highlights of the year. "I am delighted that the celebrations have gone well, and that most people have taken our advice by wrapping up warm, and drinking responsibly." The Scottish Ambulance Service said Hogmanay was once again its busiest night of the year. A spokesman said the service dealt with 2,247 calls to its 999 centres across Scotland between midnight and 0700 GMT on 1 January. That was an increase of 5% on last year's total of 2,141 calls. Arrangements were made for extra crews and control room staff to provide cover across the country and Edinburgh experienced the biggest increase with a 20% rise in call volumes. In Aberdeen a fireworks display was held over His Majesty's Theatre at midnight, while the streets of Stonehaven, in Aberdeenshire, were lit up by the 150-year-old fireball festival. Airport closureMeanwhile the event in Inverness was cancelled as the weather deteriorated, making travel routes treacherous. A large crowd had been expected in the city for the Red Hot Highland Fling - a free event with entertainment from cult bagpipe group The Red Hot Chilli Pipers and Celtic fusion band the Peatbog Fairies. Northern Constabulary said they had rescued motorists stranded on the A9 southbound and urged people not to make unnecessary journeys. Ch Insp Andrew MacLean, said: "The underfoot conditions in Inverness are extremely hazardous and the roads in the city and in the outlying areas are treacherous." Meanwhile the closure of Inverness airport meant dozens of passengers had to find overnight accommodation in the city. But 16 opted to stay in the terminal to bring in the new year with champagne and pizza.

First minister's questions
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The leader of the Liberal Democrats challenged the value of the government's Communities First programme during first minister's questions on 9 October 2012."Eleven years, £300 million to make the poorest communities better.... and by all independent analysis you have failed," said Kirsty Williams. She quoted statements from various agencies including the Rowntree Foundation - questioning the success of the scheme, saying the first minister had "not been able to offer any statistics" showing the scheme had been a success. Carwyn Jones AM disagreed with Ms Williams, saying that he had been to communities across Wales that had benefited from Communities First. As well as facing questions from opposition leaders, Mr Jones answered questions on free school meals, the economy and the availability of broadband in west Wales. The beginning of this video is unavailable due to a technical fault.

In pictures: Super-predatory owls and eagles hunt foxes
Super-predation, where a top predator preys on another predator, is widespread in Europe, a study finds. But it is hard to film in the wild. Here, researchers use a trained eagle owl and mounted tawny owl to illustrate the behaviour.
Eagle owls hunt foxes, for example. This dead fox was found in an wild eagle owl nest, and researchers allowed a trained owl to attack it to illustrate what happens naturally. The study, published in the journal Population Ecology, examined the feeding habits of four large raptors that occur in Europe: the goshawk, golden eagle, Bonelli's eagle and eagle owl (above). These birds (goshawk above) prey on other predators such as tawny owls, kestrels and foxes, analyses of their diets reveal. However, preying on another predator is risky, carrying a high risk of injury. It occurs when food such as rodents become scarce.
It also happens more often in places such as central Europe, where people have altered habitats, decreasing numbers of normal prey such as birds or small mammals, says researcher Rui Lourenco of the University of Evora, Portugal, who conducted the study.
Super-predation, such as this young eagle owl feeding on a little owl near a nest, may play a significant and under-appreciated role in the workings of some ecosystems, say the researchers.

Narcoviolencia se filtra en EE.UU.
Redacci�n BBC Mundo
Los plagios y toma de rehenes en hogares se han cuadruplicado en cinco a�os.
Las autoridades del estado sure�o de Estados Unidos Arizona sonaron las alarmas sobre la filtraci�n de actividades relacionadas con el narcotr�fico mexicano.
La polic�a local asegura que �ltimamente se ha registrado un notable incremento de secuestros, tiroteos e invasiones a hogares, t�cticas com�nmente usadas por carteles.
La ciudad de Phoenix, Arizona, se ha convertido en la capital del secuestro en EE.UU., y la polic�a est� vinculando estos actos criminales a los carteles de la droga mexicana y sus grupos asociados en suelo estadounidense.
Al parecer, los secuestros para pedir recompensa monetaria se est� convirtiendo en una actividad suplementaria rentable para las organizaciones criminales.
En los �ltimos 12 meses, la cadena de televisi�n estadounidense ABC, inform� que se registraron m�s de 370 raptos en Phoenix, lo que la coloca de segunda en la lista de secuestros en el mundo, superada s�lo por la Ciudad de M�xico.
Durante una reuni�n con pol�ticos de Arizona, fuerzas de la ley en el estado presentaron un reporte sobre amenazas impuestas por bandas que operan a los dos lados de la frontera.
Las cifras oficiales del condado de Maricopa, que rodea a Phoenix, muestra que los secuestros y toma de rehenes en hogares se han cuadruplicado en los �ltimos cinco a�os.
Equipo militar
Un oficial de la polic�a declar� que cada vez hay m�s denuncias por delincuentes armados con rifles de asalto y granadas usadas por el ej�rcito.
Tambi�n indic� que exist�an casos frecuentes de hombres armados entrando a propiedades que se hacen pasar por unidades de la polic�a.
Los carteles de la droga en M�xico llevan a�os de enfrentamientos, pero como las autoridades mexicanas est�n aumentando la presi�n y los esfuerzos para combatir al narcotr�fico, varios analistas en seguridad creen que el problema se est� exportando a EE.UU.
No obstante, la violencia en los estados norte�os de M�xico contin�a. El fin de semana, el jefe de la Polic�a de Ciudad Ju�rez renunci� a su cargo tras intimidaciones del crimen organizado.
La corresponsal de BBC Mundo en ese pa�s, Cecilia Barr�a, inform� que a Roberto Ordu�a lo hab�a amenazado de asesinar a un agente de la polic�a cada 48 horas si �ste no dejaba su cargo.
"Ordu�a inform� sobre la dimisi�n a su cargo horas despu�s de que un funcionario policial y el guardia de una prisi�n fueran asesinados", agreg� Barr�a.

1971: Six dead in Scottish mountain tragedy
Five teenagers and their female instructor have died in one of Scotland's worst mountaineering accidents.
Rescue teams found the bodies buried beneath snow on the 4,084 ft (1,245 m) high Cairngorm, which the party of eight had left to climb three days ago.
The teenagers were all from Ainslie Park School in Edinburgh and had been staying at the city's Lagganlia Outdoor Centre in Kincraig, Aviemore.
The two survivors - party leader Catherine Davidson, 21, and Raymond Leslie, 15 - are in an Inverness hospital recovering from severe exposure and frostbite.
The alarm was raised when the group failed to arrive at their intended destination on Saturday 19 November, but early rescue attempts were hampered by bad weather and were abandoned at dusk.
Police, troops and mountain rescue teams began a new search on Sunday, but that was also called off in the face of the worst blizzards in Scotland this winter.
'Condition improving'
A clearing in the weather on Monday allowed 50 people assisted by several helicopters to return to the mountain.
Miss Davidson was found alone on the eastern side of Cairngorm and directed her rescuers to the location of the rest of the party about half-a-mile (805 metres) away.
The two boys were alive, but one died shortly after the mountain rescue team arrived. All five girls and the assistant instructor, Sheila Sunderland, 19, were dead.
The 15-year-old survivor was airlifted to Raigmore Hospital after being picked up by a Navy helicopter from a small ledge, 3,000 ft up the mountain.
A spokesman for the hospital said his condition was improving.

In Context
The other members of the party who died were: Carol Bertram, Susan Byrne, Corraine Dick, William Kerr and Diane Dudgeon. They were all aged 14 or 15.
Soft snow had made their walk much harder going than expected and the group failed to reach the safety of a mountain hut at the end of the first day of their walk.
They dug a snow shelter but high winds blew most of it away and they had to bear the full brunt of the extreme blizzard conditions.
Although the members of the party were fairly well-equipped, their chances of survival after two nights out were very slim.

England handed Broad injury boost
Broad took 2-28 in four overs against Diamond Eagles
Scans on seamer Stuart Broad's right shoulder showed no serious damage but he will miss at least two of England's tour matches in South Africa.Broad, 23, sustained the injury while fielding in Friday's win against Diamond Eagles in Bloemfontein. He will miss Sunday's match against Warriors in Kimberley and the game against South Africa A on Tuesday. Meanwhile, pace bowler Graham Onions faces a fitness test on his lower back before Sunday's game. Broad will receive treatment in the hope of returning for the two Twenty20 internationals from 13 November. The Nottinghamshire star has been a key member of the England squad in all forms of the game over the past two years and helped them regain the Ashes with victory over Australia last summer.
606: DEBATE
Your thoughts on Stuart Broad's injury
His importance has been magnified by the retirement from Test cricket of all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, who is also ruled out of England's one-day and Twenty20 squads in South Africa through injury. England's tour consists of two Twenty20 internationals, five one-day internationals and four Test matches.

Schools Spotlight on Team St. Patrick's
Wilson Kipketa, three-time world 800m champion and graduate of St Patrick's
In the Spotlight this week is St Patrick's High School in Kenya, a school remarkable for producing long-distance running champions, and its UK partner school, Highcliffe School in Dorset. UPDATE FROM THE SCHOOLS
Phil Coughlan, Teacher, Highcliffe School, and Alex Oyuga, Teacher, St Patrick's
The enthusiasm generated during Olympic Dreams Live easily transferred to Highcliffe school with the visit of Mr Oyuga (Alex) and Moses. This tour was an opportunity to provide Alex and Moses with a relaxed day of sightseeing and souvenir hunting
Monday passed in a blur of meetings and tours, seeing the school at work and talking with as many staff and students as possible. There were discussions covering curricula, day-to-day school activities, lesson styles, and societal attitudes to education and aspirations of students - as well as the important issue of the passionate devotion of the Kenyan sporting public to the Premier League. In a particular highlight, Moses attended an after school International Dimension School Planning Group meeting and entranced the staff for an hour with his analysis of the similarities and differences between his schooling and that of his peers in the UK - outlining the good and bad aspects of life as a Kenyan teenager and some sophisticated geopolitical analysis. On the Tuesday we were lucky enough to be able to arrange a tour of the Olympic Sailing Centre in Weymouth for Alex, Moses and a group of our gifted and talented sports students. Highcliffe school visit the Olympic Sailing Centre in Weymouth with Alex and Moses
Obviously it is early days, but two main projects are being developed for a trial run in the summer term and full-scale implementation in 2012. Once our friends returned to Kenya, the hard work began to tackle the logistical problems involved in setting up mutually useful, curriculum based projects between the schools One project goes under the grand name of 'Mini-Olympics'. This will be a P.E. project with team competitions; each team drawn jointly from the two schools and events taking place in both schools. The scores will be combined to produce winning teams, with award ceremonies taking place in each school. The idea is to expand this next year to create opportunities for communication and planning between the students leading up to events. The second project is the entering of a team from Highcliffe (defending British honour) in the Iten Mathematics Competition which is organised by St Patrick's and is a big national competition in Kenya. We were also lucky that the link occurred at a time when St Patrick's was coming up to celebrations of its 50th anniversary. We were able to share a report of this event, attended by the Kenyan PM, with the local community here in Highcliffe via our school newsletter. As we plan the activities for the next academic year the sense of excitement builds for both the link and 2012 itself. Highcliffe Students are highly impressed with St Patrick's when they see video of it in assemblies. Barely a day passes now without a staff member or student reminding Phil that they need to be on the plane 'when we go to Kenya!'
