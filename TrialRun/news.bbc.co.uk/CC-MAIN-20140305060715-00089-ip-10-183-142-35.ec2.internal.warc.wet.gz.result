Profile: FBI chief Robert Mueller
Mr Mueller also worked for George Bush senior
President George Bush's decision to nominate Robert Mueller for director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation came as no surprise.
He had long been considered the most likely choice to replace Louis Freeh, who announced his retirement in May, well ahead of the end of his term in 2003. But Mr Mueller faces the task of rehabilitating the public image of a badly battered FBI.
Many questions about the efficiency of the security services have been raised in the wake of the devastating attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
When the hijacked planes were deliberately crashed into the buildings the agency was still reeling from the Robert Hanssen spy scandal and a last-minute revelation that it failed to turn over thousands of pages of documents to lawyers defending Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh.
Important backing
Mr Mueller gained the backing of Attorney-General John Ashcroft after serving as acting deputy attorney-general from January to May this year.
Mr Ashcroft's support was key because the Bush administration wants to bring the FBI under tighter control of the Justice Department. The FBI made a blunder in the McVeigh case
Mr Mueller, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, is known as a strong manager, a trait the administration saw as necessary in rehabilitating the FBI. He also is well respected in federal law enforcement circles, and he would bring a wide range of legal experience to the post.
Although a conservative Republican, he is known for his ability to win support from both parties. California Senator Barbara Boxer, a liberal Democrat, recommended him for his previoust post as the US Attorney for the Northern District of California.
He began his law career at a private law firm in San Francisco in 1973, and he took his first public post in 1976 when he became an assistant US attorney in San Francisco, where he served until 1982. He then moved to Boston where he held several positions in the US Attorney's office there, including criminal division chief and deputy United States attorney. Investigative experience
After spending 1988 and 1989 in private practice, he joined the staff of Attorney-General Richard Thornburgh, and his star rose at the Justice Department as the head of the criminal division under President George Bush's father from 1990 to 1993. He supervised such high profile cases as the prosecution of Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega and organised crime boss John Gotti.
And he led the investigations of the 1991 collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International banking and the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103. He joined a private Washington firm in 1993, but in 1995, he left private practice, joining the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia as a senior litigation counsel in the homicide section.

Irwin death film 'will never air'
Terri and Steve Irwin were married in 1992 and had two children
Bindi Irwin's tribute
Footage of Australian naturalist Steve Irwin's death will never be broadcast, his widow Terri has said in her first interview since his 4 September death.
"What purpose would that serve?" she asked presenter Barbara Walters in an interview with US programme 20/20.
"Crocodile Hunter" Irwin was killed by a stingray during a diving expedition off the Australian coast.
His wife, however, insisted his death was just a "stupid" accident - "like running with a pencil".
The American-born Irwin said she would continue to work in the field of wildlife conservation and was coping with her grief "one minute at a time".
The pre-recorded interview will be broadcast in the US and Australia on Wednesday.
'Masterfully planned'
The 42-year-old mother of two said her late husband knew he would not live a long life.
Irwin (centre) was not with her husband at the time of his death "He'd talk about it often," she said. "But it wasn't because of any danger from wildlife. He just felt life could be dangerous."
She also pledged to maintain the Australia Zoo in Beerwah, Queensland, which she co-owned with her late husband.
"He planned all of that masterfully," she continued. "He planned this wonderful business so that it could continue if anything happened to him."
Plans are in place to rename the road that runs past the zoo Steve Irwin Way by the end of the year.
Queensland state leader Peter Beattie said it would be "the first step in helping to build a lasting memorial" to the exuberant TV personality.

US tacitly backs Israel offensive
By Kim Ghattas
BBC News, Washington
Some 320 Gazans have been killed since Saturday, the UN says
The White House has given its tacit backing to Israel's military operation against Hamas and the Gaza Strip, a flare-up that is threatening to seriously complicate any peace efforts envisaged by the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama.
"The United States understands that Israel needs to take actions to defend itself," said White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe.
"In order for the violence to stop, Hamas must stop firing rockets into Israel and agree to respect a sustainable and durable ceasefire."
It is an attitude that is very similar to the one adopted by the Bush administration during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon - calling for a sustainable cease-fire and a lasting peace rather than pressuring Israel to immediately halt a military operation that was killing civilians.
Short of a dramatic development, observers expect no shift in this position - or the administration's support for Israel - during the remaining three weeks of President George W Bush's term in office.
Mr Bush has not made any public comments so far, and neither has his secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. But the state department has been keen to stress diplomatic efforts are underway to bring the crisis under control.
"We are encouraging all the nations in the region to take an active part in rebuilding the cease-fire so that we can return to the relative calm that was enjoyed in the region over the past six months," said state department spokesman Gordon Duguid.
He listed all the foreign leaders that Ms Rice had spoken to, from Tzipi Livni, her Israeli counterpart, to Saudi Foreign Minister Saud el-Faisal.
"We are working for a cease-fire now where Hamas must stop its rocket attacks on Israel," said Mr Duguid. "All sides then need to respect the ceasefire."
Bush failure
This is also in line with the approach taken by the Bush administration during its second term, according to Dan Senor, a former Bush administration official now working with the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) - with the White House making strong statements in support of Israel while Condoleezza Rice leans a bit more strongly on Israel. RUN-UP TO GAZA RAIDS
Shaky Egyptian-brokered six-month truce between Hamas and Israel agreed on 19 June
Palestinian rocket fire and Israeli operations in Gaza reduced
Violence resumes on 4 Nov as Israel launches incursion which it says targets Hamas tunnel; Palestinians respond with rocket fire
Hostilities increase; Israel tightens blockade on Gaza
Truce expires on 19 Dec; both sides blame each other for its breakdown; rocket fire increases
Israel launches major air strikes on 27 Dec
The flare-up also highlights the failure of Mr Bush to bring about a peace agreement between Palestinians and Israelis.
After he launched his ambitious Annapolis peace initiative in 2007, few believed anything concrete would come out of it, but some argued that at least Mr Bush was leaving behind a work-in-progress, with relative calm on the ground.
Instead, the last few weeks of his presidency will be mired in yet another crisis - the biggest Israeli offensive against Gaza in decades.
While the escalation was pegged to a date - the end of a six-month cease-fire on 19 December - both the Israelis and Hamas seem to be using the political calendar in Israel and the US to reshuffle the cards before the next administration comes in.
Israeli officials know they can count on the Bush administration's support but are less sure about how an Obama administration would have reacted were they to have launched this operation after 20 January.
Mr Senor also argued that Israel did not want a flare-up in Gaza to be the first issue that Mr Obama would have to contend with when he moved into the White House.
"There was a sense in Israel that action was needed as the cease-fire was set to expire and they had to either move quickly or wait a long time - four or six months - and that was not something Israel could deal with," he said.
No details
But the developments are on such a scale that even if calm returns in a few days, the crisis will have an impact, possibly even regional, that will last beyond 20 January, so the Middle East is forcing itself high onto the agenda of the incoming administration. Grief and fear in GazaAid worker diary: Gaza raids Rocket attacks plague Israeli towns
Mr Obama has often said he would tackle the challenge of Middle East peace from day one, but has not given many details on how he plans to reach the peace deal that has eluded the Clinton and Bush administrations.
Israel's military operation in Gaza is also likely to limit his room for manoeuvre and diplomacy, at least in the beginning.
Mr Obama's team, stressing that there is only one president at a time, has kept its statements about the crisis to a minimum, but has provided assurances of its support for Israel.
"He's going to work closely with the Israelis," said David Axelrod, a senior advisor to Mr Obama. "They're a great ally of ours, the most important ally in the region."
"But he will do so in a way that will promote the cause of peace and work closely with the Israelis and the Palestinians on that, towards that objective," Mr Axelrod told the CBS Sunday talk show Face the Nation.
Steve Coll, a senior CFR fellow on Middle Eastern studies, said the Israelis were trying to do everything they could to get political cover from the incoming administration by highlighting statements by the president-elect, such as the one he made in August in Sderot, the Israeli town targeted by Hamas rocket attacks.
"If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night, I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that," said Mr Obama during the visit. "And I would expect Israelis to do the same thing."
Gaza may well be that first international crisis that Vice President-elect Joe Biden predicted Mr Obama would have to face when he came into office, with both Israel and Hamas testing the incoming leader.
And while there is a reasonable amount of good will awaiting Mr Obama in the Arab world, how he handles similar flare-ups during his presidency will determine how long the honeymoon lasts.

'I went to every day of evidence at the Bloody Sunday inquiry'
Mickey McKinney says the Saville Inquiry has 'taken over his life'
By Judy Fladmark
BBC News
It cost £200m and took 12 years to complete, now the findings of the Saville Inquiry into Bloody Sunday will finally be published on Tuesday. But what was it like to sit through every single day of evidence?Day in, day out, week in, week out, year in, year out. Mickey McKinney had no idea one day would change his entire life and dominate it for so long. On 30 January, 1972, his older brother William, aged 27, was shot and killed in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, when British soldiers opened fire on crowds during a civil rights demonstration. He was one of 13 men to die on the day; another died weeks later from his injuries. That day became known as Bloody Sunday.
William, who died on Bloody Sunday
Next week, the Saville Inquiry - ordered by Tony Blair in 1998 after a long campaign by the bereaved - will deliver its findings into the deaths. Mr McKinney has sat through every single day of evidence - equivalent to five years in total - in the longest and most expensive state-funded investigation in British legal history. He has watched 922 witnesses give evidence, including the prime minister in 1972, Sir Edward Heath, 33 policemen, 245 soldiers, 35 IRA or former paramilitary members and seven priests. And when the inquiry switched from Londonderry to London for just over a year, due to fears over the safety of the military witnesses giving evidence, he became a long-distance commuter so as not to miss a thing. "It has taken over my life, it's there all the time and I won't get away from it until I see the report," he says. Each part has been difficult to deal with for different reasons, he says. When the inquiry was in Derry, five days a week he had to walk past the spot where his brother died to get the Guildhall to listen to the evidence. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Mickey McKinney on the events of the day and following the inquiry
In 2001 the Court of Appeal ruled the evidence of military witnesses should not be heard there, and so in 2002 the venue switched to the Central Hall in Westminster. It's a decision Mr McKinney felt was wrong. "Derry should have been the place where everyone concerned gave their evidence." Nonetheless, for just over a year he flew to London every Sunday night and continued to attend the inquiry five days a week. He stayed in a hotel near the venue, flying home again each Friday. Relatives of others who died on Bloody Sunday did the same, but it was still a lonely and isolated existence. "You weren't free to be with your family." Inner strengthAfter breakfast, he would walk to Central Hall and listen to the evidence, which was often upsetting. He remembers the quiet times in the evenings when the inquiry had finished for the day. He would go to his hotel room, get dinner and just sit there. Mr McKinney was one of two family liaison officers funded by a human rights group for the duration of the inquiry. As well as his own personal pain, he was there to support the other families through theirs.
Those who died on Bloody Sunday
"It took a toll on me. You were doing two jobs in one, trying to be a number of things to a number of people." The inquiry covered his travel and hotel expenses, but the emotional cost was huge. He says he had to draw on his inner strength to get through all the years of evidence. "I never dreamt that I would be involved in anything like this," he says. "I discovered a strength that I didn't know was there. All the families found an inner strength to get through this." The inquiry was set up to re-examine the events of that day. The initial Widgery report - published weeks after the killings - exonerated the soldiers of blame, concluded civilians had fired on the troops first and some victims had been handling weapons. It was dubbed a whitewash by the victims' families, who campaigned for a public inquiry to clear their loved ones' names. There have been highs and lows during the course of the inquiry, says Mr McKinney. He is glad it has made people "account for their actions on the day". But some evidence he found exceptionally hard to hear, especially that of the soldier suspected of shooting his brother. "That was a very painful day," he says. And he's found it frustrating to wait so long for the findings, although he realises the inquiry has been as thorough as possible with so many witnesses. "Anxiety levels are heightened as the days and weeks go past. We are in limbo and it's just sitting and watching the clock now." He hopes the publication will give some kind of closure to the relatives. "But again it depends on what Lord Saville puts in his report. It's only when we know what his recommendations are, that I can put closure on this."

Celtic partners lodge Euro 2008 bid
Hampden Park, in Glasgow, will be used in the bid
Football authorities in Scotland and Ireland have sealed their bid to host the Euro 2008 tournament.
Officials from the Football Association of Ireland travelled to Glasgow to sign the formal letter of application at Hampden Park on Thursday.
The move follows an 11th hour deal in Dublin, where Irish ministers agreed to delay a decision on which stadia would be used.
I am absolutely confident that both sides can produce a first-class bid which can produce the best championships ever
Jack McConnellFirst Minister Under the joint bid Ireland will provide two of the eight stadia required to host the tournament.
However, plans for a new national stadium - dubbed The Bertie Bowl - sparked a row between Ireland's two governing parties.
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern wants the project to go ahead but his junior coalition partners are opposed to the expense.
After the last-minute talks in Dublin the two parties have agreed that a steering group will now look at all the options over the next few months.
These include upgrading Lansdowne Road and borrowing Gaelic football's 80,000-seater Croke Park.
Deadline
The Gaelic Athletic Association has now agreed to review its ban on other sports.
The compromise allowed football bosses to meet Thursday's deadline for confirming bids for the event.
Scotland's First Minister Jack McConnell said: "I am absolutely delighted the Irish government have done exactly what they said they would do, and come in by the deadline.
"We now have a good bid and this is a very exciting time for football.
The Tartan Army has been consulted
"I am absolutely confident that both sides can produce a first-class bid which can produce the best championships ever.
"It is a time to be positive and put the cynicism and suspicion behind us."
Mr McConnell spoke to the Taoiseach on Thursday and received a letter confirming the Irish Government's backing.
The two countries will now put together the bid document, giving details of the stadia and the infrastructure, which must be submitted by 31 May.
The breakthrough was described as "excellent news" by the Scottish Football Association.
Jack McConnell's handling of it has threatened the bid's credibility and come close to scuppering our chances
John SwinneySNP leader It has also been welcomed by opposition politicians in Scotland - despite criticism of the way the process was handled.
And former first minister Henry McLeish, who was in favour of a solo bid when he was in office, said he was delighted by the Irish Government's decision to get on board.
"It is tremendous news for both countries and tremendous news for football. Clearly there are more difficulties with a joint bid, but it can succeed. "We saw that with the Dutch and Belgians last time and there is no reason we can't have a very good bid if we get down to detailed planning," said Mr McLeish.
He added that it was important to be positive. But he said he recognised the pitfalls of a joint bid, including dealing with two football associations, one executive and one government.
Credibility 'threatened'
Mr McLeish said if successful Scotland would benefit from an economic boost and both countries would enhance their international standing.
Scottish National Party leader John Swinney said he was "relieved" that the bid would go ahead.
"It has not, however, been the best of starts," he said.
"Jack McConnell's handling of it has threatened the bid's credibility and come close to scuppering our chances.
Brian Monteith welcomed the news
"We must make now sure that our bid is first class and that there is no lack of ambition from the Scottish Executive."
Scottish Conservative sports spokesman Brian Monteith said a "disaster" had been averted.
"An excellent opportunity for Scotland to host one of the world's most widely watched sporting events almost lay in tatters," he said.
"Let's hope that bid troubles are behind us and we can get on with winning for the football fans and economies of Scotland and Ireland."
He said "dither and delay" by the executive were to blame for the bid being in "jeopardy" on Wednesday.
"The executive has taken what should have been a simple task and almost turned it into a humiliating fiasco," he said.

New glacier theory on Stonehenge
The debate over how the stones arrived at Stonehenge continues
A geology team has contradicted claims that bluestones were dug by Bronze Age man from a west Wales quarry and carried 240 miles to build Stonehenge.
In a new twist, Open University geologists say the stones were in fact moved to Salisbury Plain by glaciers.
Last year archaeologists said the stones came from the Preseli Hills.
Recent research in the Oxford Journal of Archaeology suggests the stones were ripped from the ground and moved by glaciers during the Ice Age.
Geologists from the Open University first claimed in 1991 that the bluestones at one of Britain's best-known historic landmarks had not come from a quarry, but from different sources in the Preseli area.
The recent work was conducted by a team headed by Professor Olwen Williams-Thorpe, who said she and her colleagues had used geochemical analysis to trace the origins of axe heads found at Stonehenge and this backed up the original work.
There has been a great reluctance to allow facts to interfere with a good story
Dr Brian John
"We concluded that the small number of axes that are actually bluestone derive from several different outcrops within Preseli," she said.
"Axes found at or near Stonehenge are very likely to be from the same outcrops as the monoliths, and could even be made of left-over bits of the monoliths."
The research Archaeologists claimed the stones came from a quarry at Carn Menyn
Dr Brian John, a geomorphologist living in Pembrokeshire, said he always thought the idea that Bronze Age man had quarried the stones and then taken them so far "stretched credibility".
But he said the debate would go on until someone was able to prove beyond doubt what happened one way or the other.
"This is very exciting, and it moves the bluestone debate on from the fanciful and unscientific assertions of the past," he said.
"Much of the archaeology in recent years has been based upon the assumption that Bronze Age man had a reason for transporting bluestones all the way from west Wales to Stonehenge and the technical capacity to do it.
"That has been the ruling hypothesis, and there has been a great reluctance to allow facts to interfere with a good story.
"Glaciers may move very slowly, but they have an excellent record when it comes to the transport of large stones from one part of the country to another."

Zambia 1-1 Tunisia
By Stephen Fottrell
Zambia and Tunisia were evenly matched for much of the 90 minutes
Zambia and Tunisia contested a tight and evenly matched 1-1 draw in Lubango in the last of the opening group games.Zambia went ahead on 18 minutes when striker Jacob Mulenga hit a first-time effort past Tunisian keeper Aymen Mathlouthi, who should have saved. Tunisia equalised on 40 minutes, after Youssef Msakni broke into the box to square to Souheil Dhaouadi, who smashed the ball into the roof of the net. The draw condemns Cameroon to bottom of Group D, after their loss to Gabon. The Zambians were comfortable in possession throughout the first half with Tunisia struggling to find their rhythm. But the Carthage Eagles came out blazing in the second half with left-back Yassin Mikari seeing a fine shot from distance crash against the post on 47 minutes. Two minutes later Mikari picked out midfielder Oussama Darragi who forced a near-post save from Zambian goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene. Both sides had opportunities to win a tight contest in Lubango
The Chipolopolo gradually clawed their way back into the second period, testing the uncertain Mathlouthi with several in-swinging balls. Defender Kampamba Chintu should have done better when he found himself in space in the box but drove wide. The two sides were then overcome by a bout of caution later in the second half, with both reluctant to go for the win at the cost of losing their opening game. Mulenga, however, sought to steal all three points on 82 minutes, but smacked his left-foot effort into the side netting. Two minutes later substitute Zambia striker Emmanuel Mayuka found the back of the net with his first touch, but was correctly adjudged off-side. Rainford Kalaba saw his injury-time free kick parried by Mathlouthi into the path of captain Chris Katongo, who could not keep his follow-up header down. Zambia next play Cameroon on Sunday, while Tunisia take on group leaders Gabon. "I hope we can knock Cameroon out of this tournament," Zambia's coach Herve Renard said after Wednesday's game. "But it won't be a battle of French coaches, it's just Zambia against Cameroon," Renard added, referring to his impending meeting with compatriot and Cameroon coach Paul Le Guen.Zambia: Mweene, Mbola, Nyirenda, Musonda, Felix Katongo, Chintu, Kalaba, Sunzu, Christopher Katongo, Jacob Mulenga, Chamanga (Mayuka 84).

Woodward warns World Cup stars
By Caroline Cheese
At the BBC Sports Personality awards
It doesn't matter who steps down or who is injured, it will be the same team without them
England coach Clive Woodward said he will not be guided by sentiment when selecting his squad for the first Six Nations match of 2004.
Some of the older members of the World Cup winning squad are expected to decide in the next two months whether to retire following England's momentous win in Sydney.
However, Woodward, who picked up the Coach of the Year gong at Sunday's BBC Sports Personality show, said they may not be guaranteed a place whatever decision they make.
"It doesn't matter who steps down or who is injured, it will be the same team without them," he told BBC Sport.
"I like to think that retiring on a foreign field in Sydney would be the last thing on their minds - but I've got to pick them, there will be no sentiment.
"If any of those players aren't the best players, regardless of World Cups or anything, they won't be selected.
"I think they will know very quickly once you're not there, you won't be missed for very long.
"The team will go on, we'll get someone else and we'll still win. That's the attitude."
However, Woodward added that he would like to see the World Cup winning players carry on until the end of the season.
Woodward named top coach
"I'll leave it up to the players now and whatever they do they get my full support," he said.
"But think about it logically, they're fully fit to play in a World Cup final in November, they should be fully fit to play in February. "So it doesn't seem to be the best decision to retire halfway through the season - I'd like them to carry on at least until the end of the Six Nations."
Feature: Woodward leads from the front
Woodward, who also coached the side to the Six Nations Grand Slam glory and an unbeaten tour down under, described the current period as a "golden age for English rugby".
"It's been a wonderful 12 months but I think it goes a bit longer than that," he said.
"We've had an outstanding three or four years but this year has been incredible and I'm a bit worried about 2004 and how we're going to better this."
