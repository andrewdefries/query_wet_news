Tuvalu braces for high tides
by Phil Mercer
BBC in Sydney
The tiny South Pacific nation of Tuvalu is bracing itself for the onset of unusually high 'King Tides'.
Tuvalu's atolls are only a few metres above sea level
Homes, offices and part of the airport have been flooded, not by water washing over the coastline, but by worrying springs of sea water.
Locals say it is a further reminder that the country, comprising nine coral atolls lying between Australia and Hawaii, could one day disappear beneath the waves of the Pacific ocean. These are nervous times for one of the smallest and most remote countries on earth. None of Tuvalu's atolls are more than 4.5 metres above sea level.
Weather forecasters have predicted the "King Tides" will peak at about three metres.
With such little breathing space, locals are grateful that severe storms are not expected to pass through their isolated part of the South Pacific. The worst of the flooding so far has occurred in the centre of the main atoll, where villagers have stood ankle deep in seawater bubbling from the soil in areas normally used for growing crops.
Larger tides are expected in the next 24 hours. Tuvalu is a local word meaning "group of eight" referring to the number of traditionally inhabited islands.
The authorities have long insisted the risk from rising sea levels caused by global warming will one day force the evacuation of the country's 11,000 mainly-Polynesian residents.
The government in Tuvalu has failed to convince its larger neighbours Australia and New Zealand to offer its people sanctuary, should the high tides eventually swamp these tiny Pacific atolls.

Global Crossing files for bankruptcy
Global Crossing: Cash injection from Hong Kong and Singapore
Global Crossing, the US high-speed communications provider, has filed for bankruptcy protection.
The filing represents one of the biggest ever failures of a telecoms company, following several months of intense speculation about the company's financial position, during which the company's shares have plunged. Global Crossing
Assets: $22.4bn
Liabilities: $12.4bn
Share price: down 96% in past year Under the so-called Chapter 11 procedure, Global Crossing will be granted protection from its creditors while it uses new funds to restructure. The company said it would receive a $750m (�532m) cash injection from Hong Kong-based conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies Telemedia. "We have a new business plan which begins to address many of the concerns that we have had with our cost structures," Dan Wagner, president of Global Crossing Europe, told the BBC's World Business Report, adding that this will enable them "to eventually become a profitable business".
Even as Global Crossing tries to portray the filing as a reprieve or a new start for the company, it is hard to escape the fact that "billions of dollars of investors' funds have disappeared down an electronic plughole," the BBC's Mark Gregory said. Debts
Part of Global Crossing's troubles came from debts built up developing its global network of fibre optic cables, which links more than 200 cities in 27 countries. Telecom failures
Global Crossing: $25.5bn
360 Networks: $5.6bn
Winstar Communications: $5bn
PSINet: $4.5bn
Exodus Communications: $3.9bn
Figures cited are pre-bankruptcy assetsSource: Bankruptcydata.com
The company had been attempting to renegotiate the debts. On Monday, Global Crossing said it had $22.4bn in assets and $12.4bn in liabilities.
Formed in 1999 from a merger between a Bermuda-based fibre-optic cable specialist and a local US telecoms operator, Global Crossing was regarded as one of the most promising of the new generation of telecoms companies that sprang up in the late 1990s. The combined company had secured a stock market value of $75bn. But the economic slowdown - which hit global telecoms spending - and an increase in competition, together with heavy debts, hit the company hard. In December, amid much speculation about a bankruptcy filing, it was reported that Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing might invest as much as $1bn in the company. Deutsche Telekom was also reported to be among parties considering providing funding. Down 96%
Global Crossing reported losses of $3.4bn for the three months to September, and announced plans to axe a total of 3,200 jobs. Its next quarterly results statement is due on 26 February. Trading in the company's shares was halted for the bankruptcy announcement. The shares have fallen about 96% over the past year, finishing last week at 51 cents. WATCH/LISTEN

Serbia war crimes suspects held
Most of the Podujevo victims were women or children
Serbian police have arrested four former members of the elite Scorpions paramilitary group for suspected war crimes against ethnic Albanians.
The four men are accused of gunning down 14 civilians in Podujevo, northern Kosovo, in March 1999, says Serbian war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic.
The arrests were made in the town of Sremska Mitrovica, 80 km (55 miles) northwest of Belgrade, on Friday.
The killings came at the start of Nato's bombing campaign against Serbia.
The campaign ended the country's onslaught against the area's ethnic Albanian separatists.
Most of the victims of the massacre were women and children.
The Scorpions were reputed to be one of the most brutal Serb paramilitary groups active during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.
Sasa Cvijetan, another former Scorpion member, has already been convicted for his role in the Podujevo killings and is serving a 20-year jail sentence.

1974: Dozens die as Israel retaliates for Ma'alot
Israeli planes have bombed seven Palestinian refugee camps and villages in southern Lebanon killing at least 27 people and leaving 138 injured.
The attack was in retaliation for yesterday's hostage crisis at a school in Ma'alot near the Lebanon border in which 18 teenagers were killed and 70 were wounded.
Worst hit by the Israeli fighter-bombers were the crowded refugee camps of Ein El Helweh near the city of Sidon and Nabatieh.
An official announcement from the Israeli Defence Force said the planes had been aiming at offices and training bases used by the Popular Democratic Front, led by Nayef Hawatmeh, and the Popular Front under Ahmed Jibril. The PDF was behind the killing of the schoolchildren at Ma'a lot - and the Popular Front planned the shooting of 16 civilians in Kiryat Shemona on 10 April.
Two nights ago, three Palestinian Arabs dressed as Israeli soldiers took over the school at Ma'alot. There were more than 100 children aged between 14 and 16 sleeping there on the floor after a day's hiking in the region. Some managed to escape through an open door.
The Israeli Government agreed to the hostage-takers' demands to release 26 political prisoners, including a Japanese national involved in the Lod airport massacre. But negotiations fell apart when the hostage-takers did not receive a coded message they were waiting for from Damascus.
On 15 May at 1745 local time - 15 minutes before they had said they would kill all the children if their demands were not met - Israeli soldiers raided the school building.
Eighteen children and the three Palestinians were killed in a bloody gun battle.
There were emotional scenes today at the funeral of the children in their home town of Safed. Many of the 10,000 mourners wailed and some shouted: "Death to the terrorists!" The Ma'alot tragedy has severely hampered peace efforts by US Secretary of State Dr Henry Kissinger. He has flown from Jerusalem to Damascus to meet Syrian leaders in the hope of reaching some kind of compromise over Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights.
In Context
It was attacks like the one at Ma'alot that led Israeli troops to invade Southern Lebanon in 1978. They pulled back to a self-declared "security zone" in 1985 from which they withdrew in May 2000. The Popular Democratic Front, now known as the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, continued its operations during the late 1970s, and saw a steady increase in its membership. But it began to distance itself from the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), and continued to oppose any kind of peace process. In the late 1990s its leader, Naif Hawatmeh, sought reconciliation with mainstream Palestinians. In February 1999, he shocked hardline Palestinians by shaking hands with the Israeli President Ezer Weizman at the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan.

Murali 'best bowler ever'
Muttiah Muralitharan has been revealed as the top Test bowler in history, ranking alongside top batsman Don Bradman, according to cricket bible Wisden.
Muralitharan has 437 Test wickets
Wisden's statistical analysis of every single Test match put the Sri Lankan three places ahead of his Australian spin rival Shane Warne.
Between them are New Zealand's Richard Hadlee, and Sydney Barnes, whose 189 for England between 1901/02 - 1913/14 brought an average of 16.43 - the lowest of 20th century Test cricketers.
Your say: Pick your top Test players
In 78 Tests, Muralitharan has 437 wickets - third behind Courtney Walsh and Warne - at an average of 23.52.
His ranking, "emphasises the lone-wolf role he has played in Sri Lankan cricket for so long," according to Wisden.com editor Steven Lynch.
Muralitharan, currently in Brisbane with the Sri Lanka side, was surprised by the news.
"No.1 is a great honour and I don't rank myself so high," he said.
The spinner has been dogged by accusations of throwing, but his bowling action has been cleared due to a congenitally deformed arm.
"What I have gone through shouldn't happen to any other bowler, whether it be Brett Lee or Shoaib Akhtar," he said.
"It is very hard to keep going when everyone is looking at you all the time but everything is past and gone."
Bradman without equal
Bradman is followed by Sachin Tendulkar of India and West Indian pair Viv Richards and Garfield Sobers. Australia's Allan Border, with the most Test career runs with 11,174, is fifth.
The list's compilers took such factors as the strength of opposition and the importance of each performance. Players were also rewarded for consistency over long careers.
"The expected score for a top performer was around 1000 points - and The Don managed 1349," said Lynch.
"Just like his fabulous Test batting average of 99.94, this deservedly left him way clear of the field."
Wisden caused controversy two years ago when its statistical ranking of the top 100 Test innings did not include a single appearance by Indian legend Tendulkar.
Richards was reckoned the best batsman in one-day international cricket, while Pakistan's Wasim Akram is the best limited-overs bowler.
Test batting 1 DG Bradman (Aus) 1349.0 pts 2 SR Tendulkar (Ind) 921.5 3 IVA Richards (WI) 913.9 4 GA Sobers (WI) 912.0 5 AR Border (Aus) 911.2 Test bowling 1 M Muralitharan (SL) 1320.4 2 RJ Hadlee (NZ) 1232.9 3 SF Barnes (Eng) 1209.3 4 SK Warne (Aus) 1195.8 5 CV Grimmett (Aus) 1184.8 ODI batting 1 IVA Richards (WI) 1132.5 2 SR Tendulkar (Ind) 1119.3 3 BC Lara (WI) 1036.8 4 DM Jones (Aus) 1022.1 5 MG Bevan (Aus) 1016.7 ODI bowling 1 Wasim Akram (Pak) 1223.5 2 AA Donald (SA) 1180.1 3 Waqar Younis (Pak) 1167.1 4 GD McGrath (Aus) 1165.9 5 J Garner (WI) 1160.7 See also:
