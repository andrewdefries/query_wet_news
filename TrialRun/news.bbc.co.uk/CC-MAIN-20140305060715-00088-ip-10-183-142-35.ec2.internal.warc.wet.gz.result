US Catholics demand greater church role
Some Catholics are pushing for women to be ordained
By Rob Watson
BBC Washington correspondent
America's Roman Catholic bishops are holding their annual conference in Dallas at a time of unprecedented crisis for the Catholic Church in the United States.
But despite the revelations over the past few months of sex scandals involving priests, America's Catholics are not deserting their church. We will break from Rome if Rome does not see the light
Anne Barrett Doyle, Coalition of Concerned Catholics At St Mary's in Boston, the city where the crisis began, the Sunday evening mass for youngsters is as well-attended as ever.
Rory Flynn is among the teen worshippers. He told me that Catholics should hold onto their faith despite what has happened. "You can't lose your faith, because your faith is not in the priest, it's in Jesus who died on the cross for us," he says.
Zero tolerance
"As disgusting as it was - I prayed for the families - you can't lose your faith."
But many Catholics have lost their faith in the men who rule their church. With a mix of humour and anger, scores of protesters continue to picket Boston Cathedral every Sunday. Among the regulars is Anne Barrett Doyle, founder of the Coalition of Concerned Catholics. She is demanding a policy of zero tolerance from the church towards abusive priests and has a stern warning if her demands are ignored.
Some are threatening to break with Rome
"There is a lot of talk among very sensible conservative people like myself about forming an American Catholic Church," she says. "We will break from Rome if Rome does not see the light, if Rome continues to defend priests rather than defend victims."
But most Catholics want to reform their church, not leave it. Leading this mini-reformation is a grassroots organisation called Voice of the Faithful, which has swelled to over 10,000 strong in the few months since the crisis began. The group is pretty conservative - most members are pressing merely for a greater say by ordinary Catholics in the way the church is run.
But some, like Jan Leary, are more radical.
"If we had married priests in place, especially women priests, and women who were mothers and grandmothers, this would have stopped the issue of any kind of hurt for children," she says.
Potential for change
Out in the parishes, reform-minded priests like Father Walter Cuenin of Boston's Our Lady of Christians church worry that without change, the Catholic Church could lose its central role in the community.
"We have a very vibrant Catholic Church. I would hate to see that lost," he says.
He says one of the ways to make sure that it does not get lost is to create mechanisms so that people feel and do have a greater voice in the life of the church. "Take the issue of selection of bishops, for example. There needs to be some way in which the priests, as well as lay people, have a voice in that process," he says.
"Now, it's just an old-boy network through Rome."
But in a sign of the times, even Boston College, a former bastion of Catholic orthodoxy, is planning seminars on Church reform. Academics there, like Professor Tom O'Connor, are hopeful that all the pain of the sex scandals may not have been in vain.
"One of the progressive features to come out of this is suddenly, the Catholic Church is important," Mr O'Connor says. "People who perhaps once assumed elements of their faith in a sort of off-hand manner are now being forced back into asking themselves the question, 'Well what is it that I do believe?' "These things mean that there is a vitality there, and that kind of vitality means that there is potential for change and progressive reform."
Certainly, this week's meeting of US bishops is expected to issue tough new guidelines on abusive priests, as church spokesman Father William Maistry explains.
"I think the majority of bishops are in favour of zero tolerance - that is, one offence, one abuse of a minor, past or present and the priest can no longer function as a priest," he says.
No matter how tough the bishops get on sex abuse, their conference will not be enough to restore the trust that has been broken between America's Catholics and their clergy. That, the Church here acknowledges, will take more than two days of apologies and debate in Dallas.

Dell warns sales missed forecast
Competition in the personal computer market is fierce
Dell, the world's largest maker of personal computers, has warned that sales have missed its forecasts amid weaker demand in the US and UK. Sales were $13.9bn (�9.6bn) in the three months to the end of September, compared with a forecast of $14.10bn.
Dell, a tech industry bellwether, also said it would take a charge of $450m related to fixing faulty computers.
Shares of Dell, which is fighting stiff competition, fell more than 5% in after hours electronic trading in New York.
The company is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings figures on 10 November. Tight times
Dell has been cutting costs and looking to increase sales of more profitable products as it battles rival computer makers including Hewlett-Packard. Analysts said that notebook computer sales had risen, but not by enough to offset a dip in demand for its larger desk top products. Shares of Dell have been under pressure during the past few months, losing almost a fifth of their value during the third quarter as investors buy into rivals with better growth prospects. In contrast, Hewlett-Packard's shares are up by a third this year in the wake of its appointment of a new chief executive.

The lowdown on having a healthy pregnancy
A baby tucks in, but pregnant women should watch their diet
Pregnancy is hard work despite all the images of blooming mothers-to-be. All your organs are squashed up into your throat, you can hardly walk and you may get double vision. And then there is the stress of worrying about the future health of your baby. As part of National Pregnancy Week, beginning on 6 September, childbirth charity Tommy's Campaign and Boots the Chemists are publishing a guide to how expectant mothers and babies can keep healthy.
The top 10 tips are:
Eat a balanced diet, including cereals, bread, oily fish and cooked eggs. Stay clear of raw eggs, soft, unpasteurised cheese, pate and uncooked meat. Pregnant women should also avoid eating too many foods high in vitamin A, such as liver and dairy products, in combination with multi-vitamin supplements which include vitamin A. Excessive doses of vitamin A have been shown to be a risk factor for heart defects and cleft palates in babies, but too little is also harmful to a baby's health.
Both men and women trying for a baby should consider stopping smoking as research shows an increased risk of health problems for unborn babies. Smoking is also believed to have an effect on male fertility. Recent research shows that the babies of women who smoke during pregnancy have a greater risk of developing cancer in later life.
Women should take folic acid supplements in the weeks leading up to conception and after conception. This can reduce the chance of birth defects, such as Spina Bifida.
The recommended daily dose is 400 microgrammes. Too much folic acid can be harmful. The vitamin is found in beans and green, leafy vegetables.
Pregnant women should cut down on the amount of alcohol they drink as excessive amounts can be risky for the foetus. One or two units a week is the recommended limit.
Pregnant women should contact their GP if they are worried about complications, such as bleeding, swelling of the ankles, abdominal pain and headaches.
Expectant mothers should avoid prescribed drugs and over the counter medicines unless advised otherwise by their doctor. They should also avoid hard drugs.
Women should try to relax, particularly if they have had problems in previous pregnancies. Research shows exhaustive work can bring on premature labour.
Uncooked meat and cat litter should be avoided or handled carefully as there is a risk of contracting toxoplasmosis, an infection which can cause brain defects in an unborn child.
Regular visits to ante-natal clinics will allow pregnant women to get advice on how to stay healthy.
The booklets are available from GP surgeries, Boots shops and ante-natal clinics. Boots and Tommy's Campaign are also launching a website for expectant fathers.
This will feature the top 10 questions dads-to-be want answered. According to a survey by Tommy's Campaign, these include whether it is safe to have sex during pregnancy, whether they will be put off by their partner's changing shape and whether they should attend the birth.

Hope and rusty guns in Niger Delta
After years of fighting in the Niger Delta, some militants have begun to hand in weapons as part of a government amnesty programme. But as Caroline Duffield discovers the outbreak of peace might not be all that it seems. Gen Boyloaf wants a fairer share of the region's oil wealth for local people
"My name is Ebikabowei Victor Ben. Aka 'General Boyloaf'." From a man in a baseball cap and a polo shirt it sounded odd. He slumped on a cream Louis XVI sofa. "Do you want a Heineken?" he asked. The luxury room he had been given in the grounds of Government House glittered with mirrors, marble tables and gilded chairs. "We must give peace a chance and we will keep to our side of the bargain," he added, flicking cigarette ash into a beer can. The self-styled General Boyloaf has commanded the loyalty of thousands of young men in the Niger Delta. He is the guerrilla tactician behind crippling attacks on the oil companies and Nigerian army. But today, he was ordering his men to give up their weapons - or so it seemed. Rusty weaponsI had waited hours in the heat for Boyloaf with swarms of his young supporters outside the local government headquarters, all of them pushing, dancing, yelling, and singing.
Nigerian militants handed in weapons as part of an amnesty programme
Enlarge Image Centre stage were stacks of weapons - piled up like matchsticks - and even a gunboat. Journalists tiptoed between rocket-propelled grenades, rifles and AK-47s. A lot were rusty. Not quite what you would want in your hand meeting the Nigerian army, but the crowd was euphoric. Boyloaf came out and promised the people of the Niger Delta would hold the government to its promises of development and jobs. He threw his arms around the state governor and they cheered. Behind me, two boys were talking. "Are they close?" asked one. "As close as the rainbow is to the rain," said the other. Poverty and politicsAnd that is the problem in the Niger Delta. The business of militancy and the business of power are linked. Militancy is rooted in community protests over poverty and pollution from the oil industry. And there is nothing in these towns. A village with a good road is lucky. If you want a job, you get one selling mobile phone credit, or water, or bananas on the roadside.
OIL THEFT
Oil theft costs Nigeria an estimated $5bn (£2.5bn) every year
Estimates of oil stolen range from 70,000 to 500,000 barrels per year
Nigeria has proven reserves of over 31bn barrels
Its production capacity is 3.2m barrels per day (bpd)
Its current production rate is 1.9m bpd
Source: Legaloil.com
But any political struggle here was long ago corrupted by the fat profits of kidnapping and oil theft. Politicians are partly to blame. They hired and armed young men as paid thugs to help them rig elections - and afterwards, the guns were turned on the politicians. Local government payrolls even include many militants. They intimidate politicians, demand jobs for friends, and attack the oil industry. But the real money is made in kidnapping and "bunkering", tapping into pipelines to steal oil. And everyone dips their fingers into the dirty game. Corrupt officials, corrupt politicians, and corrupt military officers all ease the path for ships full of stolen goods out of the military zone. Delta veterans whisper it quietly - "no such thing as a struggle exists, just criminals, politics and profits". But those profits are a long way from the boys watching guns being dumped. One of them introduces himself as Comrade Emmanuel. "I don't even have money inside my pocket," he cries. "I'm a Niger Delta son and I have no job to do. What's happening today is real. We're trusting the federal government for the last time. "I want a job. I want a girlfriend. Do I look like someone who can't work?" His bare feet are covered in sores and missing teeth make him look old. But he is in his early 20s and it is clear the profits of militancy do not trickle down. DenunciationAnd so how do you address a self-styled general when he retires? And was he really retiring? Are the rusting guns and mildewed camouflage jackets the real arsenal or are the real weapons still in the hands of the militants? As we sat on his Louis XVI sofa, phones in his various pockets began to bleat irritating tunes. Every big man in this country carries multiple phones. And a lot of people clearly need to speak to Boyloaf at once. "What? They go say what? Hold on," he raised his voice and talked to another handset. Judging from the fragments of the conversation, it was bad news. I later heard that he had been denounced by a faction of his own group. They had accused him publicly of mounting a fake disarmament, a charade, and they said that they would continue their struggle. Earlier, I had asked him whether the gun dumping was real. He looked me in the eye. "I disarmed all my munitions," he said. "Not one bullet is left." "And so why give up your guns first?" I asked. "You have not yet got the development, the jobs, everything you wanted." "We have promises. The government has promised. We will hold them to that." "And if they don't deliver?" I asked. He looked at me and his eyes were still. "Then the gods of the Niger Delta will come back," he said, "and they will repay them and fight for us."

Water power 'fuels climate change'
Nam Ngum dam in Laos: Hydro-electricity is not always green
By environment correspondent Alex Kirby
Hydro-electric power, often proclaimed as one of the greenest ways of generating energy, can be more polluting than coal.
This is because the reservoirs that power the dams can trap rotting vegetation, which emits large amounts of greenhouse gases.
But establishing just how much pollution a particular reservoir will cause is very difficult, because they vary widely.
The announcement of this cause of gas emission comes shortly before the next round of negotiations on how to tackle it.
The discovery of the full greenhouse potential of hydro-electric schemes, reported in New Scientist magazine, was made by the World Commission on Dams (WCD).
Clean claim
The commission, a group of scientists, engineers and environmentalists, is supported by the World Conservation Union and the World Bank, which is the single biggest funder of large dams.
Supporters of dams argue that they should qualify for support as a clean technology under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on tackling climate change.
Shallow reservoirs are bigger problems
Many scientists believe there is strong evidence to suggest that the Earth's atmosphere is warming, and that human activities - chiefly the burning of fossil fuels - are a significant cause.
The WCD will report its findings at a meeting in the German city of Bonn in June to discuss the Clean Development Mechanism, a key part of the Kyoto Protocol.
It says the decay of forests submerged when reservoirs are flooded produces only a fraction of the two gases involved, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane.
Much more is produced by organic matter washed into the reservoir from further upstream, a process which may continue for the lifetime of the reservoir.
Methane is 20 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2. It is given off by stagnant water, while running water, which contains oxygen, produces CO2.
Extensive problem
So a reservoir will produce more methane than the river which ran before the dam was built.
The WCD, which believes the problem is far more widespread than first thought, says the reservoirs that appear most at risk are shallow ones in the tropics which have not been cleared of biomass before they were flooded.
It says one particular cause for concern is the Balbina reservoir in Brazil, which in parts is only four metres deep.
Ariane: Power from a suspect source
Its generating capacity is 112 megawatts, and it is estimated to produce three million tonnes of CO2 annually over its first 20 years. A coal-fired power station of the same capacity would produce 0.35m tonnes of CO2 a year.
In French Guyana, the Petit-Saut reservoir, which has a similar capacity and powers the launch site for Europe's Ariane rocket, is expected to produce 0.9m tonnes of CO2 annually in its first 20 years.
The WCD has looked at only a few dams in four countries, and thinks there will be many similar examples.
But it says one study of nine Brazilian reservoirs found their greenhouse emissions varied per unit of electricity by a factor of 500.
It says: "There is no justification for claiming that hydro-electricity does not contribute significantly to global warming."

Terror on Sri Lankan faultline
Government troops have failed to provide security
By David Shukman in Ampara
An early morning patrol by the Sri Lankan forces guards the fault line on this troubled island. They are defending land that is only just under Government control. If the fighters of the Tamil minority get their way, it will be part of an independent
Tamil country.
The police took us into the heart of this contested territory. They wanted to show us what's been done in the name of a Tamil homeland. The terror they face every day. They took us to what they said is the site of a mass grave. The officers explained to me that over 50 villages were massacred several months ago by guerrillas of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). "The people who did this must be destroyed"
The victims lay buried in the soil. They were farming folk. And the same tools they lived by were used to slaughter them.
The survivors are traumatised. They are from the majority ethnic group in Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese, but found themselves on land claimed by the Tamil guerrillas and have now paid the price.
Tee Manike lost three of her four children. "They were cut up," she said, "and the men who did this must be destroyed." Failing to provide security
The security forces have been trying for 17 years to beat the Tamil guerrillas. But the killings that took place inside these houses show how far the Government is from winning. Tamil refugees resent government rule
The Sinhalese look to the authorities for protection. But, in this village, and many other places, they can not provide it.
Even with all this security, these villages are still too scared to stay here at night. This is the reality of life on the frontline in this conflict. The problem is that the harder the security forces try to clamp down on the Tamil Tigers and their terrorism the more many ordinary Tamils say they feel harassed and resentful. Hated Sri Lankan rule
Sri Lankan rule is hated in a Tamil refugee camp I visited. Water has to be carried from a Kilometre away
The drinking water has to be carried in from a kilometre away. Although this place was set up 10 years ago, it still has no power either.
These Tamil children are growing up poor and disillusioned. Many are malnourished and suffer the diseases of life in a camp. Their parents believe the authorities are against them. They say that because they are Tamils they have trouble finding work. They are picked on by the police.
These Tamils feel unwanted in Sri Lanka and want their own country instead. There is a Tamil dream in this impoverished land of creating a new nation. But, in the attempt to fulfil it, thousands more lives will be destroyed.

BBC News | UK | Born to raise Hell

You are in: UK Front Page World UK England Northern Ireland Scotland Wales UK Politics Business Sci/Tech Health Education Entertainment Talking Point In Depth AudioVideo Sonny Barger"There is no international leader of the Hell's Angels and there never has been."
real 28k	Monday, 14 August, 2000, 12:00 GMT 13:00 UK
Born to raise Hell
He has attempted murder, hangs out with racists and claims he once threatened to shoot a Rolling Stone. Now, one of the most notorious Hell's Angels has detailed the sleazy side of his life in a new book. By BBC News Online's Chris Summers
After years of drug abuse, brawling and motorbike crashes, it would be unrealistic to find Ralph "Sonny" Barger a picture of health.
But despite his gravelly voice - the legacy of a laryngectomy which removed a cancerous growth in his throat 19 years ago - the 62-year-old former President of the Oakland, California chapter of the Hell's Angels is no cause for pity and has no plans to slow down.
Barger has convictions for attempted murder, possession of narcotics with intent to sell and assault with a deadly weapon.
Law-enforcement agencies in the United States believe he is the international president of the Angels and claim they are one of the leading organised crime groups in the US. The Angels have also been accused of masterminding drug dealing operations in Europe, especially Scandinavia.
The club, as a whole, is not racist but we probably have enough racist members that no black guy is going to get in it
Sonny Barger
In the UK to promote his autobiography, Barger denies this and told BBC News Online: "It's FBI propaganda. It's just like the stuff they said after Waco." He said the Angels were no more a criminal organisation than the Branch Davidians.
Two years ago he moved to Arizona with his third wife, Noel, and his young daughter. Sarrah, but he still rides Harley-Davidsons and subscribes 100% to the Hell's Angels' philosophy.
Barger, who used to own a Harley-Davidson called Sweet Cocaine, believes all drugs should be legalised and says: "Why shouldn't they, after all they let you smoke cigarettes and they kill 400,000 people a year in the US?"
Three regrets
But he admits to having regrets in life.
"If I had my life over again I wouldn't smoke, I'd take less cocaine and I'd try not to lose my right to own a gun [in the US a convicted felon automatically loses this 'birthright']," he says.
Sonny Barger had an operation to remove a throat cancer
Barger had a tough childhood in working-class Oakland - his mother abandoned the family when he was very young and his father was a chronic alcoholic who left him in the care of his elder sister Shirley much of the time.
But he says: "I only realised in the last five years, when people told me about it, how hard it was. At the time I had a great time."
His main motivation for joining the Angels was to ride motorbikes and hang out with like-minded people who knew how to "party".
The first Hell's Angels club was formed in 1948 - the name derives from a World War II USAF bomber squadron - but Barger only joined in the late 1950s, when he helped form the Oakland chapter.
He became the most prominent member in California, coined the use of the Death's Head logo, and was one of those responsible for security at the infamous Rolling Stones concert in Altamont in 1969.
A black fan, Meredith Hunter, was stabbed to death by Angels as the gig descended into violence.
In his book Barger claims Keith Richards threatened to walk off the stage unless the Hell's Angels "cool it" and he says he stuck a pistol in the guitarist's ribs and ordered him to play...or else.
'Stones to blame'
Barger dodges the blame, claiming the Stones delayed their entrance unnecessarily.
"They agitated the crowd, had the stage built too low, and then used us to keep the whole thing boiling. They got exactly what they wanted - a dark, scary environment to play Sympathy for the Devil."
Post Altamont, the Angels were widely condemned for being racist. To this day they have no black members. But Barger says: "The club, as a whole, is not racist but we probably have enough racist members that no black guy is going to get in it."
There are thousands of Hell's Angels members in UK
He says Oakland is home to one of the largest black biker gangs, the Dragons, and points out: "They don't have any white members, but nobody calls them prejudiced."
The fact is that to be accepted as an Angel you have to be voted in unanimously by the existing members and as Barger says: "You're always going to have someone who says no."
By the same token, there are no female Hell's Angels.
Women are welcome in clubhouses and on runs but only on the basis of being wives or girlfriends, known as "old ladies".
We are male chauvinist pigs as far as women are concerned but we have a right to be because we want to be
Sonny Barger
"We are male chauvinist pigs as far as women are concerned but we have a right to be because we want to be,"says Barger.
In the 1960s Hunter S Thompson, the writer who penned Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, hung out with the Oakland chapter for a time, gaining a reputation with them as a "weeny and a coward". He later wrote a book about the experience which Barger claims was "exaggerated junk".
'Growing all the time'
Thompson was later beaten up by one of the Oakland Angels and Barger says: "Hunter S Thompson and the Stones are both very good at what they do, but that doesn't mean they're nice people."
He is also surprisingly dismissive of Harley-Davidsons.
"Everybody in the club rides Harleys but they would all admit they were a piece of junk, in terms of machinery."
He says the engineering on Japanese bikes is far superior, but riding Harleys is part tradition, part patriotism and partly due to the fact they produce that famous "grumble" and more low-end torque.
Everybody in the club rides Harleys but they would all admit they were a piece of junk, in terms of machinery
Sonny Barger
Despite moving to Arizona, Barger has no plans to hang up his motorbike boots or his Hell's Angel patch.
"It's virgin territory. We've got five brand new chapters there.
"It's not just about the bikes - they want to belong. They're looking for brotherhood, friendship and loyalty," he says.
Hell's Angel, The Life And Times of Ralph "Sonny" Barger is published by Fourth Estate.

Construction contracts exclusion
Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The assembly agreed to provide greater payment and fair treatment safeguards for sub-contractors in the construction industry, on 23 October 2012.The protection will come as a result of the passing of the Construction Contracts Exclusion Order (Northern Ireland) 2012. The DUP's Paul Girvan said the change "offered a common sense approach" and was "simply closing a loophole". Finance Minister Sammy Wilson said he wanted to highlight his "commitment to improving payment practices". "Given the importance of the construction industry, it is important that we keep the supply healthy and that payments are made on a regular basis, " he said. SEE ALSO

Airdrie United 1-1 Peterhead
Airdrie United had to settle for a share of the spoils after stubborn resistance from the Highland visitors.
Peterhead caught the hosts napping to take the lead after 33 minutes when Andrew Bagshaw's corner was headed home by Stuart Mackay at the near post.
Airdrie pressed hard and Allan Russell fired an angled shot into the net for the equaliser.
Peterhead substitute Graham Sharp almost stole all three points late on, but he could only drag his shot wide.
Airdrie Utd: Robertson, McKenna, Lovering, Smith, Smyth, McDonald, Noble (McDougall 67), McKeown, Russell, Holmes, Waddle (Prunty 53). Subs Not Used: Sharp, Donnelly, Hollis. Goals: Russell 55. Peterhead: Kula, Buchan, Mackay, Mann, MacDonald, Anderson, Bagshaw (Sharp 67), Kelly, Bavidge, Kozminski (Donald 90), McKay. Subs Not Used: Munro, Good, Will. Booked: MacDonald. Goals: Mackay 33.
