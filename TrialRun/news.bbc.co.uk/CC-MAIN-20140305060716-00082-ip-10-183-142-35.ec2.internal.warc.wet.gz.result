French shoppers resilient
Confidence falls, unemployment rises, yet people still shop
French consumer spending rose much faster than economists had predicted in September, but due to climbing unemployment the mood remained fairly pessimistic for the rest of the year.
"Given our pessimistic stance on the French labour market we expect consumption to weaken until the end of the year," said UBS Warburg economist Stephane Deo.
French unemployment rose throughout summer to reach 9% in August.
Lay-offs of workers and the closure of factories have dented the confidence of shoppers.
In September, household confidence fell to its lowest level since May 1998.
"Confidence is going to deteriorate but that consumption will resist quite well, even if it should ease a little, thanks to the government's efforts to lower taxes," said Nicolas Claquin, an economist at CCF.
Rising, not falling
Consumer spending rose by 0.2% in September, the statistics office INSEE said on Tuesday.
Analysts had expected a 0.9% fall.
"I think the consensus forecast was much too pessimistic, probably because people were expecting an 11 September impact," Mr Deo said.
"The information we were getting from companies was that the first weekend after the attacks was more or less normal."
Tax cut impact
During the third quarter of 2001 as a whole, consumer spending rose by a whopping 2.1% after having failed to grow at all during the second quarter.
Low inflation and tax cuts for low paid workers helped boost spending, said Mr Deo.
Government stimulus
Economists were not alone in painting a gloomy picture of the French economy.
Last week, the French government announced an economic stimulus package, slashed its growth forecast for 2001 to 2.1% from 2.3% and said its 2.5% target for 2002 may be tough to achieve.

BBC apologises over Queen clips
A still from the five-part programme
Controller apology
The BBC has apologised to the Queen for mistakenly showing footage that wrongly implied she walked out of a portrait session during a documentary.
The programme trailer showed the Queen in an exchange with photographer Annie Leibovitz, followed by a clip of her apparently walking off.
The footage, revealed to the press on Wednesday, was not intended to be seen and was shown in error, the BBC said.
The documentary, A Year With The Queen, will be shown later this year.
"The BBC would like to apologise to both the Queen and Annie Leibovitz for any upset this may have caused", the corporation said in a statement.
In a later joint statement, the BBC and production company RDF Media said the film had been edited out of sequence and supplied to the corporation in error.
Working life
Photographer Annie Leibovitz is seen in the trailer telling the Queen she will look better without her tiara because "the Garter robe is so..."
Before she can say "extraordinary", the Queen replies, pointing to what she is wearing: "Less dressy. What do you think this is?"
The clip then cuts to the Queen walking through the Palace saying to her lady-in-waiting: "I'm not changing anything. I've had enough dressing like this, thank you very much," implying she had stormed off from the portrait session.
But in fact, this clip was filmed before the photographs were taken.
Leibovitz is famous for her celebrity portraits
The trailer was shown to journalists at a press launch of the BBC's autumn schedule.
Stories describing what appeared to be the Queen walking out subsequently appeared widely, including on the BBC News website.
The BBC said the trailer was never intended to be seen by the public or the press and was shown to journalists "in error".
The footage had been supplied by production company RDF Media and the BBC had no idea it had been edited out of sequence, a joint statement from the BBC and RDF said.
"This assembly was never intended to be seen by the public or the press," the statement continued.
"Unfortunately, this assembly was given in error to the BBC personnel who were preparing the BBC One autumn launch tape."
RDF Media said it "would like to apologise to the Queen and Annie Leibovitz for this error". Controller of BBC One Peter Fincham used the sequence "in good faith" and had no knowledge that an error had been made, the statement added.
Her Majesty posed for Leibovitz in Buckingham Palace in March for a series of portraits to mark her state visit to the US.
'Remarkable access'
Four official portraits of the Queen have since been released by the famous photographer, renowned for celebrity shots including an iconic photo of a naked John Lennon embracing a clothed Yoko Ono.
The five-part documentary will start on BBC One in the autumn.
The programme observes the working life of the Queen and other members of the Royal Family as they go about their duties at home and abroad. The Blue Peter team apologised after the error was discovered
It covers events including the Queen's 80th birthday celebrations, the State Opening of Parliament, Royal tours, investitures and garden parties.
Mr Fincham said the BBC had had "remarkable access" to the Royal Family.
The incident comes in the same week the BBC was fined �50,000 after the results of a Blue Peter competition were faked last November. The show allowed a child visiting the studio to pose as a caller when technical problems stopped real calls getting through to the studio. Media watchdog Ofcom criticised the BBC for "negligence" and for "making a child complicit" in the deception. It is the first time Ofcom has imposed a financial penalty on the BBC for an editorial failure.

Red-haired family forced to move
Kevin Chapman says he was attacked in the street A Newcastle family claim they have been forced from two homes by thugs who have targeted them over their ginger hair.
Kevin and Barbara Chapman say they and their four children, aged between 10 and 13, have endured years of taunts, smashed windows and violence. They said they moved from Walker to Newbiggin Hall to try to escape the bullying, and then again to Kenton Bar.
Son Kevin, 11, said he was recently punched in a street attack. Newcastle Council is "discussing the situation".
Mr Chapman, 49, said his 10-year-old daughter Ryelle and sons Daniel, 10, and Jordan, 13, have also been badly affected. He said each time the family received abuse they moved home. They've been punched and kicked and thrown over a hedge
Father Kevin Chapman
The family also say they have endured their homes being daubed in graffiti.
Mr Chapman said: "The abuse we get is unbelievable. It started more than three years ago, when the kids started getting bullied by lads over the colour of their hair.
"They've been punched and kicked and thrown over a hedge. Every time they go out these gangs get to them."
He added that the family now wanted to move again.
Community police officer Sergeant Colin Murray, of Northumbria Police, said there had been a number of incidents all of which had been fully investigated.
Commenting on the matter, a Newcastle City Council spokesman said: "We are currently discussing their situation."
