Woodstock anniversary gig dropped
An estimated 400,000 people were at Woodstock in 1969
Woodstock promoter Michael Lang has abandoned plans for a free 40th anniversary gig after failing to find funding, Rolling Stone has reported.The US magazine said Mr Lang, one of four founders of the legendary festival, had failed to find sponsors to cover costs of up to $10m (£5.9m). He hoped to stage the gig in New York's Climate Week in September, it said. Jimi Hendrix closed the original event in Bethel, New York State, which took place from 15 to 18 August 1969. 'Big boost'Rolling Stone said Mr Lang had initially planned a concert in Brooklyn's Prospect Park during August. Money. No sponsors
Michael Lang gives his reasons for the cancellation
When that fell through, he had hoped to stage a festival to coincide with Climate Week NYC, which will run from 20 to 25 September as part of the international Seal the Deal campaign. The campaign aims to push governments towards agreeing a climate change pact at a December summit in Copenhagen, Denmark. "It would have been a big boost for the issue," he told Rolling Stone. Asked why his plans had been cancelled, he simply replied: "Money. No sponsors." Speaking about the anniversary show in March, Mr Lang said he hoped the bill would include some of the acts from the original line-up, including Joe Cocker and Santana.

Bhutto buried amid mass mourning
Mourners at the funeral in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh
Enlarge Image Tens of thousands of people have attended the funeral of assassinated Pakistani politician Benazir Bhutto.
Mourners converged on the family mausoleum where she was buried next to her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto near their home village in Sindh province.
The coffin, draped in the flag of Ms Bhutto's party, was driven in a white ambulance through the dense crowds.
Pakistan's interior ministry has said it has clear evidence al-Qaeda was behind the assassination.
It quoted intelligence intercepts in a briefing to reporters that followed a reported claim of responsibility by al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.
It said Ms Bhutto had died of a fracture in her neck and had not been hit by either bullets or shrapnel, as reported earlier when a gunman attacked her car at an election rally in Rawalpindi on Thursday.
Pakistani security forces are on high alert, with at least 24 people killed in protests by Bhutto supporters across the country since the assassination.
Slogans and tears
On Friday, Ms Bhutto's plain wooden coffin was taken from the family home to the burial site 7km (four miles) away at the village of Garhi Khuda Bakhsh.
Search for stability continuesShock in home provincePress mourns Bhutto
Amid weeping and beating of heads and chests, mourners jostled to see the coffin, which was accompanied by Ms Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari and her three children.
Her father, also a former national leader, was hanged in 1979 by an earlier Pakistani military government. Outside the triple-domed mausoleum, crowds chanted slogans blaming President Pervez Musharraf for Ms Bhutto's death.
The BBC's Owen Bennett-Jones, who is in the district of Larkana, says the mood among local people is one of anger and confusion.
Rioting and unrest has been reported across the country.
Six bodies were found among the remains of a factory set on fire in Karachi
At least one passenger train was set ablaze in Sindh Province and a number of railway stations were reportedly burnt as security forces in the province were ordered to shoot rioters on sight
The office of a pro-government party was ransacked and set ablaze in Peshawar
In the city of Multan in Punjab province, a mob ransacked seven banks and torched a petrol station
Other cities across Pakistan are at a virtual standstill. Schools, businesses and transport are all closed, and people are reluctant to step out during the three days of national mourning declared by Mr Musharraf. Musharraf under pressure
Plans for a general election on 8 January, for which Ms Bhutto had been campaigning when she was killed, remain unchanged, the government says.
Security forces have been out in strength in Sindh province
The election is meant to pave the way for a return to democratic rule, suspended in October 1999 when the then Gen Musharraf seized power through a coup.
Mohammedmian Soomro, the caretaker prime minister, said the government would consult other political parties on the election issue.
Ms Bhutto's political rival Nawaz Sharif, who was deposed as prime minister in the coup, has announced his party will now boycott the election, saying free elections were impossible under Mr Musharraf.
Another opposition politician, the former cricketer Imran Khan, joined Mr Sharif's call for Mr Musharraf's resignation, blaming the president for failing to provide adequate security for Ms Bhutto.

With all the opposition parties now against the election, it is hard to see how they will be a true test of the democratic process, the BBC's Karishma Vaswani reports. �
Ms Bhutto, 54, was leaving the election rally in Rawalpindi, standing in the open sunroof of a car, when the attack happened.
Seconds later, the attacker blew himself up, killing at least 20 other people.
Ms Bhutto returned from eight years of self-imposed exile in October, following an amnesty agreed with President Musharraf.

Shortly after her return, she survived a double bomb attack on her convoy in Karachi which killed more than 130 people. She accused rogue elements of the intelligence services of involvement in the attack.
The al-Qaeda commander in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, claimed responsibility for her assassination, according to the Asia Times newspaper.

'Cramped life' for Bangladeshis
Bangladeshis lacking privacy and dignity, says the report
Bangladeshis in London are 40 times more likely to live in cramped and poor housing than anyone else in the UK, according to a study.
A fifth of Bangladeshis live in overcrowded conditions, the Policy Studies Institute found.
Tower Hamlets: Fear of racism deepens the problemFamilies have twice as many people per room as white households and 43% live in homes with insufficient bedroom space - compared with a national average of 3%.
The report called for a programme to overhaul public housing, especially in the London borough of Tower Hamlets, where the bulk of the UK Bangladeshi population lives. Study author Elaine Kempson said: "The heart of the problem lies in the trend in Britain towards a greater number of smaller households as young people leave home at an earlier age and larger numbers of marriages break down.
"As a consequence, Bangladeshi communities, where the extended family remains strong, find that their needs for larger homes cannot be met.
"The consequences are serious and wide-ranging."
Insanitary conditions
The report found that the results of overcrowding resulted in a widespread lack of privacy and dignity.
In particular bedrooms have to be shared, and bathroom facilities are often inadequate, it said.
In Tower Hamlets, where 36,955 Bangladeshis were recorded in the 1991 census, housing officers have found fear of racism has made the problem worse.
The desire to remain within a tight community is putting Bangladeshis off moving to areas where larger properties are available.
Better management of public housing - and improved designs - would help alleviate the problem, the Policy Studies Institute said.
Its report comes a day after Britain's Eastern Eye newspaper said Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are among Britain's poorest Asians.
They are worse off, as a whole, than pensioners and are more likely to live in run-down, crime-ridden neighbourhoods, it said.
