NZ judge orders 'odd' name change
A judge in New Zealand made a young girl a ward of court so that she could change the name she hated - Talula Does The Hula From Hawaii. Judge Rob Murfitt said that the name embarrassed the nine-year-old and could expose her to teasing. He attacked a trend of giving children bizarre names, citing several examples.
Officials had blocked Sex Fruit, Keenan Got Lucy and Yeah Detroit, he said, but Number 16 Bus Shelter, Violence and Midnight Chardonnay had been allowed.
One mother wanted to name her child O.crnia using text language, but was later persuaded to use Oceania, he said. 'Social handicap'
The ruling, in the city of New Plymouth on the North Island, was handed down in February but only made public now. UNUSUAL NAMES
Allowed: Violence; Number 16 Bus Shelter; Midnight Chardonnay; Benson and Hedges (twins)
Blocked: Yeah Detroit; Stallion; Twisty Poi; Keenan Got Lucy; Sex Fruit; Fat Boy; Cinderella Beauty Blossom; Fish and Chips (twins) The name issue emerged during a custody hearing for the young girl - who had refused to tell her friends her name and went simply by "K". "The court is profoundly concerned about the very poor judgment which this child's parents have shown in choosing this name," Judge Murfitt wrote. "It makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap, unnecessarily."
Talula Does The Hula From Hawaii's name has now been changed and the custody case resolved, court officials said. New Zealand does not allow names that would cause offence or that are longer than 100 characters, Registrar-General Brian Clarke said. Officials often tried to talk parents out of particularly unusual choices that could embarrass their offspring, the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying.
You've been telling us about your unusual names. Below are a selection of your comments: My unusual name hasn't affected me at all; in fact, it has helped me make friends and improve my confidence, especially since leaving school.Russell Sprout, London, UK
I often get jokes about my names as I am named after the Western Isle that my family originally come from. Although I am proud of the name, shortening to Eris, as I normally do gets some strange looks.Eriskay Toreen, England
What kind of parents would name their child after a bus shelter? I could only understand it if they had been trying for a baby for years without success and then, out of the blue, octuplets came along.
And as for the twins called Benson & Hedges, does that mean they not allowed in any enclosed public space?Jonathan, Leicester
My name is Chris Morley. It's just about the most common name in Britain and I've got no problem with it whatsoever. In fact I like it. Who do these people think they are, afflicting other human beings with ridiculous names that are almost certainly going to open them up to ridicule and, at worst, bullying? True parents, loving parents, try to give their offspring the best start in life. Instead these selfish idiots - who either find such names funny or who are so desperate to gain attention that they are willing to use their children as a tool - are socially handicapping their children from the very moment of birth. Talula Does The Hula From Hawaii is utterly ridiculous and insulting, and I am both happy with, and unsurprised by, the judges decision. I hope her 'parents' are ashamed.Chris Morley, Oxford, UK
I hated my parents for what they named me up until I was a teenager, but then I just became comfortable with it. I suppose it was just bad for me as my sister was called Judy.Ftango Molasses, London England
Funny the number of people who when hearing my name for the first time still think they're the first to come up with the 'how's Liz'gag! Been happening for best part of 50 years now!!Richard Burton, London
Shanmuga Velu Palani Velu, My father name is Chinnaswamy Palani Velu. My father kept my name as Shanmuga Velu. Now because of that my full name is Shanmuga Velu Palani Velu. Many of my friends known me as Velu, becasue of the lengthy unusual name.Shanmuga I have been teased mercilessly from childhood to my adult years...you won't believe the amount of times people have burst out laughing right in my face when they ask my name..Craig Gogay, London, UK
My name is relatively unusual but it has not caused me any problems in life - apart from the frustration caused by the constant mis-spelling of Laslo. I have been called "Lasio", "Lazlo" and one time "Lazio".Laslo Panaflex, Belgium
I have had my future kids names picked out for the last 5 years: Spoon Marie, Toaster Thadious, and Grayson Basin Mason...maybe I should have 4 now that Tullulah Does The Hula From Hawaii has become free!Cassie, Cardiff
We have three children two girls named Storm and Skye and a boy named Blade ... if we have another boy, his name will be Raven, River or Rayne.TJ, Hampshire, UK
I have recently changed my name from Bruce, James, Spencer Robinson to Jackson, James Robinson. I got bullied at school for being called Bruce, at the time Mr Forsyth was on the TV a lot and kids don't need much to tease and bully. My Family and work friends have adjusted quickly to the change.Jackson Robinson, Exeter UK
My full name is: Elisabeth, Anne, Helene, Catherine, Genevieve, Cecile, Marguerite, Marie Szentkereszty de Zagon (Baroness). My passport and ID only have my initials on them. My driver's licence (American) did not have room enough for the entire last name. My names are common (except last name and means Holy Cross of Zagon - which is in Transylvania) I do love my name, but usually only use Elisabeth de Zagon... Elisabeth, Brussels, Belgium
My grandmother was perhaps a bit ahead of her time in 1927 in naming her first child, my father, after a popular recording star of the time. She was a fan of Ivor Norvello, but obviously didn't link the first name Ivor, with her surname Payne before the birth was registered. My father was therefore christened Ivor Payne. He said that he really was the forerunner of the unfortunately named hero of the Jonny Cash song, A Boy named Sue, in that there weren't too many days at school when he wasn't involved in a fight because someone had teased him about his name. Sadly he died in 1999, and one of the questions I never asked him was whether he felt having that particular name had affected his life. Ivor Payne 1927 1999 R.I.P. Martin Payne, Norwich, Norfolk I changed my name by deed poll to Jenna Dana Bananarama Rater. I'm now the Jenna Rater!Jenna Dana Bananarama Rater, Cardiff, Wales
I fell into this trap completely by accident with my son Connor. It was only when his first piece of post arrived that we realised he was C. Shaw.Phil Shaw, Portsmouth
Although my name is becoming more common when I was young I was often teased because of my unusual name that was when people actually got it right. The usual comment was "where's hardy then?" but i think the best one was when I was seven my teacher had had enough of having to correct herself when she called me laura, lauren, laurence and so decided that she was going to call me Daisy as it was simpler! Thankfully now I love my name as it is uncommon but I really think parents should think about how their children will be treated rather than jumping onboard the weird name band wagonLaurel, Swansea
My name has been a source of angst my entire life. To this day I have to repeat ad nauseum;often times spelling my name, in a futile effort to have it pronounced correctly. Sadly my middle name is no better and I was left with no choices in school. I was bullied, ridiculed and mocked and to this day supposedly mature adults still have a snicker at my expense. I approve whole heartedly of the New Zealand law that offers some recourse to children so benighted. Naming your child is not an exercise in creative writing or an avenue for personal expression; if you want that take a class or write a book. The psychological effects of an odd name are painful, deep and lasting. Kurleigh Martin, San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago
My sister (Che) and I both have unusual names and we love them! It's nice to be unique in your school/college or place of work. It can also be an ice-breaker when meeting new people. Lots of people comment favourably about my name and I've never been bullied as a consequence of it. Chula Bishop, Newbury England
Its easy to see the embarrassment at an early age but as soon as she is old enough she will recall the tale fondly with people saying 'did your parents really call you that?'. I'd look back and wish I kept it, but then I like my credit cards reading 'Mr D Vine'.Darren Vine, Warwick
Being called Slick has its advantages and disadvantages but I get along just fine, in fact I've learned to love my name.Slick Bryn Davies, Manchester
No-one ever considered that the child might like the quirkiness of their name. Nothing has ever held back my development or progress in the world. I'm now working in the catering trade and everyone calls me Eggy. I don't see the problem!Egnorwiddle Waldstrom , London, UK
My name is Varithamby Jeyahprakash Tharamakulaseelarajan my brother's name is Sathiyasothilegaeswaran Thramakulaseelerajan, we still struggle to fill-in legal forms because they never have enough space. Parents do not think long term when naming their children specially in South Asia. I think they should be given lessons in naming their offsprings.J Rajan, Colombo Sri Lanka
My friends call me Manny!Mangled Brown Fence-Post, London
I went to school with a boy called Justin Kayce.Chris Morton, Plymouth, UK

Corporate woes hit Wall Street
It has been another tough day for US investors
Shares in New York have taken another battering after worries about US company profits resurfaced.
The Dow Jones share index closed down 295.67 points at 7,701.45 - a fall of 3.7%.
The mood failed to be lifted by official figures which showed that the US economy grew faster than previously thought in the April to June period.
Earlier in Europe the FTSE 100 index closed up 1.5% in London, the Dax fell 3.4% in Frankfurt while in Paris the Cac 40 edged 0.4% lower.
Profits under pressure
On Thursday the Dow Jones had climbed nearly 2% on hopes that the US economy was set to avoid a double-dip recession.
But a wave of bad news from major US companies saw all Thursday's gains reversed.
General Electric saw its share price fall by more than 7% to $24.47 after Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston both cut their ratings on the company.
Shares in cigarette maker Philip Morris dropped by 11% after the company cut its profits forecast for 2002 late on Thursday.
Drug maker Wyeth saw its shares plummet nearly 20% to $31.10 after it warned that full-year earnings would be lower than expected.
And shares in Delta Air Lines descended 24% to $8.69 after the airline said losses would be bigger than expected in the third quarter, and announced plans to cut 1,500 jobs.
"We still have earnings problems, economic growth problems and international problems -- and until those get straightened out the market is not going to do anything," said James Volk,
managing director of equity trading at D.A. Davidson and Co.
Growth revised upwards
The bad corporate news overshadowed official figures released earlier in the day which showed that the US economy grew faster than previously thought during the second quarter.
GDP, the widest measure of economic output, grew by an annual rate of 1.3% during the three months, a rise on the previous estimate of 1.1%.
The upward revision to the GDP figures was down to higher exports than previously calculated.
While the upward adjustment was welcomed, it still marked a big slowdown from the first three months of the year, when the US economy grew at an annual rate of 5%.
Separate data from the University of Michigan showed its final consumer sentiment index for September falling to 86.1 from 87.6 in August.
Despite the drop the figure was slightly better than expected.

Actor Willis' $1m Saddam bounty
Willis said he thought Iraqis welcomed US troops
Actor Bruce Willis has performed before US soldiers in Telafar, northern Iraq, and offered $1m (�603,000) to the man who captures Saddam Hussein.
"We're here to support you," the star told troops as he sang a set of blues songs with his band, the Accelerator.
"If you catch him, just give me four seconds with Saddam Hussein," he said.
Willis will next fly south to visit US soldiers in Tikrit - Saddam's home town - before performing two concerts for troops in neighbouring Kuwait. "Somebody that supports the military like he has and that comes to visit soldiers - that's important to us," said Greg Pagan, from 3rd Brigade of the 101st's Airborne Division based at Telafar.
'Thumbs up'
"It's awesome," said commander Col Michael Linnington. "It's great for morale. "He's a macho actor. Soldiers identify with action movies and action actors. He's a guy's guy."
During an interview Willis said: "Peculiar thing back home is that the liberal media was trying to portray it as a bad war.
"But being over here just a couple of days, seeing how well our troops and the allied troops are being received here, (I) think the Iraqi people are happy we're here," the Hollywood star said.
Willis will also visit troops in Kuwait
"Children are being taken care of, starting being inoculated, starting being looked after. Wherever these guys go they get thumbs up. They no longer have to contend with the terrorist leader," Willis said.
But the star later admitted he had not met many Iraqis because he had been travelling the country by helicopter.
Willis, a Republican party supporter, was one of the few celebrities to publicly back the US' stance during the recent war on Iraq, which was led by President Bush.
Willis recently played a US special forces commander sent in to rescue medical staff in war-torn Nigeria in the film Tears of the Sun.

Digging into naval hero's history
A dig has started around the cottage birthplace of Jones
An archaeological dig has started in Dumfries and Galloway in an attempt to find out more about the Scot viewed as the founder of the United States Navy.
A US team is carrying out the investigation at the cottage where John Paul Jones was born in 1747.
They hope even traces of "trash" will shed more light on his early years.
Doctors Julie Schablinsky and Bob Neyland are leading the dig, which has been funded by the First Landing Foundation project of Virginia City.
Dr Schablinksy said she believed there was a good chance that interesting artefacts could be found at Arbigland near Kirkbean.
I think any sort of find that would include a feature like a concentration of artefacts or even old outbuildings would really add to our knowledge about how John Paul lived
Dr Julie Schablinsky
"I think there is a lot of potential to find something here," she said.
"Although the cottage has been modified over time and there has been some utility work there are a lot of areas that could still hold intact deposits from the time period of John Paul Jones.
"We would expect to find in both the back yard and the side yard places where they threw away their trash which is really what archaeologists try to find to reconstruct how people lived hundreds and hundreds of years ago."
The dig has been supported by the First Landing Foundation - a group dedicated to exploring the history of the Virginia area.
Dr Schablinsky added that any information could be vital in piecing together the story of the Solway-born sailor.
"I think any sort of find that would include a feature like a concentration of artefacts or even old outbuildings would really add to our knowledge about how John Paul lived," she said.
Famous battle
Jones made his first voyage to America as a ship's apprentice at the age of 13.
He took his first command at 21 and at 29 he joined the fledgling American, or Continental, Navy. In 1779 he fought his most famous battle against the British Navy when at the helm of the Bonhomme Richard he engaged the frigate Serapis off Flamborough Head on the Yorkshire coast.
Apparently losing the battle, Jones and his men boarded the British frigate and captured it.
Jones died in France in 1792 but in 1905 the US brought his remains back for burial in the crypt of the naval academy chapel. E-mail this to a friend

Workers win pension compensation
The Cosi factory is now under new ownership
Cosmetics workers who lost at least half their savings in a company pension scheme are among the first in the UK to become eligible for compensation. Up to 200 staff at the former Creative Outsourcing Solutions International (Cosi) plant at Maesteg are involved.
It follows the UK government's decision to extend pension compensation to workers where the schemes were wound up and the firm remained in business.
The GMB union has welcomed the decision to compensate those who lost out.
The company scheme was wound up around eight years ago when the factory, which now has new owners, was run by Cosi. The UK Government said the workers would have lost at least half of their savings.
Some of them will find that the small pittance they might have got will now turn into a reasonable pension.
UK Minister Mike O'Brien
Last year, the decision was taken to give 90% compensation to workers who lost their pensions when their employers went bust and that has now been extended to those who worked for firms who wound up schemes but remained in business. Around 10,000 people across the UK could be affected by the ruling.
Minister for Pensions Reform Mike O'Brien said for most of those workers "this is going to be a very big relief indeed". "Many of them have been very worried about their pensions. You know, the government wanted to do justice by them so they're now going to be given broadly the same sort of coverage as if they has gone into difficulties after 2004. "They'll get the same sort of package of help. And it'll mean that some of them who were planning to retire early will now be able to retire early rather than not being able to do so which might have been the case. Walk away
"Some of them will find that the small pittance they might have got will now turn into a reasonable pension.
The exact compensation figures have yet to be worked. The GMB union says up to 200 people may have been affected. So far only a small number of the workers have felt the loss because most are still in work. Former government pensions adviser Ros Alltman, a leading campaigner for pension reform, believes these people suffered just as much as the former ASW steel workers who have campaigned hard for compensation after the firm went bust
Until 2003, she said it was just too easy for companies to simply wind up their schemes and leave workers out of pocket.
She said: "The law allowed them to just walk away from their pension scheme without having put in enough money to pay the pensions
All along the government had told the members of the scheme that the law protected them which of course it didn't."

Second bite for BBC's Being Human
Being Human stars Russell Tovey, Lenora Crichlow and Aidan Turner
Bristol-based drama, Being Human, has been re-commissioned by BBC Three for another eight-part series.
It chronicles the lives of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost, and has been a hit with critics and audiences alike.
The show's first series, broadcast in early 2009, attracted audiences of more than one million, and was one of the BBC's best-performing websites.
Being Human was shot on location in and around Bristol, including Totterdown and Bristol General Hospital.
Danny Cohen, controller BBC Three, says: "It's hugely popular with young viewers and earned great critical acclaim at the same time.
"It's also a very important staging-post in the successful development of home-grown young drama on BBC Three."
You can find out more about Bring Human, including cast biographies and exclusive behind the scenes video, on the show's official BBC website.

By Ibrahim Sannie
BBC Sport
Laryea Kingston is on the hunt for a new club
Ghana midfielder Laryea Kingston has been released by Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem after just six months at the club.The 30-year-old joined the club at the start of the season on a free transfer. He signed a one-year contract in August but has been released after failing to impress. "Vitesse Arnhem technical team has decided to allow Laryea Kingston to leave the club earlier than expected," a club statement read. Kingston was unable to command a starting place at Vitesse since joining the Eredivisie side. He moved to Holland after being released by Scottish side Hearts, where he spent three seasons. The Ghana international has arrived home to contemplate his next club move.

Chelsea's shopping list
Chelsea's summer spending topped �74m with the signing of Romanian striker Adrian Mutu from Parma.
Having already snapped up Juan Sebastian Veron from Manchester United for �15m and Joe Cole from West Ham for �6.6m, Blues boss Claudio Ranieri shelled out another �15.8m on Mutu.
Earlier in the summer, Damien Duff joined for �17m from Blackburn and Chelsea also captured Glen Johnson, Geremi and Wayne Bridge.

Parker commits to Charlton Scott Parker - Charlton's 22-year-old was linked with several clubs - but has committed himself to the Addicks by penning a five-year deal. Jermaine Jenas - The 20-year-old was reportedly recommended to Chelsea by England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson - but Chelsea appeared not to follow up the recommendation.
Robson denies Dyer link Kieron Dyer - The former Ipswich midfielder was apparently recommended along with Newcastle team-mate Jenas and though Newcastle were said to be willing to allow him to leave for �25m, a deal never materialised.
Chelsea fail with Emerson bid
Emerson - The Blues made the Brazil skipper a prime target for a central midfield role. A bid of �17.5m was rejected by AS Roma.
Claude Makelele - The Real Madrid midfielder is a key man at the Bernabeu, but is thought to be on wages of 'only' �20,000-a-week. Chelsea were said to be prepared to double that to bring him to Stamford Bridge.
Van Bommel makes Chelsea claim
Mark van Bommel - The PSV Eindhoven captain claims Chelsea made a move to sign him from the Dutch side - but the signings of Joe Cole and Juan Sebastien Veron appeared to rule him out of a move.

Thierry Henry - He is happy at Arsenal and has recently penned a new deal - but Chelsea were rumoured to have made a �50m bid for the French international.
Ronaldinho - SIGNED FOR BARCELONA.
Ronaldinho signs for Barca
Wayne Rooney - This was as unlikely as much as it was ambitious. The Everton wonder kid has emerged as a potential saviour of the Goodison Park side and they are determined to hold onto their prized asset.
Fernando Torres - The Spanish Under-21 is one of the country's hottest young prospects and Chelsea were believed to have made his club, Atletico Madrid, a �28m offer for the 19-year-old.
Chelsea fail with Raul bid
Raul - The Real Madrid striker's agent claimed Chelsea made a world-record �71.4m bid for the Spanish striker, but Raul immediately rejected it.
