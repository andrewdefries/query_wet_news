Jimmy Fallon is a busy guy, and with a show of his own to run, he doesn't always have the time to sit down and watch what everyone else is up to.
So to stay on top of the news, he asked his staff to mash up clips from the other NBC shows to help him get the gist of what's going on in the world.
It's a new segment he's calling "Said It and Re-Edit," and we've got to say, we prefer the news this way.

#OccupyWallStreet has been drawing complaints that it doesn't have a demand and a goal. But I say that is precisely its significance. #OccupyWallStreet is a hashtag revolt. As I learned with my own little #FuckYouWashington uprising, a hashtag has no owner, no heirarchy, no canon or credo. It is a blank slate onto which anyone may impose his or her frustrations, complaints, demands, wishes, or principles. So I will impose mine. #OccupyWallStreet, to me, is about institutional failure. And so it is appropriate that #OccupyWallStreet itself is not run as an institution. We don't trust institutions anymore. Name a bank or financial institution you can trust today. That industry was built entirely on trust -- we entrusted our money to their cloud -- and they failed us. Government? The other day, I heard a cabinet member from a prior administration call Washington "paralyzed and poisonous" -- and he's an insider. Media? Pew released a study last week saying that three-quarters of Americans don't believe journalists get their facts straight (which is their only job). Education? Built for a prior, institutional era. Religion? Various of its outlets are abusing children or espousing bigotry or encouraging violence. The #OccupyWallStreet troops are demonizing practically all of corporate America and with it, capitalism. What institutions are left? I can't name one. In a Foreign Affairs essay in 2008, Richard Haass argued that the world is moving from bi- and unipolarity (that is, the Cold War and its aftermath) to nonpolarity (i.e., no one's in charge). "We now operate in an open marketplace of influence," I wrote in my last book. "One need no longer control institutions to control agendas." Now one needs a network. #OccupyWallStreet is that network, the headless tail. Even it's not sure what it is. Indeed, I think it would have been better off not issuing a manifesto written by a committee of the whole park, going after even animal rights and ending with its own Ninth Amendment: "*These grievances are not all-inclusive." Henry Blodget mocks many of their demands. Feminisnt says they aren't specific enough. They can't win. But I think they are already winning. #OccupyWallStreet is a start and it is growing, as Micah Sifry wrote: "There's something happening here, Mr. Jones." What's happening is an attempt to define a new public, now that we can. Iceland, Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya are all countries being reimagined and remade: start-up nations. Hear Icelandic MP Birgitta Jonsdottir talk about building a new constitution, using Facebook, on the principles of "equality, transparency, accountability, and honesty" -- liberté, égalité, fraternité, updated for the networked age. In the end, this is why I wrote Public Parts, because we have the tools and thus the opportunity to rethink and reorganize our publics and decide what they stand for. The power and freedom that Gutenberg's press brought to the early modern era, our networked tools now bring everyone in this, the early digital age. "They empower us. They grant us the ability to create, to connect, to organize, and to aggregate our knowledge.... They lower borders, even challenging our notion of nations." That's what the youth of these countries are doing. Media have mocked the denizens of #OccupyWallStreet as scruffy, young hippies. But you should have seen me -- and more of media's bosses than you can imagine -- in '68. Scruffy, simplistic, bombastic, angry, determined, self-righteous, right, and high -- that was us. Media dismissed us just as they dismiss the denizens of Zuccotti Park. Authorities thought they could round up all the '68ers in Grant Park, just as they do now on the Brooklyn Bridge. When I visited #OccupyWallStreet's park Friday, I wore a sport coat. I had to because earlier that day, I had a meeting at a place where they wear them. But I'm glad I brought it, for it's time to show that #OccupyWallStreet represents more than scruffy young leftists. I don't say that for a moment to denigrate them and their spirit. They built #OccupyWallStreet. No, I say it's time for more of us to follow their leadership and join them, to show that what they represent -- the anger, the determination, and the inherent hope -- speaks for more of us, even people in suits. What #OccupyWallStreet has done with considerable success -- as the best hashtags and publics do -- is open a conversation, one we must have, about the shape of our nation and society and future. If you don't like their manifesto and demands, fine: What are yours? At the end of Public Parts, I present mine, knowing they aren't the right ones but urging people to enter a conversation not about complaints or demands but instead about the principles of our new and open society. I don't think #OccupyWallStreet is or should be about just venting anger or demonizing business or complaining or demanding. Indeed, of whom are we making these demands? The failed institutions? The ones our networks will disrupt if not displace? I say the message of #OccupyWallStreet should be more hopeful than that: building a new and open public based on the principles of a society that will replace the dying institutions and their ways.

Kelly Cogswell: So You Want to Be an Activist?
I want the Occupy Wall Street protestors to be better, smarter, more focused than they are. I also want them to succeed as street activists. The problem is that organizing demos, not to mention movements, is more complicated than it looks. Chris Weigant: Wall Street Protest, Circa 1967
Abbie Hoffman's merry band of pranksters took a tour of the NYSE on August 24, 1967. The tour ended at a gallery overlooking the trading floor. Hoffman and his friends rushed to the railing, and began throwing money onto the heads of the traders below.	Marty Kaplan: Occupy K Street
Without campaign finance reform, the future belongs to the big dogs in the money game. I wish Occupy Wall Street would connect the dots between whatever their issues are and the mother of all issues. Dan Agin: Occupy Wall Street: A Bloomberg-Kelly Musical
The musical Occupy Wall Street will open soon on Broadway. But for those Have-Nots who can't afford tickets, here's a peek at rehearsals.	Josh Silver: Wall Street Protests: A Right-Left Movement Must Emerge
Americans from the right and left must abandon the polarizing rhetoric from our leaders and our TV screens, and join hands in support of a 21st century democracy reform agenda that reclaims our government from moneyed special interests.	Raymond Heard: "Who Gassed You Today, Dad?" One Man's Memory of Street Protests
The essential difference between Occupy Wall Street and street protests a generation ago is that the latter were for human rights and peace, whereas the motive of the former is mainly economic. Given that history can repeat itself as farce and tragedy, here are some recollections of the high points of the American protests.	Wendi L. Adamek: Flashmob Meditators Occupy Wall Street
The meditators were no doubt derided as hopelessly naive by Wall Street Olympians. Absorbed by the lightning-fast cyberspace synapses of the global economic body, why would they even bother to look? Tom Hayden: Let Wall Street Beware a Risen People
No one can know where the wind will blow. The protests which are spreading are so far thin in numbers, organization and outreach. But sometimes the wind blows sparks.	Sheldon Filger: "Occupy Wall Street" and Mass Arrests in New York City: Is This the Start of a Revolution?
It is too early to determine the future course of this movement, and whether or not it is a flash in the pan or a self-sustaining phenomenon that could lead to a full-scale national, revolutionary mass protest movement.	Most Popular

In case you didn't catch it, the World Bank's top official for Africa just thumbed her nose at the dozens of renewable energy companies lining up to build clean energy in Africa's dirtiest economy. Obiageli Ezekwesili, the Bank's Vice President for Africa, defended a controversial $3.75-billion loan to build a massive coal plant in South Africa with this head-in-the-sand statement: "There is no viable alternative to safeguard South Africa's energy security at this particular time." The quote came in an article titled (without irony) "Africa Ready for Energy Transformation." With that kind of transformation, the continent can look forward to many more decades of playing catch-up with the rest of the world. Maybe Ms. Ezekwesili missed the news that South Africa could get 10-20% of its electricity from wind power in the short term (and up to 70% over time), by harvesting some of its 50,000 MW of potential (it currently has just one 5MW commercial wind farm in place). Or that the sunny nation also has huge potential for solar (one study shows 547 gigawatts in potential for grid-based concentrating solar plants, not to mention equally impressive potential for solar water heating and solar PV). Writes a local columnist, "Research shows that in conjunction with energy efficiency measures, 75% our electricity could be generated by exploiting renewable energy sources by 2050, slashing our CO2 emissions by 54% below 1990 levels and making massive strides towards avoiding catastrophic climate change." But the national utility, Eskom, has been despairingly slow to move away from coal to embrace a green energy future. Says South African professor Patrick Bond: "South Africa's five-fold increase in CO2 emissions since 1950 and 20% increase during the 1990s, can largely be blamed upon the attempt by state electricity company Eskom, the mining houses (led by Anglo American) and huge metals smelters (especially BHP Billiton) to brag of the world's cheapest electricity. Emitting 20 times the carbon tonnage per unit of economic output per person than even the United States, South African capital's reliance upon fossil fuels is scandalous." Says extractive-industries activist Bobby Peek, of the South African group groundWork: "The South African government cannot continue to give away electricity below cost, to fire smelters which have little linkage to the South African economy. If the World Bank loan goes through, poor South Africans will have to bear the burden of Eskom's debt, and climate change will intensify." It's not just activists who are up in arms: the Cape Town Chamber of Commerce is calling for a national investigation into Eskom's "sweetheart deals" for big industrial energy users at the expense of everyone else. Unions, too, have recently joined a coalition calling on the World Bank to drop the project.
The World Bank, whose job is to fund poverty alleviation, not cheap power for aluminum smelters, talks of Africa's energy sector "transforming" itself the way the telecoms industry did - a truly transformative sector-wide change that brought affordable mobile phone service across the continent. But the energy sector cannot transform itself if it looks only to megaprojects for salvation. The telecoms industry was a bottom-up transformation, one that bypassed big bureaucracies to create decentralized service one could buy in small packages, as needed. As long as Eskom and other African utilities are focusing more on mega-industries' needs, and giving them subsidized rates to keep them happy, there will be no transformation, nor a significant change in the ranks of the unconnected. Africa definitely needs an energy revolution, but it needs to focus on people power first.
Meanwhile, renewable energy developers are waiting in the wings for Eskom to show them the money in the form of power purchase agreements. Wind power developer Eddie O'Connor told Engineering News that South Africa was "pregnant with potential". I guess the World Bank won't be the one to deliver that baby.

As Terry Jones and his Quran-burning stunt grow smaller in the rear-view mirror of history, it is time to take the opportunity to acknowledge the good thing that we as a nation accomplished in reacting to Jones' threat. In fact, if not for the damage that he has done by endangering American people and interests abroad, the event might be viewed as a positive indicator of the health of our country. The episode marks an important and rare moment of national agreement on two fundamental American principles. The first piece of good news is that there was not one person of any substance who supported Jones' effort -- not one. From the range of political affiliations to every religious community, even the atheists -- nobody supported this guy. In this fractured American political environment, we had a national consensus that there were limits to offensive behavior and Islam-baiting. We decided that burning books of any kind, and especially a holy book, was an un-American activity. And with one voice we condemned it.
My guess is that Jones was surprised by this. Jones probably thought that he would be embraced as a hero by Christians who wanted to "stand up against Islam," but not one person supported him. Sarah Palin told him to sit down and shut up, articulating what all Americans were thinking. In the end, it may have been the unanimous lack of support that finally convinced Jones that he was wrong. We must not turn the page on this episode without underlining, for ourselves and for the world, that this proposed act was universally condemned by the American public. If we fail to shout that from the mountain tops, then we are missing an important opportunity to clarify the nature of America to people around the world, especially Muslims, as well missing a chance to affirm something good that we accomplished together as one nation. The second piece of good news coming out of Jones' debacle is that it tested our commitment to freedom of speech -- and we passed. While it is frustrating and dangerous, freedom of speech is a constitutional right in America. I never heard anyone saying that Jones couldn't burn a Quran, just that he shouldn't. He was not jailed for what he was proposing, even though expediency might have supported such an action. It is in moments of heightened anxiety that a society is most likely to think that it can meddle with basic rights in the name of security. But it is exactly during those moments when we must be most vigilant. And we were. This dedication to freedom, even when that freedom is crazy and offensive, is hard for other nations to understand. But if we are really going to be a beacon of democracy -- a government for the people, by the people -- we have to show the world that freedom of speech is fundamental and that we will not waver from our foundations. A great deal of damage has been done by Jones, and the narrative that the entire affair was embarrassing for the media and a failure for our country has become common. Yet our reaction, which combined interreligious solidarity and decency with a commitment to the constitutional right of freedom of speech, made me proud to be an American. This Blogger's Books from

Every religious scripture has questionable ideas. To say the Quran promotes terrorism because of violent passages is as wrong as saying the Jewish and Christian faiths are evil because the way God is portrayed sometimes gets a little nasty.

Eid, the holiday marking the end of Ramadan, is a joyous time. This Ramadan, by contrast, has felt heavy. Cathleen Falsani: Church of the Holy Hand Grenade

I abhor your actions and, as a devout follower of Jesus Christ, I am embarrassed and ashamed that you would tarnish the Christian family with actions contrary to Jesus' spirit and teachings.	Jon M. Sweeney: How to Properly Dispose of Unwanted Holy Books
An unwanted holy book, be it Jewish, Christian, Muslim, or any other scripture, can be disposed of humanely and appropriately, but not burned. You never, ever burn them. Dr. David Liepert: Muslims, the Quran and the Importance of Understanding Symbols of Faith
I think one of the main problems with the current state of Muslim/American relations is that nobody gets the other side's symbols and when meanings misalign, messages misfire.	Rev. Meg Riley: Teaching Fear, Teaching Faith
There have to be some religious people who understand that what is holy, which some call God, is big enough to hold Allah and Jesus, Muhammad and Moses, Vishnu and Buddha.	Around the Web:
