This is the first in an occasional series, Strange Bedfellows, in which we highlight unexpected collaborations between artists.
From their first foray into the music scene 10 years ago, the Interpol outfit has framed their identity with a simple, bold color scheme -- red, black and white. It was the heart of their band logo, front-and-center on the cover of their debut album, Turn on the Bright Lights, and even followed them on stage.
So it was fitting, or as Interpol guitarist Daniel Kessler put it, a "happy accident," when David Lynch made use of this same scheme in his short animated film, "I Touch a Red Button Man," to accompany the song "Lights" off the group's latest, self-titled album. The short film collaboration first played at the band's live show at Coachella this year, and is making its web premiere on The Huffington Post.
But first, let's backtrack. How did Lynch's and Interpol's worlds -- and colors -- even collide? The seeds of this collaboration were first planted back in 2008: Interpol had been mulling over collaborating with someone in the realm of cinema for a while, and Lynch was at the top of all of their lists.
"We're all big fans of David -- it's a common point, one of those things that's unanimous," Kessler said over the phone from Italy.
They had a casual meeting with the filmmaker, which Interpol describes (in their own words here) as more of an "icebreaker," with "no real agenda."
Fast-forward to 2010, and the band was thinking ahead to how they could incorporate visual elements into their live Coachella performance in April 2011. A typical Interpol live experience involves a light show, but this time they were looking for something a little different. Naturally, Lynch came to mind.
"We'd never done anything like that before, and he'd never done anything like that before, either," Kessler said. "The question was finding the right timing to have the opportunity to work on something together, and I think it felt right to him."
Trusting in his vision, Interpol was happy to hand over all creative license for the song's visuals to Lynch, which at this point consisted of no more than a sketch of a curious-looking "red button man." "We wanted to do our half and provide the music and the second half would be...you know, visual autonomy by David Lynch," Kessler explained.
Lynch illustrated the film almost entirely in black and white, with flashes of color appearing when the red button man mechanically presses -- you guessed it -- a red button. The color red grows more present as the video progresses and eventually overwhelms the screen.
Intentionally or not, the colors in "I Touch a Red Button Man" match Interpol's signature color scheme and the lighting treatment Interpol typically uses to perform the song "Lights" during live shows -- a flashing red sequence that grows progressively more intense, as seen here:
"It's a slow-building red light scheme that builds and builds as the song builds and builds and becomes more dynamic," Kessler explained. "The song, and the possibility of fitting that animated figure, kind of worked, and I think he was enthused by that prospect, and he went away at it."
The final version of the film moves like clockwork with "Lights" from beginning to end, as the red button man moves in sync with the beat, and occasionally goes berserk when the song does. At times, even the images and lyrics seem to match up -- for example, the film jerks away from the red button man's eyes as Interpol's lead singer Paul Banks sings, "peaceful eyes drawn away from me." (Though the red button man's eyes, it should be noted, are anything but peaceful.) "I was kind of blown away by just seeing it," Kessler said. "I think originally it was going to be something a bit more succinct -- I don't think it was going to go for the duration of the song, but I think he kind of found a way to make it work."
But who is this red button man anyway, and how did he enter Lynch's psyche?
"I think it's supposed to be left a mystery," Kessler said. "Just like we took it as such when he described the idea to us."
So does Lynch. The filmmaker chose not to answer questions, opting to have the animation stand on its own. He didn't let the band in on much, either, but Interpol wasn't fazed by this crypticness -- perhaps because the band isn't any more revelatory about their half of the work than their collaborator is.
"People listen to songs, you know, and try to piece things together," Kessler explained. "We'd rather not spell it out for them, so people don't listen to the song and try to figure out where it matches what we were saying."
With both sides composed of such like minds, what we can surmise here is that this collaboration was likely a smooth one -- each side does their own thing, no questions asked. So here you have the web premiere of the Lynch/Interpol collaboration, "I Touch a Red Button Man." Decide for yourself what's going on: FOLLOW HUFFPOST CULTURE

Two major Wall Street firms say their executives will face the same repercussions for misconduct as everybody else at the company -- but it's not clear how often those consequences are actually enforced.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have both recently confirmed that their clawback policies -- the rules stipulating that an employee who takes risks that damage the company will have to give back some portion of their pay -- apply to senior members and executives in addition to workers further down the company ladder, according to The Wall Street Journal.
But at the same time, it's "rare" in practice for a bank to actually impose clawbacks, as a lawyer quoted in the WSJ notes -- news that may come as little surprise to anyone familiar with Wall Street's record of resistance on this issue.
Last year, when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted a rule authorizing regulators to reclaim executive pay in the event of a company failure, banking groups protested, calling the move "unfair." A few months later, banks were reportedly seeking insurance policies of seven figures or more to cover salaries and bonuses threatened by clawback provisions.
In December, John Liu, city comptroller for New York, issued a call to some big banks, asking them to explicitly include executives in their clawback policies. Two of the banks Liu addressed, Goldman and Morgan Stanley, have since responded. The third, JPMorgan Chase, has not.
In general, Wall Street has been hesitent to cooperate with regulators in the years since the financial crisis, even though critics allege that a lack of oversight played a major role in the meltdown, sending the economy into a slump from which it has still not fully recovered. Regulators have tried to place special emphasis on de-incentivizing risk, something that clawbacks speak directly to, since they aim to reduce the amount bankers can earn from making dangerous trades.
At the same time, some compensation experts have argued that because bankers put up so much resistance to clawback policies -- and they're a complicated process to begin with -- it might be more effective simply to limit executive compensation in the first place instead of retroactively taking it away. Like many industries, Wall Street has a relatively poor record when it comes to treating its higher-ups the same way it treats everyone else. Junior bankers bore the brunt of many of 2011's rounds of staff cuts, and are said to be first in line for a pay freeze at some firms. Banks have also been accused of setting up lower-ranking employees to absorb regulatory consequences, as in the case of 31-year-old Fabrice Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs employee named in a major Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against that company in 2010.

There's no level playing field for criminal justice. Even the most aggressive prosecutor would readily acknowledge that, while some criminal defendants can afford a lawyer with more experience and funding, some of the weaponry in a prosecutor's immense arsenal will never, ever, be available to the defense. The defense will have no grand jury. No power to exculpate without a trial to defeat what the prosecutor did in charging a crime. No capacity to subpoena witnesses before a charge is brought. No pre-indictment ability to compel a hostile witness to appear at penalty of contempt. No power to grant immunity in order to get that testimony. No badge in his investigator's pocket to "encourage" cooperation from those with information to give. No jailhouse full of "rat" prisoners willing to give information in exchange for get-out-of-jail (or leniency) cards. Just imagine a defense lawyer telling a convict that she'll write a helpful letter to the sentencing judge or parole board if he testifies favorably for her client -- ever see that on Law & Order? No, and not in the real world either. So how does the system create a balance to ensure that prosecutors "do justice" when proof surfaces, from whatever source, that the system has miscarried -- meaning, credible evidence has emerged that a defendant has been wrongly convicted? Such balance has, indeed, been slow to come by, despite the extraordinary work of The Innocence Project and less well known institutions that advocate for convicted innocents. Importantly, looking at prosecutors around the country, even when exculpating evidence lands directly at their doorstep post-conviction, far too infrequently do they grab the bull by the horns -- there are, of course, notable exceptions -- to reexamine the facts and, where warranted, tell the court: "We screwed up -- An injustice lies here at my desk. The inmate should be fully exonerated and released immediately." It would frankly be the uncommonly, heroic prosecutor indeed who would do just that, unless the exonerating information came directly from the inmate's lawyer or the "second-look" was initiated from some compelling fact counsel disclosed to the prosecutor. Or, it arrived on the prosecutor's doorstep in circumstances where the prosecutor might reflexively want to sweep it under the rug, but would have no deniability if he did so. Unfortunately, the operative mentality too often is that since the world tends to believe that the convicted defendant is guilty anyway, why open a hornet's nest? Still, what about when the inmate or his attorney doesn't know of the evidence that exists to aid in his exoneration, and the prosecutor alone does? Shouldn't the disequilibrium actually compel the prosecutor to act proactively to make things right? Strangely, until recently, although limited case law may have seemed to require it in order to comply with due process of law, no ethics rule has directly required it. Sure, it would be the "right thing" to do -- but was it required as a matter of ethics, other than as a matter of a prosecutor's idiosyncratic ethics to help an introspectively guilt ridden prosecutor get through the dark nights of his soul? Probably not, and that's a sad thing. Imagine a court not seeing a violation in an undisclosed post-conviction receipt of exculpatory evidence, just because the defendant was already convicted when the prosecutor received the information; that would seem to fly in the face of the Brady (exculpatory evidence) rule, if not almost emasculate its logic and meaning.
Now, fortunately, the ethics rules have somewhat changed the landscape for prosecutors, at least in some locales. And, finally, as of July 1, 2012 (with the commendable support of New York's District Attorneys Association) New York has now come into line with the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct (and different iterations of it in place in the past few years in seven states), which requires otherwise hesitant prosecutors to bear in mind the "ethics" of doing nothing when the truth might, to paraphrase Jesus, help set an innocent defendant free.
So now, if a prosecutor knows from new, credible, material evidence that it is reasonably likely that his office has convicted a defendant of a crime he likely didn't commit -- he must (1) notify the court and the defendant of that likelihood, (2) disclose the arguably exonerating evidence and (3) agree to set the conviction aside unless he can find good reason to show otherwise. And if/when the prosecutor acquires "clear and convincing" evidence that the defendant is innocent, he must pursue the applicable remedy to accomplish righting the wrong.
The purpose of the new rule seems so exquisitely obvious but, still, for a prosecutor to comply with it will be an extraordinarily hard thing to do. Hard to admit a wrongful conviction. Hard to acknowledge, even to yourself, that you sent an innocent man to languish in prison for, God knows, how long, while you have gone home every night to enjoy your life. Hard to admit that your career conviction is based on a faulty premise and will, as a result fall asunder of its own weight. Hard to deal with the fact that you will likely become a named defendant in a wrongful conviction civil case against your office. It's just so much easier to just look the other way. After all, you didn't earn megabucks while winning the case back when -- you merely earned a laborer's honest day's pay, all along truly believing in the defendant's guilt. And now you must put a knife in your own gut? Human nature would make righting this wrong difficult for anyone at all -- this is not a poke at prosecutors in particular. Being ethical when the truth stares you down is a hard road to travel -- for anyone. Accordingly, it might be so easy, for example, to toss in the trash bin an inmate's letter proclaiming that his cellmate, imprisoned for an unrelated robbery, has credibly (with the details of an obvious insider) confessed to him that he was the actual murderer, and that the "wrong guy" -- whom you convicted -- is serving life. So easy, indeed! Of course, until now only the prosecutor's conscience stood between the inmate's letter and the round file. Now it will also be an ethics provision (albeit, a hard one to police) that will bolster a prosecutor's willingness to act appropriately upon receipt of the exonerating information. Still, one wonders if an escape hatch exception that exists for New York prosecutors (that, coincidentally, doesn't exist in the ABA's version of the rule) may theoretically swallow the rule. Under the New York version, a prosecutor's independent judgment that the new evidence is not of a sufficient nature to trigger the disclosure obligations, even if later determined to be wrong, won't violate his ethical obligations under the new rule.
One can certainly expect that prosecutors who have chosen to keep the "bad news" of a convicted defendant's possible innocence to themselves will seek to rely on that escape hatch whenever a discipline prosecutor or a court looks askance and in their direction. Time will tell whether, and under what circumstances, discipline authorities will give these criminal prosecutors the benefit of the doubt. That is, the same benefit of the doubt that they didn't give the innocents whom they convicted (even when those prosecutors sincerely believed in the defendants' guilt). Indeed, it is hard to imagine anything more Kafkaesque than a true innocent sitting in jail day after day, while a cynical prosecutor hides the knowledge of his innocence and the keys to the man's freedom in a lockbox in her office credenza. And we needed a new ethics provision to O'Henry the ending to this dark drama?
