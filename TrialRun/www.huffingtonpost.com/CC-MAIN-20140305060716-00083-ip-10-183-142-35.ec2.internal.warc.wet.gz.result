Hoda Kotb Getting Raves For 'Today' Stint

TV News
On Wednesday, New York Times reporter Brian Stelter noticed that a lot of people on Twitter were cheering about Hoda Kotb's week-long stint filling in for Savannah Guthrie on "Today."
Kotb has been filling in much more recently when Lauer or Guthrie is out, and many viewers seemed to like what they saw. "@hodakotb, finally the Meredith/Matt chemistry is back. Please stay. My @todayshow is fixed. #goodstuff," one woman tweeted.
For a show that has been starved for some good feedback from the public, it could only come as happy news to see people reacting positively to a host. FTVLive also heard good things about Kotb. "Why doesn't NBC wake up and realize that Lauer and Hoda is the team they have been looking for?" a person emailed the site.
Kotb's name was famously in the mix after Ann Curry left "Today," but there would appear to be no immediate vacancy for the top job. Savannah Guthrie is comfortably ensconced there, for one. NBC is not likely to undergo a bruising overhaul for the second time in two years, and Kotb's pairing with Kathie Lee Gifford has been a very successful one. For Kotb, though, the public goodwill can only help solidify her standing within the show.
