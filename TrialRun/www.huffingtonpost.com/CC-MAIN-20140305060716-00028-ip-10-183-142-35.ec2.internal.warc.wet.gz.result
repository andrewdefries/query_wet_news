WASHINGTON — An official familiar with the Arizona shooting investigation said Sunday that local authorities are looking at a possible connection between accused gunman Jared Loughner and an online group known for white supremacist, anti-immigrant rhetoric.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation, said local authorities were examining the American Renaissance website for possible motives for Saturday's shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.
American Renaissance is connected to the white supremacist New Century Foundation, according to an analysis by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based group that tracks hate crimes. New Century Foundation founder Jared Taylor has called racial, ethnic and religious diversity "one of the most divisive forces on the planet," according to the Anti-Defamation League.
Taylor on Sunday denied any connection to the accused gunman. "No one by the name of Loughner has ever been a subscriber to American Renaissance or has ever registered for an American Renaissance conference," Taylor wrote on the website.
"American Renaissance condemns violence in the strongest possible terms," Taylor wrote.

Drew Westen: Gun Violence and the Lessons of Tucson: Will the Chambers Once Again Be Loaded Against the American People?
That bringing a concealed weapon within that proximity to an elected official could be legal in the world's longest-lasting democracy is both surreal and shameful -- and now it threatens that democracy. Harry Shearer: The News Doesn't Sleep -- Except on Weekends
News organizations have lately opted to hire fewer reporters, and to cut newsrooms' Saturday staffs. As NPR and Reuters issued erroneous reports of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' death this weekend, the downside of such cuts seems clear.	Lauren Ashburn: Media Fails in Matter of Life and Death
The cardinal rule of journalism is simple: Get it right or don't report it, especially when it comes to matters of life and death. But during live coverage of the shooting in Tucson this weekend, the media got it wrong over and over again.	Richard T. Hughes: Echoes From Gettysburg: How We Can Save Our Country--Part 1
To put it bluntly, by placing their individual interests ahead of the common good, the American people have betrayed the American dream.	Mark Goulston, M.D.: Jared Loughner: Understanding the Arizona Shooter from the Inside Out
From listening to many suicidal and rageful/violent people and hearing information similar to what we are beginning to learn about Loughner, I believe that four factors may have contributed to his actions.	Rabbi Joshua Levine Grater: Needed: Dr. King in Tucson
The values of Dr. King -- love, compassion, nonviolence and tolerance -- are being drowned out by the values of a fringe minority in our country. Priscilla Warner: How to Sit Still When Tragedy Strikes
Many words will be spoken in the aftermath of the killings in Arizona. Action will be taken. Ideas and emotions will be processed. But for now I will sit still, meditate and let time pass. Filed by Elyse Siegel
