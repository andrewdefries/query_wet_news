See update below
The controversial Facebook page Boycott BP, which calls on individuals to "Boycott BP stations until the spill is cleaned up," mysteriously went down on Monday, with visitors automatically redirected to Facebook's home page without explanation.
The page was back up again by early Tuesday morning, but the incident left its over-700,000-strong membership wondering if Facebook attempted to censor them. According to its official description, the Boycott BP Facebook group aims to organize a general boycott of BP stations and brands, which the group lists as "Castrol, Arco, Aral, am/pm, Amoco, and Wild Bean Cafe," until the oil spill is cleaned up.
One person, Yadayadatwin, took to CNN iReport to publicize the disappearance of the Boycott BP group.
"This group was created with the intent of sending a clear and strong message to BP and to Washington that what has happened in the Gulf has to stop everywhere," Yadayadatwin wrote. "People from all over the world shared video clips, pictures, and frustration over what has been seen [as an] incredibly slow process to an ever growing economic and environmental disaster. The question is: Why did Facebook suddenly take down the site? "
Desmond Perkins (aka Bayou Lee), the creator of the Facebook group, tweeted late Monday that his "Facebook account was closed," adding, "boycott bp page was shut down." He established a new Facebook page (Boycott bp/ARCO) while the original was down. His first post on the new protest page read,
Boycott bp/ARCO I can't believe they shut us down with no explanation. I could not even say goodbye to my friends. We must have been doing something right. Calling the media now. bayoulee.com is up and running. ty Bayou Lee
Today, Lee's original Boycott BP page was restored, but he wrote on his website that he has not yet heard an explanation or apology from Facebook:
FaceBook has restored the group Boycott-BP. I am still trying to get an explanation from FaceBook as to why the group was removed and will post any information I get. The PR people, at BP and now FaceBook, are getting a workout these days trying to cover bad press.
I am still working with my Webmaster to add blog capabilities. Keep checking back.
UPDATE: Facebook provided TechCrunch with a statement on the removal of the Boycott BP page, citing a systems "error."
Facebook wrote,
The admin profile of the Boycott BP Page was disabled by our automated systems therefore removing all the content that had been created by the profile. After a manual review we determined the profile was removed in error and it has now been restored along with the Page.
See Diane Sawyer's interview with Perkins in the video below.

As if we didn't already think Joseph Altuzarra was the coolest of the new designers on the block, he posed in one of his own dresses for W's January issue. He told the magazine:
This was my first time fully putting on a dress. Drag's not really my shtick. Maybe it's the very French-Catholic thing, but I'd have to be very drunk. Still, I like how you go to Fire Island and there's an obese drag queen in a sequined bikini splashing around in the water, and it's, like: Great! No judgment!
Altuzarra claims he's not a good dresser:
Not really. One of my biggest pet peeves is well-dressed designers. If you spend that much time thinking about your own clothes, you're not spending enough time thinking about what you're designing.
He remarked, "I'm comfortable with the idea that I'm the flavor of the moment and that in a couple of years people might not think I'm cool anymore." And just what flavor is that?
Maybe the French-export flavor -- although there are some very un-French things about me. For example, I hate cheese; it's moldy and disgusting. And I don't do bone marrow. And I don't eat oysters.
He also addressed the labeling of his clothes as "whorish," noting, "Yes, the clothes are definitely for a woman, not a girl."
Check out Altuzarra in his dress as photographed by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and head over to W to read the rest of the interview.

Sports News
North Carolina State's Bryan Underwood (80) is congratulated by teammates after Underwood's touchdown to tie the game late in the second half of an NCAA college football game against Florida State in Raleigh, N.C., Saturday, Oct. 6, 2012. North Carolina State won 17-16.
RALEIGH, N.C. -- Third-ranked Florida State spent the first half looking every bit like the team picked to win the Atlantic Coast Conference, from a dominating defense to a running game that kept moving the chains to silence a hostile crowd.
Then North Carolina State figured out a way to shake up the race for both the conference and national championship.
Mike Glennon found Bryan Underwood for a 2-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with 16 seconds left, helping the Wolfpack rally to beat the Seminoles 17-16 on Saturday night.
On a night when the Seminoles (5-1, 2-1 ACC) appeared poised to strengthen their grip on their division, they instead found themselves struggling to figure out how N.C. State (4-2, 1-1) had turned the game around and possibly ended FSU's hopes of contending for a BCS title.
"We still control our own destiny in the ACC," FSU coach Jimbo Fisher said. "We have to refocus and not let this loss become two in a row. We let this one slip away from us."
Florida State – carrying its highest ranking since 2003 – led 16-0 at halftime, but couldn't stop Wolfpack quarterback Mike Glennon in the fourth quarter and watched this one slip away in stunning fashion.
"We weren't coming in thinking that we were David and they were Goliath or anything," Wolfpack center Camden Wentz said. "We've beaten this team before. They're a great football team. We weren't coming in not sure if we could win or not. ... At the end, it went our way."
The Wolfpack (4-2, 1-1) inched closer after halftime before coming up with a game-turning blocked punt by Mike Rose with 2:27 left, giving the ball back to Glennon at the FSU 43 with a chance to complete the comeback.
Glennon marched the Wolfpack down the field and completed three fourth-down passes, including two inside the 15. The drive ended when he found Underwood alone over the middle – a step or two into the end zone – to tie the game, allowing the Wolfpack to take the lead on the ensuing point-after kick.
Not bad for a team that committed 14 penalties, coughed up six turnovers and gave up the go-ahead touchdown pass in a 44-37 loss at Miami last weekend.
"It was a dream come true to be honest," Underwood said. "We'd been working hard all week after last week. We just wanted to come out and fight. We just hung in there and played as a team, that's all it was."
FSU drove near midfield in the final seconds, but the Wolfpack defense knocked down EJ Manuel's desperation heave near the goal line to end it. The play sent the Wolfpack players spilling onto the field in celebration.
"This is not the end of the world for us," FSU receiver Rashad Greene said. "We know what we have in this locker room and we will move on from this loss."
It marked the second straight year the Wolfpack had beaten a highly ranked division rival here. Last season, the Wolfpack upset No. 7 Clemson 37-13 for the program's first win against a top-10 team under Tom O'Brien.
This game marked the first time a top-five team had come to Carter-Finley Stadium since 1998. And just as in that game, unranked N.C. State upset the Seminoles, who were ranked No. 2 at the time.
"This is as good as it gets," Glennon said.
The win also changed the race in the ACC's Atlantic Division. The Seminoles had already beaten Clemson at home, so a win at N.C. State would've given them victories against the two teams projected to be their biggest challengers for the division crown.
FSU hosts Boston College next weekend.
As for N.C. State, the Wolfpack knew this was probably their last chance to stay in the division race.
N.C. State never led until Glennon's late pass and Niklas Sade's PAT. N.C. State had just 68 yards and four first downs in the first half, with the Seminoles using a short touchdown pass from Manuel and three field goals from Dustin Hopkins to take the 16-0 lead.
But the FSU team that was in such control going into the locker room isn't the one that came out for the second half.
Chris Thompson ran for 115 of his 141 yards in the first half for the Seminoles, while Manuel threw for 218 yards with an interception. Florida State managed just 122 yards after halftime and squandered all three of their timeouts, which proved crucial once the Wolfpack finally pushed in front.
Glennon threw for 259 yards on 30-for-55 passing with two touchdowns, the first being a 24-yard scoring pass to Shadrach Thornton that brought the Wolfpack within 16-10 with 13:47 to play. Then, after Rose's blocked punt, Glennon calmly moved N.C. State into striking range with a 12-yard pass to Quintin Payton on fourth-and-10 that gave N.C. State a first-and-goal at the 2 with 1:07 left.
Then he hit Underwood for touchdown that helped change the direction of the season in the ACC and beyond.

The decision to target and kill Osama Bin Laden is being applauded by all decent people. Approval to capture or kill this mass-murdering terrorist leader was given by Presidents Obama and Bush. It was the right decision, both morally and legally.
Although Bin Laden wore no military uniform and held no official military rank, he was an appropriate military target. As the titular and spiritual head of Al Qaeda, he was the functional equivalent of a head of state or commander in chief of a terrorist army. From the beginning of recorded history, killing the king was the legitimate object of military action. The very phrase "check mate" means "the king is dead, "signifying the successful end of the battle.
Yet there are those who claim that all targeted killings are immoral and illegal. These critics characterize such actions as "extrajudicial executions" and demand that terrorist leaders and functionaries be treated as common criminals who must be arrested and brought to trial.
The operation that resulted in Bin Laden's death was a military action calculated to kill rather than to "arrest" him. It is possible, though highly unlikely, that he could have been captured alive and brought to trial. The decision to employ military personnel with guns, rather than a drone firing rockets, was probably made by generals rather than lawyers.
Had it been militarily preferable to fire a rocket, that option would almost certainly have been selected--as it was by the NATO forces that rocketed Ghadafy's compound. A rocket attack would have been a pure targeted killing with no possibility of live capture. The operation directed against Bin Laden may have been designed, in part, to have preserved the theoretical option of "arrest", though the likelihood of a live capture was virtually impossible under the circumstances. Indeed it is likely that Bin Laden's death was deemed preferential to his capture and trial, because the latter would have raised the probability that Al Qaeda would take hostages and try to exchange them for Bin Laden.
Indeed, a US national security official has confirmed to Reuters that "this was a kill operation" and there was no desire to capture Bin Laden alive. This was a targeted kill appropriate for a military combatant but not for an ordinary (or even extraordinary) criminal.
Nonetheless, our government felt it necessary to announce that Bin Laden was shot after he allegedly resisted thus suggesting he was not killed in cold blood. But it is clear that he would have been killed whether or not he resisted, since this was a kill operation from the outset and it is unlikely he was ever given the opportunity to surrender an opportunity not required under the laws of war.
Accordingly, those who have opposed the very concept of targeted killings should be railing against the killing of Osama Bin Laden.
Among others, these critics include officials in Britain, France, Italy, Russia, the EU, Jordan, and the United Nations. Former British Foreign Secretary once said, "The British government has made it repeatedly clear that so-called targeted assassinations of this kind are unlawful, unjustified and counterproductive." The French foreign ministry has declared "that extrajudicial executions contravene international law and are unacceptable." The Italian Foreign Minister has said, "Italy, like the whole of the European Union, has always condemned the practice of targeted assassinations." The Russians have asserted that "Russia has repeatedly stressed the unacceptability of extrajudicial settling of scores and 'targeted killings.'" Javier Solana has noted that the "European Union has consistently condemned extrajudicial killings." The Jordanians have said, "Jordan has always denounced this policy of assassination and its position on this has always been clear." And Kofi Annan has declared "that extrajudicial killings are violations of international law."
Yet none of these nations, groups or individuals have criticized the targeted killing of Osama Bin Laden by the US. The reason is obvious. All the condemnations against targeted killing was directed at one country. Guess which one? Israel, of course. Israel developed the concept of targeted killings and used it effectively against the "Osama Bin Laden's" of Hamas, who directed terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians, killing and wounding more Israelis, as a percentage of its population, than the number killed by Bin Laden. It was when Israel managed to kill the head of Hamas, that the international community, with the striking exception of the United States, decided that targeted killing was illegal and immoral.
But now that it has been used against an enemy of Britain, France, Italy and other European nations, the tune has changed. Suddenly targeted killing is not only legal and moral, it is praiseworthy (except, of course, to Hamas, which immediately condemned the US killing of Bin Laden). Well the truth is that when used properly, targeted killing has always been deserving of approval--even when employed by Israel, a nation against which a double standard always seems to be applied.
Indeed, in Israel, the use of targeted killings has been closely regulated by its Supreme Court and permitted only against terrorists who are actively engaged in ongoing acts of terrorism. In the United States, on the other hand, the decisions to use this tactic is made by the President alone, without any form of judicial review. So let the world stop applying a double standard to Israel and let it start judging the merits and demerits of military tactics such as targeted killing. On balance, targeted killing, when used prudently against proper military targets, can be an effective, lawful, and moral tool in the war against terrorism. **Alan Dershowitz's latest novel is The Trials of Zion.

According to the Internal Revenue Service, those who have debts that have been forgiven may have to pay taxes on the forgiven amount. That comes as a surprise at tax season when homeowners who have received a mortgage cancellation or forgiveness also receive a dreaded 1099C, entitled Cancellation of Debt, in the mail. What is canceled mortgage debt? In this circumstance, canceled or forgiven debt applies to loan modifications that resulted in a reduction of the amount of debt owed, as well as forgiven mortgage debt that occurred due to foreclosure. Does a homeowner have to pay taxes on mortgage debt that's been forgiven or canceled? Some reduced or canceled debts do have to be treated as income, but not all. It depends on their circumstances and the amount of debt. The federal government, knowing that taxing cancelled mortgage debt is like rubbing salt in a wound, established the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act in 2007 to provide guidelines for the kind and amount of canceled debt that is taxable, and providing exclusions which can save you from having to pay taxes on some forgiven debts. In most cases, the Act excludes mortgage forgiveness, reduction, or cancellation from taxation. However, there are restrictions, and you need to be aware of what they are in order to know if you have to claim the forgiven debt as taxable income. The basic qualifications for exclusion include:
The forgiven debt must be on your principal residence (rental and business properties do not qualify).
The amount forgiven must exceed $600 (lesser amounts do not qualify).
The debt must have been forgiven between 2007 and 2012.
The amount excluded is limited to $2 million. If married filing separately, that amount drops to $1 million (any amount over those limits are subject to taxation).
Bankruptcies are also included in this Act, which states that "debts discharged due to bankruptcy are not considered taxable income." The forgiven or canceled amount of second mortgages and funds used to refinance a principal residence are also viewed as non-taxable, but the amount cannot exceed the amount of the original (first) mortgage before refinancing. In addition, the debt must be secured by the property and must have been used to buy, build or improve the home. For example, if John Doe used the equity in his home to secure a second mortgage in the amount of $30,000, but used $10,000 to pay off his credit card debt, the $10,000 is taxable because it wasn't used to buy, build or improve his residence. For more information on mortgage forgiveness in first or second mortgages and refinances, see Publication 4681, Canceled Debts, Foreclosures, Repossessions, and Abandonments. Additional information can be found in the IRS news release IR-2008-17.
Do you still have to report the cancelled debt, even if it qualifies for exclusion? Yes. If your canceled debt is $600 or more, your lender is required to send you Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt. The amount of debt canceled can be found in Box 2 of this form. Your lender also reports this amount to the IRS. To report canceled debt on your income tax return, you'll need to attach Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness, to your return. It's a relatively simple process. Those with canceled mortgage debt due to foreclosure only have to complete lines 1e and 2. Those who received a reduction in debt due to loan modification should complete lines 1e, 2, and 10b. The form can be downloaded at the link above or by visiting www.irs.gov. Those who wish to receive Form 982 by mail should call 1-800-829-3676. If you don't believe that the cancellation of your mortgage debt qualifies under this Act, there is still hope that you won't have to pay income tax on that amount. The Act also states that canceled or forgiven debt due to insolvency may apply. Insolvency simply means that you have more debt than assets. If your total debt exceeds the value of all your assets, you are considered insolvent. Form 982 is used to claim this exclusion, too. Again, you don't have to complete the entire form -- to claim insolvency, you need to check Box 1b. Determine the amount of canceled debt and the amount by which you were insolvent (total debts minus total assets). Insert the smaller of those two figures on Line 2 of Form 982. By following the instructions and completing Form 982, you can take advantage of this opportunity to avoid having to pay taxes on your forgiven mortgage debt. Reporting that debt is required, regardless if your debt qualifies as an exclusion or not. If you're unsure if you qualify, you can contact a tax professional or call the IRS tax assistance line at 800-829-1040.

This post was originally published on BallinMichigan.com. What started as mild intrigue about the City of Detroit years ago for Fenton High School teacher and J.V. basketball coach Nick Gregory has now resulted in countless hours spent in the city, listening to stories and doing documentary photography work, some of which will be on display through Oct. 7 at Grand Rapids Art Prize in an exhibition entitled Split.
Like many from the suburbs -- Gregory is an Ionia native -- his fascination with the city began with sports.
"It was just a curiosity for me," Gregory said. "Growing up, I used to go to baseball games at Tiger Stadium, but I never really experienced the city. One day about six or seven years ago, I just jumped in my car and started driving around there. I was in awe of the size and everything there is to see there. It has just turned into a fascination for me."
During that time, Gregory has compiled an archive featuring many photos and stories of various sections of Detroit and its residents. This year is his second Detroit-themed exhibition at Art Prize. Last year, he presented an exhibition called, Detroit Today, which he said was more of a general display while Split is more focused on a theme.
Here is how Gregory described his inspiration and the focus of Split:
Divisions, intolerance and a biased political process have influenced Detroit for several decades before and since the 1967 riots. The idea for Split was born after meeting Detroiters who live behind the Wailing Wall, built in the 1940's to separate white and black neighborhoods. I found it compelling that these residents had such a blatant, physical reminder of racism literally in their backyards. This led me on a journey to learn more about how barriers of the past still haunt the city today. I wanted to let the people tell their city's story themselves.
In his years documenting and getting to know the city and its people, he's been struck by how the people and their values are not much different in Detroit than anywhere else. However, the city's history has played a major role in both how Detroit and its people are perceived now.
"I truly believe Detroit is the most misunderstood city in America," Gregory said.
The challenge is to get people to understand how the political process throughout history has shaped that whole region. You can't excuse the real problems the city is facing today, but it helps to understand how it got to this point. This is a city where they literally built a wall at one time to separate the white and black neighborhoods. The history of Detroit is very complex, and it helps partially explain what is going on in the city today. I think people need to understand and come to grips with that history for Detroit to be a great city again. How can we all not be better (in Michigan) with Detroit thriving again?
Part of Gregory's attraction to the projects he's worked on in Detroit is because they've been educational for him as well as an artistic pursuit.
"I'm embarrassed as a high school graduate and a college graduate about how little I knew about the city and its history until I started studying it," Gregory said.
As a teacher himself, he's also been able to use what he learns in the city in his classroom.
"I teach social studies, and Detroit is like the ultimate social studies case study," he said. "We can look back at its history and see what was tried there and was successful or what was tried there and failed and learn from that. The more I learn there, the more I'm able to bring stories into the classroom and the more my students get curious about it and ask questions."
As a basketball coach and as a sports fan in general, Gregory noted the role that sports have played in the city's history.
"The 1968 Tigers were kind of a rallying point, a team that everyone could get behind (after the Detroit race riots in 1967)," Gregory said. "Sports are truly about both athletic ability and how well people are able to work together and those are concepts that people of all different backgrounds can relate to."
As a coach today, particularly a basketball coach, where players from inner-cities and suburbs alike often play in the same AAU tournaments and spend time together in summers, there are also great opportunities for sports as a tool to break down some of the historical divides that have existed in places like Detroit.
"An interest in sports opens a door to kids to the concept that we are all probably more similar than we are different," Gregory said.
Gregory said his hope for those who see his exhibition is that it is informative and that it doesn't reinforce negative preconceived notions that people may have about the city.
"I don't want to be reinforcing a perception that people already have -- the people who see a picture and say basically, 'Yep, that's what I thought Detroit looked like,' and move on," Gregory said. "This project is meant to be educational, to show the history of the city, and hopefully expose people to the complexity of the city. For me, the most gratifying part of displaying the work is just observing people as they look and seeing the reactions they have, or hearing the conversations they have. That was the cool part for me about doing it too -- it truly has been educational. I've learned so much."
Gregory's 28-piece exhibition is currently on display at DeVos Skyway in Grand Rapids.
