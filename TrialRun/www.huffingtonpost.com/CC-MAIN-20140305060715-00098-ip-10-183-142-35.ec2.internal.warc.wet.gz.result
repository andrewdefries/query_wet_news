WASHINGTON -- The failure of Congress to authorize a budget for the Federal Aviation Administration has put some 4,000 agency employees and tens of thousands of contractors temporarily out of work. But even some FAA workers who haven't been furloughed find themselves in a peculiar financial jam. Roughly 40 FAA inspectors have been asked to continue working despite the stoppage because their jobs are important for air safety. Yet since Congress hasn't allocated money to the agency, these employees have to cover their own travel expenses until the shutdown is resolved. Although their wages and expenses will eventually be recouped, these workers will end up covering work-related credit charges -- and possibly interest -- until funding is freed up. The inspectors are among the thousands who will suffer the real consequences of congressional deadlock. "It's incredibly unfair," FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday. "We can neither pay them nor compensate them" for their expenses until the shutdown ends.
Babbitt and transportation secretary Ray LaHood had urged the Senate to pass a bill Tuesday before the chamber breaks for recess and lawmakers head home, leaving thousands out of a job until September. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) asked her colleagues to pass a House bill without its most controversial elements, but Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) objected to Boxer's request. Largely lost in the all-consuming debt ceiling debate, the FAA shutdown is now closing in on two weeks. The agency hasn't had a long-term funding plan since 2007, instead relying on a series of short-term extensions, the last of which expired July 22. House Republicans have left Democrats with few attractive options. The most recent short-term funding bill passed by the House cuts money for rural airports, including several that lie in states with Democratic senators. Meanwhile, the long-term funding bill passed by the House would make it harder for air and rail workers to unionize, a provision that could infuriate the labor community.
With the process stalled, Democrats fumed over what they described as a shotgun approach to negotiating by Republicans.
"The House Republicans' insistence on attaching anti-worker provisions to an aviation bill has brought about a terrible stalemate that is hurting the economy," Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) said in a statement. "From day 1, House GOP leaders admitted openly -- almost proudly -- that they were doing this to gain 'leverage' toward a larger goal -- undermining worker rights."
House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said the FAA standoff is just the latest example of how House Republicans have put politics ahead of good faith efforts to pass legislation. "They were clearly prepared to let America default for the first time in history on its debts unless they got their way," Hoyer said. And now, "They were prepared to leave Washington ... with almost 4,000 federal employees out on the street."
As a result, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was "confronted with a terrible decision" of either passing the GOP bill or not reauthorizing the FAA, Hoyer added. LaHood said he has been in continuing talks with lawmakers and hoped Democrats would "swallow hard" and pass a bill that many of them found distasteful. "The only option that we have is the House bill that a lot of senators don't like," LaHood said, arguing that too many jobs were on the line. "We are smack dab in the middle of the construction season. We ... have heard many, many grandiose speeches by members of Congress about creating jobs and putting people to work. This is not the way to put people to work." President Obama called the impasse "another Washington-inflicted wound on America," and on the Senate floor, Boxer said the Republican maneuvers amounted to "hostage taking." Although the rural airport service cuts amount to a mere $16.5 million, the stalemate has already cost the federal government more than $250 million in airfare taxes that can't be collected until legislation is passed. Worse yet, the stoppage has taken paychecks out of the pockets of thousands of public- and private-sector workers who were either furloughed or saw their projects temporarily shuttered. According to the FAA, the lawmakers' spat has held up $2.5 billion that should be going to airport projects across the country. The trade group Associated General Contractors of America estimates that the stoppage has affected 70,000 workers, many of whom have been told to go home until the FAA money comes through and the stop-work orders are lifted. Most FAA employees have not been furloughed, since some workers' funding is secure regardless of the reauthorization bill. But other workers aren't so fortunate, like Michael Weatherby, a computer specialist who was furloughed 11 days ago.
Weatherby, who normally works at the William J. Hughes Technical Center at Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey, said the irony isn't lost on him that congressional leaders might take flights home for recess without passing an FAA bill.
"All I hear is jobs, jobs, jobs out of Washington, and here they are to put us out of work," said Weatherby, who works on cybersecurity issues.
Weatherby, 43, said the furlough has put serious financial strains on his family. Although his wife continues to work her job with Atlantic County, the two have to support not only themselves but her elderly parents as well. Weatherby said he's already started dipping into his savings and doesn't know how long it will last. His colleagues have started using their vacation time and have been told they should start applying for unemployment. "It's getting desperate at this point," he said. "The senselessness of all this is amazing."

Bob Cesca: The American People Lost the Debt Ceiling Debate
We lost. Middle and working class Americans. We're the losers in the debt ceiling debate. Not President Obama or the Democrats. And it was always going to be this way. As soon as deficit reduction became the only game in town. Chris Weigant: No FAA Bill? No-Fly List.
Congress has chosen its priorities -- a month of paid vacation is more important to them than doing the work they have been hired to do. This is unacceptable. Lloyd Chapman: Executive Order Could Slash Jobs Deficit
Congress' focus is in the wrong place. The biggest challenge the U.S. faces right now is the jobs deficit, not the budget deficit. Unemployment rates determine a healthy and functioning economy, and those rates are reaching new heights. Joe Peyronnin: Obama's Jobs Pivot
Mr. President, why would you think that Republicans, who control the House and can prevent cloture in the Senate, would ever do anything that may help get you re-elected? Job number one for you is job creation -- please take the lead.	Jay Mandle: The Opportunity Provided by the "Deal" Debacle
The right's success rests on one very solid foundation. The American people do not trust their government to serve their interests.	Jeff Reeves: Congress Is Creating Layoffs -- Not Jobs
Whatever the motivations in Washington, the truth of the matter is that the biggest job destroyer in 2011 has been the government. Bill George: Debt Ceiling Agreement: No Cause for Celebration
This week's agreement to increase the U.S. debt ceiling is no cause for celebration. The political landscape is covered with the blood of all the politicians who were losers in this "no win" battle.

WASHINGTON -- A new agreement between the United States and the European Union that will tighten privacy protections for sharing air passenger data is being hailed by Europeans as a big improvement over despised Bush-era rules that many believe trampled their rights. Although the Obama administration had hoped to keep the current anti-terrorism rules in place, the new deal will allow the Department of Homeland Security to continue vacuuming up information on the 22 million Americans and Europeans, as well as other foreign nationals, who cross the Atlantic every year. It will replace an interim 2007 U.S.-E.U. agreement on the use of passenger name records (PNR).
The current system is "operationally effective and has a pristine record on data and privacy protection. We didn't think there was a need for a new agreement," David Heyman, the assistant homeland security secretary for policy, told The Huffington Post. "But given the [2009 Lisbon Treaty] changes and concerns about privacy and data protection among some Europeans, the U.S. undertook negotiations to reinforce our longstanding and vital alliance with Europe to fight transnational threats."
Europeans have enshrined the right to "private and family life" and the "protection of personal data" in their founding document of union and have been wary about sharing information with the U.S. ever since Congress passed the Patriot Act in 2001. After the Lisbon Treaty gave the European Parliament more say over international agreements, it demanded that the PNR arrangement be renegotiated.
Congress, in responding to the 9/11 attacks, mandated that air carriers provide PNR data on every flight coming into the U.S. PNRs consist of information that travelers provide when they book their flights; the records have 19 data points, including itinerary, date of birth, payment method, contact information, seat assignment and traveling companions. The Department of Homeland Security runs the records through terrorist watch lists and other databases to help identify known threats early and spot others who adopt suspicious behaviors.
Officials say PNR data has aided many recent high-profile terrorism investigations, including those involving David Headley, who pleaded guilty to planning the Mumbai terrorist attack; Faisal Shazad, the would-be Times Square bomber; and Najibullah Zazi, who admitted to a plot to bomb New York City subways. PNRs also have been used in nearly every human-smuggling case involving air travel.
"The EU data privacy advocates have traditionally sought to make it harder to connect the dots -- exactly the opposite of what the 9/11 Commission recommended," said former Bush Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, who worked out the current framework. "These 'improvements' will make it somewhat more difficult to detect threats. But it could be a lot worse."
Although both sides have initialed the new agreement, it won't replace the existing rules until the Council and Parliament of the European Union approve it. Given the current euro financial crisis, that may not happen until next year.
The new agreement is crafted to allay what one senior U.S. official called "a huge lack of trust that evolved" during the Bush years, thanks to the Iraq war, extraordinary renditions and the Guantanamo Bay prison, and that has carried over into the current administration.
Among the changes:
Clearer limits. PNR data will be used only to fight terrorism and serious transnational crimes, such as drug smuggling and human trafficking, that are punishable by three or more years in prison. The goal is to end the use of PNR data in investigating minor crimes or immigration violations. Still, U.S. officials will have some wiggle room since PNR data may also be used "on a case-by-case basis" and "to identify persons who would be subject to closer questioning or examination upon arrival to or departure from the United States or who may require further examination."
Shorter record retention. The Department of Homeland Security is currently authorized to store identifiable PNR data for 15 years, the last eight in a dormant database. The new deal renders PNR data anonymous after six months and moves it to a dormant database after five years. Except for records linked to terrorism, data storage will be limited to 10 years.
U.S. officials argued unsuccessfully to retain active records for five years. "The Europeans were fixated, very much focused on the retention periods," Heyman said, insisting, "In the end, we added in privacy protections but did not limit our operational ability."
Legal certainty for air carriers. The new rules require airlines to send, or "push," PNR data to U.S. authorities. Currently, Homeland Security is allowed to "pull" data directly from airlines' reservation systems.
Safeguards against profiling. Homeland Security will be required to use automated systems to filter out and mask sensitive data, such as racial or ethnic origin, that could be used to illegally profile passengers.
"We're quite satisfied with the overall compromise and balance," said Michele Cercone, spokesman for European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmström. "E.U. citizens will have the same protections as U.S. citizens. We went as far as we could."
But Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, called the new agreement "very problematic" from the European perspective. Despite language in the deal that states all individuals, regardless of nationality, will be able to correct or erase PNR data and to seek administrative or judicial redress in American courts, the Privacy Act of 1974 still applies only to U.S. citizens and "permanent resident aliens."
"My expectation is there is still likely to be a huge political battle" when it reaches the European Parliament, Rotenberg said. "I don't think this is going to resolve the problems."
The text of the agreement can be read here.

The pas de deux, performed for weeks by Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel, is slowly easing eurozone members into becoming the United States of Europe. Frankly as political theater, it's enormously well-executed and deserves a Broadway Tony. Jeff Cimbalo: One Continent, Under France and Germany
Looks like the EU has found an alternative to German domination of everybody else. It's the French-German domination of everybody else. Attendees should not be surprised to see new details on the fly that "must" be agreed to or risk destroying the eurozone and the EU. Around the Web:

FlixMaster CEO Erika Trautman Wants To Show You Interactive Video (WATCH)

Erika Trautman, FlixMaster's founder and CEO.
Maybe you've watched the trailer for "Dishonored," the choose-your-own-adventure style video lets you step into the shoes of the game's supernatural assassin protagonist and make choices that affect the game. Or maybe you've seen the One Kings Lane promotion (video above) that lets you set a table tailored to your tastes and the items in your house. Or maybe you've never heard of interactive video, in which case FlixMaster CEO Erika Trautman is about to expand your world. For those not in the know: Interactive video is video the user can interact with, whether by changing the plot of a story, choosing to open a door or clicking a button marked “more information.” Trautman's web-based tool FlixMaster turns creating an interactive video from an intricate engineering feat to a simple drag-and-drop experience. In a phone interview with the Huffington Post, Trautman compares FlixMaster to website-builder WordPress: “You can obviously create a website before Wordpress, but you had to be technically savvy and you had to manage it top to bottom. Wordpress comes along and makes it so easy that not only can everyone create a website, everyone is creating a website.” Trautman hopes to replicate WordPress’s success, and with high-profile clientele already producing with her product (including flash-sales site One King’s Lane) she looks like she’s well on her way.
But what inspired filmmaker Trautman and her husband, game designer Cameron McCaddon, to co-create an interactive video company? “I’d say I didn’t hear the words 'interactive video' until we were already starting to build it,” says Trautman. She and McCaddon were inspired to start the company when collaborating on an interactive “game-like” series, for which they tried to produce nested video. "As we looked around for technology, we realized, 'Sure, we can do this, we’re gonna have to hire engineers, hard-code this experience. This isn’t low-friction.' It’s definitely heavy engineering lifting just to get this off the ground," she says.
Looking for projects like the game the duo hoped to build, search results piqued the pair’s already-whetted interest. Says Trautman, "We started to see a lot of really innovative, largely one-off video experiences, people had engineered what we had thought of doing, which was 'Let me build one, to get it out into the world', so it’d be these massive labors of full creative and engineering effort to create them." Trautman and McCaddon concluded that this was territory ripe for entrepreneurship, and not just as a provider for a niche market, either. "We realized that the functionalities we were seeking for this game-ified video experience were really really broad,” says Trautman. “They were great for trans-medium storytelling, but they were also great for anywhere you’re using video to communicate. From education to shopping videos to customer support. It really was very, very broad." The pair briefly considered starting the company in the San Francisco Bay Area, concluded that the cost of living was too expensive and moved out to Boulder, Colorado because Trautman had just seen the mountain town's tech scene written up in the New York Times. Once based there, even more benefits of the mountainous region began to emerge: “It’s never easy to recruit, but recruiting in Boulder compared to recruiting in New York or the [Silicon] Valley is easier.”
Since launching in 2012, FlixMaster has attracted more than 3,000 users and has been used for high-profile projects, including the "Sights Unseen," the web-only prequel to USA Network's "Covert Affairs" series.
Given a chance to brag about her company as it stands now, Trautman seizes it: “Oh my God, I mean there’s so much that we’re proud of. We’ve got an amazing engineering team who are, like, the foremost world experts in HTML5, which is still pretty darn new. That’s fantastic, and look at what we’ve managed to build on so few resources in a very short period of time, and that’s really fantastic. We’ve had really amazing customers who are creative, and it’s just a pleasure to work with them every day.” That said, she tells us laughingly, her CEO style may be enthused to the point of obsessive: “I am so all-consumed with FlixMaster. It is what I go to bed thinking about, what I wake up in the morning thinking about.” It’s hard not to appreciate the enthusiasm that’s pushed Trautman to where she is now, and which, by all indications, is powering FlixMaster towards the future as she wishes it to be. With the tool and several showcases under her belt, the FlixMaster CEO reveals her ultimate plan: to revolutionize the world of video watching. “In 18 months, 2 years, if all you can do on your video is hit play or hit pause, it’ll be like, ‘It’s broken, why can’t I do more with it?’" predicts Trautman. "This is where video is gonna go, and we want to be the technology that powers that.” In her excitement, she enthuses, “We want to make interactive video really ubiquitous, we want to make it simple, we want to make it pleasurable...we’re just starting to scratch the surface in terms of what we can do.”

About three months ago I was chatting with a New York City nun after mass about the CDF (Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) crackdown on nuns. "It will backfire," Sister said. "The LCWR (Leadership Conference of Women Religious) won't back down," she chuckled. Sister was laughing not because the situation was funny -- earlier in our conversation she had spoken of how hurt members of her "community" were -- but because the siege was absurd. The Vatican had nothing to gain by staging a tantrum and humiliating the nuns. Like a cool-headed mom managing a child demanding candy in the supermarket checkout line, the LCWR waited for the histrionics to pass, and yesterday a statement was released and Sister Pat Farrell the outgoing president of the LWCR commented, and left off with this eloquent, back-handed and not at all veiled (so to speak) insult: ""They can crush a few flowers, but they cannot hold back the springtime."
Sister Pat Farrell explained that she had learned this saying while working in Chile under a dictator. One need not examine the analogy all that closely in order to see that the crushed flowers are nuns; the springtime is the evolving, Christ-centered church; and that the Holy Father and his armies, for the purposes of this analogy would seem to be mass-murdering Chilean despot Augosto Pinochet and his armies. I have heard it said that Roman Catholic priest and peace activist Father Roy Bourgeois, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, a (Vietnam) Purple Heart, women's ordination advocate and founder of SOA Watch, claims his experience with dictators prepared him to contend with the Vatican (which has, within the past year, sought to defrock him). It would seem Sister Pat Farrell learned a thing or two, also, from a tyrant during her time as church worker in Chile. (Pinochet is not a SOA graduate but many of his intelligence agents were.) Nine hundred representatives of the LCWR approved of public response issued on Aug. 10, in which the LCWR resolves to enter a dialogue with the Seattle's Archbishop J. Peter Sartain of Seattle, who has been appointed to serve as their "minder"; push for equality in the church; and work to achieve an environment more hospitable to the discussion of differences. Farrell notes the LCWR's refusal to "compromise" on their "mission" -- and adds that the "dialogue on doctrine is not going to be our starting point" -- which really means: "Both the women and the men will set the agenda." On the face, the LCWR appears willing to play nice, but the Vatican may be more interested in monologue than dialogue. There are many reasons for the sisters to take the high road, not the least of which is that the nuns are more interested in peace than in domination. And there are practical reasons. Ratzinger signs the payroll checks.
There is a curious "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" aspect to this conflict. The men (Vatican et al) want the women to do and say what they are told or, failing that, just keep silent. The women have been saying all along: "Let's discuss doctrine as it applies to contraception, sexuality, and 'right to life' issues beyond abortion." It is a bit ironic that both the accusations and the punishment in this conflict could center on dialogue, given that what landed the witches in the pontiff's caldron in the first place was the refusal of nuns to pipe down. The crime was talk. The penalty? Talk. William Levada, an American cardinal in Rome who up until recently headed up the CDF, has warned that the Vatican might "withdraw official recognition" from orders that fail to act in compliance with CDF mandates. While "official recognition" by the current pontificate probably means little to many LCWR nuns, the withdrawal of it would be catastrophic for those within and outside of the LCWR. "Withdrawal of recognition" could result in nuns losing jobs ministering to the poorest of the poor, neediest of the needy and sickest of the sick. Nuns under such punishment could lose their homes, health care and retirement benefits. Withdrawing "official recognition" would cost the Vatican, too. Nuns work cheap. The effects on Catholic hospitals and schools would be catastrophic. The last thing the scandal-ridden Vatican needs now is to be forced to root around India and sub-Saharan Africa in haste searching for nuns who know how to behave. The smart move for Ratzinger now would be to back off. He won't. The "Apostolic Visitations" now will be seen as a vigilance-developing wakeup call. If the CDF is right, and convents are secret think tanks for women's ordination, radical feminist politics and liberation theology, progressive nuns will continue doing what they have been doing -- but under deeper cover. That is what activists do. Bullies get their motors running. Dictatorial muscle unleashes the beast.
The CDF may have done the LCWR a favor this past spring, when it hurled its "finest" (nuns) under the bus. Every nun who was disgusted with the Apostolic Visitations is now on high alert thanks to the CDF's Captain Queegish smack-down.

Contract For The American Dream, The One Percent, Teach-Ins,

Yesterday evening, something historic happened in the homes, campuses, and community centers of America. From Biloxi, Mississippi to Monrovia, California, more than 4,000 people attended 375 teach-ins -- all volunteer-driven -- to learn "How the 1% Crashed the Economy, and What We Can Do About It." The Occupy Wall Street movement has struck a chord with millions of Americans. It has given direction to our outrage and inspired curiosity about certain fundamental questions. How could the richest country in the history of the world find itself in such a grave economic crisis? How could the wealthiest in our society score record-breaking profits, while millions of Americans struggle?
People are searching for both answers and solutions. So Rebuild The Dream Innovation Fund (an organization I co-founded) and our partners created a special curriculum -- a teach-in toolkit to help people make sense of what's happening in America. The teach-ins are based on an evocative slide presentation that describes the state of our economy, how we got here, and what we as progressives must do to restore the economy and reclaim our democracy. November 9th was just a start. The materials and information are available online for anyone to host a teach-in, tailored to our own communities. In addition to powerful facts, the presentation weaves a powerful story. Ryan Senser, who created the story and the presentation, breaks down the narrative as follows: "We all have dreams, and freedom means being able to pursue them. But right now, the vast majority of people can't move forward because we're hitting a wall. It's a wall of extreme inequality, of debt, of joblessness, of social division. It's the largest barrier to opportunity we've seen since the 1920s, and it's holding our country back. We know who built this wall - Wall Street. Wall Street big corporations and the 1% built it, paid off our politicians to help them do it. And these are Wall Street's results: extreme inequality, which always leads to economic disaster for rest of us. We must elect politicians who will help us pave the path to shared prosperity, and not build walls that keep us from it."
Another major contributor to the teach-in curriculum was Heather McGhee, an economic policy expert at progressive think tank Demos, which works to create a more robust democracy and fair economy. Heather explained why the precursors of our crisis are key to understanding how we move forward as a nation. "The economy is not like the weather," she said. "It's not something that goes up and goes down and that we have no control over as human beings. It's actually a very human-made structure in our political system that is guided by the decisions we make together as a people in a well-functioning democracy."
Our society today, which grants everything to the 1% at the expense of the rest of us, puts greed over common good, justice for some over justice for all, and next quarter over next generation. This is not an accident. As Heather said, "The personal, individual problems that keep us up at night -- student debt, foreclosures, mortgages, credit cards, why rent is up and housing prices are down, why work isn't paying how it used to, why both parents have to work and there's no support for child care -- all of these private questions are part of our story. And the story says there are public causes and public solutions that have evolved over the last 3 decades." In the 1930s, America emerged from the Great Depression with a vengeance. Ordinary American wrested the unjust concentration of political and economic power from the hands of the 1% to build the first and biggest middle class the world had ever seen. Our great-grandparents and grandparents deliberately paved a road to shared prosperity. But starting in the 1970s, the 1% again began to tear away at the accomplishments of our predecessors and they built the wall again. We overcame once and we will overcome again. The Occupy movement has set off a wave of energy and enthusiasm that is determined to tear down the wall built by the 1% and create an economy that works for all. November 17th will be a day of mass action for the 99% to begin tearing down that wall. And possible solutions have already been outlined in the Contract for the American Dream created by 131,000 Americans and signed by over 300,000. We will continue taking to the streets, starting with the mass mobilization on November 17th. Across the country, there will be hundreds of events at the very places that can put America back to work: our crumbling bridges, understaffed schools, and other sites that represent a failed economy. And next year we will occupy voting booths and ballots all over the country. We must continue growing the extraordinary momentum of the 99%. The story we weave about ourselves, our economy, and the political power we hold will shape how we move forward from this unprecedented moment. We will tear down this wall.
