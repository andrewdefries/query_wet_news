WASHINGTON — In a major breakthrough, union leaders bowed Thursday to White House demands for a new tax on high-cost insurance plans as part of landmark health care legislation taking final shape in intensive negotiations. "We are on the doorstep" of success, President Barack Obama said.
The tentative agreement on the tax, which included significant concessions by the administration, was disclosed as leading lawmakers set an informal timetable of Friday for a compromise on the health care bill that Obama made a top priority in taking office a year ago.
Democrats expressed the hope that the agreement would quickly open the way for progress on other key issues where House and Senate-passed bills differ, as well as attempts by the White House to squeeze additional financial concessions from drug makers, nursing homes and other health care providers.
On a separate issue, makers of generic drugs, backed by the White House and a senior congressional ally, sought to reduce the patent protection that pharmaceutical companies receive for their new-to-market biotech products. The House and Senate bills both limit competition for 12 years, but Obama told Democrats he wanted changes.
The fast-paced events came as senior lawmakers spent parts of a second consecutive day at the White House for bargaining over terms of a final compromise, and Obama gave a rousing speech to rank and file House Democrats in a late-afternoon appearance in the Capitol complex.
Referring to polls that show lagging support for the legislation, he told Democrats, "I know how big a lift this has been."
In remarks that look ahead to the fall campaign, he added, "If Republicans want to campaign against what we've done by standing up for the status quo and by standing up for insurance companies over American families, that is a fight I want to have."
Later in a closed-door session with lawmakers, Obama said that once the bill is signed, he intends to travel the country in a series of election-year appearances designed to trumpet the changes it would make, Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo., said.
"That was important for members to hear," Polis said. "They wanted to make sure that the president, who commands the biggest soapbox in the nation, is going to deploy it for health care, and he made it very clear that he is."
Republicans are nearly unanimously opposed to the legislation, and have made clear they intend to try to turn it to their advantage in midterm elections this fall in which 37 Senate seats and all 435 House seats are at stake.
The president wants legislation to expand health care to millions who lack it, crack down on insurance industry practices such as denial of benefits on the basis of pre-existing medical conditions and slow the growth of health care costs generally.
The president has told lawmakers he wants the tax on high-cost plans included in the legislation to help rein in costs. But that position courted conflict with labor leaders who fear exposing their membership to higher taxes, as well as with House Democrats who omitted it from the legislation they initially passed.
The day's events underscored the urgency with which the White House and top Democrats were working, and the tentative agreement on a new tax on high-cost plans was the most prominent fruit of the effort.
"This was a very critical issue that had to be resolved, and I think it has been," said Rep. Rob Andrews, D-N.J., who told reporters he had been briefed on the emerging agreement to impose a tax on costly insurance plans.
While not all details were set, it appeared the union leaders had backed down on their outright opposition to a new tax, and the White House had agreed to several concessions to mollify their concerns.
In a significant victory for unions, the 40 percent excise tax would not apply to policies covering workers in collective bargaining agreements, state and local workers and members of voluntary employee benefit associations through Dec. 31, 2017.
Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., and others said the tax would apply to fewer plans than was the case in the Senate-passed bill and would exclude the value of dental and vision coverage. They added it would provide an exemption for residents of states where the cost of health care is particularly high, as well as for employees of high-risk professions.
Courtney, who had led opposition to the tax, said he wanted to see final details before deciding whether he would support the agreement.
Union leaders told reporters on a conference call that the tentative agreement would raise the threshold on insurance policies subject to tax from $8,500 in the Senate-passed bill to $8,900 for singles and from $23,000 to $24,000 for family coverage. Even the new thresholds would be subject to adjustment if unexpected rises in health care occur by the time the plan is effective.
Additionally, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told reporters that beginning in 2017, all health plans – union and nonunion – would be permitted to seek coverage in insurance exchanges that would be set up under the bill to allow consumers to shop for coverage issued under federal regulations.
White House officials disputed that, saying the issue was not settled.
Originally, the tax included in the Senate bill was estimated to raise $149 billion through 2019. Trumka said the revisions would reduce that amount by $60 billion – money that negotiators would have to find elsewhere or else reduce the coverage in the legislation.
While the tax would be applied to high-cost plans, the Congressional Budget Office has said its principal impact would be to prompt consumers to purchase lower-value coverage. That, in turn, would raise the income tax they pay by reducing the deduction they can take for health care expenses.
Officials said the agreement was thrashed out over more than 15 hours of negotiating at the White House that ended after midnight Wednesday.
In an indication that lawmakers and the White House were driving for a swift agreement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., issued a statement pledging to have any final bill posted online for 72 hours before a vote is called.
A spokesman said the plan would require the Congressional Budget Office to issue a formal report on the bill's cost and coverage before the 72-hour clock began running.
Once a final compromise is reached, Democrats intend for a vote first in the House, then a final showdown in the Senate. There, Majority Leader Harry Reid will need to post a 60-vote majority to clear the way for final passage.
Republican opposition has been virtually unanimous in both houses – only Rep. Anh (Joseph) Cao of Louisiana among GOP lawmakers has voted for the bill – and there is not a vote to spare in the Senate.
There, Democrats have 58 votes; independents aligned with them hold two.

CHICAGO — Albertina Walker's singing once stopped the filming of a movie because so many actors were moved to tears by the "Queen of Gospel." At home in Chicago, she babied her beloved French poodles, wore rhinestone sunglasses and was a fixture at the city's gospel music festival.
The Grammy-winning singer died Friday at age 81 of respiratory failure at RML Specialty Hospital in Chicago, said her granddaughter, Tina Nance. Walker, a protege of Mahalia Jackson, formed her own gospel group, the Caravans, as a young woman. Later, she played the role of mentor to many young singers.
She also was the only grandparent Nance ever knew. In bits and pieces, Nance figured out as a girl that Walker wasn't her biological grandmother, but she never got a straight answer about it from Walker.
"She said to me, 'I am your grandmother. That's all you need to know,'" Nance told The Associated Press on Friday.
Taking young people under her wing started early for Walker. Delores Washington, 72, who joined the Caravans in 1958, said Walker was like a big sister, keeping her and the other younger singers out of trouble when they toured. They sang in churches and stayed in people's homes because segregation kept them out of many hotels, Washington recalled.
"There was name-calling. We'd have to go in through the back door (at restaurants) if we wanted something to eat," Washington said. "It came as a total shock to me. I was born in Illinois. I was not familiar with all this hostility toward black people" elsewhere.
Walker set an example by demanding respect with her demeanor.
"We held our heads up high and kept pushing," Washington said. "We were on a mission: To sing for God."
Agent and friend Sasha Daltonn said Walker stuck with gospel music even though she'd been encouraged to sing R&B during the 1960s and 1970s.
"She was revered in the gospel community because of her commitment to gospel, her distinctive style and her uncompromising faith in God," Daltonn said. "It wasn't about the money. It was about the message."
A foundation Walker started to help young people get formal musical training now gives away $10,000 a year, Nance said.
Nance remembered her grandmother wowing the cast of the Steve Martin movie "Leap of Faith" when she sang a solo for a scene. Nance, an extra in the 1992 movie, said filming stopped because so many of the actors were moved to tears.
"It was like the spirit of the Lord came into that place. They had to take a break because everyone was crying," Nance said. Later, Martin sent Walker a bouquet with a card that read, "You are truly the greatest gospel singer in the world," Nance said. Walker treasured the card because she admired Martin's comedy.
"One of our favorite movies was 'The Jerk,'" Nance said.
Pam Morris, a close friend of Walker's and WVON radio host, called Walker a "legend" who was responsible for launching more than a dozen gospel artists' careers.
U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush said in a statement that Walker was a voice for the civil rights movement whose music was "a healing balm to those who struggled for justice."
Walker, a lifelong Chicago resident, was a member of the West Point Baptist Church. Funeral arrangements are pending.

I am facially disfigured. The left side of my face and neck is empurpled and engorged by "veins gone wild" in the form of a congenital venous malformation. My appearance has been further distorted by multiple surgeries and radiation therapy. And I am tired of seeing people like me portrayed as evil in the movies. In the movie The Dark Knight, I watched Aaron Eckhart being transformed from a handsome and virtuous district attorney into a revenge-bound monster. How? Through the magic of facial disfigurement! I understand that movies are a visual medium, but what message does that deliver to a veteran with the side of his face blown off or burnt in combat? What does a child with a cleft lip think about herself when the Joker points to his scarred mouth to explain why he is a sociopath? The Lion King's adversary is named Scar. We conclude immediately that he is wicked. An iconic family movie thereby teaches young children that any facial difference, however small, will similarly identify them as evil. Every second of The Passion of the Christ was scrutinized for anti-Semitism. How could reviewers and audiences have completely overlooked the use of facially different children to portray the demons terrorizing Judas? This artistic shortcut is so trite as to be almost subliminal, so taken for granted that it is never questioned except in the hidden places of the heart where self-image is formed. The Phantom is defined by disfigurement and forced to live, hidden and fearful, in the dark. The moment you see the Phantom's mask, you know that his love of music and the incredible gifts he has brought to the world of opera are meaningless. Scars always trump talent when artistic vision is limited. Of course, romance is dangled before him and cruelly yanked away. The list of cinematic disfigured villains is long: Freddy Kreuger. Darth Vader. Scarface. Almost all of Dick Tracy's criminals. Quasimodo. Charlize Theron in Monster.
Yes, there are exceptions, like the saintly Elephant Man and the more fully realized Rocky Dennis in Mask. J.K.Rowling dealt creatively with Harry Potter's cute lightning "scar" in her books, including seeing it as a source of self-realization, but the movies missed or dodged that point. Face it. There is no cinematic metaphor more hackneyed or shallow. Time after time, the facially disfigured are shown as barely human, driven insane by deformity and ready to retaliate with mutilations or murder. Their highest motivation is revenge. Funny thing -- in my work as a performer and keynote speaker, I have met thousands of facially different people who bring astounding gifts to the world and who, in fact, radiate beauty. You know what? I've never met a single axe murderer! There is more at stake here than Hollywood's artistic laziness and lack of imagination.
For most of my life, I was very ashamed of my appearance. Paradoxically, I have found wholeness through, and with, what first seemed to be a grotesque flaw. Working through my fear and shame, I have come to discover that I am whole. My shadow side-my difficulty, my challenge-is on the outside, where I have been forced to deal with it. I do know what it is like to be out in the world feeling monstrous. Every time I walk out my front door, I deal with stares, comments and the occasional cruelty, even to the extent of having someone spit in my face. It is not the fact of my disfigurement that wears on my psyche. It is the fear and self-doubt of others. In fact, it is their worry about being rejected and abandoned, which they project onto me. That's one of the jobs of the visibly disabled, to carry the fears of others who then can pretend that they are normal. I have learned that my face is a gift. Not one that I was excited about, not at first. It is a gift because I have been forced to look inside to find my self worth. And that is exactly what everyone-not just the facially disfigured person-has to do to reach spiritual and emotional maturity. My favorite work is at middle schools, where my wife Marlena and I do a program titled Love at Second Sight, about appearance and acceptability. What else is more important to a 12 year old seeking to find a sense of self and a place in the world among his or her peers? Afterward, the children often confide in us about their self-perceived flaws and it is clear that in many cases, those perceptions have contributed to diminished self-image. It is not only children. The first time I gave a talk about facial difference, a very lovely woman came up to me, clasped my hand and said, "David, you are so courageous. It was terrible for me in school and, as a matter of fact, I am still very embarrassed and ashamed of my freckles." I looked down, thinking to myself, "Really! The heartbreak of freckles!" And yet I could see that her anxiety and implicit self-disparagement were real. Here is the crux of it: everyone has the fear of being in some way defective, unlovable and unacceptable to society. That is the true disfigurement. The place deep inside us where that fear lives is where predators come to feed. I submit that there is another way of looking at facial difference-one based on the truth of human experience. The artistic metaphor of a scarred face can be one of personal integration. Every person must reach the point of self acceptance. That magical moment is the key to living an integrated and full life. A person with facial difference can represent someone who has lived through that moment. My face is unique but my inner experiences are universal and very, very human.
So please, Hollywood, could we try for a little more imagination and creativity? An about face, perhaps? Don't make me get the chainsaw. Most Popular
