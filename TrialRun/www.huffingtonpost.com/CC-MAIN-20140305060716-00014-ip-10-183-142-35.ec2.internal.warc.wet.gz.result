Obama Borrows From the JFK Playbook on Ukraine
Stephen Schlesinger
Author and Fellow at the Century Foundation	President Obama appears to be using a strategic approach to the Ukrainian situation that is similar in many respects to that employed by his Democratic Party predecessor, President John F. Kennedy, in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. In both cases, the two leaders were dealing with secret, unexpected, armed missions launched by aggressive Russian leaders against Western interests, with little precedent in both cases on how to handle the crises. Obviously the Cuban missile affair was a far more perilous showdown than what is now happening in the Ukraine. The Cuban affair had doomsday-type consequences. The invasion of Crimea does not entail any possibility of nuclear exchanges between two nations. But in other respects, there are parallels for Obama.

We Were Attacked, But Will Not Be Silenced
Nadia Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina
When we arrived to visit a women's prison with our prison-reform organization, unknown men attacked us with blinding liquid. We believe the attack was sanctioned by the Russian Federal Security Service.
Comments (39) The Great U-Turn
Robert Reich
Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; author, 'Beyond Outrage'	Do you recall a time in America when the income of a single school teacher or baker or salesman or mechanic was enough to buy a home, have two cars, and raise a family? I remember.
Comments (51) Let's Fix a Justice System That Isn't Working
Harry Belafonte
Entertainer & Activist	There is a crisis that demands our urgent attention. For the last four decades, this country has been obsessed with expanding the number of people we throw behind bars and the length of time we hold them there.
Comments (25) Who Creates Drama at HBO? Very Few Women or People of Color
Maureen Ryan
TV critic, The Huffington Post	It might be useful to take a break from talking about what individual dramas are doing and talk instead about what HBO -- and other critically acclaimed TV outlets -- are not doing.
Comments (443) Businesses Should Stand Up to Climate Change Deniers
Richard Branson
Founder, Virgin Group	More businesses should be following Apple's stance in encouraging more investment in sustainability. While Tim Cook told sustainability skeptics to "get out of our stock," I would urge climate change deniers to get out of our way.
Comments (50) When Your Body Says 'No More Screens'
Lori Leibovich
Executive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post	It hurts to do my job, lift my daughter, carry grocery bags, or make it through the day without popping Advils. The message my body is sending is clear: Stop typing, tapping and scrolling, now.
Comments There's No Need to End Saturday Mail Delivery
Sen. Bernie Sanders
Independent U.S. Senator from Vermont	The Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, public education or the Postal Service.
Comments (122) I'm a Footballer Who Happens to Wear Hijab -- I Didn't Need FIFA to Tell Me That
Shireen Ahmed
Writer and advocate focusing on Muslim women in sports	How can I laud FIFA for striking down a law that should have never been implemented in the first place? Being ripped from the game because a lot of white, privileged men decided it was dangerous for me and the sport was torturous. Football is for all of us. It should always have been.
Comments (13) Would You Wish Your Life on Your Children?
Robin Kevles-Necowitz
Licensed professional counselor and parenting coach	Childhood isn't easy. And it's a whole lot harder when parents are counting on their children to make them happy -- with a good grade, a positive attitude, a full social calendar, a home run at the game, a scholarship, great SAT scores and perfect attendance.
Comments The Truth About Chipotle's New Vegetarian Option
Emily Cohn
Editor, HuffPost Business	It didn't take me long to realize what Chipotle was really doing by adding tofu (aka Sofritas) to its menu: It had cleverly devised a way to get vegetarians to pay more for a meatless burrito. Now, vegetarians can spend just as much as omnivores.
Comments (44) Advice for Everyone Under Age 90 (From a 90-Year-Old)
Larry Crandell
Volunteer & Raconteur	I'm older than Scotch tape. And it was invented in 1930. I've lived through the Great Depression and served in the Army Air Corps in World War II. At 90 and ¾, I only date women who like antiques.
Comments (23) Will Crimea Save NATO? Not So Fast
Sean Kay
Sean Kay is Robson Professor of Politics at Ohio Wesleyan University	As significant as Crimea is, there are no solutions to either Ukraine -- or North Korea, Afghanistan, Syria, and Iran -- that do not involve the Russians, as unappetizing as that might be. We face tough choices that can only be answered with a wider set of interests at play.
Comments Learning to Love My Unemployed Self
Katie Gibson
Freelance radio producer and audio editor	I had everything. I had the perfect apartment, the perfect lifestyle (whatever that even means), the perfect husband, the perfect dog, the perfect job. I was bouncy lollipops and rainbows happy. That is, until it all fell apart faster than you can say downsizing.
Comments A Mother at Mothers and Sons
Tovah Feldshuh
Actress	Mothers and Sons, refreshingly imagines a world that the backyard barbecue guests of my childhood could probably never have imagined
Comments Pass Comprehensive Immigration Reform to Help Immigrant Victims of Violence
Rep. Gwen Moore
U.S. Representative for Wisconsin's 4th Congressional District	Comprehensive immigration reform would lift millions of immigrants out of the shadows, reducing women's vulnerability to abuse and exploitation and eliminating one of the major barriers to seeking assistance. Further, many women would no longer have to make the heart-wrenching decision to stay in an abusive situation out of fear of being torn apart from their families.
Comments Marijuana Taxes in Colorado -- An Early Clue
Pat Oglesby
Lawyer; Former Congressional tax staffer	Across America, lawmakers are eyeing tax revenue from legalized marijuana. In a few days, the Colorado Department of Revenue is due to report how much marijuana tax was paid there for January, the first full month of recreational sales anywhere ever.
Comments The Pentagon's Phony Budget War
Mattea Kramer
Research director, National Priorities Project	Despite cries of doom since the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration surfaced in Washington in 2011, the Pentagon has seen few actual reductions, and there is no indication that will change any time soon.
Comments Could Yoga Be the Secret to Motivating Millennials?
Michael Anthony Fernandez
Founder, Factory 360	Would you ever think that Courtney Love would be the inspiration for restructuring an entire office culture -- which included building a yoga studio in our new office? Well, she was, and this is what happened.
Comments Why Being My Brother's Keeper Matters
Gov. Deval Patrick
Governor, Massachusetts	As a black man, my heart aches over the disproportionate numbers of men and boys of color left back by schools, left out of jobs and caught up in crime. As a black public official, I am struck by how little appetite there seems to be among law makers to deal with the root causes of this.
Comments (14) Paul Ryan Is a Charlatan, Not a Serious 'Policy Wonk'
Peter Dreier
E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental College	For too long, reporters have been bamboozled by Ryan, who claims to be a both a budget expert and something of a social philosopher. But he's just a slick talker who appears to have flunked basic math in high school or college, because his budget numbers never add up.
Comments (34) The 10 Worst Pieces of Advice From Susan Patton's 'Marry Smart'
Claire Fallon
Books Editor, The Huffington Post	Here are the 10 worst pieces of dating advice from Marry Smart -- and trust me, there was plenty of bad advice from which to choose.
Comments (37) 10 Reasons I'm a Funeral Director
Caleb Wilde
Sixth generation licensed funeral director	Perhaps there's no greater freedom than to live life with a healthy relationship with death. That healthy relationship allows you embracing each moment, realizing that we are not promised tomorrow. This good relationship with death has been given to me by the funeral profession.
Comments Why Washington Doesn't Want to Leave Afghanistan
Tom Engelhardt
Editor, TomDispatch.com	Washington and Kabul have, for endless months, been performing a strange pas de deux over the issue of American withdrawal. The less Karzai complied, the more Obama administration and Pentagon officials betrayed an overwhelming need to stay.
Comments On a Random Day in the U.S. There Are More Than 66,000 Requests for Help Escaping Domestic Violence
Soraya Chemaly
Feminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that order	The dynamics of domestic violence are complex and changing them requires not just one thing to change, but many things simultaneously.
Comments Understanding CBO's Minimum-Wage Report
Scott Lilly
Senior fellow, Center for American Progress	As the uproar over the CBO analysis demonstrates, the issue of whether jobs are gained or lost as a result of a minimum-wage increase depends largely on how we analyze the vast amount of research that has been conducted on the question over the past half-century.
Comments How Netflix Is Ruining My Relationship (And Might Be Ruining Yours)
Zoë Triska
Senior Books Editor, The Huffington Post	What's not so nice? Having to wait for said person you love in order to watch the rest of the fully-released season. Here are the worst things for me about watching a show with my beloved.
Comments Why Proponents of Raising the NBA Age Minimum Are Full of Beans
Jonathan Weiler
Director of Undergraduate Studies in Global Studies, UNC Chapel Hill	The NBA's owners may sincerely believe that they will be improving the overall product if they start barring players under 20. But they will be sincerely mistaken.
Comments In Defense Of Adverbs
Maddie Crum
Books Editor, The Huffington Post	This forceful call for more forceful writing is misguided; adverbs can be phonetically pleasing, can imbue sentences with subtlety, and should not be entirely shunned.
Comments CSW58 -- Imagining a Different World for Women
Cheryl Saban Ph.D.
Author and advocate for women and children	The status of the world's women will be discussed in depth during the upcoming CSW58 in New York City. The Commission of the Status of Women is arguably the highest authority on issues of gender equality and the empowerment of women at the global level.
Comments 5 Ways Your Social Media Sharing Habit Can Put You At Risk
Adam Levin
Former Director New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs; Chairman of Credit.com and Identity Theft 911	The amount that we share online makes us more likely to feel like sharing widely is a normal thing, online and off. But the ease with which we publicize seemingly harmless bits of personal information online and off is often what scam artists rely upon when they go phishing.

Jay-Z's "Magna Carta Holy Grail": it's not pop?
-- Jay-Z, "Magna Carta Holy Grail" (Roc Nation/Universal)
Kanye didn't care about satisfying radio with his latest album.
Neither does Jay-Z.
"Magna Carta Holy Grail," the rapper's 12th album, doesn't have the pop or mainstream appeal his past records have offered. The 16-track set, mostly helmed by Timbaland, is full of robust and moody hip-hop beats that maintain a nice groove, but don't expect any booming anthems or party jams here. Like Kanye, there isn't a single or music video ahead of the album's release, which comes out officially on Sunday though up to 1 million Samsung mobile phone users were able to download the album for free on July Fourth.
With the exception of rapping about fatherhood and infant daughter Blue Ivy, lyrically, "Magna Carta" doesn't tell us anything new about the superstar. We all know how he rose from selling drugs in the Brooklyn projects to become arguably the most important rapper of all-time, his multiplatinum feats, his awards, and the benefits of having a superstar wife – Beyonce – at his side.
But while Jay-Z continues to make headlines away from music, this album treads familiar ground, which makes the album – dare we say it? – average.
He'll remind you – a couple times – that Samsung bought 1 million copies of the record and gave it away three days early – on songs like "Somewhere In America." There's similar flavor lyrically on "Tom Ford," with its freaky beats, and the bumping "Picasso Baby," where Beyonce gets a shout-out: "Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa, the modern version, with better features."
It's when he talks about the other lady in his life, his 1-year-old daughter, where we see a rare side of the typically braggadocio rapper.
"Now I got tattoos on my body, psycho (expletive) in my lobby, I got haters in the paper, photos shoots with paparazzi, can't even take my daughter for a walk," he raps on "Holy Grail," a collaboration with Justin Timberlake. It's revealing, and especially special coming from the often-unfazed Jay-Z.
While Timberlake works well with Hova, his collaborations with Beyonce and Frank Ocean on "Part II (On the Run)" and "Ocean" rely too much on the R&B singers. There are other big names on the album, like Rick Ross, Pharrell and Nas, but "Magna Carta," it isn't designed like albums in the past. There are no catchy hooks to grab you in. The most excitement about the album hasn't been generated from the music, but it's promotion plan – Jay-Z announced the album in a commercial during the NBA Finals and launched a series of videos explaining the recording process and songs. He's continuing to create new blueprints to debut his music. That should be congratulated, but the songs on "Magna Carta" don't boom like his business plan.
"Knock me to my knees about a million times, uncle said I'll never sell a million records, I sold a million records like a million times," he raps on "Crown."
Yes, you've defied the odds, but we want a little more from the king.
