These days, there is a near-unanimous belief among western regulators that one way to prevent a repeat of the 2007-08 crisis is to stop banks taking crazy risks with subprime mortgage bonds or complex instruments such as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs).

G20 regulators are holding regular meetings in Basel to draw up rules on how banks should do this, as part of a wider reform of financial regulation.

Alison Rose Levy: Connecting the Dots: Osama and the Hijacking of New York's Grief
To anyone who has bought into all of these symbols, I have one thing to say. If you want to honor the 9/11 tragedy, forget about symbols and remember real human beings. More death and killing won't help. Jonathan D. Fitzgerald: Osama Bin Laden at the Nexus of God and Man's Justice
If we could accomplish God's justice by killing people, Jesus would not have come to die, but to kill. But that's not how God's justice works. Fr. Peter-Michael Preble: Osama is Dead. Now What Should I Feel?
What is a Christian to do? How are we to respond to this? We need to keep all of this in the proper perspective, be happy that justice has been done, but we cannot rejoice in the death of anyone. Around the Web:

STOCKHOLM -- LM Ericsson and Sony Corp. announced Thursday they will go separate ways as Ericsson sells its 50 percent stake in mobile phone maker Sony Ericsson to Sony for euro1.05 billion ($1.46 billion).
Sony Ericsson will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony and integrated into Sony's platform of network-connected consumer electronics products, the Japanese company and Swedish wireless equipment firm said.
The transaction gives Sony an opportunity to integrate smartphones with consumer electronics devices, such as tablets, televisions and personal computers, the companies said.
The move was widely anticipated by analysts, who have argued Sony Ericsson could become more competitive in the tough smartphone market under sole Sony ownership.
Shares in Ericsson rose by 5.1 percent to 70.1 kroner ($10.7) in early Stockholm trading, while Sony stock climbed 5.4 percent to 1.65 yen ($21.7) before closing in Tokyo.
"I believe this improves the outlook for Sony Ericsson, because Sony can take full responsibility for the company and use the unique things that they have," said Greger Johansson, an analyst with research firm Redeye. "The opportunity to integrate the phones with their other products improves."
Johansson said the smartphone market is "extremely tough" and Sony Ericsson's competitors are also developing quickly.
He said the price Ericsson received wasn't great, but it will be a relief for the Swedish company to be able to focus on its core wireless equipment business and offload the mobile phone maker that has taken up a lot of management time.
"Sony Ericsson has no strategic value for Ericsson anymore," added Helena Nordman-Knutson, an analyst with Ohman Fondkommission in Stockholm.
Ericsson and Sony combined their unprofitable handset ventures into the joint venture Sony Ericsson in 2001 and enjoyed some early successes with its Walkman and Cyber-shot phones.
In recent years it has suffered from the competitive climate in the smartphone market and earlier this month it posted a break-even third quarter result.
The company adopted Google's Android operating system for its smartphones in 2008, and has said it now controls about 11 percent of the Android-based smartphone market. Its Android-based Xperia smartphones account for more than 80 percent of its sales.
Thursday's deal will provide Sony with an intellectual property cross-licensing agreement, covering all products and services of Sony as well as ownership of five essential patent families relating to wireless handset technology.
"We can more rapidly and more widely offer consumers smartphones, laptops, tablets and televisions that seamlessly connect with one another and open up new worlds of online entertainment," Sony CEO, Sir Howard Stringer said, adding this includes Sony's PlayStation Network and its online provider of music, games and video, Sony Entertainment Network.
Stringer called the deal "the last piece of the puzzle" for Sony's portfolio of entertainment products, including movies, television and music and said it's no coincidence the deal was announced in the same month as the launch of the Sony Entertainment network.
He acknowledged the agreement was partly motivated by the tough competition in smart phone market.
"While we do have catching up to do, we have a lot of things to add to this phone," Stringer said. "The television or whatever that we can make for this phone and other Sony devices is the beginning of something I think is quite magical."
Stringer said the brand name of the mobile phones would probably change in the future but will remain as Sony Ericsson in the short-term. He added the acquisition will afford Sony operational efficiencies in engineering, network development and marketing.
The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, but has been approved by appropriate decision-making bodies of both companies.
Ericsson said the shift in the mobile market, from simple mobile phones to smartphones that include access to internet services and content, means the synergies for the company in having both a telecoms services portfolio and a handset operation have decreased.
"Ten years ago when we formed the joint venture, thereby combining Sony's consumer products knowledge with Ericsson's telecommunication technology expertise, it was a perfect match to drive the development of feature phones. Today we take an equally logical step as Sony acquires our stake in Sony Ericsson and makes it a part of its broad range of consumer devices," said Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg.
Ericsson said it will now focus on the global wireless market as a whole and how wireless connectivity can benefit people, business and society beyond just phones.
Ericsson and Sony will also set up a wireless connectivity initiative aimed at driving and developing the market's adoption of connectivity across multiple platforms, they said.
The agreement is expected to close in January 2012.

So what's next from the Hollywood dream factory? Perhaps another wedding comedy featuring a zany bridal party? Or a found footage horror film that clearly wasn't found? Here are five movies we can probably expect to see in the near future:

Arts News
Toronto artist Ryan Enn Hughes has created a mesmerizing series that could force many to rethink the possibilities of animated GIFs.
For the project, dubbed "Sparkler$," Hughes enlisted four subjects to jump up and down while "painting" with sparklers. All the while, Hughes took photographs with a DSLR camera on an eight-second exposure. The photos were then mastered at 5,000 pixels.
Hughes says he and his team probably burnt 200 sparklers during shooting process, which was completed over the course of one day.
With both a background in photography and filmmaking, Hughes is invested in the future of animated GIFs.
"Photographers have an eye that is extremely well-developed, particularly with their sense of lighting and capturing a single moment. But for me, I want to do more than just make a still image," Hughes told The Huffington Post in a telephone interview. "I think the whole concept of having a moving photograph is going to expand even more in the coming years."
Can't get enough of Ryan Enn Hughes exploration of moving and still images? Check out his 360 project, which The Huffington Post covered last year. Check out Ryan Enn Hughes Sparkler$ project below and the behind the scenes video.
