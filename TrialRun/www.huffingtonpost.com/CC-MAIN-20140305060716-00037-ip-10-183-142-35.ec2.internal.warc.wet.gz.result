A small but dedicated group of New York University students, graduates and their supporters came out to take a stance against student debt in an event called Casualties of Debt on Wednesday.
The demonstration, which was hosted by MTV's Andrew Jenks and NYU Local editor-in-chief Charlie Eisenhood, was designed to raise awareness for the debt crisis at NYU, where students owe a collective $659 million -- an average of $35,000 each upon graduation, which is around $11,000 higher than the national average.
After a number of people had gathered, Jenks instructed students to write the amount of debt they will have accrued once they leave NYU on white T-shirts with red dollar signs distributed by volunteers and stand still for a moment. "The point is to show that young people care," Jenks said. "People say that we don't give a shit, and it's an easy out. And so this is a starting step for all of us to try to make a difference. Call it cheesy, call it hokey, call it inane, call it silly, call it whatever you want, but we care and that's a starting point for me." Sporting their shirts and blank-faced masks, the students stood for a moment of silence in an area bound by two American flags.
Though the problem of excessive debt is especially relevant at NYU, Jenks says that the issue is widespread -- and that he hopes the NYU protest will serve as a prototype for schools nationwide. "It's not just about NYU. It's about the college system in the U.S., and how you can make it better," said Jenks. He added, "Obama said that higher education is the pathway to success. If a good education is a prerequisite for success, [that means] a prerequisite for success is a $24,000 loan." For the freshman and sophomores in attendance, the payment date remains far enough in the future to still feel theoretical -- but the effects of the stress are real. Sophomores Andrew Olshevski and Susu Harmache both said they feel guilty for putting such a heavy financial burden on their families, and freshman Annie Utley said that the high tuition had a "definitely put a strain" on her relationship with her father, who works weekends to help defray the immense cost of her education. And for older students, that looming debt is starting to feel real. Junior Bridget Moschetti said that her debt will be $220,000 upon graduation, not factoring in commuting costs. When asked what she hoped would come of the demonstration, Moschetti said she would like for tuition would go down -- "but it's not going to happen." And when asked to describe a best-case scenario, she said that NYU's good name would propel her into a career lucrative enough to pay off the massive debt. Kristina Ensminger had similar hopes when she enrolled at NYU's journalism school, but was disappointed when the prestigious degree failed to deliver. "I knew that I would be in debt, but I guess I thought the earning potential would be greater," she said.
Ensminger earned her bachelor's degree from UC-Santa Barbara, where she also graduated with debt -- but only 1/3 of what she accrued at NYU. This discrepancy begs the question of agency in students' decisions of where to enroll. Debt is certainly a pervasive problem, but NYU's tuition is notoriously high, and students who choose to attend should have this in mind. When asked whether or not he thought students must claim some responsibility for the financial consequences of their choices, Eisenhood countered with some questions of his own: "Can you make what amounts to a massive financial decision at 18? Do you have all of the information?" According to him, the answer is no. "The government and universities don't do enough [to inform students]...people know, but it's still not fair... a conversation needs to start here," he said.
And students hope that their presence at the demonstration will help get that conversation started. As freshman Angela Almeida said, "It's cumulative. Maybe 100 people are here now, but in six months, maybe it'll be 200." Are you in debt? Share your story in the comments section below. FOLLOW HUFFPOST COLLEGE

On September 11th, 2001, Americans solemnly vowed to hunt down arch-terrorist Osama bin Laden. Today, closure: One of the most popular search terms on Google is "bin laden porn." Journalists flocked to Twitter to make bin Laden self-abuse jokes and betrayed their encyclopedic knowledge of adult cinema. The last time anyone paid this much attention to something named Kohl there was a 30 percent markdown on home appliances. And guess who gets your cash when you tip a hot dog vendor at Yankee stadium? Not just the guy who paints Alex Rodriguez's centaur portraits, but also Goldman Sachs and the Dallas Cowboys. This is HUFFPOST HILL for Friday, May 13th, 2011: SENATE LIKELY TO VOTE ON RYAN BUDGET - Harry Reid's neverending quest to humiliate Senate Republicans rolls on. Like that time your cool new friends from college visited and your mom gabbed on about what a nerd you were in high school, Senate Democrats will attempt to highlight the GOP moderates' distance from their own party by forcing a vote on Paul Ryan's hyper-conservative budget. A leadership aide tells Josiah Ryan that that the bill will likely come to a vote next week. Mitch McConnell has threatened to force a vote on President Obama's original budget proposal in retaliation, as this Congress continues its twin focus on not passing anything while making stupid points. We tried to reach an adult for comment but none could be found [The Hill]
Next Thursday will be Katie Couric's last day at "Evening News," Michael Calderone reports.
Sam Stein is reporting that cranky corporate consultants who live off the national party teat aren't looking forward to Russ Feingold's potential Wisconsin Senate bid. He'll say it in much nicer terms than that. Story posting soon.
PARANOID SELF-LOATHING GOP LOBBYIST TICKLED PINK BY LANNY DAVIS' HURT FEELINGS - Our favorite PSLGOPL is absolutely thrilled that Lanny Davis can't stand Garry Trudeau correctly pointing out that Davis took money from a murderous dictator. "It's the moral left versus the business left. I love the fight! They should keep doing it," wrote PSLGOPL. "You're more self-loathing than I could ever hope to be." Thanks, PSLGOPL!
The best part of the spat is that Garry Trudeau cc'ed Politico's Chris Frates with his reply to Davis, which wound up in today's Politico Influence. [politico] DAILY DELANEY DOWNER - A standoff between Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly and Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue has halted unemployment insurance for 37,000 jobless in the state. Both sides keep saying they want to restore the benefits, but no apparent progress has been made since Perdue vetoed a Republican bill because it attached the benefits to double-digit budget cuts. The legislature is set to adjourn early in June. Charlotte's John Allison, 37, told HuffPost the stalemate reminds him of a game of chicken, except "the person controlling the car's not even in it. It's a remote control game of chicken and I'm tied in the seat." [HuffPost]
MERKLEY TO OCC: YOU SUCK - The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency was offended that Sen. Jeff Merkley said banks would face no consequences for disobeying its orders to quit abusing homeowners. The OCC insisted that, in fact, banks would face penalties of $1 million a day. In response, Merkley's office sent an OCC beatdown from Diane Thompson of the National Consumer Law Center. A sampling: "The orders are time-limited and only apply in terms of reimbursement to homeowners to violations occurring between 2009 and 2010. Homeowners by the terms of these orders receive no protection for violations occurring before the time period or afterwards, even if they lost their home at foreclosure," Thompson wrote. "The orders do not provide any meaningful mechanism for enforcement. They leave all enforcement in the hands of the OCC, and agency that has a spotty record of consumer protection, at best." Don't be bashful: Send tips/stories/photos/events/fundraisers/job movement/juicy miscellanea to huffposthill@huffingtonpost.com. Follow us on Twitter - @HuffPostHill HERB KOHL TO RETIRE, SENATE LOSES ITS RESIDENT 'OH YEAH, THAT GUY' - Wisconsin Senator Herb Kohl will retire at the end of his current term. Kohl made the announcement today outside of his Milwaukee district office. "I've always believed it is better to leave a job a little too early than a little too late," Kohl said. "The interest and energy I had for this job will find a new home." You might remember Kohl as...actually, no, you won't remember Kohl. [WaPo]
SPECULATION TIME! BALDWIN IN, NO WORD FROM FEINGOLD OR RYAN - Reports almost immediately emerged that Rep. Tammy Baldwin will enter the first open Senate election in Wisconsin in 23 years. Meanwhile, prognosticators' heads brimmed with images of an Alien Vs. Predator-style political showdown between activist-darling Russ Feingold and fans-of-dudes-who-look-like-extras-from-South-Pacific-darling Paul Ryan. Liberals have been pining for Feingold's return to politics after his upset loss to Ron Johnson in the midterms and conservatives view Ryan as a young Newt Gingrich if young Newt Gingrich spent less time abandoning sick women to whom he'd committed his life and more time condensing the Chicago School into nifty soundbites. Both Feingold and Ryan commented on Kohl's announcement but didn't offer any hint as to whether they will enter the race. In a likely accidental snub of Baldwin's quick entry, Ryan told reporters this morning that he won't comment today. "We didn't see it coming," he said. "Right now, this is Herb Kohl's day and we should thank Herb for his service, and I just want to stick with that." [Roll Call]
RON PAUL OFFICIALLY LAUNCHES PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN - Ron Paul launched his White House bid today in an appearance on "Good Morning America" and later elaborated on his platform and objectives at a rally in Exeter, New Hampshire. "The people are agreeing with much I have been saying for 30 years," Paul said during the GMA hit. "The time is right." At his Exeter event, Paul served up some of that patented, stirring libertarian oratory that sounds like the mix of a Marxist rebel and Tony Robbins. "The revolution is spreading, and the momentum is building," he said to a rapt audience. "Our time has come." RELOVEUTION, PEOPLE [LA Times]
HUCKABEE TO MAKE AN 'ANNOUNCEMENT,' AIDE THINKS HE ISN'T RUNNING - The former Arkansas governor and friendliest man to ever inform you that you're going to hell for being gay told his supporters to expect a major announcement on his future during his Fox News program this Sunday. Ed Rollins, a longtime Huckabee advisor, told the Wall Street Journal that he suspects the news means there won't be a campaign. "I've heard nothing, which indicates to me he's not running," Rollins said. Rollins said that as recently as a week ago, Huckabee was "fully engaged" but then "he started backing off, but he still wanted to go through, could he raise the money, could he put together the operatives." Rollins added that Huckabee's inner circle believed that Huckabee could do so. [WSJ]
The other reason he's probably announcing he's not running: Using your TV show to officially launch your campaign would brush up against all kinds of election laws.
WHITE HOUSE REACTS TO MITT ROMNEY'S DEFENSE OF ITS POLICIES - Yesterday former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney made a big splash by saying nice things about a bill he helped pass that was basically to the Affordable Care Act what The Honeymooners were to The Flintstones. He also said nice things about France. It was a lovely speech. At an off-camera briefing today, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney didn't make much of an effort to throw water on the media firestorm."We have said before that health care reform that then Governor Romney signed into law in Massachusetts is in many ways similar to the legislation that resulted in the Affordable Care Act," he said. "We wholly endorse flexibility and we obviously feel that Massachusetts took a smart approach towards health care reform," the press secretary added. "Its provenance was so mainstream, there are great similarities between Massachusetts' law, the Affordable Care Act and legislation proposed by then Rhode Island Republican [Senator] John Chaffee in 1993." Nice touch throwing in the former Republican who refused to vote for George W. Bush in 2004. [Sam Stein]
Matt Laslo interviewed NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen who insists NATO doesn't kill individuals, despite the repeated attacks on Gaddafi. "We do not target individuals," the Danish official said. "We are targeting military facilities including command and control centers." Uh huh. [The Atlantic] GEORGE W. BUSH RESPONDED TO BIN LADEN'S DEATH EXACTLY HOW YOU THINK HE WOULD - At a conference in Las Vegas for hedge fund managers -- naturally -- former President George W. Bush discussed for the first time how he learned of Osama bin Laden's death. "I was eating souffle at Rise Restaurant with Laura and two buddies," Bush said, "I excused myself and went home to take the call ... Obama simply said 'Osama Bin Laden is dead.'" Bush's response was classic Bush: "Good call." "The guy is dead. That is good," he continued. "Osama's death is a great victory in the war on terror. He was held up as a leader." Mission Accomplished actually didn't take any credit for the mission, instead praising the actions of the intelligence community. "The intelligence services deserve a lot of credit. They built a mosaic of information, piece by piece," he said. [ABC News]
@msbellows: Motto of restaurant where Bush was eating souffle when BHO got OBL? "How much more French can you get." http://bit.ly/lEcDTL OSAMA'S GOOGLE PROBLEM: So apparently bin Laden had a cache of ... porn. " A stash of pornography was found in the hideout of Osama bin Laden by the U.S. commandos who killed him, current and former U.S. officials said on Friday.The pornography recovered in bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, consists of modern, electronically recorded video and is fairly extensive, according to the officials, who discussed the discovery with Reuters on condition of anonymity." Who has a porn collection these days? Did he also have a box of Zeppelin bootleg cassettes? What year is it?! [Reuters]
What has Osama bin Watchin'?

OUCH - At Yankee Stadium, the concessionaire co-owned by the New York Yankees, the Dallas Cowboys, and Goldman Sachs allegedly pockets the 20 percent service fee attached to food and drink in violation of New York law, according to a class-action lawsuit filed against the company by three Yankee Stadium servers this week.

KEVIN THE INTERN'S 'THIS DAY IN HISTORY' - May 13th, 1846: U.S. Declares War on Mexico For Getting In the Way : Texas was an independent state, but both the U.S. and Mexico claimed it was theirs, arguing over the Nueces versus the Rio Grande River as its border. President Tyler got the Treaty of Annexation passed in Congress in 1845, and Texas joined the Union. President Polk then sent Taylor's army across the river to take the rest of the territory, and Mexico crossed the Rio Grande to retaliate. Congress then declared war at the request of Polk. After two years of fighting, Mexico gave up California and New Mexico for $15 million with a settlement of all U.S. claims, and Texas gained the Rio Grande as its border. A true bargain for two new states and a healthy serving of imperialism. Thanks, KB!

Those of you, dear readers, who are not used to the kind of mendacity practiced in the heartland of America must think the headlines of the past several days border on the absurd. If the governor of Illinois indeed is found guilty as charged, not only of seeking a payoff in exchange for an appointment to fill Barack Obama's vacated seat in the U.S. Senate, he could be convicted not only of a felony, but also of unmitigated chutzpah.
Having spent several years as a reporter during the years of the Daley machine in Chicago of the 1960s and 1970s, the news of corruption from downstate Illinois comes as no great shock to me. Governor Rod R. Blagojevich just happens to be the latest creep in a long line of them to occupy the governor's mansion in the last few decades.
However, it's not the world of politics that is enough to turn anyone's stomach so much these days as are the occupants in the world of sports, i.e. principally baseball. Don't get me wrong. I love our national sport. I have loved it from the Depression-era days when I grew up in the Bronx and adored the Yankees, probably because they were the only winners in an era of hard times. Yet, to pick up the morning newspaper and read about the $161 million dollar deal the Yankees signed with a pitcher who has never even won 20 games in a single season exceeds the bizarre, especially when the nation is enduring one of its worst economic crisis in decades. I don't know CC Sabathia or his blood-sucking agent. But they and all the other high-priced players and the teams that sign lucrative contracts in the months before spring training ought to feel a sense of embarrassment for their insensitivity at a time when tens of thousands of Americans have lost their jobs and their homes. Compare their plight to the good fortune of those who only can run, hit and field a ball. Guess who truly is out of touch with reality? It may only occur to the players and their owners when the baseball season opens next spring and the box seats, parking lots and hot dog stands are half-empty. But then again, who knows? Baseball fans are uncommonly forgiving. They can drown their sorrows, regrets and anger once the umpire barks, "Play Ball!." Most Popular

Introduction:
If this night is great for Republicans and a nightmare for Democrats, then those headlines were written weeks, if not months, in advance. The mid-point of expectations is that Democrats will lose seats in the Senate but will maintain their majority by one to three seats, lose enough seats to give Republicans control of the House of Representatives and get shellacked in governors races while also losing control of many state legislatures. This, sadly for Democrats, is the scenario we will call "On Trend."
We will call the best scenario for Democrats the "Blue Escape", which is anything that involves retaining control of both sides of Capitol Hill, which really means holding onto control of the House of Representatives -- even by a single seat. It wouldn't hurt to win a few more than half of the too-close-to-call senate and gubernatorial races, but if you are a Democrat holding on to hope as long as possible, keep your eye on the House races unless and until the networks call control of the House. If this happens fairly early, say before 10:30 EDT or so, you may not want to stay up late. Read on and we will tell you what to watch to know if this will happen before the networks make their calls.
The best Republican scenario, "Red Wave" is anything that involves taking control of the Senate, or racking up truly historic gains in the House (beyond 50 to a 60 or 70 seat gain). We will get some evidence of whether this type of wave really did materialize for Republicans in the House fairly early, but any realistic hope for Republicans to win control of the Senate will only come quite late, likely needing victories in some or all of the western states' Senate races in Nevada, California, Washington and Alaska.
The CenteredPolitics Hour-by-Hour Guide will keep your attention tuned to the races that will determine which of these scenarios rule the evening (and perhaps the next morning -- and perhaps several following days as late votes are counted, or re-counted, and the efforts to spin continue.)
We will keep our eye on about half of the 37 Senate seats up for election. It would be a major surprise if Democrats lose any of their 6 solid seats including Hawaii, Maryland, Oregon, Vermont, and two seats in New York. We can put Delaware in this category as well with Christine O'Donnell as the Republican nominee. Keeping those 7 seats would assure the Democrats at least 47 seats, three short of the number they need (50 with the Vice President as tie breaking vote) heading into Election Night.
The Republicans only have 23 seats that are not up for election in 2010. In addition there are 12 solid Republican seats: Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota and Utah. Adding these together, Republicans start the evening with 35 seats and needing to win 16 of the 18 remaining seats to get to 51 seats and control of the Senate in January (without any party switching going on).
The 18 Senate races to watch sorted by poll closing times with links to the latest polls from Pollster:
(Republicans need 16, Democrats need just 3 -- all times EDT):
6:00 Kentucky*, Indiana*
7:00 Florida*, New Hampshire*
7:30 West Virginia, Ohio
8:00 Connecticut, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania
8:30 Arkansas
9:00 Colorado, Wisconsin, Louisiana
10:00 Nevada
11:00 California, Washington*,
12:00 Alaska
*Polls close at different times throughout the state, so the time listed is the first time when a majority of polls in the state will be closed -- this is the earliest time a network might choose to call a race.
The unbolded seats in the list above are most likely to come in for the Republicans, but even if they all fall into line, Democrats just need to win 3 of the 9 bolded contests to deny GOP a majority in the Senate.
We will also be following key races needed for control of the House of Representatives. While all of the seats in the House are up for election, there are about 70 seats that are truly going to decide control of the chamber. Watch these races closely, especially the ones that close early in the evening, in order to predict the outcome at the end of the night when all of the votes have been counted. These 70 races are detailed in the hour by hour guide below.
Finally, 37 of the 50 states will be holding gubernatorial elections as well and 13 of these are the most competitive.
The thirteen key Governors races sorted by poll closing times (EDT) with links to the latest polls from Pollster:
7:00 Florida*, Vermont, Georgia
7:30 Ohio
8:00 Maryland, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Maine, Illinois
9:00 Rhode Island, Wisconsin
11:00 California, Oregon*
So go get whatever you're drinking and some crudités from the buffet and get ready for a long evening. Here is the first installment of the CenteredPolitics.com Hour by Hour Guide to Election Night 2010.
6:00 PM Polls close in most of Indiana and just over half of Kentucky. The other parts of both states are in the Central Time Zone and their polls will close at 7 PM EDT, but if one candidate is doing well enough against their projections, the networks could make a call in the Kentucky Senate race as early as 6:00 PM.
Senate: The first big race to watch of the evening is the race for Jim Bunning's seat that pits Rand Paul (R, son of Ron Paul, a Tea Party and libertarian favorite) against Jack Conway (D, State Attorney General). Paul had some early stumbles, particularly over his views on the 1964 Civil Rights Act, but the latest polls put him well ahead. Kentucky Democrats and the progressive blogosphere hope Paul will suffer a late slide due to an incident where Tim Profitt, a volunteer Paul Campaign Coordinator assaulted Lauren Valle, a MoveOn.org activist outside a recent debate. A close race and a slow decision would be good signs for Democrats. Kentucky is one of the 18 states Republicans need to get 16 from, so an unlikely Conway win would by itself almost completely derail the Red Wave scenario.
House:
D -- R
__ __ KY-6: The first House race to watch of the night pits Ben Chandler (D) trying to hang onto his seat versus Garland Barr (R). Chandler voted for the Recovery Act and against healthcare reform. Chandler is polling slightly ahead in a close race.
