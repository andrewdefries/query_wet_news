Washington Post:
Faced with severe budget problems, Republican governors are escalating their fight against federal rules requiring states to maintain current levels of health-care coverage for the poor and disabled.
The growing resistance to the federal government over the hugely expensive Medicaid program poses a critical test for President Obama, who has the power to relax the rules for states.

ATLANTA -- Health officials say nearly 1 in 4 babies are born to unmarried couples who are living together, a significant jump from a decade ago.
The government previously said more than 40 percent of births are to unwed mothers. But a report released Thursday offers new detail showing most unwed births occur in cohabiting couples.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study was based on face-to-face interviews with more than 22,000 men and women during 2006 through 2010.
About 23 percent of the reported births were to unmarried heterosexual couples who were living together when the child was born. That was up from 14 percent when a similar study was done in 2002. The CDC did not speculate on reasons for the increase.

There's some important news for millions of people -- most of them women -- who suffer from the syndrome fibromyalgia: a new study suggests that sleep deprivation is associated with an increased risk of developing fibromyalgia.
The study was conducted at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The study included 12,350 women. At the outset of the study, all the women were free of physical impairment, musculoskeletal pain and fibromyalgia. A decade later, 327 of the women -- 2.6 percent of the study population -- had developed fibromyalgia. Researchers asked all the women in the study to report on their sleep habits and their sleep problems. They found that women who reported sleep problems were significantly more likely to have developed fibromyalgia than women without sleep problems. The researchers also found that the risk of fibromyalgia increases with a woman's age, and with the severity of sleep problems:
Women who reported having difficulty sleeping "always" or "often" had nearly 3.5 times greater risk of fibromyalgia as women who did not have problems sleeping
Women age 45 and older who "always" or "often" had sleep problems had more than five times the risk of developing fibromyalgia as women without sleep problems
Younger women, ages 20 to 44, who "always" or "often" had difficulty sleeping were at three times greater risk of developing fibromyalgia than their counterparts who didn't have trouble with sleep
It's important to make clear that this study does not prove that sleep deficiencies cause fibromyalgia. What it does do -- for the first time -- is establish a strong connection between sleep problems and fibromyalgia, by showing the increased risk of fibromyalgia that is associated with lack of sleep. What is fibromyalgia? It's a syndrome whose main characteristic is chronic pain. Pain is often felt throughout the body, in muscles, tendons and soft tissues. With fibromyalgia, the pain is often felt at certain trigger points, and radiates from those points outward. People with fibromyalgia often experience daytime fatigue, which can be severe, as well as depression, anxiety and memory problems. Women ages 20 to 50 are at the highest risk for fibromyalgia. Men do develop fibromyalgia, but women are more than 10 times as likely as men to develop the syndrome. Fibromyalgia has a history that's both contentious and mysterious. For a long time, there was no consensus in the medical community about whether it even existed, whether it was a "real" disorder or an "imagined" one. This has changed, and the medical establishment now overwhelmingly accepts that fibromyalgia exists as a very real disorder. But much about the syndrome -- including and especially what causes it -- remains unknown. For this reason, and because there is no single test that can positively identify fibromyalgia, it remains difficult to diagnose. Since it can't be tested for, a diagnosis of fibromyalgia comes by way of eliminating other possible conditions. There are signs of possible genetic and environmental links, since fibromyalgia seems to sometimes run in families. Researchers have explored links between fibromyalgia and other diseases and disorders, including arthritis, depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue and restless leg syndrome, but no conclusive evidence has been found to demonstrate a causal link between fibromyalgia and these conditions. That said, all of these disorders are found more often in people with fibromyalgia than in the general population. Is sleep a cause of fibromyalgia? Again, we just don't know, and this current study doesn't answer that question. The relationship between sleep and chronic pain is complicated, and there is a lot we do not understand about cause and effect. Here's some of what we do know. The presence of chronic pain, such as with fibromyalgia, makes falling asleep and staying asleep more difficult. Sleep deprivation, in turn, can make people more sensitive to pain. Evidence that disrupted sleep can lead to a lower pain threshold includes this study. Researchers took a group of healthy, pain-free middle-aged women and disrupted their sleep cycle, depriving them of deep, slow-wave sleep, for three consecutive nights. They then tested their threshold for musculoskeletal pain, tenderness and also mood. After only a few nights of disrupted sleep, the women experienced a significantly decreased pain threshold (meaning they felt pain more quickly and intensely), as well as increased fatigue and general discomfort. We don't need to know the root causes of fibromyalgia to know that improving sleep is at the core of a strong treatment plan for the condition. If you're struggling with sleeping because of fibromyalgia or chronic pain, keep these strategies in mind to help improve and protect your sleep: Emphasize your rest. People with fibromyalgia simply cannot shirk their sleep routine. Make sure sleep stays a top priority, by setting up a schedule that allows for plenty of rest, and by creating a sleep environment that is relaxing, quiet, dark and conducive for sleep.
Exercise. Regular exercise can help manage pain itself. It will also strengthen your sleep-wake cycle, and help you sleep better. Schedule exercise earlier in the day, and outdoors in sunlight if you can.
Use relaxation techniques. Meditation, massage and mind-body exercise are also powerful tools for pain management and for sleep as well. One study found that after three months of regular Tai Chi practice (two, hour-long sessions per week), pain and depression among fibromyalgia patients had declined, and sleep had improved.
Avoid alcohol, tobacco and caffeine. These chemicals may make you feel "better" in the very short term, but they disrupt sleep and increase stress, among other negative consequences. With fibromyalgia, your body is coping with enough stress without exposing it to taxing chemical stimulants and depressants.
There is so much that we still need to learn about fibromyalgia itself, as well as the relationship between chronic pain and sleep. One thing that's not in question? Sleep is powerful healing tool. It costs nothing and doesn't require a prescription. Make sure you're using it to its greatest effect. Sweet Dreams,

How Netflix Is Ruining My Relationship (And Might Be Ruining Yours)
Zoë Triska
Senior Books Editor, The Huffington Post	What's not so nice? Having to wait for said person you love in order to watch the rest of the fully-released season. Here are the worst things for me about watching a show with my beloved.

Abusing Women Is Criminal, Not Cultural
Kelly Rutherford
Actress and activist	In some countries it is estimated that as many as seven out of 10 women are beaten, raped, abused or mutilated.
Comments 6 Things We Learned This Week From Goldie and Kim
Ann Brenoff
Senior Writer, The Huffington Post	The Academy Awards appearances of Goldie Hawn, 68, and Kim Novak, 81, triggered a firestorm of fan reaction. Both actresses appeared with what were perceived to be dramatically altered faces and the Internet was quick to harshly criticize them. Can we pause a moment and reconnect with reality -- both theirs and ours?
Comments Binge vs. Buzz: The Release Model of House of Cards vs. True Detective
Jeremy Wilson
Writer + Creative Strategist	There is no doubt Netflix's strategy of enabling users to binge watch old TV episodes has been successful, but is it the optimal strategy for releasing high profile new content?
Comments Aisle View: The Demon Barber of Lincoln Center
Steven Suskin
Drama critic	There is always a place for a production of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's Sweeney Todd, especially one that gives us an oversized orchestra filling the hall with Sondheim's masterful score.
Comments I Witnessed Hollywood's Sexism Firsthand -- And Said Nothing
Kathleen Miles
Associate Editor, HuffPost Los Angeles	One man said, "Would you rather keep the Oscar statue or get a blow job from any actress in the first three rows?"
Comments (359) Why American Women Hate Their Faces, and What They Could Learn From the Brits
Lorraine Devon Wilke
Sass & Sensibility	We've all seen one famous face after another tumble down the rabbit hole of peer pressure, cultural expectations, show business demands, sheer vanity, fear of death, revulsion of aging and the simple miscalculation that the only beauty is youthful beauty. It's a heavy burden.
Comments Dancing With the Stars
Diana Nyad
Long-distance swimmer, journalist, and broadcaster	Some behind-the-scenes snapshots from this morning's Good Morning America announcement of this season's cast of Dancing With the Stars.
Comments The Deceptively Simple Pattern in Popular Songs and Speeches That Makes Them So Catchy
Peter Watts
Writer and presenter	Sarah Palin, James Bond, and Austin Powers walk into a bar. What they do in the rest of the joke is anybody's guess, but what they might do is raise a toast to the darned clever writers who created their catchphrases.
Comments Why Belle Knox's Anonymity Was So Important, As Told by an Out Sex Worker
Eric Barry
Writer, comedian, and creator of the 'Full Disclosure' sex podcast	Belle Knox, who is impressively sagacious at just 18, is joining the company of some tremendous voices in the industry who are redefining what it means to be a sex worker.
Comments Mixology Season 1, Episode 2: The Bathing Proposal
Hulu.com
Watchers of Good TV	The hangover could be settling in earlier than expected for ABC's Mixology, the show about what happens to 10 singles over the course of a single night out in New York City.
Comments Film Fatal Assistance Spotlights Colossal Aid Failure in Haiti
Georgianne Nienaber
Writer and author	Fatal Assistance ably demonstrates the folly and damage caused by swarms of NGO's and Hollywood do-gooders that completely ignored the root causes of Haiti's problems pre and post earthquake.
Comments How Rob Minkoff Turned Mr. Peabody & Sherman Into the Original Modern Family
Jim Hill
Entertainment journalist and Walt Disney Company expert	It's ironic that Mr. Peabody & Sherman has a sequence involving the Trojan horse. Because according to the director of this production, this animated feature is actually something of a Trojan horse in and of itself.
Comments Mighty Movie's Temple of Bad: Karate-Robo Zaborgar
Dan Persons
Film journalist	Well, here's a ticklish situation: Is Karate-Robo Zaborgar a bad film, or a good film trying to be bad, or a film so good at being bad that it's actually bad?
Comments Talking With Mike Gordon, Jonny Two Bags, Seventh Key's Billy Greer and Jimbo Mathus, Plus a Loreena McKennitt Exclusive
Mike Ragogna
Music Biz Vet	"There's probably so many different kinds of albums we could have made, because they were all just little snippets, just moments, some of them maybe implied a song and some were just a lick. But I got all excited and I thought, 'We've got to keep doing this.' ... Some people go to an amusement park, we go sit in a room with guitars."
Comments Garcia v. Google: Hard Cases Make Bad Law
Schuyler M. Moore
Partner, Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, LLP; Author	The truth, for good or ill, is that judges rule with their hearts, and then they add a bunch of words to rationalize what they have done. The problem is that those bunch of words are often senseless and more often come back to cause contortions in later decisions.
Comments Content Before Celebrity, Sun Valley Film Festival Serves an Eclectic Menu
Gordy Grundy
Artist and Columnist	The Sun Valley Film Festival is young, with an attitude that is reflective of the city. The programming offers a preference for content over tinsel. The third annual film festival is presented this March 13-16.
Comments Pam Grier Talks 'Dining Out for Life' HIV/AIDS Event and LGBT Issues (AUDIO)
Charlotte Robinson
Broadcast journalist and host, 'OUTTAKE VOICES'	This week I talked with actor Pam Grier -- legendary for her starring roles in Foxy Brown and Jackie Brown, and for her role as Kit Porter on The L Word -- about Dining Out for Life, being a spokesperson for this fabulous event and her spin on LGBT issues.
Comments Older and Fabulous -- It's Not a Fantasy Hollywood Script
Jill Brooke
Author, "The Need to Say No: How to be Bullish and Not Bullied"	In aging gracefully, it's not about doing plastic surgery but over-doing it. It's about making good choices.
Comments Oscar Is Not Religious
Louis A. Ruprecht, Jr.
William M. Suttles Chair of Religious Studies, Georgia State University	The speech shouldn't seem canned and rehearsed or else you appear to have expected to win. It also can't ramble, as there's so little time. And if you have won for being an actor, well, then you're supposed to act well.
Comments Week in Film: Grand Budapest Hotel, The Face of Love
Marshall Fine
Author and film critic, hollywoodandfine.com	How do I love the work of Wes Anderson? Let me count the ways. Anderson may be the most consistently original filmmaker to emerge during the 25 years I've been writing about film in New York.
Comments Is Today's Young Music Too Obscene? (Or Has My Perspective Changed?)
The University of Central Florida Forum
Opinion series by faculty, staff and students of UCF	I still sometimes struggle reconciling the self of my youth with the guy who now has a mortgage and an SUV. But the minute I became a parent, my worldview shifted slightly on its axis and I began to view everything through new parental lenses.

As we approach crucial climate change negotiations in Cancún, Mexico, the key question on many people's minds is this: what nation or nations will have the courage to stand up to the United States, which still represents the key obstacle to a binding agreement on global warming? If it looked unlikely that the U.S. would reduce carbon emissions before, the recent midterm elections have made such a possibility seem even more remote: many incoming Republican legislators simply deny that global warming exists. Without any targets set for emissions cuts in the U.S., it will be difficult for Washington to fulfill its obligations under the Copenhagen accord, an agreement which many feel is already hopelessly watered down. A U.S. refusal to substantially decrease its emissions could in turn bode ill for future negotiations, since China will certainly claim that Washington is more historically responsible for global warming and is not doing its fair share to halt climate change.
Developing nations need to get their act together and exercise more pressure on the U.S. In recent years, a leftist bloc of Latin American countries, chiefly Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador and Venezuela, have sought to challenge the U.S. when it comes to setting climate change policy. Ringleader Bolivia, which was particularly opposed to the Copenhagen deal, wants to limit any increase in world climate change to less than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit). Yet, major emitters have failed to even meet Copenhagen's far less ambitious target of limiting the rate of increase to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). President Evo Morales, who some are pushing for the Nobel peace prize, recently organized a counter climate summit in Cochabamba. The Bolivian declares that $300 billion a year is necessary to cope with global warming and is lobbying hard for the formation of an innovative international climate court. Bolivia vs. the United States
There's been an escalating war of words between the U.S. and the so-called Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas or ALBA when it comes to climate change. Take, for example, U.S. climate envoy Jonathan Pershing who recently lambasted Bolivia, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba. The ALBA nations, Pershing claims, saw the Copenhagen process "not so much as a solution to climate change, but in fact as a mechanism to redistribute global wealth." Somewhat superciliously, Pershing added, "Well, surprise, surprise, surprise, the rest of the world doesn't want to do it that way." Not to be outdone, Bolivia's ambassador to the United Nations Pablo Solon tartly hit back "The US' deliberate attempts to sideline both democracy and justice in the climate policy debate is holding humanity hostage -- and will be viewed as both reckless and immoral by future generations." "It is time," Solon continued pointedly, "the US read the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's own reports, which in the Fourth Assessment clearly noted that 'Adaptive capacity is intimately connected to social and economic development, but it is not evenly distributed across and within societies.' Furthermore it states: 'Vulnerability to climate change can be exacerbated by... poverty, unequal access to resources, food insecurity, trends in economic globalization, conflict and incidence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS.'"
Hardly amused by Solon's broadside, the U.S. suspended its climate aid programs to Bolivia and Ecuador for not backing the Copenhagen accord. "The threats don't intimidate us," exclaimed Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa. "We weren't necessarily expecting this administration to...so blatantly use [the aid cutoff] against one of the poorest countries in Latin America," indignantly remarked Angélica Navarro, Bolivia's lead climate negotiator.
The AOSIS Plea
On the surface at least, one might expect the Group of 77 or G-77, a coalition of more than 130 developing nations, to be taking up Bolivia's call and to lead the charge against the U.S. However, internal cohesion is difficult to come by within the group as China, India and Brazil, all major carbon emitters, constitute part of the bloc. Together, these major "advanced industrialized economies," along with South Africa, have presented an obstacle toward reaching a binding agreement and have actually cut backroom deals with the U.S. to limit the scope of climate change negotiations.
With the G-77 fraying at the edges, what types of geopolitical alliances are we likely to see in future? The increasingly restive AOSIS bloc or Alliance of Small Island Nations, which stands to be inundated -- literally -- by climate change, is looking for diplomatic support. AOSIS believes that the world must limit warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst ravages of climate change. There's some disagreement on this score, however, and some fear that if climate change rises to more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) that many islands will disappear and Africa will be severely impacted.
Compromising somewhat at Copenhagen, the island nation of Tuvalu proposed that the UN climate treaty be amended so as to oblige nations to keep the increase in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In addition, the island nation sought to open discussions on a legally binding agreement to the Kyoto Protocol which would set greenhouse gas emissions targets for emerging economies starting in 2013. Tuvalu's move was backed by dozens of the poorest countries exposed to climate change including the Cook Islands, Barbados, Fiji and some African nations such as Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Cape Verde. "Our future rests on the outcome of this meeting," Tuvalu delegate Ian Fry declared.
The Anachronistic G-77
In a snub of small island nations, however, Brazil, China and India shot down Tuvalu's proposal and, in the end, the Copenhagen accord wound up backing a dangerous two degree Celsius temperature rise above pre-industrial levels. "Tuvalu has a very legitimate preoccupation for a most ambitious possible agreement," declared Sergio Serra, Brazil's climate ambassador during Copenhagen. "But we would not agree on a mandatory reduction target. This is not something Brazil is ready to discuss."
"What Copenhagen made blindingly clear," notes a recent column for the BBC, "is that the world has changed. We are in a new geopolitical era." There is no such thing as "developed" and "developing world," the article continues, as China and India will act as nakedly in their self interest as western powers when it comes to climate change. The traditional United Nations geopolitical blocs are out of date and have not allowed for "the creative emergence of hybrid coalitions from North and South." Instead of "anachronistic" groupings like the G-77 plus China, the world should look toward new blocs which recognize the future peril of climate change. If it were to step up to the plate and become a leader on climate change, the European Union would receive effusive thanks from the likes of AOSIS and the Maldives Islands. In 2008, the EU said it would unilaterally cut carbon emissions by 20 percent by 2020 as compared to the earlier benchmark year of 1990. Adding a further ray of hope, following pressure from Britain, France, Germany and the European Commission, the EU said it would reduce its emissions even further by 30 percent if other industrialized nations followed its example [needless to say, when the EU put its proposal on the table at Copenhagen, the measure was not reciprocated].
Sounds all fine and good, but when you get down to the nitty gritty of the negotiating table the EU has been way too timid. Indeed, the 27-nation group has signaled that it will only sign on to a new UN treaty if other big economies agree to make deeper cuts in their emissions. Der Spiegel meanwhile reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was frustrated by the lack of progress at Copenhagen and is moving away from her goal of limiting climate change to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Merkel has even signaled to the rest of the EU that she does not support the idea of the EU going it alone on climate change. The EU is now dumbing down its expectations for Cancún, hoping to achieve modest agreements on climate financing and a climate warning system. Even worse, EU member Britian has resorted to some of the same strong-arming as the U.S. Take for example climate secretary Ed Miliband, who has accused Bolivia and other left wing Latin American countries such as Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua of hijacking UN climate talks and "holding the world to ransom" to prevent a deal being reached. In a show of force, Miliband said the UK would make it clear to those countries holding out against a binding treaty that "we will not allow them to block global progress." In a rapidly deteriorating diplomatic imbroglio, environmental groups hit back at Britain and the U.S. for dictating the weak terms of the Copenhagen agreement and for imposing it upon the world's poor.
Forging a New Geopolitical Bloc
With the U.S. stonewalling any prospects for a good climate deal, and the EU, China, Brazil and India failing to heed the call of small island nations, environmentalists hope that ALBA may rise to the occasion. To be sure, individual nations within the ALBA bloc have, at times, conducted themselves rather questionably from an environmental standpoint. Take for example Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa, whose government sought to shut down the offices of Quito-based Acción Ecológica, and then, perversely, called indigenous peoples "infantile" when they protested unfair mining and petroleum laws. Then there's Venezuela, a major world oil producer which has been contributing mightily to global warming through its petroleum exports since the 1920s. President Hugo Chávez, moreover, has pursued boondoggle development projects such as the South America Regional Infrastructure Integration Initiative (known by its Spanish acronym IIRSA), which aims to integrate and synchronize strategic infrastructure works that will facilitate the development of natural resources. From a social and environmental standpoint IIRSA is a nightmare and, according to the environmental group Conservation International, could destroy much of the Amazon rainforest by mid-century, thereby exacerbating climate change. Perversely, once again, Venezuela has recently sought to downplay the warming component of its oil industry, arguing that other greenhouse gases are more potent.
Despite these serious environmental drawbacks, ALBA is still the only bloc of countries to advocate a more radical environmental critique. ALBA, however, does not have serious heft on the world stage. Aware of Bolivia's relative weakness, Morales has urged Japan not to sign on to the watered down Copenhagen accord in the hopes of preserving the tenets of the earlier Kyoto Protocol. AOSIS, ALBA and African nations could also lobby Brazil to abandon its counter-productive negotiating within the so-called newly formed group known as BASIC which includes China, India and South Africa, and move into the more progressive environmental camp. Accomplishing such a feat would be, admittedly, quite an uphill struggle. It was Brazil, after all, which cut a backroom deal with the U.S. at Copenhagen and which is determined at all costs to develop its burgeoning agribusiness sector. One cannot discount the possibility however that Brazil might become more of a progressive player at some point in future: in the first round of the country's recent presidential election Green Party candidate Marina Silva garnered a whopping 19% of the vote, a clear reflection of rising environmental consciousness. As we approach the Cancún climate talks, activists might consider making friendly overtures toward Brazil in hopes that the South American giant might come round. Incoming president Dilma Rousseff, a protégé of Luiz Inácio "Lula" da Silva, is hardly known for her green credentials though she is sympathetic toward the ALBA bloc in wider South America. Environmentalists might approach Brazilian officials at Cancún, yet another possibility is the United Nations at New York. Just seven years ago, activists paid visits to various European missions in the hope of stirring opposition to U.S. multilateralism in the Middle East. In the end, the Bush administration went to war in Iraq anyway, but that doesn't mean a concerted and friendly campaign directed at Brazil is not worth pursuing. What is more, the media is concentrated around the United Nations and small actions might attract world attention in advance of the climate summit in Mexico.
Activists can't do it alone, however: without the support of other South American leaders in the ALBA bloc Brazil is likely to do what is simply politically and economically expedient. ALBA leaders Morales and Chávez have been railing against the Global North for the last couple of years. Brazil, however, is now the third largest greenhouse gas emitter and a rising problem for everyone. ALBA leaders must now make a choice: what is more important, preserving their leftist alliance in Latin America or putting some more public pressure on Brazil?
