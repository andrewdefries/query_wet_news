JASON STRAZIUSO, Associated Press
DADAAB, Kenya — A U.S. aid official warned Monday that hundreds of thousands of Somalis could die as famine spreads, amid a visit to Kenyan refugee camps by the wife of U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.
Jill Biden on Monday visited the world's largest refugee camp, Dadaab, where tens of thousands of Somali famine refugees have arrived in recent weeks.
Biden's trip is the highest-profile U.S. visit to drought-stricken East Africa since the numbers of refugees began dramatically increasing in June. Biden said the aim of her visit was to raise awareness and convince donors to give more.
"What I'm asking is for Americans to reach out and help because the situation is dire," said Biden, who met with two Somali mothers and their eight children during her visit to the camp. "There is hope if people start to pay attention to this."
More than 29,000 children under the age of 5 have died in the last 90 days in southern Somalia alone, according to U.S. estimates. The U.N. says 640,000 Somali children are acutely malnourished, suggesting the death toll of small children will rise in the coming weeks.
USAID administrator Raj Shah said models predict that hundreds of thousands of people could die from famine.
More than 12 million people in the Horn of Africa are in need of immediate food aid, including nearly half the Somali population. The U.N. has declared five famine zones in Somalia, including the camps for displaced people in Mogadishu.
Aid was only reaching about 20 percent of the 2.6 million Somalis who needed it, said Mark Bowden, the U.N.'s top humanitarian official for Somalia. The situation was better in the Somali capital, where about half the city's 600,000 inhabitants were receiving aid, he said.
Transport and security were the two main problems, he said, and it was unclear what the effect would be of the Islamist withdrawal from their bases in the capital Saturday. There have been several serious gunfights at aid distributions recently, and at least 10 people have been killed.
"An absence of conflict does not mean that there is security here," he said. "There's always been factions and militias."
Kiki Ghebo, another top U.N. humanitarian official, said different kinds of aid were needed: food for the starving, vaccines and medical help to prevent disease outbreaks, and things like plastic sheeting and cooking utensils for those who had been forced to flee their homes because of the war and famine.

We need to learn from this crisis that there are many factors that contributed to it. One is conflict. And conflict resolution should be essential. Glen Pearson: African Famine: "I See You"
One of Bev Oda's enduring memories was the leathery and cracked feet of the children who had walked for kilometres and the stunned look on the faces as their bodies struggled to survive.	Dr. Bill Frist: Inside Dadaab Refugee Complex: What Is Working, What is Not
We heard stories from motherswho had lost their husbands. Families who journeyed for weeks to arrive malnourished and in need of medical assistance. And parents who had heartbreaking stories of losing children in the flight from famine in Somalia.	Craig and Marc Kielburger: Dadaab: What Will Happen Now?
Journalists predicted that the rains would come in October, implying that this would end the crisis. But by then, the planting season will have passed. The rains, if they come, will likely bring flooding and disease. The famine may peak in early December, as we are preparing to celebrate our winter holidays.	Erin Patrick: When Food Is Not Enough to Stop Famine
When children are starving, the most urgent need is to feed them. It seems simple, but is it really? This is the question humanitarian workers confront on a daily basis at the world's largest refugee complex, in Dadaab, Kenya.	Dr. Bill Frist: Visiting Refugee Camps in East Africa
Over 29,000 young children have died of malnutrition and disease in Somalia over the past 90 days. We are now on our way to the Horn of Africa to see what more we as a nation can do.

Books News
The HuffPost office is currently closed, and your humble books team have all had to evacuate from their apartments due to Hurricane Sandy. Which left us with a dilemma: alongside clothes, emergency supplies, flashlights, pets... what books to take with us? Here's our list below. If you had to evacuate too, let us know what books you took with you - or, if you didn't evacuate, what reading matter would you put in your suitcase?
Andrew Losowsky, Books Editor
Moranthology by Caitin Moran
This quick turnaround release of compiled newspaper columns by the author of How To Be A Woman comes out in early November. So far, very funny. The Dinner by Herman Koch
A disturbing-sounding novel that comes out here next year. Haven't started it yet, but it looks intriguing. An exuberant Gillian Flynn blurb does it no harm.
Plus Catcher in the Rye, our current Book Club pick!
Zoë Triska, Associate Books Editor
Both Flesh and Not by David Foster Wallace My boyfriend was the person who got me to read DFW, so I always turn to his writing in times of turmoil. His writing usually causes most of my thoughts to become dedicated to deciphering it that I have little time for worry.
The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
It's our book club pick this month, but it's also a comforting classic that reminds me of being a kid again.
Madeleine Crum, Associate Books Editor
Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis
I'd never read Amis' hilarious cult classic, and thought it'd be the perfect book to hunker down with because it's as thoughtful and astute as it is funny. A medieval history lecturer navigates the pretentiousness of university life and attempts to win over his dream girl.
The Best American Short Stories 2012 edited by Tom Perrotta
Newish writers and short story heavyweights such as Alice Munro, Edith Pearlman and George Saunders all make appearances in this anthology. If you're a little too preoccupied with hurricane prep to focus on a heady novel, a short story collection is a good choice.
What about you? What did you or would you take? Let us know in the comments!

He was our kind of guy until he wasn't, an ally during the Cold War until he no longer served our purposes. The problem with Osama bin Laden was not that he was a fanatical holy warrior; we liked his kind just fine as long as the infidels he targeted were not us but Russians and the secular Afghans in power in Kabul whom the Soviets backed. But when bin Laden turned against us, he morphed into a figure of evil incarnate, and now three decades after we first decided to use him and other imported Muslim zealots for our Cold War purposes, we feel cleansed by his death of any responsibility for his carnage. We may make mistakes but we are never in the wrong. USA! USA!
Kind of like when the CIA assigned the Mafia to assassinate Fidel Castro and the Mafiosi turned out to have their own agenda, or when Pentagon experts anointed the Catholic nutcase Ngo Dinh Diem as the George Washington of predominately Buddhist South Vietnam before they felt the need to execute him. A similar fate was suffered by Saddam Hussein, whose infamous Baghdad handshake with Donald Rumsfeld stamped him as our agent in the war to defeat the ayatollahs of Iran. Awkward, I know, to point out that bin Laden was another of those monsters of our creation, one of those Muslim "freedom fighters" that President Ronald Reagan celebrated for having responded to the CIA's call to kill the Soviets in Afghanistan. That holy crusade against infidels was financed by Saudi Arabia and armed with U.S. weapons to oppose a secular Afghan government with Soviet backing but before Soviet troops had crossed the border. In short, it was an ill-fated and unjustifiable intervention by the U.S. into another nation's internal affairs. Don't trust me on this one. Just read the 1996 memoir by former Carter administration security official and current Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, a book touted by its publisher as exposing "Carter's never-before-revealed covert support to Afghan mujahedeen -- six months before the Soviets invaded." This dismissal of the claimed Cold War excuse for the backing of the mujahedeen was acknowledged by President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who, when asked by the French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur if he regretted "having given arms and advice to future terrorists," answered that he did not: "What is most important to the history of the world? Some stirred-up Muslims or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War?"
That was said three years before some of those "stirred-up Muslims" like bin Laden and the alleged 9/11 plot mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- whom bin Laden financed, and whom he first met in Afghanistan when both were U.S.-backed fighters -- launched their deadly attacks on the United States. The cost of the American response to that assault has spiraled upward for a decade. A defense budget that the first President Bush had attempted to cut drastically because the Cold War was over was pushed to its highest peacetime level by the second President Bush and now with three wars under way equals the military expenditures of all of the world's other nations combined. But while Libya and Iraq have oil to exploit, what will be the argument for continuing the interminable war in Afghanistan now that bin Laden is gone? White House national security experts had already conceded that there were fewer than a hundred scattered al-Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan, and that these were incapable of mounting anti-U.S. attacks. Clearly, what remains of al-Qaeda is no longer based in Afghanistan, as the location of bin Laden's hiding place, in a military hub in Pakistan, demonstrated. Nor is there any indication that the Taliban we are fighting in Afghanistan are anything but homegrown fighters with motives and leadership far removed from the designs of the late bin Laden.
It is time to concede that the mess that is Afghanistan is a result of our cynical uses of those people and their land for purposes that have nothing to do with their needs or aspirations. Even if bin Laden had been killed in some forlorn cave in Afghanistan, it would not have made the case that he was using that country as a base. But the fact that he was in an area amply populated by the very Pakistani military and intelligence forces that we have armed, and that should have been able to easily nab him, gives the lie to the claim that Afghanistan is vital territory to be secured in what two administrations have now chosen to define as the war on terrorism.

When it comes to nutrition, sometimes it's hard to tell the fact from the fiction. Certain foods get a reputation as "bad for you," whereas others get promoted as "natural" or "good for you" when they are really not. Sometimes myths about foods are based on urban legends that just get perpetuated for years until we actually believe they are research-based. Other myths are based on old research that was not done in a scientific manner. Whatever the reason, here are some claims around a few popular foods that need to be debunked.
1.	Cheese is bad for you
I hear this one every day of the week. The answer lies in the type of cheese you eat. There is packaged, processed cheese and then there is artisan/European and grass-fed cheese. The European/grass-fed cheese is higher in omega-3 fats (anti-inflammatory) fats that are good for you. Cheese is also a good source of protein and calcium. Eating cheese from cows that have been fed growth hormones and antibiotics, and that contains multiple ingredients, fits the myth and should be avoided. You can find imported European cheese in the deli section of your grocery store.
2. Eggs make your cholesterol go up
It's beyond interesting to me that many people will avoid an egg yolk but will eat several packaged cookies during the day! Long-term studies found no relationship between egg consumption and heart disease. Studies do consistently link heart disease with a higher intake of trans fat, which is used in packaged foods to increase shelf life. However, the fat in eggs is mostly polyunsaturated and monounsaturated, and the yolk is an excellent source of the antioxidant lutein, which can lower certain inflammatory responses in the body. Eggs easily fit into a healthy lifestyle, so enjoy an omelet for breakfast and see how satisfied you are the rest of the day.
3.	Drinking juice is healthy and a good way to get your fruit
Many people love their morning juice! But experts say drinking juice is equal to the same amount of sugar as drinking a glass of soda. Dr. Charles Billington, a researcher on obesity at the University of Minnesota, states that juice is "pretty much the same as sugar water." Think of all the oranges or apples you would have to squeeze to obtain a cup of juice. You are drinking all the sugar from the juice, minus the fiber that helps stabilize your blood sugar when eating the fruit. Skip the juice and eat a few pieces of fruit per day to improve your health.
4.	Avoid avocados since they have too much fat
Avocados do contain fat, but it is the healthy monounsaturated kind, which does amazing things in your body. This is a food you want to include as part of your daily diet. Eating avocados can help with increasing the HDL (the happy kind of cholesterol), which you want higher since it helps with lowering heart disease by getting rid of bad cholesterol. Also, having healthy fats in your diet assists your health in multiple ways, including helping your skin and hair stay healthy and vibrant, providing adequate lubrication for the gut to help with normal digestion and absorption, and assisting with making hormones essential to the manufacture of sex hormones.
5.	Agave is a natural sweetener
Agave, which comes from the cactus and has been used to make tequila, hit the market a few years ago. You can find agave as a sweetener in most products found in health food stores... but is it really a health product? Using high-fructose corn syrup is a cheap way to sweeten foods. It was developed to help food companies cut costs. Whereas real sugar is 50 percent glucose and 50 percent fructose, high-fructose corn syrup is approximately 45 percent glucose and 55 fructose, and not the natural kind like in fruit. With agave, the percentages are altered more significantly -- the syrup is 85-90 percent fructose and 10-15 percent glucose. When you consume a large percentage of this type of fructose, it gets processed directly by your liver, which not only increases your triglyceride levels, but causes fatty liver, increased hunger levels and a plethora of other health issues you would rather avoid. The agave plant goes through heavy processing in order to concentrate it into a sweet syrup. Rather than being natural, as we've been led to believe, it is actually a processed food, often with few quality controls. As with everything diet-related, moderation is key, but don't be afraid to add European-style cheese, eggs and avocado to your shopping list. Drop the juice, add some fruit instead, and use honey instead of agave to sweeten your morning beverage. The result? A delicious, satisfying breakfast and a healthier you!

After a recent health scare, I'm taking better care of myself. And since 80 percent of the immune system is in our gut, I'm adopting a clean diet. But there's one little problem. I don't know how to cook. Kristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D.: Best Foods to Order on a First Date
There are many factors associated with a great first date. Of all the things that can go right or wrong, it's good to know that at least you can control the food.	Manuel Villacorta: For the Best Breakfasts, Look to Our Neighbors
The benefits of breakfast are almost too numerous to list. I find that more and more people now know that they should eat breakfast -- but they still ask me what to eat. My advice is to eat traditional foods.	Kathy Freston: An Apple a Day Melts the Pounds Away!
When you gradually add in nutrient-dense, fiber-rich foods, you simply stop feeling cravings. You run out of space in your belly for the old junk. Instead of craving, you feel full, fulfilled, and content. Kristin Kirkpatrick, M.S., R.D., L.D.: Eggs: What Are You Really Getting for the Claim on Your Carton?
If you purchase your eggs from a local farm or farmers' market, then you have direct access to the farmer to ask questions about the eggs they sell. If you're purchasing eggs from a grocery store, you may need a bit more help. Here's my guide to some of the common terms on egg cartons. Dr. Jonny Bowden: Egg Yolks: As Bad as Smoking? About That Study...
The idea that a food that contains 13 essential vitamins and minerals, high-quality protein, antioxidants, and brain-supporting choline should have almost as bad an effect on the heart as a pack of Salems just doesn't pass the smell test, even if your nose is clogged.	EatingWell: What to Eat to Beat an Afternoon Energy Slump
As the afternoon rolls along (or drags on, depending on your take), the office candy bowl sees an uptick in traffic. But a new study shows that it's protein, not sugar, that you should reach for to beat an afternoon slump.	Around the Web:
