Not Enough Sleep Could Increase Stroke Risk: Study

Healthy Living News
Most of us are aware of the main risk factors for a stroke -- smoking cigarettes, leading a sedentary lifestyle, having high blood pressure and/or cholesterol, among others. But now, new research suggests not getting enough sleep could also raise your risk.
A study presented at the SLEEP 2012 conference shows that middle- to older-aged people who regularly get fewer than six hours of sleep a night have an increased stroke risk, even if they don't have a history of stroke, aren't overweight and don't have an increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea. "These people sleeping less than six hours had a four times increased risk of experiencing these stroke symptoms compared to their normal weight counterparts that were getting seven to eight hours," study researcher Megan Ruiter, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told HuffPost. The study included 5,666 people who were examined by researchers over a three-year period for the symptoms of stroke, risk factors for stroke, symptoms of depression and demographics. Even though the researchers found a link between getting fewer than six hours of sleep a night and stroke among normal weight people, they did not find such a link in the overweight and obese study participants. "I was expecting that we were going to see some sort of association, but I really wasn't expecting it in the normal weight folks and not the overweight folks," Ruiter said. Ruiter added that short sleep may have this effect on stroke risk by acting on other, known risk factors: increasing blood pressure, spurring inflammation and altering metabolic hormones. "Once these traditional stroke risk factors are present, then perhaps they become stronger risk factors than sleep duration alone," Ruiter said in a statement. Because sleep is something that people can make a point to get more of -- meaning it's a "modifiable risk factor" -- the study findings could provide a basis for recommending sleep-based treatments to prevent stroke, she said. "A lot of people say that when things get stressful and schedules get tight sleep is the first thing to get sacrificed," Ruiter said. "It turns out that it's a lot more problematic than we previously realized."
Earlier this year, a study presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference showed that sleep apnea -- a sleep condition where a person suddenly stops breathing during sleep -- is linked with a symptomless form of stroke, called silent stroke. "We found a surprisingly high frequency of sleep apnea in patients with stroke that underlines its clinical relevance as a stroke risk factor," study researcher Dr. Jessica Kepplinger said in a statement.
Silent strokes don't have any symptoms, meaning a person typically doesn't know he or she has suffered one, ABC News reported. Having multiple silent strokes is linked with memory loss, difficulties with walking and mood problems.

Dear James:
When my little sister and her friends bumped into you at the Stanford Shopping Center a few years ago I thought it was really cool that you enthusiastically posed for a picture with them. They were freshmen at Palo Alto High School (Paly), your alma mater, and you just were starting your ascent to stardom. This was right after Spiderman, before you'd earned the title of "talented actor," before we knew you'd be a kick-ass host of SNL, before you were a famous writer of literary fiction.
That was five years ago. Now I hate you. I suspect I'm not alone. Another writer or two who posts articles on the Huffington Post probably knows where I'm coming from. It's an envy thing. Don't take it personally, but for me, it's personal.
I hate you because I also wrote a novel that takes place in and around Palo Alto. Like your recently released oeuvre, mine features local youth and has some dark undertones, but without the Brett Easton Ellis overtones. However, I made the tragic mistake of not titling my book Palo Alto, so no one seems to have noticed it's about Palo Alto. Your title is brilliant. I guess I should have been more literal.
No one reviewed my book about Palo Alto, not even local papers like the San Jose Mercury or San Francisco Chronicle--and I even put those publications in my book. Your book is being reviewed, well, everywhere, even in publications that don't normally acknowledge the existence of books, much less review them. I know what you're going to tell me. Your publicist is just more persistent than mine.
I hate you because your day job is cooler than mine, and I have a pretty cool day job. I'm an editor at CNET. I get to play with gadgets and hang out with tech bloggers. Sometimes I even get to be in the same room with Engadget's Joshua Topolsky. He's no Sean Penn or anything, but he is the resident tech-expert (real-title) at Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
And I guess I'm a teeny tiny bit envious of the fact that Gary Shteyngart blurbed your book. Harlan Coben blurbed mine. Coben sells a gabillion more books than Shteyngart does, but Shteyngart wasn't teaching at Columbia when I got my MFA there back in the 90's. Neither was Sam Lipsyte. (Of course, my tuition was about a quarter of what it is now, so I guess you get what you pay for, if indeed you paid anything for yours).
And I'm super sad that I didn't get to be in Shteyngart's book trailer for Super Sad True Love Story. In hindsight I can see that I was pretty naïve to think his publisher had hired you to play an MFA student. But then someone told me you actually were an MFA student and I realized you'd taken method acting to a whole new level.
I read somewhere that Mona Simpson was one of your creative writing professors when you were an undergrad at UCLA. Ms. Simpson is a fine writer, but dude, she's Steve Jobs' sister! The other thing I can't get over is how you're like the Zelig of graduate arts programs. Your Wikipedia entry says you moved to New York, "To attend simultaneously graduate school at Columbia University's MFA writing program, New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for filmmaking, and Brooklyn College for fiction writing, while occasionally commuting to North Carolina's Warren Wilson College for poetry. Franco has been accepted to Yale University's Ph.D. program in English, and will most likely begin the program in fall 2010, and will also attend the Rhode Island School of Design."
Damn, I didn't know you could double and triple dip like that. Here's a challenge: Attend every Ivy League school at the same time. You're James Franco. You can do it. And another thing. You get to price your ebook at full price. As someone who covers the e-book/e-reader market, I can say that most new authors can't sell a lot of e-books at $11.99. Only established authors--or James Franco--can do that. My e-book is selling for 3.99 and has spent almost a month in the Kindle top 100.
Alas, none of that seems to impress my sister. She refuses to read my book unless I get her a signed copy of your book. Any chance you can help me out, bro, even though I went to Gunn?
David Carnoy is an executive editor at CNET and the author of Knife Music. He grew up in the Palo Alto area and attended Gunn High School, the rival of Paly High, James Franco's alma mater. His favorite movie is Pineapple Express.
