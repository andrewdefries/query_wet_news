Crime News
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — They're hidden in babies' diapers, ramen noodle soup packages, footballs, soda cans and even body cavities.Not drugs or weapons, but cellphones. They're becoming a growing problem in prisons across the country as they are used to make threats, plan escapes and for inmates to continue to make money from illegal activity even while behind bars."You can pick states all across the country and you'll see everything from hits being ordered on individuals to criminal enterprises being run from inside institutions with cellphones," said Michael Crews, head of Florida's Department of Corrections.When two murderers serving life sentences escaped from Florida Panhandle prison last fall, a search of their cells turned up a cellphone used to help plan the getaway, drawing attention to the burgeoning problem. It was just one of 4,200 cellphones confiscated by prison officials last year, or 11 per day."The scary part is, if we found 4,200, we know that's not all of them," Crews said.And while prison officials are trying their best to keep cellphones out, it's not such an easy task. Jamming cellphone signals is prohibited by federal law, and it costs more than $1 million each for authorized towers that control what cellphone calls can come in and out of prisons. Some prisons even have to police their own corrections officers who sometimes help inmates receive contraband.In Texas, a death row inmate made several calls with a cellphone to state Sen. John Whitmire, who chairs the Criminal Justice Committee. Whitmire didn't believe it when he started receiving calls from death row inmate Richard Tabler."He held his phone out, I guess outside his cell and there was a very distinct prison noise. He said, 'Did you hear that?' and I said, 'Yup. That's a prison,' " Whitmire said. "I said, 'How'd you get that phone?' He said, 'I paid $2,100 for it.' I said, 'How do you keep it charged?' He said, 'I have a charger.' "The calls continued, and Whitmire had the phone investigated. The month before, Tabler used 2,800 minutes and was sharing the phone with other prisoners, Whitmire said. Tabler's mother, in Georgia, was paying the bill and collecting payments from the other prisoners' families.Tabler asked Whitmire if he could help arrange a visit with his mother. When she arrived in Texas she was arrested for her part in the prison cellphone scheme. Tabler wasn't happy about that and made another call to Whitmire. "He said he was going to have me killed," Whitmire said.In other cases around the country, infamous murderer Charles Manson, imprisoned in California, was found with a cellphone under his mattress, twice.Two Indiana prisoners were convicted of using cellphones smuggled in by guards to run an operation that distributed methamphetamine, heroin and other drugs. A prisoner in Georgia was accused this year of using two cellphones to impersonate a sheriff's lieutenant and scam elderly drivers who had received red light camera tickets, getting them each to pay about $500.In Oklahoma, a newspaper investigation found dozens of prisoners using cellphones to maintain Facebook pages. The Oklahoman found about three dozen inmates who were disciplined by prison officials and its reporters found about as many who hadn't been caught.Florida prisoners have also been using social media with cellphones."We've got inmates running their own blogs and all kinds of stuff. We stop it when we catch it, but it's very difficult to police the whole Internet. We don't have Internet police on our staff," said assistant corrections secretary James Upchurch.Those helping inmates smuggle phones into Florida prisons can be charged with a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison. In Mississippi, the penalty can be 15 years for having a cellphone in prisons.As corrections departments keep looking for new ways to stop cellphone smuggling, prisoners are finding creative, new ways to get them in."You may get a prepackaged, sealed ramen noodle soup — and it's completely sealed — the weight seems to be right, but when you open it, there's a cellphone inside," said Timothy Cannon, Florida's deputy corrections secretary. "They're very, very, very creative in the way they do some of these things."Phones have been hidden in the hollowed out centers of large stacks of legal documents. One corrections officer found two liter soda bottles that were used as floats outside a prison. When he pulled them out of a pond, bags containing more than a dozen cellphones each were found tied to them."We've found cellphones and drugs in babies' diapers" during visitations, Cannon said. "If they think you'd never search an infant child, that will be the next place they go to try to get it in."Phones hidden in body cavities can't always be picked up by traditional metal detectors, and many are wrapped in electrical tape to further avoid detection."We have found cellphones in the private area of visitors — I'm talking females and males," said Christopher Epps, head of the Mississippi prison system and president of the American Corrections Association. He said it's not unusual to find three phones in a body cavity.States are looking for new ways to find cellphones or to prevent their use. Epps said that includes recently installed netting held up by 50-foot poles to keep people from throwing bags over prison fences for prisoners to retrieve.Federal law prohibits jamming cellphone signals, but Texas, Maryland, California and Mississippi installed towers at some prisons that control what cellphone traffic is allowed. Phone signals reach the tower, but only authorized numbers are then passed through.It's not something Florida is considering because of the hefty price tag. Each system costs about $1.5 million, and with 49 major prisons, the state doesn't have the money to cover them all.Instead, it's testing machines that detect a cellphone's magnetic fields. And like Indiana and other states, Florida is also using dogs trained to sniff out cellphones.Still, with 100,000 prisoners in Florida, Crews knows the problem will never be completely solved, especially with the profit that can be made."When you're talking about that kind of money, you're going to have a lot of people who are willing to do just about anything to get them in," Crews said. "For a large portion of these inmates, it is about making a dollar."___Follow Brendan Farrington on Twitter: http://twitter.com/bsfarrington

How low would you go to catch your husband cheating? I'm flying without a net here, because it never occurred to me to try. My jaw was on the floor when we saw this week's story on Coffee Shop Confessions. The mom this week was so sure that her husband still carried a torch for his ex-girlfriend that she faked a Facebook profile and sent him dirty messages. When I tweeted my shock, someone wrote back that Facebook is now implicated in 40% of divorce cases. 40%? I couldn't believe it and turned to my good friend Google to check it out. The numbers vary, but there are plenty of articles out there claiming social media as a factor in a third of all cases, 40%, 50%, etc. Apparently our desire to share the ridiculous minutiae of our lives is so intense it supersedes propriety. Of course I wouldn't know anything about that, having willingly starred on a reality show for years! Wherever the information comes from, social media creates a fertile field of opportunity for divorce and custody lawyers.
What kills me about this week's episode is this -- the wife chose a real human being. She didn't lift a picture of a swimsuit model and make up an alter ego. She started a profile for a genuine person from her husband's past. How is she going to get away with this? What's the woman going to do when she finds out? What will the husband do if he finds out first? What would you do?

It is too early to know whether the current wave of school reforms will lead to lasting improvements in student achievement.

Twenty-one months after Barack Obama was inaugurated on a wave of hope for change in America's politics and policies, at least two important and seemingly contradictory things can be said. First, there has been a series of significant progressive reforms: an economic stimulus bill that contained far-reaching antipoverty, infrastructure, green...

While former Illinois Senator Barack Obama mulls flushing another $40 billion a year in our tax dollars down the toilet in Afghanistan -- that's the estimated annual cost of sending 40,000 more troops for the next several years -- graduate employees at the University of Illinois, a "land grant" public institution, are going on strike at 8 AM this morning Chicago time to protect their ability to complete their education, against threats from the University administration to withdraw tuition waivers from graduate employees.
For many teaching assistants and graduate assistants, the withdrawal of a tuition waiver would be an educational death sentence, a de facto financial expulsion from the University. But even though access to a tuition waiver is a basic condition of employment, since without also being students graduate employees would lose their jobs, the University of Illinois administration refuses to bargain the issue with the members of the Graduate Employees Organization, a local of the American Federation of Teachers, even though under Illinois labor law the GEO is the recognized bargaining agent for graduate employees.
The University administration claims that in a time of financial constraint, it needs "flexibility" to undermine a basic condition of graduate employment. It's true, of course, that the University is financially constrained, given the decline in government support for public higher education. But how the University responds to that environment is a choice. Trying to balance your budget by taking essentials away from the weakest people in the food chain is a choice - a choice often made, but still a choice.
The financial constraints that the University faces reflect the same skewed national priorities. Sons and daughters of America's working families are being sent to get blown up in Afghanistan's civil war at the same time that America is breaking its promise of universal access to education at home. We're enacting trade and investment agreements to allow corporate America to send high-wage manufacturing jobs out of the country -- the kinds of jobs where American workers could once comfortably support a family, having only obtained a high school diploma. That's why you need to go to college, the kids are told. But when they arrive at the schoolhouse door, they're told to come back with tens of thousands of dollars. Something has to give. What if President Obama decided not to send $40 billion worth of new troops to Afghanistan? How much money could that free up for education in Illinois? Illinois has about 4.2% of the U.S. population, so not escalating in Afghanistan could bring Illinois a $1.7 billion dollar windfall. If the federal government dropped an extra $1.7 billion a year on the State of Illinois, do you think that the state legislature and the University administration could find it in their hearts to protect the ability of graduate employees to complete their degrees? I think they could.
But regardless of what the federal government does, University of Illinois administrators still have a moral responsibility not to balance the budget on the backs of the weak. If you'd like to weigh in, instructions are here.
