In 1982, British new wave rocker Adam Ant scored a major hit with his song "Goody Two Shoes." Long after the song fell from the pop charts, Ant remained true to the its singalong chorus -- "don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?"When "Oprah: Where Are They Now?" caught up with Ant at his home in London, he explained why he stayed sober his entire career."My hero growing up was Muhammad Ali," Ant says in the above video. "There was arrogance there, but he could back it up."The athletic icon inspired Ant to do whatever he could to be at the top of his game – and that meant a substance-free lifestyle. "I'd never taken drugs or didn't drink or smoke, which is kind of a tough call when you're in a world surrounded by it," he says."I didn't want to be a goody two shoes, which is why I wrote the song – you know, I have the flamboyance, but I have the work to back it up."In the video below, OWN executive producers Julie Simpson and Jill Van Lokeren join HuffPost Live to talk more about the episode featuring Ant, including his distinctive fashion sense and the surprising job he had as a little boy."Oprah: Where Are They Now?" airs Fridays at 9 p.m. ET on OWN.

The super-faux lashes and pouty lips take the phrase "all dolled up" to a new level. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kiss/dp/B000VZPBAS/ref=sr_shvl_album_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1330727711&sr=301-5" target="_hplink">KISS</a>
It's so hard to pick a favorite KISS member... we're just happy were not taking this off at the end of every night. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Back-To-Black-The-B-Sides/dp/B0013G43U8/ref=sr_shvl_album_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1330727933&sr=301-4" target="_hplink">Amy Winehouse</a>
Miss Winehouse's look is one of the simplest and most iconic.

Of course Stephanie Germanotta's transformation into Gaga involves a lot of makeup in itself. But the makeover from Gaga to Joe Calderone was, even for Gaga, a shocker. Suggest a correction
