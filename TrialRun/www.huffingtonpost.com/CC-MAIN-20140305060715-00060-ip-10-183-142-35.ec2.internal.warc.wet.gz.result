Politics News
WASHINGTON -- Progressive senators working to dramatically alter Senate rules were defeated on Thursday, with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and his counterpart, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), set to announce a series of compromise reforms on the Senate floor that fall far short of the demands. The language of the deal was obtained by HuffPost and can be read here and here. The pressure from the liberal senators, led by Oregon Democrat Jeff Merkley and backed by a major coalition of progressive groups, created the political space for Reid to cut the deal with McConnell, which includes changes to how the Senate operates but leaves a fundamental feature, the silent filibuster, in place.
The deal will address the filibuster on the motion to proceed by changing the amount of debate time that would follow a cloture vote from 30 hours to four, speeding up Senate business and allowing more legislation to reach the floor. But the deal still requires Democrats to muster 60 votes to invoke cloture on that motion, despite Reid's earlier suggestion that he would bar a filibuster on that motion entirely.
An alternate route to get past the motion to proceed will be implemented as a change to the rules, and a filibuster on the motion would be barred if the majority can find eight members of the minority, including the minority leader, to sign a petition. But Democrats already have 55 members in their caucus, five short of the 60 needed to end a filibuster, so it's unclear what the purpose of getting three additional Republicans would be.
Under the agreement, the minority party will be able to offer two amendments on each bill, a major concession to Republicans. This change is made only as a standing order, not a rules change, and expires at the end of the term.
The new rules will also make it easier for the majority to appoint conferees once a bill has passed, but leaves in place the minority's ability to filibuster that motion once -- meaning that even after the Senate and House have passed a bill, the minority can still mount a filibuster one more time.
Reid won concessions on district court nominations as well. Under the old rules, after a filibuster had been beaten, 30 more hours were required to pass before a nominee could finally be confirmed. That delay threatened to tie the chamber in knots. The new rules will only allow two hours to pass after cloture is invoked before a nominee is confirmed.
The two leaders agreed that they will make some changes in how the Senate carries out filibusters under the existing rules, reminiscent of the handshake agreement last term, which quickly fell apart. First, senators who wish to object or threaten a filibuster must actually come to the floor to do so. And second, the two leaders will make sure that debate time post-cloture is actually used in debate. If senators seeking to slow down business simply put in quorum calls to delay action, the Senate will go live, force votes to produce a quorum, and otherwise work to make sure senators actually show up and debate.
The arrangement between Reid and McConnell means that the majority leader will not resort to his controversial threat, known as the "nuclear option," to change the rules via 51 votes on the first day of the congressional session. Reid may have been able to achieve greater reforms that way, but several members of his own party were uncomfortable with the precedent it would have set. And Reid himself, an institutionalist, wanted a bipartisan deal for the long-term health of the institution. Reid presented McConnell with two offers -- one bipartisan accord consisting of weaker reforms, and a stronger package Reid was willing to ram through on a partisan vote. McConnell chose the bipartisan route. Supporters of the deal insist that even without using the "nuclear option," Reid was able to secure tangible changes on the pace and conduct of Senate business. The deal, said one top Democratic aide, is "not everything Reid wanted but there are significant changes. Everybody was so focused on the filibuster, but as you know there were a lot of Dems who really felt uncomfortable going there. Let's face it, if not for 60 then Roe v. Wade might be dead and Social Security would be private accounts. But, Reid gets the power to get on bills without having to file cloture. That's a big deal. Also, post cloture time for non appellate judges will be cut from 30 hours to 2. That's huge because now Reid can stack nominations, which forces the Repubs' hands."
Added another supportive Democratic Senate aide: "We are now a more efficient Senate; we'll be able to get on bills without having 60 votes and without having to spend a week to do it. We are getting the ability to confirm certain nominees who have objections against them. Instead of taking a week to confirm them, it'll take a few hours. That's all Reid ever really wanted."
The compromise is a blow to Merkley, who had been the most outspoken proponent of what he called the "talking filibuster," which would change current rules so that the minority couldn't filibuster a bill by simply objecting and sitting down or leaving the chamber. Once that provision looked to be faded, reformers gravitated toward a proposal from Reid that would flip the onus onto the minority by requiring Republicans to affirmatively come up with 41 votes to sustain a filibuster, rather than requiring Democrats to find 60 to end it. Reid was only willing to go forward with such a move if McConnell had rejected his offer.
At Tuesday's closed-door caucus meeting, Merkley was upbraided by Reid for breaking unspoken Senate rules and naming specific senators in a conference call with Democratic activists last week, according to sources familiar with the exchange. "He's pissed off so many in the caucus," said one Democratic aide piqued at Merkley. "He has been having conference calls with progressive donors and activists trying to get them energized. He's named specific Dem Senators. Many are furious. He was called out on Tuesday in caucus and very well could be again today."
A Reid staffer was on the conference call with the activists and donors, and Merkley's move was reported the next day by Politico:
On a private call with the Bay Area Democrats on Wednesday, Merkley identified Reid as the key person in the talks, and he urged activists to target members of Reid’s leadership team ahead of their meetings next week, according to people on the call. He also characterized Democratic Sens. Max Baucus (Mont.), Patrick Leahy (Vt.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Barbara Boxer (Calif.), Joe Manchin (West. Va.) and Mark Pryor (Ark.) as wrestling with his proposal, sources say.
According to a source familiar with the call, the host, Wade Randlett, encouraged donors who were going to the inauguration to seek out senators at events, such as the Majority Trust reception last Saturday, and offered to coordinate contacts.
Fix the Senate Now, a coalition of over 50 progressive and labor organizations that has been tirelessly advocating for an end to the silent filibuster, called the emerging deal a "missed opportunity." "While the provisions included in the likely agreement may help with streamlining certain nominations, potentially a significant step forward, the agreement avoids measures that would actually raise the costs of Senate obstruction," the group said in a statement. "Neither the talking filibuster provision nor the shifting the burden provision is expected to be included in the final package. While certain details remain important and unresolved, such as potential conditions attached to the elimination of filibusters on the motion to proceed, we know enough to sum up the agreement as follows: a missed opportunity to provide meaningful filibuster reform, while advancing some decent procedural improvements."
In its statement, Fix the Senate Now also praised the "tireless advocacy" of Merkley and fellow Sens. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.). The coalition had been pushing for the Senate to adopt Merkley's talking filibuster proposal, and also called on Reid to implement other far-reaching reforms, such as requiring the minority to find 41 votes to maintain a filibuster. If the agreement proceeds as expected, the group said, the Senate "will have missed an opportunity to restore accountability and deliberation to the Senate, while not raising the costs of obstruction." CREDO, another group that had been pressuring the Senate to pass strong filibuster reform, criticized the deal in a statement.
"In 2010, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid sold out Senate Democrats by striking a 'gentleman's agreement' with Republican Minority Leader McConnell instead of pushing for strong filibuster reform," said Becky Bond, CREDO's political director. "And now he's done the exact same thing, again. When will Democratic Leadership learn the lesson that Republicans will not negotiate in good faith?"
"The bipartisan deal Sen. Reid struck is a compromised bait and switch deal which he and Sen. McConnell call filibuster reform, but we know will do next to nothing to actually fix the filibuster."
UPDATE: 4:00 p.m. -- As Senate Democrats trickled out of their caucus meeting, where Reid presented his deal with McConnell, the consensus appeared to be that while the reforms were not as far-reaching as they had hoped, compromise was better than taking matters into their own hands.
"It's a compromise, and I'm big on that," said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). "I think it's progress, and we're starting on the right foot. And if we would have started with blowing everything up, I think it would have been months before we could get back to a place where we could hope to try to really get back to regular order."
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said the deal was a real agreement between both leaders. "That is a very positive environment to start this session," he said.
Asked about complaints from filibuster reform advocates who were seeking an end to the silent filibuster, Durbin essentially said that life isn't always fair.
"Let me tell you, that's how this world works," he said. "People start aspiring at very high levels, then you get a negotiation, then you reach something called compromise. And I think we are at that point."
Durbin said there was overwhelming support for the deal among Senate Democrats, though he conceded that he was uncertain whether it would make it easier to pass bills.
"It can," he said. "It requires good will [and] good faith."
Durbin also backed up Reid's claim that he had the 51 votes necessary to use the so-called nuclear, or constitutional, option, but he said the goal was always to avoid using extreme measures and instead reach a compromise that both the majority and minority would be comfortable with.
McCaskill, too, hinted that more could have been done had Reid gone forth without Republicans -- but she remained enthusiastic about the deal's prospects.
"Will it work as well as some of us want to? That remains to be seen," she said. "But it's going to be better."
Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), who cosponsored the bipartisan bill that the final deal most closely resembles, had no complaints.
"It'll give great momentum to working on a bipartisan basis in the Senate," Levin said. "What we've avoided in a bipartisan approach is the use of this nuclear option or constitutional option, which Democrats strongly opposed when the Republicans threatened it a few years ago."
"If it were used, if it had to be used, it would have turned a gridlock into a meltdown," he added. "The Senate would have had a meltdown."
This article was clarified to note that the proposed two-hour post-cloture debate rule would only apply to district court nominees, rather than all judicial nominees.

Having been in the Internet tech industry since its early days, I have seen lists produced by many publications where the top 10, 25, 50, or 100 visionaries, innovators, entrepreneurs, VC's, startups, apps, etc are touted, highlighted, and held up as examples of our never-ending meritocracy. On a few occasions I have even been included in some, and sometimes I admit being disappointed to not be included on some others.
Although lists might seem silly, as a society we always seem to be interested in who is up and who is down, especially if they are competitors, friends, people we have met, or would like to meet. I am as much a contributor to this behavior as anyone I know, subscribing to this ethos and never really thinking about it twice until now.
Four days ago I found out that I was named to The Daily Beast/Newsweek's Digital Power Index, winning the ninth spot in the category for "Evangelists." There were nine other categories like "Innovators," "Visionaries," "Angels," etc. I quickly scanned the list, saw some really amazing names, and said to myself: "Wow, this is cool," and immediately tweeted a link out thanking The Daily Beast/Newsweek for the recognition. I then enjoyed a few joyful feelings of professional validation and continued on my way.
Then Wednesday, I read Rachel Sklar's thoughtful piece criticizing not only the way the index was compiled (See my P.S. below, on that) but the whole way that we as an industry and as a society reinforce behavior that doesn't give women proper credit. At first I was mortified that I didn't notice myself that among the 100 names cited on the list, only nine were women. You see, when women are minimized, our perspective is narrowed. I am not suggesting we should look to some formula of what constitutes diversity, rather, we should realize that when we minimize women, we then lose out on the priorities and unique approaches that women bring to solving problems throughout the world, digital or otherwise. My team and I pride ourselves on the fact that we go out of our way to achieve as much gender balance as possible at our Personal Democracy Forum conference which we produce every year. But now I realize that even by that measure, I am personally and professionally falling way short, if I am not seeing the imbalance naturally. This is not OK for me and not OK for our industry. And it is not OK for our now global connected society either. I want to do something about it!
So I am sending a letter to The Daily Beast/Newsweek, respectfully saying "Thanks, but no thanks," and asking them to remove me from the list and replace me with a woman I respect in my field who I think is an awesome evangelist, Deanna Zandt, who based on their selection criteria could have been easily listed in several of the other categories too. (By the way, see her great talk at PDF called "Don't Mess With Our Boobs: Ad-Hoc Networks and Online Power" which could have never been given by a man!)
I am also writing to every single man I know on the list whom I have email addresses for (about 25) and asking them to also name a woman they admire and who should be on "the list." I will also ask them to connect me with the other men on the current list I don't know, so I can ask them to join us.
When we are done, I hope to then go back to The Daily Beast/Newsweek and ask them to republish the list with our recommendations with a promise from them that next year, assuming they do it again, they will take gender balance into better consideration. By the way, Newsweek should have known better from the start, particularly after their public mea culpa two years ago publishing a 2000-word essay by Jessica Ellison, Jessica Bennet, and Sarah Ball, chronicling gender discrimination in Newsweek offices, which also reminded everyone of the fact that Newsweek had to deal with a very public lawsuit about the same problem in 1970.
I am not looking to create a new properly balanced list of the digerati. (Even if if we could successfully balance such lists in the future, they would fall far short of being truly diverse in race, ethnicity, age, or physical challenges). What I am hoping to do is to pick up the conversation that we ALL MUST HAVE, that women like Rachel Sklar have worked hard to start and maintain.
We ALL need to agree and work together to stamp out gender discrimination once and for all from our industry. As it succeeds to make us all the more connected it might be able to help stamp it out elsewhere too. Please join me.
Andrew
P.S. As Rachel Sklar points out in her piece, I have nothing against the judging panelists who are all amazingly accomplished people in their own right. However, of the 52 total "panelists" only 12 were women. Also, oddly in the case of the "Virologists" category, two of the panelists, the amazing Jonah Perretti and Ben Huh, were also selected as two of the top ten. Should that happen?

Sitting in a restaurant in Kabul, I was introduced to an American journalist. As usual, the first thing I asked him was whether it was his first time in this part of the world. Unsurprisingly, his answer was very derogatory. "No, I have been to a couple Badistans before," he answered, referring to the countries whose names ending with -istan. Unfortunately the western media has given such a bad image of Afghanistan and other Badistans that it is difficult for most of the westerners to imagine that there is a good Afghan or Badistani in this world. If Westerners always consider us evil how can they expect us to respect them? There is an old saying among Afghans: "You pay respect, you get respect."
If today, Afghans or Pakistanis or any other Badistanis are fundamentalists, extremists, and terrorists it is because the West wanted them to be that way so that they can could be easily used against the communist forces during the occupation of Afghanistan by Soviets. I can't find the right words to explain my feelings when I read comments of the readership of some of the American newspapers. You call us cockroaches, crooks, savage, uncivilized, and so on. But have you ever asked yourself what caused the Badistanis to be bad and savage, or why we are uncivilized?
It was the U.S and its western and Asian allies who suppressed every single enlightening and democratic movement by the very people that the U.S-led coalition forces are engaged in the 9-year-old war in Afghanistan and Pakistan right now. They needed to do so because their ultimate goal was to defeat the Red Army and save the so-called free world from communism, not to free Afghanistan. The very people who kill your sons and daughters in Afghanistan are the people that your governments trained and supported three decades ago. You are not the only people paying for your government's mistakes. How many Americans or Europeans have been the victims of international terrorism so far? A few thousand? We have lost over 2 millions people as a result of your governments' foreign policies, and your soldiers still continue to slaughter my people today. How many of us should die until your politicians' thirst for killing my people is quenched?
If the death of an American or European soldier makes you frustrated, remember that we feel the same grief when your soldiers slaughter our women and children. We are human beings too. We also have feelings and love our families and countrymen. An American's tears are not worth more than an Afghan's. And let's stop making this mistake: perpetuating the myth that so-called terrorism and extremism -- or what ever you call it -- is our problem. It is West's mess and it is obligated to fix it, but unfortunately it is to late for that.
You sit in U.S. or in Europe, in sterile government buildings, and you judge us from there but do you have a clue what is going on the ground? The realty is different from what you have been told by your mean stream media. Before making any judgment you should come to Afghanistan and see how your soldiers and diplomats treat people. If your soldiers behave like occupying forces, keeping human body parts for trophies, how can you expect us to respect them and treat them as our guardians?
I have frequently read in the western papers that Afghans don't like foreigners and they are very xenophobic. Who likes foreigners? What would an American do if Afghan soldiers established a base next to a school in New York City? What would for example, a Brit would do if Afghan soldiers raid his house in the middle of night and kill his pregnant wife and small children. It is common sense, isn't it? I am sure the very people who call themselves the civilized human beings, the Americans and European, will do exactly what the Afghans do if they were forced to suffer the the occupation that Afghans endure.
Your soldiers are not here to make life better for us. There are here to protect your countries' interests, not to improve human rights and democracy in Afghanistan. Unless your governments' interests are in endangered why would they care about 100,000 residents of Kabul slaughtered by your governments' trained dogs during the civil war, or tens of thousands of Hazaras massacred by the Taliban. How can you expect us to be civilized and behave like normal human beings after your governments were paying the extremists and Islamists to burn down schools, and kill teachers, school kids and government employees in the 1980s. How can you expect my people to treat their woman like humans after your spy agencies were given hundreds of thousands of dollars to fundamentalists to throw acid on women's faces?
If you still think that burning schools, killing school kids and teachers and women rights violation started with the Taliban, I have to tell you that you are wrong. It started with the first group of U.S trained and U.S backed fundamentalist in 80s and it still continues. The very people that your governments call terrorists and extremist were once the holy warriors of the United States and Europe. Some Americans even went so far as to liken them to the founding fathers of the United States. Isn't that funny? You should ask yourself what happened? Why yesterday's friends are today's enemies? For your government, yesterday's friends are today's enemies, and today's friends are tomorrow enemies. They have to stick to this policy otherwise American war profiteers can not steal billions of tax payers money.
You can call us extremist, fundamentalist, savage, uncivilized or what ever you think suits us and treat us like dogs and animals, but remember one thing: Unlike the United States Afghanistan was not founded fundamentalists and fanatics. Our civilization is much, much more older than yours. Today's America came to existence 500 years ago while as Afghanistan has a history of 5000 years. We are fundamentalist and conservative because you governments wanted us to be this way. And that is the greatest shame of all to our people.
I agree that Afghanistan is one of the most uber-conservative countries in the world. But this is what you get when you toy with people's religious beliefs and convictions. I don't blame the ordinary westerners because they have been deliberately kept in dark by their governments. Your governments tell you that they have spent billions of your tax money in Afghanistan to make life better for the Badistanis. If things have not changed in Badistan it is because the Afghans don't want to change or they will tell you that it is in the nature of the Afghans to oppose civilized life. The truth is that Afghans want to be civilized but the problem is that your governments are not honest with what they say. They never have been.
You want us to change? Fine. But you cannot change us overnight. If you attained your civilized society now, after hundreds of years of struggle, how can you expect us to get it in 5 or 10 years? The Afghan society can be changed but this change should come from within the society, not by imposing it on it. No one can change Afghanistan but Afghans. Maybe the western democracy works in U.S. and Europe but it is not a good recipe for Afghanistan. We need your support and help there is no doubt about it but allow the Afghan people the autonomy to decide what is good and what bad for Afghanistan.

I really don't know how to begin. I've never considered myself much of a writer, well not a writer at all -- I always took on the verbal part of our business, have always been the "people person." But when I was asked to do this blog I was honored to say the least -- and the fact that I've spent the past 2 plus years working hard on trying to find my own inner voice -- this comes at a perfect time. Let me introduce myself -- my name is Elissa Kravetz. I co-own a bi-coastal PR agency with my sister and have been working in the cut throat, fast paced, and too often soul sucking industry that is PR for the past 12 years. I take my job seriously, I've taken all of my jobs seriously ever since I was a little girl, I think that's the incredible work ethic instilled in me from my father. What I don't do anymore is take the industry so seriously -- I used to think this was IT! This was what life is about -- going to fabulous parties and wearing amazing clothes and which celebs we were hob-nobbing with on any given night. I used to work 20 hour days, every day, yell at my staff, make my partners crazy -- and the truth is... none of it really matters.
I've been seeking a greater truth, something to bring me real happiness and peace, and going from Barneys to Soho House just wasn't doing it.
I started traveling. Last summer I went to Bali alone on a yoga and pilates retreat and that trip awakened something in me. Just seeing the people there smile with all their heart and soul and more often than not they were smiling with no teeth, but they were happy. Joyful. Full of life. And poor. Monetarily poor but so rich in their hearts. I came home from that trip and knew that I would never be the same. I stopped shopping. I started feeding the homeless every other Sunday. Started doing more yoga and meditation. The next trip was India.... now talk about a place that will get inside you and rock your world to the core. I found India to be the most incredible, amazing, wonderous, horrifying, maddening, beautiful, inspiring place in the world. I spent a short time at an orphanage called Ramana's Garden and that place changed me forever. After spending time there with the magical children and Prahba (the angel of a woman who created this safe haven for the kids), how on earth could I come back to LA and just talk about shoes and jewelry all day every day? I needed to do more. These trips and new awaking definitely made me better at my job, more present, more intuitive to my client's and employees needs. I certainly didn't want to abandon my business, my clients, staff, and sister who I've worked to build this agency with...but there was a burning in me telling me "you need to do something more! You need to find your calling." And this is how The Farley Project came to life. The Farley Project is (or rather, will be) a charity aiming to make a bold impact in the ever increasing culture of bullying. We are going to travel to middle schools and camps around the country educating about the effects of bullying and developing programs for students, parents and teachers to try and get this epidemic to stop!
Through my own inner personal journey and healing over the past few years I've realized how much of an effect my being bullied has had on my life. I was bullied horribly towards the end of 7th grade. I got through it and lived the next 20 years of my life knowing that it affected me, but never realized to what extent. Through yoga and meditation and boxing and breathing workshops I've realized how much sadness and anger I've held in all of these years -- resentment I've had towards my "bullies." The girls who beat me up, who made me eat lunch in the bathroom stall, who wrote "die bitch" on my locker -- I was holding feelings in for 20 years. Outwardly I've been this secure girl but inside I always felt scared that people would get mad at me at the drop of a hat and I've always held my true feelings inside. Once this got into my consciousness and I realized that I had to do something -- things started serendipitously falling into place. I was asked to speak at an anti-bullying lecture at Elmhurst Elementary School in the valley last year. I spoke about the power of an apology and how cool it would be if the bullies would not only stop, but apologize. When I was done about 20 kids stood up and one by one started apologizing to each over the microphone in front of the whole school. It was magical. I knew just then that what I had to say could make a real difference. I was then asked to speak at my old overnight camp this past summer in New Hampshire. I went to overnight camp for 11 years, it was a safe haven for me, especially the summer after 7th grade. When I heard that bullying was happening at camp it made me sick. For four months when I was bullied I slept in bed with my parents every night, sick over what I knew was to come when I went to school the next day. I couldn't imagine the kids who were being bullied at camp during the day -- and then having to literally sleep in the bunk with the ones doing it...I'm sure it was nothing short of torture. I spoke to the counselors about the power they have. How they literally have the ability to save a child's self esteem. But just paying a bit of extra attention to the "shy ones" and by not ignoring when they see kids being nasty to each other. I find that most times teacher and counselors just don't know what to do with the situation, so they do nothing at all. But if they keep their eyes open and are kind to everyone, and act when they see a problem, they have the ability to change lives. When I was done the director of my camp gave me a check -- something I did not want and was not expecting. I held the check in my wallet for months meditating on what to do with it. That's when it hit me "I am going to start an anti-bullying non-profit and we are going to make a SERIOUS difference in kid's lives." It's called The Farley Project because Farley was the name of the middle school where I was tortured for months on end. Now -- let me say this, I don't know the first thing about starting a non-profit! But I do know how to build a business, and that I'm super passionate about making a difference, I've also put together a pretty kick ass supportive board of directors. This blog will detail my journey of straddling two worlds, going from publicist to life changer...

This is the ninth in a series of 12 posts expounding on the 2011 forecasts in the annual trends report from Salzman, president of Euro RSCG Worldwide PR and an internationally respected trendspotter. "The dollies got restless." This line from an article in Newsweek in March 2010 remembering the landmark 1970 class-action suit that 46 female workers who were consigned to secretarial roles (dubbed "the dollies" by male co-workers) filed against Newsweek. As telegrams used to say: stop. This year's article, written by three women staff writers, discusses the gender bias conditions that ignited the legal and moral hot seat -- and how things look in the operation today (for doing so, the magazine won kudos from no less than Ms.).
The writers (among the women who make up 49 percent of the magazine's personnel now) are, in their own words, "post-Title IX women, taught that the fight for equality was history; that we could do, or be, anything." In their deeds -- on their new blog, for instance--they actualize the self-empowerment they describe as emanating from role models, such as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton answering a moderator in Kyrgyzstan inquiring into her fashion preferences with, "Would you ever ask a man that question?"
Even considering Clinton's position, the dizziest heights of political, corporate and academic power are still be occupied by men -- but for how much longer, and with what effects not only on classroom, boardroom and (Senate) cloakroom, but also on bedroom, children's rooms and laundry room? Given that so many men cannot expect that the Y chromosome imparts a head start any longer, in 2011 many of them will be reeling (or, at least, seeking new equilibrium) on a seesaw weighted heavily by females. That is, it's Sadie Hawkins Day every day, and if the changing world means dancing to a new game of musical chairs, the world's men now will have to cope without whole rows of chairs being reserved exclusively for them.
To really plumb the questions that men and women both are having to face next year -- and to understand that two really different emo-coping styles will accompany the debate and the search for answers (a quest that we'll see play out even more) -- we must go fishing. The expedition begins in the very real and very impressive gains that World Economic Forum has cited in a 334-page study of milestones in gender parity: "We are at a unique turning point in history. Never before has there been such momentum around the issue of gender parity on the global stage," begins the preface. The 134 countries covered, which represent more than 90 percent of the world's population, the report says, "have closed almost 96 percent of the gap on health outcomes between women and men and almost 93 percent of the gap on educational attainment." Case by case, it gets better: In 2018-19 in the U.S., doctoral candidates are expected to stack up like so: 40,800 men to 49,600 women. Already in the U.S., women earn 51 percent of doctorates (and 57 percent of bachelor's degrees; 61 percent of the master's). Women are the primary or co-breadwinner for two-thirds of American families today. But wage gaps linger. Even as women perform better educationally, U.S. Department of Education data show that a year out of school, despite having earned higher college GPAs in every subject, young women will take home, on average across all professions, just 80 percent of what their male colleagues do. Even at the top end, female M.B.A.s globally make $4,600 less per year in their first job out of business school.
A new definition of feminism might be key to the reality we all recognize -- whether we believe anymore in the phrase "the glass ceiling" (coined in 1986) or feel we could parse "separate but equal" in a new way. Questions persist: What is women's work worth? What is men's work worth? And we're talking more than just money. As terrains that get glossed on the evening news, these are routes being trekked daily on the domestic homefront. There, everything from tasks around the house (including child care and elder care for the sandwich generation) to sexuality to coping styles are proving possible minefields--and points for exploration about the future.
A U.N. report shows women are, in general, still spending at least twice as much time on housework and child care as men in developed nations. And the overwhelm appears to go straight to fertility and childbearing. In countries where old-style male attitudes tend to prevail and men have been slow to do their fair share, fertility rates have fallen; the rate is now 1.20 children per woman in Japan and 1.32 in Italy. In South Korea, women are highly educated but earn far less than men and are less employed by local companies; the fertility rate there is a world low of 1.22 per woman. By contrast, in countries where men don't object to playing a more evolved domestic role, birth rates have held up and stand at 1.92 in the U.K., 1.66 in the Netherlands and 2.06 in the USA. In "Boardwalk Empire" -- set during Prohibition (which started in 1920, the same year women won the right to vote) -- Enoch Thompson (Steve Buscemi) discovers he isn't the boss of his lover-suffragette Margaret Schroeder (Kelly Macdonald), as he thinks he is of everybody else. Contemporary men also are no longer automatically the head of household, the sexual initiator, the protector and provider, the decision-maker. And in 2011, we'll see men decreasingly masters of all they survey. How will men take to being labeled a sex object? Or dowdy keeper of the hearth?
Surely, we are all going to need to learn a new language to conjugate contemporary sexual politics for new and deeper meaning. Gender has bent. It will keep on flexing. Commercials during prime-time football games for the new season of "V" keep depicting the boss-cyborg in a crewcut, the human woman wearing long tresses and writhing in passion. An interesting sign. Perhaps the new language we learn will need to be a wiki-language, where definitions can be edited by anybody else in the maze. "Labryinth" is the word used by Harvard Business Review writers who call out "the complexity and variety of challenges" ahead for gender equity at work -- where, we can't doubt, women are rising up strong. Myth has always been a good metaphor. With men objecting strenuously not just to women's advanced power but the reductionism of depictions for those left behind (sex object or frump?), it bears remembering the original labyrinth, for which Ariadne gave Theseus a ball of thread to find his way out after killing the Minotaur. Today, the thread will be carried by women, actively threading needles with the power of higher education and jobs, and held by men, finding pace in the rhythm that coming home is not always defeat.

You're in a new environment. You don't know anyone. You look around the room and try to size people up. Whom should you talk to? Who is likely to like you? Some people immediately rub you the wrong way. Others seem more attractive. Everyone else at that party is doing the same thing. You know you are being judged, just as you are judging others. Welcome to the fascinating world of person perception.
Recent approaches are allowing us to dig deeper into person perception and pinpoint the factors that influence popularity at first sight. A new approach that holds particular promise is the Social Relations Lens Model, which integrates a number of prior approaches. The model allows researchers to investigate the components of interpersonal attraction and make a more finely-grained analysis of the personality traits and cues involved in the perception process.
Adopting this framework, Mitja D. Back and his colleagues conducted a comprehensive study that included multiple personality traits and behavioral cues. At the beginning of a freshman introductory psychology class, 73 German students (52 female and 21 male) were randomly assigned a seat as they entered the classroom. One by one, each student went to a marked spot on the floor and briefly introduced himself or herself. The introductions, which lasted from 4 to 21 seconds, were videotaped. Each person was then evaluated by the rest of the freshman on two dimensions: liking ("How likable do you find this person?," "Would you like to get to know this person?"), and meta-perceptions of initial liking ("How likable will this person find you?," "Will this person like to get to know you?"). Each freshman was also given a packet of questionnaires to complete at home, including measures of personality. Among other personality traits, the personality battery included 35 items related to self-centered values (e.g., social power, forgiveness, success, courtesy, ambition), which were combined to form an overall dimension of self-centered vs. self-transcendent values. Afterwards, all videotapes were coded by independent observers for observable physical, nonverbal and audible cues.
Who Is Popular?
Those high in neuroticism and low in self-esteem expected to be disliked, when in reality neither neuroticism nor self-esteem were related to popularity. It seems, then, that neurotic people and those with low self-esteem have inaccurate perceptions of reality. Extroverts, on the other hand, were more liked and were also expected to like others more. In reality though, extroversion was not related to being a liker or expecting to be liked.
Most alarmingly, those who reported more self-centered values were more liked and were also expected to like others more. In reality, self-centered people actually disliked others more, evaluating their peers more negatively! Therefore, while self-centered people may be perceived as more friendly, they are actually less friendly.
Why were extroverts and self-centered individuals evaluated more positively? What cues were they broadcasting that influenced their popularity? Extroversion was related to cues that had a positive effect on popularity: fashionable appearance; speedy, energetic and self-assured body movements; friendly facial expressions, strong voice; and original self-introductions. Interestingly, those with self-centered values tended to display very similar cues.
Prior research has linked the popularity of the extrovert to their desire to captivate the attention of others, their expressive behaviors, verbal humor and fashionable dress. This study shows that both extroverts and self-centered people share similar behavioral cues. These cues appear to be related to emotional expressiveness and social dominance. Extroverts and self-centered people both are signaling these traits, and these traits influence popularity. Interestingly, prior research has shown that people accurately perceive extroversion even after only being exposed to a face for 50 milliseconds! Consistent with the Back and colleagues study, signals such as cheerfulness and positive facial expressions were particularly related to extroversion.
Independent of personality, the researchers also found that friendliness of facial expression (amount of smiling) and pleasantness of voice were the best predictors of liking and meta-perceptions. Unsurprisingly, prior research has also found that smiling plays an important role in attraction. Additionally, students with baby faces were perceived as likers.
Birds Of A Feather
The researchers also looked at similarity effects. According to the prominent social psychologist Roy Baumeister, the influence of similarity on attraction is "one of the best known findings in social psychology." Their results are consistent with earlier research in social psychology.
Participants who had similar preferences regarding subcultural scenes (e.g., punk) and clothing (e.g., outlandish) were prone to like each other and expected to be liked by each other. This worked in both directions: more normative beauty-oriented perceivers (those into "fitness and wellness") specifically tended to like dressed-up (as opposed to outlandishly-dressed) others. No similarity effects were found for other personality traits, interest similarity or self-concept similarity.
Why Are Self-Centered People Attractive At First Sight?
The finding that extroversion is related to popularity at first sight is not surprising. Neither is the finding that those with higher levels of neuroticism and lower levels of self-esteem expect to be unpopular. Prior research by the same researchers (also adopting the Social Relations Lens Model) found that men with a long-term mating orientation (which is correlated with reduced levels of extraversion) and shy men (which is correlated with higher levels of neuroticism) get the short end of the stick in rapid mate-selection settings such as speed dating. Other research has shown that extroverted people fare better in a speed dating context. The reason is pretty straightforward: at first encounter, extroverted people are more likely to reveal their personality than introverts; extroversion acts as an amplifier of human traits. As for those with high levels of neuroticism and low levels of self-esteem, they may come across as more socially anxious and make others feel uncomfortable at first meeting. (Note, however, that the opposite of extroversion is not shyness. Many introverts may not be noticed at first sight, but are OK with that, as they simply aren't as interested in the social stimulation.)
While alarming, the finding that self-centeredness is related to popularity also isn't terribly surprising. Prior research has found that narcissists -- well, actually, the very worst kind of narcissists, those who enjoy exploiting and manipulating others -- are the most popular at first sight (see "Why Are Narcissists (Initially) So Popular?"). In that study, they found that those scoring high in narcissism tended to display the four main components of the "charismatic air": attractiveness (flashy and neat attire), competence (self-assured behavior), interpersonal warmth (charming glances) and humor (witty verbal expressions).
The real world bears this out; everywhere I look, it seems like self-centered people are the most popular. Those with humanitarian ideals are appreciated but aren't flashed across the television screen. This isn't terribly shocking: people seek entertainment, and self-centered people provide entertainment for some people. I'm a fan of Kanye West's music, even though his self-aggrandizement annoys the heck out of me. I've had some self-centered friends in the past, and they could be fun to hang out with.
The most interesting and perhaps surprising thing about the Back and colleagues study is the finding that extroverts are virtually indistinguishable from self-centered individuals at first sight. Both extroverts and self-centered people displayed self-assured body movements and friendly facial expressions and made original self-introductions.
This finding has important implications when it comes to the domain of intimate relationships. How we are perceived at first sight plays a crucial role in mating and dating. I assume most people are attracted to the extroverted aspects of the self-centered individual, not the actual self-centeredness. But how can a person tell the difference without more interactions with that person? This also poses a problem for people who are shy or more introverted. People who aren't flashy and attention-grabbing aren't as popular. This is a shame. I've had quite a number of very meaningful relationships with people who aren't particularly alluring at first but who are awesome people once I've gotten the chance to know them.
A potential criticism of the Back and colleagues study is that it was conducted on college students, and college students aren't representative of the rest of humanity. There is some truth to this: this generation is particularly narcissistic, spending a lot of attention on superficial aspects such as style of dress. Future research should certainly look at a wider range of ages and in a wider range of contexts.
Still, I think their effects do transcend age. In their prior speed dating study, their results, which were consistent, held even after controlling for age (the age range was 18 to 54).
So what are people to do? I think the best advice to everyone is this: before getting too involved with a person, observe them in multiple contexts first, and give people who seem shy or who aren't particularly flashy at first sight a chance. To shy people and introverts who want more social stimulation, I'd suggest working on amplifying your best traits. Whether we like it or not, perception at first sight matters.
