Deadliest Catch star Corey Arnold is a photographer who lives, eats, and sleeps his art- an artist living a truly alternative life. Arnold lives on a fishing boat in the Bering Sea, documenting the lives of the fisherman and workers with whom he shares his boat. His current task: to document the state of the commercial fishing industry in the European Union. His images depict the lives not only of fisherman, but also of their families, communities, processors, shipyards, and netmakers. His stories are fascinating and an inspiration to those artistic dreamers who have strange and adventurous ideas up their sleeves. Read Arnold's first hand accounts, How to Be a European Fisherman Photographer, or How To Be An Alaskan Fisherman on Fecal Face, and check out the slide show below for a look at his life.

Ya gotta hand it to Ralph Lauren. He's just built the first mansion on the Upper East Side since 1918. That's when Otto Kahn put up his capacious squat at Fifth Avenue and 91st Street. It could be said that with the sophisticated Madison Avenue and 72nd Street pad, Lauren has reached the zenith towards which he's aimed himself since the '60s when he started hawking wide ties and Bloomingdale's featured them prominently enough to establish the brand name.
It might also be said that with the structure he's erected, Lauren is something of an arriviste, but if that were uttered, it would require adding that many of the mansions introduced on those soigné avenues were constructed as well by new money confidently joining the old -- like the Rhinelander mansion that's been Lauren's home-base haberdashery for men and women these last few decades.
Strictly speaking, the manses of yore were designed as dwellings, which Lauren's is not. (The in-house architect is John Heist.) So the Lauren version is where he's now housing his women's collections and home furnishings. They're moved from the Rhinelander abode across the street, which is given over exclusively to men's clothes. Viewed from the exterior, however, the edifice echoes the stones of Florence with its take on rusticated stone and its three arches topped with classic balustrade facing Madison Avenue. It sure looks like someplace Mrs. August Belmont might have been happy to visit with the rest of the four hundred.
She hasn't lived to seize the opportunity, but many others did this past weekend, just a few days after "Ralph Lauren" threw open its elegant wrought-iron-and glass doors. The curious ambled through the four floors and up and down the broad marble staircase where the walls are hung with portraits of Greta Garbo, Kate Moss, James Dean, Lisa Fonssagrives (if it isn't Fonssagrives, it's another of Irving Penn's fave models) and others of that photogenic ilk.
Among the inquisitive was this reporter who -- full disclosure -- owns 100 shares of the designer's stock. Yup, I was there to see what this new no-discount outlet might do for my meager holdings one way or the other, but I was also in attendance as a sort of fashionisto manqué.
Whereas most of those ogling the various rooms were gotten up in real or ersatz Polo duds they hoped would pass (and many of the women sported instantly recognizable Botoxed sheen), I had thrown on a nubby mottled black-white-&-gray blazer purchased for $35 several years back at a now-defunct Broadway store; a ribbed gray turtleneck Gap sweater grabbed for eight bucks at a Housing Works Thrift Shop; and gray flannel slacks from Brooks Brothers bought last year in a $148-for-one-$149-for-two deal. So you could say I was wearing the $1 pants -- or pant, in the contemporary vernacular.
Okay, I admit I was trying to look as if I belonged, too, and was gratified when two salespeople -- one in the women's store, one in the men's -- complimented me on the jacket. Were they being sincere? I'm vain enough to think so. And I responded accordingly, just as I appreciated so many salespersons -- all of whom in the women's store wore black -- asking about my health.
But what of that interior, which I learned was designed -- top to bottom, they say -- by in-house staffer Alfredo Paredes? The rooms are swanky as all get-out and, as anyone would surmise, are focused in accordance with what's displayed there -- say, gowns or casual wear. They're also strewn with the objets d'art Lauren is known to favor.
(It must be fun to be one of Lauren's tchotchkes shoppers.)
The merchandise shown reflects the eclectic Polo lad. (Laird?) Everything is stunning, especially the outfits worn by mannequins that languish on benches or lean aloofly against railings or stand defiantly on risers. One floaty floral gown that looked breath-taking on a hanger seemed less effective on a woman emerging from a dressing-room to solicit her male companion's opinion.
The only item that made me stop and wonder was a wool day dress (I think it was wool) with a leather placket that accommodated three buttons and a leather patch at the right shoulder that declared "I'm a gal who needs you to know I shoot a mean quail." Huh! Is Lauren convinced that a woman thus hunt-happy would advertise her pastime this way?
Still, the stroll through the swanky atmosphere had its unmitigated charms for me. Other ostensible shoppers seemed equally pleased -- or at least relaxed enough to carry on comfortable conversations. My favorite over-heard comment was, "I don't want to be on Page Six. Again," which wasn't spoken by departing Page Six coordinator Richard Johnson, but by another smiling fellow, who maybe has been on Page Six many times, or has never been bold-faced there.
Nevertheless, at Ralph Lauren's new showplace, all faces looked bold.

The last 10 years seems to me to have been a long decade. I know that time is supposed to 'speed up' as we get older, but the "Millennium" celebrations, Y2K and all the hype about the 21st century seems like ancient history. A decade ago, we still weren't at war in two countries, 9/11 hadn't happened, George Bush was still promising a bipartisan administration, climate change was still a bit of an arcane scientific debate for most of us, New Orleans was still having a non-stop party and Google was a minor start-up. YouTube didn't exist at the turn of the century, eBay and Amazon were still babies, and the real estate bubble was just beginning. Steve Jobs had recently returned to Apple after spending 13 years with NeXT, the iPod and iTunes were concept just beginning to be developed and the iPhone wasn't even in sight. We were all younger and, I think, generally more optimistic than we are today. We've lost a lot of our innocence in only 10 years. From Al Quaeda to Bernie Madoff, we're waking up to the realization that the world is not our oyster and that the American Dream is just a dream if we aren't responsible for it and act upon it. Personally, I think the saddest thing that has happened to us in the past decade is the political and ideological polarization of our nation. I don't know if it can be recovered and I don't want to speculate on why it happened. Somewhere along the way, being 'right' about our point of view has become more important than community solidarity, prosperity, self-respect, love, or even our future. We've all seen this kind of egocentric "I'm Rightism" between individuals and how it can destroy relationships, fuel family feuds, and spawn conditions of resentment, bitterness and hatred. And now we're seeing it almost everywhere we go constantly being fanned by the "news" channels and on the Internet. It is as deadly as cancer (probably worse, since it infects everyone and can even be passed from one generation to the next). The yearly turnover on the calendar and New Year's Eve has always been my favorite time of the year. It is a kind of post-Christmas reprieve, combined with a 'fresh start' in whatever games we're playing. This is the time for those great retrospectives on who has died and some upbeat generally predictions for the year ahead. I am sure that this year we'll also get the 'decade' retrospective along the lines of what I am doing here. But my point is not the past. My point is to look at what we can do to have the next ten years be about working to manifest a positive vision for America. President Obama campaigned on this idea: within weeks, was being blamed for the mess he inherited and now he is caught up in the same old media-inspired dog fight that guarantees the future will, in all likelihood, be more of the same. The political landscape is far too complex to boil down to a simple indictment like seeing it as being just about money and power. I think the first decade of the 21st century is the breakdown--and hopefully the breakdown before the breakthrough. By this, I mean that we've been living through the near collapse of our financial system, loss of confidence in our personal security, pandemic challenges to our health, a growing breech between the 'haves' and 'have nots', climate change issues that threaten civilization, growing conflicts driven by ethnic and ideologically differences, and the return of deep concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation. The list goes on.... But it is the sheer number of intractable problems that give me some hope. Collectively, they are showing us something about the deeper structure of consciousness (the paradigm) that is giving rise to all of this insanity and unworkability. Specifically, they are revealing our collective mindset, a viewpoint that is based on the ideas that 'people are things' and that survival and success are about control and material advantage. More importantly, they point out that not only are we out of control, but that we also don't have control. We have become addicted to a worldview (just like we can be addicted to a substance). The consequences are the same: eventual self-destruction. These intractable problems are also revealing the possibility that we can 'recover' if we stop and accept that we aren't the center of the Universe and that something larger than ourselves is at work here--a higher power (however we may understand it).
Instead of making New Year's 'resolutions' as we watch our clocks turn over on midnight this December 31st, let's reflect more on who we are. Let's set aside our fear for the moment and rediscover our humility and gratitude for what we do have. And after we sing Auld Lang Syne together, let's add a few prayers to our thoughts--perhaps a prayer of compassion for those who suffer, a prayer for our leaders, and a prayer for everyone who is committed to creating a future that works for all of us.
