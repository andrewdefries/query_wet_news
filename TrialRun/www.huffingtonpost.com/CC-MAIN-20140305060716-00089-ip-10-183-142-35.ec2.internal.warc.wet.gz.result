Weird News
Ray Allen Charron, 37, was arrested on Saturday on charges of strong-arm robbery, battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence.
Looks like his bark was worse than his bite.
Career criminal Ray Allen Charron, 37, was arrested this weekend in Land O' Lakes, Fla. after climbing a tree and engaging in an 11-hour standoff with sheriff's deputies, Fox 13 reported.
Deputies had been pursing Charron on Nov. 16, after a report that he had pushed a man off his bicycle and stolen it. When a deputy tried to question Charron at around 2 p.m., he allegedly tried to fight, then ran away and climbed up a 30-foot tall tree.
Pasco County officials surrounded the tree to try and persuade Charron to come down. He finally surrendered 11 hours later, at around 1 a.m Saturday. The squirrelly character was taken into custody, the Associated Press reports, and charged with strong-arm robbery, battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence.
In 2011, Charron was arrested on assault charges, according to Land O' Lakes Patch. He also faced charges in the past that include assault, robbery felony battery, domestic battery, criminal mischief, contempt of court and operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver's license.

Joshua K. PinneyThis gentleman allegedly tried to commit identify theft while sporting what may be the worst disguise ever. Cops say he was trying to impersonate the man whose picture appeared on a driver's license he had stolen. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/19/joshua-k-pinney-identity-theft_n_1987834.html" target="_blank">Read the whole story here.</a>Domonique PinkardThis alleged robber was found snoozing on the couch of a home that police say he and a friend had just robbed.
When questioned by cops, they say Pinkard told them he needed a nap because he had been "working hard all day."

He really worked at Pizza Hut, but police say he would leave home every morning in a stolen deputy's uniform, then don the uniform again before coming back.
Acquaintances say he would tell stories that occurred "on the job" and even give legal advice.

After he was caught, he bonded out of jail and was arrested a couple of months later for allegedly impersonating a police officer.

Joseph Lawrence Borowiak is charged with strong-arm robbery and resisting arrest after allegedly wrestling a store clerk over a pack of cigarettes. Borowiak reportedly stated, "The king doesn't pay for cigarettes." Nichlous PeternikThe hand of justice makes an appearance in this mug shot. Nichlous Peternik -- and the arm of a law enforcement official in Redding, Calif. -- are featured prominently in this memorable booking photo taken after Peternik was arrested on suspicion of burglary. Officials say they were forced to reach into the frame when Peternik refused to pull his hair back from over his face.Juan AguirreEven if Juan Aguirre got away, he would have ended up empty handed. Police said the 21-year-old Kansan stole six empty DVD boxes from a local adult entertainment shop.Gregory LiascosThis camouflage might work well in nature, but it really stands out in the police station. Oregon investigators believe Gregory Liascos, 36, was wearing this "ghillie" camouflage when he attempted to break into the Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals last week. After setting off alarms, the suspect allegedly fled into a wooded area nearby. Officers only found Liascos when a police dog bit what appeared to be a patch of grass -- which yelped in pain. On Oct. 12, 2011, authorities said Liascos failed to show up for his trial. A warrant has been issued for his arrest.Ranaldo JackAuthorities in Georgia found Ranaldo Jack stuck in a woman's chimney. He was charged in connection with an attempted burglary.
