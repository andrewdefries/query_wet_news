A great night out grooving on the dance floor can result in sore soles and a throbbing tumble out the door. Two British companies are capitalizing on clubgoers' end-of-night anguish by installing shoe vending machines full of cheap flats.
From the website: Rollasoles sell for about GBP 5 and come in four colors: Hi Ho Silver, Gold Digger, and Back to Black and Pink. They sold out immediately in England's popular nightclubs. But Rollasoles don't have a corner on the midnight market:
Afterheels are similar rollable ballet flats that also sell for about GBP 5 but have--according to the company--the added feature of being sustainable; the bodies of the shoes are made from natural materials and the polypropylene insoles are fully recyclable. Each pair is dispensed with a matching bag so women can tote their tortuous footwear home. Or, save your spending money and leave the house in a pair of flats, like Michelle Obama or Carla Bruni-Sarkozy. Would you buy these flats?

Since the smell test doesn't really cut it, we decided to investigate the chemicals in seafood that you might not know about. We all know that mercury is often found in fish and are careful about our mercury consumption but did you know about the presence of pesticides, flame retardants or arsenic in the world's seafood? 2.6 billion people obtain 20 percent of their animal protein from eating seafood. Contaminants leak into the world's water supplies from industrial and municipal waste, storm water runoff and even agricultural practices causing serious environmental, animal and human health issues. Check out our slideshow of seven toxic chemicals in fish that you don't know about. As always, we want to hear from you in the comments.

PBDEs: Flame Retardants	1 of 8
First Slide	Previous Slide	@
PBDEs, a common flame retardant, have been detected in various fish across the West Coast in the United States. A 2006 report from the Environmental Working Group uncovered the flame retardant in Washington rivers and lakes. From 1997 to 2003, levels of PBDEs (prolybrominated diphenyl ethers) doubled in San Francisco Bay fish, such as striped bass and halibut. PBDEs are often used in electronics, furniture, carpets and textiles. The chemicals are traceable in rivers, estuaries, oceans, house dust and water. Animals In The News

Excellent, timely article/slide-show!
I used to enjoy seafood (my holdout "meat", since ethically and health-wise I have an aversion to factory farm products), but I can't bring myself to buy it, now.
It's not just teh over-fishing and depletion of integral elements of the ocean's ecosystem, but also the sense that I'd be swallowing a fish- or lobsetr-flavored cocktail of toxic chemical(s).
When you read about the effects of some of these chemicals (mercury, for instance) on cognitive function, the old zombie movies don't seem quite so far fetched, after all.	Total comments: 146 | Post a Comment

Bart van Olphen: Can We Keep Eating Tuna?
The worldwide fishing capacity is five times more than the legal amount of fish available. We need to accept that a wild-caught fish has become a rare food product. Robert Redford: Mr. President: Now Is the Time For Clean Energy
I am glad that President Obama announced that he would appoint an independent commission to look at the causes of the blow out. But it is not enough.	Shannyn Moore: Palin Matchmakes For a Gasline; A Deal With The Devil
Governor Sarah Palin is sleeping with the enemy of many Alaskans. Her trip to Texas to discuss a merged project with TransCanada and Exxon Mobil betrays Alaskans. Susan Buchanan: Feds to Add Dispersant Test to Seafood Safety Tools
The Gulf fish you ate recently may have tasted fine but you might have wondered if it was tested for the dispersant COREXIT -- used by BP to break oil into smaller pieces.	Gina Solomon: The Gulf Oil Spill and Seafood Safety
In the coming weeks, expect that many more areas will reopen to fishing. The unprecedented enormity of this oil spill makes it difficult to predict the extent and duration of fish contamination. Nikolas Kozloff: Oil and Cultural Genocide: From the Amazon to the Gulf
Reporters have ignored a crucial aspect of the BP spill: cultural extermination and the plight of indigenous peoples. Giles Slade: Did BP Do Us a Favor?
At last, there is a visible environmental crisis caused by our obsession with oil-based energy. It is impossible to dismiss or to spin. This time there aren't going to be any "oil spill deniers."	What's Your Reaction?

NASA has released a spectacular video, recorded by the Expedition 30 crew aboard the International Space Station, that gives us Earth-bound residents a view of Earth unlike any other.
The video highlights man-made, astronomical, and meteorological features in a series of time-lapse photographs set to Howard Blake's other-worldly song "Walking in the Air."
The video includes city lights over Europe and the U.S., colorful views of both the Aurora Borealis and the Aurora Australis, stars over the southern U.S., a setting moon, and a blue comet (Lovejoy). From a weather perspective, there are some great shots of cloud formations from a different perspective than the typical satellite image, along with the sparkling nighttime thunderstorms from outer space.
The video would make a great recruiting tool for astronauts!

How did Pearson, which claims to have checkpoints "built into the process to ensure consistent progress in achieving school improvement goals," attempt to establish the validity of the Atlanta school district's claims for off-the-charts improvement on test scores before taking credit for the results?

North Carolina Bill Targets Teachers A top North Carolina lawmaker has introduced several education reform measures du jour -- including one that would end tenure -- reports the News & Observer. "Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger on Tuesday unveiled what he called the second round of education reforms aimed at holding schools and teachers more accountable for students' progress - including ending tenure and grading entire schools," the N & O reports. Last year, he introduced the same bill. But this time around, Republicans hold a veto-proof majority, so one never knows.

When we grant subsidies to large corporations, or bail out the financial leaders who led our economy to the brink, we don't ask the recipients of social largess to take semi-annual drug tests. We only mistrust the poor folks who are the victims of an increasingly inequitable society.

Netflix Reauthorizes No Child Left Behind? Or so quips this EdWeek headline. Real-life Congress hasn't yet reauthorized NCLB (since 2007!), but characters on the Netflix series "House of Cards" do. "[Writer Beau] Willimon noted on Twitter that he hinged the plot on education because it affects us all directly and indirectly, and because of the contention that often revolves around education reform," EdWeek writes. Read the full story for a taste of which education fights the show covers. My take: Obviously TV isn't reality, but there are a few major inaccuracies. The most glaring one in my eyes is that teachers unions can't legally hold a national strike over some federal legislation they dislike!
