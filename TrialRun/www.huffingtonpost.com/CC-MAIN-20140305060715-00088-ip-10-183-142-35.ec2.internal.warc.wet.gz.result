It's official: Bangs are back. With some of our favorite stars -- including Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lawrence and Carly Rae Jepsen -- rocking a fringe, it seems that more and more celebs are getting on the bangs bandwagon. The latest convert is "X Factor" judge Demi Lovato, who tweeted a photo of her new -- and very blonde -- haircut last night. The star said: @ddlovato

Guess what's back, back, back, back again..... BANGS are back, back, back tell your friends.... http://t.co/PpDLaaVP

With her platinum blonde topknot, gold jewelry and flannel shirt, we couldn't help but be reminded of Miley's recent style update. (Could you see Demi going super short, as well?)
Check out @ddlovato's new 'do in the slideshow below, and click through the photos for more hair-spiration from your favorite fringed celebs. Do you like Demi's new look? Who do you think rocks a fringe best? Tell us in the comments below or tweet @HuffPostTeen! Loading Slideshow

The First Civilian Deaths in the Obama Administration; What do they Say About "Proportionality?"

You know you're president when you lay your hand on the bible and take (and then actually re-take, the oath).
You know you're president when you dance at ten inaugural balls, and the song you've chosen is re-born as a kind of new national anthem.
You know you're president when that thing they call the "football" is never far away.
But you really know it when the first innocent people die on your watch.
On Friday, President Obama's administration approved the use of unmanned military drones in an attack on Taliban insurgents in Laghman Province, in the mountainous region between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The New York Times reports that "The outrage over civilian deaths swelled again over the weekend. Hundreds of angry villagers demonstrated here...after an American raid on a village in the province on Friday night. The raid killed at least 16 villagers, including 2 women and 3 children, according to a statement from President Hamid Karzai."
On his third full day in office, President Obama didn't back down from his campaign commitment to pursue the war in Afghanistan with unflagging intensity. Those critics who thought they were dealing with a Viet Nam-era dove who'd be reluctant to use force, have got another guess coming. The President has been getting the same daily national security briefing as the former president ever since the election. He's had time to consult with his policy experts and make a decision about whether this was a course of action he wanted to continue, or not. Friday speaks for itself.
And it was the right thing to do. But was it "proportionate" -- using the buzzword of the moment?
The Taliban are gaining strength in Afghanistan, controlling ever-larger swaths of territory, and as the Times noted yesterday, terrorizing villagers with the same kind of fanatical brutality that they wielded when they ran the joint.
But they're not directly threatening American non-combatants. Our attack wasn't in self-defense; the Taliban isn't massed on our border. They'd not indiscriminately lobbing missiles, on a daily basis, into Los Angeles or Chicago or Dallas. But President Obama approved the unleashing of the drones, recognizing that there was a high probability civilians would be killed, including women and children.
There's analogue I'm obviously pursuing, and that analogue is the situation in Gaza. The Israelis are faced with similar decisions every day, given how inseparable Hamas has made itself from ordinary Gazans. So similar, in fact that, a U.S. military spokesman -- in explaining the situation on the ground -- could very well have been someone from the IDF: "In a statement, Colonel O'Hara said "... the enemy placed the village in harm's way by operating the way they do." He "added that care had been taken not to use air power inside the village, to avoid civilian casualties. He dismissed the villagers' accounts that they had mistaken the soldiers for thieves. 'I am not buying that,' he said. 'These people were acting as sentries.'"
In Gaza as in Afghanistan, the lines between insurgents and civilians are intentionally blurred. In deciding to continue the Bush policies, President Obama implicitly recognized this: amoral guerrilla fighting puts civilians at risk. Critics of Israel could argue equally well that President Obama displayed a lack of "proportionality": you shouldn't expose innocent people to death unless there's a clear and present danger to American troops. And the ferocity of the assault should be balanced by both the enemy's aggressiveness at that particular moment, and the risk to civilians.
But like the Israelis, President Obama recognizes that "proportionality" requires a longer term view. The score is not tallied up at the end of a given day. Action is taken for a variety of reasons - to eliminate a specific target, to send a message, to destroy supply lines. Any or all of them have civilian implications. Proportionality is a big-picture calculus.
Our raid on Friday killed Gul Pacha -- a Taliban leader who was nicknamed "Al Qaeda" by locals. But villagers "criticized the United States forces for killing his elderly father and two sons along with him, and for the shooting of other villagers."
It's a sad and complex business. Like the Israelis, we score a military victory but further alienate a population -- a population that is sometimes coerced into cooperation, but is often volitionally complicit as well. Yes, I think both the Israelis and the Palestinians are psychologically trapped in a vicious stand-off which is beyond the cure of combat. But the fury of the international judgment against Israel, and the unrestrained anti-Zionism, is itself not proportionate.
President Obama is a thoughtful and moral man who reads Reinhold Niebuhr. Based on the briefings he gets -- and believe me, he pushes back on every assumption unlike his predecessor -- he determined that the American action on Friday was within the contours of a proportionate response, and that the Taliban are the accountable parties.
Given that, perhaps the knee-jerk opponents of any Israeli self-defense, the self-appointed draftsmen of proportionality, will take a fresh look at when military action -- even at the risk of innocent life -- is a tragic but necessary outcome for which others hold the ultimate responsibility.

I believe that in this "School of Life" we are here to learn lessons. There are many life lessons for us to embrace before we "graduate." This is precisely why we signed on for this earthly journey. We wanted to grow to be more loving, more tolerant, less addicted, etc. We find ourselves in designated situations giving us the options we need for our spiritual growth. Each one of us is on his/her own individual path, following a prescribed "lesson plan" just for us. It's our own "Divine Design." To compare ourselves to others or to judge others' situations along our way, is moot. Although not the same path, all roads lead to the Father's house.
Our life is made up of choices, small choices we make everyday to become a better person and to become a better earth-citizen. And if by some chance we miss an opportunity to learn and grow, Life, in its all-loving wisdom, will give us second chances until we "GET IT." Example: As I was on my morning walk I noticed a dirty plastic cup on my path. I glanced at it as I walked by rationalizing that I didn't want to get my hands dirty carrying around this germ-infested cup. Totally missing the opportunity to be a "good citizen" I continued on my merry way. About 30 minutes later I almost fell over a beer can directly in my way. I would have to hurdle over it to miss this one. I had to laugh as I picked it up FINALLY getting the lesson. This is a very simplistic story to illustrate the larger picture. God will give us as many learning opportunities, and maybe even many lifetimes, to learn the lessons that we signed on for. Recurring events and situations are presented before us, time after time, under many disguises, offering us the same lesson to pick up on. If we are numb to the Lesson Plan, the Universe may intensify the situations, trying to awaken us to the learning opportunity. We may find ourselves in seemingly unbearable situations, stretching us sometimes thinking that this is more than we can handle. All the grandiose plans that we had on the other side before we incarnated for spiritual growth sound so good "over there" but when we get "down here" in the halls of the "School of Life," it seems overwhelming. We question: Why is this happening to me? Why does life have to be this painful? Take the time to go to the Wisdom Within reflecting on the lesson to be learned.
On a smaller daily scale there may be certain people who get under your skin and cause you to respond with short, curt, sarcastic remarks or perhaps you avoid these individuals altogether. This is time for reflection. Take a step back and ask yourself, "Why?" Why is this person is my life "bothering me"? What is the life lesson that this situation is teaching me? This particular situation or person may be calling for your practice of tolerance or forgiveness. Admittedly some demanding, impatient individuals can bring out the worst in us, but remember these "obstacles" were put in front of us as invitations; invitations for checking off another of life's lessons. Remember even the pain-in-the-neck people are actually working with you and for you. Put on your "heaven-tinted glasses" viewing situations in the bigger picture. As we muddle through life we may not see particular situations for what they really are -- opportunities for growth.
In the process of writing "A Change of Habit," I was overwhelmed at the many missed opportunities to learn the lesson of "where is God?" Actually documenting my story in black and white was humbling. I kept looking for Him "outside" when all the time He was "inside." Time after time, I didn't "GET IT." I think I may be a slow leaner. Writing the book about the 40 years of my spiritual journey gave me ample invitations to look in the rear view mirror and see how the pieces of the puzzle finally come together for the best of Life's lessons. Trust that Life will give you exactly what you need. I pray everyday that I will learn my lessons in this life quickly and easily. I don't want to repeat this grade. Do you really think that life would be much lovelier the second time around?

Loneliness... from the mind it triggers reflection, from the heart it asks for change, from the soul it pleads for mercy. A mystery at times, loneliness can be one of the most powerful emotions you can painfully and silently endure. It creeps into your soul unexpectedly, whether due to a gesture, a comment or a circumstance, and it hits home hard without warning. As the key to many opened and closed doors, it's the fuel that drives things to happen; it triggers you to do the crazy, the surprising, what you'd never consider doing. From buying a dog to accepting a blind date, the list of pastimes loneliness creates tolerates little or no boundaries. And like a power surge that runs through your veins, loneliness awakens your senses and drugs you with sadness and joy that emerge from the same coin of this ageless emotion. Without loneliness, life ceases to exist. And as an emotion that makes us aware of life's great value, loneliness lives, breathes and exists in all of us, whether we like it or not. But hush, don't tell anyone. After all, no one wants to admit he's lonely -- at least not openly. And yet, don't they? As years have passed, so has our relationship with loneliness. The lonely are no longer playing hide-and-seek in the dark. Loneliness has set our egos further aside, allowing us to open up, reconsider, imagine and be creative about ourselves, others and life decisions. Take dating sites. Creativity with online connections has become the new craze. Perhaps, once thought of as a subscription to a social taboo or a desperate attempt to end one's loneliness, signing up for dating sites has come to be a "matter-of-fact" thing to do. As part of the social media craze, dating site profiles continue to grow daily and so rapidly that they're taking over the world of the lonely near and far. No longer solely reserved for the single, "lonely" now labels the widowed, divorced and even the married. People continue to seek human connections, be it meaningful or meaningless, from every corner of their lives because we live in a lonely world where lonely people breed one-night stands, first-date kisses, love-at-first-sight whims, affairs to remember or hide, and wild imaginations that may end nowhere. Social networking has become a way of life for all, the adult and child alike. Can you stop a precocious five-year-old from creating his Facebook profile when friends have the same online? Think again, as guess what? He's got friends, lots of them, including his teacher. And creating the impossible or unbelievable with just a click allows for the partial, if not sometimes total, fulfillment of one's feelings of loneliness. It's no wonder you'll find people reading self-help pages on how to connect with others, sending a friend request to a stranger, entering a chat room or updating their Twitter accounts. Thanks to loneliness, we have more choices and outlets. So the question is this: what's so bad about feeling lonely? It seems that it's not so bad after all. While communications are often lost, and while real connections are hardly ever made amidst the crazy world of networking, socializing and scheming to find love, comfort, companionship or anything even remotely similar, the case for loneliness should be a positive one, as it leaves room for hope. If loneliness didn't exist, would friendships, families, marriages or partnerships exist? Would you be willing to adopt that high-maintenance dog, reconsider the guy you never gave a second thought to, or sign up for that formerly-known silly dance class? I'm not so sure. Life's a bitch. I say that thanks to loneliness, we don't have go at it alone, at least not most of the time. Loneliness can create wonders like love stories, second chances, best friends and great possibilities. Use loneliness wisely and to your benefit; then you may just find what you're yearning.

If you ever dreamed of witnessing a master in the midst of the creative process, perhaps Brian Wilson with his toes submerged in a makeshift sandbox beneath Van Dyke Parks' Chickering & Sons piano as he toiled over the verses to "Surf's Up," or maybe hanging about whilst Paul Williams composed a bank commercial jingle which grew into The Carpenters' pop standard "We've Only Just Begun" -- you're in luck. Behold the return of an evolving artist of renown guitar virtuoso John Ashton, whom you should remember from the iconic and sorely missed original Psychedelic Furs. When the Furs first assaulted the American rock 'n' roll (there is no such genre as "post-punk") conscious with their underground radio hymn "Pretty In Pink" at a time when Bonzo Reagan and Iron Lady Thatcher were setting the stage for the world we live in to go terribly wrong, the torch of prodigious and distinctive singer-guitarist duos which passed from Daltrey/Townshend to Bowie/Ronson founds its way to Messrs, Richard Butler and John Ashton. If you missed the Furs the first time around, do your homework -- then go figure out why their seven essential studio albums still sound as fresh and vital as they did the day they came out. Akin to his celebrated contemporaries Johnny Marr and The Edge, John Ashton is that rare breed of guitar player whom you can identify in a single note or chord. After years of settling in the producer's chair, occasional cameos, demos, sessions and downtime for family, Mr. Ashton is at the heart of making his long-awaited return as a recording artist under the collective banner of Satellite Paradiso. "This journey started almost 20 years ago," enthuses Ashton, who fell in love with upstate New York when the Furs arrived to record with a local wizard and true star, Todd Rundgren, in the early 1980s. "We were a bunch of urbanite Londoners -- to us, coming to the Catskills was like walking into a Rip Van Winkle story." Ashton, happily married with two children, has resided in Woodstock since the Furs wound down in the 1990s. (Note: The Psychedelic Furs have since reconvened and continue to tour the nostalgia circuit sans Ashton.) With the demise of record labels and music retail as Ashton and previous generations knew it - Satellite Paradiso comes to you by way of Pledge Music: a grassroots platform which has also been utilized by Slash, Ben Folds Five, Johnny A and Minus the Bear, among others. The modus operandi is simple -- you the fan support the Ashton, the artist. There are several levels of pledges with perks, ranging from discs, to vinyl, posters, artwork, garb, autographed guitars and for Lottery winners and those of you in the one percent -- a private acoustic concert! As such Mr. Ashton has free artistic reign -- no suits, no creative limitations, no problem. I've done this album pretty much in a Woodstock way wherein you cobble whatever equipment you have, set up the mics, invite people over, and hope for the best! Over the years I started writing songs and it came together little by little.Collaborative recommendations from Ashton's long-time friend Rob Sacher (his book Wake Me When It's Over: My Life as a New York Rock Club Owner is essential reading) plus well-known neighbors dropping by to lend a hand, chance meetings, along with a little help from familiar faces has serendipitously shaped an all-star ensemble for the ages: guitarist Cheetah Chrome (Dead Boys, Rocket From the Tombs); Mercury Rev's Anthony Molina and Jonathan Donahue; drummer/pianist Frank Coleman; vocalists Fred Schreck (The Ancients, Crush) and Mark Volman (The Turtles, Frank Zappa, T.Rex); bassists Sara Lee (Gang of Four, B-52s) and Gail Ann Dorsey (David Bowie, Lenny Kravitz); drummer Paul Ferguson from Killing Joke; and assorted Furs alumni Duncan Kilburn and Mars Williams (sax), Roger Morris (guitar, keys), Paul Garisto and Don Yallech (drums) and Amanda Kramer (piano, keys) -- just to name a few. Among the most riveting aspects of Satellite Paradiso is Ashton's frequent routine of sharing fascinating and insightful updates of his work-in-progress via social media and his website: from showing fans Lou Reed's old recording board to a fly-on-the-wall video of Chrome rendering wicked guitar parts from an open-air iPhone on a killer cut entitled "Bad Blood." Previews of Satellite Paradiso tracks including "Insomnia," "Touch the Sky," and "Angelic" find Ashton pushing the sonic boundaries he forged a generation ago. And his penchant for anthemic melodies is as strong as it ever was. No wonder Mr. Ashton has a difficult time containing his passion. This is something I've wanted to do for years! It's great that I am on familiar ground with people I've worked with before such as Duncan and Roger who played on Talk Talk and the first Furs' album... and to play with Sara, Gail, and people I had not worked with previously has really put a new spin on what I am doing. Satellite Paradiso has taken on this concept to mega proportions. I never expected it to be going the way it has, taking off like a mothership that is hovering and ready to clear the tower! I am totally blessed to have all these people on board.Mr. Ashton has yet to decide when, where and how Satellite Paradiso will appear in the flesh once the record is complete. "This is definitely not a studio-only project... I want to take this on the road with a core band, possibly some festivals and interesting one-offs." The elder statesman is still ahead of his time.----------

Years ago, I went to a garage sale and loaded a cardboard box with old kitchen gadgets, pots, pans and even an old oil tin from the basement of the sale. When I arrived home, I noticed that the muffin tin uncharacteristically had 8 sections. It would make the perfect holder for 8 potatoes for the latke mobile menorah that I decided to create. I used an old croquet trolley to mount the muffin tin, pots, pans, whisks, strainers, and twisted an old candelabra to make an arm held high to hold the shamas. Looking through the utensils, I found a Star of David cookie cutter which I incorporated as well, and interpreted as meaning "yes, all this unrelated junk was meant to be a menorah."
Even though my menorah is dedicated to the latke, the symbolic fried food that I make for chanukah comes from my Hungarian roots: langos.
Langos (pronounced LAN-go-sh)
As a shortcut, go to the supermarket and buy uncooked pizza dough. Let it rise once at room temperature, then form into discs about 6 inches round and a third of an inch high. Heat about one inch of cooking oil, such as canola oil, in a frying pan until hot. Place the discs of dough in the frying pan and cook both sides until brown and puffy. In Hungary, it is served as a savory delight so sprinkle with coarse salt and pepper, some people like to rub it with garlic. As a Canadian treat, omit salt and pepper and serve it with maple syrup for the Chanukah celebrants to dunk.
