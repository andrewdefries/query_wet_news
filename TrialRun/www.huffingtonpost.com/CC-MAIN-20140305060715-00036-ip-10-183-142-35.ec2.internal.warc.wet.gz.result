2011 was a very -- watch out, here it comes -- out-of-this-world year for UFOs. Every month of the year gave us UFO stories to digest, wonder about, or laugh at -- depending on your point of view or belief about UFOs.
Ancient UFOs; scores of videos and photographs; military and government officials offering credible testimony; thousands of pages of previously classified documents; disk and dorito-shaped craft; an official state highway marker erected to commemorate the most widely publicized UFO abduction story in history; petitions sent to the White House asking the Obama administration to release all UFO information; an alleged alien spaceship hiding near the planet Mercury; an ET reportedly photographed standing in a Brazilian rainforest; and a theologian who says religious believers are ready to share a pew with aliens.
These and much more were all there for the taking. With the proliferation of so many video cameras and phone cams, it's not surprising that, according to the Mutual UFO Network -- the largest privately funded UFO research organization in the world -- there were 67 percent more reports of unidentified flying objects in 2011, compared to 2008.
As 2012 looms with the promise of a new year of UFO events -- where believers hope the government will finally acknowledge that some UFOs are extraterrestrial vehicles -- let's step into the wayback machine and re-visit the top 11 UFO stories of 2011.
CHECK OUT THE TOP 11 UFO STORIES OF 2011: (story continues following slideshow)
Number 11: J. Edgar Hoover's FBI Took UFOs Seriously
1 of 14
FIRST SLIDE
PREVIOUS SLIDE
NEXT SLIDESHOW
In early April, the FBI created a new website, The Vault, which gives the public an opportunity to view documents in an online "electronic reading room." Some of the 2,000-plus documents are about UFOs. While the U.S. government has always maintained UFOs don't warrant any serious investigation, documents from the late 1940s indicate FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's interest in UFOs. Pictured is a 1947 document sent by a Wisconsin agent to Hoover, concerning a small, disc-shaped object found at a fairground that contained a photoelectric cell, electric motor and a propeller. While agents felt it was "made by some juvenile," it's noteworthy that they felt it important enough to inform Hoover about it.

Wow, a truly amazing year for UFO believers, skeptics and those in-between.
With the first annual Women's UFO Symposium scheduled for May 2012 in Texas, we can't wait to see what else the new year has in store for us.
Keep looking to the skies and collecting those pictures and videos!

The royal wedding has sparked some quirky trends this year. We've seen everything from a flux of super cheap replicas of Kate Middleton's blue sapphire ring to people even going under the knife to get Pippa's perfect rump, but no fad has been quite as eye-catching as the fascinator. Princess Beatrice's hideous headgear aside, the Philip Treacy stunners that we spotted amongst wedding guests have inspired many celebs stateside to take a go at the daring trend. From Sarah Jessica Parker's, er, interesting topper that she wore in Australia to Madonna's Super Bowl headpiece, these millinery wonders have been perched atop some notable heads this year. Even Kim Kardashian has had a bit of royal wedding nostalgia. The divorcee donned her own headband-meets-hat to Perez Hilton's birthday bash last month. Unfortunately, if any celebs plan on rubbing shoulders with the queen at the Royal Ascot, they'll have to leave their new accessory at home. Check out our gallery below of some of the best--and strangest--fascinators on non-nobles in 2011. Here's to another year of marriage and perplexing headgear! Anna Dello Russo

As Danny Shea, Sam Stein, and others are well documenting, Keith Olbermann's suspension is getting a ton of attention. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee is organizing the public to do something about it. In just a few hours, 50,000, 75,000, 100,000, 200,000 MSNBC viewers signed our petition saying:
"Keith Olbermann made your network a success. If you want your viewers to keep tuning in to MSNBC, put Keith back on TV now!" Sign here - keep the momentum going! Literally thousands of people have shared the petition on Facebook and Twitter, including Michael Moore who Tweeted, "Sign this emergency petition to @msnbc to put @KeithOlbermann back on the air." The petition's now on Reddit too.
In our email to PCCC members announcing the petition, we pointed out the irony of this move -- given this week's election:
The Democratic Party sadly saw this week what happens when you alienate your base. Tell MSNBC that if they want to keep their viewers, they must put Keith back on the air NOW! This is a no-brainer. Keith was one of the only people speaking truth to power for years -- and we need to speak truth to power now, for him. Sign the petition today -- then tell your friends.

In terms of memorable opening lines, I'm not sure any author can top Vladimir Nabokov in Lolita for pure poetry and mind-bending eroticism, but Nabokov's masterful conjuring doesn't leave much to the imagination. He infiltrates the reader's consciousness, making clear from the get-go that the mad white heat of obsession is what's to come. Not so Ayn Rand, whose Atlas Shrugged commences with a tease, a question -- "Who is John Galt?" This intriguing query recurs throughout the novel, sending the heroine and the reader on a mission of discovery, which results in both a love story and an explication of Rand's compelling, but divisive philosophy of Objectivism. Well, enough of the literary lecturing. I hope that my title at least got your wheels turning. Are you ready now to learn a man's essence? For we are here today to talk about Jack Ryan ... or are we? I could divulge that Jack's a bit of an international man of mystery. He certainly does live "abroad." I know his country, even his county, of origin. I've seen imagery that suggests a family life, signs of generosity towards strangers, an infectious likability, and a quick and wicked wit. We share one friend, who is the soul of great fun or "cracker" to use a Jackism. Yet, are words ever enough to capture what lies at the heart of another sentient being? Does it even matter if Jack exists? Could he simply be the invention of our mutual friend, as a lark perhaps, or as an emblem of possibility -- the possibility of finding humor and delight in an individual one does not know?
Every relationship we form is an act of exploration, a groping in the dark as we rub the walls for a light switch. We test and we hope. We ride the wave of initial excitement into the glide of communion or the crash of lost footing. I hope Jack and I survive. It's been a week together on Facebook now. Our mutual friend is someone I actually do know. It's been over four years since we first met and got thrown out of a restaurant together (is that better or worse than being expelled from a bar?). We were talking the other day about life's ups and downs and the difficulty choices often present. I rather flippantly said, "nothing's forever," thinking that would be a comfort to uncertainty. "Our friendship is," he responded. And that, given that history and future will always have tribulations, is the true comfort.
I watched a Werner Herzog documentary the other night, in which the filmmaker lamented there are no new lands to discover. He is wrong. There are millions of them. Indeed, no man is an island. Friend me.
