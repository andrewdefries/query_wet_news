Gay Voices News
Liberace's lover Scott Thorson has come forward with shocking claims he had an affair with Michael Jackson. As Entertainment Tonight is reporting, Thorson said he and Jackson had an intimate relationship in the early 1980s, shortly before the King of Pop's seminal "Thriller" album debuted. "Michael and I had a relationship that...would cross the boundaries," Thorson, 54, revealed in an exclusive interview with Entertainment Tonight's Christina McLarty. When McLarty asked if the relationship had ever been sexual, Thorson added, "That's about all I'm comfortable in saying. We were both young, we both liked each other, we had a lot of fun. We went all over Europe together. Michael was my best friend, I was his best friend."
Thorson previously revealed details of his intimate friendship with Jackson in his 1988 book "Behind the Candleabra: My Life With Liberace," which is currently being made into a movie starring Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. In the interview, he also speaks frankly about how his drug addiction destroyed his five-year relationship with Liberace, who was 44 years his senior. Liberace died of AIDS at the age of 67 in 1987. Watch the full interview here. Take a look at other celebrities who've faced rumors about their sexuality below: Loading Slideshow
Jeremy Renner The hunky star of "The Avengers" blasted persistent rumors about his sexuality -- as well as probes into his personal life in general -- earlier this month. "I want my personal life to be personal, and it's not f***ing true," Renner, 41,<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/04/jeremy-renner-blasts-gay-rumors_n_1403859.html" target="_hplink"> is quoted as saying</a>. "And I don't care if you're talking about things that are true, you're still talking about my personal life.. How about I go peek in your window, take what underwear you wore last night, whose husband you were f***ing, and shove that in the megaphone throughout your neighborhood? How does that feel?"Kristin Stewart In 2009, gossip sites went wild with headlines that suggested the "Twilight" star was a lesbian. However, a closer look at Stewart's quotes <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/6508461/Twilight-star-Kristen-Stewart-on-dating-Robert-Pattinson-We-are.-We-arent.-Im-a-lesbian.html" target="_hplink">reveals how she was actually responding to a question </a>over the nature of her relationship with co-star Robert Pattinson: <blockquote>"I've thought about this a lot. There's no answer that's not going to tip you one way or the other. Think about every hypothetical situation. 'OK, we are. We aren't. I'm a lesbian.' I probably would've answered if people hadn't made such a big deal about it. But I'm not going to give the finding an answer."</blockquote>Jessie J. The British pop star, who is openly bisexual,<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/19/jessie-j-lesbian-rumors-biography-_n_1438372.html" target="_hplink"> faced allegations in an unauthorized biography</a> that she'd been ordered to withhold the fact that she was a lesbian by her record label.
"Jessie might have been with boys in the past -- but she is 100 per cent gay," author Chloe Govan <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/thevoice/4265487/Voice-coach-Jessie-Js-100-gay-but-bi-is-more-trendy.html" target="_hplink">wrote in an excerpt of the book</a>. "Jessie was openly lesbian and didn't hide it."
The singer <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jessiejofficial/status/192975509381066752" target="_hplink">quickly took to Twitter</a> to deny the accusations, noting, "I'm really a lesbian?! Ha! Thanks for writing yet another boring untrue story."James Franco The 21st century actor, artist, intellectual and overall "renaissance man" has believably played gay characters onscreen numerous times (most memorably as Harvey Milk's lover in the Oscar-winning "Milk"), but Franco <a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/01/05/james-franco-gay-roles/" target="_hplink">has downplayed the rumors</a> about his real-life sexuality. "There are lots of other reasons to be interested in gay characters than wanting myself to go out and have sex with guys," he is quoted by <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> as saying. Mike 'The Situation' SorrentinoThe "Jersey Shore" star reportedly hit back at housemates Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi and Jenni "JWoww" Farley after they speculated about his sexuality and hinted he might be gay in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/07/jersey-shore-snooki-and-jwoww-bisexual-feminism_n_1255913.html" target="_hplink">an interview with HuffPost Gay Voices</a>.
"Mike really ripped both Snooki and JWoww a new one," a show insider <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/10514733-421/situation-to-snooki-and-jwoww-stop-hinting-that-im-gay.html" target="_hplink">told <em>The Chicago Sun-Times</a></em>. Noting that Sorrentino is concerned such comments could hurt his brand endorsements, which are focused on straight male customers, the source added, "He's extremely upset."
In the interview, both JWoww and Snooki implied that despite his playboy reputation, Mike has questioned his own sexuality. "He brings it up," JWoww said. "He'll say, 'People think I'm gay and I don't know what they're talking about.'" Added Snooki: "He told me one time, '[All the talk is] making me wonder.'"Bruno MarsRumors that the pop star had come out of the closet began after CNN iReport -- a subsection of the media outlet comprising 'citizen journalists' from around the world -- <a href="http://www.towleroad.com/2012/04/bruno-mars-did-not-come-out-of-the-closet.html" target="_hplink">posted a since-removed story</a> that stated, "The famous pop-star Bruno Mars admits his homosexuality," which caused the Mars' name to trend on Twitter.
Nonetheless, Mars' rep called the report "completely fabricated" and "false," <a href="http://www.gossipcop.com/bruno-mars-gay-out-of-closet-homosexual-april-2012/" target="_hplink">according to Gossip Cop</a>.Hulk Hogan In an appearance on "The Wendy Williams Show," Hulk Hogan <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/09/hulk-hogan-gay-rumors-wendy-williams_n_1265982.html" target="_hplink">responded to accusations made by his ex-wife Linda</a> that he had an affair with fellow wrestler Brutus Beefcake.
"It's tough because a lot of my friends in normal life, a lot of my friends in the entertainment business, and a lot of my friends in the wrestling business are gay," he told Wendy Williams. He continued, "Just to say something spiteful and hurtful, I don't get it...if it was true and I was gay, I'd embrace it, and I'd tell you guys about it and I'd celebrate it."
Tom Cruise Despite three high-profile marriages, the "Top Gun" star has been the subject of gay speculation for years. In 2003, he won a $10 million default judgment in a case against a gay porn actor who claimed the two had an affair, and two years earlier, he sued Los Angeles-based publisher Michael Davis for $100 million after Davis claimed to have a videotape of Cruise engaged in homosexual acts. As <em>People</em> <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,625389,00.html" target="_hplink">reported</a>, the suit was eventually dropped, and Davis eventually stated that Cruise "is not, and never has been, homosexual and has never had a homosexual affair." Oprah Winfrey Speculation has swirled over the talk show queen's long-standing kinship with TV anchor friend Gayle King for years. But as Winfrey <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-12-08/gossip/27083713_1_oprah-winfrey-network-gayle-king-stedman-graham" target="_hplink">told Barbara Walters last year</a>, "I'm not even kind of a lesbian. And the reason why [the rumor] irritates me is because it means that somebody must think I'm lying. That's No. 1. No. 2 ... why would you want to hide it? That is not the way I run my life."
Vin Diesel When <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/news/Diesel_Slams_Gay_Rumors/3487636" target="_hplink">asked about the long-standing rumors</a> on his sexuality, the "Fast And The Furious" star proclaimed, "I was like, 'How could you say that? Why would you say that?'" He went on to note, "I'm not gonna put it out there on a magazine cover like some other actors. I come from the Harrison Ford, Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino code of silence. I'm not gonna do that."
Kelly Clarkson Appearing on "The View," the pop star lamented the fact that she's never been in love and has difficulty dating, which <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/27/kelly-clarkson-denies-lesbian-rumors-on-the-view_n_1034814.html" target="_hplink">prompt many people to speculate that she's a lesbian</a>. "I'm from a small town so, like, everyone's married with children or about to have children," she said. "So it's a little hard when you go home and people are like -- and that's why people think I'm gay -- because they're like 'Why aren't you married?' And I'm like, 'it doesn't happen for everyone right off the bat.'"Tom Hardy The "Inception" hunk <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/28/inception-star-tom-hardy_n_662907.html" target="_hplink">sent the blogosphere into overdrive</a> after he was quoted as saying, "I'm an actor for f**k's sake. I've played with everything and everyone." Still, a source now claims Hardy, who is engaged to British actress Charlotte Riley, <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/the_awful_truth/tom_hardy_source_sex_quotes_taken_out/192935" target="_hplink">had been taken out of context</a>: "He was discussing a gay role and quotes coming from the character." George Clooney After <em>Esquire</em> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/03/08/george-clooney-responds-t_n_90530.html" target="_hplink">uncovered a website</a> that referred to the Oscar-winning hunk as "gay, gay, gay," the good-natured actor quipped, "No, I'm gay, gay. The third gay -- that was pushing it." Friend Manuele Malenotti <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8622173/George-Clooney-gay-rumours-are-untrue-claims-friend.html" target="_hplink">has also defended Clooney</a>, noting, "You never know in life, and men are having an identity crisis but I can tell you George is not gay. All I can say is that George, when it comes to love, has decided that he is not going to get married again and he is not going to have any children and he won't change his mind."The 'Gossip' Guys Tabloid speculation over the button-handsome young stars of "Gossip Girl" has been rampant, <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/06/chace_crawford_and_ed_westwick.html" target="_hplink">particularly given the fact </a>that Chace Crawford (right) and Ed Westwick (middle) were roommates for some time, according to <em>New York Magazine</em>. Westwick <a href="It's funny because I love this f**king dude dearly. I would die for this f**king dude. He's my brother. But, by God, we are so into our f**king women it's ridiculou" target="_hplink">later blasted the rumors</a>, saying, "It's funny because I love this f**king dude dearly. I would die for this f**king dude. He's my brother. But, by God, we are so into our f**king women it's ridiculous." Michelle Rodriguez When asked earlier this year if there <a href="http://www.afterellen.com/people/2011/03/michelle-rodriguez-wants-you-to-know-shes-not-a-lesbian" target="_hplink">were any rumors she wanted to clear up</a>, Rodriguez quipped, "I'm not a lesbian. Yeah! Mitchie likes sausage."Zac EfronCelebrity blogger Perez Hilton has <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2011-11-29-zac-efron-aiport-lax-sexy-blue-outfit-sunglasses?relate=#.TtkXgHNPkqU" target="_hplink">made no secret of his admiration</a> for the "High School Musical" star, while other gossip sites have openly speculated about Efron's sexuality. Still, Efron <a href="http://www.ivillage.com/zac-efron-addresses-gay-rumors-0/1-a-26706" target="_hplink">has laughed it off</a>: "I know it's very addictive to read that kind of stuff. It's entertainment. Honestly, if the worst [Perez Hilton] can say about me is that I'm gay, then I think I'll be fine. I can handle it."
Alicia Keys The singer-songwriter acknowledges <a href="http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/38024/alicia-keys-i-can-understand-lesbian-rumours" target="_hplink">why many thought she was a lesbian</a> shortly after her Grammy Award-winning debut: "I was definitely rough around the edges. I look back at certain interviews and I'm like, 'Damn! Did I have to look that hard? Did I have to do my hair that way?' More recently, <a href="http://www.theimproper.com/4623/alicia-keys-wants-lesbian-rumors-put-to-rest" target="_hplink">she said</a>, "I'm comfortable in my own skin - comfortable enough to know when something is right for me and when things need to change. All that comes in time, because when I first started out, I hadn't a clue."John Travolta Maybe it's the "Saturday Night Fever" syndrome, but Travolta, who has been married to Kelly Preston since 1991, has been<a href="http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/12/everyone-knows-john-travolta-gay-says-carrie-fisher" target="_hplink"> dogged by gay rumors and reports</a> since the late 1980s. Last year, his attorney Marty Singer sent to a five-page letter to Gawker threatening to sue over posting "false and outrageous" claims in a story <a href="http://gawker.com/5685811/the-secret-sex-life-of-john-travolta" target="_hplink">the site ran in a post called</a> "The Secret Sex Life of John Travolta."Kate HudsonThe "Almost Famous" star, who is currently dating Muse singer Matthew Bellamy and was previously married to Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, said she was baffled by <a href="http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2009/01/09/kate_hudson_baffled_by_lesbian_rumors_" target="_hplink">rumors she'd embarked on a steamy lesbian affair</a>. "No, no, no," she was quoted as saying. "Strictly boys for me!" Ryan Seacrest Speculation about the well-groomed TV's host sexuality has been so rampant, even his girlfriend Julianne Hough <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2010/07/21/julianne-hough-ryan-seacrest-gay-dinner-dating-north-carolina-mortons/" target="_hplink">thought he was gay</a>: "He totally wasn't my type," she said, according to TMZ.com. "I thought he was gay." Several years earlier, Seacrest himself had addressed the rumors, noting, "I know a lot of gay males who I work with that are fantastic people and I love hanging out with them. But because I hang out and bring gay men into my life, does that mean that I'm gay? I promise you that I very much love women."Zoe Saldana Addressing speculation she might be a lesbian, the self-professed tomboy said she <a href="http://www.shewired.com/g-spot/avatars-zoe-saldana-opens-about-her-lesbianism" target="_hplink">wasn't bothered by the reports</a>, adding, "People have sometimes told my grandmother, 'Your granddaughter has a bit of lesbianism in her,'" Saldana said. "It's that my sisters and I spent all our time among men. We were very popular with them. Our way of thinking is very masculine."

Crime News
Elric Shawn Millner, 24, is charged with sexually assaulting a 17-year-old girl in 2010.
A former Marine in Texas befriended his girlfriend's alleged rapist in order to collect video evidence of the assault, cops say.
The alleged victim, whose name has not been released, says that she visited the apartment of Elric Shawn Millner in August 2010, ABC reports. She told police Millner gave her large quantities of alcohol and when she woke up the next morning, she had no recollection of the previous night.
The next morning, however, Millner allegedly showed her videos of himself and another man forcing her to perform sexual acts while she begged them to stop. The victim, who was 17 years old at the time of the incident, can be seen vomiting and urinating on herself while Millner laughs, according to KHOU.
The teenager told no one about the incident for almost two years, KTRK reports, when she detailed the assault to her new boyfriend, who had previously served as a military police officer with the U.S. Marines. Determined to take the case to the police, the boyfriend befriended Millner in an attempt to collect the video evidence, according to the Daily Mail.
After winning Millner's trust, prosecutors say, the ex-Marine convinced Millner to show him the horrifying footage.
Whether or not the boyfriend was able to obtain a copy of the video himself is unclear. Shortly after allegedly viewing it, however, he was able to finally persuade his girlfriend to go to the police about the assault.
Millner was charged on Thursday with aggravated sexual assault and is being held on $50,000 bond. Prosecutors say they now have obtained the video and it will be used as evidence. Contribute to this Story: Send us a tip

WASHINGTON -- While the tax package that Congress passed New Year's Day will protect 99 percent of Americans from an income tax increase, most of them will still end up paying more federal taxes in 2013.
That's because the legislation did nothing to prevent a temporary reduction in the Social Security payroll tax from expiring. In 2012, that 2-percentage-point cut in the payroll tax was worth about $1,000 to a worker making $50,000 a year.
The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington research group, estimates that 77 percent of American households will face higher federal taxes in 2013 under the agreement negotiated between President Barack Obama and Senate Republicans. High-income families will feel the biggest tax increases, but many middle- and low-income families will pay higher taxes too.
Households making between $40,000 and $50,000 will face an average tax increase of $579 in 2013, according to the Tax Policy Center's analysis. Households making between $50,000 and $75,000 will face an average tax increase of $822.
"For most people, it's just the payroll tax," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.
The tax increases could be a lot higher. A huge package of tax cuts first enacted under President George W. Bush was scheduled to expire Tuesday as part of the "fiscal cliff." The Bush-era tax cuts lowered taxes for families at every income level, reduced investment taxes and the estate tax, and enhanced a number of tax credits, including a $1,000-per-child credit.
The package passed Tuesday by the Senate and House extends most the Bush-era tax cuts for individuals making less than $400,000 and married couples making less than $450,000.
Obama said the deal "protects 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small business owners from a middle-class tax hike. While neither Democrats nor Republicans got everything they wanted, this agreement is the right thing to do for our country."
The income threshold covers more than 99 percent of all households, exceeding Obama's claim, according to the Tax Policy Center. However, the increase in payroll taxes will hit nearly every wage earner.
Social Security is financed by a 12.4 percent tax on wages up to $113,700, with employers paying half and workers paying the other half. Obama and Congress reduced the share paid by workers from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent for 2011 and 2012, saving a typical family about $1,000 a year.
Obama pushed hard to enact the payroll tax cut for 2011 and to extend it through 2012. But it was never fully embraced by either party, and this time around, there was general agreement to let it expire.
The new tax package would increase the income tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent on income above $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for married couples. Investment taxes would increase for people who fall in the new top tax bracket.
High-income families will also pay higher taxes this year as part of Obama's 2010 health care law. As part of that law, a new 3.8 percent tax is being imposed on investment income for individuals making more than $200,000 a year and couples making more than $250,000.
Together, the new tax package and Obama's health care law will produce significant tax increases for many high-income families.
For 2013, households making between $500,000 and $1 million would get an average tax increase of $14,812, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis. Households making more than $1 million would get an average tax increase of $170,341.
"If you're rich, you're almost certain to get a big tax increase," Williams said.

Residential Energy-Efficiency CreditsNo tax breaks for being green in 2012. Homeowner investments in energy-efficient double-pane windows or high-efficiency refrigerators, <a href="http://www.energytaxincentives.org/">don't get any tax benefit</a>. More than 43.5 million Americans have filed and received this benefit, with an average reduction in tax liability of $765.84, according to H&R Block.Mortgage Insurance PremiumsBad news for homeowners: They cannot write off mortgage insurance premiums on 2012 tax returns. Congress can act to reauthorize these deductions retroactively to Jan. 1, 2012, and extend them through the end of 2013, but that would cost the government $1.3 billion over the next decade, the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/07/business/la-fi-harney-20121007">Los Angeles Times reports</a>.Adoption CreditTaxpayers who have out-of-pocket adoption expenses or who adopted a child with special needs can only claim the adoption credit to the extent of their tax liability. While the portion of the credit not taken into account in 2012, up to $12,650 per child, is carried forward to future years, the benefit is no longer fully refundable, according to tax experts.Alternative Minimum TaxIf the alternative minimum tax legislation is not retroactively patched for 2012, current law could result in an increased tax liability for up to 34 million Americans. According to a study by the Tax Institute at H&R Block, an average family making $85,000 with children in college could see their tax liability soar from a $1,056 refund to owing $1,400.American Opportunity Tax CreditTuition bills will be higher starting on Jan. 1 because families will lose the $2,500 American Opportunity Tax Credit, which ends in 2012 unless Congress takes action. More than 2.4 million Americans claimed this deduction in 2009, resulting in a combined decrease in taxable income of $5.4 billion, according to tax experts. Payroll Tax CreditPaychecks will be smaller starting Jan. 1, 2013. An American making $50,000, for example, will lose $80 in monthly pay after the credit ends. The temporary credit also has lowered the amount workers contributed to Social Security by 2 percent. Educator Expense DeductionTeachers lose their $250 maximum deduction on expenses related to buying school supplies. This credit expired at the end of 2011, and teachers won't be able to claim this benefit on their 2012 taxes unless Congress takes action. In 2009, more than 3.8 million teachers claimed this benefit for a combined deduction of $9.7 billion, according to H&R Block.Sales Tax As An Itemized DeductionTaxpayers will no longer have the option of claiming an itemized deduction for state sales tax in lieu of state income tax. This expiration will have a greater impact on taxpayers who reside in a state with sales tax, but no income tax, including Alaska, Florida, Texas, Nevada, Washington, South Dakota, and Wyoming.IRA Retirement FundsTaxpayers over age 70½ no longer have the option of directing their income from an IRA distribution to a charitable organization. Starting this year, older taxpayers must include the distribution in income and claim a charitable deduction, resulting in a potentially higher tax bracket and a need to itemize instead of claiming the standard deduction, according to H&R Block.Later refundsAs if losing all those tax credits was not bad enough, the earliest date to file a 2012 tax return electronically has moved back to Jan. 22, 2013. As the IRS has indicated that refunds could take as long as 21 days to process this year, a refund in January to cover Christmas credit card payments, winter heating bills, or rent is unlikely.

'American Idol': Seretha Guinn Auditions To Bring Good News To Her Recovering Boyfriend
As usual, "American Idol" wrapped the Charlotte auditions with a touching story and a beautiful voice. This time, the voice belonged to 26-year-old Seretha Guinn. She brought her beautiful 3-year-old daughter in with her to the audition. The tot was a huge fan of Nicki Minaj, though too shy to do much more than nod her agreement.
Guinn was there in secret, hoping to bring home some good news to her boyfriend, who almost died in a terrible accident. Since then, he's gone through eight surgeries and was still recovering at home. She wanted to cheer him up with the surprise of her moving on to Hollywood. To get there, she tapped into the world of sitcom theme songs.
Seretha's take on "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" theme song left the judges shocked and impressed. She followed it up with LeAnn Rimes' "How Do I Live," But Mariah Carey said she'd preferred Seretha's stab at the "Fresh Prince." Either way, it was unanimous support for the mother and her daughter, as she went off to share the good news -- and a golden ticket to Hollywood -- with her boyfriend.
The audition rounds of "American Idol" keep moving across the country, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on Fox.
TV Replay scours the vast television landscape to find the most interesting, amusing, and, on a good day, amazing moments, and delivers them right to your browser.

You'll Be Able To Use Electronics Any Time On Planes Soon: NYTimes

Technology News
The tragic 15 to 20 minutes of time during flights when no digital devices are allowed may soon be a thing of the past, The New York Times reports.
The Federal Aviation Administration is planning to change its rules on the use of electronic devices on airplanes, according to The Times. Changes may go into effect as soon as next year.
The new rules will allow plane passengers to use devices to read, listen to music and watch videos while the plane is taking off and landing, the paper's Jad Mouawad and Nick Bilton report. Bilton has been doggedly covering the FAA's archaic rules regarding electronics.
"We think the FAA has been too cautious in rethinking common-sense modifications to the policy, so this is a long time coming," professor Joseph P. Schwieterman of DePaul University told The Huffington Post in a phone interview Monday. Schwieterman is a co-author of a study on the FAA's ban on technology use on planes. The study revealed that those who fly were unable to use their electronics for more than 100 million hours in 2013 because of the current rules.
"Consumers are increasingly demanding answers as to why the policy never seems to change, why it never gets modified in response to the changing times," Schwieterman told HuffPost. "I think that's what they're doing now."
While travelers will be able to use their devices for some functions, they still won't be allowed to make or receive calls, text or use Wi-Fi, anonymous members of the FAA advisory panel told The Times. As the rules currently stand, all electronic devices must be turned off while the plane is taking off or landing.
Despite what you may have thought, the reason electronic devices are not allowed during takeoff and landing isn't because they could interfere with the pilot's controls. They aren't powerful enough to do that, The Times reports. In reality, the FAA requires airlines to conduct tests to prove that any device allowed for use is safe -- but since there are so many different phones, tablets and laptops coming out every year, it's been easier just to ban them altogether.

Guns (821 Of Them!)Let's start with guns, because there're just so damn many of them. The TSA reports that it's confiscated 821 firearms in 2012 to date (691 of which were loaded). Some were stowed away in creative places, like in <a href="http://blog.tsa.gov/2012/06/tsa-week-in-review-portland-passenger.html" target="_hplink">a potted plant</a> or <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/09/gun-parts-found-hidden-in-stuffed-animals_n_1502545.html?utm_hp_ref=tsa" target="_hplink">inside stuffed animals</a>. Poor Mickey Mouse!Batman Throwing StarsEveryone knows that the Batman has his own plane and doesn't need to fly commercial. This faker, <a href="http://blog.tsa.gov/2012/06/tsa-week-in-review-bazooka-round.html" target="_hplink">caught in San Diego in June</a>, is not Bruce Wayne.Breast PumpsThe crazy thing about this story wasn't what was stopped from going on a plane, but why. A mother of a 9-month-old was told she <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/02/amy-strand-breast-milk_n_1317058.html?utm_hp_ref=tsa" target="_hplink">couldn't board her plane</a> in Hawaii in February with her breast pump.

Alexandra Wyman via Getty Images	Alex Calderwood, the co-founder of the hip Ace Hotel chain, has died. He was 47.
SEATTLE (AP) — Alex Calderwood, the Seattle co-founder of the hip Ace Hotel chain, has died in London at age 47.
His company, Atelier Ace, said on its website that he passed away Thursday but released no information about the cause. The statement calls Calderwood "our teacher, mentor, guru and most importantly our dear friend."
In 1999, he and two friends launched Seattle's Ace Hotel in a flophouse that formerly served maritime workers. It's renowned for its much-imitated style, with vintage and repurposed furniture, record players and guestroom art by Shepard Fairey — who later became famous for creating the "HOPE" poster that came to symbolize Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
Ace Hotels later opened in Portland, Ore.; New York; Palm Springs, Calif.; and London, with others scheduled to open late this year or early next year in Panama City, Panama, and Los Angeles. Ace describes itself on its website as "a collection of individuals — multiple and inclusive, held together by an affinity for the soulful."
"We try to do unexpected things from a design standpoint," Calderwood told The New York Times in 2008. "We want to celebrate the everyday with utilitarian objects."
Calderwood grew up in Seattle's eastside suburbs. Just out of high school, he began managing a Seattle clothing store called International News. He used material from a Boeing Co. surplus store to create fixtures, desks and other parts of a showroom, Amit Shah, who hired him, told The Seattle Times (http://is.gd/iDAxkp ).
"He saw what you could do with material that nobody else wanted," Shah said. "He always had a desire to come up with something new that gave consumers value for their money. He was an entrepreneur and knew how to entertain, but more than that, he was always willing to talk about what the new thing was."
In 1993, Calderwood and two partners started a Seattle chain of rock-themed barbershops called Rudy's. The stores were a hit, and there are now eight of them in Seattle and nine others spread through in Portland, New York and Los Angeles.
He went on to open a popular Seattle nightclub before becoming a hotelier.
Ryan Bukstein, Ace's director of public relations and marketing, said he had been working for the company for 14 years, since starting as an intern while in college. Calderwood was his friend and mentor, he said.
"His humility, spirit of collaboration and tireless work ethic has influenced our family at Atelier Ace and creatives across the globe," Bukstein wrote in an email Sunday. "We all plan to continue moving forward with the ideals Alex championed so naturally."
Calderwood is survived by his parents, Thomas and Kathleen Calderwood of Seattle; two sisters, Donna Roberts and Tahnee Ferry; and a brother, Tim Calderwood.

Often on a road trip we map out certain must-see places to stop and we overlook other destinations due to the time allotted for the trip. In South Dakota the big tourist stop in our blog post on this state is Mount Rushmore. But remember to add Deadwood to the list of places to stop if you want to channel the real Wild West experience.
In 1874 gold was discovered in the Black Hills of South Dakota, sparking the last big gold rush in America. Two years later, the town of Deadwood was born. Deadwood Gulch was named after the dead trees in the gulch where it is located and where there was a creek full of gold. Here, you can explore the Old Wild West and see that it wasn't just a popular TV show.
You can go to Deadwood to channel the past and even stay at one of the old historic hotels on Main Street, such as the Bullock Hotel, the town's first hotel built by Deadwood's first sheriff, Seth Bullock. In fact, the entire town is on the National Historic Register.
"The Bullock Hotel was built in 1890s," says Lee Harstad, Deadwood's marketing director. "That's pretty authentic. A lot of people have said they've seen Seth Bullock's ghost there."
It is believed he still oversees the property, thus drawing ghost tours to this hotel, as well as the popular Travel Channel show "Ghost Hunters."
Explore old Main Street. Unlike many of our city streets today, shops here are unique. And most of the corners in Deadwood have informational plaques. "We also have a series of QR codes so you can see what it looked like back then," Harstad said. "Many times it's very similar."
Deadwood is still a real thriving town. "It's an actual city, population 1,400. We're definitely a visitor destination, but there are a lot of year round residents including myself and we take great pride in this community," Harstad said.
Deadwood legalized gambling in 1989 and if you miss the sound of coins in a slot machine, you can still find coin slots here. "In late 1980s there was a large fire at one of the blocks in town and some history went up in smoke. The town leaders wanted to save the community and a group of citizens went to the state to push for limited state gambling so the proceeds could go towards preserving the history of the town."
Besides taking in the Wild West aura that Deadwood offers, a big draw are the famous who once lived here such as Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane and Seth Bullock. Tourists often like to visit their final resting place in Mount Moriah Cemetery.
When the HBO show "Deadwood" came out, it made this real old American West town a stop on many road trip itineraries.
"When that show came out, it had an impact because people saw the show and the grittiness because that's what Deadwood used to be," Harstad said. "People saw that and didn't realize there could be a town like that. So that opened people's eyes. Whether it's for the gaming or the history, we offer that for them."
While in Deadwood, another fun stop is the Broken Boot Gold Mine, which offers tours every 30 minutes. You get to follow the path of old ore carts underground in the old shafts.
"It's a tour of an old underground mine and they explain how they did it and how the miners had to dig through the rock," Harstad said.
Another interesting part of Deadwood's history is that there was a Chinatown. Although there isn't anything to see there now, some of the Chinese are buried at Mount Moriah Cemetary. Like many old Wild West towns, they came for a better life and many established laundry businesses in Deadwood.
"Chinatown is located on lower Main Street," Harstad points out. "Archaeologists are out here annually and often find Chinese artifacts. Adams Museum offers Chinese artifacts from the Chinatown." Some of those include mining and laundry items, which Harstad says will also be exhibited at the new Days of '76 Museum.

A few weeks ago, I flipped on the TV and the disturbing video of UC Davis students peacefully protesting while getting pepper sprayed by police aired on the news. Jake, not a stranger to the violent history of the world (he likes to fight the Nazi's for pretend), came running in when I shouted. I couldn't contain my response. Oh my God.
Is it my job as a mother to shield an almost eight-year-old from a lesson about society and social unrest? Or do I discuss current events with him as I see fit? Sure, I could have turned off the TV. Sure, I could have said. "Oh, nothing I thought I saw a mouse." But I have been teaching him about the economic unrest of this country in the past few months since I was first moved by the demonstrations of Occupy Wall Street. This was a silent, non violent, peaceful protest -- and yet. And yet students at UC Davis were sprayed with pepper spray by police because they weren't... moving. This was a lesson I wanted my son to grasp. I explained that we have the right to protest. That there are a lot of people who can't find jobs. That people are angry. And they're showing their display of anger and protesting. Our right to protest is core to our constitution. The other day, Brian Lehrer of WNYC talked about the incident with Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows who discussed what it meant to hold restraint in protest and how images like the one at UC Davis has come to haunt the nation just as other images have through history. Lehrer said:
"Perhaps the most remarkable part of the incident as captured on video was not the cold, calculated pepper spraying itself, but the restraint of the protesters for minutes after."
His response gave me more thought. Yes, I had made the right choice in showing him the image. It was a crucial lesson in raising a boy. Violence doesn't have to make a point. Non-violence, as long it is something you believe in, can be equally, or more convincing. The parents of those students should be proud of their children's restraint.
But not everyone is thrilled about parents like me teaching our kids about politics at such a young age. Just recently I read the outrage that HuffPo users had over the parent who announced that they'd bring their kids to Occupy Wall Street. Over 1,000 people so outraged that they'd shower their anger onto one parent. So I wonder. Was Jake too young to see that pepper spraying incident? For me, I'd rather expose him to current events if the moment is right. I'd rather expose him now than hide it all and pretend that there isn't unrest. That a movement isn't happening. Because there is a powerful movement happening. And here's your first introduction to it my lovely boy.
And now, you can go back to being a kid.

Verizon 3Q profit soars as number of devices grows
October 17, 2013 08:34 AM EST |

versions NEW YORK — NEW YORK (AP) — Verizon's third-quarter net income jumped 40 percent as it continued to add more wireless devices to its network.
The country's largest cellphone carrier earned $2.23 billion, or 78 cents per share, up from $1.59 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2012. Excluding one-time items, the company posted an adjusted profit of 77 cents per share for the recent quarter.
Revenue rose 4 percent to $30.28 billion from $29.01 billion.
The results Thursday beat Wall Street predictions. Analysts polled by FactSet expected a profit of 74 cents per share on $30.15 billion in revenue.
The New York company added 1.1 million net retail wireless connections during the quarter. Of that total, 927,000 were connections that involved monthly service contracts.
As of Sept. 30, the company had 101.2 million retail wireless connections, representing a 6 percent increase over the same day a year ago.
Revenue at the wireless division rose 7 percent to $20.4 billion. That growth included an 8 percent increase in service revenue to $17.5 billion.
Verizon announced last month that it would spend $130 billion to buy the 45 percent stake in its wireless division that was owned by Vodafone Group PLC. Once that deal closes, it will no longer have to share its wireless revenue with the British cellphone company.
Shares of Verizon Communications Inc. rose 2 percent to $48.40 in premarket trading.

10 Things You Feel When You're Single During the Holidays

I'm single and most of the time, I'm really OK with that. Except, of course, when Valentine's Day marks a giant "X" on my calendar and I'm left feeling inadequate because I have to buy myself a life-size bear made out of milk chocolate to feel better. Or when I attend one of my darling friend's wedding and find myself sitting at the "singles" table while everyone else is off slow dancing to some Boyz II Men track.
Anyway, SSS, or Single Sadness Syndrome (this has not been endorsed by Dr. Oz -- yet), rises to the surface like a persistent pimple during the holidays. And while all the couples are off doing couples things like holding hands while ice skating through Central Park, feeding each other pieces of pie or taking selfies smooching underneath mistletoe, us single folk are left feeling like this:
1. Alone - at places like your company holiday party, your family's Christmas dinner or watching Home Alone 2 while the snow barricades you into a weekend of seclusion. Everyone else is sipping bubbly and exchanging saliva with their counterparts, and you're flirting with the delivery guy from Seamless, who knows the intimate details of your sushi order.
2. Cold - it's extra cold when you're lonely. That's a fact. I'd take the body heat of someone else's arms wrapping themselves around the goose bumps of mine over a raggedy blanket that I've washed a million times and have had since I was wearing diapers.
3. Suffocated - by the nagging questions of family members over why you're still single. They ask you how many dates you went on this year and why they didn't work out and what other avenues you're exploring to meet new people, as if they are hired consultants trying to strengthen your business.
4. Confused - as to why all your friends are getting engaged during the holiday season as if there was some kind of BOGO ring special at Jared. Some of these people you didn't even know had a boyfriend! Others, you know well. Very well.
5. Desperate - is the thought bouncing around your head like a 4-year-old needing to pee: Who you are going to smooch when the ball drops on New Year's Eve?All the couples are getting cozy and the only single guy at the party is stuffing his mouth with chips and salsa. There's no room in there for you in there.
6. Nostalgic - is how you'll feel if you go home for the holidays and run into people you haven't seen since you were covered in pimples and your teeth were attached to metal braces. And these people, who you've successfully hidden from your Facebook newsfeed, will talk about how much they miss the days when you'd have sleepovers with them before they'll start telling you about their high-paying job that lets them travel to places like Thailand and Paris and their boyfriend who is a Calvin Klein underwear model.
7. Extra alone - especially at your Great Aunt's holiday party, where you wish you had a sidekick so that when all your relatives are engaged in some heated talk over family politics, you can maintain eye contact with someone who will make you sane.
8. Really alone - because sure, being single on Valentine's Day is a drag. But at least you can just hibernate for 24 hours and trick your brain into believing you're happy by eating an insane amount of chocolate. At least it's just one day.
9. Bothered - because everything (the infestation of tourists, the suffocating decorations, the holiday jingles that play on repeat) is more tolerable when you're in love. When you have someone special by your side.
10. Selfish - because it's always nice to roll around in beautifully-wrapped presents and line our refrigerators with greeting cards from friends. But there's just something about the gift of telling someone, for the first time or in a different way, how much you love them. How much they really mean to you.

It's 9 a.m. and L.A.-based playwright Sigrid Gilmer sits at her PC with a cup of coffee and dry erase board, poised and ready to write. At the top of the board, she writes, "Menu." Imagining the incoming customers to her shop, she writes a list of possible offerings that will be available to them when they arrive. The delicious appetizers and entrees are potential storylines for the characters to consider. Her "shop" remains open until 5 p.m., and then she closes until the next day. Rising to the status of successful playwright is no easy feat, but Sigrid makes it look like a cakewalk. The walk starts every day slowly and deliberately by sitting at a desk and viewing writing as a job. With Israeli writer Amos Oz as an inspiration, Sigrid embraced the menu-writing approach to developing scripts. Situating herself as a skilled shopkeeper, she feeds her characters rich experiences and diverse possibilities.
Today, Sigrid's skill for crafting interesting narratives is being affirmed with her simultaneous debut of two pieces -- including a feature in the Black Women: State of the Union (BWSOTU) production. This success has not come without time and perseverance. Sigrid started writing stories as a child. By 1995, she began pursuing her dream in earnest when she moved to New York and joined the HERE Arts Center working in the box office. Pursuing her dream in New York quietly at first, she worked up the courage to write and produce her first production in 1998. She continued to work on her craft, yet several years later her first professional production was a tepid success, according to her own estimation. She recalls this time with sadness, even today when she remembers reading the first review. She read it and cried during an entire flight from New York City to Los Angeles where she lived at the time.
Fast forward to the current season, Sigrid now has two productions being produced in Hollywood, California -- an unusual occurrence in today's theater world. Sigrid's Seed: A Weird Act of Faith is going to be performed starting October 25 at the Chuco's Justice Center (Operated by the Youth Justice Coalition) as part of the Cornerstone Theatre Company's Hunger Cycle, a series of nine world premier plays exploring hunger, justice, and food equity issues. The talented playwright's short play, Black Simulacra which is a part of the Black Women: State of the Union production runs at the Skylight Theater, starting October 27. In describing Black Simulacra, Sigrid states:
A simulacra is a false representation of something real. Like a Paris Hotel in Las Vegas is a simulacra of Paris, right? It is supposed to be a really good fake of the real thing. It is like the images we see of black women. Even if the representations are trying to be quote, unquote authentic. The problem is that "authentic" images of black women are relegated to a few standards that have been playing out in the American cultural psyche for centuries -- the hardened, quick to anger, eye- and neck-rolling Sapphire, sassy beloved maids, mammie and black bestie, the hyper-sexual man-eater bopping to a modern beat as the video ho, the long suffering mamas. None of these images are real, nor do they express the depth and breadth of the experiences of black women now.
Black Simulacra is the second piece written by Sigrid to appear in the tri-annual BWSOTU production which consists of diverse vignettes of black women's experiences in the U.S. In 2009, Sigrid's piece Black Girl Rising explored a black girl who develops super powers, faces the limits of her powers and embarks on a journey to discover her own identity and become free of other people's ideals. Like Black Girl Rising, in her efforts to cook up unique experiences for her characters, the playwright herself breaks the mold and conjures new understandings of the meaning of black womanhood.
For more information about Black Women: State of the Union, visit http://www.bwsotu.org. Details about the Cornerstone Theater Company's production at Seed may be found at http://cornerstonetheater.org/SEED.

The weather outside is it frightful? The better part of the Northeast is bracing for a blizzard. Snow is already blanketing the nation's capital. Dire warnings are being issued and according to The Weather Channel: "This new massive Atlantic storm will continue to strengthen today and bring dangerous heavy snow and even white-out conditions from the Virginias to Washington, DC to Philadelphia to New York City to Southern New England."
Yes, we know those of us living in warmer clime's don't think much about the frosty white stuff (we're not talking the South Beach kind of white stuff), and are saying what's all the fuss? And, we admit it is lousy to skid down the street in Virginia; to get a hernia shoveling in Philadelphia; or, to be stuck forever at La Guardia (we shudder at the thought).
But, whatever happened to snow being fun? Whatever happened to playing? Maybe if Tiger hadn't spent his whole childhood working at a game, as opposed to playing games, maybe we wouldn't be watching this lurid drama unfold. It reminds us that we're all so worried about getting somewhere, that we lose sight of where we are. Sometimes it's pretty good to be stuck inside with a good book, a fire, a game or two. No striving, no shopping, no spending (music to the ears of any bitch on a budget). Get out and play. Shovel out just enough to make the path you need to enjoy yourself. Gather together your friends and frenemies. Make forts and have a snowball fight (that's why we said to invite your frenemies). Take a deep breath (not up the nose, please) climb the local hill, jump on your sled or saucer, race down. It's great exercise. It's wicked fun. And, it's free.
