VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) — Larger vessels sailing along the Atlantic Seaboard are being reminded to slow down for right whales.
The Coast Guard has implemented "Operation Right Speed" through April 2012 to ensure the migratory mammals have a safe passage along the Atlantic seaboard.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has implemented regulations that require vessels 65 feet or greater to operate at 10 knots or less in areas where the right whales are known to migrate.
The first female right whale of the season was seen this month off Georgia.
Right whales are among the most threatened of all the whales worldwide. The global population is estimated in the hundreds.

Style News
Julia Louis-Dreyfus stars as the vice-president in the new HBO series "Veep," and to get her character's wardrobe just right, she took her style cues from one of D.C.'s biggest style icons -- Michelle Obama.
The actress, recently told People magazine that FLOTUS' fashion choices helped get into the right sartorial mindset to play her character, Selina Meyer.
Louis-Dreyfus confesses, though, that her character is not totally as chic as our beloved First Lady Michelle Obama. The actress also says she's a huge fan of FLOTUS' looks IRL; she gushes that Michelle is “my icon, I adore her. Oh, my god, look how she puts the belt around the sweater! I don’t feel as though I’m as cool as she is.” A girl after our own hearts!
Louis-Dreyfus sports a professional look on the show, wearing slim-fitting suits and colorful blouses. Though she steers away from Michelle Obama's style of florals and prints her character is not afraid to accessorize, donning everything from a classic string of pearls to a huge brooch. While the first lady tends toward a refined and stylish look, Louis-Dreyfus adopts a slightly sexier look with lower necklines.
Though we're big fans of the power suit, we'd like to see Julia Louis-Dreyfus change it up with some rotating colors besides the stereotypical black and various shades of red and burgundy. We suggest a form-fitting jacket with a straight edge, instead of a typical blazer cut. Also, how about changing up the top-bottom combos? Jackets don't need to match skirts so that your figure turns into a blob of singular color.
We look forward to seeing what else Selina Meyer has in her closet this season.

An upcoming exhibit at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles is bringing together the controversial oeuvre of photography provocateur, Robert Mapplethorpe. The American artist, remembered for his highly stylized portrayals of nude men and sexually charged flowers, will be celebrated in a new show titled, "In Focus: Robert Mapplethorpe."
Robert Mapplethorpe (American, 1946 - 1989) Patti Smith, negative 1975, Gelatin silver print. The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, Jointly acquired by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, with funds provided by The David Geffen Foundation, and The J. Paul Getty Trust. © Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation. The exhibit showcases 23 images captured by the artist during the 1970s and 1980s, including a number of last edition prints, rarely seen mixed-media projects, and Mapplethorpe's signature Polaroids. The collection sweeps the spectrum of self-portraits, nudes and still lifes beginning with Mapplethorpe's early collaged work, demonstrating the artist's tendency to deconstruct the sexual, fetishistic images of magazines apparent in works like "Leatherman #1" and "Banana & Keys." The latter piece, a 1973 shadow box construction, reflects both the homoerotic iconography Mapplethorpe gravitated toward as well as the influence of his idol and predecessor, Andy Warhol.
The mid-1970s marked the period in which Mapplethorpe turned almost exclusively to photography, shooting black and white portraits of close friends, models and himself. The Getty exhibit features a number of key works from this era, including Mapplethorpe's now-famous photograph of Patti Smith. The longtime friend and sometimes lover of the artist is shown in men's attire, outfitted in the androgynous stylings for which Mapplethorpe was famous. These intimate portraits are contrasted with the classically staged images he created a decade later in the 1980s. Reminiscent of the poses of ancient Greek art, Mapplethorpe's nude bodies of varying skin tones are seen arranged in pieces like "Ken and Lydia and Tyler" that provide striking visual representations that defy gender or racial categorization.

Paul Getty Trust and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
In total, the Getty exhibit, which will be shown concurrently with an exhibit of Mapplethorpe's famed X, Y and Z portfolios at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is a comprehensive review of the art star's career, presenting the breadth of content hidden behind his monochromatic works of contemporary fine art. "The mixed-media objects and Polaroid snapshots in the exhibition demonstrate the struggle of a budding artist to find his proper medium of expression and develop his aesthetic vision,” wrote Paul Martineau, associate curator of photographs at the Getty Museum, in a press release for the exhibit. “However, the carefully crafted gelatin silver and platinum prints make evident Mapplethorpe’s mature style as well as his eye for prints of the highest quality and beauty.”
"In Focus: Robert Mapplethorpe" will be on view from October 23, 2012–March 24, 2013 at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The exhibition is drawn from work jointly acquired with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), and will run concurrently with LACMA’s exhibition "Robert Mapplethorpe: XYZ." Scroll down for more images from "In Focus: Robert Mapplethorpe." Let us know what you think of the exhibit in the comments section.

Full Court Pres shoveled the ball to Dunk'em, who missed the easy layup.
"Shi-cago!" shouted Pres. "I thought you said this school stuff was easy."
"It got me here, didn't it?" said Dunk'em with a smile. "It's all about ball control. The media eat it up."
"But what about the score? The real deal? Don't you have to make points?"
"Sure," replied Dunk, walking to a complex control panel on the sidelines. He pushed a button and the basket lowered to the height of an eight year old. Eyes closed, Dunk'em tossed the ball toward the net. Swish!
"Plenty of ways to score," he explained. "Lower the basket or make it wider. The ball can be smaller or lighter. Whatever combination helps! We keep drilling until the players can barely pass, then take a picture before they forget. Sometimes we just reset the scoreboard. No one seems to care as long as they look good. We're putting these control panels into every district in the country."
Full Court looked worried. "But hold on. We're playing the Republicans. Aren't they going to know?"
"You don't get it. We're playing with them, not against them. We're crushing the players' union, throwing out rules, creating hedge fund owner/managers. If any player fails, they just take the player off the roster so their record doesn't go down. Mostly, though, the low performers just leave anyway. They and the handicapped and the non-English speakers. But there's so much razzle dazzle, the public doesn't notice. Republicans had Shock and Awe. We've got Race to the Top!"
"But won't we be exposed, Dunk'em? You have all that technology but they still can't read the play book or count up to a double dribble."
"No problem, Pres. That happened in my last job. By the time people realized that scores hadn't really gone up and my new teams were as bad as the old ones, I was gone. That's what all the greats do. Paige in Houston. Vallas in Chicago, then Philly. By the time you and I are found out we'll be into your second term or writing our memoirs."
"What's your title?" asked Pres.
"I wanted to call it, Waiting for 'Superman'.
"Still a good idea. I hear fiction sells."

Why is it that we believe we can feed our bodies industrial, nutrient-depleted food-like substances empty of life and be healthy? How did we come to believe that food industry chemicals and processing could replace nature-made foods?
A hundred years ago all food was organic, local, seasonal, fresh or naturally-preserved by ancient methods. All food was food. Now less than 3 percent of our agricultural land is used to grow fruits and vegetables, which should make up 80 percent of our diet. Today there are not even enough fruits and vegetables in this country to allow all Americans to follow the government guidelines to eat five to nine servings a day.
What most of us are left with is industrial food. And who knows what lurks in the average boxed, packaged, or canned factory-made science project.
When a French fry has more than 20 ingredients and almost all of them are not potato, or when a fast food hamburger contains very little meat, or when the average teenager consumes 34 teaspoons of sugar a day, we are living in a food nightmare, a sci-fi horror show.
The very fact that we are having a national conversation about what we should eat, that we are struggling with the question about what the best diet is, is symptomatic of how far we have strayed from the natural conditions that gave rise to our species, from the simple act of eating real, whole, fresh food. When it becomes a revolutionary act to eat real food, we are in trouble.
The food industry, which is the second biggest employer in America after the federal government, heavily influences the media and government agencies that regulate it (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration and Congress) and intentionally confuses and confounds us.
Low-fat is good -- so anything with a "low-fat" on the label must be healthy. But Coke is 100 percent fat-free and that doesn't make it a health food. Now we are told to eat more whole grains, so a few flecks of whole grains are sprinkled on sugary cereals. That doesn't make them a health food either.
The best advice is to avoid foods with health claims on the label, or better yet avoid foods with labels in the first place.
In the 21st century our tastes buds, our brain chemistry, our biochemistry, our hormones and our kitchens have been hijacked by the food industry. The food-like substances proffered by the industrial food system food trick our taste buds into momentary pleasure, but not our biology, which reacts, rejects and reviles the junk plied on our genes and our hormonal and biochemical pathways. We need to unjunk our biology.
Industrial processing has given rise to an array of addictive, fattening, metabolism-jamming chemicals and compounds including aspartame, MSG (monosodium glutamate), high-fructose corn syrup and trans fats, to name the biggest offenders.
MSG is used to create fat mice so researchers can study obesity. MSG is an excito-toxin that stimulates your brain to eat uncontrollably. When fed to mice, they pig out and get fat. It is in 80 percent of processed foods and mostly disguised as "natural flavorings."
And trans fat, for example, is derived from a real food -- vegetable oil -- chemically altered to resist degradation by bacteria, which is why modern cookies last on the shelf for years.
But the ancient energy system of your cells is descended from bacteria and those energy factories, or mitochondria, cannot process these trans fats either. Your metabolism is blocked and weight gain and Type 2 diabetes ensue.
Your tongue can be fooled and your brain can become addicted to the slick combinations of fat, sugar, and salt pumped into factory-made foods, but your biochemistry cannot, and the result is the disaster of obesity and chronic disease we have in America today.
No wonder 68 percent of Americans are overweight. No wonder that from 1960 to today obesity rates have risen from 13 percent to 36 percent and soon will reach 42 percent. Over the last decade the rate of pre-diabetes or diabetes in teenagers has risen from 9 percent to 23 percent.
Really? Almost one in four of our kids now has pre-diabetes or Type 2 diabetes? And 37 percent of normal weight kids have one or more cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or high blood sugar, because even though factory food doesn't make them fat, it makes them sick!
It is time to take our kitchens and our homes back. Transforming the food industry seems monumental, a gigantic undertaking. But it is not. It is a small problem. In the small places in our lives, our shopping carts, the fridge, the cupboard, the kitchen and on our dining room table is where all the power is.
It is the hundreds of little choices, the small actions you make every day, that will topple the monolithic food industry. This century is littered with the bodies and institutions of fallen despots and despotic regimes -- from the fall of the Berlin wall to the Arab spring. There is no force more powerful than a small group of individuals with a desire to end injustice and abuse.
A very simple idea can break through the confusion and plant the seeds of a revolution. Our bodies were designed to run on real food. Our natural default state is health. We need to simplify our way of eating.
Unjunk our diet, detoxify our bodies and our minds and we heal. Simply choose foods such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, healthy oils (olive oil, fish oil, avocado and coconut oil), small amounts of whole grains and beans and lean animal protein including small wild fish, grass fed meat, and farm eggs.
There are no diets, no calorie counting, and no measuring fats, carbs or protein grams. None of that matters if you choose real, whole, fresh, live foods. If you choose quality, the rest takes care of itself.
When you eat empty industrial food with addictive chemicals and sugar, your body craves more, looking for nutrients in a dead food where none are to be found. Yet after eating nutrient dense fresh food for a few days the biological addiction to industrial food is broken, and in a few more days your cells begin to rejuvenate and you heal from the inside out.
And the side effects are all good ones: effortless weight loss, reversal of high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, clearing of brain fog, lifting of depression and fatigue and even better skin, hair and nails.
What is more important than what you take out of your diet is what you put in. Add in the good stuff and there won't be room for the bad. Mother Nature is the best pharmacist and food is the most powerful drug on the planet. It works faster, better and cheaper than any other pharmaceutical.
Whole, real food spiced up with a few super foods such as chia, hemp, parsley, cilantro, coconut and green juicing can beneficially affect thousands of genes, regulate dozens of hormones, and enhance the function of tens of thousands of protein networks.
Dinner is a date with the doctor. What you put at the end of your fork is more powerful than anything you will ever find at the bottom of a prescription bottle. The roadmap to health is simple: eat real food, practice self-love rather than self-loathing, imagine yourself well, get sufficient sleep, and incorporate movement into your life. The solution to our health crisis and obesity epidemic is not complicated.
Health and happiness are often just a few days away. Each of us has the capacity to make the small changes in our lives that will create big changes in our food landscape, our agriculture and even our government policies.
I hope you will use the power of your fork to be part of the start of a true food revolution.
Now I'd like to hear from you...
Have you changed your eating habits to include more real food?

Losing weight may have been hard thus far, but it doesn't have to be. Let's look at three of the reasons your diet has probably not been working, and then I'll show you how to change things up. Susan Blumenthal, M.D.: The Weight of the Nation
We now must act boldly to combat the obesity epidemic. There are many opportunities across the lifespan, but it will require a shift in social norms and an unprecedented social movement for obesity prevention.	Carrie Wiatt, M.S.: Coconut Oil: A Tropical Disease-Fighting Super-Oil?
Although I love all things coconut, from coconut water to coconut scents, I don't give special treatment to the newest craze: coconut oil. It most likely isn't the cure-all that many experts now claim.	Ellie Knaus: The Best Cancer-Fighting Salad Ever! (VIDEO)
After a recent health scare, I'm taking better care of myself. And since 80 percent of the immune system is in our gut, I'm adopting a clean diet. But there's one little problem. I don't know how to cook.	Michele Simon: Guide to Fighting Fast Food in Your Own Backyard
There has never been a better time to get active and take a stand against the infiltration of fast food in your neighborhood. We certainly cannot wait for policymakers in Washington to protect the people.	Heather Bauer, RD, CDN: What Food Labels Really Mean
For most, deciphering nutrition labels can be like reading hieroglyphics. It can be time-consuming and thankless. I'm committed to providing my readers as much accurate nutrition information as possible.	William Anderson, MA, LMHC: Weight Loss and the Solution to the Obesity Epidemic
To solve the obesity epidemic, the most important thing you can do is to solve your own weight problem for your own reasons.	Most Popular

While Jefferson may not be the best personal model of religious liberty, or liberty simpliciter, we can be grateful to live in a society where his grand idea was planted (though it is taking centuries to blossom). It is now our task to turn Jefferson's promise into reality: to see American Muslims as full US citizens with the right to free conscience and freedom from persecution.
