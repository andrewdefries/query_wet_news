The Secret Service will assign chaperones on some trips to enforce new rules of conduct.
WASHINGTON -- Embarrassed by a prostitution scandal, the Secret Service will assign chaperones on some trips to enforce new rules of conduct that make clear that excessive drinking, entertaining foreigners in their hotel rooms and cavorting in disreputable establishments are no longer tolerated.
The stricter measures, issued by the Secret Service on Friday for agents and employees, apply even when traveling personnel are off duty.
The policies, outlined in a memorandum obtained by The Associated Press, are the agency's latest attempt to respond to the scandal that surfaced as President Barack Obama was headed to a Latin American summit in Cartagena, Colombia, earlier this month.
The embattled Secret Service director, Mark Sullivan, urged agents and other employees to "consider your conduct through the lens of the past several weeks."
Sullivan said the rules "cannot address every situation that our employees will face as we execute our dual-missions throughout the world." He added: "The absence of a specific, published standard of conduct covering an act or behavior does not mean that the act is condoned, is permissible or will not call for – and result in – corrective or disciplinary action."
"All employees have a continuing obligation to confront expected abuses or perceived misconduct," Sullivan said.
Ethics classes will be conducted for agency employees next week.
The changes were intended to staunch the embarrassing disclosures since April 13, when a prostitution scandal erupted in Cartagena involving 12 Secret Service agents, officers and supervisors and 12 more enlisted military personnel who were there ahead of Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas.
But the new policies raised questions about claims that the behavior discovered in Cartagena was an isolated incident: Why would the Secret Service formally issue new regulations covering thousands of employees if such activities were a one-time occurrence?
"It's too bad common-sense policy has to be dictated in this manner," said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "New conduct rules are necessary to preventing more shenanigans from happening in the future, and whether these are the best, and most cost effective, rules to stop future misconduct remains to be seen."
The rules did not mention prostitutes or strip clubs. But they prohibit employees from allowing foreigners, except hotel staff or foreign law enforcement colleagues, into their hotel rooms. They also ban visits to "nonreputable" establishments, which were not defined. The State Department was expected to brief Secret Service employees on trips about areas and businesses considered off-limits to them.
During trips in which the presidential limousine and other bulletproof vehicles are transported by plane, senior-level chaperones will accompany agents and enforce conduct rules, including one from the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility.
The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., praised the new rules as "very positive steps by the Secret Service to make clear what is expected of every agent and also makes clear what will not be tolerated."
The Secret Service has forced eight employees from their jobs and was seeking to revoke the security clearance of another employee, which would effectively force him to resign. Three others have been cleared of serious wrongdoing. The military was conducting its own, separate investigation but canceled the security clearances of all 12 enlisted personnel.
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano assured senator this week that the incident in Colombia appeared to be an isolated case, saying she would be surprised if it represented a broader cultural problem. The next day, the Secret Service acknowledged it was investigating whether its employees hired strippers and prostitutes in advance of Obama's visit last year to El Salvador. Prostitution is legal in both Colombia and El Salvador.
"If they are true, the emergence of these anecdotes about past Secret Service misconduct is precisely why our committee will be trying to determine if such behavior is widespread," said Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., who heads the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The committee has asked Sullivan for information "related to misconduct by agents on assignment," he said.
In a confidential message to senators on Thursday, the Secret Service said its Office of Professional Responsibility had not received complaints about officer behavior in El Salvador but would investigate.
On Capitol Hill, early signs surfaced of eroding support for the Secret Service director. Grassley said Sullivan's job could be secure if the scandal were an isolated incident. "But if it goes much deeper, you know, nothing happens or nothing's changed in Washington if heads don't roll," Grassley said on CBS "This Morning."
The White House said the president remained supportive of Sullivan and confident in the capabilities of the Secret Service.

BEIRUT — The head of the U.N. observer mission in Syria on Sunday called on President Bashar Assad and the country's opposition to stop fighting and allow a tenuous cease-fire to take hold.
Maj. Gen. Robert Mood spoke after arriving in the Syrian capital, Damascus, to take charge of an advance team of 16 U.N. monitors trying to salvage an international peace plan to end the country's 13-month-old crisis.
Under the plan, a cease-fire is supposed to lead to talks between Assad and the opposition on a political solution to a conflict that has killed more than 9,000 people.
On Sunday, at least 25 people were killed, including 14 civilians shot dead by troops in a village in central Syria, and three soldiers killed in a clash with army defectors, activists said.
Mood told reporters that the 300 observers the U.N. has authorized for the mission "cannot solve all the problems" in Syria, asking for cooperation from forces loyal to Assad as well as rebels seeking to end his rule.
"We want to have combined efforts focusing on the welfare of the Syrian people," he said, "true cessation of violence in all its forms."
The cease-fire began unraveling almost as soon as it went into effect April 12. The regime has kept up its attacks on opposition strongholds, while rebel fighters have continued to ambush government security forces. Defying a major truce provision, the Syrian military has failed to withdraw tanks and soldiers from city streets.
Despite the violence, the truce still enjoys the support of the international community, largely because it views the plan as the last chance to prevent the country from falling into civil war – and because it does not want to intervene militarily.
Jakob Kellenberger, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said that while he is still hopeful, "unfortunately, I am also aware how much this plan is at risk."
"That's why it's especially important for this mission to expand quickly," Kellenberger told the Swiss newspaper Der Sonntag. He met with Syrian leaders earlier this month.
Most analysts say the plan has little chance of succeeding, though it could temporarily bring down the level of daily violence.
That has largely been the case in Homs, Syria's third largest city, which has emerged as the heart of the uprising. Regime forces pounded parts of Homs for months, leaving large swaths of the city in ruins, before two U.N. monitors moved into an upscale hotel there last week.
Since then, the level of violence has dropped, although gunbattles still frequently break out. "The shooting has not stopped in Homs," local activist Tarek Badrakhan said Sunday.
An amateur video posted online Saturday showed the observers walking through a heavily damaged neighborhood, where residents collected a body lying in the street and put it in the back of a pickup truck.
Mood, a Norwegian, was appointed head of the observer mission by U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon. One hundred monitors should be in the country by mid-May, said mission spokesman Neeraj Singh. It is unclear when or if the full contingent of 300 monitors will deploy to Syria.
Mood brings a wealth of Middle East experience to the job, including stints with U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon in 1989-1990 and as the head of a U.N. peacekeeping mission known as UNTSO from 2009 to 2011. That mission was the U.N's first-ever peacekeeping operation, starting after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war to monitor a cease-fire. It now watches cease-fires around the Middle East.
The Syrian state news agency said observers visited the embattled Homs neighborhood of Khaldiyeh on Sunday but provided no further information.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said government snipers shot and killed two people in the neighborhood of Joret al-Shayah, which borders Khaldiyeh.
The group said an additional 20 people were killed by troops, including 14 in the village of Hamadi Omar in the central Hama province and a child in the southern province of Deir el-Zour. Also Sunday, three Syrian soldiers were killed in clashes with army defectors, it said.
Ban has blamed the regime for widespread violations of the truce – prompting Syria to fire back that his comments were "outrageous" and accuse him of bias.
The spat has further stoked concerns among the Syrian opposition and its Western supporters that Assad is merely playing for time to avoid compliance with a plan that – if fully implemented – would likely sweep him out of office.

Russia Condemns Massacre
Russia says international envoy Kofi Annan will visit Moscow on Monday to discuss the ongoing crisis in Syria. Russia also called for an inquiry into an alleged massacre that took place in the village of Tramseh on Thursday. "We have no doubt that this wrongdoing serves the interests of those powers that are not seeking peace but persistently seek to sow the seeds of interconfessional and civilian conflict on Syrian soil," Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement, according to Reuters. Moscow did not apportion blame for the killings. Read more on Reuters.com.

How Do Syrian Fighters Get Their Arms?
How do Syria's fighters get their arms? An overview put together by Reuters explains that there are three gateways to the country -- Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq.
Syrian rebels are smuggling small arms into Syria through a network of land and sea routes involving cargo ships and trucks moving through Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq, maritime intelligence and Free Syrian Army (FSA) officers say.
Western and regional powers deny any suggestion they are involved in gun running. Their interest in the sensitive border region lies rather in screening to ensure powerful weapons such as surface to air missiles do not find their way to Islamist or other militants.

Hama Revolutionary Council: More Than 220 Killed
According to the Hama Revolutionary Council, a Syrian opposition group, more than 220 people have been killed in a new alleged massacre in Taramseh. Earlier reports said more than 100 people were killed. "More than 220 people fell today in Taramseh," the Council said in a statement. "They died from bombardment by tanks and helicopters, artillery shelling and summary executions."
Fadi Sameh, an opposition activist from Taramseh, told Reuters he had left the town before the reported massacre but was in touch with residents. "It appears that Alawite militiamen from surrounding villages descended on Taramseh after its rebel defenders pulled out, and started killing the people. Whole houses have been destroyed and burned from the shelling," Sameh claimed.

Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge looks on during the medal ceremony for Men's Discus Throw - F42 on day 4 of the London 2012 Paralympic Games at Olympic Stadium on September 2, 2012 in London, England.
While the Olympics and Paralympics aspire to transcend international divisions, cultural and political differences can still become visible. This was the case when Iranian Paralympian Mehrdad Karam Zadeh opted not to shake hands with Kate Middleton after receiving a silver medal in the discus at the London Paralympics on Sunday, according to the Daily Mail and various reports. The 40-year-old discus competitor kept his hands clasped to his chest after receiving his silver medal from the Duchess of Cambridge, who had been shaking hands with winners after presenting their medals. Zadeh won silver with a personal best toss of 44.62 meters. According to The Sun, Zadeh would have accepted a congratulatory handshake from a man.
"Many male athletes from Islamic countries do not shake hands in public with women they are not related to for cultural and religious reasons," a representative for the 30-year-old royal told Us Weekly in a statement. "The Duchess was informed in advance and was happy to accept his wishes. She considered it an honor to present the medals."
The gold medalist in the F42 discus classification, Aled Davis of Great Britain, was far more thrilled to meet Kate. @AledDavies2012
Aled Davies
Was lovely to meet the duchess! Was an honour! Such a lovely person! Crazy to think I'm a Paralympic champion! #SayWhat http://t.co/pGLm2UuB

Last week, as part of the pledge process, members of the Yale chapter of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (DKE) led prospective members across campus chanting, among other obscenities "No means YES! Yes means ANAL!" under the windows of freshman dormitories. That night, members of the Yale Women's Center helped to coordinate the outrage that was being expressed across campus and published an op-ed condemning the chants.
The editorial board of the Yale Daily News responded with an editorial placing blame squarely on... the Women's Center.
Often, the boisterous will stop at nothing to get a rise out of others -- especially when they know just the right buttons to push. Last Wednesday, the pledges of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity issued just such a provocation. As they chanted their way across campus, the rest of us were forced to listen to tasteless jibes involving obscenity, jingoism and necrophilia.
But then came the coup-de-grace: "No means yes, yes means anal." By making light of rape, the pledges crossed a line. In this newspaper's view, the chanting was idiotic and offensive, and it should not be repeated.
And yet, as groups rushed to condemn the foolhardy DKE bros, they threw overwrought epithets, some almost as absurd as the chants themselves... As the Center responded with histrionics, what could have been an opportunity for our campus to maturely and gracefully reprove public stupidity and affirm mutual respect turned into a daylong, private spat. Thankfully, students responded to this editorial, disputing its characterization of the Women's Center as histrionic and taking issue with the weasel words that seem to absolve the DKE brothers of culpability ('boisterous' 'provocateurs'). Even after the YDN printed a half-hearted clarification (in the increasingly common "Sorry that people chose to take offense" framing), one of their major errors remains uncorrected.
The YDN editorial board puts the onus of defusing the controversy on the people who were wronged. Even worse, they assume that, when faced with abusive and offensive speech, women ought to be trying to defuse the situation to begin with. The goal of women and the Women's Center is not to 'gracefully reprove public stupidity' and then move on, but to change the blasé attitudes about sexual assault that caused DKE to think this chant was acceptable in the first place. The fact that the controversy has not settled down is a victory, not a loss.
The Yale Women's Center and women are not required to mute their criticism of aggressively misogynist speech out of fear of offending the transgressors. Responsibility for creating a helpful dialogue and a teachable moment can't be assigned solely to the wronged party. If the only way to engage the DKE boys in dialogue is to ignore the gravity of their offence, as the YDN was inclined to do, nothing would be gained. Minimizing the problem to the point of insignificance is not a victory.
The Women's Center is an advocacy group pushing for the radical goal of equal and respectful treatment of women on campus. If that position makes it awkward for the Women's Center to step into the role of moderator during campus controversies, the Yale administration should take an active role managing the discussion, rather than leaving it to students to resolve in a strange attempt at neutrality.
Leadership doesn't have to take the form of disciplinary action, but the Yale administration could be doing a lot more to establish expectations for acceptable conduct on campus and in civil society. It's a shame that the a cappella rush at Yale is conducted with clearer, more frequently enforced rules than the fraternity pledge process, especially when this is the second time in two years that a fraternity has made public, aggressive misogynist behavior a part of their recruitment pitch.
The worst thing Yale could do would be to follow the YDN's lead and decide vocal controversy and outrage is the problem that needs to be resolved, rather than the offensive behavior that provoked it.
