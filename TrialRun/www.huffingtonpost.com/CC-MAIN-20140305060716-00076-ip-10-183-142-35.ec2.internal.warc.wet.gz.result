The NY Times reports today on the arrest of Pakistan opposition leader Imran Khan: The opposition politician Imran Khan emerged from hiding today to the cheers of hundreds of students at a protest demonstration against Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, at a university here and was quickly seized by hard-line students and turned over to the police, witnesses said.
Imran Khan, in addition to being a popular politician, spanned eastern and western social circuits through his marriage to British heiress Jemima Khan (nee Goldsmith), a woman most recently in the headlines for her relationship with actor Hugh Grant.

Politics News
Vice President Joe Biden reportedly took a hit at former Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.) Thursday during a rooftop party for Rep. Patrick Murphy, who defeated West in the 2012 election.
"I'd like to say to all of you, you did the country a favor," Biden told the crowd at Murphy's party, according to TCPalm.
Despite results showing West trailing Murphy by 1,900 votes, West refused to concede the election, suggesting "disturbing irregularities reported at polls" affected the outcome. It wasn't until two weeks after the election that he finally conceded while still insisting on "inaccuracies in the results." "While a contest of the election results might have changed the vote totals, we do not have evidence that the outcome would change," West said.
Though West is no longer a member of Congress, he's still seeing support from some Republican peers. Reps. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) -- two of the House's most outspoken conservatives -- voted for West as Speaker of the House at the start of the new Congress Thursday.

What's up dog?
This pooch knows how to back it up. OK, he may have a skin infection or a couple of fleas, but this is hilarious anyway. Someone caught him on camera busting his freak-nasty moves to Eminem's "Shake That," and the pup bounces in time to the tune.
He really brings down the dog house. Make sure you turn up the speakers for this:

The Saint Bernard dog was once the ubiquitous companion of monks at the monastery tucked 2,500m above sea level, guiding them through the Alps or helping them to rescue stranded or lost travellers in the snowy mountains. However, there are no longer any such dogs living permanently at the monastery these days. In fact, the monks decided five years ago to part ways with their pedigree breeding programme, as the work became too much for the four monks living permanently at the monastery to handle. The breeding kennels faced the risk of being shut permanently if not for a group of Swiss bankers and animal-lovers who set up the Barry Foundation to buy the breeding programme.

The Simple Difference: Close Cultural and Linguistic Gaps to Save Lives of Hispanics
Juan Carlos Caicedo, M.D.
Assistant Professor of Surgery and Director of the Hispanic Transplant Program, Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine	Your life should not depend on your ability to understand the doctor's written instructions. Simply not having a Spanish-speaking health care provider answering critical care questions can mean a patient will suffer and likely die. This is a problem getting bigger every day.

How I Reclaimed My Health
Harper Spero
Managing Director at Agent of Change	Over the past year I've started to take control of my own health. I've been going to yoga three times a week, eating healthier, making juice every morning and figuring out like-minded alternatives to living a better lifestyle with an immune deficiency.
Comments Type 1 Diabetes Finally Explained
Riva Greenberg
Diabetes advocate, author, speaker and coach	I got diabetes in February 1972 when I was 18 years old. I'm now 60. I've had diabetes more than four decades, more than two-thirds of my life. I have no memory of what life was like before "staying between the lines."
Comments (20) How I Stayed On Track on Vacation
Shealagh Whittle
Blogger	As my countdown to vacation crept closer and closer, I got a little scared -- how could I continue my newfound healthy eating habits in a city that for me holds all manner of delectable culinary sins?The answers turned out to be simple, and despite the fact that I have been largely ignoring my scale over the past month or two, I actually lost weight while I was in London.
Comments Autism Without Fear: In the Autism World, Maybe You Just ARE a Bad Parent
Michael John Carley
When a stranger gives you a dirty look because your child is upset in the supermarket, you might dissolve in shame, or you might confront the dirty-look perpetrator. But neither response is right. If your child is upset, he needs and deserves your attention more than that stranger.
Comments 10 Reasons I'm a Funeral Director
Caleb Wilde
Sixth generation licensed funeral director	Perhaps there's no greater freedom than to live life with a healthy relationship with death. That healthy relationship allows you embracing each moment, realizing that we are not promised tomorrow. This good relationship with death has been given to me by the funeral profession.
Comments Women: Our Disease Is Perfection
Dr. Amy Shah
Double board certified in Internal Medicine and Allergy & Immunology	In order for us to continue to advance in the workplace and home, we must literally and figuratively remove the airbrushed media images of female success and tame our own unrealistic expectations for ourselves.
Comments My Drug and Alcohol History Reads Like a Sad Handwritten Book
Allison Hudson
Blogger, www.itsalushlife.com	By the time I acknowledged my defeat, I had two choices. I could continue on the road I was on, unwilling to accept help, eventually ending with death, or I could accept help, admitting I was powerless over alcohol and begin a road of recovery. I chose the latter.
Comments The Next Transformation in American Healthcare
Brian Castrucci
Chief Program and Strategy Officer, de Beaumont Foundation	The crisis in American healthcare today is the ascendance of chronic conditions, which can't be fixed with a pill or procedure. We are seeing a transition from predominantly biological, physiological, and microbial origins of disease to diseases caused by social and environmental conditions.
Comments When Your Body Says 'No More Screens'
Lori Leibovich
Executive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post	It hurts to do my job, lift my daughter, carry grocery bags, or make it through the day without popping Advils. The message my body is sending is clear: Stop typing, tapping and scrolling, now.
Comments March Is National Kidney Month: Let's Get Back to Basics
Leslie Spry, M.D., FACP
National Kidney Foundation spokesperson; Medical director, Dialysis Center of Lincoln, Neb.	Kidney Disease kills more people each year than breast and prostate cancer combined. Yes, you read that statistic correctly, but you may be surprised by it.
Comments The Toughest Race My Daughter and I Ever Ran
Andi Sligh
Author, There's Sunshine Behind the Clouds	It's hard to believe that it was so hard for her, when in the past it's been (relatively) easy. But when the pain of the day had subsided just a bit, I recalled one of the mantras of slow distance runners: "Dead Last Finish is greater than Did Not Finish, which trumps Did Not Start."
Comments A Picture Day Moment
Ariane Zurcher
Writer & Blogger: Emma's Hope Book, Where Art & Life Meet	Teachers are trained in a definition of autism that is incorrect. A definition that includes and assumes intellectual disability, which is connected to an inability to make oneself understood, low IQ, problematic behaviors and social impairment.
Comments Cloudy With a Chance of Meatheads
David Katz, M.D.
Director, Yale Prevention Research Center	As long we impart to nutrition the mediagenic volatility associated with the weather, we can all but guarantee that our understanding of what is good for us will remain very much clouded over. There will also be a very high chance of us acting like meatheads -- and being fed a steady diet of headlines accordingly.
Comments It's Your Choice: Creating Opportunity Where You Least Expect
Carol J. Carter
Author and student success expert	Our hardiness, grit, adaptability, and perspective are some of the ways we can use these unwanted circumstances as an opportunity to help us fulfill our goals. A great example of a person who turned his circumstance into opportunity is Woody Roseland.
Comments Do Brain Games Really Boost Brain Power?
Sandra Bond Chapman, Ph.D.
Cognitive neuroscientist; Founder and Chief Director, Center for BrainHealth, University of Texas at Dallas	With all the buzz about brain games -- such as crossword puzzles, Sudoku, and even brain training websites -- it begs the question: Can brain games be beneficial to brain health? As a cognitive neuroscientist, this is a question I get asked a lot. And the answer is yes and no.
Comments (19) Adhering to CPAP Therapy Takes Perseverance, Accommodations, and Expertise
Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine
On detailed questioning he reported the full-face mask was, "just too big, leaked too much, and left marks on his face." He was never told that masks are available in different sizes and, more importantly, can come in different styles, including nasal pillows and nasal triangular devices.
Comments Warning: Your Compliment to That Pregnant Woman Was an Insult
Catherine Alford
Founder, www.BudgetBlonde.com	When will female bodies just be left alone? Must we always be on display for everyone to see, judge, measure and discuss? Is it really that difficult to offer a kind word to each other?
Comments (13) It Doesn't Matter What My Daughter Looks Like
Kate Fridkis
Author of Growing Eden, blogger at Eat the Damn Cake	It's weird to think that I started out like this, too. That we all do. A brilliant jumble of sensors sensing excitedly all at once.
