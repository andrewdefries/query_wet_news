MoveOn.org will enter the debate over torture investigations on Tuesday, asking its members to call on Attorney General Eric Holder to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the architects of the Bush administration's program of detainee torture. The foray represents a new direction for MoveOn, which has previously been focused on pushing the progressive agenda - the stimulus, Obama's budget, healthcare, cap and trade - through Congress. Groups to MoveOn's left have long been critical of the organization for not making investigations and prosecutions of Bush-era criminal activity a top priority. The call for a special prosecutor adds MoveOn's rather loud voice to the growing chorus demanding that crimes be investigated. It's also an indication that the call for accountability for those who committed crimes during the Bush administration is becoming a mainstream Democratic position, and one the White House will find harder to move past. The group will only deliver the petition to Holder, however, if it gathers 200,000 signatures, making the call a test of the appetite of the progressive base for investigations.
On Monday, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), a senior Democrat on the judiciary committee, called for the impeachment of Jay Bybee, one of the authors of the torture memos and now a federal judge. MoveOn makes the case that without consequences for breaking the law, rogue behavior is only encouraged. "So far there's been no accountability for the architects of Bush's torture program -- the top officials who justified keeping detainees awake for 11 days straight, waterboarding them repeatedly, and forcing prisoners into coffin-like boxes with insects," reads the letter from MoveOn to its members. "We need real consequences for those responsible -- it's the only way to keep this from happening again."
The full letter:
Subject: Bush's torture Dear MoveOn member,
On Thursday, President Obama released memos that describe, in horrific detail, the torture techniques authorized by the Bush administration. The memos make clear that top Bush officials didn't just condone torture -- they encouraged it.
So far there's been no accountability for the architects of Bush's torture program -- the top officials who justified keeping detainees awake for 11 days straight, waterboarding them repeatedly, and forcing prisoners into coffin-like boxes with insects.1
We need real consequences for those responsible -- it's the only way to keep this from happening again. Attorney General Holder can open an investigation into the torture program -- but he most likely won't unless people everywhere speak up and demand it.
Can you sign our petition to Attorney General Eric Holder asking him to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the torture program? If we can reach 200,000 signatures, we'll deliver the petition to Holder by the end of the week. Clicking here will sign your name:
http://pol.moveon.org/torture/
The petition says: "No one is above the law. It's time to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute the architects of the Bush-era torture program."
Calls for action, from the United Nations, the ACLU, Amnesty International,2 Senators Leahy and Feingold, and others, are gathering steam. The New York Times made the case for accountability yesterday:3
"...[Obama] has an obligation to pursue what is clear evidence of a government policy sanctioning the torture and abuse of prisoners "in violation of international law and the Constitution." This isn't about retribution or politics. It's about accountability. If hundreds of thousands of us speak up, we can make sure Holder hears this loud and clear.
Thanks for all you do.

Manhole Cover Thief Andrew Modica Stole To Feed Drug Habit

New York News
A man was arrested on Wednesday for his connection to the disappearance of several manhole covers across the city, and confessed he stole the covers in order to feed a drug addiction.
The New York Post reports that 46-year old Andrew Modica has been charged with criminal possession of stolen property and criminal impersonation. Earlier this month, witnesses reported spotting thieves donning utility-style clothing-- without Con Edison's official label-- prying away at the manhole covers and surreptitiously packing them into trucks. More than 30 manhole covers have gone missing since early March, Reuters reports. A Con Edison representative said, "Stealing manhole covers is dangerous. Anyone who steals these covers creates a serious hazard for pedestrians and motorists."
But is the danger worth the booty? Probably not. According to Modica, who told The Post he uses the money to purchase crack, cocaine, and heroin, a 320-pound manhole cover could fetch up between 12.5 to 15 cents per pound, which amounts to a rather measly $40 to $48 per steal. Replacing a manhole costs $200.
Modica admitted to some of the thefts but insists he's innocent when it comes to other missing covers. Contribute to this Story: Send us a tip

In spite of self-publishing gaining more respectability, there are still those who feel it is a waste of money for authors to go that route. Just this week alone I have come across a couple of cynics who believe that struggling writers are foolish and being taken advantage of by this type of publishing. I've stated in past articles that I was once one of these critics, but times have changed and so has my opinion.
The thing is, I wonder why there isn't much protest for the musician who pays to record his or her music because they cannot get a record deal. They, too, have to compromise in order to try to make it in the business and spend their own money to try to get any sort of recognition. Not every musician, though, takes the risk that Montreal's Bernard Lachance did when he spent thousands of dollars, which was his life savings, and rented out the Chicago Theater and then made a You Tube video inviting Oprah to come see him. Risky, indeed, and Oprah was unable to attend his concert. But don't feel too sad for this dreamer because instead Oprah hosted this young man on her show where he sang The Impossible Dream. What if Lachance listened to reason, though, and decided to use his money for something more sensible? Well, he'd probably be like so many others who die without trying and that, in my opinion, is tragic.
Author Jason A. Spencer Edwards did not want to die without trying. In today's New York Times there is an article about how he self-published his novels and is reaching his audience using viral marketing. Edwards has been so successful that he was able to quit his job as a paralegal and is publishing other authors--this after he and a fellow paralegal invested $25,000 of their own money to found JASP Publishing in order to publish his first novel, Jiggy. This is one person who didn't let traditional publishing keep him from realizing his dream. Of course, not everyone has $25,000 to invest, but not every writer needs that kind of money to get their book in print.
Granted, there are some shady printing companies that take advantage of the unsuspecting writer while making promises of fame and fortune, which makes it bad for self-publishers. But it's the writer who educates him or herself and has realistic expectations who can actually accomplish what they set out to do, thanks to this relatively new publishing paradigm that is gaining speed and respectability.
As I stated earlier, I had been one of those who initially thought self-publishers took advantage of those desperate to see their writing in print, but iUniverse gave me an opportunity that would have been lost otherwise. Originally, I was fortunate enough to acquire a literary agent, a high-profile literary agent, for my novel Without Grace, but unfortunate that this agent turned out to be less than aggressive in shopping it around. When another high-profile agent stepped in and wanted a chance with it, this first agent suddenly came up with a long list of publishers where she'd ostensibly sent it, even though there were no letters of rejection as proof. The second agent then couldn't take the chance professionally of resubmitting the same novel; therefore, Without Grace was left to sit on a shelf unread...until Susan Driscoll, former iUniverse CEO, had her editor read it and asked if they could publish it gratis. Due to the novel's success, she then hired me to write The Author's Guide to Planning Book Events. True, money didn't come out of my pocket for this venture, but I see what self-publishing can do and I'm now one of its biggest advocates. Yet, there are still those who don't realize that without this opportunity, writers would not have the joy of seeing their book in print. Without a doubt, some of these books are in sad shape and do compromise self-publishing's reputation. Yet, we must remember that many authors started out self-published, authors like Henry David Thoreau, Ernest Hemingway and Deepak Chopra, and that's pretty good company to be in. So if an author who cannot acquire a traditional publishing deal decides to invest in their writing career by self-publishing instead of giving up, let's celebrate their passion and entrepreneurial spirit and appreciate that self-publishing has allowed them to realize their dream before it's too late.

Understanding CBO's Minimum-Wage Report
Scott Lilly
Senior fellow, Center for American Progress
As the uproar over the CBO analysis demonstrates, the issue of whether jobs are gained or lost as a result of a minimum-wage increase depends largely on how we analyze the vast amount of research that has been conducted on the question over the past half-century.
