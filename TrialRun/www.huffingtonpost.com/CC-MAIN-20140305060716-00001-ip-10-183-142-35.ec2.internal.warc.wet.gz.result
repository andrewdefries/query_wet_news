Romney-Ryan Medicare Plan Would Cost 29-Year-Olds $331,200: Report

Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan's health care plan would raise Americans' health care costs during retirement, according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress.
If Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have their way, then Americans of all ages may be spending more on health care during their retirement. If Romney becomes president and repeals the Affordable Care Act as promised, then retirement would cost $11,100 more for the average 65-year-old and $18,600 more for the average 55-year-old because of higher Medicare premiums and drug costs, according to a report from Harvard economist David Cutler, an Obamacare architect, and the Center for American Progress. What's more, seniors on Medicare who depend on Medicaid would need to pay more than $2,500 more per year because of planned Medicaid cuts.
Romney's plan would cost younger Americans even more, since Romney and Ryan want to turn Medicare into a voucher system for Americans under 55 for when they qualify for Medicare. The report estimates that 48-year-olds would have to pay $124,600 more for Medicare during retirement under Romney's plan, 39-year-olds would have to pay $216,600 more during retirement, and 29-year-olds would have to pay $331,200 more during retirement in total. That's because the vouchers would not keep up with rising health care costs. For those 29-year-olds, the extra costs would consume 62 percent of their lifetime Social Security benefits.
Romney's plan also would make health care more expensive for the seniors that need it the most. Since healthier seniors would likely choose private insurance plans, which would be cheaper for them, the sicker seniors that opt for traditional Medicare would be forced to pay an estimated $29,000 more during the course of their retirement, according to the report.
For his part, Romney claims that the Affordable Care act is a tax increase and hurts job creation at small businesses. He also claims that more competition among health care plans would lead to lower premiums.
But the promise of lower premiums is a fantasy, according to Peter Orszag, a former budget director for President Obama. Orszag recently said that Ryan's plan relies on the "health care competition tooth fairy" and would shift costs to consumers from the government, rather than reducing costs overall.

Wealthy Benefit Most From Tax CutsPaul Ryan's most recent budget proposal would save those making between $20,000 and $30,000 just $246 in taxes, compared to savings of $265,011 for those who make over $1 million, according to analysis from the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2012/04/02/gIQAjn0grS_graphic.html" target="_hplink">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>.Health Care CutsThe "Path to Prosperity" would cut $2.4 trillion from Medicaid and other health care programs for people with low or moderate incomes, according to analysis from the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2012/04/02/gIQAjn0grS_graphic.html" target="_hplink">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>.Fewer People Covered By MedicaidUnder Ryan's "Path to Prosperity" as many as 44 million fewer people would be covered under Medicaid, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7417870n" target="_hplink">according to CBS News</a>.Reduced Health Care For RetireesRyan would raise the age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 67. If the Affordable Care Act was repealed, something Romney has pledged, that means many 65- and 66-year-olds would be left uninsured, the <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/08/11/seven-things-the-media-needs-to-know-about-paul/189277" target="_hplink">CBPP reports</a>.Seniors Would Pay More For Health CoverageUnder Ryan's "Path to Prosperity," senior citizens would have to pay as much as 68 percent of their health care coverage, up from 25 percent today, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7417870n" target="_hplink">CBS News reports.</a> Cuts To Food Stamp ProgramsRyan's proposed "Path to Prosperity" includes $134 billion in cuts to SNAP, according to analysis from the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2012/04/02/gIQAjn0grS_graphic.html" target="_hplink">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>.Lower Tax Credit For Single MomsA single mother of two working full time at the minimum wage would have her Child Tax Credit cut by more than $1,500, assuming she made $14,500 a year, according to the <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/08/11/seven-things-the-media-needs-to-know-about-paul/189277" target="_hplink">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>.Less Money For Education Compared to the most recent White House budget proposal, Ryan's budget spends 33 percent less on education, training, employment and social services, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/12/what-paul-ryans-budget-actually-cuts-and-by-how-much/" target="_hplink">the <em>Washington Post</em> reports</a>.Poor Weather ForecastsRyan's proposed cuts to environment and natural resource programs could result in weather forecasts being only half as accurate, according to Third Way's budget expert, David Kendall. "For many people planning a weekend outdoors, they may have to wait until Thursday for a forecast as accurate as one they now get on Monday," <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/12/what-paul-ryans-budget-actually-cuts-and-by-how-much/" target="_hplink">he's quoted as saying in the <em>Washington Post</em></a>.No Raises For Government WorkersThe current government worker pay freeze would be extended under the "Path to Prosperity," meaning public-sector employees wouldn't get a raise until at least 2015, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/paul-ryans-budget-plan-hits-federal-workers/2012/08/11/8953b832-e3a3-11e1-98e7-89d659f9c106_blog.html" target="_hplink">the <em>Washington Post</em> reports</a>.

LOS ANGELES — HBO says the Laura Dern series "Enlightened" isn't coming back for a third season.
In a statement Tuesday, the premium cable channel said it was proud of the show, and called canceling it a "very difficult decision."
"Enlightened," created by Dern and her co-star Mike White, was critically acclaimed but low-rated.
Last year, Dern won a Golden Globe for best TV comedy actress for her role as a manic-depressive who becomes an activist. The "Enlightened" cast also included Diane Ladd and Luke Wilson

<strong>Why</strong>: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/16/last-resort-canceled-abc_n_2147316.html">ABC killed the Shawn Ryan drama</a> in late 2012."Malibu Country"<strong>"Malibu Country," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Canceled
<strong>Why</strong>: "Malibu Country" had been performing well on Friday nights, but the ratings took a dip and there was also showrunner switches that are never a good. "The Middle"<strong>"The Middle," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: Now in its fourth season, "The Middle" is still pulling in more than 8 million viewers an episode as the anchor of ABC's Wednesday comedies."Mistresses"<strong>"Mistresses," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Too soon to tell
<strong>Why</strong>: The drama, which is based on the UK series of the same name, just got a Monday, May 27 premiere date. Though the scheduling struggle doesn't bode well, the ABC drama does have Alyssa Milano and "Lost" alum Yunjin Kim leading the foursome."Modern Family"<strong>"Modern Family," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: A fan favorite and Emmy darling, "Modern Family" will be back and will make ABC lots of money in syndication."Nashville"<strong>"Nashville," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: Critical acclaim doesn't always equate to rating success, but ABC still believes in this Connie Britton-fronted drama despite the numbers."The Neighbors"<strong>"The Neighbors," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: One of the few "hits" of the season, "The Neighbors" has found an audience and kept it pretty steadily week after week (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/11/abc-shows-fall-tv-2012-2013_n_1581796.html">much to our dismay</a>)."Once Upon a Time"<strong>"Once Upon a Time," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: A ratings hit in its second season, "Once Upon a Time" will be back for a third season full of fairytale adventures."Private Practice"<strong>"Private Practice," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Ended
<strong>Why</strong>: The "Grey's Anatomy" spinoff said goodbye in January 2013."Red Widow"<strong>"Red Widow," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Canceled
<strong>Why</strong>: The show had a late February debut on ABC and the ratings were abysmal."Revenge"<strong>"Revenge," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: "Revenge" has fallen out of critical favor and seen lower ratings in its new Sunday night home. Though it lost its creator Mike Kelley as the showrunner, it will return for a third season, considering the sad state of ABC's dramas."Rookie Blue"<strong>"Rookie Blue," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: The Canadian co-production will return for a fourth season on ABC during the summer of 2013."Scandal"<strong>"Scandal," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: Shonda Rhimes has another hit on her hands. Now in its second season, "Scandal" has benefited from word-of-mouth and has been rising in the ratings (even recently beating out its lead in "Grey's Anatomy"). A likable star -- Kerry Washington -- and continued buzz keep "Scandal" on the schedule."Suburgatory"<strong>"Suburgatory," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: The series started Season 2 off strong in the ratings, but its audience has slowly eroded. Still, the show will be back for a third season."Zero Hour"<strong>"Zero Hour," ABC</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Canceled
<strong>Why</strong>: The Anthony Edwards vehicle debuted to 6.3 million viewers with a 1.3 rating in the key 18-49 demographic, making it <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/15/zero-hour-ratings_n_2695800.html">the least-watched premiere for a scripted series in ABC's history</a>. Things only got worse from there."2 Broke Girls"<strong>"2 Broke Girls," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: CBS renewed "2 Broke Girls" in March of 2013."The Amazing Race"<strong>"The Amazing Race," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: As an Emmy and fan favorite, "The Amazing Race" has been a strong player for CBS."The Big Bang Theory"<strong>"The Big Bang Theory," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: Now in its sixth season, "Big Bang" is reaching series-high ratings. Even up against reality powerhouse "American Idol," "The Big Bang Theory" has been delivering with crazy high numbers in the 18-49 demographic, beating out what was once Fox's juggernaut."Blue Bloods"<strong>"Blue Bloods," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: The Tom Selleck-fronted police drama is a strong ratings performer for CBS on Fridays."Criminal Minds"<strong>"Criminal Minds," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: As one of CBS's strong procedural players, the series has been steady in the ratings and will likely be renewed to help anchor a night and launch a new drama."CSI"<strong>"CSI," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: Of the two "CSI" shows on the air, "CSI" is the stronger player in the TV landscape. The show is nowhere near its earlier ratings, but Ted Danson signed on for more and the show will be back."CSI: NY"<strong>"CSI: NY," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Canceled
<strong>Why</strong>: The ratings from this "CSI" spinoff have faded over the years."Elementary"<strong>"Elementary," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: One of the very few freshman series hits during the 2012-2013 TV season, CBS is very keen on this modern-day take on Sherlock Holmes. The audience has been steady and the network even gave it the post-Super Bowl timeslot."Golden Boy"<strong>"Golden Boy," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Canceled
<strong>Why</strong>: CBS certainly has a handsome star at the front of this cop drama, but its late season entry hinted toward CBS's confidence in the show."The Good Wife"<strong>"The Good Wife," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: A former ratings champ, "The Good Wife" has slipped to series low ratings on Sunday nights. Blame football overrun, fan-detested storylines or too many guest stars, but "The Good Wife" has star power and critical praise, plus its nearing a good syndication sweet spot."Hawaii Five-0"<strong>"Hawaii Five-0," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: In March, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/27/the-good-wife-renewed-season-5_n_2965829.html" target="_hplink">CBS announced "Hawaii Five-0" received an early renewal along with several of its other popular programs</a>."How I Met Your Mother"<strong>"How I Met Your Mother," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: CBS handed out a ninth and final season to this comedy with the entire cast returning. Expect to meet the mother, finally."Made In Jersey"<strong>"Made In Jersey," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Canceled
<strong>Why</strong>: CBS pulled the plug on this legal drama very early on in the season because of low ratings."The Mentalist"<strong>"The Mentalist," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: "The Mentalist" has fallen to mediocre ratings -- by CBS standards -- but it was nonetheless renewed in March of 2013."Mike & Molly"<strong>"Mike & Molly," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: The ratings are down a little bit from last year, but Melissa McCarthy's star continues to rise."NCIS"<strong>"NCIS," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: CBS reached a deal with series star Mark Harmon in early 2013, keeping the No. 1 show in America around for a Season 11."NCIS: LA"<strong>"NCIS: LA," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: Viewers love their "NCIS," in any form. The ratings have been strong and the network is producing a backdoor spinoff pilot for this spinoff show. A full night of "NCIS" could be in CBS's future."Partners"<strong>"Partners," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Canceled
<strong>Why</strong>: Low ratings and unfavorable reviews led to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/16/partners-canceled-cbs_n_2145832.html">early demise</a> of this CBS comedy."Person of Interest"<strong>"Person of Interest," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: The series has developed a nice-sized audience, bigger than its first season.
"Rules of Engagement"<strong>"Rules of Engagement," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Canceled
<strong>Why</strong>: This comedy has been on the bubble since it premiered ... yet it made it to Season 7. It's finally time to say goodbye."Survivor"<strong>"Survivor," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: A strong player for the last 13 years, "Survivor" will be back. But due to its <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/survivor-ratings-lowest-premiere-ever_n_2687591.html">most recent premiere ratings</a>, we might not see it during the fall season, though a midseason or summer return -- with some new gimmick -- is definitely in the cards for the reality series."Two and a Half Men"<strong>"Two and a Half Men," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: CBS always wanted another season of this bawdy hit, it was just a matter of getting its stars to sign back on. Though Jon Cryer and Ashton Kutcher will be back for a Season 11, the "half" man Angus T. Jones remains up in the air."Undercover Boss"<strong>"Undercover Boss," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Renewed
<strong>Why</strong>: The show is enjoying life in syndication and its Season 4 numbers are better than most of its third season."Unforgettable"<strong>"Unforgettable," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Uncanceled
<strong>Why</strong>: CBS canceled the Poppy Montgomery drama last season ... and then revived it! Season 2 premieres Sunday, July 28."Vegas"<strong>"Vegas," CBS</strong>
<strong>Status</strong>: Canceled
<strong>Why</strong>: Despite star power, the series wasn't a breakout hit in the ratings. CBS previously canceled "Unforgettable" (then uncanceled it) last season when it was doing about the same as "Vegas."
