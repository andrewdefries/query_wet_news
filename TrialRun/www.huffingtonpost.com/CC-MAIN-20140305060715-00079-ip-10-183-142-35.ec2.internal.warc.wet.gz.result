WASHINGTON — A gay rights activist in Uganda, where a bill that would punish gays with prison or death has stirred worldwide outrage, received the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award in Washington on Thursday.
Ethel Kennedy, the widow of the former U.S. attorney general, was joined by Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry in presenting the award to Frank Mugisha at a ceremony on Capitol Hill. It is the first time the award has been bestowed on an advocate for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights.
"It gives me more courage to continue doing the work I'm doing," Mugisha told The Associated Press ahead of the award. "It sends out a message, not only to my country but to other countries that criminalize homosexuality."
The 29-year-old Mugisha leads the underground group called Sexual Minorities Uganda, whose members routinely shift locations in Uganda for their safety. Uganda, a conservative East African nation, is one of more than 70 nations that have imposed laws against being gay.
Mugisha blames U.S. evangelical activists in particular for stoking fears and promoting homophobia with a 2009 visit and conference on "rehabilitation" for gays in Uganda. Since then, violence against gays has increased, he said.
After the visit, debate began over a Ugandan bill that would punish gay people with prison or death and would threaten jail time for those who don't report suspected gays to authorities. The bill was recently revived in Uganda's parliament.
"I think they are responsible for the bill," Mugisha said of the evangelical activists. "They held a seminar and openly told Ugandans that they needed to tighten their laws on homosexuality and told Ugandans that homosexuals can be healed."
Scott Lively, a preacher who leads a group called Abiding Truth Ministries now based in Springfield, Mass., introduced ideas from the "ex-gay" movement to Ugandans and the idea that gays are "recruited," Mugisha said.
In a telephone interview Wednesday, Lively did not oppose criminalization of gays but said he thinks imprisonment and the death penalty are too harsh. He said many criminal sanctions in African countries are harsh but aren't enforced.
"I advised the Ugandan parliament to focus on rehabilitation and not punishment, which they went the other way on that," Lively said. "But the law that they did draft is consistent with existing law on their books dealing with heterosexual sex crimes, and no one made a peep about that."
Ty Cobb, legislative counsel for the largest U.S. gay rights group, the Human Rights Campaign, said Mugisha is a role model for gays and lesbians in Africa and the world. The group has connected Mugisha with officials at the U.S. State Department.
"It's important to recognize that Frank has put his life on the line to represent this community that's silenced by a government that wants to put you to death for being gay," Cobb said.
Uganda's anti-gay bill – and its connection to U.S. evangelicals – prompted international headlines, editorials and attention from the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. Its award comes with a $30,000 stipend and a six-year partnership to support Mugisha's work with advocacy and fundraising.
Kerry Kennedy, president of the center bearing her father's name, said Mugisha's work shows a rare kind of courage. She said the award is meant for someone who is "the Martin Luther King of their country, somebody who has stood up to government oppression at great personal risk."
She said progressive churches, human rights groups, the U.S. government and the United Nations should take a stronger stand to counter the impact of "right-wing evangelicals" in Uganda.
"What we see here in Uganda is the U.S. exporting our so-called family values," she told the AP. "We bear responsibility for that as a country. We need to set the record straight about what true U.S. values are."
Kennedy said the pursuit of gay rights is consistent with everything her father, the brother of President John F. Kennedy, had stood for.
"I grew up in a family where we believed the United States should stand for something and that it was important to export the U.S. vision of a more just and peaceful world," she said. "That's why Robert Kennedy traveled to South Africa in 1966 when most Americans had never heard of apartheid."
Mugisha said he hopes to persuade other human rights groups to join the struggle for gay rights.
As a young gay activist, Mugisha said he has been beaten and harassed for speaking out. He added that he's not afraid of his government, but rather of the people on the street who want to eliminate gays.
In January, his colleague David Kato was bludgeoned to death. That killing came shortly after a tabloid newspaper published names and photos of men it alleged were gay. The cover included the words, "Hang Them." Authorities had said Kato's sexual orientation had nothing to do with the killing.
On Thursday, Kato's convicted killer was sentenced by a Ugandan court to 30 years in prison. The man said he was provoked by sexual advances he said Kato had made toward him.
Mugisha, reflecting on the Kennedy award, said it may afford some protection by raising his profile.
The biggest motivation to continue his work, despite death threats, is his daily interactions with Ugandan gays and lesbians, he added.
"They just look at you when you talk to them, and they feel there's hope," he said. "They feel there's a voice out there speaking for them."

WATERVILLE, Maine -- A 20-month-old girl who vanished a week before Christmas after being put to bed in her father's home was taken away and didn't walk out on her own, investigators said Monday as they announced the largest reward ever offered in the state to help find a missing person.
It marked the first time since the search for Ayla Reynolds began that police have directly said they don't believe she left the house by herself.
"At this point in the investigation ... we are confident that Ayla did not walk out of the house by herself," Waterville police Chief Joseph Massey said at a news conference at which he announced a $30,000 reward was being offered for help finding her. "We believe that someone was involved in taking her out of the house, and that's where the focus of this investigation has turned."
The reward, gathered with donations from residents and businesses in the Waterville area, is the biggest ever offered in Maine for a missing person, state Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland said.
Massey said the developments in a mystery that's been featured on national television programs have not shifted the matter from a missing-person case to a criminal investigation. Despite the passing of the Christmas holiday with no sign of Ayla, police remain committed to finding her, the chief said.
"The intensity of the investigation is as high today as it was the first day," he said. "We continue to employ every single resource we have."
Massey was joined at the news conference by Waterville attorney John Nale, who appealed for the safe return of Ayla.
"I ask and I plead with the person or persons who have Ayla Reynolds that they please keep her safe and return her safely to us," Nale said.
Hundreds of police officers, game wardens and local residents have been searching for Ayla since she was reported missing by her father, Justin DiPietro, on the morning of Dec. 17. Massey said a report about the case on the Fox network television program "America's Most Wanted" during the weekend generated some leads, which are being checked by police.
DiPietro told investigators he last saw Ayla when he put her to bed the night before at his home in Waterville, a city of 16,000 residents about 20 miles north of the state capital, Augusta. He said she was wearing polka dot pajamas with the words "Daddy's Princess" on them and had a cast on her broken left arm.
Ayla ended up with her father after child welfare workers intervened while her mother, Trista Reynolds, checked herself into a 10-day rehabilitation program.
Reynolds, who completed the rehab, had filed court papers that she said she hoped would lead to the return of her daughter. The filing came the day before Ayla was last seen.
DiPietro has said he has "no idea what happened to Ayla or who is responsible." He said last week his family and friends would do "everything we can to assist in this investigation and get Ayla back home."

Healthy Living News
Dad’s big day is just around the corner. This year, Father's Day falls on June 17. Dads can get a bad rap when it comes to health, but here at Healthy Living we know fathers who are exceptionally healthy -- the men who taught us how to catch (and cook!) our own heart-healthy fish or how to ride a bike.
You've got a couple of weeks left to find the perfect Father's Day gift to tell dad thanks. We’ve compiled a few of our favorite ideas, meant to inspire and encourage the healthy side of your father. Click through the suggestions below, then tell us in the comments how you and your father will be celebrating.
Loading Slideshow
Brain GamesHelp the tech dad put his hours in front of the screen to good use with a gift membership to <a href="http://www.lumosity.com/" target="_hplink">Lumosity</a>. <br><br>
The site, developed by neuroscientists, is full of games, exercises and activities to give the brain a workout. A 2008 study found that playing such puzzles can <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/magazine/can-you-make-yourself-smarter.html?pagewanted=all" target="_hplink">boost intelligence and problem-solving skills</a>. The same researchers also showed that in people of an advanced age, similar training can <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19140646" target="_hplink">improve memory</a>. Gift dad a membership for a few months and grant him unlimited access to better brain power.The Perfect PillowA top-quality pillow can be a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-michael-j-breus/sleep-bedroom_b_1455850.html" target="_hplink">pricier investment</a>, but it's worth it when you consider the health effects of not getting top-quality sleep. Skimping on shut-eye can up dad's risk of heart problems, obesity and diabetes, to name a few. Help him catch better winks with the right pillow for his sleeping style with this helpful <a href="http://sleepbetter.org/home/how-to-find-your-new-favorite-pillow/" target="_hplink">how-to guide</a>. <br><br>
If dad's a snorer, an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brookstone-Anti-Snore-Pillow/dp/B002MBBZ0E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1338483720&sr=8-1" target="_hplink">anti-snore pillow</a> may be worth a try -- not to mention the ensuing silence <em>could</em> be a gift for more than one person! <br><br>
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brookstone-Anti-Snore-Pillow/dp/B002MBBZ0E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1338483720&sr=8-1" target="_hplink">Photo from Amazon.com</a></em>Grill To GoNo matter how much -- or how little -- time they like to spend in the kitchen, dads never seem to mind firing up the grill. Which is okay with us, since grilling food can cut down on fat and calories compared to other cooking methods, like frying. With a portable grill, your father can take his healthy eating on the go. We love this <a href="http://www.elementbyfuego.com/index.php/element_portable/#index.php/Summer_Special/" target="_hplink">stylish model from Element by Fuego</a>, complete with a handy shoulder strap. Or, opt for a more <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-9940-A55-Roadtrip-Party-Grill/dp/B000051TSC/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1338485531&sr=8-11" target="_hplink">budget-friendly pick from Coleman</a>. <br><br>
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-9940-A55-Roadtrip-Party-Grill/dp/B000051TSC/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1338485531&sr=8-11" target="_hplink">Photo from Amazon.com</a></em>A Lunch MakeoverEncourage dad to bring his lunch to work with an adults-only lunchbox that's decidedly not girly. We love this <a href="http://www.uncommongoods.com/product/upcycled-tent-lunch-bag" target="_hplink">handmade, recycled pick from Uncommon Goods</a>. Not only will he save money but he'll also have better control over what he eats during the day. Worried he won't know where to start? Pair a fun, dad-friendly cookbook with the tote, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cook-This-Awesome-350-Calorie-Meals/dp/1605291471/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1338484664&sr=1-1" target="_hplink">"Cook This, Not That!"</a>
<br><br>
<em><a href="http://www.uncommongoods.com/product/upcycled-tent-lunch-bag" target="_hplink">Photo from Uncommon Goods</a></em>A Garden SeatGardening and other yard work that falls to dads, like mowing the lawn, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/24/memorial-day-chores-calories_n_1543691.html#s=1018494" target="_hplink">can burn over 300 calories an hour</a>, but all that crouching and stooping can be tough on his back. Encourage him to stick with his outdoor activities with a convenient <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Picnic-Time-5-Piece-Garden-Folding/dp/B000FTGIAM/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1338484964&sr=8-3" target="_hplink">folding garden seat</a>. This model even comes with some crucial tools, if it's time to replace his. <br><br>
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Picnic-Time-5-Piece-Garden-Folding/dp/B000FTGIAM/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1338484964&sr=8-3" target="_hplink">Photo from Amazon.com</a></em>Healthy TreatsWe love the idea of a health-themed gift basket, like this <a href="http://wellbaskets.com/hefadaygiba.html" target="_hplink">heart-healthy collection</a> that includes low-fat, high-fiber treats. <br><br>
But you can just as easily make dad a healthy basket all your own. Some suggestions: Almonds, dark chocolate, gourmet olive oil, kernels for air-popped popcorn and even red wine!
<br><br>
<em>Flickr photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/goblinbox/7000844806/" target="_hplink">goblinbox</a></em>Fun GlassesFather's Day falls just before the start of summer. With the warmer temps comes a higher risk of dehydration, which can carry serious side effects, particularly as we age. Encourage dad to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/07/drinking-water-week-more-water_n_1474999.html" target="_hplink">drink his daily H2O</a> with fun glasses, like this <a href="http://www.uncommongoods.com/product/bicycle-glasses-set-of-8" target="_hplink">fitness-inspired set</a> from Uncommon Goods.
<br><br>
<em><a href="http://www.uncommongoods.com/product/bicycle-glasses-set-of-8" target="_hplink">Photo from Uncommon Goods</a>
</em>Personal Training SessionsThere's some serious science behind the idea that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/07/life-expectancy-exercise_n_1497665.html" target="_hplink">exercise just might be the fountain of youth</a>. Of course, you want dad to stick around as long as possible, but what if he's not familiar with the ins and outs of the gym? Sign him up for a few sessions with a personal trainer who can show him the ropes. Then encourage him to stick with it by planning a workout you can do together.Related Video

Uh-oh -- it's that time of year again, when we orphans have to close our eyes every time we walk by a card rack. I hadn't realized until both of my parents were gone just how hard Father's Day and Mother's Day could be. Sarah McGiven: Weekend Shopping: Father's Day Gift Guide
Firstly, DON'T PANIC - Father's Day is NEXT Sunday (17th June), in the UK. This is just a heads up with a few ideas all available to buy online for anyone who doesn't want to run the rain gauntlet or waste any lesser spotted sunny spells trekking round the shops looking for presents.	Matt Chambers: Buying Whisky For Father's Day?
Whisky is a popular Father's Day gift, but buying it can be daunting experience if you don't know about whisky, especially if you buy it rarely. The big question is, which of the vast array of bottles on the shelf is the right one to choose? Here is our quick guide to help you buy the correct present for your dad.	Jeff Levick: A Father's Day Gift: Celebrating Working Dads
On this Father's Day, while we still have a long way to go to catch up with our working mother counterparts, I'd like to celebrate the working fathers for their hard work and for trying to do it all.	Bradley Burston: What I Wanted for Father's Day, and What I Got
What to ask for this Father's Day, in this bludgeon of a Holy Land? One night in which the only thing shattered and abruptly displaced is the bitter air of hatred we have all somehow learned to breathe.	David Wild: So Long Dad: A Playlist for This Father's Day
This will be my first Father's Day since losing my dad. I woke up this morning and sensed a new and profound void. So here's the playlist I put together in order to help fill that void a little. Steven Petrow: Queeries: How to Celebrate Father's Day When Your Kid Has Two Moms
When push comes to shove, it doesn't really matter whether it's a single mom raising her child alone, a mother who's been widowed or a pair of lesbian moms: a family is a family, with or without a dad around.	Around the Web:

The possibility that the second New Jersey to New York rail tunnel could be canceled is a distressing sign of our current financial weakness and our unwillingness to invest in the future. New Jersey Governor Christie is correct when he argues the state cannot spend money it doesn't have, but he should be doing a better job of understanding the long term impact of his short-sighted decision. Anyone trying to get around in New Jersey knows that traffic is getting worse every year. While most of the traffic is not coming from people trying to get into Manhattan, some of it is. While it is not practical for people living in New Jersey's suburbs to get around Jersey on mass transit, people traveling to and from the City have every reason to avoid the drive. Every driver removed from the state's roadways reduces traffic and increases New Jersey's economic viability. How much would Jersey's drivers pay for a little less traffic? Perhaps Governor Christie should try to find out. However, reduced local traffic is only one benefit of the tunnel. Increased real estate values are another major benefit of the tunnel project.
In the long term, New Jersey's economic well-being depends on both continued close connections with New York City as well as reduced travel time within the state. The train tunnel project contributes to achieving both goals. The economic benefits of improved mass transit connections to New York are obvious. In fact, all the Governor needs to do is to look at the impact of the Midtown Direct train line (which opened in the 1990's) on real estate values in the towns along the route. The Regional Plan Association did just that, and then projected the economic benefits of the rail tunnel for New Jersey property owners. In their report, The ARC Effect, the Regional Plan Association noted that three New Jersey transit projects in the 1990s "boosted home values by $11 billion. This represents $250 million a year in new property tax revenue for municipalities." According to Regional Plan Association Senior Planner Juliette Michaelson, the train tunnel: ...could increase home values within two miles of train stations by a cumulative $18 billion. For stations within 70 minutes of Midtown, this translates to an average of $19,000 per home. The effect is most pronounced nearest the stations, with an estimated increase of $29,000. Higher home values means higher tax bases, and higher tax bases reduce the pressure to raise property tax rates.
I assume the Governor and his staff have read these projections and either don't believe them, think we are too poor to invest in the future, or are trying to get someone else to assume the risk of cost over-runs. I hope this is simply a bargaining ploy, because if it's not, it is a mistake of almost tragic proportions. Since New York City will grow with or without New Jersey, the likely impact will be to drive real estate pressure elsewhere. The property values that would go up in New Jersey will shift to the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Westchester, Nassau, and elsewhere in Manhattan--all places with decent rail connections to New York's core business districts. With the opening of Grand Central Terminal to the Long Island Railroad, Long Island will attract renewed development. Even Staten Island, with its free ferry, will do better than New Jersey in the competition for new residents. Since the costs of the tunnel overruns can be financed over time, and the economic benefits of the tunnel will be seen in the future, it might make sense to ask those benefiting from the tunnel to do a little more to finance it. A tax on gasoline, a property tax surcharge and a surcharge on train tickets could help finance the tunnel. You could even delay levying these new taxes until the tunnel opened and the benefits of the state's investments began. Of course, as Governor Christie has learned, in this Tea Party driven political environment, the surest way to gain attention and support is to sip a cup of no tax tea. I know he thinks his state is over-taxed, but does he also oppose investment and building the infrastructure needed for future prosperity? American government has built the infrastructure needed for economic development throughout our history. Security, safety, justice and shared infrastructure are fundamental and irreducible functions of government. When wealthy conservatives attack infrastructure investment, they are attacking the basis of their own wealth. Imagine our modern economy without ports, airports, roads, bridges, satellite communications and the internet. Imagine our history as a nation without land grant colleges, the first cross- continental railroads, the Erie Canal, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Colorado River project and our national parks. The idea that the private sector can thrive without public investment is a hoax and dangerously misleading. Private enterprise is the best way to generate wealth, but the conditions needed to ensure a thriving private sector include an efficient, effective and forward looking public sector: one that is capable of investing in projects like the new train tunnel from New Jersey to Manhattan. It would be nice to have that type of government.
