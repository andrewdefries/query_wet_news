Former Obama adviser Peter Orszag's inaugural guest column in Monday's New York Times illustrates the extent to which the White House has been able to successfully keep hidden even basic internal disagreements over political strategy and economic policy. On the question of extending the Bush tax cuts for everyone except the rich, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget touts what he called a "compromise" approach.
"[E]xtend the tax cuts for two years and then end them altogether," he writes. "Ideally only the middle-class tax cuts would be continued for now. Getting a deal in Congress, though, may require keeping the high-income tax cuts, too. And that would still be worth it."
On the surface, Orszag's proposal seems to be just an incremental give-away. Because the Senate may not pass only a partial extension of the tax cuts, better to cut a temporary deal, provide some continued relief, and firmly commit to letting those cuts expire in more prosperous times. But within the White House, many believe that to make even a small compromise on the Bush tax cuts (whether on political or economic grounds) is to give the store away. Last month, for instance, the Vice President's chief economic adviser Jared Bernstein sat down with the Huffington Post for an off-the-record discussion on a host of economic matters. The one thing that he and his office allowed to be printed was a relatively uncompromising take on why a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy simply won't work. "There are many good reasons not to extend the high-end parts of the Bush tax cuts having to do with the fear that a temporary extension could be made permanent," Bernstein said. "What you are talking about -- a $30 to 40 billion range in terms of adding to the deficit by extending the high end -- could easily become $700 billion over a ten-year budget window."
It was also fairly noteworthy that just hours after Orszag's New York Times column went live, the White House formally pushed back on the compromise suggestion.
"The president has been clear about his support for extending tax cuts for the middle class and about ending the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, which would cost 700 billion over ten years to extend at a time when we are dealing with a fiscal crisis and the independent CBO has listed as the least effective form of growing the economy," said spokesperson Jen Psaki. White House aides have been relatively mum about whether Orszag privately argued for a temporary extension of Bush tax cuts for the wealthy while still in the administration. But the fact that, immediately upon leaving, he made this argument suggests as much. Increasingly, there have been whispers within the White House and among the cadre of economic advisers that deal closely with the administration that Orszag was a voice at odds with his colleagues. One Democratic figure who requested anonymity to talk about his personal dealings with White House officials said it was "totally outrageous" that Orszag had earned the reputation of being a progressive voice on economic matters -- a perception largely earned by his fierce advocacy for health care reform as a means of changing the country's fiscal trajectory. "He never was," the official said. "I find it astonishing that a deficit hawks like Peter, who was opposed to further stimulus and initiated the freeze on domestic spending, now he worries about the jobs impact of raising taxes on the high end," said Lawrence Mishel, President of the progressive-leaning Economic Policy Institute. "Give me a break. Sorry, I can't see endorsing the notion that having the rich pay more taxes is a harsh thing for the recovery, especially coming from someone I feel has been relatively indifferent to the need for further stimulus." Back when Christina Romer resigned from her post as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, meanwhile, the conventional wisdom was that her arguments with chief adviser Larry Summers were to blame. But in a telling bit of pushback that wasn't disputed within administration circles, an economic adviser who worked closely with Romer, Summers and Orszag said that the "balance of power on the economic team" actually "changed with Peter Orszag's departure. "He was the main antagonist of Summers' and Romer's in advocating a stop to measures supporting discretionary spending," the adviser said, requesting anonymity. "Summers and Romer were actually closely aligned on macro-economic policy."
There is in the end little remarkable about the fact that these differences on economic policy took 18 months to begin making their way into public. If anything, Obama's operations are known for their tight message control. But, as with Romer's departure speech, in which she advocated for a strong commitment to government spending, it will be fascinating to watch how the White House -- already under siege due to the economic policies it's chosen -- handles the second guessing that comes from former aides.

-- A lesbian actress who starred in the Showtime cable show "The L Word" says she was escorted off a Southwest Airlines flight for kissing a woman, while the airline says it was excessive and drew customer complaints.
Leisha Hailey took to Twitter on Monday to call for a boycott of the carrier after a flight attendant told them other passengers had complained after witnessing the affection.
Her first tweet said: "I have been discriminated against." She later added, "Since when is showing affection to someone you love illegal?"
Southwest Airlines Co. responded on its website with a four-sentence response.
"Initial reports indicate that we received several passenger complaints characterizing the behavior as excessive. Our crew, responsible for the comfort of all Customers on board, approached the passengers based solely on behavior and not gender," it said.
A discussion followed on the flight, and the airline said it "escalated to a level that was better resolved on the ground."
The actress and her unidentified girlfriend were on a flight from Baltimore to St. Louis. The kissing occurred in the air and a discussion followed when the plane landed, but details of how the couple was escorted off the flight were not included in the Southwest statement.
Hailey said the encounter between the couple and a flight attendant was recorded. It's not immediately clear who made it.
A message seeking comment from Halley's spokeswoman, Libby Coffey, was not immediately returned.
Hailey was a musician before joining the cast of the Showtime drama featuring the lives of lesbian friends and lovers living in Los Angeles. She played the character Alice Pieszecki. The show is currently not aired.
Southwest's website says it is the official airline of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.
Herndon Graddick, senior director of programs at GLAAD, said in an email that "GLAAD contacted Southwest to call for additional actions beyond tonight's statement that ensure all customers feel comfortable and welcomed while traveling."
Earlier this month, the Dallas-based airline kicked off Green Day's lead man Billie Joe Armstrong for wearing his pants too low. The Grammy winner was escorted off a plane after failing to follow a flight attendant's directive to pull the pants up.
Southwest also removed director Kevin Smith from a flight last year because he didn't fit properly in a single seat. His first tweet read, "Dear (at)SouthwestAir I know I'm fat, but was (the) captain (...) really justified in throwing me off a flight for which I was already seated?"
Hailey is preparing to launch a 21-city tour to promote breast cancer awareness.

Some might say, "Grab your bag and head to another airline." And indeed, Leisha and Cam have taken that stance. I say, "Southwest, be 'plane smart' and take this opportunity to further educate your employees." Irene Monroe: Flying While Gay
I would like to know how many heterosexual couples have been or would be thrown off Southwest Airlines for kissing. Would it even be an issue? Hailey's peck on the lips should be a non-issue; the elephant that weighed Flight 2274 down was homophobia. Filed by Sasha Bronner

Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) insisted on Saturday night that as president she would see to it that every undocumented immigrant in the country be deported. Speaking at a Fox News forum hosted by Mike Huckabee, the Minnesota Republican was fairly broad in describing how she would round up and ship out of the country the 10 to 12 million people living here without documentation. But the implication was that she would empower government agents to do the deed. "[I]t would be enforcement: Enforcement both at the border but also by the [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents. Right now the ICE agents -- those are the agents in the interior of the country who are tasked with enforcing the law -- they are not enforcing them and we also have sanctuary cities now where they don't enforce the laws on deportation. I think that what we simply need to do is to start enforcing the laws which we are not doing and begin the process of deportation," she said.
Prior to explaining how she would execute her deportation policy, Bachmann argued that undocumented citizens cost the country $113 billion every year. Asked by The Huffington Post where the congresswoman got her statistics, a Bachmann spokesperson pointed to a press release from the Federation for American Immigration Reform. In coming out for 100 percent deportation, Bachmann is deliberately contrasting herself with Newt Gingrich, who argued that it would be impractical if not inhumane to rip families and communities apart. A recent Pew study showed that roughly two-thirds of all the undocumented immigrants in the United States have been in the country for 10 or more years. "I agree, this is the thorniest and most difficult issue in dealing with illegal immigration," conceded Bachmann. "What about deportation? I believe we should uphold the laws of the land, which does include deportation. How do we pay for it? The American taxpayer."

A little grey squirrel, dubbed "Violet," who fell from her nest last week has been outfitted with a cast that fits just right.
According to the Solent News & Photo Agency, Violet fell to ground when a couple unknowingly trimmed the tree branch that was holding her nest. Spotting the baby and realizing she was now separated from her mother, the couple called up animal rescue workers at the Wildlife Aid Foundation, who bandaged up the squirrel with a small cast that was -- you guessed it -- violet.
Foundation workers have since been feeding her a special milk formula while they nurse her back to health, MSNBC reports.
"Violet is a little fighter and is coping very well - I’m really hopeful she will be fine," Lucy Kells, hospital manager at the Wildlife Aid Foundation, told the Daily Mail. "We hope we can release her back into the wild in about 16 to 20 weeks' time."
