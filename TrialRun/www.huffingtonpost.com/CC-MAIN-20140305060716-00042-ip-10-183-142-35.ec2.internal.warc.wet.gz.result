Mumford & Son's "Babel" took home the trophy for Album of the Year at Sunday's 55th Annual Grammy Awards, besting Frank Ocean's "channel ORANGE," the Black Keys' "El Camino", fun.'s "Some Nights," and Jack White's "Blunderbuss." In pre-awards buzz, "Babel" was somewhat of a favorite, in part because the album strikes the right balance of commercial success and critical appeal. The album sold 600,000 copies in its first week, the year's best until Taylor Swift's "Red" debuted with a million-unit week.
It's worth noting that none of this year's Album of the Year nominees were female, a seeming omission that has not gone unnoticed. The Recording Academy votes on nominees and winners. Dubbed Music's Biggest Night, the awards broadcast is intended to be the gold standard for the industry. While the Academy has often been chided for its peculiar way of including and excluding certain artists and genres, "Grammy-winner" remains music's biggest plaudit. According to the Academy, 39.9 million viewers watched last year's show -- the largest TV audience for the event since 1984. An average of 160,341 tweets per minute were posted during the broadcast.
Last year's Grammy winners included Kanye West and Adele, who combined for ten awards.

Benjamin Franklin, who used his many talents to become a wealthy man, famously said that the only things certain in life are death and taxes. But if you're a corporate CEO in America today, even they can be put on the backburner -- death held at bay by the best medical care money can buy and the latest in surgical and life extension techniques, taxes conveniently shunted aside courtesy of loopholes, overseas investment and governments that conveniently look the other way.
In a story headlined, "For Big Companies, Life Is Good," the Wall Street Journal reports that big American companies have emerged from the deepest recession since World War II more profitable than ever: flush with cash, less burdened by debt, and with a greater share of the country's income. But, the paper notes, "Many of the 1.1 million jobs the big companies added since 2007 were outside the U.S. So, too, was much of the $1.2 trillion added to corporate treasuries."
To add to this embarrassment of riches, the consumer group Citizens for Tax Justice reports that more than two dozen major corporations -- including GE, Boeing, Mattel and Verizon -- paid no federal taxes between 2008 and 2011. They got a corporate tax break that was broadly supported by Republicans and Democrats alike.
Corporate taxes today are at a 40-year-low -- even as the executive suites at big corporations have become throne rooms where the crown jewels wind up in the personal vault of the CEO.
Then look at this report in the New York Times: Last year, among the 100 best-paid CEOs, the median income was more than $14 million, compared with the average annual American salary of $45,230. Combined, this happy hundred executives pulled down more than two billion dollars.
What's more, according to the Times "... these CEOs might seem like pikers. Top hedge fund managers collectively earned $14.4 billion last year." No wonder some of them are fighting to kill a provision in the recent Dodd-Frank reform law that would require disclosing the ratio of CEO pay to the median pay of their employees. One never wishes to upset the help, you know. It can lead to unrest.
That's Wall Street -- the metaphorical bestiary of the financial universe. But there's nothing metaphorical about the earnings of hedge fund tigers, private equity lions, and the top dogs at those big banks that were bailed out by tax dollars after they helped chase our economy off a cliff.
So what do these big moneyed nabobs have to complain about? Why are they whining about reform? And why are they funneling cash to super PACs aimed at bringing down Barack Obama, who many of them supported four years ago?
Because, writes Alec MacGillis in The New Republic -- the president wants to raise their taxes. That's right -- while ordinary Americans are taxed at a top rate of 35 percent on their income, Congress allows hedge fund and private equity tycoons to pay only pay 15 percent of their compensation. The president wants them to pay more; still at a rate below what you might pay, and for that he's being accused of - hold onto your combat helmets -- "class warfare." One Wall Street Midas, once an Obama fan, now his foe, told MacGillis that by making the rich a primary target, Obama is "[expletive deleted] on people who are successful."
And can you believe this? Two years ago, when President Obama first tried to close that gaping loophole in our tax code, Stephen Schwarzman, who runs the Blackstone Group, the world's largest private equity fund, compared the president's action to Hitler's invasion of Poland.
That's the same Stephen Schwarzman whose agents in 2006 launched a predatory raid on a travel company in Colorado. His fund bought it, laid off 841 employees, and recouped its entire investment in just seven months -- one of the quickest returns on capital ever for such a deal.
To celebrate his 60th birthday Mr. Schwarzman rented the Park Avenue Armory here in New York at a cost of $3 million, including a gospel choir led by Patti LaBelle that serenaded him with "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands." Does he ever -- his net worth is estimated at nearly $5 billion. Last year alone Schwarzman took home over $213 million in pay and dividends, a third more than 2010. Now he's fundraising for Mitt Romney, who, like him, made his bundle on leveraged buyouts that left many American workers up the creek.
To add insult to injury, average taxpayers even help subsidize the private jet travel of the rich. On the Times' DealBook blog, mergers and acquisitions expert Steven Davidoff writes, "If an outside security consultant determines that executives need a private jet and other services for their safety, the Internal Revenue Service cuts corporate chieftains a break. In such cases, the chief executive will pay a reduced tax bill or sometimes no tax at all."
Are the CEOs really in danger? No, says Davidoff, "It's a common corporate tax trick."
Talk about your friendly skies. No wonder the people with money and influence don't feel connected to the rest of the population. It's as if they live in a foreign country at the top of the world, like their own private Switzerland, at heights so rarefied they can't imagine life down below.

My husband and I have the same interaction most mornings.
"Hey, honey, do you know where I put my list of things to do today?"
"I think you put it by the telephone."
"No, it's not there, but here's your cell phone charger."
"Excellent! I've been missing that for days. Did you find the thing you were looking for?"
"What thing?"
My short-term memory has taken some unapproved vacation time. As its boss, I am not pleased. However, I don't blame it for leaving. Maybe it's concluded there are some things going on during my menopausal 50s that should not be remembered. The decision could have been made the day I walked into my office, used the restroom, and then wandered out to buy mascara, forgetting that I was there to send an important document to my CPA. Or the day I was trying to book an airline ticket for my daughter and could not, for the life of me, remember her birthday. I even heard a "good gawd" from the agent as I stumbled over the date. Yes, I was there when she was born. Yes, it was painful. No, I can't remember the date.
My short-term memory may have shut off the day I put mascara on only one eye and looked all Clockwork Orange for the rest of the day. Or perhaps it was the day that I yelled "Are you effin' kidding me?" and burst into tears in the grocery store aisle because my favorite diet cookies had been replaced with their crappy generic version. I think most of us are finding our memories smashed under the anvil of so much information. I turn on my computer at 9 a.m. and am suddenly inundated with information, including great blogs from intelligent people that are blended with threats of nuclear war and suggestions concerning the right fertilizer for my yard. Oh, yeah, and Jessica Simpson is showing a baby bump and more district attorneys have been shot and Kim Kardashian got bangs and Margaret Thatcher died.
Every story seems to have equal value, so I'm suddenly tweeting about everything from shit to bangs to the possible big North Korean bang. Within an hour, I barely know where I am.
In light of this avalanche of information, I know why my short-term memory is in the islands. I also understand the new need for lists these days. Every blogger knows that viewership goes up if you distill your facts into a list.
In case you weren't aware, Margaret Thatcher did pass away. Unfortunately, a lot of people probably read more about Shania Twain's boots at the ACM Awards rather than the passing of one of the most powerful female leaders in our lifetime. Maybe if the story on Thatcher had been written like this:
"Margaret Thatcher was:
1.	The only female Prime Minister in the history of Britain.
2.	Very controversial, mostly because she was the only female Prime Minister in the history of Britain.
3.	The daughter of a grocer, who graduated from Oxford University as a research chemist.
4.	Married to a wealthy businessman, which doesn't seem relevant but is always mentioned. 5.	A strong leader, but was not wearing thigh-high boots or donning a new hair-do which means you might have missed it."
See? Lists simplify information. The problem is that lists also over-simplify things by removing the guts of an issue. Want to know if your company is efficient? There's a checklist for that. Want to know how to satisfy your spouse? There are multiple lists for that. Want to know if your neighbor is a sociopath? There's a checklist for that, too. By the way, according to that checklist one out of 25 ordinary Americans are sociopaths. Look around, you could be having lunch with Hannibal Lecter.
Checklists are easy and often misleading but, hey, in a ridiculously brain-busy world I'll go with whatever works.
I even looked back 40 years to check out Jerry Lucas's The Memory Book, published in 1974. I told you my short-term memory was shot. Jerry Lucas was a professional basketball player and genius, much like Bobby Knight. His passion was helping people learn how to remember things through association of objects. Here's an example:
Need to buy a lamp today?
Also need to buy typewriter paper? (Hey, it was 1974)
Imagine yourself putting a lighted lamp into your typewriter.
Need to also pick up a suit?
Imagine wearing typing paper instead of a suit.
I tried this approach the other day. I needed to take the dog to daycare, pick up some medicine at the drugstore, write three blogs and get groceries. So, I:
Imagined walking into doggie daycare while dressed as a pill bottle.
Imagined three blogs written on the prescription label.
Imagined blogs written about getting groceries.
Thanks to this genius approach, I walked into the doggie daycare and asked about my prescription, which totally confused the owner. I then wrote the shortest blogs in the history of the world about getting groceries, but then forgot to actually go to the grocery store. I'm still waiting for my prescription to be filled by Hanover Your Pets. Association doesn't work for me. I need my lists.
Here are 5 reasons why I'm glad my short-term memory is on vacation:
1.	People no longer expect me to remember their birthdays now that I've forgotten my own children's birthdays. 2. When I forget to put on make-up, I get sent home from work because everyone says I "look like death."
3.	When kids ask for money, I really do forget to send it to them. They thank me for my tough love. I have no idea what they're talking about.
4.	When that well-meaning young man tells me that I remind him of his grandmother, I can slap the hell out of him and then forget about it.
5.	I've forgotten my fifth point.
But at least I have my list.

The Alzheimer's Prevention Cookbook<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Alzheimers-Prevention-Cookbook-Recipes/dp/1607742470">The Alzheimer's Prevention Cookbook</a> by Dr. Marwan Sabbagh and Beau MacMillan. Published by Ten Speed Press. (The following slides were reprinted with permission from The Alzheimer’s Prevention Cookbook: Recipes to Boost Brain Health by Dr. Marwan Sabbagh and Beau MacMillan, copyright © 2012. Published by Ten Speed Press, an imprint of the Crown Publishing Group)Sweet Peach SmoothieThe key to this recipe is using a ripe, in-season peach. It’s always good to get to know the produce guys at your local grocery store because they will let you know when peaches are in their prime. Peaches contain numerous nutrients that are good for your body, including niacin, thiamin, potassium, and calcium. They are also high in beta-carotene, which promotes healthy hearts and eyes. The darker the peach’s color, the more vitamin A it has in its pulp. Peaches may also help in maintaining healthy urinary and digestive functions. There’s some evidence that flaxseed oil may help reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and even diabetes. Sweet Peach SmoothieMAKES ABOUT 3 CUPS
11/2 cups apple juice
1 ripe peach, peeled, pitted, and chopped (about 3/4 cup)
3/4 ripe banana, peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon vanilla yogurt
6 ice cubes
2 teaspoons honey
2 teaspoons flaxseed oil
Combine the apple juice, peach, banana, yogurt, and ice in a blender and puree until smooth. Add the honey
and flaxseed oil and puree briefly to incorporate.
Pour into glasses and serve right away.Breakfast Fried Rice with Scrambled EggsThink outside the (cereal) box: fried rice is a great way to fuel up with carbs in the morning. With brown rice, lots of fresh vegetables, and a minimal amount of fat, this recipe is a healthy take on fried rice and is high in vitamin B6. <em>Lop chong</em> is a dried, cooked Chinese sausage with a slightly sweet and smoky flavor; it will require a trip to the Asian grocery store, but you can choose to leave it out. Breakfast Fried Rice with Scrambled EggsMAKES 4 SERVINGS
Fried Rice
2 tablespoons chopped lop chong (Chinese sausage; optional)
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
1 tablespoon peeled, chopped fresh ginger
1 green onion, white and green parts, chopped
2 tablespoons diced red onion
1 or 2 leaves baby bok choy, thinly sliced
1/4 cup shredded red cabbage
5 sugar snap peas, cut into thin strip on the diagonal
2 cups cooked and cooled brown rice
4 tablespoons soy sauce
4 tablespoons mirin
Eggs and Garnishes
2 large eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
2 tablespoons toasted cashews, chopped
1 green onion, white and green parts, sliced thin on the diagonal
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
To make the fried rice, in a large wok or large skillet over high heat, fry the lop chong until rendered, less than a minute. Transfer the lop chong to a paper towel–lined plate and discard the fat.
Set the wok over high heat and heat until very hot. Add the oil to the wok. Add the garlic, ginger, chopped green onion, red onion, bok choy, cabbage, and snap peas. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, or until the vegetables have softened and you can smell the ginger.
Add the rice and continue to cook, stirring, until everything is coated, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the soy sauce and mirin and toss well. Remove the wok from the heat.
To cook the eggs, heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Spray the pan with nonstick cooking spray, and then pour in the beaten eggs. Cook, gently stirring the eggs, until scrambled but still moist.
Transfer fried rice to a serving bowl and top with the scrambled eggs. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds, toasted cashews, and diagonally cut green onion and serve right away.Ahi Tuna on Rye with Spinach Pesto YogurtThis is not your average tuna sandwich. For one thing, it’s more like tuna tartare on bread. For another, it’s a very brain-healthy meal. Spinach Pesto Yogurt, not mayonnaise, holds the tuna mixture together, which keeps the amount of saturated fat to a minimum. Tuna is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, the pistachios provide vitamin E, and the raisins are a good source of polyphenol antioxidants. Because the tuna is not cooked in this recipe, be sure to purchase sashimi-grade tuna; ask the fishmonger if you aren’t sure about the quality of the tuna on offer at the seafood counter.
Ahi Tuna on Rye with Spinach Pesto YogurtMAKES 2 SANDWICHES
8 ounces sashimi-grade ahi tuna, diced small
2 tablespoons Spinach Pesto Yogurt 2 tablespoons golden raisins
1/4 cup shelled unsalted roasted pistachios, chopped
Juice of 1/2 lemon
4 slices rye bread, toasted
1/2 cup alfalfa sprouts
1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
Spinach Pesto Yogurt
Makes about 3 cups
2 cups loosely packed baby spinach
1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup pine nuts
2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1 clove garlic, peeled
Juice of 1 lemon
Pinch of salt
Pinch of freshly ground black pepper
1 cup low-fat or nonfat plain yogurt
In a medium bowl, combine the tuna, Spinach Pesto Yogurt, raisins, pistachios, and lemon juice, and mix well.
Lay out two of the bread slices on a work surface and divide the tuna mixture evenly among them. Put the alfalfa sprouts into a small bowl, drizzle with the olive oil, and toss to combine. Top each portion of tuna with half of the alfalfa sprouts and top with the remaining slices of bread. Cut each sandwich in half and serve right
away.
Combine the spinach, olive oil, pine nuts, cheese, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a blender and puree until well blended. Pour the mixture into a bowl, add the yogurt, and whisk until incorporated. Serve slightly chilled. The mixture will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days.Striped Bass with Golden Tomato and Sweet Pepper StewStriped Bass with Golden Tomato and Sweet Pepper StewMAKES 4 SERVINGS
Tomato and Sweet Pepper Stew
3 tablespoons olive oil 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
1 small shallot, finely chopped
1 fennel bulb, diced large
2 yellow bell peppers, seeded and diced large 3 yellow tomatoes, cored and diced large
Pinch of saffron threads
2 tablespoons Pernod or other anise liqueur, such as ouzo or anisette
1 cup white wine
2 cups Brain-Boosting Broth Salt and freshly ground black pepper
Fish 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 (6-ounce) skin-on striped bass fillets
Salt and freshly ground pepper
11/2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, for garnish
Preheat the oven to 350°F. To make the stew, in a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the garlic, shallot, fennel, and bell peppers and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and saffron and continue to cook until the tomatoes soften slightly, about 2 minutes. Pour in the Pernod, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring, until almost evaporated. Add the white wine, bring to a simmer, and cook until the liquid is reduced by about half, about 5 minutes. Pour in the broth, season with salt and pepper, and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes to bring the flavors together. While the stew is simmering, cook the fish. In a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Score the fish fillets with a knife and season them with salt and pepper. Add the fish fillets to the skillet skin side down and cook until the skin is golden brown and crisp, about 3 minutes. Slide the skillet into the oven and cook until the fish skin is opaque and flaky, about 5 minutes. Divide the stew among four plates and place a fish fillet on top. Sprinkle with parsley and serve right away.
Brain-Boosting Broth
Makes 2 quarts 8 quarts water 3 carrots, coarsely chopped 2 white onions, coarsely chopped
2 celery stalks, coarsely chopped
2 bulbs fennel, coarsely chopped
1 parsnip, coarsely chopped
12 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 cup fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
Stems from 1/2 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley 1 bunch green onions, green and white parts 1 stalk fresh lemongrass, cut in half lengthwise 1 tablespoon salt 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
2 cloves
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 bay leaf
Combine all of the ingredients in a large stockpot and bring to a boil over high heat. Turn down the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, uncovered, for 2 hours. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve. Use immediately, refrigerate for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 1 month. Spaghetti Squash with Caramelized Onion and TomatoSpaghetti squash is an often-overlooked vegetable. But it’s a very powerful ingredient from a brain-health perspective: it’s low in saturated fat, very low in cholesterol, and a good source of niacin, vitamin B6, and pantothenic acid--plus spaghetti squash is a very good source of vitamin C. In this recipe, strands of baked spaghetti squash are the backdrop for sweet caramelized onions that contrast against salty, savory Parmesan cheese. This dish will appeal to adults and kids alike, and it’s a great way to get pasta lovers to eat more vegetables.Spaghetti Squash with Caramelized Onion and TomatoMAKES 4 SERVINGS
Olive oil
1/2 spaghetti squash (about 2 pounds), seeded
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
Curry Salt 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
1/3 cup chopped fresh chives
1 ripe tomato, cored, seeded, and diced
Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Drizzle a rimmed baking sheet and the flesh of the squash with a little olive oil. Set the squash half cut side down on the baking sheet. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of water over the squash and bake, uncovered, until a fork inserted into the thickest part of the flesh meets no resistance, 30 to 45 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
Using a fork, scrape the squash from the skin into a medium bowl; the flesh will separate into spaghetti-like strands (you should have about 21/2 cups). Return the skillet with the onion to medium heat and add the squash. Cook, tossing gently, just until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Season to taste with Curry Salt; go easy because the cheese will add salt, too. Toss in the cheese and chives and transfer to a serving bowl. Sprinkle with the tomatoes and cilantro and serve right away. Curry Salt
Makes about 1/2 cup
1/2 cup fleur de sel
4 teaspoons curry powder
Mix the salt and curry powder until well combined. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place (the flavor of the salt gets better with age). This recipe will not go bad over time. Curried Quinoa with Green Onions and BasilCurried Quinoa with Green Onions and BasilMAKES 4 SERVINGS
11/2 cups Brain-Boosting Broth 3/4 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
5 to 7 green onions, white and green parts, chopped
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted
1/4 cup dried cherries, chopped Pinch of salt
Pinch of freshly ground black pepper
Juice of 1 lemon
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring the broth to a boil. Add the quinoa, curry powder, and ginger. Turn down the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer the quinoa to a rimmed baking sheet, distribute in an even layer, and let cool to room temperature. When cooled, put the quinoa into a medium bowl and add the green onions, basil, almonds, and cherries. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper and toss to combine. Drizzle with the lemon juice and olive oil and toss again. Serve at room temperature or lightly chilled. Brain-Boosting Broth

Think the election season ended on Nov. 6, 2012? Think again.
The shadowy super PACs and front groups that polluted the airwaves with political ads last year are already raising millions from corporations and billionaires to batter television viewers with a new wave of ads. Earlier this week, Karl Rove's super PAC American Crossroads attacked actress and political activist Ashley Judd, who is contemplating a Senate run in Kentucky. And former Obama campaign hands are lining up dark-money donors to support a public relations push for implementation of health care reforms.
The thought of having to endure another round of shady and dishonest political ads might make you queasy. But relief could be closer than you think. A long-dormant rule within the 1996 Telecommunications Act gives the Federal Communications Commission the authority to mandate disclosure of the funders behind political ads. According to the rule, political ads must "fully and fairly disclose the true identity of the person or persons, or corporation, committee, association or other unincorporated group, or other entity" paying for them.
In 2011, communications law expert Andrew Schwartzman petitioned the FCC to enforce this disclosure requirement. As the disclosure rule is on the books, the FCC already has the authority to act, argued Schwartzman, who now serves as a legal adviser to Free Press. In a Nation op-ed on Thursday, Former FCC Commissioner Michael Copps added petrol to the fire. Copps wrote that all the agency needs is a modest update of the rules. "Using the normal FCC notice-and-comment process," Copps wrote, "this needn't take longer than 90 days." But the FCC has ignored Schwartzman's petition and Copps' call for action. For many Washington insiders, toxic ads are just part of the political landscape. They're the engine that powers an influence industry that has enriched legions of political consultants and media buyers -- to the tune of more than $3 billion in political ad buys in 2012 alone.
The will to confront campaign finance issues, expose the dark money behind political ads and enforce the rules won't come from inside D.C. but from people like you and me. The type of disclosure Schwartzman and Copps call for would require identification of ads' principal funders within the actual ads. For example, it would let viewers know that an ad from a group that calls itself Concerned Taxpayers of America is merely the creation of two multi-millionaires -- the owner of a Maryland concrete company and a New York hedge-fund manager. While such a requirement may not solve our nation's crippling campaign finance problems, that kind of transparency would force many of the worst actors under the lights. And that could give many Americans the information they need to decide whether a political message is true, and the messenger credible.
The FCC hasn't enforced this rule in nearly 20 years. It's time for the agency to act.
