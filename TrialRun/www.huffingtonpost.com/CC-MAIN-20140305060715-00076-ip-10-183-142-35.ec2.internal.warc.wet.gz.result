Richard Dawkins has established himself as his generation's finest author on the human sciences and (in many opinions) the most effective popular science writer in the world. But he's turned himself into a clown, and damaged his reputation, by supporting the grotesque scheme to have Pope Benedict XVI arrested for "crimes against humanity" when he visits Britain in September.

Bill Chameides: Dawkins at Duke: Just the Facts, Ma'am
At times, with its mention of Web sites and the suggestion that people organize and send money, Richard Dawkins' lecture on Sunday had the feel of a political rally. Most of the time, however, it was pretty glorious science. Karl Giberson, Ph.D: Sir John Polkinghorne and Not Being a Scientific Simpleton
Contemporary science and Christian faith co-exist peacefully in Polkinghorne's worldview. Neither science nor religion has to be distorted to get all the ideas into the same head	Michael Ruse: Is Darwinism a Religion?
Is evolution, Darwinian evolution in particular, a religion? To sound like the philosopher that I am, it all depends on what you mean by "religion." Steven and Michael Meloan: The Trouble with Tribalism
New Atheist authors like Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins have declared that religion is the root of most global conflict. But tribalism is the true underlying factor behind these conflicts.	Paul Pardi: What's So New About the New Atheism?
The general consensus on the part of professional philosophers on all sides of the question is that the popular arguments being made by new atheists are not all that new.	Rabbi David Wolpe: The Purpose of the Universe
Is it not arrogant to imagine that something as puny as a human being can have a purpose, but to assert that something as grand as the universe cannot?	Derek Beres: Why Arresting the Pope Is a Great Idea
Leave it to Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, the totems of the British Atheist movement, to once again point out common sense, noting that the Pope's political sidestep is not recognized by the UN.	Michael Ruse: The Catholic Church: Why Richard Dawkins Was Right and I Was Wrong
The Catholic Church shows no concern whatsoever for its victims of abuse, only fear of the story getting out. It is corrupt and should be eradicated.	Bishop Pierre Whalon: Why I Am Not An Atheist
It is unreasonable to look for scientific evidence of God's existence. Whether there is or is not a creator who subsists completely outside of the universe cannot be proven or disproven.	Filed by Clay Chiles

DC News
Just weeks after it reopened, the Lincoln Memorial's Reflecting Pool has attracted algae growth.
WASHINGTON -- Despite the National Park Service's best efforts, Lincoln Memorial's newly reconstructed Reflecting Pool has filled with green algae. WTOP-FM reported on the problem last week, noting that the NPS was "boosting the amount of ozone added in the filtration stage, and have already seen the water quality improve." The reflecting pool underwent a $34 million reconstruction that concluded in August, which included building a new foundation in addition to a filtration and drainage system that circulates water to and from the Potomac River. As The Washington Post reported Tuesday:[B]ecause the pool is a smaller and shallower water source, the algae cells bloom more easily there.
"This is a direct consequence of the fact that this is a green project," [NPS spokeswoman Carol] Johnson said. "The conditions are pretty good for algae, once it gets in there."
There are no water-quality, health or safety concerns because of the buildup of algae, and the pumping and circulation system is working properly, Johnson said.
Once ozone levels in the pool are fine-tuned, the NPS plans a one-time removal of the algae, much of which has died and sunk to the bottom of the pool, the Post reported.

September 1, 2012 -- Ian writes: "This was a planned outing to go see the recently redone reflecting pool upgrades. I was partly hoping for a good sunset with pre-Isaac clouds. Instead, some storms bubbled up around sunset and continued to form into the early night. After taking refuge in the memorial I darted out into the lighter rain behind the storm and this was a 'lucky' shot--first of 2 from this angle before I pointed the camera toward the Washington Monument and Capitol."People (including a ton of Boy Scouts) run for cover as a storm hits D.C. with a leading edge of strong winds in July 2010.August 11, 2012 -- Ian writes: "A wall cloud underneath a strong (previously severe warned) storm passing south of Thurmont, Md.

The Simple Difference: Close Cultural and Linguistic Gaps to Save Lives of Hispanics
Juan Carlos Caicedo, M.D.
Assistant Professor of Surgery and Director of the Hispanic Transplant Program, Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine	Your life should not depend on your ability to understand the doctor's written instructions. Simply not having a Spanish-speaking health care provider answering critical care questions can mean a patient will suffer and likely die. This is a problem getting bigger every day.

How I Reclaimed My Health
Harper Spero
Managing Director at Agent of Change	Over the past year I've started to take control of my own health. I've been going to yoga three times a week, eating healthier, making juice every morning and figuring out like-minded alternatives to living a better lifestyle with an immune deficiency.
Comments Type 1 Diabetes Finally Explained
Riva Greenberg
Diabetes advocate, author, speaker and coach	I got diabetes in February 1972 when I was 18 years old. I'm now 60. I've had diabetes more than four decades, more than two-thirds of my life. I have no memory of what life was like before "staying between the lines."
Comments (20) How I Stayed On Track on Vacation
Shealagh Whittle
Blogger	As my countdown to vacation crept closer and closer, I got a little scared -- how could I continue my newfound healthy eating habits in a city that for me holds all manner of delectable culinary sins?The answers turned out to be simple, and despite the fact that I have been largely ignoring my scale over the past month or two, I actually lost weight while I was in London.
Comments Autism Without Fear: In the Autism World, Maybe You Just ARE a Bad Parent
Michael John Carley
When a stranger gives you a dirty look because your child is upset in the supermarket, you might dissolve in shame, or you might confront the dirty-look perpetrator. But neither response is right. If your child is upset, he needs and deserves your attention more than that stranger.
Comments 10 Reasons I'm a Funeral Director
Caleb Wilde
Sixth generation licensed funeral director	Perhaps there's no greater freedom than to live life with a healthy relationship with death. That healthy relationship allows you embracing each moment, realizing that we are not promised tomorrow. This good relationship with death has been given to me by the funeral profession.
Comments Women: Our Disease Is Perfection
Dr. Amy Shah
Double board certified in Internal Medicine and Allergy & Immunology	In order for us to continue to advance in the workplace and home, we must literally and figuratively remove the airbrushed media images of female success and tame our own unrealistic expectations for ourselves.
Comments My Drug and Alcohol History Reads Like a Sad Handwritten Book
Allison Hudson
Blogger, www.itsalushlife.com	By the time I acknowledged my defeat, I had two choices. I could continue on the road I was on, unwilling to accept help, eventually ending with death, or I could accept help, admitting I was powerless over alcohol and begin a road of recovery. I chose the latter.
Comments The Next Transformation in American Healthcare
Brian Castrucci
Chief Program and Strategy Officer, de Beaumont Foundation	The crisis in American healthcare today is the ascendance of chronic conditions, which can't be fixed with a pill or procedure. We are seeing a transition from predominantly biological, physiological, and microbial origins of disease to diseases caused by social and environmental conditions.
Comments When Your Body Says 'No More Screens'
Lori Leibovich
Executive Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post	It hurts to do my job, lift my daughter, carry grocery bags, or make it through the day without popping Advils. The message my body is sending is clear: Stop typing, tapping and scrolling, now.
Comments March Is National Kidney Month: Let's Get Back to Basics
Leslie Spry, M.D., FACP
National Kidney Foundation spokesperson; Medical director, Dialysis Center of Lincoln, Neb.	Kidney Disease kills more people each year than breast and prostate cancer combined. Yes, you read that statistic correctly, but you may be surprised by it.
Comments The Toughest Race My Daughter and I Ever Ran
Andi Sligh
Author, There's Sunshine Behind the Clouds	It's hard to believe that it was so hard for her, when in the past it's been (relatively) easy. But when the pain of the day had subsided just a bit, I recalled one of the mantras of slow distance runners: "Dead Last Finish is greater than Did Not Finish, which trumps Did Not Start."
Comments A Picture Day Moment
Ariane Zurcher
Writer & Blogger: Emma's Hope Book, Where Art & Life Meet	Teachers are trained in a definition of autism that is incorrect. A definition that includes and assumes intellectual disability, which is connected to an inability to make oneself understood, low IQ, problematic behaviors and social impairment.
Comments Cloudy With a Chance of Meatheads
David Katz, M.D.
Director, Yale Prevention Research Center	As long we impart to nutrition the mediagenic volatility associated with the weather, we can all but guarantee that our understanding of what is good for us will remain very much clouded over. There will also be a very high chance of us acting like meatheads -- and being fed a steady diet of headlines accordingly.
Comments It's Your Choice: Creating Opportunity Where You Least Expect
Carol J. Carter
Author and student success expert	Our hardiness, grit, adaptability, and perspective are some of the ways we can use these unwanted circumstances as an opportunity to help us fulfill our goals. A great example of a person who turned his circumstance into opportunity is Woody Roseland.
Comments Do Brain Games Really Boost Brain Power?
Sandra Bond Chapman, Ph.D.
Cognitive neuroscientist; Founder and Chief Director, Center for BrainHealth, University of Texas at Dallas	With all the buzz about brain games -- such as crossword puzzles, Sudoku, and even brain training websites -- it begs the question: Can brain games be beneficial to brain health? As a cognitive neuroscientist, this is a question I get asked a lot. And the answer is yes and no.
Comments (19) Adhering to CPAP Therapy Takes Perseverance, Accommodations, and Expertise
Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine
On detailed questioning he reported the full-face mask was, "just too big, leaked too much, and left marks on his face." He was never told that masks are available in different sizes and, more importantly, can come in different styles, including nasal pillows and nasal triangular devices.
Comments Warning: Your Compliment to That Pregnant Woman Was an Insult
Catherine Alford
Founder, www.BudgetBlonde.com	When will female bodies just be left alone? Must we always be on display for everyone to see, judge, measure and discuss? Is it really that difficult to offer a kind word to each other?
Comments (13) It Doesn't Matter What My Daughter Looks Like
Kate Fridkis
Author of Growing Eden, blogger at Eat the Damn Cake	It's weird to think that I started out like this, too. That we all do. A brilliant jumble of sensors sensing excitedly all at once.

Splits in Banking Industry Beginning to Surface	Read More:

Comments
In a very encouraging sign for those of us trying to reform banking law, there are growing signs of splits in the banking industry. In the letters to the editor printed last week in the NY Times and American Banker, two leaders in the banking industry both come out strongly in favor of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency Act, the very important and very strong centerpiece of the Obama administration's financial regulatory reform proposals. The authors of the letters were Gerard P. Cuddy, Chair and CEO of Philadelphia's Beneficial Bank, and Jack Stack, Chair and CEO of Ceska Sporitelna, Czech Republic, and formerly a top executive for 22 years for Chemical Bank and Chase Bank.
These letters are significant but not surprising to me, as I think they represent the views of a lot of bankers around the country who do not work for Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan Chase or Bank of America. In my book tour and other speaking assignments I have done over the last six months, I have run across several community bankers, Savings and Loan and Credit Union execs who agreed with me very strongly that too big to fail is too big to exist, and that tougher banking regulations on the big banks were desperately needed. I hope and believe there will be more business leaders coming out in the next few weeks breaking with the big banking conglomerates on Wall St., because we need to start regulating these behemoths far more aggressively than we do now. Anything we can do to lessen their market power would be a major boon not only to consumers but to our entire economy.
Letters to the editor written by Gerard P. Cuddy, President and Chief Executive of Beneficial Bank and Jack Stack, former chairman and CEO of Ceska Sporitelna, the largest bank in the Czech Republic and a 30 year veteran of the banking industry are posted here.
