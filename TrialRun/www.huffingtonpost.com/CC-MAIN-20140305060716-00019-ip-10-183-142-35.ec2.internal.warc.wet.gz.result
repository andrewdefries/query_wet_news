Grilled Bananas with Coconut-Caramel Sauce

Servings
To paraphrase Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams, if you grill it, they will come. Such turned out to be the case for a Bangkok grill mistress named Saisuwan. Five years ago, she scraped together enough cash to set up a pushcart on Charoen Krung Road behind the Sheraton Hotel. Her grilling skills became so legendary, guidebooks from all over the world sing her praises. Saisuwan serves just one dishbut what a dishgrilled bananas slathered with coconut caramel sauce. You can eat them for breakfast, as a snack, or for dessert, and the moment you finish, you’ll very likely find yourself returning for seconds. If you happen to find yourself near the Sheraton hotel in Bangkok, you’ll recognize Saisuwan by her trademark white cap and by the sweet scent of bananas grilling over coconut shell charcoal. I give two versions of the caramel sauce. The first is how it’s made in Thailand, with palm sugar and coconut milk simply boiled together. The second is how a Frenchman might make the sauce: The sugar is cooked to a deep golden caramel, then enriched with coconut milk.	Ingredients
FOR THE SAUCE:
1/2 cup palm sugar or light brown sugar (see Notes)
1 cup unsweetened coconut milk (see page 503)
8 apple bananas, or 4 conventional bananas EQUIPMENT:
Flat bamboo skewers (optional) Directions
FOR THE SAUCE:
Make the coconut-caramel sauce: Version #1: Combine the palm sugar and coconut milk in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking to dissolve the sugar. Let the coconut mixture simmer briskly until it is thick, golden, and very flavorful, about 5 minutes, whisking often. Remove the pan from the heat and let the coconut-caramel sauce cool to room temperature. Place the sauce in a deep bowl. It can be prepared up to a day ahead and refrigerated, covered. Let the coconut-caramel sauce return to room temperature before using.
Version #2: Place the sugar in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat and cook the sugar until it melts, turns golden brown, becomes very fragrant, and starts to smoke, 3 to 6 minutes. Swirl the pan so the sugar cooks evenly, but do not stir it. Don’t let the sugar burn. As soon as the sugar browns, remove the pan from the heat and add the coconut milk. Stand backthe mixture will hiss and sputter like Mount Vesuvius. Return the mixture to the heat and let simmer, whisking, until the sugar dissolves completely. Let the coconut-caramel sauce cool to room temperature. Place the sauce in a shallow bowl. The caramel sauce can be prepared up to a day ahead and refrigerated, covered.
FOR THE BANANAS:
Set up the grill for direct grilling and preheat it to high.
When ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Peel the bananas and skewer them through one end, if desired. Grill the bananas until they are lightly browned and partially cooked, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Dip the bananas in the coconut-caramel sauce (that’s where the skewer comes in handy) or brush the bananas on all sides, using a basting brush, and return them to the grill. Continue grilling the bananas until they are darkly browned and sizzling, 1 to 3 minutes per side longer. Use a bamboo skewer to test for doneness; it should easily pierce the banana. Transfer the bananas to a platter or bowls. Spoon the remaining coconut-caramel sauce on top and serve at once. Notes: Palm sugar is the traditional sweetener of Thailand. Don’t worry if you can’t find it: In this recipe, it’s virtually indistinguishable from light brown sugar.
The bananas used for grilling in Thailand tend to be harder and starchier than their North
American counterparts. So grill masters, like Saisuwan, use a two-step grilling process, partially flattening the bananas with a heavy weight halfway through. This helps the bananas grill more evenly. To do this, transfer the bananas to a cutting board after the first 1 to 2 minutes of grilling and lightly flatten them with a scaloppine pounder or the side of a heavy cleaver. Dip each banana in the coconut-caramel sauce, or brush both sides with the sauce, and return the bananas to the grill. Continue grilling the bananas until they are golden brown and cooked through, 1 to 3 minutes longer per side.

It seems like a simple idea: Roadways should be safe for all users, whether they drive, ride public transit, bike or walk. But Detroit is the 12th-most dangerous metro area for pedestrians in the country, and the region has a long way to go.
In April 2010, Detroit received a federally-funded grant from the Michigan Department of Community Health to support efforts to pass "Complete Streets" policies, which dictate that pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders of all ages and abilities must be able to safely move along and across a complete street. The Detroit Complete Streets Coalition was born, bringing together an all-star team comprising many advocacy groups, including the Michigan Trails & Greenways Alliance, Department of Public Works, City Planning Commission, Detroit Department of Transportation, Detroit Police Department, Detroit Food & Fitness Collaborative, Wayne State University, City Connect Detroit, Michigan Trails and Greenways Alliance, Southeast Michigan Council of Governments, Transit Riders United and plenty of committed community members. Its mission is to bring complete streets policies to life in Detroit, but its members won't be starting from scratch.
"It's the best city I've ridden a bike in," said Todd Scott, Detroit Greenways coordinator for the Michigan Trails & Greenway Alliance.
Citywide, changes are going into effect that are steadily making Detroit more accessible for walkers and cyclists. This year, the Southwest Detroit Greenway installed bike lanes and routes throughout the neighborhood.
The Southwest Detroit Greenway had been in the works for while, but had some fits and starts. The Greater Corktown Development Corp. had been supporting the project, until the group went defunct. A mix of funding from the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan, Tour de Troit, and MDOT finally made the project a reality.
"Almost all the projects have occurred because there's a local champion who wants to see it happen," Scott explained. When complete, there will be 24 miles of new bike lanes and 11 miles of marked bike routes in the area.
Complete Streets has also been working to get an ordinance passed by the city that would affirm a commitment to pedestrian and bicycle safety. Currently, the ordinance is in the Law Department and will next be introduced to City Council for a vote.
The coalition is also working to get the Detroit Non-motorized Master Plan implemented. The document was passed by City Council and calls for 400 miles of bike lanes in the city. Next year will see the beginning stages of a north-south greenway connecting Cass Tech High School to the Fisher Building, converting Second Ave. and Third St. into two-way streets with bike lanes. Scott and others are working to make the city more bike-friendly in a variety of ways. Valuable online resources are making bike riding easier and safer -- Google Maps shows Detroit bike routes, and two informational Wikipedia pages, Cycling in Detroit and Trails in Detroit, are frequently updated.
Scott said there is sometimes concern that people will not take advantage of the projects Michigan Trails and Greenways has implemented, but anecdotal evidence (for example, the often crowded revamped Riverfront) and community information show how much the greenways are impacting the lives of Detroiters. While the Motor City's automobile heritage is often celebrated, Scott reminds people not to overlook the long legacy of cycling in Detroit. Biking advocates went on to become the founders of the auto industry, from the Dodge brothers, who first made bicycles, to Henry Ford, whose first car, the Quadricycle, was made using bike parts. And motorists have been amenable to the recent greenways changes -- Scott said that bike riders in Southwest have been surprised at how well drivers share the road and adhere to the new traffic rules for bike lanes.
And biking seems to be making a comeback. "We've seen a tremendous uptick in people out walking and biking," Scott said. "We really just want to see more and more folks choosing to walk and bike and building a healthier, more sustainable, more green community." FOLLOW HUFFPOST DETROIT

Jamaica's Usain Bolt gestures as he prepares to compete in a men's 100-meter heat during the athletics in the Olympic Stadium at the 2012 Summer Olympics, London, Saturday, Aug. 4, 2012.
LONDON -- There's been a whole lot of hype at the 2012 Summer Games about Usain Bolt, Yohan Blake and the men's 100-meter final Sunday night. Yet Jamaica didn't need to wait for those two guys to resume the island nation's Olympic supremacy in sprint events.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce took care of that.
Running with a golden ribbon tying back her hair, and a golden chain jangling around her neck, Fraser-Pryce earned a medal of that hue, too, winning a second consecutive Olympic title in the women's 100 by outleaning Carmelita Jeter of the U.S. to finish in 10.75 seconds Saturday night.
"Back in 2008, Usain Bolt was the first to get a gold medal," Fraser-Pryce said, "and now a woman is in charge."
And she had company: Veronica Campbell-Brown gave Jamaica the bronze.
With a population of 3 million - about 1 percent of the people who live in the United States - Jamaica now has six of the last seven gold medals awarded in the men's and women's Olympic sprints, including relays. Three of those belong to Bolt, who swept the 100, 200 and 4x100 in Beijing, each in world-record time.
Given Bolt's success and fame, Fraser-Pryce is overshadowed back home. Even if she was good enough to become the first woman since American Gail Devers in 1992 and 1996 to win two Olympic 100s in a row.
"Sometimes I go to the supermarket, and they ask me questions about Usain," Fraser-Pryce said. "They're like, 'Where is Usain? Do you train with Usain?'"
Still, anyone familiar with the sport's history in Jamaica knows what a significant role women such as Merlene Ottey and Campbell-Brown - who own a combined 15 Olympic medals - have played in making running the national pastime.
"Jamaicans - I wouldn't call them 'greedy' - but they expect a lot from us," Fraser-Pryce said.
Everyone expects a lot from the men's dash, the marquee race in track and field.
In addition to being the reigning Olympic champion, Bolt owns the world record of 9.58 seconds.
Blake is the world champion, and he also beat Bolt in the 100 and 200 at the Jamaican Olympic trials.
Then there's the third Jamaican in the men's 100 field, Asafa Powell, who held the world record from 2005 until 2008, when Bolt bettered it.
"Who will win tomorrow? I don't know," Fraser-Pryce said. "I hope they go 1-2-3."
A couple of Americans - Tyson Gay, a past world champion, and Justin Gatlin, a past Olympic champion - might have something to say about that.
Then again, even they know Bolt is the man to beat.
"He's the equivalent of the guy walking on the moon for the first time. He's done something that no one has ever done before. You have to line up in the blocks, shoulder-to-shoulder, with this guy? You're going to be in awe sometimes," Gatlin said. "I think a lot of runners almost have that audience mentality: See what he's going to do, even while you're running. You've got to block that out, go out there and compete against that guy."
Easier said than done.
Before Gatlin and others line up for the start, Sunday's track and field schedule includes the women's marathon in the morning. At night, in addition to the semifinals and final of the men's 100, Sanya Richards-Ross will compete in the women's 400 final, and medals will be awarded in the women's triple jump, men's hammer throw and the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase.
Jamaica's women went 1-2-3 in the 100 at Beijing, but a chance at a three-medal sweep this time vanished when Kerron Stewart couldn't make it out of the semifinals.
Given what Fraser-Pryce and Campbell-Brown did in the final, there was sure to be a little extra celebrating going on in Jamaica. They're already in a partying mood there, because the 50th anniversary of the country's independence from Britain is Monday.
On Aug. 5, 1962, the Union Jack was lowered for the final time at National Stadium in Kingston. Talk about perfect bookends: The Jamaican flag will be raised in Olympic Stadium on Sunday for Fraser-Pryce's medal ceremony. Might happen again Monday, if Bolt, Blake or Powell comes through.
"The excitement has already started," Fraser-Pryce said. "For me, what's really kind of exciting is, we got our independence from England and now we're here in England and we get our first medal. For me, that kind of tops it off."

PHOENIX -- Authorities say a man's pet emu is dead after it escaped from its home and was chased around a suburban Phoenix neighborhood.
Tempe police and workers from the Phoenix Zoo tried to corral the bird as it ran wild in the area of McKellips Road and College Avenue.
Police say the bird didn't belong to the zoo and that the private owner had "Ichabod" for 35 years.
KNXV-TV (http://bit.ly/18yE3Pc) says the emu was tackled by police officers, but apparently succumbed to the heat.

Technology News
By Jim Finkle BOSTON (Reuters) - In the world of cyber fraud, a fake fan on Instagram can be worth five times more than a stolen credit card number. As social media has become increasingly influential in shaping reputations, hackers have used their computer skills to create and sell false endorsements - such as "likes" and "followers" - that purport to come from users of Facebook, its photo-sharing app Instagram, Twitter, Google's YouTube, LinkedIn and other popular websites. In the latest twist, a computer virus widely used to steal credit card data, known as Zeus, has been modified to create bogus Instagram "likes" that can be used to generate buzz for a company or individual, according to cyber experts at RSA, the security division of EMC Corp. These fake "likes" are sold in batches of 1,000 on Internet hacker forums, where cyber criminals also flog credit card numbers and other information stolen from PCs. According to RSA, 1,000 Instagram "followers" can be bought for $15 and 1,000 Instagram "likes" go for $30, whereas 1,000 credit card numbers cost as little as $6. It may seem odd that fake social media accounts would be worth more than real credit card numbers, but online marketing experts say some people are willing to spend heavily to make a splash on the Internet, seeking buzz for its own sake or for a business purpose, such as making a new product seem popular. "People perceive importance on what is trending," said Victor Pan, a senior data analyst with WordStream, which advises companies on online marketing. "It is the bandwagon effect." Facebook, which has nearly 1.2 billion users, said it is in the process of beefing up security on Instagram, which it bought last year for $1 billion. Instagram, which has about 130 million active users, will have the same security measures that Facebook uses, said spokesman Michael Kirkland. He encouraged users to report suspicious activity through links on Facebook sites and apps. "We work hard to limit spam on our service and prohibit the creation of accounts through unauthorized or automated means," Kirkland said. KNOWING WHEN TO STOP The modified Zeus virus is the first piece of malicious software uncovered to date that has been used to post false "likes" on a social network, according to experts who track cyber crime. Fraudsters most commonly manipulate "likes" using automated software programs. The modified version of Zeus controls infected computers from a central server, forcing them to post likes for specific users. They could also be given marching orders to engage in other operations or download other types of malicious software, according to RSA. Cyber criminals have used Zeus to infect hundreds of millions of PCs since the virus first surfaced more than five years ago, according to Don Jackson, a senior security researcher with Dell SecureWorks. That the virus is now being adapted to target Instagram is a sign of the rising importance of social media in marketing, and the increasing sophistication of hackers trying to profit from the trend. Online marketing consultant Will Mitchell said he sometimes advises clients to buy bogus social-networking traffic, but only to get an early foothold online. When asked about the ethics of faking endorsements, Mitchell replied, "It's fine to do for the first 100, but I always advise stopping after that." He said one of his clients once bought more than 300,000 "likes" on Facebook against his advice, a move that Mitchell felt damaged the client's reputation. "It was just ridiculous," he said. "Everybody knew what they were doing." Still, experts say schemes to manipulate social networks are unlikely to go away. Creating fake social media accounts can also be used for more nefarious purposes than creating fake "likes," such as identity theft. "The accounts are always just a means to an end. The criminals are always looking to profit," said computer security expert Chris Grier, a University of California at Berkeley research scientist who spent a year working on a team that investigated fake accounts on Twitter.

Hey! That's MineOne of the app's ultimate sins? Copycating. Make your own content and respect your fellow Instagrammers. It's not polite (or entirely legal) to take a screen shot of another person's photo, change the filter, and pretend like it's your own. Avoid The ClicheThere are things you're going to want to snap a picture of -- cats, the shoes on your feet, greasy food, an artsy shot of nothing, etc. -- but beware of falling into an Instagram cliche. Followers don't mind these pictures every once in awhile, but give your fans something new to keep them coming back for more. We Don't Want To See ThatSome pictures are <a href="http://instagr.am/legal/terms/" target="_hplink">best left unposted</a>. You would think this would go without saying, but unfortunately it must be mentioned. Drugs, porn, pictures of you on the toilet, pictures of your "friends" on the toilet, a broken toenail: These are all perfect examples of what followers just don't want to see. (If we can't see it, then it's not real. So please don't let us see it.)Beware The Rapid FireIt's totally fine to take several photos and upload them to Instagram the same day. You're crossing a line, however, when you don't use Instagram for a week and suddenly spam your followers with 14 uploads in a matter of six minutes.#ThatsAnnoyingHashtags help Instagramers categorize pictures, or are used ironically much like on Twitter. For example, if you take a picture of the Statue of Liberty, a proper hashtag might be #nyc. But drowning a photo in irrelevant hashtags will only frustrate viewers. There is such a thing as #toomuch. Show A Little 'Selfie' ControlPictures you take of yourself might be fine, but too many "selfie" shots annoy followers. Who wants to see three or four Instagrams of a face in different positions? Refrain from taking MySpace pictures and flip that camera around on someone else occasionally. Be My FriendIt's okay to want more followers on your social media sites, but isn't it a little desperate to type "please follow me!" in the comments box of pictures and throughout your "About Me" section? Create great content, regularly participate with other users, and you are guaranteed to earn followers without begging for them.Baby OverloadYour children are adorable, and who wouldn't love that dog always featured on your Instagram? But similar to selfie shots, these objects of your affection may begin to grow old for your friends... particularly if you upload 16 photos of little Sue daily. Sometimes one picture says it all.Like, Like, Follow, UnfollowIf you "like" a photo, then it's assumed you found that picture to be aesthetically pleasing. What is not assumed is that you expected a "like" or a "follow" in return. And don't even think about unfollowing someone because they didn't follow you back. This sort of middle school behavior is not appreciated. "Like" worthy pictures for the sake of liking them. Don't Draw SomethingYour followers want to see your beautiful or surprising photos. What they don't want to see is something that won't make sense to them, like an inside joke that you drew about a donkey and a pancake. In this case, it's best to just keep your doodles to yourself. The Catch-All RuleHere are Instagram words to live by: Document life, show off your quirky moments, and tell a vibrant, filter-filled story. Post those pics you're proud of, and your followers will probably "like" them, too. Contribute to this Story: Send us a tip

Warning: Some of the images below may be considered disturbing to some readers.
"In our society, breast cancer is hidden behind a small pink bow. The public needs to be educated."
This is the message behind The Scar Project, a photography series dedicated to young breast cancer survivors. Shot by fashion photographer David Jay, the large-scale portrait endeavor features the faces and bodies of over 100 women who have battled and bested early-onset cancer.
As the project's name suggests, the photographs showcase the many scars of women age 18 to 35 who have undergone mastectomies as a result of a breast cancer diagnosis. The series shines a spotlight on the fact that over 10,000 women under the age of 40 will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year alone -- a stark reality that younger woman often overlook.
Jay's photographs aim to raise awareness of these breast cancer statistics as well as provide a platform for survivors to confront their harrowing experiences. “For these young women, having their portrait taken seems to represent their personal victory over this terrifying disease," Jay explains on The Scar Project website. "It helps them reclaim their femininity, their sexuality, identity and power after having been robbed of such an important part of it."
Jay began the project after his 29-year-old friend, Paulina, was diagnosed with breast cancer and subsequently decided to have a mastectomy. He asked if he could photograph her after the surgery, and from there, the project mushroomed, leading to over 100 portraits of various woman and a Facebook page supported by over 40,000 fans. The works have been published in a book and, in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, are currently on on view in an exhibition in Houston.
"Through these simple pictures, [the women] seem to gain some acceptance of what has happened to them and the strength to move forward with pride," Jay explained to The Huffington Post.
Scroll through a preview of "The Scar Project" below and let us know your thoughts on Jay's striking portraits in the comments. How are you honoring Breast Cancer Awareness Month?
