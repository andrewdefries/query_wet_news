Paul Ryan Is a Charlatan, Not a Serious 'Policy Wonk'
Peter Dreier
E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental College	For too long, reporters have been bamboozled by Ryan, who claims to be a both a budget expert and something of a social philosopher. But he's just a slick talker who appears to have flunked basic math in high school or college, because his budget numbers never add up.

An Un-American Wolf in Religious Liberty's Clothing
Roger Fisk
Writer and Communications Consultant	What's funny, in a macabre way, is the effort to re-impose religion's will is dressed up as the next chapter in the same civil rights struggle that cleansed the public square of the zealot's self-proclaimed authority to begin with.
Comments (13) Federal Court: If You Buy a Girl, You're a Sex Trafficker
Kevin M. Ryan
President and CEO, Covenant House	A U.S. Federal Circuit Court has ruled that customers who arrange for or have sex with children under age 18 are to be considered human traffickers. Wow. That's a big and heavy stick we can use to protect kids who are forced into having sex for someone else's profit.
Comments The Pentagon's Phony Budget War
Mattea Kramer
Research director, National Priorities Project	Despite cries of doom since the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration surfaced in Washington in 2011, the Pentagon has seen few actual reductions, and there is no indication that will change any time soon.
Comments It Turns Out, Obamacare Actually Does Care
Robert J. Elisberg
Screenwriter and columnist	Even if a person doesn't qualify for an ACA health plan, you -- and by "you" I mean everyone -- still get the benefits of the new law. And much of this has very real, and very substantive financial savings -- just not the financial savings you read about in the news about monthly bills.
Comments Let's Fix a Justice System That Isn't Working
Harry Belafonte
Entertainer & Activist	There is a crisis that demands our urgent attention. For the last four decades, this country has been obsessed with expanding the number of people we throw behind bars and the length of time we hold them there.
Comments (25) There's No Need to End Saturday Mail Delivery
Sen. Bernie Sanders
Independent U.S. Senator from Vermont	The Postal Service is under constant and vicious attack. Why? The answer is simple. There are very powerful and wealthy special interests who want to privatize or dismember virtually every function that government now performs, whether it is Social Security, Medicare, public education or the Postal Service.
Comments (122) Understanding CBO's Minimum-Wage Report
Scott Lilly
Senior fellow, Center for American Progress	As the uproar over the CBO analysis demonstrates, the issue of whether jobs are gained or lost as a result of a minimum-wage increase depends largely on how we analyze the vast amount of research that has been conducted on the question over the past half-century.
Comments Why Being My Brother's Keeper Matters
Gov. Deval Patrick
Governor, Massachusetts	As a black man, my heart aches over the disproportionate numbers of men and boys of color left back by schools, left out of jobs and caught up in crime. As a black public official, I am struck by how little appetite there seems to be among law makers to deal with the root causes of this.
Comments (14) The Afghan Ballet: Why Washington Doesn't Want to Leave Afghanistan
Tom Engelhardt
Editor, TomDispatch.com	Washington and Kabul have, for endless months, been performing a strange pas de deux over the issue of American withdrawal. The less Karzai complied, the more Obama administration and Pentagon officials betrayed an overwhelming need to stay.
Comments On a Random Day in the U.S. There Are More Than 66,000 Requests for Help Escaping Domestic Violence
Soraya Chemaly
Feminist, Writer, Satirist... not always in that order	The dynamics of domestic violence are complex and changing them requires not just one thing to change, but many things simultaneously.
Comments Outing the Deep State
Robert Koehler
Syndicated writer	Can we actually build a world that isn't run by its shadow interests? And what is this going to take? Can good will and big principles stand up to Wall Street and the Washington consensus?
Comments Not a Big Fan of My Brother's Keeper
César Vargas
Producer, activist, and social media strategist	Poor people are under a great deal of stress. Their spirits are under a lot of stress. To tell them that they have no excuse is not just irresponsible. It's dangerous.
Comments President Obama, Say 'No' to Keystone XL Pipeline
Alan Robock
Distinguished Professor of Climatology, Rutgers University; director, Rutgers Undergraduate Meteorology Program	Wouldn't it make much more sense to hire people to construct wind turbines, install solar panels, and build the new electric grid we need? Wouldn't it make more sense to invest in battery technology and the other developments we will need for a fossil-free future?
Comments Why Retirement Security for Women Is Not an Option
Dedrick Muhammad
Senior Director of Economic Programs, NAACP	March marks Women's History Month -- a time for celebrating women's historic gains and achievements. But, equally important, especially in this sluggish economic recovery, is amplifying the contemporary economic challenges women continue to face, including the uphill climb to retirement security.
Comments Michele Bachmann Didn't Care for Religious Tolerance Until AZ Law
Cathy Reisenwitz
DC-based writer and political commentator	What seems to upset Bachmann is that America is waking up to the fact that a culture which used to dominate, the one where it's cool to discriminate against gays and pretend the Jim Crow south was fun and make racist jokes is losing ground.
Comments Momentum Builds in Puerto Rico for Major Marijuana Reforms
Adrian Brito
Law Student, Writer	If this happens, Puerto Rico will become the first American territory to legalize medical marijuana and decriminalize marijuana possession.
Comments Why All LGBT People Should Care About Places Like Russia, Uganda and Gambia
Kevin Jennings
Executive Director, Arcus Foundation	As barriers to legal equality seem to be falling like dominoes in the United States, it's easy for LGBT Americans and their allies to feel a sense of giddiness. But even as the momentum in the U.S. seems to be accelerating in the right direction, a disturbing countertrend has emerged.
Comments Crimea: The End Game
Joe Peyronnin
Hofstra Journalism Professor	The Ukrainian crisis has nothing to do with Benghazi, nor is it the result of a weak American president. Now the question is will Putin really want to take the off ramp or deescalate tensions? Or might he be inclined to play this chess match out in a different way?
