Entertainment News
NEW YORK (AP) — Hollywood may be hoping for a little less drama in 2014.2013 was a tale of two cinemas. Blockbusters like "The Lone Ranger" and "After Earth" flopped spectacularly while many in the industry (including Steven Spielberg) bemoaned the increasingly commercial trajectory of the studios. And yet by the end of the year, Hollywood had set a record with nearly $11 billion in revenue, while critics hailed the year's crop as one of the best in years.How will 2014 unfold? The plot, at least, will be unchanged, with Hollywood moving to the familiar pattern of sketchy spring releases, summer superhero blockbusters and fall awards-contenders.Here are 10 things to look for at the movies in 2014:STELLAR SCI-FIAnticipation runs especially high for "Interstellar" (Nov. 7), Christopher Nolan's deep space travel adventure starring Matthew McConaughey. Nolan, the director of "Inception" and "The Dark Knight," is one of few directors whose name alone makes fanboys salivate. His imprimatur promises a cinematic experience (he likes to shoot with IMAX cameras) that few today can match. Nolan's name also looms large in "Transcendence" (April 18), which he produced. The artificial intelligence tale, starring Johnny Depp is the directorial debut of Nolan's longtime cinematographer Wally Pfister.HOLD-OVERS FROM 2013 This year will benefit from last year's unusually good leftovers. George Clooney's World War II art rescue tale "The Monuments Men" will open Feb. 7 after being delayed from December. James Grey's Ellis Island drama "The Immigrant" (undated), starring Joaquin Phoenix and Marion Cottilard, could emerge as an Oscar dark horse after earning acclaim on the festival circuit. Bennett Miller's "Foxcatcher," featuring a dark turn from Steve Carell, will bow sometime in 2014. "Grace of Monaco," with Nicole Kidman as Grace Kelly, opens March 14.MARVEL's EXPANDING UNIVERSEMarvel's world domination continues with "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" (April 4), "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" (May 2), "X-Men: Days of Future Past" (May 23) and "Guardians of the Galaxy" (Aug. 1). The last, the lone non-sequel, represents Marvel's reach for another ensemble team-up film, and, with a cast including Chris Pratt and Bradley Cooper, perhaps something a little different than its usual output.MUSICALS SING AGAINThough 2013 contained no major live-action musical, several are coming this year. Clint Eastwood, of all people, directs the screen adaptation of the hit production about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons in "Jersey Boys" (June 20). "Annie" (Dec. 19), produced by Will Smith and Jay Z, will get a contemporary update with "Beasts of the Southern Wild" star Quvenzhane Wallis as the titular orphan. Rob Marshall ("Chicago") will transfer James Lapine and Steven Sondheim's Grimm fable "Into the Woods" to the big screen (Dec. 25), with Meryl Streep as the Witch and Depp as the Big Bad Wolf.SURE BETS FROM VETERAN HANDSPaul Thomas Anderson ("There Will Be Blood," ''The Master") releases have become the highlight of many a movie buff's year. His "Inherent Vice" (not yet dated), adapted from Thomas Pynchon's novel and starring Phoenix, continues the director's series of California-set films. Also hotly anticipated is David Fincher's version of Gillian Flynn's best-selling thriller, "Gone Girl" (Oct. 3), starring Ben Affleck. Other directors to watch in 2014 include Wes Anderson ("The Grand Budapest Hotel," March 7) and Woody Allen ("Magic in the Moonlight," undated).BEARDED MEN OF THE BIBLEThis year will boast not just a Noah, but also a Moses. First will come Darren Aronofsky's "Noah" (March 28), starring Russell Crowe and a very big boat. Ridley Scott will follow on Dec. 12 with "Exodus," starring Christian Bale as Moses. Greek mythology will also double up in 2014 with two Hercules movies. The demigod will be played by Dwayne Johnson in Brett Ratner's "Hercules" (July 25) and by Kellan Lutz in "The Legend of Hercules" (out Friday). More Greek warfare comes with the sequel "300: Rise of an Empire" (March 7).SEQUELS, REMAKES AND, AT LAST, A FINAL HOBBITNaturally, 2014 boasts a boatload of sequels and remakes including "Godzilla" (May 16), "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1" (Nov. 21), "Transformers: Age of Extinction" (June 27), "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" (July 11), "22 Jump Street" (June 13), "The Expendables 3" (Aug. 15) and "How to Train Your Dragon 2" (June 13). Peter Jackson will finally close out his lifetime with J.R.R. Tolkien with his final "Hobbit" installment: "The Hobbit: There and Back Again" (Dec. 17).THAT WAS NOT THE ENDCo-directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg will quickly follow up their 2013 hit "This Is the End" with "The Interview" (Oct. 10), a comedy starring James Franco as a talk-show host caught up in an assassination plot. Rogen also stars with Zac Efron in "Neighbors" (May 9), by "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" director Nicholas Stoller, about a young family living next to a frat house. The 2014 comedy lineup also includes "Dumb and Dumber To" (Nov. 14), with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels; the one-night-stand comedy "Walk of Shame" (April 25) with Elizabeth Banks; and "Sex Tape" (Aug. 1) with Cameron Diaz.JOLIE'S RETURNAngelina Jolie hasn't starred in a live-action film since 2010's forgettable "The Tourist," but she'll be a large presence in 2014. She stars as the title villain in "Maleficent" (May 30), the twisted "Sleeping Beauty" tale. She also directs her second feature in "Unbroken" (Dec. 25), a World War II prisoner-of-war drama co-scripted by Joel and Ethan Coen. Jolie's famous companion, Brad Pitt, stars in a WWII story of his own, "Fury" (Nov. 14), about an American tank crew in Nazi Germany.HUNTING THE HUNGER GAMESThe competition is thick for the next hit young-adult franchise. Among the films looking to draw teenage audiences with stories from popular young-adult novels are: the post-apocalyptic "Divergent" (March 21); the high-school vampire fantasy "Vampire Academy: Blood Sisters" (Feb. 14); and the sci-fi dystopia "The Maze Runner" (Sept. 19). May the odds be ever in your favor.___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jake_coyle

"Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones" (Jan. 3)Fun fact: this is not "Paranormal Activity 5." That film comes out in October."Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit" (Jan. 17)Paramount moved this Jack Ryan reboot from Christmas Day to Jan. 17, but that gambit should pay off: "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit," starring Paramount golden boy Chris Pine (the studio's "Star Trek" films), looks like the kind of action film that reaches sleeper blockbuster status simply because it doesn't have much competition."Ride Along" (Jan. 17)"A little man Smurf." That's how Ice Cube describes Kevin Hart in the "Ride Along" trailer, so lol see you at the theater."G.B.F." (Jan. 17)Darren Stein's indie gem, which debuted at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival, combines elements of Stein's own "Jawbreaker" with "Mean Girls," "Heathers" and "Clueless." <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/26/michael-j-willett-gbf_n_3163784.html" target="_blank">It's a must see</a>."That Awkward Moment" (Jan. 31)Hollywood's next great leading men (Miles Teller, Zac Efron and Michael B. Jordan) star in this R-rated comedy about love and relationships among Millennials. Fingers crossed that this one is as funny as the R-rated trailer."The LEGO Movie" (Feb. 7)You might not think a movie about LEGOs would be awesome, but "The LEGO Movie" trailer states otherwise. Phil Lord and Chris Miller ("21 Jump Street") direct the film, which features voice work from Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks, Cobie Smulders and Will Arnett among others."The Monuments Men" (Feb. 7)George Clooney's erstwhile Oscar contender was moved to 2014 to avoid the crunch of year-end 2013 releases. (It still looks great despite the date change.) Matt Damon, Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett all co-star."RoboCop" (Feb. 14)Even if the idea of a "RoboCop" remake sounds lame, consider this: The movie features Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, Michael Keaton and Jay Baruchel in supporting roles."About Last Night" (Feb.14)A remake of the 1986 dramedy with Rob Lowe and Demi Moore, this version of "About Last Night" stars Kevin Hart, Regina Hall, Joy Bryant and Michael Ealy."Vampire Academy" (Feb. 14)"Mean Girls" director Mark Waters returns with "Vampire Academy," an adaptation of Richelle Mead's YA series that was written for the screen by Daniel Waters ("Heathers")."Non-Stop" (Feb. 28)<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/16/non-stop-trailer_n_4109224.html" target="_blank">Yes to this one</a>."Welcome To Yesterday" (Feb. 28)"What if we made a found footage movie about time traveling high school kids?" "Sure.""The Grand Budapest Hotel" (March 7)Wes Anderson's new film includes the usual coterie of Anderson regulars (Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Adrien Brody, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson) and newcomers like Saoirse Ronan and Ralph Fiennes. "What happened, my dear Zero, is I beat the living shit out of a sniveling little runt called Pinky Bandinski." Where do we check in?"300: Rise of an Empire" (March 7)This. Is. Sparta. Again."Veronica Mars" (March 14)Marshmallows unite."Bad Words" (March 14)Jason Bateman's directorial debut, about an adult who exploits a loop hole to compete in spelling bee competitions with children, is an R-rated comedy in the vein of "Bad Santa." (Be warned, the trailer is filthy.) "Bad Words" premiered at 2013's Toronto International Film Festival in September."Grace of Monaco" (March 14)Like "The Monuments Men," "Grace of Monaco" was once considered a 2013 Oscar contender until a late-hour date change. "They want a commercial film, that is to say at the grass roots, removing everything above [...] removing all that is cinema, everything that makes life," <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/19/olivier-dahan-grace-of-monaco_n_4127981.html" target="_blank">director Olivier Dahan said</a> after the film, which The Weinstein Company is set to release in North America, was bumped. "Here, in this case, they made a trailer that did not fit the movie, and then they try to make the film look like the trailer, this is absurd." Watch that trailer here."Need for Speed" (March 14)The answer to the question: What if Aaron Paul starred in a "Fast and Furious" movie?"Divergent" (March 21)The next "Hunger Games"? Veronica Roth's dystopian YA series stars Shailene Woodley and Theo James, and brings with it expectations that threaten to overflow the Cornucopia. (Mixed franchises, but you get the drift.)"Muppets Most Wanted" (March 21)The Muppets are back, and this time they brought Tina Fey and Ricky Gervais."Stretch" (March 21)Joe Carnahan ("The Grey") returns with an indie thriller about "a chauffeur who takes a job for a billionaire who makes his life hell." Chris Pine, Jessica Alba, Patrick Wilson and Ray Liotta all co-star."Nymphomaniac Part 1" (March 21)THIS IS THE MOST NSFW TRAILER EVER. Ahem. ("Nymphomaniac Part 2" is out on April 18.)"Noah" (March 28)Bless Paramount for giving an auteur like Darren Aronofsky millions of dollars to make a crazy Biblical epic about Noah, of Noah's Ark fame."Breathe In" (March 28)Felicity Jones, who played a heartbreaker for director Drake Doremus in "Like Crazy," plays another one in his follow-up, "Breathe In." The film debuted at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and should finally premiere for general U.S. audiences in March."Captain America: The Winter Soldier" (April 4)Summer starts early in 2014 thanks to the Marvel release of "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" in April. This one looks great, right down to Robert Redford as the shady S.H.I.E.L.D. boss."Dom Hemingway" (April 4)Jude Law plays the title character in this raucous, violent and foul-mouthed British comedy about a low-life criminal fresh out of prison. HuffPost Entertainment saw a very early screening of this one and can report that Law has never been better."Under The Skin"In this creepy, David Lynch-ian thriller, Scarlett Johansson plays an alien. "Under the Skin" is weird, and judging from the early festival reviews, brilliant."Draft Day" (April 11)It's like "Moneyball," but with football and Kevin Costner."Sabotage" (April 11)Arnold Schwarzenegger is back, and this time it's in a movie that actually looks pretty good #alldisrespecttothelaststand #andescapeplan"St. Vincent De Van Nuys" (April 11)Try to pretend this movie doesn't sound great: "A young boy whose parents just divorced finds an unlikely friend and mentor in the misanthropic, bawdy, hedonistic, war veteran who lives next door." The misanthrope is played by Bill Murray. Melissa McCarthy, Chris O'Dowd and Naomi Watts all co-star."Only Lovers Left Alive" (April 11)Jim Jarmusch made a vampire movie with Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton. Ticket purchased."Transcendence" (April 18)Wally Pfister, the cinematographer behind Christopher Nolan's Batman films and "Inception," made his very own Christopher Nolan movie. "Transcendence" stars Johnny Depp as a scientist who winds up with his psyche transferred into a computer. Rebecca Hall, Kate Mara, Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman all co-star."The Other Woman" (April 25)Your new favorite comedy stars Leslie Mann, Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton as three women trying to get back at the man who cheated on them all (Mann plays his wife)."Locke" (April 25)Tom Hardy gets his own "Drive" from writer-director Steven Knight: "A man's life unravels during a 90-minutes race against time." Yep, in."The Amazing Spider-Man 2" (May 2)Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man kicks off the summer blockbuster season in style with "The Amazing Spider-Man 2." Expect multiple villains, more romance between Spidey (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and lots of toy sales."Neighbors" (May 9)Seth Rogen is now old enough to play the married guy who lives next door to the loud fraternity (here embodied by Zac Efron). The trailer for "Neighbors" includes a "Se7en" reference, so we're there."Chef" (May 9)Jon Favreau ("Iron Man") wrote, directed and stars in "Chef," a new comedy about a downtrodden chef. Favreau, famous for "Iron Man" and "Swingers," enlisted some of his A-list pals for the film, including Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Dustin Hoffman and Sofia Vergara."Godzilla" (May 16)Roar."Million Dollar Arm" (May 16)Here's what "Jerry Maguire" would look like if Jon Hamm was the star."Blended" (May 23)Your yearly Adam Sandler comedy."X-Men: Days of Future Past" (May 23)The "X-Men: Days of Future Past" cast is so big, Jennifer Lawrence has, like, ninth billing."Maleficent" (May 30)Angelina Jolie plays the evil queen in this new take on Disney's "Sleeping Beauty.""A Million Ways To Die In The West" (May 30)Seth MacFarlane's follow-up to "Ted" doesn't star a talking teddy bear, but does feature MacFarlane, Charlize Theron, Amanda Seyfried and Liam Neeson."Edge of Tomorrow" (June 6)Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt star in this sci-fi thriller from director Doug Liman."The Fault in Our Stars" (June 6)Shailene Woodley stars in her second YA adaptation of 2014 with "The Fault in Our Stars," based on John Green's beloved novel."22 Jump Street" (June 13)Still funny."How To Train Your Dragon 2" (June 13)Your kids are going to love this one."Jersey Boys" (June 20)Clint Eastwood directs this adaptation of the hit Broadway musical about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons."The Purge 2" (June 20)Frank Grillo stars in this sequel to "The Purge," last summer's low-budget horror thriller."Transformers: Age of Extinction" (June 27)Huge missed opportunity here by not calling the fourth "Transformers" film "Trans4mers.""Tammy" (July 2)Co-written by Melissa McCarthy and her husband, Ben Falcone, and directed by Falcone, "Tammy" is McCarthy's latest summer comedy. The film focuses on the title character (McCarthy) who loses her job and her husband and goes on a road trip with her grandmother. Susan Sarandon, Allison Janney, Kathy Bates and more co-star.
