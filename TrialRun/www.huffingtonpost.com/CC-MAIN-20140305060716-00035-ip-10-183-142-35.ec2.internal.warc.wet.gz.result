NASDAQ Shutdown Is Third Major Glitch In A Week, And Wall Street Doesn't Seem To Care

Business News
Many Wall Streeters calmly carried on Thursday as the Nasdaq Stock Market, the second-biggest U.S. exchange, shut down trading in thousands of equities for more than three hours because of a computer problem -- the third major trading disruption in a week. “There’s a lot of jokes going around about it,” Jamie Lissette, a trader in Westport, Conn., who moderates a private chat forum of professional traders. According to Lissette, people in the forum were passing the time wondering if the unexplained glitch had anything to do with Hollywood actor Richard Gere -- a nod both to an urban legend about that thespian’s experience with a gerbil, and the last major Nasdaq shutdowns, in 1994 and in 1987, caused by squirrels chewing through power lines. "We have 500 guys just sitting on their hands here," he said.
“The fact of the matter is, I’m surprised people don’t expect this to happen every five or 10 years,” Lissette added, explaining the computer systems underlying modern trading are so complicated, something is bound to break from time to time.
Officials at the all-electronic Nasdaq exchange, where trading volume is second to the rival New York Stock Exchange, halted trading in thousands of companies just before 12:15 p.m. New York time. A technical glitch in the computer system that disseminates quote information from Nasdaq to other trading platforms had caused “momentary interruptions” starting at 11 a.m., the officials said. A wider shutdown just after noon on Wall Street affected stocks of companies listed on Nasdaq, including Apple, Microsoft and Cisco Systems.
Trading of those securities was halted until 3:25 p.m. on Nasdaq’s platform, as well as on the New York Stock Exchange, regional exchanges like the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and rival electronic exchanges. Trading continued in private “dark pool” platforms, where large blocks of company shares are bought and sold by investors outside of the open exchanges.
Nasdaq gave no indication what caused the glitch, fueling speculation by traders that it may have been the result of a bank plugging a new high-frequency trading program into the exchange's servers. Others suggested the outage may be the work of malicious hackers.
Another possible cause was the deployment of a system meant to prevent wild fluctuations in the prices of stocks, which occurred across all U.S. exchanges this week, according to Sal Arnuk of Chatam, N.J.- based Themis Trading. Arnuk explained that most traders' acceptance of the shutdown was partly good luck. No major market-moving events were scheduled for Thursday afternoon, and late summer is traditionally a quiet time on Wall Street.
“We have this going for us, it’s an August, quiet day with very little going on in the world,” Arnuk said “At the same time, when you stop trading, you create uncertainty.”
The shutdown was the third major trading disruption in a week, following a glitch linked to the trading arm of Goldman Sachs on Tuesday and a computer error that caused securities in the Shanghai stock exchange to swing wildly on Friday.
Not all traders accepted Thursday's glitch with resignation and humor.
"Our initial read was that something was wrong, that something nefarious was up," Jim Russell, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, told The Wall Street Journal. "As word leaked out that this was more of an IT glitch, we were somewhat relieved."
Nasdaq officials emphasized that only stocks listed on the Nasdaq platform were not being traded and that shares of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange were not affected. Traders, however, said the malfunction temporarily affected all Wall Street trading. Most Wall Street trading is done by computer programs that compare prices for several stocks before executing a transaction. While it was theoretically possible to trade New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of IBM, for example, most programmatic trading would not proceed unless quotes for other tech companies like Microsoft were also available, which wasn’t the case during the shutdown.
Trading in exchange-traded funds listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but which contain baskets of Nasdaq-listed stocks, also continued. A representative for BlackRock, the New York firm that manages the largest portfolio of exchange-traded funds, had no immediate comment.
Notwithstanding those issues, Lissette, the Connecticut trader, said Wall Street was taking the unexpected interruption in stride.
“It’s a little bit odd that it’s going into hours,” Lissette said during the interruption, “ But if what happened was some sort of fail-safe to prevent a flash-crash or a rip, I think people would much rather have that than have the market go down 30 percent.”
In a statement after the close of trading, Nasdaq said it was investigating the day's "issues" and would "support any necessary steps to enhance the platform" in the future.

By Pamela Redmond Satran for NamberryBiblical names have always been popular for boys, and their influence has only risen in recent years. The dozen boys’ names here all stand below the Top 20. Eight derive from the Old Testament, three from the New, with one -- Michael -- figuring in both. A half century ago, there were fewer biblical names on the boys' Top 20 and more of those were from the New Testament. What hasn't changed is that all these names are well liked and have deep roots, and will serve any boy well. The most popular biblical names for boys today are:JacobJacob, the Number 1 boys’ name in the US for over a decade, is the name of one of the most important biblical patriarchs, with the 12 tribes of Israel evolving from his 12 sons. In the Old Testament, Jacob was the son of Isaac and Rebecca, the twin brother of Esau, and the husband of both Rachel and Leah.EthanEthan has risen to Number 3 on the boys’ popularity list more on the strength of Tom Cruise’s Mission Impossible character than on that of any biblical Ethan. The most prominent Old Testament Ethan -- there were several -- was praised for his wisdom. He authored Psalm 89 and may have been a cymbal player in King David’s court, pictured here. Meaning strong, Ethan is now the Number 3 name in the U.S.Noah Noah, the builder of the ark who is among the most familiar biblical figures to children, is a surprise baby name hit of recent years. Noah was hand-picked by God to survive the flood thanks to his righteousness, an upstanding namesake. Noah was said to have fathered three sons at the age of 100, impressive until you know he lived to be nearly 1000.MichaelMichael the Archangel figures in the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic religions. In the Book of Daniel, he’s mentioned as a defender of the Jewish people, and in The New Testament, he leads God’s armies in defeating Satan. Michael and Gabriel (or Mikhail and Jibreel) are the only archangels mentioned in the Quran. Michael has been a Top 10 name in the U.S. for over 70 years, including a long reign at Number 1.DanielThe story of Daniel in the lion’s den is one of the most familiar Biblical stories to children. A visionary and a prophet, Daniel has his own book of the bible and is honored in the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic faiths. As a boys’ name, Daniel manages to feel eternally youthful and traditional at the same time. Widely used for boys throughout American history, Daniel now sits just outside the Top 10.MatthewMatthew is another biblical name that strikes the golden classic-yet-stylish balance. The Gospel of Matthew is the first book of the New Testament. Matthew was one of the four evangelists and 12 disciples, and was also a witness to the resurrection and ascension of Christ. In the Top 10 since the early 1970s, meaning there are lots of dads out there with the name, Matthew has now slipped to Number 12.ElijahThe Old Testament Elijah is a relative newcomer to the ranks of popular biblical names for boys, having climbed to its current standing at Number 13 from a low of 689 in the late 1960s. Far more popular in the U.S. than in Europe, Elijah’s new fashion currency may derive something from its stylish sister name Eliza. Elijah in the Book of Kings was a miracle worker who raised the dead, rained fire from the sky, and ascended in a whirlwind.JamesThere are two major figures called James in the New Testament: James the Just, who is said to be a brother or stepbrother or cousin of Jesus, and James the Great, an apostle who is a son of Zebedee and became the patron saint of Spain. There was a second apostle named James, called James the Less and seldom mentioned in the Bible. James is one of the most fashionable classic boys’ names these days and a relative of Number 1 Jacob.BenjaminThe biblical Benjamin was a founder of one of the 12 tribes of Israel, the youngest son of Jacob and Rachel. A favorite since the 1970s, Benjamin’s antecedents also include Benjamin Franklin and baby guru Dr. Benjamin Spock. Superstar couples Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady as well as John Travolta and Kelly Preston are just a few of the modern parents who’ve recently chosen Benjamin with its friendly nickname Ben for their sons.JoshuaJoshua, an important Old Testament figure who led the Israelites to win the Battle of Jericho and reach the Promised Land, is among the first wave of biblical boys’ names rediscovered in the 1960s and 70s. There’s many a young dad named Josh, but Joshua is still Number 17 for babies too. The biblical Joshua commands respect as the recognized successor of Moses.AndrewAndrew is the name of the patron saint of Scotland, Russia, and its native Greece -- and so a good choice if you have roots in those countries. A fisherman who was the first chosen of Christ’s apostles, Andrew’s symbol is an x-shaped cross. Long a Top 10 name now slipped to Number 18, Andrew is closely identified with artists Wyeth and Warhol. Andy and Drew are the friendly short forms.DavidThe biblical David is an inspirational role model as both the boy who slew the giant Goliath with his slingshot and the fair and righteous king who was a poet and loved music. The Star of David makes David a special name in Judaism. A perennially popular boys’ name around the world, David now stands at Number 19 on the U.S. charts.

In a Democratic Year, Why are the Republicans Still Favored to Maintain Control of the Senate?	Politics News
Share
Print
Comments
Polls have consistently shown that two-thirds of the American people think the United States is going in the wrong direction. Because the Republicans, controlling as they do the Presidency and both houses of Congress, have completely determined this direction, it is not surprising that a significant majority would like to kick the Republicans out of office. Yet the battle for the Senate could go either way, and the Democrats will have to win almost every toss-up state to take control. As world democracies go, this is not normal.
By international standards, the composition of the U.S. Senate is inherently undemocratic because each state has two senators regardless of size. Wyoming, population 500,000--two senators; California, population 36,000,000--two senators. Because one-third of the senators are elected every two years, the extent to which any given Senate represents fairly the U.S. population can be determined by adding the votes for three successive elections. For example, the 100 members of the current Senate were all elected in 2000, 2002 or 2004. The Democratic candidates for the current Senate tallied more than 100 million votes, whereas the Republican candidates gained only 97 million votes. Yet it is the Republicans who have an eleven-seat advantage. In 2004 alone, the Democratic Senatorial candidates outpolled their Republican counterparts by 4.8 million votes, yet the Republicans won 19 seats to only 15 for the Democrats.
Although it is the Republicans who are currently taking advantage of our distorted system for choosing the Senate, there have been periods when they were the victims. Once again using the results of the elections for each Senate seat, after both the 1950 and 1954 elections, the Democrats controlled the Senate despite the fact that more Americans had voted for Republican candidates. For the next 42 years, Democratic Senatorial candidates outpolled their Republican opponents. However, during the 1980s, the Republicans seized control of the Senate anyway. After the elections of 1980, 1982 and 1984, the Democratic candidates for the 100 Senate seats outpolled the Republicans by 6-8%. Yet throughout this period it was the Republicans who held Senate majorities of 6 to 8 seats.
Remember the 1994 election when the Republican Party swept into power? It did so despite earning less votes for the 100 Senate seats than did the Democrats. The Republicans inched ahead in the cumulative vote totals after the 1996 and 1998 elections, but in 2000, the Republicans retained control of the Senate despite being outvoted.
This year, if the Republicans are able to hold on to 50 seats and maintain control of the Senate, we will once again be in a position where a party exercises power despite being rejected by the majority of American voters. NOTE: In preparing the statistical charts that formed the background for this piece, I examined the composition of each Senate going back to 1946. In doing so, I stumbled upon an unexpected fact. Again using the combined totals for all 100 seats, I discovered that not once has the Republican Party earned the votes of a majority of American voters, whereas the Democrats have managed to earn a majority of votes more than half the time. Yet the Republicans have controlled the Senate for 22 of the last 60 years anyway. One of the reasons for this anomaly is that 4-5% of voters choose third-party or independent candidates. However, it does illustrate the ongoing strategic challenge the Republicans face in keeping power even though they are never able to gain the sustained support of a majority of the American population.

How Do You Know When President Obama Is Lying? MSNBC Won't Tell You
Jeff Cohen
Author and media critic
With Obama in power, a number of MSNBC talking heads have reacted to the Snowden disclosures like Fox News hosts did when they were in hysterical damage control mode for Bush -- complete with ridiculously fact-free claims and national chauvinism that we've long come to expect from the "fair & balanced" channel.

Washington Watch: Week 20 - "The Stall"
Linnie Frank Bailey
So-Cal based writer; Our-Gov.com
Will GOP delaying tactics torpedo Immigration Reform? Will student loan interest rates be allowed to double? Will the 'stall' last until the 2014 mid-...
Comments Hispanics and Television News Media: Standing on the Outside Looking In
Gretchen Sierra-Zorita
Project Director, Media Diversity Initiatives for the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts
On primetime, Latinos have no Al Sharpton, no Joy Reid, no Donna Brazile, no Eugene Robinson, no Oprah Winfrey. Even though Latinos are 50 million strong and clearly decided the 2012 election, they are largely absent from the production, writing and telling of their stories.
Comments MSNBC: 'All In' or 'All Over'?
Olivia Nuzzi
Freelance writer and student
As in polling, you can get television numbers to tell you anything you want to hear. But even in that context, when ratings changes are as profound as MSNBC's, they tell a story that can be relied upon in terms of direction if not always in terms of exact degree.

Time to Abolish Left vs. Right
Carl Gibson
Co-Founder of US Uncut
If we're going to fight a binary struggle, it should be populist versus corporatist. That's the only real division in this country right now. Are you on the people's side, or on big money's side?

Comfort With Discomfort
Dylan Ratigan
New York Times Best-Selling author, entrepreneur and formerly the host of MSNBC's The Dylan Ratigan Show
On my trip across the country last summer -- having fled the news desk for a life of promoting kale, veterans, and kale-growing veterans -- I carried what I fervently believe to be a very important book, Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Antifragile.

We're All Journalists Now
Janet Ritz
Publisher, the-environmentalist.org
In the Internet age, we're all journalists. Everyone who posts on social media should consider that, if what they posted is incorrect, exposing, sensational, prejudicial or otherwise inappropriate, it may change the perception of those who see it in unforeseen ways.
Comments 'Give the People What They Want, and They'll Turn Out for It!'
Reese Schonfeld
Television journalist
hanks to the Jodi Arias trial, Headline News (HLN), which is covering the trial live almost all day long, had one of the best week's in its history. It attracted more viewers last week than either CNN or MSNBC.

Tragedy, Bigotry, and Hope
Alex Palombo
Online Strategist, Democracy Partners
The simple fact is, we don't know who did this, and speculating if Islamic terrorists did this is not only untrue, but hurtful to the Muslim community and any progress in religious tolerance we've made since September 11th.

The Elephant in the Room: Militarism
Jeff Cohen
Author and media critic
I spent years as a political pundit on mainstream TV -- at CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. I was outnumbered, outshouted, red-baited and finally terminated. Inside mainstream media, I saw that major issues were not only dodged, but sometimes not even acknowledged to exist. Today there's an elephant in the room: a huge, yet ignored, issue that largely explains why Social Security is now on the chopping block. And why other industrialized countries have free college education and universal healthcare, but we don't. It's arguably our country's biggest problem -- a problem that Martin Luther King Jr. focused on before he was assassinated 45 years ago, and has only worsened since then (which was the height of the Vietnam War). That problem is U.S. militarism and perpetual war.

Racial Maddow vs. the Islamic Republic of Iran
Shirin Sadeghi
Independent TV & Radio Host, ex-BBC & Al Jazeera
Rachel Maddow allowed herself to make embarrassingly simplistic and unknowingly complimentary remarks last night about a government she has positioned herself against because that's the thing to do these days: the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Are We Trying to Fill Souls With Soles?
Sabrina Lamb
Media Commentator, Author, CEO, WorldofMoney.org
Money was always mysterious to me. As a child, the subject of money was only reserved for 'grown folks.' I knew that my father, a career officer in the United States Army, left home every day for some place called work. Still, I never knew how money was earned or how it affected my life.
Comments 10 Years After Iraq, Media Is Still Clueless
Ben Cohen
Editor, The Daily Banter.com
It wasn't that the media 'got it wrong.' It was the the media itself that was wrong. The entire decrepit system, built on profit and ratings rather than ethics and accountability, proved to be a gigantic failure when it came to anything vaguely serious.
Comments O'Donnell Thinks Krugman Is 'A Lonely Voice Opposing Austerity' Because He Listens to MSNBC
William K. Black
It is very harmful to the nation that MSNBC has led people to believe that there is only one, presumably hopelessly weird, economist in the world who opposes austerity as a response to the Great Recession.

Elephants -- Two Things Worth Watching
Carl Safina
Author and host, 'Saving the Ocean' on PBS
Now, shrunk from perhaps 90 percent of their former range by sprawling human populations and suffering relentless killing, elephant numbers are down to well under half a million -- a drop of 98 percent since just 1800.
