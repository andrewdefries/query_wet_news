"Castle" name-drops "Firefly" in sci-fi convention episode.
Nathan Fillion is keeping the "Firefly" torch burning even in his new(er) role -- this week's "Castle" paid homage to the short-lived Joss Whedon series in a number of geeky ways. The episode, directed by "Star Trek: The Next Generation" legend Jonathan Frakes, was set at a sci-fi convention, and featured a "Firefly"-style show called "Nebula-9."
“They were canceled over a decade ago. After 12 episodes, which was 12 episodes too many," Castle explained to Beckett. “I thought you would be a fan," she admitted.
“I’m a fan of good sci-fi. ‘Star Trek,’ ‘Battlestar,’ that Joss Whedon show, but ‘Nebula-9?’ No, it’s all phony melodrama and lifeless acting," our hero proclaimed, much to the joy of the Browncoats in the audience. "Castle" airs every Monday at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.
TV Replay scours the vast television landscape to find the most interesting, amusing, and, on a good day, amazing moments, and delivers them right to your browser.

The Justice League, "The Big Bang Theory""The Big Bang Theory" is the ultimate Comic-Con lover's show, but nothing beats the gang dressed as the Justice League, beating out a sea of Justice Leagues in their New Year's costume party contest.Troy & Abed on Halloween, "Community"Right before <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&NR=1&v=IXYUn5BOgHA" target="_hplink">Greendale's zombie outbreak</a> in Season 2's big Halloween episode, Troy and Abed tried out their geektastic costumes, which weren't such a huge hit with the ladies. It wasn't long before Troy was shirtless with just a "Dracula" toilet seat cover around his neck."Modern Family" Does HalloweenThe Pritchett-Dunphy clan doesn't mess around when it comes to Halloween. Phil and Claire's house was totally decked out and costumes ranged from sexy witch, gargoyle (<em>that's</em> what Gloria was saying!), zombie bride and groom, and Dr. Frankenstein and his monster, to, of course, a slutty Mother Teresa. Bones as Wonder Woman, "Bones"To see Temperance Brennan dressed as Wonder Woman was every nerd's dream come true, but to hear her praise for costar David Boreanaz, who dressed as a nerd for the episode? Priceless. "I love nerds -- he's never been more attractive to me."Bill as the Bionic Woman, "Freaks & Geeks"While the older freaks were out smashing pumpkins and knocking down mailboxes, the younger geeks were still trying to trick-or-treat with some sweet costumes. Our personal favorite of the bunch? Bill, dressed in drag as the Bionic Woman.Seth Cohen as Spiderman, "The O.C."Thought that the "Spiderman" upside-down-in-the-rain kiss was really steamy? Always dreamed of recreating it? Seth Cohen did (albeit on accident) with his love Summer in this iconic "O.C." moment.Castle's "Firefly" flashback, "Castle"He wasn't a Browncoat exactly, but Castle's "space cowboy" costume made him look a lot like his old "Firefly" character Mal. Sarah as Princess Leia, "Chuck"This is why Con-goers will always have a special place in their hearts for "Chuck." Not only was Chuck the ultimate Nerd Herd hero, but his leading lady looked great fighting crime, selling yogurt and hot dogs or dressed in "Star Wars" costumes.Halloween vampire & werewolf scary stories, "Community"Do you like scary stories? The "Community" gang sure does, although some were scarier than others. Annie's started out romantic, then quickly turned into vampire/werewolf awesomeness. Grab the other two parts of your love triangle and go to town!Summer as Wonder Woman, "The O.C."Summer's striptease down to her Wonder Woman costume for Seth, golden lasso included, didn't even need the sexy "Santa Baby" soundtrack. Seriously. It's just as good without any sound, which is why it's another classic "O.C" moment.Super Mario & The Princess, "Family Guy"So these aren't exactly main characters on "Family Guy," but we loved their Super Mario cutaway, featuring a pissed off princess and a rambling Mario with a heavy Italian accent. Optional accessories: bring your own mushrooms, turtle shells and gold stars.Liz Lemon as Princess Leia, "30 Rock"In an attempt to get out of jury duty, Liz dressed as Princess Leia ... unfortunately, she fit right in with the rest of the crazies called in to do their civic responsibilities in New York City.Erica Durance as Wonder Woman, "Harry's Law""Smallville's" former Lois Lane Erica Durance made headlines for her guest starring role on NBC's ill-fated "Harry's Law" last season, all because she was donning her own superhero garb.Dwight Schrute as a Sith Lord, "The Office"Would you pay $129 for a Sith lightsaber? If so, you're in good company with Dwight Schrute. Darryl as Dracula & Meredith as Sookie, "The Office""The Office" knows how to do Halloween. Need more proof? Check out Darryl as Dracula (2:33 mark) and Meredith as "True Blood's" Sookie Stackhouse (3:43 mark), complete with a fake blonde wig and Merlotte's waitress uniform. Barney's Stormtrooper, "How I Met Your Mother"There's always a horde of Stormtroopers at the Con, but you can be the only one who's actually Barney's collectors' edition prop Stormtrooper from "How I Met Your Mother."Fez as Batman, "That '70s Show"Don't mess with Fez! Batman might be a crime-fighter, but this foreign exchange student has no problem fighting <em>or </em>committing crimes in the name of good trick-or-treat candy.Phoebe as Supergirl and Monica as Catwoman, "Friends"In "The One With the Halloween Party," Chandler was a giant pink bunny, Joey was Chandler and Ross was "Spud-nik" (of course), but it was the ladies who really brought the awesome: Check out Phoebe as Supergirl and Monica as a sexy Catwoman.
