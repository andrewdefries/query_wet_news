Red Sox: 2013 World Series Champions [Infographic]
Jonathan Long
President and CEO, Market Domination Media
The Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in 6 games to win the 2013 World Series. This marks the first time that the Red Sox have clinched a World Series title at Fenway Park since 1918, and it is also the third world championship for the team in the past 10 years.
Comments On the Culture Front: Celebrity Charades, Arguendo, All the Way, Eric Bogosian and more
Chris Kompanek
Freelance cultural writer
Cranston, just off of Breaking Bad relishes the duality of character. While there aren't many connections to draw between Walter White and Lyndon Johnson, both are tenacious in their pursuit of creating a meth empire and a more just society respectively.

Comments Becoming Mushy as Your Team Wins the World Series
Charles Redfern
"New Evangelical" writer; minister in conflict transformation and organizational healing
A vague mood crept over me as I watched this year's fall classic, the one in which David Ortiz flew in the sky like a bird or a plane with a cape on his back. I slowly sank into schmaltz and became the world's corniest sap. I was homesick. For Boston, of all places.
Comments Far From Cursed, Red Sox Fans are Spoiled These Days
Justin Cox
@CoxJustin & justincox22.tumblr.com
To any Bostonian who still claims that impending-doom-is-upon us personality, it's time to bequeath it to the poor people of Chicago and Cleveland. In the grand scheme, the Red Sox are a bona fide winner now, in the company of the Yankees and Cardinals of recent years.
Comments Not Only MVP -- Big Papi Deserves the Red Sox C
Luis A. Marentes
Associate professor of Spanish, University of Massachusetts Amherst
These numbers in themselves are a sufficient argument to justify granting the Dominican slugger the series' MVP. But baseball is not an individual sport, it is a team effort, and the only Red Sox veteran of the 2004 World Series champions has taken on a crucial leadership role.

There's no place like Boston in autumn. Sure, the Red Sox are in the World Series (yay!), but even when they're not, this city and its neighboring communities play host to foliage, football, spooky Halloween traditions, and outdoor activities like no other.
Comments Review: Fiona Apple's Anything We Want Is Everything We Do
Chris Sosa

Eccentric vegan songstress Fiona Apple is currently touring with a unique concept show titled 'Anything We Want,' a delightfully bizarre and intimate stage show that, despite a consistent setlist, feels refreshingly spontaneous.

Comments Looking Back and Moving Forward: Six Months After the Boston Marathon Bombings
Michelle Higginson
Marketing and communications pro
We Bostonians are a feisty and resilient bunch, and the marathon attacks do nothing to discount that. It is one thing to dampen the human spirit, but the sorry soul that thinks they can bring down a community jacked up on Dunkin' Donuts and Sam Adams has got another thing coming.

The crisis of journalism is a classic, slow-motion Black Swan imbroglio. Nearly every news organization saw the crisis coming, but hardly any proved to be capable of mounting an effective response. The story is already stale and yet it continues to remain intractable, organizationally and professionally, for most media organizations. The old way -- paid advertising, paid subscriptions, limited competition -- has collapsed and media companies are scrambling desperately to reach the other side of the chasm before they are buried forever in debris.
The "other side" holds the promise of a "new direction", driven by data, metrics, graphics, social media, rich media, sponsored events, text advertising, and ... what? Everyone sees the parts but no one yet grasps the whole. And so even if they manage to leap the divide, they cannot gain their bearings and gauge magnetic north, and they wander hither and yon.
For an example, consider the rebranding efforts of established Washington, DC political publications such as the National Journal, which now closely resembles Politico, with short-form video, blogs, opinion essays, lists, polls, requests for followers on Facebook and Twitter, and mobile apps.
The National Journal website looks great. However, the visible beauty of the new media cannot sustain itself on social blips, hyperlocal news coverage, blog aggregation, and short-form reporting. The enormous magnitude of the information landscape limits vastly the capacity of any landform on that landscape to capture the shifting spotlights of individual (or collective) attention for more than a fraction of a moment.
An Answer Under Our Feet
Here is a different view of the matter, with an approach the media industry can use to find its footing and regain its bearings. The answer is under our feet. The journalistic "whole" in the 21st century will be about controlling and having access to the "stack". The stack refers to the horizontal slices of the process that takes vast amounts of raw information and transforms it into useful material for telling interesting and important stories.
I want to be clear here that I am not really talking about social media. It is certainly true that the top layer of the stack -- the social interfaces and rich media -- is the sexier, more alluring part of the stack (the rack of the stack, as it were). And that top layer is where many companies are focusing their attention, with every effort to grab attention, go viral, and grab clicks and eyeballs. However, consider the National Journal and Politico examples. If everyone claims the top layer of the stack -- and it is not difficult to start a blog or create a Facebook page -- no one has any true claim. The most successful media companies will control the stack at deeper levels. They will control the content.
Let's burrow underground, to the bottom of the stack, away from the light, and pay attention to what is real. The media fuel of the 21st century is data. It is as valuable as coal in the 19th century and oil in the 20th century. Any company that manages, shapes, and disseminates the data -- on any subject or in any domain -- can power, drive, and direct the media economy.
Bloomberg's Giant Fear Machine
The DC political journalism establishment quakes palpably at the looming emergence of Bloomberg Government. Earlier this year, Bloomberg appointed Kevin Sheekey, former Deputy Mayor of New York under Mayor Bloomberg, to oversee the development of Bloomberg Government. At that time, the press release announcing this appointment stated:
Kevin will oversee a service that applies Bloomberg's unmatched capabilities in data gathering and analytics to a one-stop, integrated information source of government information. Bloomberg is ideally positioned to address the fragmented market for information about people, decisions and data in Washington that affect business.
The key term in this statement is "integration", which drives the government data opportunity - the development of a news and data product that presents a unified, single view of federal government information.
Bloomberg understands the importance of the data stack, and of data integration -- but only to a point. Bloomberg's own instincts -- reminiscent of Apple's - to tightly control the user experience mean that we can probably expect Bloomberg Government to offer bland short-form story-telling and pre-packaged analytics. Moreover, in its business focus, Bloomberg Government appears to tilt sharply toward the lobbying and contracting markets.
For reasons I will outline below, the Bloomberg Government approach may target the wrong markets and miss the opportunity that control of the stack presents from the perspective of data integration. This not only leaves an opening for its traditional news competitors inside the Beltway -- who have long served the lobbying and contracting markets and know them well. It also leaves an opening for any data-driven business that properly identifies the federal government data integration opportunity.
The Beltway -- Considered Philosophically
Let's elevate our view above the markets and imagine the federal government information landscape philosophically, as part of the republican fabric of our nation's Constitution. The integration of government data benefits from the realization that the "Belt" wending its "way" around Washington is substantive law, which is the glue, the common language, between the government inside the Beltway and the business heartland outside the Beltway.
Because the lobbying and contracting opportunities are so large, Bloomberg (and other DC media companies) may not fully realize the importance of this legal and compliance prism for interpreting and translating what happens in government in terms that are meaningful for both businesses and citizens.
Consider the following.
The Beltway encircles Washington, DC.
The Beltway is a wall separating government from businesses and citizens.
Laws and rules and court opinions flow across the wall, from the federal government to the heartland.
Disclosure information (filings, forms, comments, replies), flows across the wall in the opposite direction, from businesses and individuals in the heartland to the government.
Any company that commands the heights of this wall - managing and organizing and making transparent this flow of information back and forth from government to heartland - can dictate the shape and direction of journalistic storytelling and analysis in the 21st century.
This exciting project allows the company bestriding the top of this wall to serve any number of noble goals and purposes. Transform communication. Elevate understanding. Improve decision-making. Strengthen compliance. Limit risk. Save time. Increase efficiency. Spur innovation. Create opportunity. Inspire story-telling. And support the information foundations of democracy.
Journalism and Law
From the perspective of substantive law, the rivers of government data flowing in both directions across the DC Beltway provide a significant integration opportunity from which journalism can only benefit. The online data business needs a pivot for meaningful journalistic storytelling. Because almost nothing remains untouched by the lawmaking, rulemaking, and casemaking of the federal government, substantive law provides a wonderful pivot for organizing and integrating all of the data that sluices forth from these activities.
The significance of this pivot becomes particularly evident when one considers the broadened scope of federal lawmaking and rulemaking in the past 75 years. The Glass-Steagall Banking Act of 1933 totaled 37 pages. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act totaled 2,323 pages. In 1959, the Federal Register totaled 11,116 pages. In 2004, it totaled 75,657 pages. Implementation of Dodd-Frank alone will require 243 rulemaking actions and 67 studies! Any business that gains the ability to harvest, index, parse, and classify the river of data flowing in both directions across the Beltway -- lawmaking and rulemaking and casemaking flowing out and legal and business disclosure flowing in -- will be uniquely positioned to source and frame the way business, legal, policy, and political information is consumed and delivered.
The future of journalism and publishing lies at the bottom of the stack.
