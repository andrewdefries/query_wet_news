Chris Rock was on Leno last night and couldn't get over all the changes that've been made to 'The Tonight Show." The most shocking was the lack of a certain red-haired man. Leno laughed it off, but Rock wouldn't let it go. Even talk of Justin Bieber couldn't derail him from saying "I can't believe you're back. You're a bad man, Jay Leno." WATCH: FOLLOW HUFFPOST COMEDY

Anthony Bologna, NYPD Cop Who Pepper-Sprayed Occupy Protesters, Will Get No Help From City In Lawsuit

New York News
Anthony Bologna-- the NYPD Deputy Inspector caught on video pepper-spraying two women Occupy Wall Street protesters in Union Square last fall-- could have to dig into his own pockets to pay for the damages in the women's civil lawsuit against him. New York City has opted not to defend Bologna in court, The Wall Street Journal reports.
The decision indicates the city finds the 29-year NYPD veteran's defense of his actions inadequate, and is a stark contrast from NYPD spokesman Paul Browne's initial remarks on the incident in September. As ProPublica's Justin Elliot remembers, Browne defended Bologna when video of the pepper-spraying incident started to go viral, saying cops that day used the spray "appropriately."
"Pepper spray was used once,” he said, “after individuals confronted officers and tried to prevent them from deploying a mesh barrier — something that was edited out or otherwise not captured in the video.”
It appears the city now thinks differently.
Bologna's attorney disagrees with the decision. "He wasn't doing this as Anthony Bologna, mister," Louis La Pietra told The Journal, in hopes the city will come to his client's aid. "He was doing this as Anthony Bologna, deputy inspector, NYPD."
A police union will help pay for Bologna's defense. After the pepper-spray incident, Bologna was docked 10 vacation days and transferred to Staten Island. The city Law Department tells The Journal there are currently 1,376 pending federal civil-rights cases against the NYPD. An official estimated that in less than five percent of such cases does the city decline to defend cops. News of Bologna's troubles comes a week after a scathing report on NYPD police abuses during Occupy protests. After an eight month investigation by attorneys from Harvard, Stanford and Rutgers, as part of the Protest and Assembly Rights Project, the group determined that the NYPD used unnecessarily aggressive tactics, excessive force, and illegally suppressed press freedoms during Occupy demonstrations. The group called on Mayor Bloomberg to launch an independent inquiry into the police abuses. Earlier on HuffPost:	Loading Slideshow
Occupy Wall Street: NYPD raid on camp in Zuccotti parkPolice have begun clearing out 'Occupy' protester camps in New York. There are also claims that pepper spray is being used. The raid comes after activists vowed heightened action this coming Thursday, to mark two months since the movement began. RT's Marina Portnaya reports from New York.

Above is footage he shot as the protesters marched through the street of Manhattan and had various stand-offs with the New York Police Department. Tracey himself reports being punched in the shoulder while filming. In the above video, around the 1.40 mark, a white-shirted NYPD officer decks a protester in a green shirt (how the incident started is unclear).

(AP Photo/Andrew Burton)A protestor is arrested by a police officer while participating in the Occupy Wall Street protests Friday, Oct. 14, 2011, in New York. At least ten people were arrested during the march, which began after protestors heard the news that the owners of Zuccotti Park had withdrawn their request to have the park cleaned by the New York Police Department. (AP Photo/Andrew Burton)Sanitation workers gather at Zuccotti Park, the longtime Occupy Wall Street encampment in New York, to start the cleanup effort early Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2011. At about 1 a.m. Tuesday, police handed out notices from the park's owner, Brookfield Office Properties, and the city saying that the park had to be cleared because it had become unsanitary and hazardous. Protesters were told they could return, but without sleeping bags, tarps or tents.

"Say...they told me you were stupid. You don't sound stupid to me." -Mr. Esmond
"I can be smart when I want to." -Lorelei Lee in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"
"Whether it's Kim Kardashian or Paris Hilton or whoever, stupidity is certainly celebrated."
Thus Jon Hamm, talking celebrity culture with Elle UK, started a verbal skirmish with Kim Kardashian that has everyone from TMZ to the Wall Street Journal talking. Hamm went on: "Being a f**king idiot is a valuable commodity in this culture because you're rewarded significantly. Incuriousness has become cool ... It's celebrated. It doesn't make sense to me."
Kardashian took to Twitter to respond to Hamm's remarks:
I just heard about the comment Jon Hamm made about me in an interview. I respect Jon and I am a firm believer that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and that not everyone takes the same path in life. We're all working hard and we all have to respect one another. Calling someone who runs their own businesses, is a part of a successful TV show, produces, writes, designs, and creates, "stupid," is in my opinion careless.
Hamm's remarks don't seem very careless -- they actually seem pretty thoughtful -- and he didn't say Kardashian isn't successful. Her $35 million net worth and household name status would make that a very difficult claim to defend. The problem with Hamm's comments is that the examples he provides of so-called stupidity are both women. For one thing, there are plenty of men who would fit his definition of stupid -- see The Situation or "The Flavor of Love's" Flavor Flav. Hamm also named two women extremely shrewd at building their own brands, and as such descendants of a long line of women in entertainment who have made a mint on the ditziness they projected to the world. The success of the film "My Week with Marilyn" and the TV show "Smash" prove that we're still fascinated by Marilyn Monroe's public persona, a mix of sexuality and immaturity that earned her the adoration of men and the scorn of feminists. Like Jean Harlow before her and Jayne Mansfield after, audiences are still clamoring for a slightly vapid-sounding "blonde bombshell" (though today, I'd argue the hair color and gender are negotiable). Hilton and Kardashian are very aware of the image they present to fans. They're wise to the exact "stupidity" Hamm criticizes, and the public's appetite for it, and milking both for all they're worth.
Quick Poll
Whose side are you on: Jon Hamm's or Kim Kardashian's?
Hamm’s: Hollywood needs to raise its standards.
Kardashian’s: She’s laughing all the way to the bank.
Tie: Stupidity isn’t limited to Hollywood women, but Kardashian isn’t doing herself any favors with her public image.
Neither: I could care less.
