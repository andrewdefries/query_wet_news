With the real possibility that a handful of lawmakers -- or even a single vote -- in the House of Representatives could end up deciding the fate of health care reform, advocates are suddenly targeting the chamber's most progressive holdout. Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio.) has firmly staked out his opposition to health care reform's passage, citing the timidity of the legislative language and, specifically, the unwillingness of lawmakers to seriously consider a single payer system. For months, leadership had assumed his position was unalterable. But with an "all hands on deck" whip operation now in progress, Kucinich is getting a burst of attention.
In a meeting at the White House on Thursday, President Obama directly addressed the congressman's concerns by pointing out that the Senate bill does, in fact, include single-payer language. His reference (which Kucinich wrote down on paper) is a provision in the bill that Sen. Bernie Sander (I-VT) introduced, which would allow states to use federal money to set up a single payer system years down the road. On Monday, Sanders told the Huffington Post that he had talked to Kucinich about the topic - albeit "a while back." "He was coming from a slightly different angle on this," Sanders said. "But we did talk to Dennis and I've talked to [Rep.] Anthony Weiner and other" single-payer advocates. Sanders said his provision is a significant step towards making the bill more to Kucinich's liking, but he didn't sound optimistic that either his personal lobbying or his legislative language would persuade Kucinich in the end. "Dennis looks at the world the way he looks at the world," Sanders said. Under Sanders's proposal, states would have the option of using the federal funding they receive for health care services (including the new subsidies in the bill) on policies for providing universal care. There are certain restrictions. For starters, a state could only use 90 percent of the federal funds it received, and it could only spend that money on a universal system starting in 2017 - both stipulations of the Congressional Budget Office. Sanders is still working on a reconciliation fix to move the start date forward three years (perhaps by allowing blocs of states to start before others) in addition to increasing the funding threshold. But the goal, he stressed, remains providing a foundation for single-payer to grow in practice and popularity. "One state is finally going to do it, they are going to do it well, and it will catch on," he said. Kucinich didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The congressman has previously insisted that the law allowing insurance companies to sue states that adopt single-payer systems must be changed. And on this front, Sanders admits, his provision has a "weakness."
Still, in the days ahead the pitch will be made to the congressman and other skeptical progressives that this bill is far from conservative. On Sunday, Chris Bower at OpenLeft put out a nine-point list of concessions that liberal lawmakers were able to secure from the party's more centrist members. Sanders, likewise, pointed to the money going to prevention and wellness initiatives, as well as the expansion of coverage through community health care centers, as uniquely important progressive achievements. "Look, I'm not here to tell you this is a great bill," the senator said. "What I will tell you is we fought very hard for some things that don't get a lot of attention but are very important."

Politics News
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court announced Tuesday that it will hear a case challenging the per-biennial cycle limit on campaign contributions from individuals.
The case, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, argues that the limit on what individuals are allowed to give candidates ($46,200 per two-year cycle) and parties and PACs ($70,800 per two-year cycle) is an unconstitutional violation of the individual donor's free speech rights.
The U.S. Court of Appeals already ruled in favor of keeping the biennial limits, which have been in place since 1971 and were upheld in the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo case. By accepting the case, the Supreme Court is stepping into the thick of another controversial campaign finance case just three years after ruling in Citizens United v. FEC that corporations and unions can spend freely on elections.
If the court rules against the two-year limits, it would mark the first time a court has overturned a part of the landmark Buckley ruling that deals with campaign contribution limits. This is not terribly surprising as the court has been hostile to campaign finance laws ever since Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a supporter of campaign finance regulation, was replaced by Justice Samuel Alito, a member of the court's conservative bloc who is opposed to campaign regulation.
Campaign finance reformers are already calling on the court to maintain the Buckley precedent and rule against the challenge in McCutcheon, for fear that any overturning of Buckley will eventually lead to future erosion of contribution limits and other campaign finance precedents meant to protect against corruption or the appearance of corruption.
"If the Supreme Court reverses its past ruling in Buckley, the Court would do extraordinary damage to the nation’s ability to prevent the corruption of federal officeholders and government decisions," Democracy 21 president Fred Wertheimer said in a statement. "It would also represent the first time in history that the Court declared a federal contribution limit unconstitutional."
"In agreeing to hear the McCutcheon case, the Supreme Court has an opportunity to defend common sense limits on how much influence wealthy special interests can buy in Washington," Nick Nyhart, president and CEO of Public Campaign, said in a statement. "In recent decisions, the Court has too often sided with big donors and against our democracy. It's time for the Court to stand up for the voices of everyday people and uphold the limits."
A ruling to overturn the biennial limits would not directly affect the amount an individual donor could give to a single candidate, but, thanks to the proliferation of joint fundraising committees, known as victory funds or committees, a candidate could potentially solicit a single contribution from one donor of up to -- if not more than -- $3,627,600.
This could work if, say, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) or President Barack Obama expanded their respective victory fund to distribute donations to all 435 House candidates and all 33 Senate candidates ($2,433,600 per two-year cycle), each federal party committee ($97,200 per year) and all 50 state party committees ($500,000 per year).
The expanded victory fund case presents to most obvious way that a ruling in favor of repealing the limits could immediately affect campaign fundraising. Still, the greater worry is how a ruling against limits could affect future cases.
University of California, Irvine law professor Rick Hasen wrote for Election Law Blog that the case has broader implications. "Striking part of the Buckley edifice could mean that more will fall," Hasen wrote, "and that the Court’s general skepticism toward the constitutionality of limits already in play in the independent spending area could spread to contribution limits."
