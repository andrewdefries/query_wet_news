HBO will be debuting “The Latino List,” a new documentary featuring a series of “highly personal video portraits of Latinos who have richly contributed to the fabric of contemporary society.” The debut on September 28th honors Hispanic Heritage Month. The film explores what it means to be a Latino in the United States in 2011. Directing the film is Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, acclaimed photographer and director of the three editions of HBO’s “The Black List.” HBO says the film adds a “brand-new chapter to its oral-history book with this exclusive profile of 15 power players” as said to HuffPost Latino Voices. The intimate interviews were with award-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, anchor of NPR's Latino USA.
“The Latino List is an extension of my previous films, which all deal with identity, struggle and achievement,” said Greenfield-Sanders. The subjects discussed what inspired them growing up, why they chose certain professions, how they overcame challenges, and the importance of preserving their Latino culture.
The Latino Lists’ interviewees “represent a diverse cross-section of disciplines” from politics, theater, science, music, business, government and journalism in the Latino community. Among them are:
“Acclaimed writer Sandra Cisneros; Grammy®-winning singer Gloria Estefan; Golden Globe-winning actress America (Ugly Betty) Ferrera; NASA astronaut Jose Moreno Hernandez; military veteran Consuelo Castillo Kickbusch; actor/writer/producer John Leguizamo; actress Eva Longoria (Desperate Housewives); U.S. Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ); rapper Pitbull; PGA golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez; ACLU Exec. Director Anthony D. Romero; radio host Eddie “Piolin” Sotelo; U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor; financial advisor Julie Stav; and scholar Dr. Marta Moreno Vega.”
“We wanted famous names, of course, but also stories from people whom you might not know about,” said Greenfield-Sanders. “I’m very proud of the film and think it has a great emotional resonance.”
The Latino List debuts Wednesday, September 28th at 9pm on HBO Latino and Thursday, September 29th at 8pm on HBO in celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month. The film will air in both English and Spanish on HBO.

Not this year. Despite heavy anticipation that horse racing would have its first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978, I'll Have Another is not running the Belmont Stakes on Saturday. During an interview on the "Dan Patrick Show" on Friday, trainer Doug O'Neill broke the news. @dpshow
Dan Patrick Show
Doug O'Neill: "I'll Have Another is officially out of the Belmont."
June 8, 2012 3:24 pm via web Reply
Retweet
Favorite
The three-year-old colt owned by Reddam Racing and trained by O'Neill notched thrilling wins at the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and was the early favorite at the Belmont Stakes. The surprise scratch is the result of an injury, with O'Neill telling the Dan Patrick Show that the horse "has the start of some tendonitis in the left front leg.” O'Neill went on to reveal that he doesn't expect the horse to race again. "The horse is sound and happy, but it's not worth it," O'Neill would later tell The Associated Press.
The New York Racing Association quickly scheduled a press conference for 1 p.m. on Friday. During the press conference held at Belmont Park, it was announced that I'll Have Another is retired from racing. Very early on Friday morning, O'Neill had worked out I'll Have Another, getting the chestnut colt out on the track at Belmont at 5:30 a.m., according to the New York Daily News. "He is fit and ready to go and we are just trying to let him bring as much energy to the table tomorrow as possible," O'Neill told the News hours before announcing the scratch during a radio appearance, later adding, "We are ready to roll."
I'll Have Another is far from the first horse to win the first two legs of the Triple Crown before failing to finish it off. The scratch for I'll Have Another marks just the third time in the history of the Triple Crown that a horse has won the first two legs but not run the Belmont. During the 1930s, Burgo King and Bold Venture captured the Derby and the Preakness but did not start the Belmont. Here are the alibis (or excuses) for some of the other notable horses that came close but never celebrated the feat. Loading Slideshow
Tim Tam (1958The Calumet Farm bay colt finished second to Cavan by 5 1/2 lengths after running the final quarter-mile with a broken bone in his right front ankle.Carry Back (1961)A scrawny, unattractive little colt was poised to make another thrilling stretch run to victory, but when jockey Johnny Sellers asked for more, Carry Back "spit the bit" - a racing term meaning he simply didn't feel like running anymore. He finished seventh behind 65-1 long shot Sherluck.Majestic Prince (1969)The great jockey Bill Hartack was criticized by many for moving too late in the stretch in losing to Arts and Letters. It was Majestic Prince's first loss in 10 starts.Spectacular Bid (1979)Considered a cinch to give racing its fourth Triple Crown winner in the 1970s, the Bid stepped on a safety pin in his stall the morning of the race. He finished third behind Coastal after young jockey Ron Franklin gunned Bid to the lead and the colt faded in the stretch.Silver Charm (1997)After reeling in rival Free House with an eighth of a mile to go, Silver Charm was on his way to immortality. But with 75 yards to go, jockey Gary Stevens saw another horse out of the corner of his eye. It was Touch Gold, and Silver Charm didn't see him either until 10 jumps from the wire. By then, it was too late.Real Quiet (1998)A year after trainer Bob Baffert had his heart broken by Silver Charm, another of his horses - Real Quiet - took a run at greatness. But jockey Kent Desormeaux was criticized for making his move too early, and by the time Real Quiet was a furlong from the finish at Belmont, he began staggering home. Victory Gallop, runner-up in the Derby and Preakness, was bearing down and the two hit the wire together. After several agonizing minutes, the photo went against Real Quiet.Charismatic (1999)Trainer D. Wayne Lukas' Triple Crown quest ended with a quarter mile to go, when Charismatic fractured two bones in his left front leg but still finished third behind 29-1 long shot Lemon Drop Kid.War Emblem (2002)Baffert has had some tough luck chasing the Triple Crown and his front-running speedster was done in early - he stumbled out of the starting gate and finished eighth behind 70-1 long shot Sarava.Smarty Jones (2004)After fighting off strong challenges from Rock Hard Ten and Eddington along the backstretch, Smarty Jones and jockey Stewart Elliott opened a 3 1/2-length lead into the stretch. But the early duels proved to be Smarty's undoing. He tired in the stretch and was caught in the final 70 yards by 36-1 long shot Birdstone.

Angus T. Jones' very public "Two and a Half Men" outburst is the talk of Hollywood this week. At Wednesday's Hollywood Radio And Television Society Newsmaker luncheon, even Fox chairman Kevin Reilly weighed in on the controversy.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Reilly compared Jones' controversial statements with "American Idol" judge Nicki Minaj's latest feud with former judge Steven Tyler. "It’s part of the world we live in,” Reilly said. "You want stars to represent themselves, but sometimes they freestyle a little bit.”
Reilly reportedly pointed out that Minaj's "Idol" antics would be "good for [the network]," since it keeps the aging reality contest in the news and generates curiosity. However, he did point out that, in the case of Jones, “There’s a point where it can get out of control. [That] is where the PR people come in and tell Angus to apologize in a statement.”
Also on the luncheon's panel was Katherine Pope, president of television for Chernin Entertainment. According to THR, her concern was with the actor's work ethic. "Are they showing up for work?" she asked. "Everybody now has an outlet to express everything at any given moment, and that may change… [But] if the work isn’t impacted, everybody has their moments, and you let it pass."

The eyes and ears of everyone from the banking centers in North Carolina and New York, to the financial centers on each coast to the oil patch to the coal fields are focused on a small group of Congress Members and Senators in Washington, DC to see what the form of the $800 billion stimulus package will finally take.
Much of the rest of the world is wondering why, amid all the talk of trade-offs and add-ons, no one in Washington appears to be the least bit concerned about the astonishing risks we continue to run by doing nothing about our dependence on foreign oil.
In January we imported more than two-thirds of all the oil we used. Nearly 408 million barrels at a cost of about $17 billion. At $40 per barrel we have fallen into the familiar trap of ignoring the amount of oil we are importing and focusing on the per-barrel price.
Just over one month ago the Russians got into an argument with one of its former Republics, Ukraine, over the price of natural gas and the cost of transporting that gas from Russia through Ukraine to the rest of Europe. According to Reuters, this "led to the most serious supply disruption in Europe for years." Reuters also pointed out that "Europe receives a fifth of all its gas" through the pipeline which was at issue.
Russia turned off the tap for 20 percent of the natural gas Europe uses and there was a huge impact economically and socially.
We are importing more than three times the percentage of oil and are at the mercy of countries, many of which, do not have our best interests at heart.
How long do you think it will be before countries like Iran, Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela take their cue from the Russians and decide to employ the oil they export to America as a political, economic and foreign policy weapon.
If you don't think Russia is such a bad role model, consider what the Washington Post's Fred Hiatt wrote over the weekend: Over the past year, Russia has invaded the sovereign state of Georgia, parts of which it continues to occupy; cut off natural gas to parts of Europe during the depth of winter; sold weapons to Iran and Venezuela; and otherwise made itself disagreeable.
During the infamous Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s, those of us old enough can remember all too well the gas lines or the "no gas" signs, the rationing based on even or odd-numbered license plates or birth dates and all the other disturbances to our lives.
In 1973 we imported about the same percentage of oil as Europe does gas -- about 24 percent. Now we are importing over 66 percent and even a minor hiccup in supply -- during this time of extreme economic unease -- can have disastrous effects.
President Obama has pledged to completely cut imports from the Middle East, Africa and Venezuela in the next ten years. That accounts for about half of the oil we import today. In addition, Mexico's oil fields are becoming depleted so quickly that in the next few years Mexico will become a net importer of oil, instead of a net exporter.
After Canada and Saudi Arabia, Mexico is our next largest supplier of imported oil. We will have to replace that supply as well.
The only way to get there is to make better use of domestic supplies. Wind and solar are on everyone's lips because they use no natural resources, they produce no emissions and they are generally built on land which either has no other use, or can be used for other things -- like cattle grazing in the Great Plains wind corridor.
Those resources will help decrease the amount of coal used to generate electricity but 70 percent of the oil we import is used as a transportation fuel. About a third of that goes into making the diesel used to drive heavy trucks moving goods on America's highways. A battery powers a car or even a light truck for a limited distance, but it cannot power an 18-wheeler.
There are about six million 18-wheelers in the U.S. fleet. If, as those fleets are renewed in the normal course of business, 350,000 trucks are built to run on liquified natural gas, instead of diesel, we would immediately reduce our need for foreign oil by over 5 percent.
America has an abundance of natural gas. The shale deposits from Texas to Louisiana to Appalachia and through the Great Lakes contain enough natural gas to meet our needs for many decades to come -- certainly long enough to replace foreign oil until battery, hydrogen or some other technology comes on line to become the primary transportation fuel for all sizes of vehicles.
America should not be at the mercy of some of the most dangerous governments in some of the most unstable areas of the planet for so much of our energy needs. We should start, immediately, to begin the process of moving America's fleets from imported gasoline or diesel to domestic natural gas.
