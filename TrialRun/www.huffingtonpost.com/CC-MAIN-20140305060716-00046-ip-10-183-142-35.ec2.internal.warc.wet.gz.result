Politics News
The Pennsylvania Democratic Senate primary fight between Sen. Arlen Specter and Rep. Joe Sestak in Pennsylvania is heating up, as both candidates released advertisements today.
Specter recently came out swinging with an ad entitled "No Show Joe":
This is Specter's fourth ad. His first three, released last week, focused on the Senator's support from unions.
Sestak's campaign responded to charges in a statement on Tuesday:
It's disappointing that after 30 years in Washington, Arlen Specter can't run on his own accomplishments. So while Joe Sestak is running a positive TV ad about his accomplishments and his agenda for changing Washington, Specter has launched a Republican-style negative campaign in his TV ads. It will speak volumes to Democrats that Joe Sestak is running on his record, while Arlen Specter runs away from his. Sestak's also went on the air recently with its own ad, "Meet Joe Sestak." Watch it:

Pop queen Lady Gaga, dressed in large sunglasses and a black veil, unveiled a new Polaroid camera at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
Lady Gaga was brought on by Polaroid to serve as Creative Director and co-design the company's Grey Label line of products.
She took the wraps off of a new digital camera (the GL30 instant digital camera), as well as two other products: Polaroid's GL20 camera glasses and a mobile printer (the GL10).
"I consider myself to be a visionary, not just a songwriter and a singer. I am an artist," said Lady Gaga in a press release. "I brought my vision and love of fashion, technology and obsession with the future into all of my work with Polaroid."
See photos of the new Polaroid camera below. Check out our full CES 2011 coverage here.

PHILADELPHIA -- A tug operator consumed by a family emergency pleaded guilty Monday to involuntary manslaughter for a fatal crash with a duck boat filled with tourists, an accident he acknowledged was caused largely by his continuous use of a cellphone and laptop computer while he was steering a barge.
Pilot Matt Devlin said he "didn't really make the best decisions" aboard the tug after learning that his 5-year-old son had suffered life-threatening complications during routine eye surgery. His distraction ultimately resulted in the barge plowing into the duck boat on the Delaware River, killing two Hungarian students.
"I wish I could take it all back ... I just wasn't thinking clearly after getting that news," Devlin said during a federal court hearing.
The remarks by Devlin, 35, of Catskill, N.Y., were his first public statements since the crash last summer involving the tug Caribbean Sea, the barge Resource and the duck boat, an amphibious tourist vehicle.
The accident occurred in Philadelphia on July 7, 2010, after the duck boat stalled in the busy shipping channel. As it sat anchored, awaiting help, the barge began bearing down and Devlin didn't respond to distress calls because he had silenced the radios to talk on the phone, authorities said.
Devlin had learned shortly before the crash that his son had been deprived of oxygen for about eight minutes during surgery. He then repeatedly made and received calls on his phone, surfed the Internet for medical information and moved to a lower wheelhouse for more privacy – putting the duck boat in his blind spot, according to a report by the National Transportation Safety Board.
"I believe that took away the best view," Devlin said Monday.
The crash sent all 37 people on the duck boat into the river, but 16-year-old Dora Schwendtner and 20-year-old Szabolcs Prem never resurfaced. The Hungarians were visiting the United States through a church exchange program; their families have filed wrongful-death lawsuits.
Devlin was charged with misconduct of a ship operator causing death, a maritime offense that authorities describe as the equivalent of involuntary manslaughter. As a condition of the plea agreement, he also surrendered his Coast Guard license. He faces 37 to 46 months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Zauzmer described the medical emergency as "a legitimate personal crisis" and called Devlin "very remorseful." Still, he said Devlin should have handled it better.
"What he needed to do, obviously, was turn over his duties to the captain of the ship and not try to deal with two things at the same time," Zauzmer said after the hearing.
Devlin's lawyer, Frank DeSimone, stressed said that his client wasn't talking "frivolously" on his cellphone. Although Devlin's son, now 6, has fully recovered, at the time Devlin thought the boy might die or suffer brain damage, DeSimone said.
"As soon as he was told about what happened to his son, he was in a fog," DeSimone said.
The attorney said Devlin has repeated nightmares about the crash. Devlin himself said in court that he's been seeing a psychiatrist, is on medication and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Devlin shared an emotional hug with his wife after the hearing. He declined to comment and was released on bond pending sentencing Nov. 1.
Georgia-based Ride the Ducks offers tours in Philadelphia; San Francisco; Branson, Mo.; Stone Mountain, Ga.; and the Cincinnati area.
The company suspended its Philadelphia tours after the accident but resumed them this spring, albeit with a shortened water route. The boats did not operate on the anniversary of the crash.

Making small, hand-held bites does not have to mean you'll spend hours in the kitchen, as these speedy yet great-looking hors d'oeuvres show.
By Lynn Andriani
A Traditional Party App, Sandwich-ified
CherylStyle.com
This recipe from entertaining expert Cheryl Najafi takes the familiar tomato, mozzarella and basil on a stick and adds a new element; but doesn't take you down a rabbit hole of prep work. The supersimple addition is just toasted mini pitas (Thomas' makes them, as does Trader Joe's); they add heft, crunch and an undeniable cuteness factor. You place a piece of tomato, mozzarella and basil in each pita and secure the micro-sandwich with a skewer.
Get the recipe: Caprese Pita Skewers
Smarter Stuffed Peppers
Con Poulos
Individual roasted, stuffed peppers look so appealing, but the thought of cleaning peppers, roasting them, removing their skins and stems and then filling each one? Not so much. This done-and-done recipe has you use jarred peppers, which are soft enough to roll up but also strong enough to hold a simple tuna salad (pick up the salad at a deli if you really want to keep things simple).
Get the recipe: Piquillo Peppers with Mediterranean Tuna Salad
Homemade Crackers Anyone Can Make (Seriously)
Thinkstock
Baked-from-scratch, cheesy crackers not only taste better than store-bought, but they smell fantastic as they're cooking, too, and look lovely on an hors d'oeuvre platter. Fear not: If you can make and slice dough to bake cookies, you can probably handle this recipe. You pulse flour, cheese, lemon peel, thyme, butter, sour cream and an egg yolk in a food processor; roll the dough into a log; chill (wrapped in plastic); cut and pop in the oven.
Get the recipe: Lemon Pepper Parmesan Crackers
Party-Ready Grilled Cheese
Lynn Andriani
There are only three ingredients in these addictive bites, but each one is a powerhouse. You start with brioche, which has enough butter in it that you don't need to spread any on it. Then comes aged cheddar (the older it is, the more sharp it tastes). After you've miniaturized these droolworthy sandwiches into individual portions with a sharp knife, you add the finishing touch: A smear of Mostarda, a sweet-savory dried-fruit compote (you could also use fig jam).
Get the recipe: Little Brioche-Aged Cheddar Grilled Cheese Sandwiches
The Mini Pizza, Perfected
Andrews McMeel Publishing
We're big fans of the fast and easy mini-bagel pizza (and we suspect we're not alone here), but the tasty party snack does have a flaw -- that hole in the middle that the cheese and sauce always drip through. Instead, here's a better way: Use a tube of prepared polenta as a solid platform on which to spread tomato sauce and grated cheese, so the pizzas look terrific but are still a snap to make.

Euro hits 7-month high vs dollar on budget hopes

versions NEW YORK — Hopes that U.S. lawmakers are closer to a budget deal pushed the euro to a seven-month high against the dollar Tuesday.
Risker currencies, such as the euro, tend to rise when traders think economic risks are receding.
The euro rose to $1.3220 late Tuesday from $1.3160 late Monday. The euro rose as high as $1.3238 earlier, its highest point against the dollar since May 2.
Traders have been worried about the U.S. "fiscal cliff," a series of tax increases and government spending cuts set to kick in at the beginning of next year unless the White House and Congress reach an agreement on reducing the budget deficit.
On Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner says he's hopeful a deal can be reached.
In other trading, the British pound rose to $1.6248 from $1.6203.
The dollar fell to 0.9136 Swiss franc from 0.9179 Swiss franc.
The dollar rose to 84.20 Japanese yen from 83.83 Japanese yen and to 98.54 Canadian cents from 98.42 Canadian cents.

"Parenthood's" mid-season finale airs Tuesday, Dec. 11 at 10 p.m. EST on NBC, and I've been meant to write about it for a while. (I'm in a perpetual state of meaning to write about "Parenthood" and not doing it.)
I'll start things off with a personal anecdote that I think illustrates what's best about the show, and I'll try to get through this part without crying. Ha. That's like trying to get through an episode of "Parenthood" -- especially this season -- with dry eyes. It just won't happen. Last March, on a ski vacation in Colorado, I was on a very large mountain, heading downhill and toward a restaurant where my husband and I planned to meet friends for lunch. I'm not a great skier, but I was doing pretty well that day ... though I was in the process of realizing I kind of just wanted to quit -- not just for the day, but maybe forever. I've never been that enthused about skiing; I do it because my husband and son love it and are great at it. People with good balance who like to go fast -- God bless you. I am not one of your kind. We were only a few hundred yards from our destination when one of my legs went one way and the other leg strongly objected and went another way altogether. A very large sound cracked across the snowy landscape. Once my body came to a stop, I looked down to see my right leg sticking out in a way I never want to see it sticking out again. I'd done a lot of bad things to my leg, we found out eventually (ACL destroyed, MCL half-destroyed, bone bruise, etc). I didn't know the specifics in the moment; I just howled like an animal. There was no shame in the howling, because agony destroys the possibility of shame. I'd compare it to the pain of childbirth, but I don't know anyone who's given birth at 8,000 feet with her face mashed into snow. Finally, my husband got my skis off my legs and I slowly rolled on to my side. In those moments in which I could speak, I told my husband that after the Ski Patrol took me away, he should pick up our son from ski school and stay on the mountain. What would be the point of both of us spending hours and hours in the emergency room? My husband isn't big on what are considered romantic gestures; most of the time, he experiences major panic when he's trying to figure out what gift to buy me and he's never really gone the roses-and-chocolates route for any holiday or birthday. But now that I've been married a dozen years, I want to tell anyone on the dating scene that they should look for someone who will hold your puke bucket after surgery and who will do a thousand little errands for you when you're cranky and unable to move. Most of all, look for someone who will immediately scoff at the suggestion of leaving you in the hands of strangers when you're at your most vulnerable. I won't repeat exactly what Dave said to me that day, but those short, declarative sentences were the most romantic things he's ever said. He stayed with me during the long, painful procedure of getting me into a litter towed by a Ski Patrol snowmobile, he followed us down the mountain, he got our son from ski school and handed him off to our friends, he followed me to the emergency room and he sat there with me for hours. He helped me get on the flight home, he showed endless patience when I had knee surgery two months later, and he covered for me in a million ways during seven months of physical therapy. I was not always at my best when I was recovering from all that. We'd like to think pain and sickness make us more noble and admirable (like Julia Roberts in one of those movies where she dies), but most often, crises of any kind just stress us out. My long knee nightmare often made me angry (how dare doctors say I couldn't work out or do everything I normally do? Wrong!). As the hard times (ideally) hone us into more patient, giving and caring people, they also put big spotlights on our flaws. And if you're family, you don't let the existence of those flaws stop you from holding someone's hand when they just can't take any more. "Parenthood" gets all that. And that's what makes us cry -- the show's constant celebration of the way people persevere and try not to give in to their least generous instincts. Sometimes these people fail, sometimes they're petty or selfish or stubborn, but it's the desire to do better that we relate to. "Parenthood" is one of the chattiest shows on TV -- the Bravermans' overlapping conversations are one of the drama's signatures -- but often the best moments involve silence: Think of Adam Braverman looking at his wife, Kristina, who has been fighting breast cancer, as she slept, or think of both their faces the first time she got chemotherapy. Recall Crosby's face as he sat in a bar, listening to a frantic Adam unload the stress and fear he's been holding in. Think of Kristina's face when she danced with her son, Max, and wondered how many more times she'd get to do that in her life. We don't remember the dialogue of "Parenthood," we remember the faces -- the patience, the sadness, the worry displayed on those knotted Braverman brows. It's impossible not to relate to those feelings of helplessness and tenderness, and often, when we're already feeling misty, Mae Whitman's Amber comes along, and with one wrinkle of her forehead, she destroys whatever defenses we had left. And that's why we endure the parts of the show that feel a whole lot less interesting than Kristina's cancer battle and her attempts to be a good mother and take care of herself for once. Though I've loved Ray Romano on the show, it's hard to care as much about Sarah's impulsivity and self-deception, though Lauren Graham's skill at tempering those qualities is undeniable. Crosby's parking dispute with one of the recording studio's neighbors was typical of "Parenthood's" laundry-folding storylines: Pamela Adlon's villainous neighbor had to veer near cartoonishness in order to tidily wrap up that story within the hour. But many of the slightly-too-slick storylines offer good moments: I may not believe that Max Braverman would have won the student council election that easily, but Haddie's coaching of her brother was a sweet and understated moment, and that storyline has been yet another instance of the show respectfully and honestly portraying the multiple facets of Max's Asperger syndrome. Since the show began, it's struggled to create consistently good stories for Sam and Julia, and even now, I have little sense of the personality of their adopted son, Victor. The show has so many characters to keep track of that not all of them are memorable and not all of them get interesting things to do. But "Parenthood" is an hourlong broadcast network drama that earnestly, and quite often effectively, takes on a whole host of things that other shows do their best avoid. Raising a kid with Asperger, dealing with the trauma of having been to war, adopting a child, battling cancer -- "Parenthood" is admirable for even trying to take on these things, and NBC is to be commended for keeping this genuine and thoughtful show on the air. Sometimes programs stay on the air long enough to allow you to admit a mistake, and I'm grateful for that too. When "Parenthood" began, I wondered if Monica Potter, who often plays high-strung characters, would be too much for me to take. Good God, the woman has slain me during every single episode this season. One of the things I've most strongly related to is the idea that it's hard to let go and be taken care of. I was so relieved Dave didn't let me go to that Colorado hospital alone, but I'm fully aware of how much I've had to rely on him and everyone else around me for nearly a year. It's humbling. Potter has shown just how hard it is for Kristina to accept how much help she needs and how awful her situation is, and both Potter and Krause have done career-best work as Adam and Kristina reaffirmed their bond during this unpredictable cancer shitstorm. If you've ever had a relative with a serious medical condition, you know how accurately the cast has portrayed the sadness, terror and heartbreaking love that are inescapable parts of those situations. Not knowing what's coming next makes everything more intense, and Krause and Potter have paid tribute to that intensity but not with showy performances; they've both been models of subtlety and truthfulness. I will admit to half-paying attention during "Parenthood's" more meandering or lightweight storylines, and I'll admit that I've often let episodes pile up on my DVR; sometimes I want an escape from, rather than a reflection of, my own life. But when I catch up with the Braverman chronicles, I end up glad I've done so: When it's firing on all cylinders, no show on television is more humane or emotionally resonant. "Parenthood" reminds us how tough it is to care about other people, and why, if we're lucky, we can't stop ourselves from doing so. My colleague Jamie Etkin recently interviewed Max Burkholder and Peter Krause; look here for those interviews later Monday and Tuesday. "Parenthood" airs 10 p.m. EST Tuesdays on NBC.
