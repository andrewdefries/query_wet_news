Politics News
The wide release of Mitt Romney's remarks about the "47 percent" of the country who the GOP presidential nominee says he'll "never convince" to "take personal responsibility and care for their lives" has largely led to a philosophical discussion over whether it will hurt or help Romney's chances in November.
But downticket, Romney's fellow Republicans -- specifically those who find themselves in tight races -- are finding his remarks to be toxic. Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who is in a tight reelection battle against Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.), had emerged as the favorite of late, owing to Berkley getting caught up in an ethics investigation. But this donor party video has forced Heller to put some distance between himself and Romney, with Heller insisting that he has a “very different view of the world” than his party's standard-bearer. Rosalind S. Helderman of the Washington Post captures Heller's remarks:
“Keep in mind, I have five brothers and sisters. My father was an auto mechanic. My mother was a school cook. I have a very different view of the world,” Heller said. “And as United States Senator, I think I represent everyone, and every vote’s important. Every vote’s important in this race. I don’t write off anybody.”
Heller is now the third GOP Senate candidate to be affected by the practical, political fallout from Romney's remarks. Earlier this week, Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) -- whose race against Elizabeth Warren has perhaps the most noticeably populist overtones -- split with Romney over his remarks in a statement from which Heller seems to have partially cribbed:
That’s not the way I view the world. As someone who grew up in tough circumstances, I know that being on public assistance is not a spot that anyone wants to be in. Too many people today who want to work are being forced into public assistance for lack of jobs.
Brown followed the lead of his fellow New England Republican Linda McMahon, a candidate for Senate in Connecticut -- who, it should be noted, was for Romney's "47%" rhetoric before she was against it -- and Rep. Allen West (R-Fla.).
The disowning of Romney's remarks has not been limited to those seeking office in 2012. New Mexico Gov. Susanna Martinez (R) has also rebuked Romney's argument. "We have a lot of people that are at the poverty level in New Mexico, but they count just as much as anybody else,” Martinez said. “There is a net that does allow them to be caught and taken care of, whether it be through medical services, whether it be food services, whether it be with funding for apartments, for housing ... I think, certainly the fact that New Mexico provides that safety net is a good thing." Martinez will not be up for reelection until 2014, but she was a Romney endorser, a key speaker at the Republican National Convention, and was considered to be in the running for Romney's vice presidential selection.
Conservatives more oriented to the national horserace, of course, have been divided over whether Romney's remarks necessitate a "denunciation," followed by an "intervention" -- as Peggy Noonan implies -- or if they present him with a "golden opportunity," as Rush Limbaugh has suggested. When you move downticket, however, it becomes clear that Republican candidates in tight races don't have the time to spend litigating the matter -- especially at a time when the GOP is seeing its chances at reclaiming a Senate majority start to slip.
Said Heller, “I just don’t want to make it a habit of having to respond to comments made by other campaigns."

Scott Brown"That's not the way I view the world. As someone who grew up in tough circumstances, I know that being on public assistance is not a spot that anyone wants to be in. Too many people today who want to work are being forced into public assistance for lack of jobs," Scott said in an email to <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/250157-sen-scott-brown-denounces-romney-comments" target="_hplink">The Hill</a>.Paul Ryan"He was obviously inarticulate in making this point," Ryan <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/18/paul-ryan-mitt-romney-video_n_1895403.html" target="_hplink">said</a> during an interview with a Nevada television station.Rush Limbaugh"This could be the opportunity for Romney, and for that campaign, to finally take the gloves off and take the fear off and just start explaining conservatism, start explaining liberty to people and what it means," <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/18/rush-limbaugh-mitt-romney_n_1893882.html" target="_hplink">Limbaugh said</a> Tuesday. "And explain that they don't need to be in that 47 percent. There's no reason for them, for everybody to be -- essentially having given up on their future in this country. There's no reason for it. This is, to me, such an opportunity to espouse conservatism."Allen West"Mitt Romney probably could have better explained himself. I think he was a little clumsy in doing this," <a href="http://thehill.com/video/house/249975-rep-allen-west-romney-a-little-clumsy-with-47-percent-comment" target="_hplink">West said</a> on Fox News.David Brooks"Sure, there are some government programs that cultivate patterns of dependency in some people. I'd put federal disability payments and unemployment insurance in this category. But, as a description of America today, Romney's comment is a country-club fantasy. It's what self-satisfied millionaires say to each other. It reinforces every negative view people have about Romney," <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/opinion/brooks-thurston-howell-romney.html?ref=davidbrooks" target="_hplink">Brooks wrote</a>. "He's running a depressingly inept presidential campaign. Mr. Romney, your entitlement reform ideas are essential, but when will the incompetence stop?"
Bill Kristol"It remains important for the country that Romney wins in November (unless he chooses to step down and we get the Ryan-Rubio ticket we deserve!). But that shouldn't blind us to the fact that Romney's comments, like those of Obama four years ago, are stupid and arrogant," <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/note-romney-s-arrogant-and-stupid-remarks_652548.html" target="_hplink">Kristol wrote</a>.Dana LoeschDonald Trump"He has to not apologize, because we've seen enough apologizing already, and he cannot apologize," <a href="http://thehill.com/video/campaign/249993-trump-romney-cannot-apologize-for-inartful-comments-at-fundraiser" target="_hplink">Trump said</a> on NBC News. "What he said is probably what he means."
Trump also said that Romney's words were "inartfully stated."Erick Erickson"The Romney campaign should double down on what he said. They should own it. The trouble for the left and media (but I repeat myself) is that most Americans agree with Mitt Romney. Most Americans consider themselves part of the 53% and it is not a winning proposition for Barack Obama to convince Americans they are less than they think they are when most Americans already recognize he has made them less than they were," <a href="http://www.redstate.com/2012/09/17/treat-the-press-as-enemy-collaborators/" target="_hplink">Erickson wrote</a> in a blog post on RedState.com. Chris Christie"[Romney] believes that every American has got to have skin in the game...he doesn't want what the president wants," <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/09/christie-romney-wants-to-empower-people-135893.html" target="_hplink">Christie said</a> on Fox News, adding that Romney wants to "empower individuals...and that's what he's really talking about." Laura Ingraham"The idea that you're declaring, 'Well, the race is over. Mitt Romney doesn't care about people,'" <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/laura-ingraham-fired-up-over-romneys-47-tape-its-ridiculous-this-is-getting-airtime/" target="_hplink">Ingraham said </a>on Fox News. "Meanwhile, you have a president whose policies have undermined the 47 percent. ... I'm very pumped up about this. I think it's ridiculous that people are seizing on it and that we're even giving all that much airtime to it, frankly."Linda McMahon"I disagree with Governor Romney's insinuation that 47% of Americans believe they are victims who must depend on the government for their care. I know that the vast majority of those who rely on government are not in that situation because they want to be. People today are struggling because the government has failed to keep America competitive, failed to support job creators, and failed to get our economy back on track," <a href="http://www.lindaforsenate2012.com/news/press-releases/2012/09/18/linda-mcmahon-response-to-mitt-romneys-remarks/" target="_hplink">McMahon said</a> in a statement.Jonah Goldberg"To read many of the reactions on Twitter, you'd think Mother Jones had just found video of Mitt Romney strangling a hooker with her own pantyhose," <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/322394/quick-thoughts-freeloaderdammerung-jonah-goldberg" target="_hplink">Goldberg wrote</a>. "Indeed, many people understand what Romney is getting at here, even if he's saying it badly."

Although some argue whether the art of the striptease is making a comeback or never disappeared in New York City, neo-burlesque grabbed the stage by the spotlight and won't let go. Don't be shy to enter the glittery sparkly world of burlesque, and get an education on the bump-n-grind.
In November, Screen Gems released the film Burlesque starring Cher and Christina Agileria , a story about a mid-western girl who hopped on a bus to LA, accidentally discovered burlesque and became a successful performer. Even the New York Public Library knows burlesque. On January 8th the NYPL celebrated the birthday of Gypsy Rose Lee, queen of classic burlesque.
Wednesday the 19th John Schaefer host of Soundcheck, got down and dirty with two prominent New York City burlesque performers about neo-burlesque. On this segment, Burlesque Revival, Schaefer shoots the breeze with Jo "Boobs" Weldon and Melody Sweets about the music and dance changes in burlesque throughout the years.
Weldon, is the "head mistress" and a founder of The New York School of Burlesque and author of The Burlesque Handbook. Sweets is an original singing burlesque performer. It is not enough to tease; this gorgeous girl can sing and peel a stocking at the same time. (She even makes her own costumes!)
On the next segment of Soundcheck, The Life and Times of Gypsy Rose Lee, Schaffer follows up Burlesque Revival with a phone interview of author Karen Abbott about the famous Gypsy Rose Lee. Abbott wrote the new biography, American Rose: A Nation Laid Bare, The Life and Times of Gypsy Rose Lee. On Thursday January 20th, Dita Von Teese appeared on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation to spice up the episode. The plot line was not nearly as amazing as Dita Von Teese's sparkling costume. However, we can thank Jerry Bruckheimer for bringing a tasteful sliver of glamorous burlesque to prime time television.

Tell It All, Tell It Early, Tell It Yourself
By Lanny J. Davis
The headline above was the strategic crisis-management mantra when I worked at the Clinton White House in 1996-98 as special counsel to the president. It was my job to deal with the scandal-hungry White House press corps and act as media spokesman. I am reminded of that strategy as it seems increasingly likely -- I hope I am wrong! -- that the Republicans will take over the House in the November elections. And if they do, the Obama White House lawyers might consider following a similar three-part strategy to what we did in the Clinton White House in response to dozens of subpoenas from more than 20 Senate and House congressional committees investigating the 1996 Clinton campaign's fundraising practices. First, by "telling it all," we meant disclosing all facts -- especially the bad ones, i.e., the ones most likely to lead to embarrassing and even politically harmful media coverage. Why? The president's press secretary, Mike McCurry, who crafted this overall strategy, used logic as irrefutable as it was counterintuitive: We need to help reporters write all the bad stories, and if they don't ask the right nasty questions, help them do so. Why? Because if we didn't get the nasty facts out and stories written, then the Republicans surely would. But if we leaked all the facts, good and bad, we had a better chance of a story written with context -- with our comments or "spin" included higher up in the story. (By the way, Professor McCurry insisted on equal-opportunity leaking -- we rotated our leaks among all the major news organizations and reporters covering the White House.)
Sometimes, when there was a plethora of nasty stories in a particular collection of documents, it was more efficient to do what came to be called by the White House press corps the "document dump." We would dump all the documents on a conference table in the Old Executive Office Building and invite all the White House reporters to come over and read what they wanted, and we were there to answer all their questions. At times, if there was a nasty document they had missed, I would be sure to point it out to one or more reporters. Second, by "telling it early," we meant getting the stories written well before the Republicans could break the bad news with maximum negative impact at nationally televised hearings scheduled for the summer of 1997. Instead, when the hearings were held, due to our proactive early strategy, the main bad stories had already been written months before. Thus, during the hearings, I and my colleagues routinely circulated among reporters, reminding them that hearings were oh-so-boring because they were about "old news, been there, done that." At one point, a frustrated Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), then the chairman of the Senate investigating committee, introduced a brand-new topic that we White House lawyers hadn't known about. He declared with unconcealed glee on national TV, "Even Lanny Davis won't be able to say that this is old news." Everyone laughed -- especially McCurry and me, because we knew this proved our strategy had worked. Third, "telling it ourselves" meant as attorneys we had to learn to speak directly to reporters. Unlike non-attorney press spokesmen, we attorneys who provided legal advice were protected by attorney-client privilege from being compelled to testify as to that advice. (Some attorneys believe there is no such privilege for White House attorneys who are paid by taxpayers, especially if there is a criminal investigation.)
In sum: My advice to my friends in the Obama White House counsel's office, if the Republicans take over and begin to issue subpoenas and conduct hearings, is to use our three-part strategy and repeat every day the simple three-sentence message: "Republicans want to investigate, not legislate. It's all about politics. What a waste!"
Game, set, match. The American people will get it. Trust me. # # # # #

As the California Senate sits poised to vote on what could be game-changing legislation in the American battle to control plastic waste, the author of the Single-Use Bag Reduction Act (AB 1998), California Assemblymember Julia Brownley, delivered a blistering expose of the false figures being used by the plastics industry trade association, the American Chemistry Council (ACC), to oppose her bill. Assemblymember Brownley appeared at UCLA's James Bridges Theater to address a crowd gathered for the Plastic Pollution Coalition's screening of the documentary Bag It! and other short films concerning the environmental and economic impacts of single-use plastic bags. Brownley played radio ads, television ads and showed enlarged images of mailers all being employed by The ACC in an attempt to defeat the largest alliance of supporters ever amassed in California to support single-use bag reduction. Environmental groups like Heal the Bay, a Santa Monica based ocean protection non-profit that conducts volunteer beach clean-ups in the Los Angeles Area, have long been seeking legislative solutions to the plastic bag pollution that inundates California rivers, storm drains, beaches and our offshore waters. However, the present legislative effort, Julia Brownley's Assembly Bill 1998, is the first to attract the support of the California Grocers Association, labor unions, and a wide variety of businesses. Even Hollywood has voiced its support for the legislation. The ACC is spearheading opposition to the proposed legislation.
The ACC advertisements are misleading in many ways, according to Assemblymember Brownley. The ads predict a loss of jobs when relatively few single-use plastic bags are made in California and there is the opportunity for new green jobs producing reusable bags in this state to meet a burgeoning need. In addition, the ads talk about a new bureaucracy when none is called for in this legislation. The ads suggest that California will be deforested because people will switch to paper bags when the impact of similar legislation in other jurisdictions has been a very successful switch to reusable bags, not paper bags. AB 1998 would also up the post-consumer recycled content of paper bags to save trees. Despite claims made by the ACC, California will actually save money with this legislation as millions of dollars of our state and local budgets are currently used to fund park and beach clean-ups, to clean storm drains and roadways, and to landfill plastic bags. Finally, the ACC ads fail to note that provisions are made in AB 1998 to supply reusable bags to individuals who cannot afford them. The ACC used similar tactics, spending millions to kill an ordinance in Seattle, and the stakes for the plastics industry are much higher with the proposed statewide ban in California. However, California is already home to several local plastic bag bans, and many other jurisdictions plan to enact them in the near future after recovering from ACC lawsuits and ACC backed legislation prohibiting fees on plastic bags in California. Some jurisdictions have been sued by the ACC requiring them to produce Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs) evaluating any environmental impacts of banning plastic bags, a seemingly perverse use of the EIR requirement. Los Angeles County recently issued a draft EIR that finds positive environmental benefits by reducing plastic pollution through its proposed legislation. Many businesses support a statewide ordinance as more business-friendly than a patchwork of local regulations that are not uniform.
Plastic Bags are the number one consumer product in America. Most were made in China until they were banned in that country in 2008 for their costly environmental damage. Mexico City also recently banned plastic bags joining more than 40 jurisdictions worldwide that ban single-use plastic bags, amounting to more than 25% of the world's population. California Governor Arnold Shwarzenegger has voiced his intention to sign AB 1998 into law if it reaches his desk. To learn more about AB 1998 and to help this law reach the Governor's desk, please respond to this action. Also, please enjoy and share the following Public Service Announcements about AB 1998.
