Michigan 2020 Plan To Give Tuition Grants To Undergrads Promoted With $10,000 Scholarship Competition
Democrats are pushing the Michigan 2020 Plan, which would give college tuition grants for students attending in-state public community colleges and universities, with a one-time, $10,000 scholarship. The Huffington Post

Free in-state college tuition for every Michigan student is a real possibility under a new state Democrat-backed plan. It's called "Michigan 2020," and it's also the reason for a new competitive scholarship.
The college affordability plan, announced in January and set to be introduced later this week with approval from Michigan Senate Democrats, would give each graduate of a Michigan high school an education grant of approximately $9,500 each year for in-state university or community college tuition. The estimated $1.8 billion proposal would be funded by putting a term limit on corporate tax credits and charging state sales tax to online retailers.
The newly launched #mi2020 Scholarship Competition will be a $10,000 blessing for one student -- and perfect promotional tactic for the Senate Democrats' Michigan 2020 Plan. Participants must create a video explaining the impact of the proposed legislation. The video competition is one part social media marketing, one part crowd-sourcing, and an attempt to rally students and their parents around the Democrats' legislative agenda.
"We're encouraging students to be as creative as they can about what this plan could mean for them," said Robert McCann, communications director for the Michigan Senate Democrats. The competition will be partially decided by public voting -- so the savvy 17-year-old who takes to Twitter to promote his or her video with the scholarship's built-in hashtag will have a leg up on the competition. After the entry period closes on April 20, public voting begins, with the top 20 vote-winners, and perhaps most viral videos, going on to the finals. The winner will be chosen at the end of May by a second round of voting and a panel of judges.
The Michigan 2020 proposal comes as President Obama campaigns on a platform to make college more affordable, in part by encouraging universities to slow tuition increases.
In Michigan, college affordability is an issue that resonates with undergrads and their families. College costs have risen dramatically statewide, after Gov. Rick Snyder cut higher education funding 15 percent last year, but also forced state colleges and universities to cap their tuition increases at 7 percent. Many institutions raised tuition to just below the cap, passing on the costs to students.
While the 2020 plan would not cover all costs at some institutions -- at University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, in-state tuition and fees total over $12,000 per year -- the grants would go a long way to making college affordable across the board without saddling students with large loans to repay once they've graduated. The #mi2020 scholarship competition is backed by private donors who support the Michigan 2020 plan and want to raise its profile. "While we're giving one student the opportunity to take advantage of it this year, we're hoping all students will be able to," in the future, said McCann.
For more information and to enter the video competition, see www.mi2020video.com. Also on HuffPost:	FOLLOW HUFFPOST DETROIT

Ledbetter Fair Pay Act Not Enough

Comments
President Obama is set to sign his first piece of legislation this week - the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. You may remember Ledbetter's case. She worked for Goodyear tire and rubber for most of her career, and found out after many years that she had been paid less than the men doing the same job all along. To add insult to injury, she had trained a couple of these guys.
The George W. Bush/ Roberts/Alito Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that though Ledbetter had indeed experienced discrimination, she was not entitled to damages because she hadn't filed her lawsuit within 180 days of that first short paycheck - never mind that she didn't discover the discrimination for more than a decade. The ruling overturned 40+ years of precedent. Up until Ledbetter v. Goodyear, courts had always ruled that a victim of wage discrimination had 180 days from the day she found out about it to file suit, and that each new short paycheck started the countdown clock over again. In passing the new bill, Congress and President Obama have restored the law to the way it has been interpreted for the last four decades.
But if you think that's the answer to women's pay inequity prayers, you're dead wrong. Just getting us back to even is not nearly enough to overcome that stubborn wage gap. Women still make only 77 cents to the dollar a man makes for full time year round work. We need more - much more. The main reason Lilly Ledbetter got shafted was that she didn't know her situation compared to the men. Employers are under no obligation to report pay statistics, and in most companies you can get fired for talking pay with co-workers. Though federal legislation to fix these two problems is in the pipeline, it's been in the pipeline for over a decade, and the light at the end is nowhere in sight.
The governor of one state - New Mexico - is not waiting. Bill Richardson (Obama's choice for commerce secretary who voluntarily dropped out of consideration) has just signed an executive order in his state that is ground breaking. Not only will the state as an employer have to study and report it's own pay practices when it comes to gender and race, so will private sector companies that want state contracts. Richardson has declared overcoming pay inequity and job segregation a priority, and established a high-powered task force to implement the needed changes.
Employers are likely to wail and gnash their teeth. Won't this cost money? Well maybe, but probably not that much. They already know who works for them, the gender and race of their employees, and how much they're paid by job category. So gathering the data ought to be relatively simple. Besides, all employers won't have to do it - just those that want state contracts, paid with dollars from taxpayers. In this day of bailouts and boondoggles at taxpayer expense, citizens footing the bills have a right to expect that any company getting government business pays its workers fairly. And there will be technical assistance and reasonable exceptions for small business.
By doing internal pay equity analyses, companies that have a problem and don't know it will be able to find out and fix it before they get hauled into court for discrimination. And if they're not doing anything wrong, they ought to be proud of it and willing to tell the world. Sure would cut down on all those "frivolous lawsuits" if employees could see the statistics up front and know they weren't being shorted in the pay envelope.
Congress did the right thing by bringing us back to a 40 year old standard when it fixed Ledbetter. But the State of New Mexico is way ahead of the curve, looking forward, not backward. Women should challenge the other 49 governors to follow suit, particularly one self-described "feminist" who can see Russia from her house.
