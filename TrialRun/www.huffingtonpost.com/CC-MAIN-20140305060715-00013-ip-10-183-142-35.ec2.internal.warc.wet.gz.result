Politics News
By Tim Gaynor PHOENIX, July 25 (Reuters) - A U.S. Latino citizen fought back tears at an Arizona sheriff's racial profiling trial on Wednesday as he described being pulled over by a deputy and having his groin frisked during a traffic stop he said was motivated by his ethnicity. Contractor Daniel Magos, 67, testified at the civil trial of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio that he was pulled over by a deputy as he drove with his U.S.-born wife to meet a client in December 2009, ostensibly because of a missing license plate on the trailer of his pickup. Magos described the deputy "yelling" at him and his wife during the stop, at which he provided his license and insurance papers and declared a legally-held handgun. Told to spread his legs while being searched, Magos fought back tears when he was asked to describe how he felt being patted down in the underarms and groin. "Humiliated, worthless, defenseless," he said of the morning traffic stop in the Phoenix valley, which did not result in any charges or citations. Arpaio, who styles himself "America's toughest sheriff," is on trial in U.S. District Court in Phoenix in a class-action lawsuit that will test whether police can target undocumented immigrants without racially profiling Hispanic citizens and legal residents. The 80-year-old lawman testified under oath on Tuesday he was against "anyone racial profiling" and denied that his office arrested "people because of the color of their skin." The sheriff, who is seeking re-election to a sixth term in November, has been a lightning rod for controversy over his aggressive enforcement of immigration laws in the border state with Mexico, as well as his investigation into the validity of President Barack Obama's birth certificate. The suit was brought against Arpaio and his office on behalf of five Hispanics who say they were stopped by deputies because they were Latino, which Arpaio denies. The trial focuses attention on Arizona, which was in the news last month when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a key element of the state's crackdown on undocumented immigrants requiring police to investigate those they stop and suspect of being in the country without documentation. The Obama administration had challenged the crackdown in court, saying the U.S. Constitution gave the federal government sole authority over immigration policy. Arpaio faces a separate, broader lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department in May, alleging systematic profiling, sloppy and indifferent police work and a disregard for minority rights. The plaintiffs in the suit include the Somos America immigrants' rights coalition and all Latino drivers stopped by the office since 2007. Magos, who was born in Mexico and took up U.S. citizenship 45 years ago, said the deputy later apologized and told him the stop "had nothing to do with racial profiling," which Magos disputed. "I told him that's exactly what it was." Magos testified, saying he took down the deputy's name and badge number, and days later lodged a complaint with the American Civil Liberties Union. Asked if the incident changed his view of the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, or MCSO, he said: "I lost respect for the MCSO's deputies and sheriff." Asked if he felt he was treated differently for his ethnicity, he said "Yes." The court also heard testimony from deputy Michael Kikes, a motorcycle officer who took part in an immigration sweep over two days in March 2008. Kikes described pulling over a sport utility vehicle with a Hispanic driver during the operation. Asked if the arrest, which resulted in no charges, was motivated by race or ethnicity, he said: "No." The jury trial before Judge Murray Snow is expected to run until August 2.

Earlier on HuffPost:	Loading Slideshow
Maricopa County Employees Call Latinos Derogatory NamesJail employees frequently refer to Latinos as "wetbacks," "Mexican bitches," and "stupid Mexicans," according to the lawsuit. An email that included a photography of a Chihahua dressed in swimming gear with the caption "A Rare Photo of a Mexican Navy Seal" was widely distributed by sheriff's office supervisors.Officers Mistreat Latinos In Routine Traffic EnforcementThe lawsuit recounts how a Latina woman who was five-months pregnant and a U.S. citizen was stopped as she pulled into the driveway. "After she exited her car, the officer then insisted that she sit on the hood of the car. When she refused, the officer grabbed her arms, puled them behind her back, and slammed her, stomach first, into the vehicle three times. He then dragged her to the patrol car and shoved her into the backseat," reads the complaint.
She was cited for failure to provide identification, which was later changed to failure to provide proof of insurance. The issue was resolved when the woman proved she had insurance to a court.
In yet another case, two officers followed a Latina U.S. citizen a quarter of a mile to her home without flashing their lights. When she arrived home, they insisted that she stay in the car. The reason for the stop was a "non-functioning license plate light." After she tried to enter her home, officers took her to the ground, kneed her in the back and handcuffed her. She was brought to a Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) substation and cited for "disorderly conduct," which was later dismissed, according to the lawsuit.Latinos Are Indiscriminately Detained In Immigration RaidsA Latina born in the United States was taken into custody for four hours in a raid to determine her immigration status. Arpaio was quoted in response, "That's just normal police work. You sometimes take people in for probable cause for questioning and they're released." The suit notes that the reason for her detainment -- being Latina and present during a raid -- were insufficient.Arpaio And MCSO Staff Foster Discrimination Against LatinosArpaio received a letter reading, "If you have dark skin, then you have dark skin. Unfortunately, that is the look of the Mexican illegals who are here illegally. ... I'm begging you to come over ... and round them all up." The sheriff labeled this as "intelligence" and forwarded to his deputy chief of enforcement operations for someone to "handle this."
Upon receiving a letter backing the policy of "stopping Mexicans to make sure they are legal," he sent a letter of appreciation to the authors and kept three copies for himself, according to the lawsuit.
An email circulated among MCSO staff had an image of a fake driver's license from "Mexifornia" and listed the driver's class as "illegal alien."MCSO Employees Fail To Provide Assistance To Prisoners With Limited EnglishThe failure to provide adequate language assistance caused some female Latina prisoners to remain with sheets or pants soiled from menstruation, alleges the suit.
Others have allegedly been put in solitary confinement for "extended periods of time" for not understanding a command in English.MCSO Arrests Arpaio Critics Expressing Their First Amendment RightsThe suit claims on multiple occasions that people were arrested for merely applauding against the office's immigration policies. The judge presiding over the case of the arrestees found that the deputy who made the arrest "believes it is his role to make uncomfortable anyone who express[es] views that disagree with the sheriff" and that he had "trampled" over the First Amendment. The court acquitted them.

Dr. Otis Brawley, Chief Medical Officer of the American Cancer Society, voiced strong support for annual mammography for women beginning at age 40 in an Op-Ed piece published November 20, 2009, in newspapers nationwide. This position is in sharp contrast to his statement about mammography made in the New York Times on Wednesday, October 21, 2009. On that day he told women "We don't want people to panic, but I'm admitting that American medicine has overpromised when it comes to screening. The advantages to screening have been exaggerated." Dr. Brawley has known about the questionable benefits of screening for more than a decade. Regarding mammography, his words in the August 2000 issue of Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America were, "There has been considerable debate about the benefit:harm ratio of mammography screening for women below the age of 50 years, and about what proportion of the observed benefit arises from screening that occurs after these women have entered their 50s." The burden of proof of "the benefits outweighing the harms" rests with those making the recommendations--the American Cancer Society and its Chief Medical Officer in this case. Dr. Brawley has voiced doubt about the benefits of mammography, and now appears conflicted by communicating two opposing stands in less than a month. The American Cancer Society, on the other hand, has remained steadfast in a position that enhances the profits of breast cancer-related businesses, regardless of the effects on women.
Adequate scientific evidence to stop mass screening programs, such as mammography, has been readily available for more than three decades. In 1976 Pietro M. Gullino presented his findings on the natural history of cancer, showing "early detection" is really "late detection," at the Conference on Breast Cancer: A Report to the Profession, sponsored by the White House, the National Cancer Institute, and the American Cancer Society. He explained: "If the time required for a tumor to double its diameter during a known period of time is taken as a measure of growth rate, one can calculate by extrapolation that two-thirds of the duration of a breast cancer remains undetectable by the patient or physician. Long before a breast carcinoma can be detected by present technology, metastatic spread may occur and does in most cases." This report was subsequently published in the journal representing the American Cancer Society (Cancer 1977 Jun;39(6 Suppl):2697-703). This largely invisible natural history of breast cancer was further explained to doctors and scientists in 1997 in an article published in the Journal of Surgical Oncology titled, "On the growth rates of human malignant tumors: implications for medical decision-making." The authors, Friberg and Mattson concluded, "Most tumors are several years old when detectable by present-day diagnostic methods. This makes the term 'early detection' questionable." (J Surg Oncol. 1997 Aug;65(4):284-97). For a cancer in the breast to grow from one cell to one centimeter in diameter--a size that can be detected by breast self-examination or mammography--on average takes ten years. Unfortunately, when the cancer is still so tiny that it cannot be detected, it nevertheless has already spread (metastasized in medical terminology) to other parts of the body in virtually every case of true cancer (as opposed to the latent forms of cancer). It is the cancer cells that have spread to, say, the liver, lungs, bones, and brain, that kill the patient, and not the cancer cells confined to the breast.
Just as tragic is the devastation to the lives of millions of women with indolent cancers (the latent forms) that would have never appeared in their lifetime if no one had been busy looking for them with screening programs. Once found, these nonthreatening lesions are aggressively treated with life-changing surgeries, radiation treatments, and/or chemotherapies.
The American Cancer Society and its representatives need to provide an unambiguous message to women that screening mammography is a blunt technology, and that even after four decades of use the evidence has not shown that the benefits outweigh the harms. Understanding the natural history of this disease could lead to no other conclusion. John McDougall, MD

A New Year, a New Law
Effective January 1, 2011, an amendment to Section 443 of the New York State Real Property Law will significantly change the way brokers selling co-ops and condos in New York disclose their agency relationships with their clients. Although the law of agency, which governs the relationship between brokers and their principals, has not changed, there is now an obligation to disclose the agency relationship in writing and to obtain written consent of both seller and buyer when dual agency exists. Since co-ops and condos were previously excluded from written disclosure requirements, many brokers are dealing with these concepts for the first time. Let's Start with the Basics
A broker has three possible agency relationships with a prospective principal: the broker can act as agent for the seller; the broker can act as agent for the buyer; or
the broker can act as "dual agent" for both seller and buyer. Since a broker, as "agent for a principal," has an absolute duty of loyalty to that principal, when dual agency is created by the broker acting as agent for both seller and buyer, the loyalty owed by the agent to the principal is diminished, as the broker then has a duty of loyalty to both the seller and the buyer. It is for this reason that many believe (including myself) that dual agency is not in the best interests of the parties. Nevertheless, since there's now a legal obligation to disclose agency relationships, and since dual agency can't be avoided in a number of situations, it's important for brokers to understand the basics of how and when the disclosure should occur. The First Substantive Contact
Brokers must accept the fact that there is a new administrative detail that must be attended to at the commencement of a broker's relationship with a seller (that is, when a listing agreement is signed, assuming an exclusive) or with a potential buyer (when the broker starts the process of showing that potential buyer various apartments). As the statute requires, once that relationship is created with the principal it must be disclosed to the other party when the first "substantive contact" occurs, by completing and delivering the revised form available on the New York State website and from REBNY to its members.
When Does that First Substantive Contact Occur?
Here's the first slippery step on the slippery slope. Until there is litigation and the courts determine, as a matter of law, when the "first substantive contact" is deemed to occur, no one really knows when that moment has arrived. So until the courts tell us otherwise, here are two rules to follow that should ratchet down the stress level of making that determination:
First:
As soon as a broker is directed, engaged or retained in any way by either a seller or a buyer to act for that party, the agency relationship has been created and the appropriate disclosure form should be signed.
Thereafter:
At the first material communication with the other party (whether by email, telephone or open house interaction) the broker's relationship with his or her principal should be disclosed.
But is Signing and Delivering the Form Sufficient to Satisfy the Disclosure Obligation?
A resounding "no" is the appropriate answer. It is essential for brokers to understand that there are two prongs to the disclosure obligation. Yes, there is an obligation to obtain the written consent of the principal, but more importantly, before any paperwork gets signed, the principal must understand the nature of the agency relationship that the principal is entering into with the agent. As required by the statute, it is the broker's responsibility to insure that the principal has "informed consent." The same is true with the disclosure obligation to other parties. It's all well and good to announce that you're the seller's agent, unless the party you're announcing to doesn't really know what you're talking about.
How to Insure that the Parties Understand the Agency Relationships
Again, we're out on the moors in the fog, but there are steps that can and should be taken to give the broker confidence that he or she has acted in a commercially reasonable manner to explain the agency relationships to both seller and buyer.
Use the Form: The disclosure form itself defines each agency relationship in relatively clear terms and the broker should review the narrative on the form with the principal before the form is signed and thereafter when the form is distributed.
Use Your Website: As REBNY is now requiring execution of the forms prior to use of a Virtual Office Website, a tab should be created on the broker's VOW which includes the applicable forms, a discussion of agency relationships and a method for execution of the forms. Links to industry and government resources and other materials that address these issues should also be considered. Use a Cover Letter: Consider preparing a cover letter, in which the principal acknowledges that he or she has read and understands the nature of the agency relationship; Use an Attorney: Ultimately, every seller and buyer will have legal representation in connection with the transaction. A broker who is not comfortable explaining the complexities of the agency relationships, could advise the prospective client to have the form reviewed by his or her attorney prior to signing. Is this necessary in every transaction... no. But as the complexity of the agency relationships increase, a broker should consider informed consent to include review of the disclosure by the principal's attorney before the form is signed.
The Minefield Known as Advance Consent
We live in a world of mega-companies and real estate brokerage is no exception. With co-op and condo transactions, it is often the case that the same large brokerage firm has an agent on each side of the transaction. Despite the so-called firewall within the firm and each agent's undivided loyalty to each party, once the same firm is on both sides of the transaction, dual agency occurs...period. So if you are taking a "customer" around to various open houses and your fellow agent has the exclusive on a particular apartment, dual agency is deemed to occur when the first substantive contact is made with the other broker.
The Lobbying Logic of Advance Consent
So the industry lobby decided that it would be a good idea to allow brokers to obtain "advance consent" to dual agency, primarily for those situations when the same brokerage firm is on the both sides of the transaction. An agent can ask his or her customer to agree to advance consent "with a designated agent," so that the dual agency relationship is consented to in advance when a broker goes to an open house with an agent from the same firm. The broker not only has to explain the nature of dual agency, but also has the obligation to explain "advance" dual agency. Yes, it's very confusing, both substantively and logistically. I don't think we can fashion a "one size fits all" rule as to when advance consent should be obtained, but we can set out a few metrics to consider when a relationship with a seller or buyer commences:
First and foremost, when a broker has an exclusive, the seller should be asked to give advance consent, to accommodate the possibility of a direct buyer making an offer on the apartment.
Secondly, before beginning the process of schlepping the buyer around to apartments, the customer should be asked to consent to advance dual agency with a designated agent, as the likelihood of going to a listing with the same firm on both sides is expected.
But if you're just not sure what to do, consider the following Rule of Thumb:
When in doubt as to whether you are acting as a dual agent, disclose, discuss and obtain written consent to act as dual agent.
About that Uncooperative Seller or Buyer...
There is a ripcord available when a seller or buyer refuses to sign the required disclosure form. The broker should prepare the statutory "Affirmation" indicating that the party was asked to sign the form and refused. That being said, once a party refuses to acknowledge the broker's role in the transaction, all bets are off on what might develop down the road. For this reason, getting the forms signed up front is the broker's best protection.
Residential Reality: Think Rubik's Cube
There are many twists and turns and many combinations that can create a principal-agent relationship, as well as the more complicated dual agency relationship. So consider this the beginning of the conversation. Brokers should consult counsel as well as look to industry organizations (that were instrumental in implementing these changes) for assistance and guidance in figuring out the appropriate course of conduct as the process evolves over time. Now is the time to ask your questions and to clarify disclosure obligations, as the broker is now charged with the duty to obtain what might be the elusive informed consent of both seller and buyer in every co-op and condo transaction.
