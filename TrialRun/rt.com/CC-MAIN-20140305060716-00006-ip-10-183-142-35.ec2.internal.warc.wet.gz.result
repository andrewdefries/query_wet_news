Anti-govt protests as Venezuela mourns on first anniversary of Chavez's death

Bolivian President Evo Morales, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, and Cuban President Raul Castro attended the parade among other guests. However, the kickoff of a 10-day commemoration didn't stop protesters from demonstrating against the Maduro administration.
