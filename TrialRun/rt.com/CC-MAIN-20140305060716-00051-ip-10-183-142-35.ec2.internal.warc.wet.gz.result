Conflict, Court, Crime, Law, Russia Nine foreign Greenpeace activists were granted bail by Russian court in the city of St. Petersburg. A total of 12 out of 30 crewmembers detained over the protest at an oil rig in the Barents Sea have had bail approved.
They all are to be released while awaiting trial as soon as
Greenpeace makes bail for them.
The court in St. Petersburg on Tuesday set bail at 2 million
rubles ($61,500) for each of them. Greenpeace said it would
transfer the money as soon as possible. Greenpeace activists granted bail:
1. Ana Paula Alminhana Maciel
(BRA)
2. Miguel Hernan Perez Orsi
(ARG)
3. David John Haussmann (NZ)
4. Tomasz Dziemianczuk (PL)
5. Camila Speziale (ARG)
6. Cristian D'Alessandro
(ITA)
7. Paul Ruzycki (CAN)
8. Sini Saarela
(FI)
9. Francesco Pisanu (FRA)
10. Yekaterina Zaspa (RUS)
11. Denis Sinyakov (RUS)
12. Andrey Allakhverdov (RUS)
“We still have no idea what conditions our friends will endure
when they are released from jail, whether they will be held under
house arrest or even allowed outside,” Greenpeace
International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo, said reacting on
news stressing that they were still “charged and could spend
years behind bars if they are convicted.” On Monday another St. Petersburg court granted bail to three
Russians who were aboard the ship: a doctor, Ekaterina Zaspa,
freelance photographer Denis Sinyakov and Greenpeace Russia press
office chief Andrey Allakhverdov.
Greenpeace said Tuesday that it has prepared 6 million rubles
(US$184,500) in bail for the three Russian crewmembers. A wire
transfer of the money is required within two working days.
A separate court in St Petersburg also on Monday refused to free
Australian activist Colin Russell.
“Colin was refused bail and sent back to prison for three
months. The Arctic 30 will not be free until every last one of
them is back home with their families," Naidoo said.
The 28 activists and two reporters from 18 different countries
were arrested on September 19 following their protest at
Gazprom’s Prirazlomnaya oil platform in the Barents Sea a day
earlier.
They were first charged with piracy, which carries a possible
jail sentence of 15 years. However, Russia’s Investigative
Committee reduced the charges to hooliganism. The hooliganism
charge carries a maximum penalty of seven years. At 21, Camila is the youngest member of the #Arctic30.
She was excited and nervous about being so far from home

However, the environmental organization insists its activists are
innocent of either charge. As one of the arguments against the
piracy charges, Greenpeace said the Arctic Sunrise ship did not
breach the 500-meter zone around the platform, adding that this
could be proved by satellite data.
At the same time Russian prosecutors say Greenpeace activists
“posed a real threat” to employees when they attempted to
scale Gazprom’s Prirazlomnaya oil platform.
Meanwhile, the presidential adviser on human rights, Mikhail
Fedotov, said on Tuesday that a two-month-long dispute over the
Greenpeace activists could be solved diplomatically and “there is
no juridical solution.”
“I think, this conflict should be settled on diplomatic level,
there is no juridical solution,” Mikhail Fedotov, the head of
the Human Rights Committee (HRC), said. "They did not seize
anything. There was no hooliganism. There is nothing here,”
he said. The HRC chief said he will send a letter of appreciation to
general prosecution for not insisting on an extension of the
detention of the Greenpeace activists.

I just saw the updated article on RT tv; 28 on bail. Putin made a brilliant statement about 'good causes' and kindness in bailing them. Mr. President, I remember the cold war very well because my family members were involved. I think they'd be very proud of you right now: You've become the best statesman alive (one of a handful worldwide.) If you could encourage an Indy candidate in 2016 (Bernie Sanders, Angus King, Elizabeth Warren, eg) and help us end the perpetual partying of the Democrats and Republicans. That would benefit both our countries and everyone else, too.

Wil 20.11.2013 14:49 Ha ve you seen the big sails on this ship and innovative mast to increase sail surface. One of the most environmentally friendly ships ever built. Paid for by millions of Greenpeace supporters worldwide. Pa id by people who are misled by GP. Such people would always exist, of course.

Кэрол 19.11.2013 14:37 One more thought.... where did greenpeace get the 6 million rubles on short notice, and what did they use for collateral? Their ship?
Something is amiss in river city. If you read their annual report you can see how much money Greenpeace has and where it comes from. I remember something like 3 million financial supporters world wide and 5 million volunteers. 0
