Hunger 'games' set to worsen with homelessness on the rise across America, survey says

Crisis, Economy, Employment, USA Homelessness and hunger are spreading across America, according to a survey which looked at 25 big cities, including LA, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston and Washington; 21 percent of the demand for food assistance hasn’t been met during the past year.
Last year's national poverty rate of 15 percent hovered near the
Great Recession’s staggering record of 15 percent, according to
the Census Bureau. Although the US stock market has surpassed its
pre-recession high, poor residents of some major American cities
have not gained from the country's economic wins, the new report
has shown. The number of people in the poverty trap went up from
46.2 million in 2011 to 46.5 million in 2012. These figures
remained slightly changed from 2010 when the number of poor
people reached the highest level in the more than half-century
that poverty estimates have been published. The poverty rate in
2012 was 2.5 percentage points higher than that reported in 2007,
the year before the economic recession.
Over 80 percent of US cities reported that requests for emergency
food assistance had increased by an average of 7 percent over the
past year. The rate of increase ranged from 15 percent in Salt
Lake City, 12 percent in Washington DC, 11 percent in Dallas, and
10 percent in Charlotte and Trenton, to 5 percent in Cleveland
and 4 percent in Louisville.
Unemployment tops the list of causes of hunger cited by the
survey cities, followed by low wages, poverty, and high housing
costs.
The latest study conducted by the US Conference of Mayors has
shown that among those requesting emergency food assistance
nearly 60 percent were people in families; 43 percent were
employed, 21 percent were elderly, and 9 percent were homeless.
Emergency shelters in 71 percent of the survey cities had to turn
away homeless families with children because no beds were
available, while in two-thirds of the cities shelters had to turn
away single people.
Over 90 percent of the surveyed cities reported an increase in
the number of people requesting food assistance for the first
time. However, it turned out that more than 20 percent of the
people desperately needing emergency food assistance did not
receive it.
In all of the responding cities, emergency kitchens had to reduce
the quantity of food poverty-stricken people could receive at
each visit or the amount of food offered per meal. In 78 percent
of these cities, officials also had to cut down the number of
times a person or family could visit a food kitchen each month.
In two-thirds of the cities, facilities had to send people away
due to a lack of resources, according to the report.
Providing more jobs topped the city officials’ list of actions
needed to reduce hunger, with 73 percent of the cities citing the
measure as a key solution to the problem. Cited next on the list
were increasing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
benefits (by 59 percent of the cities), providing more affordable
housing (by 55 percent), and providing more employment training
programs (by 45 percent).
Meanwhile, the House of Representatives has passed legislation
that would cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP) by at least $39 billion over ten years. The Congressional
Budget Office estimates the bill would deny SNAP benefits to
about 3.8 million low-income people in 2014, and to an average of
nearly three million people each year over the coming decade.
When asked about the impact of the cuts in SNAP benefits
currently being considered by Congress, the city officials warned
that cuts would first and foremost reduce the availability of
food to vulnerable people, including children and the elderly.
"In Massachusetts, 13 percent of our population relies on
SNAP to have enough to eat and many supplement these benefits
with food from the Greater Boston Food Bank and its member
agencies. With cuts of $39 billion at the federal level, the
889,000 people who rely on hunger relief agencies will need even
more support. This means the demand for nutritious food will
increase. We will have to work harder to increase our food
acquisition and distribution," the Boston survey
contributors noted.
Officials in Charlotte, the largest city in the state of North
Carolina, have also concluded that a greater number of people
will be "forced to get by on less food", adding that food costs
are up from 8 to 15 percent over the same time last year.
"Already, 40 percent of the families in our area must choose
between paying rent or buying food. Every cut in benefits pushes
people in need closer to the brink of poverty. Not having access
to enough nutritious food creates a tragic legacy for
children."
Cleveland officials also fear their food banks and programs would
be "severely strained", and more people would go hungry simply
because there is no way for the charitable food system to make up
for such large-scale cuts. "Feeding America calculates that
these cuts would be comparable to the entire network of more than
200 food banks across the country – and the thousands of pantries
and programs to which they supply food – shutting down completely
for a year."
Meanwhile, the surveyed cities are under no illusion that
requests for emergency food assistance will keep growing, with 55
percent expecting the increase to be substantial, and 41 percent
expecting it to be moderate.
The impact of proposed cuts in SNAP benefits and the inability of
food assistance programs to meet the increased demand that would
result from cuts was pointed out as the biggest challenge in
addressing hunger in the coming year by most cities.
It has been noted that homelessness goes hand in hand with
hunger, with the total number of homeless individuals increasing
to over 50 percent over the past year, according to the survey.
There's been a 40 percent increase in Los Angeles and a 24
percent increase in Dallas, just to name a few.
The survey cities reported that on average 30 percent of homeless
adults were severely mentally ill, while 17 percent were
physically disabled, 16 percent were victims of domestic
violence, and 3 percent were HIV Positive. Nineteen percent of
homeless adults were employed and 13 percent were veterans. While
San Francisco says there has been a 30 percent reduction of
homeless veterans from 2011 to 2013, officials in Nashville
reported that their most-needed resource continues to be
"adequate, safe, clean, affordable housing units for homeless
veterans", as well as meaningful employment with a living wage,
plus "more mental health resources, including non-VA clinicians
who can diagnose PTSD [Posttraumatic stress disorder]."
Meanwhile, the number of families experiencing homelessness has
also increased across the survey cities by an average of 4
percent, with 64 percent of the cities reporting an increase and
two cities saying the number stayed the same.
Asked to identify the three major causes of homelessness among
families with children, 68 percent of the cities cited poverty,
60 percent blamed lack of affordable housing, and 56 percent
referred to unemployment.
During the past year, 35 percent of the survey cities introduced
policies aimed at preventing homelessness among households that
have lost, or may lose, their homes to foreclosure.
However, officials in 62 percent of the cities expect resources
to provide emergency shelter to decrease over the next year, with
14 percent expecting that decrease to be substantial and 48
percent expecting it to be moderate.
While 46 percent of the survey cities expect the number of
homeless individuals to increase over the next year, providing
more mainstream assisted housing is at the top of the officials’
list of actions needed.

The Roman Empire all over again. Others must remain prepared, for US despair may well be replaced by n-clear insanity.
