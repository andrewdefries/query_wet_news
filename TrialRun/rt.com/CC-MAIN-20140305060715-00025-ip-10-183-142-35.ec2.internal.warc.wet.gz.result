Animals, Court, Crime, FBI, Religion, USA The FBI is facing a lawsuit in the US District Court in Detroit for using excessive force in the killing of a Detroit Muslim leader in 2009.
­Loquman Abdullah, 53, was allegedly mauled by a police dog and riddled with 20 bullet holes after undercover agents shot him during a counterterrorism investigation.Together with several members of a religious association, the imam of Detroit’s Masjid al-Haqq was under a three-year-long FBI investigation for conducting illegal activities, including selling stolen goods from interstate shipments. On Oct. 28, 2009, undercover agents entered a warehouse during an undercover sting operation to arrest Abdullah and ten of his associates.The lawsuit against the agency, filed by 48-year old Muhammad Abdul Salaam, who was present at the shootout, claims that Abdullah was trying to protect himself from an attacking police dog, without the use of a weapon, when he was killed at a warehouse in Dearborn.The FBI claims it released the dog on the imam after the man refused to surrender.“As Abdullah struggled to prevent the canine from attacking his face, and while Abdullah was on his back, the FBI agents began shooting at him,” Salaam wrote in the affidavit. “Abdullah never pulled any weapon towards the canine or towards any of the FBI agents. At no time during that day did I see Abdullah carry a gun.”FBI agents claim the man shot the canine, but according to Salaam, only Abdullah was hurt in the encounter.The “FBI K9 repeatedly attacked and mauled Abdullah’s face, causing severe injuries to… his forehead, upper eyelid, left cheek, lower lip, lower jaw and both hands … tore off a denture device in the roof of Abdullah’s mouth, and caused Abdullah’s upper jaw to break,” the lawsuit states.Shortly thereafter, Abdullah lay dead in the warehouse after being fatally shot 20 times by the FBI agents. The Michigan attorney general and the US Justice Department’s civil rights division have said the shooting was justified. A local, state and federal investigation, each found that the federal agents did not break any laws in shooting Abdullah. But the lawsuit claims the FBI used excessive force in the man’s death.The disagreement between the FBI and the lawsuit regards the presence of a weapon in possession of Abdullah – a detail that has not been proven. Press reports do not detail how the canine was shot. Comments Add comment

Keystoned? Exxon under fire as 10k barrels of oil spills on streets, floods Arkansas town

Arkansas Oil Spill Tags
Ecology, USA ExxonMobil is continuing cleanup operations after an oil pipeline spilled thousands of barrels of Canadian crude in Arkansas. The spill has led many to speak out against oil sands exploitation and the construction of Keystone XL pipeline.
Exxon's Pegasus pipeline – which can carry more than 90,000
barrels of Canadian Heavy crude oil per day from Patoka,
Illinois, to Nederland, Texas – was shut down after the leak was
discovered on Friday in a suburban area near the town of
Mayflower, Arkansas.

RT's in-depth day-by-day timeline on the Arkansas oil spill
Shocking amateur video recorded by a resident that went viral,
showing the immediate aftermath of the spill as streets flooded
and oil burst forth:
"The smell is quite horrendous both outside and inside our
home. There is a strong smell of oil in our vehicles, as
well," resident Chris Harrell told RT.
Twenty-two homes have been evacuated so far, and more are
expected. "Excavation is necessary as part of an
investigation to determine the cause of the incident," Exxon
spokesperson Alan Jeffers told Reuters.
The accident has left evacuated residents seeking shelter
elsewhere. "Basically if it doesn't fit in our car we don't
have it right now," local resident Ryan Senia said. He had
previously listed his home for sale, but said the spill has
forced him to take it off the market.
The spill totaled upwards of 10,000 barrels, according to an
ExxonMobil press release. So far, about 12,000 barrels of oil and
water have reportedly been recovered. The company has deployed 15
vacuum trucks, 33 storage tanks and 120 workers to the cleanup
site.
"There are literally hundreds of cleanup crew people in our
area...no one has a definite time frame on how long they will be
here, but some people are saying months," Harrell said.
A 3,600-foot boom was also installed near Lake Conway, and an
approximately 51-centimeter pipeline was shut down to prevent the
spilled oil from reaching the water. So far, no oil has reached
the lake.
The cause of the spill is being investigated, and cleanup
operations are being coordinated with the Department of Emergency
Management and other local authorities.
The Heavy Crude that the Pegasus Pipeline was carrying at the
time needs to be blended with lighter oils or natural gas liquids
in order to flow through, and some environmentalists suspect that
this type of oil sand crude is more corrosive to pipelines. Exxon
was fined in 2010 for not inspecting another portion of the
Pegasus line with sufficient frequency.
Meanwhile, the community is anxious to see how the oil giant
plans to handle the situation: "The major concern for many
people in our neighborhood is the long-term impact, both
environmentally and financially. For example, what is this going
to do to our property values?" Harrell said. He added that
many local residents are angry, and were not aware that the
pipeline ran through the area.
Richard Steiner, an environmental consultant for Oasis Earth,
spoke with RT Monday to describe the ecological and possible
political ramifications of the Arkansas oil spill. He blamed a
lack of responsibility among US safety regulators who allowed the
Pegasus pipeline to remain in operation for over 50 years.
"There’s no excuse whatsoever for oil pipelines to be
anything over 30 years old,” he said. “Their general
design life is maybe 20-30 years old. The federal administration
within the Department of Transportation in the US – the pipeline
and hazardous material safety administration – isn’t doing its
job. Nor is industry. There’s a general complacency within
industry and government that says, ‘Look, don’t worry we’ve got
this. You should just be happy. We know how to do this work. Stay
out of our business.’ But this happens time and time and time and
again. It just goes to show you people make mistakes."
Local media reported that journalists were barred from entering
the site for over 30 hours following the disaster.

Keystone Pipeline
The leak comes amid growing opposition to the controversial
Keystone XL project, which would see an oil pipeline run across
the US Midwest. TransCanada Corp.'s plan to pipe Alberta oil
sands to the US Gulf Coast has been met with criticism over the
possible environmental impact.
The project has been embroiled in ongoing controversy. Project
supporters have worked to persuade the US to approve the
$7-billion project, arguing that the Keystone XL would create
thousands of new jobs and free the country from energy dependence
on South American exporters such as Venezuela.
Though, according to Christopher Williams, an environmental
activist and professor at Pace University who spoke with RT on
Monday , Keystone has "nothing to do with reducing gasoline
costs in the United States -- most of that oil is to be exported,
it's not for US consumption. So, this is very much a bonanza for
the oil companies, and a disaster for North Americans."
Environmentalists have expressed concerns over the pollution
risks inherent to the controversial tar sands method of oil
production. Even the US State Department admits the Keystone
project will create "numerous" and
"substantial" impacts on the environment.
In a March draft environmental impact statement, the US said that
the Canadian synthetic crude oil the pipeline is slated to
transport into the US produces 17 per cent more greenhouse gases
than natural crude oil already refined there. It also said that
the construction phase of the project would result in carbon
dioxide emissions equivalent to about 626,000 passenger vehicles
operating for one year.
The report also said the pipeline could disturb highly erodible
soil, degrade streams, encroach on habitats of federally
protected species, and be susceptible to potentially disastrous
leaks and spills.
But despite its environmental toll, the US says the Keystone
pipeline it is still a better option than proposed alternatives
which are “not reasonable.”
President Barack Obama will have the final say on the project,
which has been pending for more than four years, as environmental
activists battle to kill it.

Last week, the US Department of Transportation fined ExxonMobil
Corporation $1.7 million over pipeline safety violations in the
2011 Yellowstone River oil spill. The claim alleged that the
company did not respond quickly enough, and that there was a
“known threat,” according to the US Pipeline Safety
Administration. The spill leaked about 63,000 gallons of crude
oil into the Montana River, and caused massive flooding.

Cant blame Canadiens but can sure blame CanGov. Harper regime is ruining this country; and yours! I hope this makes opposition to the XL Pipeline even stronger and the Obama Government tells Harper where to shove his pipeline! Don't let him destroy your country and continue to rape ours! Selling our oil at bargain basement prices and not caring about the destruction along the way
