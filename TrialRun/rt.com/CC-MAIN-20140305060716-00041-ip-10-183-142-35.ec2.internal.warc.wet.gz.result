Corruption, Court, Crime, Law, Police, Shooting, USA The Dallas Police Department has announced that the officer who shot a mentally ill man, an event that was caught on video, has lost his job and it will be up to a grand jury to decide whether he is charged with a felony.
Officer Cardan Spencer claimed last week that he shot Bobby
Gerald Bennett, a 52-year-old man suffering from bipolar disorder
and schizophrenia, only when Bennett made an effort to attack
Spencer and another officer with a knife. Yet video captured by a
neighbor’s surveillance camera clearly shows that Bennett was
standing yards away from the police when Spencer opened fire,
hitting the man in the abdomen.
Police Chief David Brown said in a press conference Thursday that
Spencer had been fired, an announcement that came after video of
the October 14 incident played throughout US media outlets. Brown
also said that Spencer would be charged with felony aggravated
assault, but was forced to retract that claim when a federal
judge refused to sign an arrest warrant.
Bennett survived the incident but remains hospitalized and in
stable condition more than a week later. His family said he was
off his medication and pacing in the street, so they called
police in an attempt to resolve the situation.
“I had a conversation with him, told him to chill out and be
cool,” neighbor Maurice Bunch told CBS of his conversation
with Bennett before the police arrived. “Out of nowhere they
just opened fire on him. I’ve never seen anything like it in my
life. He never approached them, he never came at them in any
threatening manner.”
Bennett himself was originally charged with aggravated assault
with a deadly weapon on a public servant but the police have said
that charge will be dropped.
Despite Brown’s highly publicized announcement Thursday,
Spencer’s attorney said that his client has yet to be arrested or
charged at all.
Dallas Police association President Ron Pinkston said a district
judge refused to sign the arrest warrant charging Spencer with
aggravated assault, which could be punishable with a 20 year
prison term.
“It tells me that there’s questions about this
investigation,” Pinkston told the Dallas News. “Anybody
involved knows (this investigation) was pushed through for
political and media reasons… How come all investigations aren’t
done in nine days?” Spencer’s partner Christopher Watson wrote in the police report
after the incident that Bennett yelled, “You all are gonna
need more officers than this!” He also claimed the situation
“escalated, which led an officer to fire his weapon upon the
individual,” a claim that seems to be contradicted by the
video.
At least four shots were fired, and Bennett’s mother told
reporters she was under the impression that experienced mental
health professionals would respond to her call. Yet Spencer’s
lawyer told WFAA-TV in Dallas that his client was guilty of no
wrongdoing.
“The facts and circumstances known to Officer Spencer at the
time completely justify his actions,” attorney Robert Rogers
said. “Obviously there is much more to this situation than
that video.”
The uncertainty seems unlikely to calm a community outraged by
the video and perception of police malfeasance.
“What happened 10 days ago should have never happened in the
first place, and I want to make sure it never happens again,”
Bennett family attorney George Miler. “I don’t see how
[Spencer] could not be charged with a crime,” adding that the
police shot Bennett in “cold blood.”

A few days ago, several cops openly brandishing pistols not holstered, and a couple of shotguns came into my building. I found out later that it was a "domestic" dispute between two unarmed people. These guys acted as though they were planning to retake the Alamo. 0

R asks, "What comes next?" We bring the madness and cruelty to the rest of the world, of course.

Lamotte Cason is a homophobe. He is very active on a Facebook page called Heterosexual Awareness Month. Very bigoted behavior for someone pointing out the injustice of others! 0
