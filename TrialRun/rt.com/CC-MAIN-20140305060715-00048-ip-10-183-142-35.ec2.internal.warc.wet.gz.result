Clashes, Politics, Protest, Turkey Riot police have fired volleys of tear gas as thousands of protesters are trying to reclaim Taksim after being forced out in fierce clashes with law enforcement. Thick smoke blankets the square.
Turkish riot police are driving thousands into narrow side
streets, Reuters report citing witnesses, with water cannon
vehicles advanced across the square. Struggling to disperse the
crowd, riot police water- cannoned a disabled protester who
was unable to leave Taksim. Barrage of gas being fired. About one canister every three
seconds at the moment.

Prior to that, protesters, mocking and calling for police to
leave, confronted the forces. Follow
RT's live updates on the Turkish protests.
Some of protesters are burning colorful flares and fireworks.
Fire could be seen in a few locations across the square with the
chaos raging at the cradle of the two-week long anti-government
protest.

Chanting slogans and launching fireworks in defiance, tens of
thousands eventually fled the square, according to witnesses, to
Gezi Park, where tear gas canisters have also been fired.
However, shortly after, Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu
said Taksim Square has been 'cleansed', riot police and
protesters returned to Taksim with more tear gas and water cannon
on site. "We will continue our measures in an unremitting manner,
whether day or night, until marginal elements are cleared and the
square is open to the people," he said in a televised
announcement.

Meanwhile, Mutlu has said police will continue operations in
Taksim Square, day and night, until it is cleared, Reuters
reported.
Earlier Tuesday, police and protesters clashed over a new barrier
inside the square. Hundreds of police took over Taksim Square, using tear gas and
water cannon to oust the few protesters present there in the
morning. The raid allowed the removal of barricades and banners. PM Erdogan
praised the troops for removing the ‘rags’ as he's branded the
revolutionary symbols. At least 18 people were injured in Tuesday's violence, medical
officials said, reporting numerous broken bones and several head
injuries, AFP reports. An RT Spanish correspondent was in the midst of the action, doing
a live report, she was also caught in the crossfire and hit by tear gas.
Following the
crackdown, protesters said they have lost faith in the prospect
of dialogue with Erdogan, who hours before said he would meet
with protest leaders on Wednesday.
Also on Tuesday some 30 to 70 lawyers protesting against the
handling of the protest were reportedly detained in front of a
courtroom in Istanbul. Professor Huse-yin Bagchi - from the Middle East Technical
University in Ankara, told RT that a further escalation of the
crisis in Turkey could lead to an all-out civil war. But he also
said that it has always been in Erdogan's power to deflate the
situation.
“I think it is wrong to bring one part of society against
another part of society. In the end it can only lead to civil
war”, Bagchi said. “There is a new social movement in
Turkey. He has to talk to young people, meet the demands of young
people. Otherwise there will be more confrontation, more unrest
and more death in the coming days.”
Sharing his predictions for the following days, a young
protester, Deniz Can Akkaya, explained that the government had
broken a promise made only several hours earlier about not
removing the barricades at Taksim. They had come back with full
force a few hours later, trying to remove the protesters as well.
But, as Akkaya explains - a Wednesday meeting between the PM and
an Occupy Gezi representation group should yield some concrete
solutions as to how to move forward.
“The PM is due to meet with a representation group in Gezi Park.
Three were certain demands that the protesters put on the table.
The government will discuss whether it’s possible for them to be
met and what kind of concessions they’re willing to make. The
meeting should be a turning point.”
The news keeps coming in as protests on the capital Ankara's
streets are continuing as well. On Monday night, the police had
stepped up their tactics to tear gas. As they swarmed the popular
Tunali Hilmi Street, shop keepers and restaurant owners, together
with their clientele, were shutting themselves in to escape the
gas. There are continuing witness reports of violence continuing
in the capital.
