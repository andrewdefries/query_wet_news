Bitcoin, Breakaway regions, Currencies, Economy, Law, Oil, Politics, Resources, UK Scotland has oil, it’s small and can adopt the same regulatory measures as Singapore or Switzerland. That’s everything it needs to eventually join the list of the richest nations of the world, Dominic Frisby, author of ‘Life After the State’, told RT.
“Scotland has the oil, it’s small, its population is less
than 5 million and it has the same record. It has the opportunity
to install the same regulatory and legislative [measures], to
take the same options as Singapore or Switzerland. No other
country in the world has the triple: the oil, regulatory issues
and the fact that it is small,” Frisby told RT's Max Keiser
on his show, the Keiser Report.
While writing his book “Life After the State,” Frisby researched
the list of the richest nations in the world based on GDP per
capita. He explains that some of the states got onto the list
because of their huge oil stocks, others due to their favorable
regulatory legislation, but all of them have something in common
– they are relatively small in size.
“In first place it’s Qatar, in second place it’s Luxemburg,
and then you have the likes of Switzerland, Norway, Singapore,
Hong Kong (that counts as a country on those lists), Brunei, etc.
Some of these countries have got rich because of their oil. But
in that case, why isn’t there Saudi Arabia on the list? Why isn’t
Russia or Venezuela? Saudi Arabia is, by the way, 28th. Some of
the countries have got there because of their oil, some because
of the favorable legislation regulation, which means people
either want to base themselves there or operate out of there,
they are very tax-friendly. But these are regulatory and
legislative options that are available to other countries in the
world, they just haven’t been adopted,” Frisby said.
“The one thing all these countries on the list have in common
is that they are small. They all have populations below 5
million, only Switzerland has above 7 million people, with the
exception of the US which is at the 7th or 8th position. But in
1950-1970 the US topped that list, but as its state has grown and
government has become more centralized, the US has slipped,”
Frisby said.
Frisby argues that Scotland combines all the necessary
characteristics to become one of the richest countries in the
world. Moreover, Scotland has “a huge history in finance and
banking,” he said.
Talking about the advantages and disadvantages of keeping the
British pound, if Scotland votes for independence in a referendum
in September, Frisby said that would be “the dumbest decision
that Scotland will make.”
“It will be exactly the same dynamic of Southern Europe that
Greece faces. You have interest rates set in Westminster that
suit London and England in the same way the interest rates set in
Brussels suit Germany, and then in the process Greece or Spain
have been absolutely annihilated by that. The same thing could
happen to Scotland. If it is going to be independent, be
independent. They have to learn to live off their tax base as
well,” Frisby told Max Keiser.
Frisby said that he favors crypto-currencies such as bitcoin,
stating that “technology of electronic cash is infinitely
superior” and it’s pretty obvious that that’s the way money is
going.
“Here is Scotland with an opportunity to be the trailblazer
and be the first government to use cryptocurrency. Well,
Icelanders are already doing that now,” Frisby said.

Scotland will split from the UK about the same time quebec splits from Canada. They're all a bunch of whiners and figure that if they make enough noise they'll get their greasy pockets filled with free haggis for stickin around, which was the plan all along.

Scotland needs public, not private banking, like North Dakota. The interest paid goes to the government, not Wall Street, and reduce taxes and provides infrastructural at half price. -1
