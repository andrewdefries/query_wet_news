Canada, Europe, Natural disasters, USA, Weather Over a million homes and businesses without power, holiday plans destroyed over flight cancelations – that’s how Christmas panned out for some people across the globe, as deadly storms swept the planet.
The disaster is expected to carry on at least for a few more
days.
In the UK, stormy weather has killed five people since Monday.
150,000 homes were left without electricity. Scotland and
Northern Ireland are also due to be hit by powerful winds of 140
kilometers per hour.
Weather and flood warnings have been issued across the country,
leading to hazardous driving conditions.
A power cut at the North Terminal of London’s Gatwick airport
caused flight cancelations, before all flights were transferred
to the South Terminal.
"I'm across plans to get electricity to many without power.
My thoughts are with them and those facing travel problems this
Christmas Eve," British prime Minister David Cameron
tweeted.

In Belgium, winds reached 100 kilometers per hour. Traffic was
disrupted in the capital Brussels, after uprooted trees crashed
through power cables.
A teenager has died in Normandy in France, following a wall
collapse at a building site. Extremely strong winds and
torrential rain hit the country, especially in Brittany and
Normandy.
Naval authorities also reported a Russian sailor missing after
having been flown off board a vessel off the coast of Brest in
Brittany, according to Reuters.
120,000 homes across France are experiencing a power blackout due
to the disaster, according to Le Nouvel Observateur media outlet.
In the south of France, the situation isn’t any better: a ski
resort at La Pierre Saint Martin was closed over the dangerous
weather conditions, its manager, Dominique Rousseau, told
Euronews.
The international airport at Nice was closed down, with all
incoming and outgoing flights canceled until at least 12.00 GMT,
due to poor visibility on the runway, a spokesman said as quoted
by Reuters.
Heavy downpours also caused cancellations of rail, flight and
ferry services.
The storm largely subsided in the north of France on Wednesday,
but continued to batter southeastern France and the Mediterranean
coastline.
Moving further south in Europe: in Spanish airports such as
Bilbau, Asturias, Santander and Vigo, flights are being canceled.
Red alerts – the most dangerous possible - have been issued in
two districts in Portugal, while another 15 districts are under
orange alert, the second highest level.
Authorities have also warned the population to stay away from the
coast until Thursday, with waves expected to reach seven meters.
Portugal is also experiencing major power cuts, with the
electricity supplier EDP saying that 1,000 of its staff are
currently carrying out emergency works in north and central areas
of the country.
Across the Atlantic, 14 people have been killed in ice and snow
storms that battered central, northeastern US, and Canada.
Over 500,000 homes and businesses have experienced a major power
blackout in the US. Power provider, Consumers Energy, based in
Jackson, Michigan, told AP that the area hasn’t seen so many
storms since the company’s founding 126 years ago. About 17
percent (over 300,000) of all customers lost power on Saturday,
and half remained without power on Tuesday.
More snow is expected to hit the US, as the storm is moving into
the Great Lakes region and Midwest on Wednesday.
US authorities are keeping emergency shelters open for those who
have experienced a power blackout in their home.
In Canada two people died from carbon monoxide poisoning after
using a gas generator to heat their home northeast of Toronto,
Ontario, after a power blackout.
90,000 homes were without power in Toronto, according to the
authorities, as quoted by AP.

Late 60s America places deep sea buoys into all of the worlds oceans , they say its to try to work out climate change /global warming is affecting the planet !
1969 the american gov bring out the vehicle emissions legislation that spurns a multi billion $ industry .
There were reports that US Airforce planes were seen be towing a craft behind them and some people reported that they were towing ironisers in an attempt to creat a weather patten .
\well they have got the people used to the domestic drones now so they dont need to tow the units around anymore !
They will kill us all in the end !
