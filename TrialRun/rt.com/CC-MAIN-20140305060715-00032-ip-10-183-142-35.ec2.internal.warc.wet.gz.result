Is the battle of ‘overflights’ the opening salvo of the growing competition for the Pacific pitting China against the US? Is the American pivot to Asia merely militarizing the region? Can Washington accept that China will eventually become the regional hegemon? And what would an American-Chinese compromise look like? CrossTalking with John Feffer and Martin McCauley.

Communist China´s Soft economic power has everyone on the Brain Train, YES notice few very few use THE PEOPLE´s Republic of China or COMMUNIST CHINA. Dropping that prefix, makes You feel OK about Communist China, You see few thought that Capitalism can do without democracry; WELL COMMUNIST CHINA CAPITALISM. Democracy is not important to labor cost, APPLE suicides in Communist China are DAILY. CORPORATE GREED is GLOBAL kills GLOBALLY. REMEMBER it is Communist CHINA ALWAYS.

Russia is just a Chinese puppet these days, how sad. They must be so proud.

China is fully entitled to define its territorial borders to clarify the situation since Japan escalated this crisis by the sale of islands to the Japanese government. The Okinawan Islands were returned to Japan in a deal in 1971 with no mention of the disputed islands; with no consultation with China. The islands in dispute are in fact just off the coast of Taiwan. China is no mood to take history lessons from Japan. Even South Korea shows a lack of trust in Japan today as their leader refuses to meet the Prime Minister of Japan based on historical disagreements. Japan shows itself to be uncompromising and confused. 0
