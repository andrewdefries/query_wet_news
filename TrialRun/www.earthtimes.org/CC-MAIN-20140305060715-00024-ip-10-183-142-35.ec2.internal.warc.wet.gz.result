Aircraft company on target with pioneering technology | Business | The Earth Times
Home Business Climate Conservation Energy Health Nature Politics Pollution SciTech Going Green Bombardier on target with pioneering technology
By John Dean - 10 Nov 2010 11:22:0 GMT
Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier is pressing ahead with construction of a new wing which promises to make flight more environmentally-friendly.
Work being done by the company in Montreal, Canada, and Belfast, in Northern Ireland, centres around the use of composite materials which make wings lighter.
Composite technology is playing an increasingly important in aircraft manufacture using materials such as carbon fibre. Lighter planes use considerably less fuel.
Bombardier has now completed the first phase of construction of the 55,742 m2 facility in Belfast that will house the manufacture and assembly of the wings for the company's new CSeries commercial aircraft.
As part of the programme, Bombardier's Belfast operation has also developed a Resin Transfer Infusion (RTI) technology to manufacture the large one-piece wing skins and structural spars for the wing torque box. It has already manufactured and assembled a demonstrator wing, which has been successfully tested.
Michael Ryan, Vice President and General Manager, Bombardier Aerospace, Belfast, said: "We are progressing with the composite wing development and test programme as planned, and look forward to starting production of the CSeries aircraft wing early next year."
In Montreal, the product development team at Bombardier's St-Laurent manufacturing complex has successfully joined an advanced composite wing portion to a composite wing box.
Benjamin Boehm, Vice President, Programs, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft, said: "The test joining of the outer wing portion to the centre wing box is a significant milestone during the detail design phase of the CSeries aircraft programme."
Since the CSeries aircraft programme was announced at the Farnborough Airshow in the UK in 2008, Bombardier has recorded orders from Deutsche Lufthansa, Lease Corporation International and Republic Airways for 33 CS100 and 57 CS300 aircraft. Options have been placed on an additional 90 CSeries aircraft.
The company has also been experimenting with fuel from an oil seed crop. The project involves a Bombardier Q400 aircraft and a six-partner consortium based in Canada. Tom Todaro, President of Targeted Growth Canada, the Saskatchewan organisation leading the consortium, said: "There's no doubt that biotechnology will play a key role in developing long-term sustainable and low-carbon fuel sources."

Rio+20 - Success or Failure | Business | The Earth Times
Home Business Climate Conservation Energy Health Nature Politics Pollution SciTech Going Green Rio+20 - Success or Failure
By Michael Evans - 02 Jul 2012 9:47:9 GMT
Success or Failure? - Rio+20 Logo
The Rio+20 Earth Summit has now been and gone. It had been billed as a "once in a generation chance" to turn the global economy onto a sustainable track. 50,000 people attended, including 100 heads of state, but noticeably not US President Barack Obama or UK Prime Minister David Cameron.
Ten priorities for a planet in peril were identified:
Deforestation. Deforestation and forest degradation produces 10% of the world's carbon emissions and Brazil has the largest area of rainforest in the world. Although there has been a reduction in Brazilian deforestation, efforts to connect avoided deforestation to a global carbon deal have foundered.
Population. The world's 7 billionth person was born last year and by the middle of the century the world's population is predicted to reach 9 billion. This rise could swamp any efforts made to protect the planet, but in recent years population control has been seen to be to coercive and controversial.
Endangered species. On the whole, human beings are healthier and wealthier than ever before, but nearly everything else that lives on the planet is not and there has been little concerted effort internationally to deal with this.
Climate Change. Global warming is the most significant environmental threat. Global carbon emissions keep rising and there has been no international agreement on how these emissions should be reduced.
World Hunger. Although famine is increasingly a thing of the past, 925 million people in the world still go hungry. It is anticipated that by 2050 the world may need to produce twice as much food as it does now.
Water Scarcity. Approximately one in nine people in the world lack access to a pure water supply. This can lead to preventable disease and reduced agricultural yield. There is plenty of water for everyone, but fresh water supplies are threatened by pollution, overuse and drought caused by climate change.
Global Poverty. The single biggest contributor to ill health is poverty. In the last 20 years global poverty has significantly fallen, but many countries still lag behind.
Renewable Energy. Although renewable energy resources are growing at a rate of 18% per year, they still only produce 3% of the world's energy supply. Germany leads the way and plans to go 100% renewable by 2050.
Oceans. Oceans cover 75% of the earth's surface and are valuable to human life, but are in great danger from pollution, overfishing and climate change. This has been largely ignored, but Australia has recently announced that it is to create the world's largest marine reserve.
Air Pollution. According to the World Health Organisation, 1.3 million people die each year as a result of outside air pollution. This is a particular problem in developing nations like China where much of the pollution is due to the burning of coal.
As with such conferences in the past, many fine words were spoken that led to a final statement, "The Future We Want". This consisted of 253 paragraphs of affirmations and entreaties, but in truth all it added up to was little more than a plea for something better.
Barbara Stocking, chief executive of OXFAM GB told the BBC that although the UN hope for the conference had been to turn the global economy onto a sustainable track, the leaders of the world "really did not take decisions that will take us forward".
The executive director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo went even further. Quoted in Time Magazine, he described the conference as "a failure of epic proportions" and the final statement as being "the longest suicide note in history".
Of course, one can't help reflecting that if world leaders find it impossible to agree on solutions to the violence in Syria or the European financial crisis, what hope is there in getting any agreement on world environmental issues, particularly since a number of the major players did not even attend the conference.
So where does that leave us? Danish economist Bjorn Lomborg feels that with no unified agreement, it would be more appropriate for some of the attention and money that is currently being directed to climate change to be directed towards some of the environmental threats that are killing people right now. Major areas cited are provision of clean water, improved sanitation and reducing threats from air pollution.
Others compare this line of thinking as being rather like straightening the pictures while the house burns down, but one thing is clear and that is that top-down solving of the world's problems is no longer an option.
The only hope of any form of co-ordination now seems to lie with the international business community. The president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), Peter Bakker, believes that the corporate sector offers the best opportunity for saving the world. He believes that local coalitions in individual countries or cities are the answer. He calls these "coalitions of the willing".
The challenge will be persuading investors that foregoing some of their profit can make a major contribution to saving the world.
