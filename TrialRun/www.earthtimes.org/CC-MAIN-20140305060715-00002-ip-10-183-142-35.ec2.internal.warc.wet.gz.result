Canada moves on Utah's tar sands	Posted Mon, 24 Feb 2014 07:35:00 GMT by Colin Ricketts
We have written on the disaster that is tar sand waste, but now several more problems are being noticed, when, to be honest, they should have been included in a thorough investigation on these processes before they were initiated. Canada moves on Utah's tar sands	To bee or not to bee (again)

When will the bees and other helpful insects be protected in the same way as (some) mammals and birds? It's obvious that the fruit industries will collapse without them, so for the most selfish of reasons, we know we have to try and preserve these species. Unfortunately, there are always those who suffer from short sight, or simply greed for bigger and bigger short-term profits.To bee or not to bee (again)
The worst of climate change conferences?
Posted Sat, 16 Nov 2013 12:45:00 GMT by JW Dowey
Is the incredible damage and loss of life in the Philippines linked to more severe storms as our climate changes? Credibility of any detractors seems lacking, as we wait for even more signals that we need to construct strong solutions at Warsaw, and not wait until Paris in 2015.The worst of climate change conferences?
Pet coke expands, and pollutes everywhere
Posted Tue, 22 Oct 2013 06:25:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong
When nations export their fossil fuels, it is normally impossible to prescribe how much carbon dioxide (and the rest) will be released, stored or 'mitigated'. In this case, though, we should not be simply hiding our heads in the tar sand. Pet coke expands, and pollutes everywhere
Air quality study with benefits

We must have a look at western cities and their special problems before we begin criticising the admittedly awful pollution that surrounds some other urban and deforested areas. The European Environmental Agency takes great care to remind us of their problems. Air quality study with benefits
Less carbon reduction and more pollution = global warming

A debate from Britain on the European predicaments on emissions control. Climate change is guaranteed. How soon can we negotiate a way to get people to act and changing our predicament? Less carbon reduction and more pollution = global warming

Greening our oceans?
After the World Ocean Summit, the long term future is not assured. We can hope that the more positive nations move on aggressively, to combat those people and industries who would violently continue their unthinking habits. Some fishing and eating habits became obsolete when so many species, great and small, started to disappear Fantastic ancient fauna precedes mammal evolution
Animals of unfamiliar as well as familiar types took up niches in the ancient ecosystems, as birds and mammals developed and, of course, feathered dinosaurs ruled the roost! World Ocean Summit Report 2014
How can we protect our coastal, oceanic and even little seas. As we don't often travel on water nowadays, we need to figure just how 'successful' our various pollutions, fish consumptions and farming and of course the limited conservation efforts have been.
