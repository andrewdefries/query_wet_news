Greening our oceans?
Posted Thu, 06 Mar 2014 12:09:00 GMT by Colin Ricketts
After the World Ocean Summit, the long term future is not assured. We can hope that the more positive nations move on aggressively, to combat those people and industries who would violently continue their unthinking habits. Some fishing and eating habits became obsolete when so many species, great and small, started to disappear Greening our oceans?
Fantastic ancient fauna precedes mammal evolution
Posted Wed, 05 Mar 2014 16:50:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong
Animals of unfamiliar as well as familiar types took up niches in the ancient ecosystems, as birds and mammals developed and, of course, feathered dinosaurs ruled the roost! Fantastic ancient fauna precedes mammal evolution
World Ocean Summit Report 2014
Posted Tue, 04 Mar 2014 07:50:00 GMT by JW Dowey
How can we protect our coastal, oceanic and even little seas. As we don't often travel on water nowadays, we need to figure just how 'successful' our various pollutions, fish consumptions and farming and of course the limited conservation efforts have been.World Ocean Summit Report 2014
Pathogens find new hosts as Arctic ice melts
Posted Sat, 01 Mar 2014 07:20:01 GMT by Julie Cook
We have heard a lot about the release of bacteria and other pathogens while ice is no longer containing them in the Arctic. Here is the American Association for the Advancement of Science in their latest Chicago briefing.Pathogens find new hosts as Arctic ice melts
Wind turbines save your city
Posted Thu, 27 Feb 2014 07:55:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong
Some nations have disregarded wind turbines as an energy source, until now. The added advantage of a protective function against all storms would gain lots of political clout in certain cities we know! Wind turbines save your city
Skin cancer selected our ancestors?
Posted Wed, 26 Feb 2014 07:40:00 GMT by Paul Robinson
We can't find the fossils and the genome can give only some hints. How did the first human-like species survive and why did they have to be black. Mel Greaves has the answers. Skin cancer selected our ancestors?
Simply red (squirrel) is better
Posted Tue, 25 Feb 2014 07:38:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong
We struggle against invasive species, but sometimes research helps to finally understand what can be done to preserve the status quo. The red squirrel is healthy in Europe and in Scotland, but where pine forests are less common and the greys virus can strike, none remain. Simply red (squirrel) is better
Canada moves on Utah's tar sands	Posted Mon, 24 Feb 2014 07:35:00 GMT by Colin Ricketts
We have written on the disaster that is tar sand waste, but now several more problems are being noticed, when, to be honest, they should have been included in a thorough investigation on these processes before they were initiated. Canada moves on Utah's tar sands	Condors are in California, but for how long?
Posted Fri, 21 Feb 2014 14:29:00 GMT by JW Dowey
They used to rule the roost and the skies in North America, with even bigger species of Gymnogyps flying until recently. Now the Californian condors are finding it difficult to eke an existence while they are being poisoned by lead from bullets fired by ranchers, poachers and hunters.Condors are in California, but for how long?

Dump fracking or integrate it?
Posted Thu, 13 Feb 2014 15:06:20 GMT by Colin Ricketts
One of the few frackers in Western Europe, will the UK, go ahead with its risky programme of hydraulic fracturing? Many other nations have banned it completely because of its geological and high-carbon reputation.Dump fracking or integrate it?
Trees-the solution to flooding?
Posted Wed, 12 Feb 2014 07:36:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong
Wilding can mean the bears and wolves and lions of previous millennia returning to our neighbourhood. It also refers to more vegetative matters. The trees and other producers here are also the water retainers for any watershed. Without bogs and forests, the run-off from rain travels quickly off the land and floods both highland and lowland.Trees-the solution to flooding?
Save the Congo chimpanzee!
Posted Tue, 11 Feb 2014 08:49:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong
With discovery comes responsibility. At least we dont face extinction yet for the chimpanzee. These last great discoveries of the polluting era are important in that we can still recover the situation for many species, some of them on their last legs. In the case of our closest relative, we need to motivate, to work hard and even fight to the death for the result that is imperative.Save the Congo chimpanzee!
Interesting albatross personalities
Posted Sun, 09 Feb 2014 07:55:00 GMT by Paul Robinson
Far away in the Antarctic, life for the albatross is hard. Fishing vessels are sources of food, but the prime fishing is found in productive shallow seas near islands. The personalities of these birds have always been intriguing, and now we have a start on discovering more about their lives.Interesting albatross personalities
EU moves on renewable energy
Posted Thu, 06 Feb 2014 10:27:00 GMT by Dave Armstrong
Wind and solar energy are beginning to take over in parts of Europe that are not importing low-cost fossil fuels. The green light is especially bright after a vote yesterday in the EU. This could light the way for vast technological improvement, and a healthy future.EU moves on renewable energy
Costing 21st Century coastal flooding
Posted Wed, 05 Feb 2014 14:16:00 GMT by JW Dowey
The carbon dioxide connection is finally obvious. Now we need to look ahead and prepare for the inevitable flooding that will happen as this last decade is followed by even quicker sea-level rise. Costing 21st Century coastal flooding
Chitwan shines, but the railway threatens
Posted Wed, 05 Feb 2014 07:31:00 GMT by JW Dowey
International pressure on African, South American and now Asian nations is growing so that we can retain the prime heritage of biodiverse reserves within each country. Without them, the future is bleak for both species and the industry that relies on natural resources being kept in place. It is simply foolish to destroy what you have for short-term gains. There is a future that has to be considered-something we have rarely done in the past.Chitwan shines, but the railway threatens
Hawaiian rise in endangered species
Posted Tue, 04 Feb 2014 15:11:00 GMT by Paul Robinson
We need technology to discover where and how endangered species survive. The US government have just declared 15 more Hawaiian species as endangered, but the islands have so many, it is difficult to see how they can all be conserved.Hawaiian rise in endangered species
