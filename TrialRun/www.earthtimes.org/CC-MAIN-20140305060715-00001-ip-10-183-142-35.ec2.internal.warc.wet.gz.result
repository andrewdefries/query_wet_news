New tool picks out smoke-hazard in atmosphere
Posted Mon, 16 May 2011 19:01:00 GMT by Martin Leggett
A customized tool for picking up on very low levels of noxious burning byproducts has enabled NOAA scientists to sniff out isocyanic acid - a chemical linked to known health problems - in LA smog and wildfire smoke. This compound is though likely to be at worryingly high levels in cigarette smoke, as well as homes using poorly-drafted wood fires, and may increase as the planet hots up, says the paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.New tool picks out smoke-hazard in atmosphere

Methane-contaminated drinking water confirmed near fracking wells
Posted Mon, 09 May 2011 19:00:00 GMT by Martin Leggett
The drinking water of homes close to wells that use hydraulic fracturing - to help get gas from buried shales - has up to 17 times the level of methane of those further away, says new research published in today's online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Scientists from Duke University have pinned the methane in tap water to the gas wells themselves, adding to an already long list of environmental concerns with shale gas 'fracking'.

Foot-and-mouth infectious for less time - raising hopes for binning culls
Posted Thu, 05 May 2011 18:00:00 GMT by Martin Leggett
Important new research into the infectiousness of foot-and-mouth disease, published in Science tomorrow, shows that the livestock virus can only be passed-on for half the time previously thought. That makes less destructive disease management approaches much more viable, and could help relegate the wholesale livestock slaughter of 'preemptive culling' to the grim pages of history.Foot-and-mouth infectious for less time - raising hopes for binning culls
