Secret Addiction in Taconic Crash? It's Possible
Aug. 8, 2009
Page 2 of 3
"Growing Pains" star Tracey Gold has admitted on "Oprah" that she drank and drove nearly five years ago. Gold lost control of her SUV in Ventura, Calif., veered off the freeway, rolled over several times down an embankment, injuring her husband and two of her three kids.
"I made a horrible, horrible, horrible choice that evening," she said on the show. "I can't even explain what that feeling is like to see that the people you love the most that you're responsible for this. It's a horrific, horrifying moment."
Gold has since dealt with her issues with alcohol; Diana's treatment is off to a strong start.
"It's hope that I'm going to take the steps," Diana said. "It's one big step and then maybe tiny steps, and I'm going to be healthy again, and that's what I want."
Diane Schuler's family and lawyer have continued to say they are baffled about what happened.
Schuler was driving home to West Babylon, N.Y., from an upstate campground with her two children and three nieces in the car when she crashed on the Taconic in the early afternoon of July 26. After dodging oncoming cars for 1.7 miles, she slammed into an SUV. Her minivan tumbled down an embankment and burst into flames.
Schuler's 5-year-old son, Brian, survived the crash, but daughter Erin and nieces Alyson, Emma and Katie Hunce were killed, along with three people in another vehicle.
Schuler's blood alcohol level was 0.19, more than twice the legal state limit. The toxicology reports from the Westchester County medical examiner's office showed Schuler had the equivalent of 10 drinks in her stomach and elevated levels of THC, the active chemical in marijuana.
Lawyer Questions Toxicology Findings
Investigators found a broken 1.7 ounce bottle of vodka at the crash scene, but Barbara's private investigator Thomas Ruskin told "GMA" that "we don't know if the vodka bottle was in the car or out of the car," because the car rolled.
Her lawyer also called the official findings into question.
"I don't say that the [toxicology] report is accurate or not accurate," the Schulers' lawyer, Dominic Barbara, told "Good Morning America's" Chris Cuomo Friday. "What I say is that none of this case is logical. This is a woman who leaves a campground at 9 a.m. absolutely sober. ... We have video, we have tapes, we have people we spoke to. She had no alcohol in her system."
The lawyer said that in one of four phone calls made from the Schuler's minivan before the crash, one of the children described her aunt as behaving strangely.
"We now have information about one of the phone calls where the child [in the car] says that her aunt is having problems speaking and seeing. Not slurred, but actually having trouble," Barbara said.
Barbara asked anyone with information about Schuler or the events leading to the crash to contact his investigators at the CMP Group in New York.
"The issue is what happened to this woman and how it happened," Barbara said. "It's not logical to just believe that these events occurred the way they did. It isn't who she was as a person."
Experts don't agree with Barbara's proposition.
"If they found elevated alcohol levels in her blood, she must have ingested it," said Dr. Pierre Fayad, chairman of the University of Nebraska Medical Center Department of Neurological Sciences. "Unfortunately, alcoholism and drug addiction are often missed or underestimated by family members."

Something a man says he did that killed someone else. Abc's linsey davis tells us about the man begging everyone else not to make his mistake. Reporter: With his face pixilated and voice distorted 22-year- old matt cordle makes a startling confession. I killed a man. I ended up going the wrong way down the highway, directly into oncoming traffic. And I struck a car. Reporter: Inside that car was 61-year-old vincent canzani, a photographer, navy submarine vet and father of two. ON JUNE 22nd, 2013, I HIT AND Killed vincent canzani. Reporter: And online his actions are largely being revered with posts like, "well done young man" and "we need more people like this." Though we did find the occasional post like, "never should someone be rewarded for having the guts to admit they committed a wrong by drinking and driving. According to the prosecutors office, on monday, cordle will face a grand jury and up to eight years in prison. The video is also evidence of an increasing fascination with what some might call a confession culture. Just last month a florida man, accused of killing his wife, confessed to the grisly murder on facebook. In cordle's video he holds something called a promise card, part of a social movement dedicated to bettering humanity through the power of a promise. Cordle has already made one promise -- when I get charged, I will plead guilty. Reporter: And he hopes the public will make a promise too. I'm begging you, please don't drink and drive.

A pileup in wisconsin. One car ricochets down the icy highway causing a chain reaction. And that driver in texas who narrowly misses slabs of ice hurdling toward the ground. Abc's extreme weather team is tracking it all tonight and weather editor ginger zee starts us off. Reporter: Tonight, almost the entire nation is in the perilous grip of winter come early. This is unlike anything I've ever seen. Reporter: In california, chilling winds and all the way to new england several ice inspired spinouts. We're going south to new haven. You can see what happened on the northbound side. All that ice on top of the trees, the road and a huge back-up. Over the weekend deadly collision. Near milwaukee, wisconsin, watch this traffic camera catching the entire pileup, car after car crashing into each other. In new york, a mangled mess. It's like a hockey rink right now. Reporter: In texas, the inches of ice that kept david daugherty, his wife and toddler stuck in the car for 26 hours. I have been sitting in the same spot. I have not moved one foot from exit 380 in 11 hours. I've tried calling the police department. I've tried calling everybody and I can't hardly get anyone to answer the phone. Reporter: Officials telling us they were simply overwhelmed by the ice. If you find yourself stuck in your car here are some tips that could save your life. Make sure your tail pipe can't covered in snow. Finally, stay in your car, don't go wandering. It is your best protection. Idling uses about half a gallon of gas an hour so a 15 gallon tank could last up to 30 hours but run your engine only long enough to remove the chill. Idling too long could lead to fumes in the car. It wasn't all just on the road. In texas look at these wild sheets of ice flying off the top of a building. Tonight in chicago, the bundling has begun in soldier field. You name it, we have it. Reporter: They'll need it. Temperatures in the teens, wind chill near zero, mother nature challenging us all with quite the offense. Another storm to talk about. Let's get straight to the map. This is for the overnight early morning. Going to be a mess for parts of the mid-atlantic and northeast. We're talking some two to four inches for a lot of folks. Washington d.C. When you are going to work, philadelphia, new york, it's going to start building through the morning and early afternoon. That's just the beginning of it. That cold behind. You saw that forecast in chicago. Hydrate, avoid the caffeine and alcohol and chug water. Diane? Thanks so much ginger and of This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

After working together on their beloved "Before Sunrise" trilogy over the course of 18 years, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy say their working relationship is a lot like a marriage, except for one important detail.
