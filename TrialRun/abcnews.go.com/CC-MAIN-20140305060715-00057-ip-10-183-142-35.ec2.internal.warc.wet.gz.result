To Tag Along or Let Go? Parents' First-Day Dilemma
Aug. 22, 2008
Page 2 of 2
"If you can make a connection with the teacher before the first day of school, that's wonderful," Domene said. "Then you don't have a stranger educating your child."
Domene adds that parents should also meet with the principal and the school secretary -- two other figures who will likely play a large role in a student's school experience.
"This is just like building a relationship with anyone you do business with; you need to build a relationship with that school," she said.
How to Let Go
But when it comes to standing by your child, how much is too much? It turns out that for parents, gauging exactly how far their presence should extend into school walls is a delicate balancing act.
"You don't want what's called 'helicopter parents,'" Domene said. "Helicopter parents are those parents who hover over everything. It becomes a nuisance in a way; that is not a help."
Worse, Domene says, such nurturing can also backfire. "Other students will have a tendency to think, 'This is a little momma's baby.'"
For young children, parents may do well to institute a five-minute limit on the first day, staying only long enough to ensure that their child is settled in.
"It is really helpful for the child when a parent walks them into a classroom, maybe introduces them to another child, gives them a kiss and a hug and says, 'Have a great day. Tell me about it when you get home,'" said Danielle Kassow, associate of research and evaluation at Thrive by Five Washington.
Sarah Smith, senior editor of New York-based Parenting Magazine, agrees.
"The key is to not linger too long," she said. "Set up the situation ahead of time with kid. Walk in, kiss goodbye and leave.
"Lots of parents make the mistake of staying longer if their kids cry when they leave. That doesn't do anybody any good."
But Kassow adds that parents must also make sure to let their kids know when they are on the way out the door.
"It is not good to drop a child off and then sneak out," she said. "That can be really damaging. In that situation, the child says, 'Oh no, where did my parent go?' ... It creates a situation of mistrust."
But while many parents may feel as if they are walking a tightrope with their child's development, the good news is that kids can give cues of their own -- something St. Aude quickly learned.
"My older daughter was always really blunt about it; she would roll her eyes and say, 'I'm OK,'" St. Aude said. "She got to the point where she begged to ride the school bus."

More Young Women Having Strokes
March 4, 2012
By JENNIFER WOLFF PERRINEWomen's Health The number of young adults having strokes is on the rise according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Getty Images

In the middle of having sex with her boyfriend, Kara Jackson's* heavy breathing suddenly turned into labored breathing.
Her tongue felt swollen, like a balloon in her throat, blocking her airway. Stark naked, she bolted upright and tried to reassure her boyfriend that she was OK. But her mouth could not string together the sentence her brain was forming. "My words totally garbled, like I was tripping over my tongue," she recalls. "I tried again, but I still couldn't speak. That's when the panic set in."
She felt like crying but couldn't even do that. As her boyfriend called 911, Kara thought, I should put on some clothes before the medics arrive. But she couldn't move her left arm. Or stand up.
By the time the ambulance reached her New York City apartment building, Kara was able to speak again. But a throbbing headache had set in, one with a visual aura, as though a camera flashbulb had blinked and stayed on. She told the medics she thought she was having an allergic reaction, although to what she didn't know. Or, she speculated, it was "a really weird migraine"--but quite different from the ones she'd experienced since she was 13. "Truth is, I had no idea what was happening to me," Kara now says.
In fact, at 23, Kara had just suffered a stroke.
5 Steps to a Healthy Heart
This past fall, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study showing an alarming rise among young adults in the number of acute ischemic strokes, by far the most common kind, in which the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off due to a blockage. From 1995 to 2008, the number of women ages 15 to 34 who were hospitalized for this type of stroke rose some 23 percent, from 3,750 a year to nearly 4,900. For the next age-group, 35 to 44, hospitalizations jumped 29 percent, from 9,400 a year to nearly 13,400. And a second study found that strokes among 20-to 44-year-old Caucasians (who are generally at lesser risk than African Americans) has more than doubled since 1993.
"This is a significant and scary change," says Brett Kissela, M.D., a neurology professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and lead author of the latter study. Stroke is commonly, and justifiably, thought of as a curse for older people: The average stroke victim is 68 years old. What's causing its rise among the young is one of the most urgent questions facing the medical community today. "The question is, are we seeing more strokes in young people or are we better at finding them?" asks Kissela. "My belief is that we're seeing more strokes. This could prove an expensive and devastating trend for society, as well as for each person who goes from healthy one second to disabled the next."
