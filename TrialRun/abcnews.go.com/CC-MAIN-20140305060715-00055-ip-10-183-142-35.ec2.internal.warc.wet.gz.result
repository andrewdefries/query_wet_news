Poll: Bush Hits 50 Percent
Oct. 19, 2004 Analysis By DALIA SUSSMAN and GARY LANGER Support for President Bush has crept above the critical 50-percent mark for the first time in two weeks, but one group -- new voters -- could be John Kerry's wildcard.
Fifty-one percent of likely voters support Bush, 46 percent support Kerry and 1 percent prefer Ralph Nader in the latest ABC News tracking poll, based on interviews Saturday through Monday. That's a slight lead for the president after a 48 percent to 48 percent dead heat the second half of last week.
Kerry could benefit by drawing more first-time voters to the polls: He holds an 11-point advantage among self-identified first-time voters, 54 percent to 43 percent. That's about the same as Al Gore's margin among first-timers, nine points, in 2000. The question is whether enough of them show up to make the difference for Kerry.
Sampling, data collection and tabulation for this poll were done by TNS.
Ten percent of likely voters say this will be their first time voting in a presidential election, about the same as their turnout in 2000. Turnout overall is looking to be up: Sixty-two percent of likely voters are following the race very closely, up 20 points from this time in 2000, and Americans are four points more apt to say they're registered to vote.
New Voters
The vast majority of first-timers -- 82 percent -- are under age 30. And whether it's their first time at the polls or not, young voters currently are Kerry's best age group, the only one in which he win
