Smoking Worsens Multiple Sclerosis
Aug. 18
By Kathleen DohenyHealthDay Reporter MONDAY, Aug. 17 (HealthDay News) -- Patients with multiple sclerosis who smoke appear to be at higher risk for the brain lesions linked with the disease and for brain shrinkage, new research suggests.
"Our study is showing that MS is more destructive as seen on MRI in smokers than nonsmokers," said study co-author Dr. Bianca Weinstock-Guttman, director of the Baird MS Center and Pediatric MS Center of Excellence at the State University of New York at Buffalo. The study appears in the Aug. 18 issue of Neurology.
Researchers have known that smoking boosts the risk of getting MS, but the effect of smoking after diagnosis has been studied less often.
MS, a chronic disease that attacks the central nervous system, including the spinal cord, brain and optic nerve, affects about 400,000 Americans, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Symptoms can be mild, such as limb numbness, or severe, such as loss of vision or paralysis.
The different courses that MS can take include relapsing and remitting, progressive, or progressive and relapsing, the society says. Weinstock-Guttman and her colleagues evaluated 368 MS patients, average age 44, who had been diagnosed about 12 years earlier. Of the 368 patients, 240 had never smoked, 96 smoked currently and 32 had smoked in the past.
All patients were evaluated clinically and had an MRI to monitor the disease process and evaluate the effects of treatments. The MRI measured the size of the MS-related brain lesions and the brain shrinkage that can occur with age and with MS.
Smokers with MS had nearly 17 percent more brain lesions than nonsmokers with MS. Smokers with MS also had more brain tissue shrinkage.
Exactly why smoking has this effect isn't known, Weinstock-Guttman said. However, she suspects that nicotine may disrupt the blood-brain barrier, and the toxins in cigarette smoke may be a constant, inflammatory irritant. "Smokers aren't able to repair themselves" due to the constant presence of the toxins from cigarette smoke, she explained. So, the inflammation that is characteristic of the disease never goes away, setting patients up for worsening disease.
The recent study lends weight to the conclusion, reached in some but not all previous studies, that smoking does in fact worsen MS symptoms, said Dr. John Richert, executive vice president for research and clinical programs for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which helped to fund the study.
In the past few years, he said, some studies have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of smoking on MS symptoms. But with the latest finding, he said, it tips the balance and confirms that smoking does indeed seem to worsen the symptoms.
"I think the most current paper is probably right," he said. "It certainly is consistent with the data that shows that smoking increases the risk of developing MS in the first place."
MS patients should give up smoking for general health reasons anyway, Richert added. "Now we can add another reason, that it might make your MS worse, according to two of three studies."
Weinstock-Guttman said her MS patients who smoke have been receptive to the new information. "They are much more open now to considering quitting smoking," she noted.
Smoking is also linked to worsening of psoriasis. In an Italian study, people with psoriasis who smoked 20 cigarettes a day had twice the risk of more severe symptoms than those who smoked less than 10 cigarettes a day. The effects were more pronounced among women than men, the researchers found.

Michael Strahan: I'm not 'all hype'
January 29, 2014
DAN GRAZIANO via ESPN NEW YORK -- Warren Sapp doesn't think Michael Strahan belongs in the Hall of Fame. Strahan, who has achieved fame on a level few former NFL stars have since his retirement from football, says he doesn't care.
"Football was part of my life, but it is not my entire life," said the former New York Giants defensive end, who's one of 15 finalists for Saturday's Pro Football Hall of Fame election. "So for some guys, maybe that's their entire life and that's all they have to hold on to. Playing football, sacking quarterbacks, that was part of my life, and I did it and I moved on. The tiger does not pay attention to the opinion of the sheep."

Sapp, the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers pass-rusher, was elected to the Hall of Fame last year. But he has been openly critical of Strahan's candidacy for reasons that Strahan says elude him. Sapp spoke at Super Bowl media day in Newark on Tuesday and reiterated his case against Strahan's election.
"I don't think his résumé stacks up," Sapp said, listing Tony Dungy, Walter Jones, Marvin Harrison and Derrick Brooks as more deserving candidates on this year's ballot. "Four straight Pro Bowls and a mythical sack record. When you really measure it up, he comes up short, except you all are giving it to him."
Sapp has been critical of Strahan's single-season sack record of 22.5 since Strahan set it in 2001 on a play on which Packers quarterback Brett Favre appeared to take a dive. Strahan hasn't always fired back, but he offered plenty of response Tuesday to Sapp's assertion that his Hall of Fame candidacy is propped up by the media.
"I am. I'm all hype," Strahan said. "I lasted 15 years, all hype. I had 141.5 career sacks, all hype. I was always a starter. I played left end, and that made me get sacks. My coaches kept putting me in the game because they felt it gave us the best chance to win, and that was all hype."
Strahan has continually insisted that he's not giving much thought to Saturday's election and that he wasn't crushed last year when he failed to make it into the Hall of Fame on the first ballot. He points out that he's extremely busy co-hosting his ABC morning talk show, "Live with Kelly and Michael," and Fox Sports' Sunday NFL pregame show. But he did allow that, with the Super Bowl being played in New Jersey and co-hosted by New York this year, an election this time around would be extra-special.
"If you make it in anywhere, it doesn't matter," Strahan said. "To be honest with you, I get reminded of it by everybody else. I don't think about it. If I make it in, that would be awesome. If I make it in in New York, that would be double-incredible."
As for his opinion of Sapp, the first thing Strahan said when asked about his comments Tuesday likely speaks the loudest.
"I'm glad he doesn't have a vote," Strahan said. -- This embed didnt make it to copy for story id = 22272675.
