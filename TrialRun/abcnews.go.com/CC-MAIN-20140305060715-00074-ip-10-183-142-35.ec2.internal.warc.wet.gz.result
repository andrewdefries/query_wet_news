California's 7th Congressional District Race 2014: ABC News' '14 For '14'
February 2, 2014

ABC News' "14 For 14" project is documenting 14 races that matter between now and November. This page will be updated throughout the year. See the full list of 2014 midterm election contests the ABC News political team is tracking.
THE PLAYERS
Rep. Ami Bera
Democrat
Freshman member of Congress.
Age: 48 (born: March 2, 1965)
Doug Ose Republican
Former member of Congress from California's 3rd Congressional District (1999-2005).
Age: 58 (born: born June 27, 1955)
Igor Birman
Republican
Former chief of Staff to Rep. Tom McClintock.
Elizabeth Emken
Republican
Unsuccessful 2012 U.S. Senate nominee.
Age: 50 (born: April 4, 1963)
THE STAKES
Democrats badly want to keep this seat, and Republicans badly want to win it back. The result is likely to be one of the most brawling battles of political tug-of-war in the country. This northern California district was so evenly divided during the 2012 election cycle that the eventual winner, Ami Bera, showed up for House freshman orientation in Washington, DC while a recount was still ongoing back home. Bera, a medical doctor, is seeking a second term during a year when the clumsy rollout of Obamacare is topping the list of Republican talking points. California may be a solid blue state, but make no mistake, this is the swingiest of the state's swing districts with a nearly even split between registered Democrats and Republicans.
THE OUTLOOK
This true toss-up race in a district just east of Sacramento stretching into the foothills of Lake Tahoe will undoubtedly be one of the most competitive and expensive House contests. Three Republicans are vying for the opportunity to take on Bera, the Democratic incumbent: Doug Ose, a former congressman; Igor Birman, a Tea Party-allied former Congressional chief of staff; and Elizabeth Emken, an advocate for autism causes who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Dianne Feinstein in 2012. Of the three, Ose appears to have the best chance of clearing the primary hurdle. If he does, it will be a summer and fall of hand-to-hand combat with Bera, who began the year with a significant fundraising advantage over all of his potential GOP rivals.

BOB WOODRUFF REPORTS ON THE ABC NEWS SPECIAL, “EARTH 2100,” AIRING TUESDAY, JUNE 2
It is an idea that most of us would rather not face — that within the next century, life as we know it could come to an end. Our civilization could crumble, leaving only traces of modern human existence behind. It seems outlandish, extreme, and even impossible. But according to cutting edge scientific research, it is a real possibility — unless we make drastic changes now. “If we continue on the business as usual trajectory, there will be a tipping point that we cannot avert,” says John Holdren, science advisor to President Obama. “We will indeed drive the car over the cliff.” Experts say over the next hundred years the “perfect storm” of population growth, resource depletion and climate change could converge with catastrophic results. ABC News’ “Earth 2100,” hosted by Bob Woodruff, takes viewers on a virtual journey through the next century to find out what may lie ahead and what might be done to avoid disaster. The two-hour special airs on Tuesday, June 2 (9:00-11:00 p.m.) on the ABC Television Network.
Based on the predictions of world-renowned scientists, the special shows a world that could be horrific: a devastating famine leading to massacre in San Diego; unprecedented drought in Las Vegas – as well as inspiring: the citizens of Greensburg, Kansas harness the force of wind and rain in order to rebuild their city; New York City runs its buildings with solar power and its vehicles on emissions-free electricity. But it is not too late to change course if we start taking steps now, New York Times Foreign Affairs Columnist Thomas Friedman tells Woodruff. “We will be able to create a world that will be a livable planet for our kids and their kids. That is our opportunity. That is our obligation,” he says.

ABC’s Sunlen Miller reports: The Obama campaign will begin airing a third TV ad today in New Hampshire, as the Senator launches a three day swing thought the state.
The thirty-second ad appropriately called "Conventional" highlights a message that Obama preaches on the campaign trail, that he is the candidate who will defy conventional Washington thinking. Saying America should be the "beacon of light around the world again" the ad states "When we break out of the conventional thinking and we start reaching out to friend and foe alike, then I am absolutely confident that we can restore America’s leadership in the world."
The ad ends with Obama saying, "I want to go before the world and say America is back." As the ad launches, Senator Obama will be making his eighteenth visit to the granite state Email
