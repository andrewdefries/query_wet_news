Almost ready to go back to the life I left behind. But I first wanted to take another step at trying to place the meaning of this experience of my life. I needed to huddle with my dear friend, diane, in the flesh. No, really. Some things never change. How much of your life has been spent watching me trying to get my buttons buttoned and the right thing here? Thelma and louise ride again. So when you wake up in the morning, what's different now? I would wake up and almost kind of, like, barely open one eye and go, "how am I going to feel today? Oh, I still feel yucky." So now, to wake up and to feel as close to normal as I have in such a long time. What is that close to normal? I feel pretty much like myself. I mean, but I'm in no pain whatsoever. I have always been an optimist, and I will say this to people who, when they're facing a tough challenge, being optimistic is like a muscle that gets stronger Do you think you can learn it, you can learn optimism? I think -- I think in time -- I think you can be aware of it. I've been -- I've been an optimistic person all my life, and I know that it drives some people crazy. You know, especially, you know, like morning. Morning people, like, "how can you?" I'd come in in the morning, and I still do now, and I'm like, "i love coming in." And I love the morning, and i love all that, and there are some people who are a little grumpier in the morning. I mean, apart from "don't talk to me," I don't know why you think I'm grumpy. No, no. But I think it can be. I think it's just easier if you -- if you've done it your life, or the majority of your life. I think it just makes it easier for when those tough times come along. The one time I thought you weren't trying to -- you weren't trying to make it okay for me was when you told me the story of the nurse and saying your name. I remember one particular evening not feeling well at all and just slipping away. And I was in a coma like state. And as clear as all get out, i hear my name, robin! Robin! And I remember, is that my name? I was somewhere different, and i just remember opening my eyes. And my sweet nurse, jenny -- because they always had a mask on, so I could only see their eyes. Her eyes were, like, this large. And she's just kind of looking at me. And how am I going to get through this? How am I going to be better? But -- did you think in that moment you had a choice, if she hadn't been there? I was thinking about my mom a lot. And in fact, truth be known, at first I thought it was my mom calling my name. I thought it was my mom. I thought it was my mom's voice. And then I realized, when i opened my eyes, that it was jenny, my nurse. And in a way, I think it was my mom's voice and not for me to come where she is now but to stay where I am. And I don't know, had jenny not been there, I was in that kind of just -- but boy, you know what? She was. It was shortly thereafter that i turned the corner. I definitely turned a corner then. And this week, I kept going. I share this morning, this day of celebration with everyone. She's the heart of soul of this place. And we know, she is just getting started. That is cute. Good morning, america. She makes me a happier person. These are the people you want in your life. And robin is that to me. She is a role model and how you deal with the struggles of lime. Do you think of it in terms of being free now? Is that now a useful way to think? What I'm facing nows different. My doctors have been cautious to use the word remission. I've been cautious to say that word, too. At this very moment, this day that I'm talking to you, diane, I do not have mds. I do not have preleukemia on this day. And that's all that I can control right now. My heart still beats very fast when I go see the doctor on a regular basis and the blood work is drawn and I wait for the results. Everyone says that dissipates over time. You don't have to go as frequently as more time passes. But it's nothing that's going to stay with me long-term. I can't -- then it's won and, you know, I'm competitive. I don't like to lose. I don't like to lose, and i don't want it to win. And if the fear overtakes me, then it wins. Then why did I go through all that? Did I go through all these last six months, all this pain, all this anguish, all this everything to sit here now and be in fear? Snowwhere is it written that we should not be happy. That you get extra bonus points at the end because I trudged along and did what you thought you should do. I want to be happy. Now, are there days? This is a good day. And there are some days you kind of havwhere it creeps in. Do you have something that you do when it does? What is it? Fear and doubt. All it needs is the eye of a needle to get through and it takes over. What do I do? I breath. Pat summit told me this. Left foot, right foot, breathe. Left foot, right foot, breathe. What do you see when you look in your eyes, your own eyes now in the morning? You know what? I see a strong woman. I know people have said that about me. But we all know our own insecurities, and we all know how we really feel about ourselves. I feel strength like I've never felt before. I do. I know how fortunate I was to receive such excellent health care. And it's a blessing I wish everyone could have when they need it. And if I learned one lesson yntd all others, it's with faith, family and friends, you are strong. Even stronger than you think. That was great. Let me sit down. Oh! It just makes you feel better. There is no place like home! This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Excerpt From 'Sound of Hope' by Lois Heymann and Rosie O'Donnell
April 27, 2010
Page 4 of 6
Most people recognize that birth defects, infections, blockages, eardrum punctures, tinnitus from loud noises, and various other things can adversely affect the middle and inner ear, important parts of the hearing equation. But a lot can also go wrong during a sound's journey along the eighth cranial nerve through the relay stations and inside the auditory cortex. APD is a condition that affects that interior trip to the auditory cortex and the processing stage that transforms hearing into listening within the cortex itself.
THE DEVELOPMENTAL LADDER
Since we don't yet know what causes APD and can't predict at what age it may develop, it's important to understand the typical developmental milestones common to most young children. These developmental milestones are a loose guide. They can help you to zero in on your child's listening development. If your child's listening and speaking skills don't come anywhere near the trajectory I describe, APD may be the problem. Keep in mind that the ideas, observations, and indications that follow are not one-size-fits-all. A child's journey to developmental maturity is a ladder of many rungs. Your son or daughter can pause on one rung longer than another child the same age, skip one, or even go back a few and still be well within the range of "normal." Always keep in mind that variation and individual timing is the natural order of things when it comes to growing children.
Birth to Three Months
• Newborns listen to sounds that are close to them.
• Unexpected or loud sounds may startle them or make them cry.
• New and interesting sounds may calm them or cause them to stop movement and "listen" or attend. Recognizing attention in a newborn can be tricky at first. Sometimes it's visible only in an interruption of sucking on a pacifier or a bottle.
• The baby begins to localize and turn in the direction of a sound source.
• A familiar voice gets greeted with a familiar expression, sound, or gesture.
• The baby responds to soft, comforting tones.
In the first ninety days of life, a newborn infant is fully occupied by the basic needs for comfort, food, rest, hygiene, and love. During these first beautiful months your baby spends most of his or her day sleeping and being kept clean, fed, and adored. At the same time that your baby begins to develop a sense of touch she also begins to respond to the trust and warmth she soaks up from the people who care for her. By the third month your baby begins to grasp and hold things such as rattles and stuffed animals, and fully expects that her comfort and contact needs will be met.
Initially your baby communicates by crying. You and the other adults around her begin to read her signals and recognize that the specific cry for being hungry is different from the cry for being wet. Soon she will start making other sounds and playing with her growing ability to vocalize; she will repeat sounds that get your attention and approval.

See More Well now to the big headline for everyone traveling and going through security at the airport for the first time since 9/11, the tsa is allowing some knives aboard planes. The announcement has been greeted with outrage by flight attendants. Abc's david kerley has the story. Reporter: An abrupt reversal this morning after a decade of banning and confiscating pocket knives, the government will now allow small knives on planes drawing an immediate angry response from flight attendants. It's going to create passenger confusion and it's also going to bring a weapon on board. It doesn't make any sense to allow knives on board aircraft. Reporter: This is what will be allowed in a month and a half, small folding knives with a blade shorter than 2.36 inches and 1/2 inch wide. Rules relaxed to carry on golf clubs, pool cues, lacrosse and hockey sticks. The tsa says it's about risk assessment. Every month at the 20 largest airports, four tons of knives are confiscated. We need to keep the screening lines moving at this point and looking for tiny little objects that are not likely to be used to hack an airplane is really just going to slow things down. Reporter: The head of the tsa told airline officials he wants to concentrate on what really worries him, explosives, especially the liquid explosives which are difficult to detect. Flight attendants complain there is an irony in this change by tsa. While the small pocket knifes are allowed, box cutters like the ones used to hijack the planes on 9/11 are still banned. They cannot be carried on to a plane. George? Thank goodness for that. Thanks very much. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Gov. David Paterson was sworn in to become first African-American governor of New York. Thrust into power after Eliot Spitzer's prostitution scandal forced him to resign, Paterson, whose term has also been laced with personal scandal, continues to struggle to win over the Democratic Party and the citizens of New York.

Bush. As the first black American in this position, Rice's role in shaping foreign policy became increasingly important, most notably after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Four years later, upon the resignation of Colin Powell, Rice became secretary of state. She was the first African-American woman, second African-American -- after Powell -- and second woman after Madeleine Albright, to serve in the critical post.

"I cannot escape the fact that I come to the Senate as a symbol of hope and change," Moseley-Braun said shortly after she was sworn in in 1993. Pictured here, Braun declares her victory Nov. 3, 1992, in Chicago. She was not re-elected in 1998. While Braun was the first black woman elected to the Senate, in 1966 Republican Edward Brooke of Massachusetts became the first African-American to be elected to the Senate by popular vote.

Formerly an NAACP attorney, Marshall became the first black justice to sit on the Supreme Court. While Marshall had an extensive legacy on the high court, perhaps his most significant victory came before he was a judge, successfully arguing to end the legal separation of black and white children in the public school system in the landmark case Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954. This ruling later sparked the 1960s civil rights movement and had a profound effect on race relations in America.Henry Griffin/AP PhotoBlack History MonthCivil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. waves to supporters from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial Aug. 28, 1963, on the Mall in Washington, during the March on Washington.

President Obama’s pipeline lobbying paid off…for now.
A controversial Republican amendment to a transportation bill, to mandate construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, has failed in the Senate.
The numbers may be a little too close for comfort for the White House: the amendment fell just short of the 60 votes needed for the amendment to be included in the final bill at 56-42.
President Obama had personally lobbied Democrats, telephoning members of Congress directly to encourage them to reject the measure.
The amendment would have taken the pipeline’s approval process out of President Obama’s hands and mandated an expedited building of the pipeline project in light of the nation’s rising gas prices.
“The president obviously has communications with members of Congress with some regularity,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said on Thursday confirming the lobbying effort. “We have made our position clear about purely ideological and political efforts to attach legislation regarding the Keystone pipeline to whatever some members of Congress fancy at the time.”
This pressure from the president put many moderate Democrats, some of whom are running for re-election from oil producing states that would benefit from the pipeline, in tough positions with their vote today.
Ultimately, eleven Democrats voted in favor of the pipeline provision, bucking the White House’s stance on the issue – Sen. Max Baucus, D-MT., Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., Sen. Kent Conrad, D-ND., Sen. Kay Hagan, D-NC., Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Lou, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-WV., Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virg.
Not a single Republican voted against the measure. Sen. Kirk, R-Ill., and Sen. Thune, R-SD., missed the vote.
This close vote will provide motivation for Republicans to keep pushing for the pipeline.
Moments after the vote Republicans vowed to keep fighting on this issue and said they were “heartened” by the 56 votes indicating that with work this could eventually get passed.
“We’re going to continue this fight,” Sen. John Hoeven, R-ND., one of the sponsors of the bill said adding that he was hopeful there might be other opportunities, perhaps in the conference committee to add this amendment once again. “The pressure is just going to increase on the administration to get this project done.”
Republicans blamed President Obama for the failure of the measure.
“It was very strong words by President Obama himself making calls to the Democrats,” Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., said, ” I suppose you can give credit to the president for once again blocking something.”
“President Obama’s personal pleas to wavering Senators may have tipped the balance against this legislation,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kent., said in a statement, “When it comes to delays over Keystone, anyone looking for a culprit should now look no further than the Oval Office.”
The amendment would have been part of the $109 billion transportation bill that Senators have been debating on for weeks. After a deal was reached last night and the vote on amendments was held today it looks like the bill will be on track for final passage next week before the March 31st deadline for passage.	Email
