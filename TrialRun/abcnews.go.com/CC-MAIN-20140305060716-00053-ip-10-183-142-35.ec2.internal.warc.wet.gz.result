From Sweat to Blushing: Top 6 Body Betrayals
June 3, 2009
Page 2 of 4
Excessive Sweating: Hyperhidrosis Sweating isn't exactly a bodily function one can control but the vast majority of people have the luxury of sweating when everyone else in the same hot car, same basketball team, or classroom is just as hot as they are.
That's not so for the 2 to 3 percent of people with the unpredictable, uncontrollable sweating of hyperhidrosis.
"Ever since I was in elementary school, I'd say probably second grade, I remember being in class and my hands just sweating as I worked, having my hand on a paper, and the paper being saturated from my hands sweating so much," Wendy Burke told ABC News' "Good Morning America" in 2004. "So, I mean it's really been something I've lived with almost all my life."
Burke said at first adults didn't believe her and doctors did not take her seriously. They said, 'Oh, you're just clammy.' Everybody blew me off."
Dr. David Pariser, current secretary of the International Hyperhidrosis Society, told "Good Morning America" that many hyperhidrosis patients suffer socially and practically from the condition.
"I constantly hear about patients who are having to change their shirt three to four times a day, who stuff diapers in the sleeves of their shirt under their arms to absorb the moisture, who only buy black clothes and wear multiple layers, who never wear tank tops in the summer because they're afraid of the embarrassment of the sweating," he said.
Pariser said the cause of hyperhidrosis is unknown, but doctors have found some effective treatments including sending electrical pulses through sweat glands and injecting Botulinum Toxin Type A, commonly known as Botox, to paralyze sweat glands.
Spasmodic Dysphonia: An Uncontrolled Voice
For a rare disease that cripples the vocal chords ability to make the most common sound, spasmodic dysphonia has some notable speakers and politicians as sufferers.
"It's a very rare disorder, and there is really very little known about it -- especially back in the '80s and '90s," said Dr. Phillip Song, a laryngologist at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston.
People with spasmodic dysphonia in the media, such as National Public Radio talk show host Diane Rehm, have helped bring spasmodic dysphonia to national attention.
But few people knew what was wrong when Lorraine Rappaport started noticing her voice changing back in the early 1980s while working as a school counselor in California.
"It came on gradually; it isn't like anything that happens overnight," said Rappaport. "My voice got very hoarse, and there were certain letters of the alphabet at the beginning of words that I could not say easily."
Slowly, her condition started to interfere with her job and her communication with others.
"There were times where I had to stop and think, because I wanted to avoid a word because I couldn't say it clearly." Rappaport started avoiding words that began with "h," "ch," "k" or "c" -- a difficult task in English. She had never heard of spasmodic dysphonia at the time, and physicians kept telling her the problem was psychological, especially since she was getting a divorce at the time.
But by the early 1990s, Rappaport found treatment for her condition in a National Institutes of Health clinical trial using Botox injections. The NIH flew her to Maryland from California to receive the low-dose injections, and she started to see an improvement.

Supreme Court Justice Souter to Retire
May 1, 2009
Page 3 of 3
Stephanopoulos said the selection process for a Supreme Court nominee will likely be headed by White House counsel Greg Craig, but that Vice President Joe Biden, who served on the Senate Judiciary Committee during six Supreme Court confirmations, could also play a big role.
President George H.W. Bush appointed Souter to the court in 1990. Souter came out of nowhere, a blank slate, unknown outside his home state of New Hampshire.
Bush had been assured that the quiet New Englander would be a solid conservative.
"If it were possible for me to express to you the realization that I have of the honor which the president has just done me, I would try, and I would keep you here as long tonight as I had to do to get it out," Souter said of his nomination.
But Souter was a surprise, and to conservatives, a mistake. He became one of the court's most reliable liberals.
"Justice Souter was somebody who came into every case with an open mind," said Feder, his former clerk.
Feder recalled several of Souter's most memorable opinions that defined his place on the court.
Souter's Legacy: Memorable Decisions
"What will be most remembered," Feder told ABC News, is his role in the 1992 decision that reaffirmed Roe v. Wade.
"At the time, most people expected that the recent appointments to the court would result in Roe being gutted or overruled. He wrote the part of the opinion stressing how important it was for court to respect prior decisions and not let major constitutional principles swing back and forth with every new appointment," Feder said. "Aside from the obvious importance of the opinion, it captures a fundamental part of his approach to judging."
Noting that Souter is a "deeply religious person himself," Feder said he "regularly voted to keep government out of religious matters" such as school prayer or the creation of a special school district for a religious sect.
"And Bush v. Gore has to be mentioned," Feder added. "He dissented from the decision to stop the Florida recount, and it's widely understood that he was deeply disillusioned by what the court did there."
An eccentric bachelor with a spartan lifestyle, Souter disliked Washington and for years has told friends he longed to go home. And now it appears he will get his wish.
