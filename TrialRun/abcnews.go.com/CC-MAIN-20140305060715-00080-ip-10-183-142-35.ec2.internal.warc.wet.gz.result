Death of an AIDS Skeptic
Jan. 1, 2009
By LAUREN COXABC News Medical Unit Christine Maggiore, an AIDS activist-turned-HIV/AIDS-skeptic, died in her home Saturday of pneumonia, according to the Associated Press.
The Los Angeles coroner's office has yet to determine if her pneumonia was AIDS-related. If it was, it could serve as an ironic end to her work, promoting the idea that there is no definite link between HIV and AIDS, and that HIV tests are inaccurate.
Whatever details her autopsy reveals, Maggiore's life may prove to be more controversial than her death.
Since 1992, Maggiore founded two HIV/AIDS skeptic groups, including the Alive and Well AIDS Alternatives group in Los Angeles. Later, she traveled to Africa and is said to have personally influenced former South African President Thabo Mbeki's decision to block funding for HIV-positive pregnant women in South Africa.
Maggiore also appeared on TV, in Mothering magazine and in documentaries describing her decision to marry, have unprotected sex, and later breast-feed her two children without taking the drug AZT, which is typically prescribed to prevent an HIV transmission from mother to baby.
AIDS researchers and public health advocates have overwhelmingly condemned her work and personal life as deadly.
"They caused the death of thousands of South Africans by delaying treatment and spreading infections," said Dr. Charlie van der Horst, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
Van der Horst referred to a journal study that estimated 330,000 lives were lost to new AIDS infections during the time Mbeki blocked government funding of AZT treatment to mothers.
"There is a space in hell reserved for them," said van der Horst.
Other scientists have a more visceral reaction to Maggiore's cause.
"The image, on the cover of a magazine aimed at mothers, of her heavily pregnant, naked belly, daubed with a slogan 'No AZT' in red paint was one of the single sickest images the AIDS pandemic has ever seen," said John P. Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York City.
At the time of the picture, Maggiore was pregnant with daughter Eliza Jane Scovill. In 2005, Eliza Jane died at age 3 of pneumonia. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office determined her death to be AIDS-related, but the Scovill family claimed Eliza Jane died from a reaction to antibiotics.
Maggiore and her husband, Robin Scovill were investigated, but never faced any charges related to the death.
A Friend Lost
Michael Ellner, a long-time friend and associate of Maggiore's, believes the stress from her loss and the public backlash to her views caused her untimely death.
"I lost somebody that I admired and loved, and I expect in the next couple of weeks that she'll be raked over the coals, even though she's dead," said Ellner, who teaches hypnosis techniques to medical professionals and is the founder

They're Here To Raise Taxes
July 27, 2010
Page 2 of 3
It is one thing to hear Gregg talk about tax hikes. He's in his final term in the Senate and, perhaps, a bit less encumbered than a Republican who must face the voters in years to come.
Rep. Michele Bachmann on Extending Unemployment Benefits
It is another thing entirely to hear the top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell -- who is accountable to all his members and will help set the Republican agenda in years to come -- say the same thing.
"I think that we have a serious problem here because we spend too much. I think we ought to concentrate on the spending side," said McConnell. But then he referenced Bowle's ratio.
"I've in fact been encouraged by the comments of Erskine Bowles, who's one of the chairmen of the president's Deficit Reduction Commission, a Democrat, who's saying that he thinks two-thirds or three-fourths of the problem is a spending problem. So that's where we ought to -- That's where we ought to start."
McConnell spokesman Don Stewart later clarified that McConnell was not endorsing Bowles' ratio, but pointing out that the commission chairman, a Democrat, thinks the onus should be on cuts rather than tax hikes.
Most Republicans on Capitol Hill have taken a hard pledge not to ever raise taxes. Sponsored by Americans for Tax Reform, the pledge counts the vast majority of Republican lawmakers -- 33 Senators (including a Democrat, Ben Nelson) and 173 House members (including four Democrats).
Leaders from both parties have promised that if 14 of the 18 debt commission members can agree on a debt reduction proposal, Congressional leaders have promised to seek an up or down vote on it in December.
Any tax hikes will have vocal opposition.
"If the deficit reduction commission comes up with a combo approach, tax hikes and spending cuts, how would I reel about that? Not good." Said Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican widely thought to be eyeing a run for the Presidency in 2012. "I don't think the argument could credibly made that the United States of America is undertaxed compared to our competitors," he said at a meeting with reporters Monday in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor.
Pawlenty suggested that modernizing Medicare to make it focus more on results than providing services would cut down on costs. If Democrats experience in enacting health care reform is any guide, though, Medicare reform would not be easy. He also suggested giving younger workers the option of taking control of their own social security contributions.
Transitioning Social Security from a plan with defined, monthly checks to seniors into a 401k-style plan has many fans on the right, but is often demonized on the left as privatization. A plan to transition social security was pursued by President George W. Bush in 2005 to no avail.
A far more radical plan has been proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. He would be able to reduce the debt, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, but it would remake America in the process. He would replace Medicare with a voucher system and transition Social Security to a defined contribution system. It would also eliminate most corporate taxes and do away with tax exemptions for employer-sponsored health insurance and it would instead institute an 8.5 percent consumption tax.

Tonight, passengers asking, what's going on? Is this just bad luck or is something amiss in the cruise industry? Again tonight, abc's gio benitez. Reporter: It's been a bad week for carnival. 2,000 passengers limping back to tampa because of a technical problem. This as passengers from the dream stranded in st. Martin yesterday with a generator problem arrived home. Saturday, it was the elation, escorted by a tug boat after a steering problem. These latest incidents pale in comparison to the horror passengers went through for eight days on the carnival triumph last month. Overflowing toilets, garbage, passengers sleeping on deck. So, are these incidents discouraging potential cruisers? Well, the dream's next cruise has already been canceled. The townsends were supposed to go on it for their hon gnu momo honeymoon -- I don't think we'd do it any time toon. The cruise city is grow egg at a slower percentage than it was just a few years ago. That may be because first-time cruisers are getting scared off. Reporter: And why is carnival having so many problems? Well, it might be the sheer size of the ships. Just look at the pacific princess, the love boat, built in 1971. It's over 500 feet long. Now look at the carnival dream. Double the size. Taking a ship like that offline costs big money. Others say the problem is in carnival's low-cost model. To minimize the service, you maximize the revenue and you try to keep them moving as fast as possible back out to sea. Reporter: In a statement, carnival says it takes these this week, announced a review of its entire fleet. That was tuesday. There have been two incidents since then.

Wintry Blast Hits West, 8 Killed; Storms Head East - ABC News
X	Wintry Blast Hits West, 8 Killed; Storms Head East
By SUSAN MONTOYA BRYAN Associated Press
Nov 23, 2013, 5:08 PM
Stormy weather across the West blamed in eight deaths moved steadily eastward, prompting alerts of wintry conditions in New Mexico and Texas.
Forecasters said the storm system in the West would sweep across the South and toward the Atlantic coast the coming week, causing problems for holiday travelers.
The "Nordic outbreak" will "produce a mixed bag of wily weather that will end up impacting much of the nation," National Weather Service meteorologist Joe Harris said.
With a winter storm warning in effect for parts of New Mexico, snow was falling across much of the state early Sunday and forecasters predicted up to 5 inches for many areas.
The state Department of Transportation said motorists on several major roadways, including parts of Interstate 40, faced difficult driving conditions because of packed snow and ice, while some roads in the south were closed. Low temps were predicted to be mainly in the 20s statewide.
Station KOB reported strong winds and near white-out conditions late Saturday night along a stretch of I-40, about 80 miles west of Albuquerque.
Parts of the state had already been hit with snow and freezing rain that caused a rollover accident that killed a 4-year-old girl in the eastern part of the state.
Three other storm-related deaths were reported Saturday in a crash in the Texas Panhandle involving nearly a dozen vehicles.
In California, where the storm system hit first, prompting flooding and water rescues in recent days, three deaths have been linked to the storms since Thursday, as authorities found one body near downed power lines, one man crashed his vehicle into a tree and a woman was killed when a tree fell on a parked car.
In Arizona, firefighters recovered the body of a man who was swept away by high waters Friday in the Santa Cruz River in the southern part of the state.
The storm already has affected much of the West, causing hundreds of rollover accidents and prompting officials to cancel events and close roads.
In Nevada, snow in high elevations temporarily bogged down travel.
In Arizona, more than 8,000 cyclists competed Saturday in rainy conditions in the annual El Tour de Tucson. One cyclist died in a collision with a vehicle, but there was no immediate indication that the accident was storm related. Also, high school football games, soccer tournaments and parades were cancelled across the state.
Forecasters said parts of both California and Arizona could expect severe weather with winter storm warnings through Saturday.
In Texas, freezing rain and cold temperatures have already hampered travel and much of the "heavy stuff" will hit south of I-20, Harris said. Several traffic accidents were reported, including the fatal crash late Friday that left several injured hurt in Vega, about 30 miles west Amarillo, and one that injured three members of singer Willie Nelson's band when their bus struck a pillar on Interstate 30 near Sulphur Springs, about 75 miles northeast of Dallas.
The National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory for much of the Texas Panhandle until Monday morning, while the Dallas-Fort Worth area was under a winter storm warning until Monday.
