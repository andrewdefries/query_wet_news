Kibum Park/Raad, LLCLowline Park ProjectJames Ramsey and Dan Barasch, co-founders of the Lowline.org, say the subterranean space could also be a place for cultural events, such as theater and music. Kibum Park/Raad, LLCLowline Park ProjectThe cavernous space, which covers approximately two acres, would be transformed into a bright and grassy space in an otherwise dark and dank atmosphere.Kibum Park/Raad, LLCLowline Park ProjectLighting the space would be a challenge; a series of high-tech solar harvesters would cast light down on the space through fiber optic cables allow for plants to grow.Kibum Park/Raad, LLCLowline Park ProjectThis past September, Ramsey and Barasch staged and ambitious exhibit in a warehouse on the Lower East Side to show the world what the park might look and feel like.

The duo partnered with Sun Central, a Canadian-based solar technology firm, and Arup a design and engineering firm. Peter ParisLowline Park ProjectAs part of the exhibit, Ramsey and Barasch's team hand-fit together 600 pieces of anondized aluminum.
