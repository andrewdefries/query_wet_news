See More Freak accident. Thank you, linsey. George zimmerman's wife, shellie, is filing for dwos. She sat down with steve osunsami in sanford, florida, this morning. Good morning, steve. Reporter: Good morning, robin. She told us you can blame it on the fame. After her husband won his case at this courthouse behind me, he started acting brand-new. I have been married to a person for almost seven years. And I don't think I ever really knew him at all. Reporter:26-year-old shellie zimmerman says she's filing for divorce from her husband, who was found not guilty in the shooting death of trayvon martin because according to her court filings, their marriage is irretrievably broken. Do you feel he feels after the trial a little more invensible? In my opinion, I think he feels invincible. I think he's making reckless decisions. Reporter: Since his acquittal in july, he spent maybe three or four nights at the home they quietly shared. AND SHE MOVED OUT AUGUST 13th. She claims he has a temper. Said he was verbally abusive. And said they went to counseling but it wasn't working. I have a selfish husband. And I think george is all about george. Reporter: She has had legal troubles of her own. Just last week, she pleaded guilty to lying in june of last year at a bond hearing for her husband, about how much money they had. I stood by my husband through everything. And I kind of feel like he left me with a bunch of pieces of broken glass that I'm supposed to now assemble and make a life. Reporter: She's asking for their two dogs and a share of whatever her husband might win in a defamation lawsuit he's filed against nbc. She's also hoping she can believe behind the drama that has taken over her life since that fateful night in sanford. It's just time. I have supported him for so long. And neglected myself for too long. And I feel like I'm finally starting to feel empowered again. Reporter: We reached out to zimmerman and his attorneys. And his attorneys told under the circumstances they would not comment on his wife's allegations. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Thanksgiving's Original Hosts
Nov. 24, 2005
By CAITLIN JOHNSON The descendants of American Indians who had the first Thanksgiving with the Pilgrims have not disappeared, nor have they forgotten that fateful meal. In fact, many live in the Cape Cod town of Mashpee -- known by most for its beaches and quaint New England charm.
For the Mashpee Wampanoags, however, it's a cultural stronghold. The town was named for their tribe and its name means "land of many waters."
Even though the tribe is deeply rooted in the town, the tribe has yet to be recognized by the federal government. In fact, the Mashpee Wampanoags have spent the last 30 years trying to prove that they are in fact a real tribe after the federal government refused to accept their application in the 1970s.
"We've been kind of at odds with the United States government off and on for things they have not done or tried to do to us," tribal council chairman Glen Marshall said. "It's about taking your historical place with the other historical tribes."
It's also about getting the same health care and low income housing the federal government provides to
