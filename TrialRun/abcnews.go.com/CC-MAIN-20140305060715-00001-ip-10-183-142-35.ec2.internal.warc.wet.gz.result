Is the Twinkie Back for Good?

Twinkies snack cakes sit in a tray in the packaging area of a Hostess bakery in Schiller Park, Ill., July 15, 2013. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images
When I'm commuting, on the road or otherwise out and about, I always have an eye out for stuff to bring home to share with my wife. There is no pattern, I'm all over the map, the objective being put a smile on her face and reinforce the fact I've been thinking about her while I was away. Might be an indie flick from a RedBox kiosk, a tchotchke from a hotel gift shop or even a good joke.
Last week however, I really hit the jackpot: big smile, hug and a kiss.
What did I do? I brought home a package of newly minted, recently revived Twinkies.
Yep, Twinkies is back, with new marketing and a brand new target. As usual, I began to pay closer attention to what they are doing and started evaluating their efforts. The question is: will this re-launch actually save and grow the brand long-term or have they just capitalized on nostalgia for a short-lived revival?
Read More: Shelves Stocked for Twinkies' 'Sweetest Comeback'
First of all, for those of you who were not paying attention, Hostess, the company that made Twinkies, filed for bankruptcy and ultimately shut down. Stores all over the country, for the first time in more than 70 years, found themselves without the Quonset hut shaped snacks. For more than eight months, fans of the junk food superfood had to do without, or make do with the handful of imitators who nailed the shape and color but couldn't quite match the texture or taste.
But now, the crème-filled twin cakes are back and they have a plan to target men 18 to 35 who like to snack. (There is a secondary target of moms, but that will ramp up once they have some planned product extensions on the shelves.)
The re-launch to date has focused heavily on men in the new target, while the messaging has also been inclusive of past fans for the product who missed it while it was off the shelf.
The company was purchased by C. Dean Metropoulos & Co and Apollo Group Management, both private equity firms. Metropoulos has also recently purchased Bumble Bee Tuna, Chef Boyardee and Pabst Blue Ribbon.
The snack cake is now smaller (this happened just before the bankruptcy) and has a longer shelf life (45 days, not infinity, a myth perpetuated by urban legend.)

The launch tagline, "The Sweetest Comeback in the History of Ever," is being used in a traditional ad campaign. There are some high-visibility location outdoor ads in New York (including Times Square), Chicago and Los Angeles.
Grassroots promotion includes buttons that say "I Saved Twinkies" and a Twinkies food truck on a road trip across the country passing out samples. There has been heavy social media activity on Facebook, Twitter and its Vine video service and Instagram.
The company also has long-term plans to extend the Twinkies line to include gluten free, bite-sized, low sugar and fiber-enriched versions.
The re-launch has been successful, according to the company: Almost 85 million Twinkies have been shipped, and re-order demand has been steady. With no new product news, the brand has been riding the excitement of returning an iconic brand to the people.
Once that wears off, experts agree, the brand will need to focus on adding new devotees; a harder proposition given healthier lifestyle trends. The question that needs to be answered is what the company will do to grow the brand. Twinkies sales had been declining before the sale, according to court papers, so nostalgia will only be able to take the brand so far.
Twinkies has a very strong brand. Perhaps the new owners will be able to expand the footprint and launch new products or find complementary associations that can increase the brand's value. The brand might even license its use in other categories to find additional profit. As for the proposed product innovations, it remains to be seen whether there is a market for portion-controlled or better-for-you Twinkies.

For now, Twinkies continues ride the wave of snack food fans, happy to have Twinkies back in the starting line-up.
My wife put on a pot of coffee and leisurely enjoyed her Twinkies between sips. Although she is glad they are back, she doesn't think she'll buy them any more frequently than she has in the past and warned me that I shouldn't get in the habit of bringing home snack food for her consumption. And that was a domestic demonstration of the current brand challenge.

STDs More Common Than Thought
March 1, 2007 By LAURA OWINGS Like most young women, Jaime knew that unprotected sex could lead to sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy.
However, when she chose to have sex with her new boyfriend, she did so unprotected.
"I guess it was embarrassment," she says. "I waited for him to say something about it, and since he didn't, I didn't either."
It wasn't until months later that Jaime realized the enormity of her decision.
During a routine visit to her gynecologist, the doctor performed a pap smear "to check for STDs and be on the safe side," Jaime says.
"I remember her saying that everything looked fine, and that she'd be surprised if anything came back positive."
Days later, Jaime got a call informing her she had contracted chlamydia.
"I was devastated," says Jaime. "I was so angry with myself for not caring as much as I should about protection."
When it comes down to it, Jamie says she never thought the people she trusted enough to sleep with would have an STD.
"I thought I couldn't get an STD because I wasn't overly promiscuous, and I thought that only 'dirty' people got them."
STD Rates Continue to Rise
As many as 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases are diagnosed each year, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Nearly half of these infections are among young people ages 15 to 24 years old.
"This is a disturbing trend that we've been seeing for a while," says Eli Coleman, professor and director of the University of Minnesota program in human sexuality.
Chlamydia is the most commonly reported infectious disease in the United States, according to the CDC.
In 2006, more than 970,000 new cases of chlamydia were diagnosed -- a 51 percent increase from 2004.
Because chlamydia often goes undiagnosed, it can cause severe health problems. Up to 20 percent of those infected can become infertile.
Increasingly, other common STDs are being diagnosed in sexually active youths.
Herpes infects at least 45 million people 12 years old and older. The CDC says one out of five adolescents and adults have contracted a genital herpes infection.
Even syphilis, a disease that sounds like a long-gone medieval malady, has had a resurgence.
Syphilis infected more than 8,000 people in 2005 alone. Among women, this was the first time in more than 10 years those numbers had gone up.
A Growing Complacency
Even though we live in a so-called information age, experts agree that there is more to practicing responsible behavior than what you learn in classes and on TV.
"It takes more than broad public awareness campaigns; you need to want to protect yourself," says Coleman.
Because information about the risk for STDs tends to be theoretical, many take on the attitude that "this may happen to someone, but it won't be me."
"Some people think they are immune," says Jennifer Falotico Taylor, a clinical psychologist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
"They think there's going to be a pill, there's going to be a treatment. … The consequences may not be so bad."
Taking Charge of Sexual Behavior The risk of contracting an STD may sound benign, but it translates to a risk for infertility, painful sores or warts, and the stigma of carrying a disease for the rest of your life.
"People really need to think about consequences and think more positively about the advantages of protection," says Coleman.
For many, the opportunity to be intimate presents itself, and neither partner is prepared.
"Talking about responsible sexual behavior ruins the romance," says Taylor. The problem, she says, is protection "should have been part of the moment from the beginning."
To stop and say things can't go further without protection can be awkward and embarrassing.
But this kind of thinking "is a fundamental problem," says Coleman.
To take charge of the situation shows maturity and a level of respect and caring for the other person involved.
"We need to get to the point where being responsible about sexual behavior carries a sense of pride instead of embarrassment."

It's big business. If you saw the david blaine special on abc, you know it is getting a makeover. Larger than life magicians pulling off the ultimate balancing act to stay cutting edge. Are they risking too much? Tonight abc's cecelia vega disappears into their world. Reporter: What you are about to witness is magic unlike anything you have ever seen, illusionist david blaine drinking kerosene. All in the name of a trick that is just plain deadly. He spent more than 20 years trying to master this stunt despite warnings from every expert telling him not to try it. Did you get any of that into your lungs it will cause an inflammation of the lung which can cause severe damage. There is a chance that you could inhale some of this and you could die. Reporter: Then again this is the guy who famously froze himself to near death, held his breath underwater for 17 minutes. Fasted for 44 days, and buried himself alive. My stomach felt like it was on fire. Kerosene was dripping from my nose. I could hardly breathe. And tonight on an abc special, drinking all that kerosene he lived to tell once again. Kiddconsidered my first attempt a success because I made it through. Reporter: Blaine has made a name for himself pushing the limits of all that is humanly possible and audiences are eating it up. Wanting more from magicians turned celebrity stuntmen. To keep those audiences coming, the big names are taking even bigger risks pulling bigger rabbits out of even bigger hats. Tonight, we get a rare look behind the curtain. This is like really detailed. In las vegas, the capital of the billion dollar entertainment industry, the city where extreme magic sells. There is david copperfield, worth an estimated $800 million. Reportedly selling more tickets than any solo performer ever. He has walked through the great wall of china, even made the statue of liberty disappear. Yeah, that's me. On stage, right there with the magic man himself, power tools, hard hat and all, making my debut as a magician side kick. Copperfield shrinks, shrinks, and shrinks himself into almost nothing. An illusion that mystifies a packed house. Even copperfield admits he too has had to step up his game inment fin the face of fierce competition. I wonder how far you push yourself to make it better? To the point where it is dangerous? There is danger. Educated risks you. Have backup plans. Things do go wrong. Thing do's screw up. You are depending on lots of people who you trust and they're smart people, they're really well trained. Sometimes things go wrong. Reporter: Five years ago one of copperfield's assistants was severely injured on stage, pulled into a giant fan blade. Is there of a risk when it comes to safety having to raise the bar constantly? There could be a risk. Safety is number one priority. Reporter: The mgm grand president, scott cebelo was talking about copperfield's success but reluctant to talk about a cirque du soleil performer, a publicist cutting our interview short. Is it safe? It is very safe. Not about david copperfield. We are going to cover everything. If you want to elaborate on the point you are make. Reporter: This past month. Another performer at aria resort and casino was hospitalized following a stunt on the wheel of death. The topic is david copperfield. Reporter: You won't answer the question about cirque? I guess not. Reporter: Not one question. Would you just stick to david copperfield? Reporter: Okay. The danger doesn't just sell tickets. It is what drives these extreme magicians to go deeper and deeper into the danger zone. That is through your hand. There is no blood. When I would see houdini dangling off of a building. Evel knievel riding over a bus. Things that weredefying, there was danger. Things I liked the most. One of the risks of being a magici magician, do you have to go that far to sell tickets? I don't think to sell tickets. A matter of pushing your own boundaries of, what you expect of yourself. You know the audience of course, a big respect to the audience to treat them to not the same old thing. You want to respect them. And show them something that maybe will take them to another level. It is really, has to come from, has to come from here. They closely guard the secrets to their success. I had to promise not to reveal anything I witnessed under the bright lights of copperfield's magic show. The ceremony signing of the secrecy agreements. I have to sign this. What am I signing away here? Signing away. Read it first. Caller: Here's what I can say, if if the looks easy it is not. This is like really detailed here. Ay. Same thing again. Ready, guys? Reporter: Even the slightest move matters. Pretty damn good for ten-minute training purpose. Can we do one more time. Reporter: One wrong flick of the hand from me, I could lose a hand or mess the whole trick up. I am ready. Think I am ready. The power tool right there the I've will meet you right here. You are going to watch some of the show. Rush you back here. And don't screw up. Reporter: Don't mess up. Word of advice from david copperfield. Don't screw it up. With that they its show time. &#9834; &#9834; overshot it a little bit. Don't think anybody noticed. I know seek the rhcret. One secret copperfield will share, a look inside his off limits. Very bizarre collection of magic memorabilia. Five, four, three, two, one. Reporter: Oh! All 40,000 square feet. Wow. Ha-ha-ha. Reporter: Not the first person who said that. These are spikes I hung from a straitjacket, burning ropes. Reporter: True if you build a set what do you do with it? You want to keep it. Mostly. I keep everything. Reporter: Keep everything. A hoarder. Magic hoarder. Yes, celebrity hoarder. Me getting into a safe. And the safe. Rip Reporter: I remember that. The largest houdini collection jou outside of library of congress. We did escape things houdini inspired. His legacy doesn't need my help. Reporter: The famous saw. And this. The room that really freaked me out. Is this creepy at all to you? Have to admit it is a little creepy? A lot of people are creeped out. People really love it too. Reporter: The man who has perfected the disappearing act has no plans to disappear any time soon. When do you finally say, okay. Never. Never. Really? They'll carry me out on a gurney. Reporter: A trick or not? I may not have left. You know. Reporter: Fresh off his latest trick, blaine was back at it again to day. Diving in fish tanks and playing with fire. Working on a specific new project that tie don't want to talk about origin, it. Reporter: Here is hoping he survives his next new project. For "nightline." I'm cecelia vega in vegas. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
