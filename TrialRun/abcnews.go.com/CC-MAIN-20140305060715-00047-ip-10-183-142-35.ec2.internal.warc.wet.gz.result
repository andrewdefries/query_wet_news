Dugard Kidnapping Suspect Told FBI He'd Cured Himself
Aug. 30, 2009
By MIKE VON FREMD, KATE SNOW and STEPHEN SPLANE Phillip Garrido, the man accused of kidnapping Jaycee Dugard and holding her prisoner for 18 years, walked into the FBI field office in San Francisco two days before his arrest and handed over a letter describing how he'd cured his disturbing sexual behaviors and how the information could be used to assist in curing sexual predators.
The FBI spokesman in San Francisco told ABC News the rambling letter is very similar to the postings on Garrido's website.
The document that talks about cures for sexual predators and ways of "controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts."
Police in Contra Costa County, Calif., expanded their investigation into the 1991 kidnapping of Dugard this weekend.
