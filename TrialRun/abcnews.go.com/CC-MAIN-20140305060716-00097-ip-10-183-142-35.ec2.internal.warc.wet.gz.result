Beyonce and Jay-Z's Baby: New York Hospital Clears Up Rumors

A New York hospital where pop superstar Beyonce gave birth this weekend says that contrary to media reports, security for the couple didn't restrict other parents of newborns from access to their babies.
Lenox Hill hospital, where Beyonce and Jay-Z welcomed daughter Blue Ivy late Saturday night, was criticized after fellow patients at the hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side expressed outraged at the tight security measures put in place for the megastars.
"People [were] just telling us where we cannot go and locking us out of the NICU," one patient told New York's Daily News of the situation at the hospital over the weekend.
In a statement, representatives from Lenox Hill told ABC News, "No security plan that we, or the Carter's security team, put in place would have prevented or delayed families from gaining access to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)."
The hospital in a statement refuted reports that the couple paid to rent a floor of the building to ensure their privacy.
"Lenox Hill Hospital and its staff were delighted to welcome the Carter family for the birth of their firstborn on Saturday evening, but we are troubled by the misinformation being circulated in some news media reports," the statement read.
"The suggestion that the couple paid $1.3 million to rent an entire maternity floor is simply not true. The family is housed in an executive suite at the hospital and is being billed the standard rate for those accommodations.
"The family does have its own security detail on site. However, the hospital has been and continues to be in control of managing all security at the facility. We have made every effort to ensure minimal disruption to other families experiencing the births of their own children over the past three days, the hospital said.
One irate hospital guest, however, told the Daily News the security team repeatedly stopped him from visiting the NICU.
"These are children with problems in intensive care and you're just going to take over the hospital like you own it? All I want is an apology," Neil Coulon of Brooklyn told the newspaper.
The Daily News had initially reported the $1.3 million figure to seal off a wing of the hospital to assure their privacy.
The celebrity couple issued a statement on their daughter's birth Monday, saying her "birth was emotional and extremely peaceful, we are in heaven." They added that she was "delivered naturally," weighed seven pounds, and described her arrival as "the best experience of both of our lives."
In a new song entitled "Glory feat. B.I.C." posted on his website Monday, Jay-Z raps about the couple's pregnancy struggles, and reveals that they previously suffered at least one miscarriage.
ABC News' Sheila Marikar contributed to this report. More from ABC News

See More Everybody, "pop news." Here we go. So, when it comes to getting your driver's license, no one is exempt from going through the sometimes painful process. And that includes 007. Daniel craig had to endure a written test, pass a driving test and take a five-hour course on responsible, safe driving. This all just happened in the last month in new york. Hopefully, the teacher hasn't seen "skyfall" yet. It's not known what car he used for the road test. But probably not an aston martin. But that would have been cool if he did. Daniel craig in a five-hour class. On safe driving. And watched eight of those movies. I would have sat in class with him. Well -- anyway. In other "pop news." Just in time for thanksgiving, pepperidge farm stuffing cookies. A company called downtown's cookie company is made from actual herbed stuffing. So, are they savory? I have my fellow anchors here. This is the cookie. But it's a stuffing-flavored cookie, with cranberry surprise in it. The cranberry makes it great. Does it taste savory or sweet? Tastes like a cookie. These are brand-new. The reviews are in. The online reviews have been fantastic. I like it. Good. They're available from the downtown bakery in new york. And they are a wner is thanksgiving season. According to the "gma" team. And finally, enjoy and listen. Okay. This year for the first time, ever. Americans got to choose which turkey gets the presidential pardon. The turkeys, two turkeys, took to facebook, to make their cases. Cobbler, turkey a, is a proud strutter that likes cranberries and gobbler. Both turkeys at the w. Hotel. Not to worry. Actually, no matter which turkey is picked, apparently, we understand that both turkeys will live out their days at mt. Vernon, president george washington's estate in northern virginia. I got applause from angie. Angie approved of that story. Which you stole from me, i might add. You stole that one. We both loved that story.
