September Jobs Report Disappoints
Oct. 22, 2013 By SUSANNA KIM

New jobs report released. Getty Images
September's jobs report, delayed more than two weeks because of the government shutdown, was hardly worth the wait. Employers added just 148,000 non-farm jobs as the unemployment rate fell to 7.2 percent.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expected 180,000 job additions last month and unemployment to be unchanged at 7.3 percent.
"The employment report released this morning showed that the economic recovery continued its moderate pace during September," said Robert Murphy, associate professor of economics, Boston College. "Of course, the latest report is based on data from before the government shutdown and debt-crisis brinkmanship, and so to gauge any possible fallout from those events we must await the October numbers."
Employment in the wholesale trade, transportation, warehousing and construction industry rose. Jobs in the construction industry increased by 20,000 in September, after showing "little change" over the prior six months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The civilian labor force participation rate, at 63.2 percent, and the employment-population ratio at 58.6 percent, were unchanged last month.
The Labor Department's report for August showed only 169,000 jobs were added and unemployment fell to 7.3 percent, but Tuesday's report revised the number of jobs added to 193,000 for that month. Total non-farm payroll employment for July was revised lower to 89,000 from 104,000.
Lindsey Piegza, chief economist for Sterne Agee, said the September jobs numbers lacked a lot of meaning, in part, because of the late timing of the data.
"Ancillary reports suggest more of the same in September: a lackluster job market," she said.
She added that mediocre expectations were already factored into the report.
October's report, due out a week late on Nov. 8, will be closely watched to see if the "slump" of the last few months was short-lived and any if there were any effects of the two-week government shutdown.
"Of course, an outsized decline will almost certainly be blamed on the government shutdown, but the jobs market has been losing steam since the start of the year, well before the government shutdown was even being considered," Piegza said.
Today's jobs report reaffirms the Federal Reserve's position to hold monthly asset purchases steady at $85 billion a month, essentially taking "tapering" off the table for October and likely through December as well, Piegza said.
"The Fed is still waiting to see that noticeable improvement in hiring and it appears they are going to be waiting even longer," Piegza said. More from ABC News

Breast-Feeders Unite to Demand Their Rights
Nov. 22, 2006
By URSULA FAHY Inspired by an incident at a Burlington, Vt., airport last month, protesters held "nurse-ins" at airports around the country today to call attention to a woman's right to breast-feed in public.
On Oct. 13, after waiting several hours for a delayed Freedom Airlines flight out of the Vermont International Airport, Emily Gillette says she was kicked off the plane for breast-feeding her 22-month-old daughter.
A flight attendant allegedly told the 27-year-old mother the she offended her. The attendant then offered Gillette a blanket and asked her to cover up.
When Gillette balked, a ticket officer boarded the plane and escorted Gillette, her husband, Brad, and their daughter, River, off the plane, Gillette says. Gillette tells ABC News that she was humiliated, and felt incredibly helpless, given the environment.
"There are so many TSA guidelines, restrictions. … We step really carefully and we're much more aware of our behavior on airplanes," Gillette says.
As she was leaving the plane, Gillette reportedly asked the flight attendant, through tears, "Why are

White House Bungles Leak About GOP Leader Trashing Obama

The White House and Senate Democrats may need a refresher course on how to leak a juicy story.
The White House today was forced to backtrack on a rumor Obama administration officials started about a Republican House leader who purportedly insulted President Obama to his face, telling the president, “I cannot even stand to look at you.”
Turns out, it never happened. How do we know?
The same White House that was responsible for starting the buzz now says there was a “miscommunication” and a “misunderstanding.”
Here’s how it went down:
During The Shutdown:
House Republican leaders and committee chairmen met with the president at the White House to discuss the government shutdown and debt ceiling on Oct. 10. Vice President Joe Biden, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors also sat in on the meeting.
Sunday, Oct. 20:
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., wrote Sunday on Facebook that “Many Republicans searching for something to say in defense of the disastrous shutdown strategy will say President Obama just doesn’t try hard enough to communicate with Republicans. But in a ‘negotiation’ meeting with the president, one GOP House Leader told the president: ‘I cannot even stand to look at you.”
Wednesday, Oct. 23:
Aides to House Republican leaders denied any lawmaker made such a statement to the president, and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney even said that statement was not accurate.
“I looked into this and spoke with somebody that was in that meeting and it did not happen,” Carney said at the White House press briefing Wednesday.
“Senator Durbin’s accusation is a serious one, and it appears to have been invented out of thin air. The senator should disclose who told him this account of events, retract his reckless allegation immediately, and apologize,” said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Boehner.
A spokesman for Durbin later told news outlets that the Illinois senator stood by his statement.
Thursday, Oct. 24:
The Huffington Post reported that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told the Senate Democratic caucus about the alleged GOP insult last week. The report even said Reid laid the blame on Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, for the statement, which Sessions’ spokeswoman then denied.
“I don’t have anything to add beyond what I have said before – that the Congressman didn’t say that,” Torrie Miller, a spokeswoman for Sessions, told ABC News.
The White House then took the blame for the “misunderstanding.”
“While the quote attributed to a Republican lawmaker in the House GOP meeting with the president is not accurate, there was a miscommunication when the White House read out that meeting to Senate Democrats, and we regret the misunderstanding,” a White House official said Thursday.
So the question now in this game of whodunit: Who in the White House was responsible for the “miscommunication” between the White House and Senate Democrats?
ABC News’ Mary Bruce, Michael Falcone, and John Parkinson contributed to this report.
