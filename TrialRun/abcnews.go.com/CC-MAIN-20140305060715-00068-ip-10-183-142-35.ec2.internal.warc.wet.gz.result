Idaho Farmers Sue Monsanto Over GMO Wheat

The farmers, represented by a Boise law firm, filed the federal lawsuit Friday contending that Monsanto's development of Roundup Ready wheat resulted in increased production costs and lowered prices because the genetically engineered wheat is likely to infiltrate the non-genetically engineered wheat supply.

The farmers contend that Monsanto failed to take steps to make sure the genetically
