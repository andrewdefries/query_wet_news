Jane Green's Warm Chocolate and Banana Cake
Great for Dessert or as a Snack
From the kitchen of Jane Green
| 10 Comments
Cook Time: 30-60 min	Bestselling author Jane Green's newest novel, "Promises to Keep," tells the story of three women's friendship.
The novel includes several recipes. Here's Green's recipe for warm chocolate and banana cake.
Ingredients
1 cup plain baker's chocolate
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup sugar
3 eggs, beaten
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons cocoa powder
3 ripe bananas, mashed
Cooking Directions
Pre-heat oven to 350º F.
Melt the chocolate over a bain-marie (or my lazy way of VERY, VERY slowly melting in a microwave.)
Cream together the butter and sugar until pale. Add the eggs gradually while beating.
Stir the flour, baking powder and cocoa together and fold into the wet mixture Add the bananas and melted chocolate. Mix well.
Bake for 45 minutes.
