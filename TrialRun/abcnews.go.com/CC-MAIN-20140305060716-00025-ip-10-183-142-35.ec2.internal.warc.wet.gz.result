Punk and Hip Hop Photographs by Janette Beckman & David Corio
In the late 1970s, Janette Beckman and David Corio were freelance photographers for rival music weeklies in London: Melody Maker and New Musical Express, respectively. These were the largest circulation music papers, both hugely influential in a particularly fertile time in underground scene -- up-and-coming bands were desperate to grace their pages. "Catch the Beat: The Roots of Punk and Hip Hop Photographs" is a new exhibit at New York's Morrison Hotel Gallery that collects some of their more iconic images. Beckman shot this photo for the cover of the Police's first album, "Outlandos d'Amour," in a tunnel on London's South Bank in 1978. © Janette Beckman/Courtesy Morrison Hotel Gallery Punk and Hip Hop Photographs by Janette Beckman & David CorioIn the late 1970s, Janette Beckman and David Corio were freelance photographers for rival music weeklies in London: Melody Maker and New Musical Express, respectively.

Your mom was right about a lot of things: standing up straight, wearing clean underwear, and eating chicken noodle soup to cure all ills. We scanned the grocery shelves to find the best ones, weighing calories, sodium, and, of course, flavor.

See More And tomorrow is a new day in a new school for a group of children in newtown, connecticut. The sandy hook elementary school is in effect relocati moving teachers, students, even desks and backpacks into new quarters. A barrowed building, seven miles away. Children and teachers toured today and abc's amy robach explains. Amy? Reporter: It may take some extra time on the school bus tomorrow, but that ride may feel extra special. The streets leading to their new school lined with their school color, green, and signs of love and support. Snowflakes hang throughout the newly named building, sent in from around the world with messages of hope. In a matter of weeks, the community has been hard at work retrofitting a building originally designed as a middle school to meet the needs of younger students. Bathroom sinks and toilets were lowered and the gym remodeled. And in many classes, students will return to find the desks exactly as they left them. A great deal of thought and effort and volunteer work to make this as seamless as possible. At one point there were 80 people in the building cleaning up the building, doing the kinds of things, painting to make it look cheerful and happy. Reporter: There will be familiar faces, as well. Not only will students be reunited with their heroic teachers, sandy hook's new principal is actually its former principal, donna page, who retired just two years ago. When you return to familiarity, in a situation that feels really comfortable, that will really help restore your previous beliefs. Restore that world view that might have gotten shaken up by the trauma. Reporter: And officials also know the importance of restoring a sense of security, for everyone. Lieutenant, what makes this the safest school in america? Right now it has to be the safest school in america. We've actually installed numerous different security devices at this school and we are going to remain on presence until further notice. Reporter: Because everyone knows these first few days will be a balancing act between security and normalcy, parents will be allowed to come into the school and classroom with them and school officials someone else might help. The school's pet, shelley the turtle will be there welcoming students to class tomorrow. Diane? Thank you, amy. And we sure will be thinking of all of them in the morning.
