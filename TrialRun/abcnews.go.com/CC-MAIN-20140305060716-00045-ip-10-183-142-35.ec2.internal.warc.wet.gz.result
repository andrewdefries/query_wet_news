It is a Kirk's Dik-dik antelope, a rare type that is one of the world's smallest. The baby is being hand-reared at the zoo after its mother rejected it during recent cold weather there.Phil Noble/ReutersAmazing AnimalsTwo rare albino alligators from Louisiana are shown at La Ferme aux Crocodiles, a crocodile farm in Pierrelatte, in central eastern France.

PHILIPPE DESMAZES/AFP/Getty Images/Getty ImagesBaby Animals: Baby PandaIt's a boy. This baby panda was born at the San Diego Zoo on Aug. 5, 2009, and the zoo staff, anxious to leave the newborn alone with its mother, a Chinese-born panda named Bai Yun, did not get to examine the little guy for a month. A baby panda's sex is not obvious when you can only see it from a distance. Following Chinese tradition, the baby will not get a name until he is 100 days old.Ken Bohn/San Diego ZooBaby Animals: Baby PandaGeoff Pye, senior veterinarian at the San Diego Zoo, gives the new baby panda a checkup. The 2.8-pound cub is a boy, but the zoo staff couldn't tell until the baby had spent a month bonding with his mother, Bai Yun, and could be safely examined. A baby panda's sex is hard to determine from a distance.Ken Bohn/San Diego ZooBaby AnimalsCan you make out the newborn Chinese panda in this webcam picture from the San Diego Zoo? It's the four legged blob just above its mother, Bai Yun, and this image was recorded just after it was born in the early hours of Aug. 5, 2009. The zoo says it is best to leave the hairless, pink newborn alone to bond with its mother, so its sex cannot be known for some time. A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter.Courtesy San Diego Zoo
