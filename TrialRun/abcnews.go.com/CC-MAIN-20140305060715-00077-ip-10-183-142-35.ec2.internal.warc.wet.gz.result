Miranda Kerr Models Reebok's 'Lingerie' Sneakers
Supermodel Miranda Kerr models in an ad for Reebok's "Skyscape" shoes, which are made from the construction process similar to that of molded foam bras, Reebok says. The tag line for the ad states: "So comfortable you'll forget you have them on." The company says the "pillow-like" design of the sole was inspired by the home furnishings industry, while for the upper "came from the lingerie industry – and specifically, molded foam bras." In a statement, Kerr says, "I'm on the move all day so it's important to have a pair of shoes that balance comfort, style and practicality."
