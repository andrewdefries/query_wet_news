Transcript for Iran Nuclear Deal Offers Sanctions Relief for Nuclear Concessions

See More this historic deal with iran reached in the middle of the night. Secretary of state jn kerry and the foreign ministers from other five world powers all smiles in geneva, switzerland as they announced the deal in the wee hours, president obama then making a rare saturday night statement from the white house. Today that diplomacy open a new path to a world that's more secured. Future that we can verify that iran's nuclear program is peaceful. We should say here, not everyone agrees that this deal will make the world safer. Let's go straight to terry moran, right there in geneva, watching this whole thing play out. Terry, good morning. Terry, walk us through the nuts and bolts of this deal first. Reporter: Dan, what an extraordinary scene it was in the wee hours in the hotel behind me. This is a temporary deal but still a big deal. Iran has agreed to freeze much of its nuclear program and it has agreed to open key nuclear facilities to daily inspections by foreign officials. What does iran get? Money. 6 billion to $7 billion in sanctions relief. And finally, this is a temporary agreement, six months to buy time, build confidence, trying to achieve a comprehensive deal, as the president was describing. That's a far, far tougher thing to do, though. Terry, this has caused a major divide between the united states and israel. Israeli prime minister said that the world has become much more dangerous. Who's right here? Reporter: Well, that depends on what happens next, there's no question that israel and many critics of this deal, democrats as well as republicans in the united states, they don't want to see a freeze of iran's nuclear program, they want to see a rollback, a rollback to zero, no reactors going, no centrifuges enriching uranium. Netanyahu has made clear that he's willing to act unilaterally if he feels this deal doesn't work. Nonetheless, history in the making right there in geneva, switzerland, and our terry moran on the front lines. Terry, thank you. Much more on this historic news coming up later this morning right here on abc. On "this week" with george stephanopoulos as george speaks directly with secretary of state john kerry.

Small Business Issues Take Center Stage at Treasury

It's small business week on Wall Street and in Washington. In wake of yesterday's announcement by Goldman Sachs that the megafirm would devote $500 million of its bonus pool to small business development, the Obama administration is launching a new initiative today. Matt Jaffe has the details: With the nation's unemployment rate at a 26-year high, the Treasury Department Wednesday will host a forum on how to help small businesses survive the economic downturn. "Our economy is growing but jobs are not," an administration official told ABC News. "Unemployment remains a substantial challenge that requires sustained action, and any focus on jobs requires a focus on small business." The administration is currently winding down some of the economic rescue efforts implemented last year, but the official noted, "We know that for small businesses, the recession remains alive and acute. That is why we need to look at every possible step we can take to ramp up support for them." The forum, said the official, will give Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Small Business Administrator Karen Mills the chance to seek out the best ideas and strategies to take to the White House on how to increase access to financing for small businesses. It is also a chance to re-energize regulators, Congressional leaders, small business owners and lenders around the issue, the official stated. The forum, which President Obama called for last month, comes just weeks before the White House's December 3 forum on jobs growth and economic improvements. The president wants the administration to conduct as much outreach as possible on job creation before the budget process concludes later this year, the official said.
Along with Geithner and Mills, Wednesday's Treasury forum will also feature FDIC chief Sheila Bair and the chairs of the House and Senate committees handling issues involving small businesses. Following opening remarks by Geithner and Mills and the other featured panelists, a handful of small business owners will also speak. This panel includes Charles Baker of MCB Lighting Solutions in Owings Mill, MD; Andy Cabral, who runs 10 Dunkin Donuts in the DC area; Kevin Galvin of Connecticut Commercial Maintenance in West Hartford, CT; Lani Hay of Lanmark Technologies in Fairfax, VA; William Ortiz-Cartagena of Gentle Parking in San Francisco; Mike Tie of Paramount Building Solutions in Tempe, AZ; and Susan Walvius of SHEEX in Chapin, SC.
