Over-the-Counter Erectile Drugs Come With Health Risks
July 18, 2006 By ANDREA CARTER, ABC News Medical Unit Dr. Andrew Kramer recently looked over the medical history of one of his patients who had been in the emergency department complaining of chest pains.
Kramer was surprised by what he read: The patient had been taking three to four dietary supplements for erectile dysfunction -- every day.
"I would have never given him Viagra," said Kramer, a urologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center. "He was on the cardiac transplant list."
Heart patients are potentially at risk for a heart attack and an early death when they combine erectile dysfunction drugs, such as Viagra, with heart medications that contain nitrates, like nitroglycerine.
Both drugs lower blood pressure and together can lower it to deadly levels.
Normally doctors won't prescribe Viagra or Levitra to these men, but they can look elsewhere -- specifically, the Internet, where herbal supplements of all sorts are available for sale.
While some of these supplements may contain harmless ingredients, many are indeed as potent as the real thing.
A recent Food and Drug Administration study showed that som

Sex Pill to Help Women's Desire Shows Promise Nov. 16, 2009

In what is being hailed by some as the female Viagra, a new drug that failed to make it to market as an antidepressant is showing some hope for low libido in women.
In a multi-nation study made public Monday, the drug flibanserin appeared to increase desire and sexual satisfaction in women by several measures by modulating serotonin and other neurotransmitters.

Unlike Viagra, which is used to treat male erectile dysfunction by increasing blood flow to the genitals, this drug acts on the woman's brain to enhance mood.
Lead researchers from University of Ottawa -- underwritten by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals -- say the drug is effective in treating a newly coined condition known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) or lack of libido.
"This is a landmark study, and I think it's going to make a great difference for the quality of life for women throughout the world," said Dr. Elaine Jolly, director of the Women's Health Center at Ottawa Hospital in Canada. "This is just the beginning."
nullnull
The drug acts on the central nervous system, keeping serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine "in balance," she told ABCNews.com.
The Phase III placebo-controlled studies on flibanserin also raise questions about whether HSDD is a legitimate medical condition or another pharmaceutical company invention to sell drugs.
HSDD was classified as a disorder by the American Psychiatric Association in 2002 and is characterized by low desire, accompanied by "anxiety, guilt and relationships issues," according to Jolly.
"The pharmaceutical industry has come up with Viagra to solve a major concern that men have had since the beginning of time," said June Reinisch, senior research fellow at The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction.
"But until now, nobody has seemed that concerned about resolving what women might like."
Reinisch said while the study was "interesting," there were more questions about the data -- women surveyed were 18 to 50, a wide range, and from different countries.
There was also a very strong placebo effect among the women.
"We ladies are complicated, and this study is only looking at one thing," she said. "It may be a first step in something interesting, but to call it a female Viagra, we are getting way ahead of ourselves."
"Women are not interested in getting a hard on, they want to have desire and arousal," said Reinisch, who is also a consultant to New York's Museum of Sex.
The randomized, double-blind study on flibanserin was carried out in Canada's Women's Health Center of the Ottawa Hospital, as well as at University of Virginia, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Italy's University of Pavia.
Sexual Desire Improved in Study
Premenopausal women treated for 24 weeks showed significant improvements in sexual desire and functioning compared with those on a placebo.
The 1,378 study participants were required to be in a "stable, communicative, monogamous, heterosexual" relationship for at least one year.
All exhibited generalized acquired sexual dysfunction disorder or "little or no receptivity" to sexual activity. Those who had secondary problems with arousal or orgasm were excluded from the study, as well as those with psychiatric and depressive disorders or those who had taken medication that might diminish or enhance sexual function within four weeks prior to entering the study.

Columnist: It's How Votes Get Counted That Counts
March 31
CommentaryBy John Allen Paulos The Academy Awards are all over except for the incessant movie ads that will trumpet the results for months. But it's how the academy voted that has surprising connections to other topical issues.
The voting system used by the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences often has a pronounced effect on its selections. This may appear to be a rather myopic commentary on the Oscars that only a mathematician would make, but how one keeps score helps determine who wins not only in Hollywood, but in Palm Beach, in Salt Lake, and almost everywhere there are competitions.
No one has forgotten the many types of dimpled chad and the infamous butterfly ballots that clouded the presidential election of 2000. The Electoral College always generates controversy, and strategic positioning for the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries is already being discussed by potential candidates.
Everyone is aware, too, of the vagaries of Olympic figure skating scoring, where the judging was sometimes quite subjective, to say the least. Even in those racing events such as skiing and sledding, where the scoring was objective, the times were measured in imperceptible thousandths of a second, differences that were much less than those caused by the changing weather and course conditions that the athletes confronted.
In short, much often depends on such fine discriminations and arcane measurements.
Hollywood No Different
Hollywood is no different. The winners there were chosen by a plurality system whereby the nominated movies and artists receiving the most first-place votes received the Oscars. This sounds unobjectionable until one realizes that with five nominees for each award, the winner is unlikely to be a favorite of a majority of the voting member of the academy.
The nominees, however, were chosen by a more complicated system designed to ensure variety and, some argue, quality.
Roughly it goes as follows: Each of the members of the academy ranks up to five of his or her preferences, and those nominees who receive enough first-place votes are selected. Those with the fewest first-place votes are eliminated. The votes are then redistributed among the remaining candidates. Once again those with enough first-place votes are selected and the process continues until the nominees are selected.
An unappreciated mathematical point is that who the winners are depends as much on the system used as the votes cast. There's certainly nothing wrong with this. In fact, it couldn't be otherwise.
Different Methods, Different Winners
For illustration, consider the following imaginary scenario.
Let's reduce the numbers involved and say there were only three candidates for Best Actor and only 100 voting members. Assume that 37 members rated Denzel Washington (the real winner) their favorite, Russell Crowe their second choice, and Sean Penn their third. Further assume that 18 members rated Crowe first, Washington second, and Penn third, and that the remaining 45 rated Penn first, Crowe second, and Washington third. After the presenters exchange banter, the envelope is opened and …
If the academy uses the plurality system, then Penn, who has 45 first-place votes, wins handily.
If it first eliminates the nominee with the fewest first-place votes (Crowe) and has a runoff between the two remaining nominess, then the winner is Washington, whom 55 of the 100 voters prefer to Penn.
