See More Mick jagger said it best, you can't always get what you want. But when it comes to the food industry, what might fit better, is you can't always get what you think you're getting. With some of the tricks the trade is using, what can end up on your table isn't what the pilgrims had in mind or what you had in mind either. Here's jim avila. Reporter: We begin with a thanksgiving riddle. When are cranberries not cranberries at all? How about when they're dye d blue and put in your cereal bars, pretending to be blueberries. But it looks like there are real blueberries inside! What are those? Reporter: Can a turkey still be called natural when it's unnaturally pumped with a laboring solution, and what's a white tuna? White tuna doesn't exist. There is to species called white tuna. Reporter: As we approach thanksgiving, the celebration feast, we bring you food for thought. The even side word on those outside labels. The supermarkets are filled right now with the organic, fresh and natural. But is it still natural if the labeling also says the turkey has been injected with "a solution to enhance tenderness"? The usda says yes, a turkey may contain a solution of water, salt and other natural flavoring to enhance juiciness and tenderness as long as it's labeled and the solution is natural, the turkey is considered natural. Just remember you are paying turkey prices for the extra weight of water and salt. Now to the great cranberry/blueberry hoax. Sure they dress up any thanksgiving day spread, but every other day of the year cranberries can be found dressing up themselves like expensive blueberries. Some food manufacturers simply substitute one for the other. You should trust food manufacturers about as much as you would trust a used car salesman. Reporter: Michael jacobson's watchdog group has been battling big name companies for more accurate packaging for decades. It's a fight they are not winning. The labels are designed basically to trick consumers into buying the product. Reporter: He points to products like these "blueberry muffin frosted mini eats." A check of the ingredients reveals it has zero blueberries. This box of special k fruit and yogurt cereal features images of blueberries, blackberries and raspberries on the box, but the fruit inside the box is dried apples. Even pop-tarts, rarely confused as a healthy snack option, features a blueberry on its "wild berry" box. There are dried strawberries, apples and pears inside, but no blueberries in sight in the ingredients list. It doesn't have any blueberries in it. No, it doesn't. Reporter: Who is right? There are berries in the product but the blueberry flavored fruit pieces are actually made with -- there they are -- cranberries. I feel a little betrayed. Maybe it says something about us as a culture that we'll eat something that is not the real thing. Reporter: The words "naturally" age "article fishily flavored" can be found on the front of the package though much smaller than the big juicy blue berri berries. The good print giveth, and the small print taketh away. That's sufficient to comply with the law, a small company would say. Reporter: The bait and switch. What happens when there's no box to read, no list of ingredients. In other words, what about seafood? Americans love their fish, consuming more than 4.7 billion pounds of it last year. But an abc investigation reveals consumers often don't get what they pay for. If you go to los angeles and eat red snapper every day for the next 30 days, you will never see red snapper. Odds are very, very long about it if you just pick a random restaurant. Reporter: All over america, consumers are being overcharged for less desirable fish and served seafood different from the one on the menu. I'm a marine biologist, I've been eating fish for years, and you put a nice cream lemon sauce on it, I don't think anybody can tell the difference. Reporter: Mislabeling can be profitable. Just look what a little creative branding can do. Ocean percn masquerading as red snapper. The numbers don't add up. 40,000 fish of copper river salmon were sold last year. Well, sorry, but only 1200 fish were actually caught in copper river last year. Reporter: Chef barton seaver is an author, national geographic fellow and a graduate of the prestigious culinary institute of america. He recently purchased a container of world famous maryland blue crab -- or so he thought. These are big lumps. Reporter: He sent a picture of the crab to a friend at the maryland tate fisheries and got a two-word reply. It's asian. Reporter: Clearly to him right away. Clearly to him right away and it was embarrassing to me almost because this is my life. This is what I do and yet I had even been duped. Reporter: Duped into paying more for what he says is an inferior product that came not from maryland, but from indonesia. What we found in our abc news investigation that began 18 months ago is shocking. We collected sushi in major cities. The white tuna and super white tuna samples were then sent to nova southeastern university in florida for testing. Each compared against a broad dna database of fish species to see if they were tuna at all. So collectively it's an 86% substitution rate, which is really remarkably high. 86% of white tuna turned out to be something completely different. Reporter: That's right, nearly nine out of ten white tuna sushi was not tuna at all. That couldn't be right, so we went back to the same new york city restaurants, bought more sushi and sent those in to be analyzed. And again, the testing revealed nearly all of the white tuna samples were really escolar, aka the "ex-lax" fish. This fish contains chemicals called waxy esters that can cause gastrointestinal distress. Reporter: The findings did not surprise dr. Michael hirschfield who conducted a much larger test for oceana with similar results. I would be astonished if anyone buying white tuna or super white tuna at a sushi restaurant, got anything other than escolar. Reporter: More numbers that are hard to swallow. 85ll fish eaten in this country is imported, and yet less than 2% is actually fda inspected. And that's the problem. There is no traceability in the system. So it's not just I can't tell you what species it is, I can't tell you how it was farmed or to what standards it was produced. I can't guarantee the safety of that and that's really why people should care. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Amanda Knox Prosecutor Warns of Media Interference in Trial
PERUGIA, Italy Sept. 23, 2011

Amanda Knox and her family endured a day arguments by prosecutors today who retraced their accusations against her, presented grisly autopsy photos of murder victim Meredith Kercher, and warned jurors that a media campaign was interfering with Italian justice.
Knox entered the courtroom this morning looking tense and anxious as the summations in her appeal began. Knox has gotten her hopes up that the appeal will exonerate her and allow her to go home to Seattle after four years in an Italian prison. She obviously is also afraid that her appeal could be denied.
"I was worried about Amanda because she was understanding every word, lies about her," her mother Edda Mellas said at the conclusion of the day's legal procedings. "I knew it would be hard for her."
Her mother said she saw Knox briefly during a break. "I told her to hang in there. She said she was okay," Mellas said.
"It's emotionally draining because we worry about Amanda," Mellas added.
Her father, Curt Knox, said of the prosecutors' arguments, "It's a struggle to deal with. We knew it was coming and hopefully she will be strong enough to endure it."
Amanda Knox Prosecutor Claims Media Interference in Trial
Knox, 24, and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 27, were convicted in 2009 of murdering Knox's British roommate Meredith Kercher. They have been in prison since shortly after Kercher's partially nude body was discovered with her throat slashed in November 2007.
There has been growing speculation that Knox and Sollecito could win their appeal and be freed because court appointed experts have raised damaging questions about the prosecution's DNA evidence.
Prosecutors, however, appeared determined to keep Knox in prison to finish serving her 26 year prison sentence.
A reporter's odyssey with Amanda Knox
Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini stated that there has been "heavy interference" in the trial, a thinly veiled reference to the recent press coverage of the appeal, and urged the panel to proceed with their deliberations in a "rigorous way."
He took a bare knuckle approach in defending his case and began the summation by almost immediately presenting the jury with a slideshow of photos that included pictures of bloodstains in the house where Kercher died as well as photos of Kercher's slashed body. The blood-filled pictures included close-ups of the wounds. Several jurors looked away.
The slideshow also included a picture of Knox and Sollecito outside the cottage that had been shared by Knox, Kercher and two Italian women. The behavior of Knox and Sollecito -- either cuddling or supportive depending on who is describing it -- was an issue in the original murder trial. Knox's lawyer objected to the photo being used in court in this way and judge agreed with him.
The prosecutors reviewed much of the circumstantial evidence surrounding the case and said, "All clues converge toward the only possible result of finding the defendants guilty."
They also appealed for the jurors to not be swayed by the press coverage that has been critical of the prosecution's handling of evidence and what is perceived to be a growing sentiment for Knox and Sollecito. Mignini called it "media clamor," and added, "This is not a media fiction... This case has to tried and decided here."
Mignini warned of what he called "systematic denigration of the Italian justice system in the media," and scathing criticism of the DNA evidence surrounding a knife that was allegedly the murder weapon and Kercher's bra clasp that allegedly had Sollecito's DNA on it.
"Don't commit a grave error..it would be unforgivable," Mignini warned. "It's not just about the knife and the bra clasp. There are lots of other things."
The prosecutor spoke emotionally of the day he was called to the Perugia cottage to begin his investigation.
"I still remember the wide open eyes of the victim, and the composed, immense pain of her parents," he said.
Another prosecutor, Giancarlo Costagliola, urged the jury, "As you make your decision, I wish that you jurors feel a little bit like the parents of Meredith Kercher, a serious, studious girl whose life was taken by these two kids from good families."
A team of prosecutors is expected to present its case through today and into Saturday. A lawyer for Kercher will also get to make a summation before lawyer for Knox and Sollecito get to speak. Before the jury retires to consider a verdict, Knox and Sollecito will get to make statements on their own behalf. A verdict is expected in the early days of October.
The Knox family has told ABC News they are trying to keep their emotions and hopes in check. Knox's stepfather Chris Mellas called it a "combination of dread and hope."
Edda Mellas told "Good Morning America, "We are not going to celebrate until she walks out, but definitely we are feeling this could be the end of the nightmare."

Amazing Animals From Around the World A 5-foot Nile monitor lizard wandered around the patio of a home in Glen Ridge, Fla., according to ABC News' affiliate WPBF in West Palm Beach, Fla. Monitor lizards, which can exceed seven feet in length, seemed to be popping up with some regularity in South Florida in June 2011. Nine giant lizards were seen in central Palm Beach County, with additional unverified reports in central Broward County. While the reptiles are native to Africa, they have lived in Florida for a decade. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, monitor lizards are particularly active during the warm, summer months. (WPBF.com )

'This Week' Transcript: Sens. Leahy and Hatch
May 3, 2009 Page 14 of 16
STEPHANOPOULOS: And that comes back to, Gwen, the social issues. The Republicans can unify around a lot of the economic issues, around the principle of liberty. But when you bring the social issues to the table, gay marriage, abortion, the environment to some extent, that's where a lot of the young Republicans are saying, we have to have more moderation here.
IFILL: Well, and that's where the danger of those five words that George was talking about comes, because it doesn't -- there's not a period after Congress shall make no law. It continues. And -- I spent the past week in St. Louis, talking to people who kind of aren't in our bubble and are watching this very carefully, and who didn't necessarily vote for Barack Obama. I mean, Missouri is the one battleground state he didn't win. And they seem to be really patient with the possibility of government's role.
Now, they're a little nervous about the deficits, a lot of folks. They're a little nervous about the spending, but they are also saying, completely in sync with the polls we've been reading, that they think maybe this might work, or they don't know where else to go. But I don't think telling these people that we're going to say no to everything, to every possible solution is the message that Republicans really mean to send.
STEPHANOPOULOS: One of the president's solutions that's not so popular is one that he had to deal with this week, and that was the bankruptcy of Chrysler, and the president seemed quite defensive about the fact that the government was taking so many -- such a large stake in so many private businesses at his press conference on Wednesday, and he was actually asked about what kind of a shareholder he would be.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: I don't want to run auto companies. I don't want to run banks. I've got two wars I've got to run already. But I know that if the Japanese can design an affordable, well-designed hybrid, then doggone it, the American people should be able to do the same. So my job is to ask the auto industry, why is it you guys can't do this?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WILL: I assume the president is talking about the Prius. It's affordable because Toyota sells it at a loss, and it can afford to sell it at a loss because it is selling twice as many gas-guzzling pickup trucks of the sort our president detests. So as an auto executive, he's off to a rocky start.
Let me ask people around this -- this question. If the UAW will own 39 percent of General Motors and the government is going to own 50 percent, how do you negotiate? You've got a government in part elected by the UAW negotiating with the UAW? And then there's Chrysler. If Chrysler is going to be owned 55 percent by the UAW, is the UAW on both sides of the table when they negotiate a contract?
KRUGMAN: Well, this is ultimately -- all of this is going to depend on the continuing inflow of money from Washington, so ultimately, you know, the government is the shareholder. And that's the point in a way.
Now, in a way, that's probably going to ensure tougher bargains, because this is tremendously unpopular. Nobody wants to do that.
(CROSSTALK)
STEPHANOPOULOS: The president will drive a hard bargain. The UAW had to give a lot of concessions.

See More As we come to air, 12 states are bracing for yet another night of powerful storms, lightning hail, and high winds. This after last night's destruction. These snapshots you see, tell the tale, an almost impossibly large storm cloud, consumes the horizon. America virtually under siege by mother nature. Abc's meteorologist ginger zee tracking it for us. What's next? I just got back from an area that was hardest hit, elmira, new york. They had a tornado, one of three, more than 400 severe weather reports in all. Reporter: Spectacular storms -- almost 400,000 lightning strikes from missouri to connecticut. I heard a crack and I'm, like, it was a telephone pole, and wires were still live. Reporter: With the lightning, came heavy rain. Winds up to 75 miles per hour. The sky was pitch black, watching the trees fall. It was chaos. Reporter: And three ef-1 tornadoes packing winds up to 110 miles per hour. One was in montrose, pennsylvania, the other two north in new york state. Carol martin and her family were home when a twister hit elmira, new york. The tree comes smshing right through the house. Reporter: Have you ever seen anything like this? Never in my 51 years. I've never seen anything like Reporter: The line of extreme weather marching east was more than 1,300 miles long. And within it, serial derechos. Storm clusters shaped like a backward "c." They are powerful, long-lasting, lines of thunderstorms that produce very high wind gusts. These monsters can be more dangerous than ordinary storms because the damage they cause can be hundreds of miles long. Today, half a dozen states are cleaning up -- 100-year-old trees splintered, streets inundated and thousands still without power. We're out just seeing what we can do to help out to get lines back connected to the houses. Reporter: Tonight more storms are in the forecast and in the area that you're figure to see in the highlighted map, include places like detroit, louisville, d.C., Raleigh, through the southeast into atlanta. But we're looking for winds up to 70 miles per hour, large hail and frequent lightning, which can be just as dangerous as the rgs. That is through tonight and clears through the weekend. Some of the images we saw within that piece. The lightning, incredible over the new york skyline. I want to point out, see how some of the lightning bolts go from cloud to ground. And some cloud to cloud. That intercloud lightning can mean a storm is maturing or just past maturing and decaying. So even though it looks ominous, it can mean the storm is dying out. Impressive and good news. We'll see you on "good morning america" tomorrow. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Google's Project Glass is Ready, but for Developers' Eyes Only - ABC News
Google Glasses Go Public, Almost
Joanna Stern (@joannastern) Jan 16, 2013, 12:19 PM
Image credit: Joanna Stern / ABC News Let's start with the good news: Google's about to start to talking a bit more about its Project Glass this month - you know, those futuristic, Internet-connected glasses that show digital information right in front of your eyes, projected over the physical world.
The bad news? For the moment, they're just for software developers.
The company is holding two events - one in New York City and another in San Fransisco - where it will give software developers an early look at the spectacles. "Join us for an early look at Glass and two full days of hacking on the upcoming Google Mirror API in San Francisco or New York," Google said in an email invite it sent out to those who signed up to be on its developers list. These software and app creators will get a device to use on site and will come up with different software ideas and tie-ins.
MORE: Google Glasses Designer Gives Us An Up-Close Look "These hackathons are just for developers in the Explorer program and we're calling them the Glass Foundry," the invite goes on to say. Nope, the average Joe can't show up to see the glasses or take them home. Over the last few weeks, some have been spotted wearing the glasses around New York City. One tester was wearing a pair with prescription lenses.
"We're looking forward to what developers will do with Glass, but we don't have more details to share at this time," said a Google spokesperson when ABC News asked about the upcoming events.
At Google's I/O conference in June, Google co-founder Sergey Brin announced that prototypes or "Explorer Editions" of the glasses would be sold to developers for $1,500 in early 2013. Click for the video Google released last year to show the possibilities of Glass.
