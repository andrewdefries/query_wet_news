North Korea's Key to Olympic Medals: Refrigerators For Winners, Labor Camp Threat for Losers
SEOUL, South Korea Aug. 2, 2012

Secret to North Korea's Olympic Success
Bang was a student athlete in Taewondo in the North. Training involved four hours of "ideological education" per week aimed at cultivating loyalty to the leader.
"They play with a different mind set," said another North Korean defector to the South, Kim Yo-Han. "An absolute loyalty towards the country and the leader is the core foundation of the North Korean athletes' sportsmanship."
Kim's father was a soccer coach and mother was a rhythmic gymnastics coach in the North.
Upon returning home, gold medal athletes like Kim Un-Guk and An Gum-Ae would be rewarded with handsome prize money, an apartment, a car, and additional perks like refrigerators and television sets.
But most of all, they will be rewarded with a huge jump in social status with the title of "hero" or "people's athlete."
But poor performances, especially losing to their archenemy nations like the United States or South Korea, have consequences. Rumors of athletes being sent directly to labor camps upon arriving home are not confirmed, but it is a common procedure to open "review meetings" after the sports events in which participants "assess" their own and each other's games, said Kim Yo-Han.
If during that process the person is determined "disloyal" to their Dear Leader, the athlete is likely to be expelled from the sports organization and at times sent to labor camps.

Water in Ageing Spacesuit Caused Problems for Astronaut
Dec. 22, 2013

NASA's Mission Control has revealed the problem that prompted the early end of the latest spacewalk: Water in one of the astronaut's 35-year-old spacesuits.
Expedition 38 Flight Engineer Rick Mastracchio and fellow astronaut Michael Hopkins ran into trouble while they were conducting an urgent repair outside the International Space Station during a spacewalk that lasted five hours and 28 minutes.
The spacewalk ended short of its anticipated six-and-a-half-hour time frame when Mastracchio, the lead spacewalker, began complaining about chilly temperatures in his space suit.
The seven-time spacewalker said his feet were cold during at least part of the nearly five-and-a-half-hour walk and at times had to re-adjust temperature controls in his suit.
Even before the emergency repair mission began, NASA acknowledged it was working with aging spacesuits, which were designed in the same era of the space shuttle.
"Because the suits are 35 years old we review the hazards every so often as a matter of course," NASA's ISS Program Manager, Mike Suffredini told ABC News Radio.
The astronauts began working at 7:01 a.m. ET on Saturday to replace a degraded ammonia pump module associated with one of the station's two cooling loops that keep internal and external equipment cool, NASA said.
The engineers raced to successfully remove, ahead of schedule, the cooling pump that has jeopardized operations aboard the ISS since it broke on Dec. 11.
The 780-pound pump is about the size of a double-door refrigerator and difficult to handle, with plumbing full of toxic ammonia, The Associated Press reported. Flight controllers tried but failed to fix the bad valve through remote commanding.
During the repairs, the astronauts communicated with Mission Control Houston about the procedure. NASA's website offered the public a live video feed showing the astronauts and Mission Control.
At one point, when Mission Control asked Mastracchio to extend the spacewalk, he balked.
"My vote would be to call it for today, but it's up to you guys if you really want to go out there," Mastracchio said.
The work of the two astronauts Saturday was part of a planned series of spacewalks to replace the ammonia pump module.
While the astronauts successfully removed the pump on Saturday, plans to replace it two days later have been delayed. The pair will now spend Christmas Eve trying to finish the work, after NASA cancelled Monday's spacewalk to investigate what caused the latest malfunction.
NASA says a third spacewalk would occur on Christmas Day if necessary to finalize the installation of the replacement pump module. It would be the first Christmas spacewalk for NASA.
Mastracchio has conducted six previous spacewalks, and holds the record for the 14th longest total number of spacewalking hours. He wore extra safety gear to prevent a recurrence of helmet flooding that nearly drowned an Italian astronaut last summer. This was Hopkins' first spacewalk.
The two astronauts received guidance on the spacewalk procedures from NASA astronauts Doug Wheelock and Tracy Caldwell-Dyson, who replaced the pump at the same location during three spacewalks in August 2010, NASA said.

Good Samaritan Lends Helping Hand to Stranded Traveler
Jan. 6, 2010
By SADIE BASS via Dean Germeyer, a Chicago businessman, is being a called a hero. After hearing that a 79-year-old woman he befriended on a flight from Dallas would be stranded at O'Hare Airport overnight with no money and a bad hip, he invited her to dinner and put her up in a hotel. Jean Lachat/Chicago Sun-Times
Elsie Clark was stranded and having one of the worst day of her life -- she was one of so many passengers who couldn't get where she wanted to go.
Clark was traveling to her home in Winnipeg after spending Christmas with family in Texas. The 79-year-old, who uses a wheelchair, was stranded at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport after an airport employee left her at the wrong terminal and she missed her flight.
null
Weak and exhausted, she finally made it onto another flight scheduled to stop over in Chicago. Onboard, a pair of shiny shoes on a man across the aisle caught her eye, and she struck up a conversation.
The man, Dean Germeyer, who runs a computer software consulting company in Chicago, learned of Clark's difficulties, and quickly began arranging for a wheelchair to meet them on the ground.
"You could see this 79-year-old woman is someone's mother, someone's grandmother and she needed someone to help her out," Germeyer said.
Once on the ground, he helped her rush to the terminal for her connecting flight -- they were too late. There was no flight home until 7 the next morning, and Clark figured she'd have to sleep at the airport, but that wasn't the case.
"I think a lot of people, what their underlying message is that they're hoping that someone would be there if their parents or grandparents needed help," Germeyer said.
He called home and told his wife, Nina, to expect an extra guest for dinner.
"Dean eats a lot, so we had plenty of food to go around," Nina said.
After dinner, Germeyer escorted Clark on a tour around the city and then booked and paid for a hotel room near his building. He also arranged for a car to pick her up and return her to the airport the next morning to fly home.
"Meeting a man like him, it's unbelievable," said Clark. "I will never forget him, never forget him… So what do you say? You say, 'thank you' and it's not even enough."
"It was a really small act on my part and a response that's overwhelming," said Germeyer. "Elsie's a special lady. We connected and that's why it worked out so well for everybody." -- This embed didnt make it to copy for story id = 9496380.
