12 Baffling Medical Conditions
May 20, 2009 Page 7 of 8
But such was the experience of Stacey Gayle. Worse, the song that brought about her seizure was by dancehall reggae artist Sean Paul -- a favorite or hers.
"It was terrible," Gayle, a 24-year-old New Yorker, told ABCNews.com. "It didn't even have to be that loud."
One of Gayle's first music-induced seizures happened at a cookout where the song "Temperature" was being played. Some time after this, she had a similar experience at a restaurant.
The seizures were so bad that Gayle finally had part of her brain surgically removed in an effort to control her problem.
"She realized her life was going out of control with these seizures happening," said Dr. Ashesh Mehta, the director of epilepsy surgery at Long Island Jewish Medical Center.
Mehta recalled meeting Gayle in February to discuss her condition. When Gayle's mother played '"Temperature" on an MP3 player for her daughter to hear, a music-induced seizure followed.
"It was amazing to me," said Me

On Gay Marriage, Is Obama a Brave Warrior or a Political Late-Comer?
May 17, 2012
Page 2 of 2
"It's a struggle for many people," she said. "His struggle and his being honest and open about that, I think, will help others have the conversation — whatever conclusion they reach."
The tangible effects of Obama's comments are still being weighed. He endorsed no legislation, federal or local, and gave no indication that he wants to get his hands dirty in the issue while the economy is the top priority for voters.
Four states have gay marriage on their ballots: Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington. Obama's backing for gay marriage certainly emboldens supporters of the cause, but how those advocates harness the president's message into support in the polling booth is a different matter.
"The fact that the president has helped create a moment where we have this conversation, I think, will help in each of those states," Stachelberg said. "People will figure out how to take advantage."

Transcript: Rahm Emanuel and Rep. John Boehner
April 19, 2009 Page 3 of 9
STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about the big issues. On health
care, on Republican idea on health care is to tax employer benefits.
The president blasted Senator McCain for that idea during the
campaign, yet it's now being joined by some Democrats as well.
Is the president willing to consider that as a way to pay for his
plans to expand coverage?
EMANUEL: George, the goal -- well, remember, first of all,
what's the objective?
The objective is getting...
(CROSSTALK)
STEPHANOPOULOS: ... I want to know if he's willing to consider
that as a way to pay for it.
EMANUEL: Well, first of all, what we have to do is squeeze out
all the basic costs in the system, before we talk about any other type
of revenue. There's a lot that has to be changed.
Unfortunately, I know a little about health care reform from my
family.
The fact is, we had all the wrong incentives in the health care
system. And if you change the incentives toward medical I.T., which
we put in place the resources to start basically having a way to
control costs there; if we change the way the doctors are paid -- so,
rather than fee for service, for outcomes; change the way -- in fact,
rewarding people who take care of themselves and get their health
together.
All those are what you have to consider...
(CROSSTALK)
STEPHANOPOULOS: But all of that is only going to get you a
fraction of the place where you need to be in order to cover everyone
as the president has said is the goal as well.
And he laid out a plan, a reserve package of about $600 billion;
the plan he laid out to pay for it, shaving deductions for wealthy
Americans.
Democrats and Republicans alike on Capitol Hill say, no way,
we're not going to do it. So how is the president going to fill the
gap?
How is he going to pay for the programs?
EMANUEL: Well, (inaudible) George, it's not just the president.
It's what we work with Congress. That process is beginning. I think,
in this next five weeks, you'll see tremendous progress at the -- at
the committee level, to getting that done.
And he does not believe that's the first step. And what you have
to do, as he believes, is make the cuts in the system that we have
today because we're overpaying for a lot of things; and second, is
change the incentives before you get to immediately going to a default
position that you have to raise taxes.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But is he open to taxing employer benefits?
EMANUEL: He -- he has said he opposed that, as he said in the
campaign. And that's what he believes, and believes is, before you
get there, you have got to address the priorities.
STEPHANOPOULOS: So he won't sign a bill that includes that?
EMANUEL: George, I'm not going to do any absolutes on your show.
That's not my right to do that. If there's (inaudible) then we'll try
to arrange that...
(CROSSTALK)
STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's move over to energy. The president made a
major announcement -- the EPA made a major announcement on Friday,
giving the EPA the ability to regulate greenhouse gases.
It drew some sharp opposition from our next guest, Congressman
Boehner.
Here's what he had to say. He said, "This decision is nothing
more than a back-door attempt to enact a national energy tax that will
have a crushing impact on consumers, jobs and our economy. The
administration is abusing the regulatory process to establish this tax
because it knows there are not enough votes in Congress to force
Americans to pay it."

Miami Face-Eating Attacker Had No Human Flesh in Stomach
The Miami man whose vicious face-eating attack left his victim with his eyes, nose and mouth chewed off may not have been a cannibal after all.
An autopsy of Rudy Eugene's body found there was no human flesh in his stomach, just a few undigested pills, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The pills have not been identified and it will takes weeks to complete toxicology tests on them, the newspaper reported.
Eugene, who authorities suspect may have been high on a dangerous new street drug known...Full Story
