McFadden: I just want to ask you one other question about your health. I know there's no other plans for future public service, but if there were to be, would you feel comfortable making a pledge that you would release to whatever records--
Clinton: Oh of course, that doesn't bother me. I mean, that's just something that goes with the territory.
McFadden: Let's talk for a moment about Benghazi it seemed as though you lost your temper at the hearing momentarily the other day.
Clinton: Well, I believe that we should, in public life, whether you're in the administration or the congress, de-politicize crisis and work together to figure out what happened, what we can do to prevent it and then put into place both the institutional changes and the budgetary changes that are necessary. And the majority of the panelists in both the House and the Senate, I thought, were very constructive, asked sensible questions that deserved answers, but when someone tries to put it into a partisan lens, when they focus, not on the fact that we had such a terrible event happening with four dead Americans but instead what did somebody say on a Sunday morning talk show, that to me is not in keeping with the seriousness of the issue and the obligation we all have as public servants.
McFadden: Do you regret "what difference at this point does it make?" It has been so analyzed in the moment since you said it.
Clinton: No, because I think asking questions about talking points for a Sunday morning talk show is really missing the point. The accountability review board, chaired by Ambassador [Thomas] Pickering and Admiral [Michael] Mullen didn't pay any attention to that. They looked at what we could have done, what we have to do in order to prevent this in the future and remember, there have only been two of these accountability review boards for the time since 1988 ever made public. All the others have been made classified. I believe in transparency. I said, "let the chips fall where they may, put it all out there," and I don't want that to be politicized. I want it to serve as a framework for working together between the administration and the congress to keep our people safe.
McFadden: So you stand by what you said?
Clinton: Absolutely.
McFadden: You've repeatedly said that [Syrian] President [Bashar] Assad needs to go.
Clinton: Right.
McFadden: Starting two years ago--
Clinton: Right.
McFadden: And yet 60,000 Syrians are dead and he is still in office. What does it take for America to intervene?
Clinton: Well, I think we have been very actively involved. Until recently there was no credible opposition coalition and I can't stress strongly enough how important that is. You cannot even attempt a political solution if you don't have a recognized force to counter the Assad regime. It took them off the hook. It gave the Russians and others who are still either supporting them or on the fence, the ability to say, "well there's no opposition." We worked very hard to help stand up such an opposition.
McFadden: But is there a red line, Secretary Clinton--

'This Week' Transcript: Hoyer, Boehner and Bill Gates
June 13, 2010 Page 2 of 15
There was no indication this was going to happen. And I'm asking myself, why is this happening on Saturday night?
Fact is that the spending spree in Washington is continuing to run unabated. The American people are screaming at the top of their lungs, "Stop!" And -- and to move this without finding other offsets in spending, I think, is irresponsible. It's just putting more debt on the backs of our kids and our grandkids, and it really begs the question is, why don't we have a budget this year?
You know, we've not cut -- the House has failed -- not failed in the modern era to move a budget. And this appears to be the first time in the modern era that the House is not even going to consider a budget.
TAPPER: Well, Leader Hoyer, if I could...
(CROSSTALK)
TAPPER: ... if I could say, one of the -- the theory is that you don't want to make vulnerable Democrats vote for another spending bill, and that's why for the first time since 1974 there isn't going to be a House budget. Is that not true?
HOYER: Whatever -- whatever the theory may be, Jake, the fact of the matter is, my friend, Mr. Boehner, voted for $2 trillion during the Bush administration of unfunded spending. So when he says this cascade of spending, he...
(CROSSTALK)
TAPPER: But you agree that this should be offset with spending cuts?
HOYER: I would hope that we could do that, yes. However, what I said was, money that has already been appropriated in the Recovery and Reinvestment Act that has not yet been spent could be spent now on these priority items. Nobody wants to see $300,000 teachers or fire and police laid off. That's not good for the economy; it's not good for our kids; it's not good for the safety of our communities.
So the president's absolutely right in terms of this being critically important spending, and we're going to work on getting that. I personally believe that if we have dollars that are not yet expended in the Recovery Act that we can apply to this immediate need and then look to later expenditures in the long term for investments, I think we ought to do that. But we can't -- we can't stimulate and depress at the same time.
TAPPER: I'd like to -- I'd...
BOEHNER: Jake, every family knows that in a tough time it's more important to have a budget, not less. And if you think that they're going to move a budget on Capitol Hill, you must obviously believe that Elvis is still alive.
TAPPER: Well, I'd -- I'd like to move on to another topic...
HOYER: I know you do...
TAPPER: ... other than Elvis.
HOYER: ... but as you know, the Republicans didn't have a budget in '02, '04, '06.
BOEHNER: The House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era.
HOYER: And the American public had no idea about that, budgets that pass...
BOEHNER: Well, this is a great opportunity...
HOYER: ... and spending bills that follow (ph).
BOEHNER: ... to cut spending and to get the economy going again.
HOYER: And we're doing that.
BOEHNER: That's why I gave the president...
HOYER: Let me close with this.
BOEHNER: ... a letter this week with -- 100 economists signed a letter saying that cutting spending now will, in fact, help get the economy moving again, get jobs back...
(CROSSTALK)
TAPPER: I would like -- in terms of getting things moving again, I would like to move to another topic...
