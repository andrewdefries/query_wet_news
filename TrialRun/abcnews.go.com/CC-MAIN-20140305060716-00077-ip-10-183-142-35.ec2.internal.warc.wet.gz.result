Transcript for Singer Takes on Son's Suicide, Daughter's Coming Out in Book

"The key is love: My mother's wisdom, a daughter's... See More I'm over here with marie osmond. In her private life, more than her share of pain. She's written about the touch stone that's guided her up and down. "The key is love: My mother's wisdom, a daughter's gratitude" is out today. Great to see you. Great to see you. So fun. Fun to be here. It's really quiet in here. You and brad arrived at the same time. Yes, I tweeted, I said I was here with kenny chesney, april fool's. He took it well. He's so darling. I leafed through the book over the weekend. It's lovely. V very honest. It came to life looking through your mother's journal. I was asked to do a look like an erma bombeck. I had to rewrite it and rewrite it. I went through a bunch of things. It was my mom's wisdom that got me through a lot of it. I wrote it as her only daughter, growing up in the entertainment world. All those boys. All those boys. Eight brothers. And I have eight children. So I just wanted to do something to honor her. Think she was one of the greatest women that I knew. What is the one piece of wisdom you're most grateful for? One piece of wisdom? To love yourself. You know, think that that comes off as, selfish or whatever, but to really honor who you are as a person. The core values, the book is about various values that she taught me and our lives today are very different as mothers. My mother was a stay-at-home mother. She was always there for us. You were always working. I have always been a working mother. I have always had to support the family. So it's a different set of rules. It's like my mother always said, people may change, but truth done. There's a lot of wisdom in the things she taught me. Where you're a stay-at-home mom or a working mom, it's the wisdom from her. I went through journals. Just a remarkable woman. You're open about the pain. You have had the hardest blow any mother can have. Your son michael committed suicide about two years ago now. You write about how that day you knew something was wrong? You know, it's that intuition that all women have. I think in the business world that we live in, we forget to be still. And it's -- it's the hardest thing. I have lost my parents. I feel like, you know, I knew what it felt like to be an o orph orphan. To be the only girl, lose my mother, then my father. But to lose a child is never supposed thappen. What pulled me through, her wisdom and the information I put in there is -- I know from post partum depression. I wrote a book about that. You think everybody's life is better off without you in it. That is a lie. There is nothing better without the people you love in it. And you also talk about the lessons you learn from your daughter, jessica. The lesson about listening. She came out to you as a lesbian when she was 17. 17. You write about that and how other families have come to you and thanking you for teaching them to communicate about them. It's like the title of the book. Love is the key. I can't imagine I would want anything different for any of my children. I love her. She's a remarkable woman. She has the heart, bigger than the world and -- she's my kid. What can I say. And so I do believe in love. I believe in the principles of that and to honor each other. Would you like to see her marry snd. I would love to see her do what ever she wants. I know that she has been in some relationships. I don't think we should let anybody get married until e at least 23. That should be the law. But, no, you know, I desire everything for her that she wants in life. How could we not? It's being civil. It's the right thing to do. We all remember your final tour on "dancing with the stars." You made it right to the end. I got to the finals. Do you have a favorite? I have talk show on hallmark. I love it. We talk about all kinds of things opinion but, andy dick did the show. We did a cold opening. I said, you want to win that show, I have to teach you how to faint. I taught him how to pass out and keep his legs together. He's been surprising people. He's doing well. I have known him forever. I love him. We were talk about judgments. He has always owned it. No excuses. He's -- I told him, I said, you know, just hang in there. We all deserve and we all make mistakes. Thank you for coming back. It's a pleasure. T is called, "theey is love." You can see personal photos from the new book at goodmorningamerica.Com on yahoo!.

Reporter: Good... See More A shocking attempt to snatch a newborn. A woman tried to steal an infant from the maternity ward. But thanks to hospital security, the plot was foiled. Linsey davis is here with more. Reporter: Good morning, amy. Police say she was armed with a visitor's pass, when she made a beeline for the maternity ward. They say she thought a baby would get her husband back. Today, she is scheduled to be arraigned on kidnapping charges. Watch as 48-year-old grisel ramirez, in hospital scrubs, casually strolled into this california hospital. Moments later, police say she walked into the maternity ward at garden grove medical center, and right into the room with a mother and newborn baby. She walked in the room. Told the mother the doctor was on the way to see her. Wanted her to take a shower. Reporter: When the new mother went in to take a shower, police say ramirez put the infant in this purple tie-dye tote bag and took off. Somebody tried to walk out with a baby in a bag. Is it her baby? No. It's not her baby. Reporter: Ramirez never made it past the hospital door. She was locked in, all because of a little sensor like this, often placed on a baby's ankle or wrist, within an hour of birth. An alarm sounds, locks engage. Even elevators stop. Police say ramirez was stopped by employees who heard the alarm. Ramirez doesn't have a history of mental health. Just last week, she walked into another hospital and questioned a pregnant woman there. Causing police to circulate a flyer with her picture on it. She's separating from her husband. And she told her husband she was pregnant. So, at this time, she had to produce a baby girl. Reporter: The baby was returned to its mother unharmed. Meanwhile, police say ramirez, who has two adult children of her own, gave police several fake names. She's an undocumented immigrant and is being held without bail. This is every mother's nightmare. Thank goodness it turned out all right. Such good security in hospitals now. Now, we remember our friend, This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Famine Relief Progress Slow in Race to Save Millions

While the world's attention this week has been focused on the global economic impact of the U.S. debt ceiling deal, credit downgrade and subsequent market woes, the drought crisis in the Horn of Africa continues to deteriorate.
Children in are dying at an alarming rate.
The United States estimates that as many as 29,000 Somali children died just in the last 90 days.
Three more areas in Southern Somalia have been added to the famine zone and the UN warns that without urgent intervention all of Southern Somalia will be engulfed in famine, resulting in the likelihood of tens of thousands of Somalis literally starving to death.
There have also been hopeful developments.
The retreat of the Al Qaeda-backed group Al Shabab from Mogadishu means that aid groups will have an easier time reaching the more than 500,000 people living either near or inside the capital city suffering from famine.
It's also significant progress for the current weak central government being backed by African Union troops.
For four years the fiercest battles for the soul of the country have taken place in Mogadishu.
"We have been dreaming of this day for more than three years," Somalia's Prime Minister Prime Minister Dr. Abdiweli Mohamed Ali said in a statement."This is a big day, and a tremendous step forward, towards a more stable Somalia. By their actions in the past hours the extremists have shown that they never had a place in a peaceful Somalia...And the people do not want them here," he said.
Virtually no one believes the retreat will be permanent, a point punctuated by an Al Shabab spokesperson who called the pull-out a "tactical" decision and told reporters the group will continue to fight the government and AU troops using guerilla warfare.
"We shall fight the enemy wherever they are," Ali Mohamed Rage, reportedly told a local radio station. He also emphasized the militant group will be tightening its control in Southern Somalia, where Shabab rules unabated.
But even within the Islamist insurgency there remains a long-standing conflict within the leadership made up of mostly foreign Al Qaeda fighters, who want Shabab to play a bigger role in waging global jihad and Somali clan leaders who want to keep the movement Somalia-focused, defeating the current government and AU forces and impose strict sharia law.
The confusion over whether the militants will allow foreign aid agenciesto operate in areas they control has highlighted the rift, with some local clan leaders insisting that they won't let their people starve.
Some humanitarian organizations like UNICEF are already operating in Shabab-controlled areas, and more aid agencies are working on getting access to the most needy.
"We do not believe that Shabab is a monolithic -centrally controlled organization," Bruce Wharton, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs told reporters last week. "There are degrees of Shababness, so to speak."

Transcript: Alan Greenspan
Oct. 4, 2009 Page 6 of 17
CORNYN: Johnny Isakson -- Johnny Isakson of Georgia has been championing the -- the tax credit for home purchases. Now it's getting ready to expire, and it's limited to $8,000 for first-time purchasers. His argument is, and I think he's right, is that the housing inventories, or excess housing inventories are what are dampening the recovery.
And I think he's right. So that's something we are...
(CROSSTALK)
STEPHANOPOULOS: So we have agreement: extend unemployment benefits, extend health care benefits for people who are unemployed, and extend the housing tax credit.
SCHUMER: And let me just say one other thing here, broader-term. The stimulus is working. The American people see it. Forty percent has been spent. Before the stimulus, we were losing 700,000, 800,000 jobs a month, a huge amount. It's going down. The number now is about 300,000. And Alan Greenspan said, it should turn around soon.
So, before doing a second stimulus, let's see how the rest of the 60 percent works and try to deal with the pain of some people in terms of the job front, where John and I agree, and in certain targeted areas of the economy such as housing.
STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, then, let's get to health care, where I expect you're going to see some bigger differences right now. Probably the most contentious debate you all had all week long was on this amendment by Senator Crapo, where he was saying he wanted to put forward an amendment that would basically implement the president's policy not to have any tax increases for anyone earning under $250,000.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. MICHAEL D. CRAPO, R-IDAHO: It simply provides that no tax, no fee or penalty imposed by this legislation shall be applied to any individual earning less than $200,000 per year or any couple earning less than $250,000 per year.
STEPHANOPOULOS: All but one Democrat voted against that. Why?
SCHUMER: Well, because it's the way that "tax" was defined. They're defining "tax" -- you tax the insurance companies. They made huge amounts of profit. It went from $2 billion to $12 billion in 10 years.
STEPHANOPOULOS: He left that out of his amendment, I think.
SCHUMER: No, his amendment was so broad, it could include just about anything.
They're calling the requirement that people have to buy health insurance a tax.
Now, you may like it; you may not like it. But it's never been a tax. We don't -- we've never called the requirement that you have to have auto insurance a tax.
So if it were narrowly defined and said, really, a direct tax on people $250,000 or lower, I think that's going to be in the bill. We're trying to avoid that in every possible way. That's the president's promise and that's what the bill does.
CORNYN: Middle-class families are going to see higher health insurance premiums. They're going to see more taxes, more penalties under this bill.
The president can't keep his promise under the bill that's currently pending in the Finance Committee or any of the other bills that are currently in front of us.
One thing that we need to focus on is, you know, affordability is the single most important issue, bringing down the cost, bring the cost curve, making it more affordable so more people can get coverage.
