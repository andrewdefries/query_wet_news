Hannele Cox, 13, from Oak Hills, Calif., has battled a rare, flesh-eating infection she contracted from the tank when she was 8 and doctors have been unable to stop it from spreading. The bacteria has now spread to the bones of her right hand. "I can't use that hand at all. I'm in pain all the time," says Hannele.

Physical Inactivity as Damaging to Health as Smoking

A new series of studies published found that physical inactivity is a pandemic throughout the world. Getty Images

Physical inactivity has a negative global impact so severe that its adverse effects on health are comparable to that of smoking or obesity, according to a new study.
What's more, the researchers say the problem of inactivity is so bad that it should be considered a pandemic.
The study is just one in a special series of reports in the journal Lancet, timed -- in an ironic twist -- to coincide with the Olympics.
Specifically, the scientists found that inactivity was responsible for 5.3 million out of 57 million deaths throughout the world in 2008, and it caused around one in 10 deaths globally, which is comparable to the effects of smoking. The researchers also, for the first time ever, analyzed and quantified the global impact of physical inactivity on some of the world's most prominent diseases.
In the first article, researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School estimated that a failure to spend at least 150 minutes per week doing moderate physical activity, such as briskly walking for 30 minutes, contributed to an average of 6 percent to 10 percent of several diseases worldwide, including type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, colon cancer and coronary heart disease.
"Physical inactivity and obesity both have deleterious effects on [these] diseases," Dr. I-Min Lee, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study, told ABCNews.com. "Our findings described above examined the effects of inactivity, after taking into account the adverse effect of obesity. Thus, the results may be an underestimate of the true effect, since physical activity helps to control body weight."
If everyone did start participating in about the 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day, life expectancy throughout the world would increase by 0.68 years, Lee noted in the study.
Dr. George Flores, program manager for the California Endowment, weighed in on the series, and called it "timely" and "important."
Risk to health from inactivity is actually greater than the risk to health from being obese, he said.
"In the USA, the number of insufficiently active people is 50 percent greater than the number of obese people," said Flores. "That means that the opportunity to lessen risk for more people to a whole host of health problems is greater if we focus our attention on getting more people active instead of just focusing on obesity. Reducing inactivity is the single most promising opportunity to improve the health of the population at large."
Modern conveniences, including cars and computers, have contributed to the influx of physical inactivity in recent decades. Social isolation has also contributed to the shift to an inactive society.
Since the publication of the study "Actual Causes of Death in the United States," in 1993, Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale Prevention Center, said scientists have known that the three leading causes of premature death here are tobacco, poor diet and lack of physical activity.
Now, these data are becoming apparent throughout the modern world.
"Since 1993, tobacco exposure, here in the U.S., at least, has declined," said Katz. "So the relative contributions of feet and forks to the total burden of chronic disease and premature death has risen. And as labor-saving technologies proliferate across the globe, so, too, do the ill effects of sedentariness."
In the second study, Brazilian researchers showed that about one-third of adults throughout the world are at high risk of disease because of their lack of physical activity.
The researchers defined the recommended amounts of moderate activity as at least 30 minutes or more, five times per week, or vigorous activity for 20 minutes three times per week. They found that inactivity rises with age. It is more prevalent in high-income countries and is higher in women than men.
Of note, several low-income countries in Africa and the poorest regions of Latin America had inconclusive data to properly show inactivity rates for the study.
A third paper conducted by University of Tennessee researchers analyzed successful and promising interventions that can be used to work more physical activity into daily life.
"Because even moderate physical activity such as walking and cycling can have substantial health benefits, understanding strategies that can increase these behaviors in different regions and cultures has become a public health priority," Dr. Gregory Heath, lead author of the study, said in a statement.
After examining more 100 reviews of exercise interventions between 2001 and 2001, researchers found that the most successful ones included community exercise events and social support networks, such as buddy systems and walking clubs. Creating surrounding areas that are conducive to walking, biking and running encouraged people to get out and exercise more, and several studies showed that lighting and aesthetics of exercise areas can improve levels by up to 50 percent.
Whether technology or apps, running paths or lighted parks are available, Keith Ayoob, associate professor of pediatrics at Albert Einstein School of Medicine in New York said, it's important to "just move. Period."
"There's no substitute for low-tech moving, but there are apps and such that can motivate and help track," said Ayoob. "And we need to learn to decrease sedentary leisure activities. Sometimes you have to just power down to strengthen up."
With so many people throughout the world connected to mobile devices, there is indeed a place for apps. Researchers from the CDC found that text messages and other communications through mobile devices could successfully contribute to exercise interventions.
Finally, in a fifth paper, researchers said the prevalence of inactivity and its extreme effect on global health makes the problem a pandemic.
"The response to physical inactivity has been incomplete, unfocused, and most certainly understaffed and underfunded, particularly compared with other risk factors for non-communicable diseases," Dr. Harold W. Kohl, III of The University of Texas Health School of Public Health and lead author of the fifth paper, said in a statement.
Kohl and his colleagues noted in the study that exercise should be worked into a multifaceted system in society, through transportation, education, government, medical prevention and public health programs. Community-based efforts, rather than focusing on individual physicality, will be more beneficial in increasing exercise worldwide.
"The analysis here is convincing," said Katz of the Lancet series. "And common sense supports the conclusion reached by science: Failure to put our innate animal vitality through its native paces is taken life from our years, and years from our lives."

Longevity Linked to Education, Study Suggests
March 12, 2008 Page 2 of 2
Cutler, Meara and Seth Richards, a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, used two huge data banks to examine the role education plays in longevity, one covering 1981 to 1988, and another from 1990 to 2000. The cutoff for education was one year of college. They examined death statistics for African-Americans and white Americans, men and women, to see what life expectancy each person had at the age of 25.
Gains in lifespan grew by 30 percent during those periods for the "better educated," which the researchers attribute primarily to decreased smoking. Conversely, the

A Daughter Who Succeeded, a Son Who Found Trouble
April 18, 2007 By MARCUS BARAM By any measure, they were a quiet unassuming immigrant family living the American dream.
After moving to the United States from South Korea in 1992, Sung and Hyang Cho set up a dry cleaning business near Washington, D.C. The couple lived in a two-story cream-colored town house in the upper-middle-class Sully Station neighborhood of Centreville, Va. And their daughter, Sun-Kyung, who graduated from Princeton in 2004, moved back home while she worked as a State Department contractor.
But that dream was shattered after their son Seung-hui Cho's murderous Monday morning rampage at Virginia Tech University, where authorities believe he killed 32 students and professors before turning his gun on himself.
At the end of that tragic day, FBI agents and state police officers pulled up in six cars and searched the Cho home in Centreville for 90 minutes as officers moved in and out of the house taking pictures. By the time the media swarmed the house yesterday morning, the family was gone, escorted by the police to an undisclosed location. According to a South Korean Embassy official quoted in the Korean media, the couple was hospitalized for shock.
It was every parent's nightmare, magnified a hundred times -- to see a child descend into depression, commit murder and mayhem, and take his own life. For the Chos, it must have been all the more poignant, since their son's path diverged so widely from their daughter's journey.
By anyone's criteria, Sun-Kyung Cho is an accomplished young woman. At Princeton, where she majored in economics, she extended her learning by getting some real-world experience.
Motivated by an interest in observing actual labor conditions in a developing country, she got an internship at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok during the summer before her senior year. "They were the most amazing three months of my life," Cho told the Princeton Weekly Bulletin upon her return, describing how moving it was for her to see impoverished young Burmese girls making ceramics and garments in factories along the Thai-Burmese border.
She also wrote for the campus newspaper, The Daily Princetonian, contributing at least two articles, one of which was about sweatshop labor.
Cho currently works as a contractor at the State Department. A colleague in her office told ABCNEWS.com that Cho is taking an undefined leave of absence to cope with the tragedy.
Sung Cho, 61, and Hyang Cho, 56, kept a low profile in the small town, attending services at the Korean Presbyterian Church and planting lettuce in the backyard of their home.
They've come a long way from their days in poverty in a suburb of Seoul, according to their former landlord Lim Bong-ae. Back then, the couple lived in a rented basement apartment, which is usually the cheapest unit in an apartment building, he told a Korean newspaper.
The couple ran a used bookstore, Seung-hui's grandfather told another Korean newspaper. When relatives invited the family to the United States, he said they jumped at the chance to "provide better education for the children."
The unnamed grandfather was shocked at his family's connection to the massacre. "My grandson Seung-hui was very shy. I can't believe he did such a thing," he told the paper.
When Seung-hui was in first grade, attending Shinchang Elementary, the family moved, first settling in Detroit. They soon relocated to Virginia and eventually bought the three-bedroom house in Centreville for $145,000 in 1997.
The couple was very unassuming. They did not take part in many community activities, were not registered to vote, and most neighbors could hardly recall talking to them.
"They're very quiet, very nice people. ... They worked very hard for him. It's very sad," their next-door neighbor, Abdul Shash, told The Associated Press.
"They were hardworking," said Jeff Ahn, president of the League of Korean Americans in Virginia. "They valued education, just like any other parents in this country, and they worked sometimes 12, 13 hours a day to send a daughter to Princeton and to send their son to Virginia Tech."
