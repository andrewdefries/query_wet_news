Transcript for Stanley Tucci Has Fun Playing 'British Baddie'
We're back, now, with stanley tucci, starring in the brand-new movie "jack and the giant slayer." A surprising twist on a classic tale. So delighted to have you with us on this oscar celebratory day.... See More We're back, now, with stanley tucci, starring in the brand-new movie "jack and the giant slayer." A surprising twist on a classic tale. So delighted to have you with us on this oscar celebratory day. Yeah. As a nominee, this is an exciting week, I would imagine. It is. It is. It's very exciting. Not for me because I wasn't nominated this year. But thanks for bringing it up. "Lovely bones," everybody. My favorite movie of all-time. In these last few days, what's it like for the nominees? It's thrilling. You know, the hollywood award season kind of goes on forever. It's really tiring. But it's really -- it's actually really, really fun. It's really fun. I want to talk to you about "jack and the giant slayer." This is a modern take on the classic tale. For one, there's more than one giant. Many giants. Big, incredibly-designed giants. And big, you are not. But you're a bad, bad guy. You play roderick. I want to show everybody a clip. I believe in this, you're trying to rescue the princess from the giants. But you have a bit of an agenda. I have an agenda. Well put. Let's take a look. Well done, roderick. Have them released at once. I'm talking to giants now. By the way, darling, the wedding's off. So, visitors, I bring you the gift of freedom. Tonight, we feast. But tomorrow, we shall return below, with me as your new king. Josh sort of sounded like you. You have said about the role -- I always look to him for -- well, you guys, I know you study together. Creative inspiration. The character roderick, in this film, you said, if you are not booing roderick, I have not done this job. How much fun was it to play this bad guy? It was great fun. I got to wear a wig, which is always fun. Fake teeth. Always fun. And a cheap british accent. It was great. Good times had by all. You are also coming up on two other huge films. "The hunger games," the next installment. And also, "the percy jackson series." That's right. I only do big movies now. That's it. We understand. We, tos actors, only do big movies. And we're so taken by your performance in "the hunger games," we want you to see our version. A very important scene. Really? Yeah. We have some "b" roll of this. Jimmy kimmel is playing you in there. Oh, my gosh. There's josh, again. On fire. I'm actually hot. I don't know how to respond to that. That's amazing. Can I have a copy of it? Yes. We will. "Jack and the giant slayer" let's get back to this. My kids will love you. What draws you to the bad guys? If they're well-written, it's really, really fun to do. And the thing is, he has a sense of humor, a very dry wit. And that's attractive to play. And I never played the british baddy before. This goes back to the films with errol flynn and bazle wrathbone playing the sheriff. It's very funny. And you kind of the show. Oh. Thank you very much. That's me saying that. I always like to. Thank you. Everybody, we thank you, stanley, for being with us on our tribute to all things oscar. Please do check out "jack the giant slayer." IT OPENS NEXT FRIDAY, MARCH 1st. And we will see you soon. Come back in costume. I will. This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

MANJI: Well, I would suggest that the right thing is to build a mosque near ground zero, but use it as an opportunity to make it the most tolerant, the most transparent and the modern Islam that the world has ever seen.
AMANPOUR: Eboo, you've done a lot in interfaith dialogue, trying to really build bridges here since the disaster of 9/11. What does this say to you, this fervor that is being whipped up, this rising tide of anti-Islamic sentiment in this country? Because let me just read you, actually, some of the poll numbers, which are -- which are interesting here. Mainstream Islam encourages violence against non-Muslims. That was a question by ABC News, and 31 percent of the respondents said yes.
The next question, do you have a good basic understanding of the teachings and beliefs of Islam? 55 percent of the respondents said no. So what has all your work done over the last nine years?
PATEL: Christiane, I have to tell you, the story of this last week is the story of the bridge builders in America coming out. When the faces of intolerance show themselves, the forces of inclusiveness in America go into action. On Friday afternoon, when I came back to my office after Eid prayers and a set of interviews, there was a sixth-grade girl at the interfaith youth corps who said, I heard about this planned Koran burning in Florida, and it hurt me in my heart. I think religions should be nice to each other. I'm donating my allowance to your organization.
AMANPOUR: Well, that's wonderful, but you yourself have said that you feel even more scared now as a Muslim, and many people have said, than you did at 9/11.
PATEL: Well, you know, Christiane, that's true. My mother called me yesterday and she said, Eboo, I've been in this country for 35 years as a Muslim, and I have never been scared to say I was fasting, I've never been scared to say that I call god Allah, but I'm scared now and I'm scared for your kids, Eboo. I'm scared that their names might be too Muslim, that they might get bullied in school.
And what I tell her, is, mom, you know, this is a blip in the broader arc of inclusiveness that is America. And the history books will read, as they have read before, that the forces of inclusiveness will defeat the forces of intolerance.
MANJI: Only, though, if we also acknowledge, Eboo -- and I know you're the kind of guy who would acknowledge this -- that there are plenty of people who are not Muslim in this country who have legitimate fears of their own, who are worried and anxious about, you know, what Islam means for this country.
And one of the reasons that they do have those anxieties is over the last nine years, moderate Muslims have failed -- moderate Muslims have failed -- to make the case for why there is nothing to fear about Islam. When Major Nidal Hasan opens fire on a group of fellow soldier at Fort Hood, Texas, shouting "Allahu akbar," God is great, and the first thing you hear out of the mouth of a moderate is, please don't misunderstand, Islam has nothing to do with this -- you can't blame ordinary Americans for scratching their heads and wondering, well, what role does religion play here?
