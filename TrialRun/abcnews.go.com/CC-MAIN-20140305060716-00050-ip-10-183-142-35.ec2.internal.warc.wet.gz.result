Scorpion Anti-Venom Speeds Children's Recovery
May 14
By Kevin McKeever WEDNESDAY, May 13 (HealthDay News) -- An anti-venom medication used in Mexico but not approved for use in the United States appears able to quickly and completely help children recover from the nerve poisoning caused by the bark scorpion's sting, a new study finds. It typically took less than two hours for the irregular eye movements, involuntary thrashing of limbs, breathing difficulties and other symptoms to disappear in all eight children in the study who were given the drug after suffering a bite from a bark scorpion, according to the research lead by University of Arizona researchers.
Seven children who were also stung but given a placebo continued to have symptoms for more than four hours and needed heavy sedation and hospitalization to fully recover, the researchers say. The children in the study, published in the May 14 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, had all been brought into a Tucson, Ariz., pediatric intensive care unit for treatment following the sting. Most of the sting victims were under the age of 6. "This study told us that the dangerous effects of bark scorpion venom can be reversed quickly with the right anti-venom," Dr. Leslie Boyer, principal investigator of the study and director of the Venom Immunochemistry, Pharmacology and Emergency Response Institute at The University of Arizona College of Medicine, said in a news release issued by the university. "One-hundred percent of the children who received it got better very quickly, meaning that using this anti-venom in the emergency room will make intensive care treatment unnecessary for most patients." The anti-venom, while commercially available in Mexico, is considered an experimental drug in the United States and has not received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Boyer said making the drug available in areas with scorpions, especially small towns, could save lives and save money on treatments. "What was a life-threatening disease that would put kids in the pediatric ICU has become, for most of them, an outpatient disease," study team member Dr. Andreas Theodorou, a professor of pediatrics and chief medical officer of University Medical Center in Tucson, said in the news release.

Buzzed Driving Is Drunken Driving
Dec. 28, 2005 By LAURA MARQUEZ The holiday season brings the deadliest drunken drivers to our nation's highways.
If the trend continues, nearly half of the fatal crashes that happen during the Christmas and New Year's holidays will involve at least one impaired driver. "Impaired" means anyone with a blood alcohol level above 0.08. Throughout the rest of the year, only 30 percent of highway fatalities include impaired drivers.
In an effort to make our roads safer, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, did some investigating and found that young men between the ages of 18 and 34 were responsible for the vast majority of drunk-driving accidents. But when asked, these young men made a distinction between being drunk and being buzzed.

Pilot in Buffalo Crash Had Failed Five Flight Tests
May 11, 2009

Investigators' latest findings on February's plane crash in Buffalo, N.Y., raise questions about whether the pilot's competency and training may have played a part in the accident.
The National Transportation Safety Board will begin a three-day hearing Tuesday to learn more about the crash that killed all 49 people on board the plane and one person on the ground.
In piecing together what went wrong, it's now apparent that the man at the controls of the Colgan Air commuter flight had failed five flight tests during his career, although the airline defended the pilot and and its training.
But Colgan Air confirmed today that Captain Marvin Renslow failed two tests of his flying skills and judgment while employed by the airline. His other three failing grades came when Renslow worked to become a licensed pilot.
Pilots fail flight tests from time to time, but some safety experts say a pattern of a particular kind of failure would raise a red flag.
Safety experts wonder whether the concerns raised in the crash investigation are unique to Colgan Air or symptoms of a broader problem with the regional airlines that millions of American fly.
Meantime, Colgan Air said it did not know about all the earlier failures when it hired Renslow. Still, the airline defended the pilot today, citing his qualifications and hours in the air. The airline said he was "fully qualified" to fly, having passed "six consecutive check rides" in the months prior to the accident.
"At the time of this accident, Captain Renslow was fully qualified in the Q400 and held an Airline Transport Pilot Type Certificate for that aircraft, the highest level of certification the FAA offers on any aircraft," the airline said in a statement.
Colgan added that Renslow's last unsatisfactory flight test occurred 16 months before the crash.
There are also questions tonight about training.
The crew allowed the plane to fly dangerously slow just before the accident. After a stall warning sounded, the pilot's control column, essentially the device used to steer the plane, moved sharply backward, pitching the nose of the turboprop upward. That was the wrong reaction.
Colgan Air Defends Its Training Practices
Colgan Air defended its training, which it says is approved by the FAA.
"All pilots are taught how to recover from a stall in the earliest stages of their private-pilot training," Colgan's statement said. "The technique in the Q400 is not substantively different from any other aircraft."
Aviation safety expert Michael Barr said the pilots had "had academic training, but not simulator training" for this particular kind of situation.
"I think it's absolutely necessary that you have simulator training in that type of emergency," said Barr, who is with the University of Southern California's aviation safety program. "You can't expect the pilot to react in a very, very emergency situation if he hasn't had actual hands-on training in a simulator."
Sources also told ABC News today that the crew violated cockpit rules with "irrelevant chatter" below 10,000 feet. At that altitude, the FAA requires pilots to focus only on the business of flying the plane.
Crash Investigators Examine the Fatigue Factor
Sources also said today that fatigue among crew members may have played a part.
