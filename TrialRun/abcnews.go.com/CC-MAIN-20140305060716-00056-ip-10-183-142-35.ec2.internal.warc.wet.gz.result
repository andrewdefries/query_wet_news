Ask an Expert: Stimulus plan has plenty for small business
February 9, 2009
Q: Is there anything in this massive federal economic stimulus plan for small business? — Rick
A:Yes, lots.
First a little history: While FDR's New Deal helped soften the worst blows of the Great Depression, the fact is that the Depression did not end until World War II began, due to the massive amount of spending and building that the country undertook to wage and win the war. That spending kick started the economy and finally ended the last vestiges of the long economic downturn.
That is the idea behind the current American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan, although obviously on a smaller scale. The plan is that, as different businesses get government contracts, they will begin to spend that money, and that in turn will create what is known as a "multiplier effect." As these companies get more money, they will in turn buy more from suppliers, and will also increase spending in other ways, including hiring employees to do the work, and so on. (Note: I am making no judgment call here as to the political and economic debate over whether spending or tax cuts are better. I am simply analyzing the opportunity here as is.)
Whatever the final number turns out to be — a trillion dollars or so — the fact is, there is going to be a lot of federal, state and local money available, and it behooves the smart small business owner to get him or herself ready to take advantage of it. That means learning about government contracting, and getting whatever paperwork and certificates you need in order now, so that when the spigot opens, you are ready to bid on your share.
It's not just the Haliburtons of the world who will be getting these contracts.
And, by the same token, don't think it's just construction businesses who will be able to take advantage of this unique opportunity; many small businesses can get their share; just look below.
But as long as we are on the subject, let's begin with construction. Small business related to the construction industry will be able to bid and get contracts for projects that are "shovel-ready." Here is a sample of some of the projects and the money that will eventually be involved (give or take a few billion):
• $16 billion for construction and renovation of schools• $2.4 billion for "family friendly" military construction projects — family housing, childcare facilities, etc. • $500 million to secure dams, bridges, and tunnels• $4.6 billion for water and hydro power projects
But, like I said, it's not just construction businesses that can partake at the government trough; consider:—
High Tech
• $9 billion to increase access to broadband, especially in rural communities• $ 5 billion to computerize health records
Transportation
• $8.4 billion for investments in public transportation• $160 million for investments in maritime transportation• $160 million for investments in maritime transportation• $160 million for investments in maritime transportation• $160 million for investments in maritime transportation• $1.3 billion for investments in air transportation• $1.1 billion for investments in rail transportation• $160 million for investments in maritime transportation• $830 million for repair and restoration of roads on park, forest, tribal, and other public lands
Housing
• $2 billion for redevelopment of foreclosed homes • $2 billion for affordable housing Green Technology

Tips on Landing Your Perfect Second Job Aug. 11, 2008 By TORY JOHNSON via To make ends meet in a challenging economy, more and more Americans are working two jobs or taking on part-time work as full-time positions are harder to land.
Focus on time. When you take on a second job, you have to maximize every minute, which means making as much money as possible in the limited time available. Figure out how much time you can realistically devote to a side job.
For example, if you have an hour a night, you can't do retail because stores don't hire for such a limited commitment. But if you're available all weekend, you might be perfect for a busy shop that needs extra help.
Beyond that, an hour a day as a part-time sales associate might pay $10 an hour. Or you could spend that same hour per day as a dog walker. A dog walker making $15 an hour per pet, with three simultaneous clients, is now making $45 an hour. In five days, one hour in retail might bring in $50, but the same hour during the same five day period for the dog walker brings in $225.
nullnull
As you pursue ideas, consider the various ways people are maximizing their time and take-home pay.
Fill an existing need. Click here for a list of Web sites that can connect you to part-time or hourly jobs. There are also sites that allow you to make money from home performing a variety of tasks. Last week, during a "GMA" segment on my new book, "Will Work From Home: Earn the Cash Without the Commute," I revealed some of my favorite Web sites. Several of those sites, which you can find by clicking here, saw record traffic from people eager to make money from home. I've also heard from many viewers who were able to get started within 24 hours and are now on their path to making money on their on terms -- for both full-time and supplemental incomes -- from home.
Extend your day job skills. Take your day job and apply it to private clients on your off time: A teacher can tutor, an accountant can do taxes, and so on. Just recently, the cable tech came to fix my service, and let it drop that he helps people set up their computer systems on the side. Get in the habit of talking up your side gig. The teacher probably can't tutor her own students, but she and her peers can refer families to one another.
Turn a hobby into cash. A photographer who doesn't make enough money shooting full-time can moonlight for parties and portraits on the weekend to bring in extra cash. Someone who makes beaded jewelry for fun can sell online. If you're active and athletic, give tennis or yoga lessons to private clients. Baby-sit if you enjoy spending time with kids. (For resources to get started in these areas, click here.)
Learn a new business. You can also use a second job, not only to earn the money you need, but to dip your toe in a new career. For example, an administrative assistant came to me with a two-fold challenge: a desire to boost her income, and a frustration with the process of switching fields. Her goal is to move into event planning, but without experience in that new line of work, her resume is usually dismissed. My suggestion: Take a temp job on weekends at a popular catering hall, assisting with large private and corporate functions to build experience in that field.
