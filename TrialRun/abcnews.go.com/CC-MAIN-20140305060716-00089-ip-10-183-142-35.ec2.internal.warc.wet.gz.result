New Weight Loss Surgery Removes Stomach Via Mouth
Aug. 18, 2010
By COURTNEY HUTCHISON, ABC News Medical Unit In the early morning of August 3rd, surgeons at the University of California, San Diego Medical Center removed 80 percent of Connie Harris' stomach -- through her mouth.
It may sound like a form of medieval torture, but this method -- Harris is the first person to undergo the procedure -- is a new way to potentially diminish the pain and risk associated with gastric sleeve weight loss surgery.
"The goal was to have a less painful recovery and less trauma to the abdomen," said Dr. Santiago Horgan, chief of minimally invasive surgery at UCSD Medical Center, who performed the surgery on Harris.
Through-the-throat removal of Harris' excess stomach allowed Horgan to avoid cutting through her abdominal muscles, he said, because he did not have to make an incision large enough to accommodate the removal of the stomach.
Harris, 60, of Carlsbad, Cal., was expecting her fourth grandchild just two weeks after her surgery date and opted for this novel approach with hopes of a speedier post-op recovery .
Now two weeks into her recovery, Harris said, "It's been a good recovery so far. I was off pain medication within a couple days of the surgery. I'm going to the park with my grandkids this morning."
Horgan's procedure isn't such a far cry from standard laparoscopic gastric sleeve surgery. It only modifies how the excess stomach is removed from the body. This small change, however, offers an even less invasive approach that doctors say brings bariatric surgery one step closer to an incision-free weight loss surgery.
Towards Incision-Free Weight Loss Surgery Horgan's procedure combines two well-established technologies -- gastric sleeve surgery and natural orifice surgery -- in a new way.
The vast majority of gastric sleeve surgery today is performed laparoscopically, via a series of small incisions in the abdomen. Tools, including a camera, are inserted through the incisions, and the stomach is stapled shut, reducing it to about one fifth of its original size. Springing a Stomach Leak?
The excess stomach must then be removed by widening one of these incisions to accommodate it, said Dr. Scott Belsley, director of robotic surgery at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital.
This larger incision puts patients at a slightly increased risk of hernia and wound infection and can cause more pain during recovery, noted Dr. Cori McBride, director of bariatric surgery at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
Using an endoscope with a snare, Horgan instead removed Harris' stomach through the esophagus and out through her mouth.
This approach, called natural orifice surgery, has been used in the past on other organs, or through other orifices, such as the vagina or anus, but to the best of Hogan's knowledge, this combination of gastric surgery and oral removal had not been tried.
"It's a clever idea and a clever application of the natural orifice surgery, one that moves us closer to developing a truly incision-less operation for weight loss," said Belsley.
The procedure is so new however, that potential risks of this approach have yet to be identified, McBride and Belsley noted, so it's unlikely that bariatric surgeons will immediately start using this technique.

The date is set for Samsung's next big reveal.
Mark your calendars! #UNPACKED pic.twitter.com/Pqc3gV7Y43— Samsung Mobile (@SamsungMobile) February 4, 2014 On Feb. 24, the company is set to show off its newest products at the Mobile World Congress, held in Barcelona, Spain. Though the invitations to "Unpacked" don't explicitly say what's in store, the prominence of the number five seems to say that they're ready to show off what's in store for their next smartphone, the Galaxy S5.
While Samsung has remained tight-lipped about what customers can expect from the new phones, some details have leaked out. A note from KDB Daewoo Securities, a top-level investment firm based in South Korea, goes into some of the technical specs of what the new phone could do, as well as some of its features.
Samsung Galaxy S4 Review: An Android Phone Commitment You Won't Regret
According to the note, the phone's screen will be getting a little bigger and crisper compared to the S4's specs, jumping up to 5.2-inches and 560 pixels per inch. The cameras are also expected to get an upgrade, with a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera and 3-megapixel front-facing camera.
In terms of new hardware, the Galaxy S5 may be expanding on the security features that the iPhone 5s used, including both a fingerprint sensor and an iris scanning sensor. In addition, the note mentions that the S5 will have a fully metallic body, as opposed to the plastic chassis in the Galaxy S4.
Samsung did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.
Ben Bajarin, principal analyst at Creative Strategies, said that the new phone faces challenges ahead, though the challenges have more to do with the market than problems at Samsung. "The premium smartphone market has just reached saturation," he told ABC News. "It'll be interesting to see how it all shakes out."

'This Week' Transcript: Axelrod
July 11, 2010 Page 7 of 17
BREWER: They're coming across our border illegally, and the majority of them, in my opinion -- and I think in the opinion of law enforcement -- is that they're not coming here to work. They're coming here and they're bringing drugs, and they're doing drop houses, and they're extorting people, and they're terrorizing the families. That is the truth, Matt. That is the truth.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TAPPER: Congressman Bilbray, that's not the truth. And I've never heard you make any comment along those lines. A majority of the individuals crossing the border are criminals and seeking criminal enterprise? Should that rhetoric be condemned?
BILBRAY: The majority is not -- they are not actively engaged in the drug traffic. The difference is the perception of those of us on the border, like myself who grew up down there, and somebody who's up -- up in the northern areas like Chicago see this differently.
She is seeing this, the fact that she's seeing the crime, she's seeing that her community is becoming the kidnap capital of the world. She's seeing the drugs tied to...
TAPPER: That's not necessarily true, either, by the way.
BILBRAY: Well, Tucson is supposed to be -- I mean, not in the world, but (inaudible) United States, a major issue here. But the fact is, anywhere in the United States, this place has gone out of control. We saw it in San Diego, and the same people that are opposing Arizona's actions are the same ones who said in San Diego our fences wouldn't work.
I think her perception is this. You cannot separate the drug cartels from the smuggling cartels. They're the same. You cannot separate the fact that the border region is out of control because there's all this illegal activity.
The problem is that Arizona took a leadership role two years ago when the United States didn't follow, and that is go to the real source. Watch out when they say secure the border, because the border is a symptom. The real problem is out-of-control illegal immigration getting to illegal jobs that are going all the way up to Chicago. But we're looking at the border.
You really want to secure the border? Secure the workplace in the United States. Have more ICE agents breaking down the -- the barriers to enforcement that we need to be breaking down the employment opportunities in places like Chicago. Then we'll be able to secure the borders.
TAPPER: Do you agree? Do you disagree?
GUTIERREZ: Here's the problem, and here's the fact that Mr. Bilbray leaves out of this debate. The fact is that 40 percent of the undocumented workers in this country didn't cross that border. They came here legally to the United States. They came on a tourist visa. They came on a student visa. They came on a temporary worker visa, and they overstayed their visa.
So what we do is we continue to focus on the border as if though that were the exclusive problem that we have with our immigration system and those staying here.
Look -- and we're in Washington, D.C. There are going to be tourists here this summer that aren't going back to their country, OK? There are going to be students that are going to graduate that aren't going back.
