'Fraiser' Star Kelsey Grammer Falls In Behind Mitt Romney
By AMY BINGHAM
Aug. 21, 2012
Jefferygarland.com/Boss © MMXI Lions Gate Television Inc.
Eight months ago "Fraiser" star Kelsey Grammer had his doubts about Mitt Romney, unenthusiastically telling ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel that the GOP candidate would "probably do a pretty good job."
Those doubts have dissipated now that Romney is set to become the Republican nominee. Grammer told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this week that Romney would "make a terrific president."
"I think he'd be very good at it," Grammer said in the interview that was published Monday. "He's a clear thinker. He's a kind man, you know, and he makes a lot of sense."
In January, Grammer was on the fence about whether to support Romney or Romney's GOP rival Rick Santorum. The actor, who now plays a fictitious Chicago mayor in the Starz show "Boss," campaigned for Republican presidential candidate John McCain in 2008.
While Grammer's support goes in the Romney column, the presumptive Republican candidate still trails Obama in his celebrity support. Here is a look at the stars who are aligning behind Romney, and the constellations forming to support Obama.
Barack ObamaMichael Tran/FilmMagicGwen Stefani
There was face painting, animal balloons and fake tattoos on the tennis courts, and big white umbrellas on the lawn of Gwen Stefani's Beverly Hills house Sunday as she played host to Michelle Obama for a family-friendly Sunday of Fun. The No Doubt rocker and her two sons, 6-year-old Kingston and 3-year-old Zuma, frolicked with the first lady at the $2,500-per-family fundraiser, which Stefani called a "playdate."
"Getting ready for Michelle Obama to come for a playdate," Stefani tweeted before the event, adding later that "Zuma cried all over my pink top! Oh well mom central."
While President Obama has been racking up Hollywood endorsers, the first lady has attracted support of her own from an array of female singers, like Stefani and Beyonce.Barack ObamaMike Coppola/Getty Images for MartiniElizabeth Banks
"Hunger Games" actress Elizabeth Banks may not want to talk to her employer about her intimate women's health issues, but she candidly lays them out for President Obama supporters in the president's latest campaign ad.
Banks, who most recently played Effie Trinket in "The Hunger Games," admits she got birth control from Planned Parenthood as an uninsured recent college graduate "for my massive migraine headaches and my heavy flow."
"These aren't the types of things I want to discuss with employers," Banks said, weighing in on the debate between Republicans and Democrats over Planned Parenthood funding. "That's between me and my doctor and at the time my doctor happened to be at Planned Parenthood. So I'm really grateful they exist."
Banks said she is supporting Obama because he has "not compromised on women's rights," while his GOP rival Mitt Romney wants to cut funding to Planned Parenthood over the small percentage of the health care provider's business that goes to providing abortions.
"For that little 5 percent that Mitt Romney decides he doesn't agree with he's going to take away cancer screenings? What is he doing?" Banks says in the ad. "He's going to take away people's access to health care close by."Barack ObamaRon Phillips/Warner Bros. PicturesAnne Hathaway
Days after "The Dark Night Rises" hauled in $36 million at the box offices last weekend, its fierce female star, Anne Hathaway, helped President Obama rake in millions for his re-election campaign at a Hollywood-studded fundraiser in Connecticut.
Hathaway co-hosted the $35,800 per-person fundraiser Monday night with producer Harvey Weinstein at his home in Connecticut. The duo helped Obama add $2 million to his campaign war chest.
Hathaway is a longtime Obama supporter, having attended his inauguration festivities in 2009 and telling People magazine shortly after his election that she'd love to work in the White House as "First Babysitter" for Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia.
The president returned the compliment at Monday's fundraiser, gushing about Hathaway's "spectacular" performance as Catwoman in the latest Batman movie.
"She's spectacular," Obama told the crowd of about 60 supporters. "I got a chance to see 'Batman,' and she was the best thing in it.
"That's just my personal opinion," the president added as Hathaway beamed and laughed, according to the pool press report.
Other notable names at the fashionable fundraiser included "West Wing" screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, Vogue editor Anna Wintour and reality-TV host Jerry Springer.Mitt RomneyCliff Owen/AP PhotoClint Eastwood
On August 3, Clint Eastwood came out in support of Mitt Romney when he made an appearance at an Idaho fundraiser for the presumptive GOP nominee.
The Oscar-winning director said he is supporting Romney this November "because I think the country needs a boost somewhere."
While Eastwood also endorsed Republican in 2008, lending his support to Sen. John McCain in his bid for the White House and even campaigning for him, his position the 2012 race hasn't always been clear. After a cameo in a Super Bowl ad about the revival of the auto industry this February, where he uttered the instantly famous line, "It's halftime, America," Eastwood was forced to clarify that he was not in fact supporting Obama's re-election campaign.Mitt RomneyAngela Weiss/Getty ImagesJenna Jameson
Sipping champagne in the VIP lounge of San Francisco's Gold Club gentleman's lounge, former porn star Jenna Jameson said she was supporting Mitt Romney to win the White House in November.
"I'm very looking forward to a Republican being back in office," Jameson told a CBS San Francisco staffer in August. "When you're rich, you want a Republican in office."
But four years ago Jameson, who is estimated to have a net worth of $20 million, was singing the opposite tune.
"I look forward to another Democrat being in office," Jameson told PR.com, noting that Republicans "put their crosshairs on the adult industry."
Jameson said in the 2007 interview that she supported then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
"I love Hillary," Jameson said. "I think that in some ways she's pretty conservative for a Democrat, but I would love to have a woman in office."Barack ObamaJay LaPrete/Getty ImagesJerry Springer
Talk show host Jerry Springer, a lifelong Democrat, does not see why America would not want President Obama in the White House for another four years. The reality TV presenter lavished praise on the president after meeting with him in Cincinnati in July.
"I have met with lots of politicians, but this man is truly exceptional," Springer said after the meeting, according to the Huffington Post. "He's so competent and so smart, I just don't see why we wouldn't want him for four more years as president."
Springer was once a politician himself, serving one year as mayor of Cincinnati and running failed campaigns for Congress and Ohio governor.
"I'm a long-standing supporter of the Democratic Party and believe in President Obama," Springer said.Barack ObamaJim Spellman/WireImage/Getty ImagesMorgan Freeman
Morgan Freeman, actor and vocal Obama supporter, became the second celebrity donor to write a $1 million check to the support the president's re-election bid. Since there is a spending cap on individuals contributing to political candidates, Freeman gave his million to the pro-Obama Super PAC Priorities USA Action.
"Pres. Obama has done a remarkable job in historically difficult circumstances," Freeman said.
The actor praised obama for ending combat operations in Iraq, reforming Wall Street, keeping the auto industry alive, reforming health care and appointing the first woman to the Supreme Court.
"He has led our nation to be more tolerant," Freman said. "In return, he is the target of hundreds of millions of dollars from right-wing sources. I am proud to lend my voice - and support - to those who defend him. Priorities USA Action is doing a great job of protecting the values I believe in. I am happy to help them and I hope others will join me."Barack ObamaGustavo Caballero/Getty ImagesBill Nye the Science Guy
Bill Nye, that quirky science guy from 1990s TV fame, took his brightly-colored bow ties on the campaign trail making a trip through New Hampshire in support of the Obama campaign on July 16. At stops in three New Hampshire towns, Nye sang the praises of the president's education policies and pushed for more science and engineering programs.
"This is the most important election of my life and I believe we're at a crossroads, a turning point," Nye told the Fosters Daily Democrat. "We can either move forward, especially in education, or backward. I think voters have a clear choice, so I'm supporting the president."
The eccentric Science Guy who showed children the fun side of learning on his 'Science Guy' TV show appeared as a special guest at both of the White House Science Fairs.
"The choice is clear" on who to vote for in November Nye proclaimed at the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord, N.H. "The president supports moving education forward, supporting our teachers and administrators and public education, and the other side, for lack of a better expression, just wants to take it for granted."Barack ObamaJerod Harris/Getty Images for KohlsMarc Anthony
President Obama has added another star-studded fundraiser to his already history-breaking list, appearing with singer Marc Anthony in Miami Beach in June.
The concert featuring the Latino singer in the heavily-Hispanic state of Florida came just one day after the Supreme Court struck down three key parts of Arizona's immigration law – a win for Obama – and upheld the state's right to check the immigration status of everyone stopped by police – a win for Republican Gov. Jan Brewer.
Anthony, who supported Obama in 2008, aimed to convince Latinos to support the president in a campaign video released in early June.
"The president has our back, so it's time to let him know that we've got his," Anthony says in the video.Mitt RomneyBrendan Smialowski/Getty ImagesBob Dole
While former presidential candidate Bob Dole is not your typical Hollywood celebrity, as a 40-year veteran of the Republican Party leadership his endorsement still packs a punch.
Dole, you could say, endorsed Mitt Romney before endorsing Mitt Romney was cool, writing a letter supporting the former Massachusetts governor that ran in the Des Moines Register in the midst of the rough and tumble of the GOP primary in December.
Dole described that early endorsement this week in an interview with GQ, saying his support came down to a choice between Romney and former GOP candidate Newt Gingrich.
"I'm not a Gingrich fan, so…" Dole said, "I thought he—well, I'll say this: Romney looks like a president."
Dole insisted his Romney endorsement was "not tepid at all," noting that Romney's opponent President Obama is "totally out of step."Barack ObamaKiko Ricote/National Latino Broadcasting, LLC/PRNewsFotoCristina Saralegui
Days after President Obama announced that his administration would no longer deport young undocumented immigrants, the woman often dubbed the "Hispanic Oprah" made her first-ever presidential endorsement, pledging her support for Obama.
Cristina Saralegui, who has hosted a popular Univision talk show for more than 20 years, is featured in two Obama for America campaign videos, one in English and one in Spanish.
"I came to this country when I was 12 years old because my parents wanted to give me new opportunities to succeed," Saralegui says in the video. "President Obama wants everyone to have the chances I had."
Saralegui's support comes as both Obama and Romney are making a push to court Hispanic voters, one of the fastest-growing voting blocs. If endorsements from Latino celebrities are any guide, Obama has a head start over Romney, with Saralegui joining the likes of Marc Anthony, Eva Longoria and Ricky Martin on the president's side.Endorsed: Barack ObamaDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Steve & Marjorie Harvey FoundationSpike Lee
Director Spike Lee, an ardent Obama supporter in 2008, is less optimistic about the president's election prospects this time around, telling GQ magazine in an article published June 12 that an Obama win in November "is not a lock."
"The people have to get out and vote," Lee said. "It is not a lock that President Obama is getting a second term, and people have to really rekindle the enthusiasm that we had the first time."
As for Mitt Romney, Lee said the best thing he has going for him is that "he's not Obama."
"Once we get to the debates my man [Obama] is going to tear him up," Lee said. "It's going to be obvious who should lead this country for the next four years once they go head to head, toe to toe, elbow to elbow, butt to butt. And I don't think Mr. Romney can hang with him. He just can't!"
Lee and his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, hosted the president at their New York City brownstone home for a $35,800-per-ticket fundraiser in January.
During his remarks to the crowd of about 40 supporters, Obama told the movie producer/director that on his "first official date" with Michelle Obama, he took her to see "Do the Right Thing," which Lee wrote and directed in 1989.
"I think you helped me out that day," Obama said. "So it worked out, which is why I've always had a soft spot for Spike Lee in my heart."Endorsed: Barack ObamaKevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty ImagesJay-Z
If there's any lingering doubt about whether rapper Jay-Z is an Obama supporter, as he was in 2008, the hip-hop megastar dispelled it in June.
In an interview with CNN, Jay-Z said President Obama is a better choice for the country than Mitt Romney "by leaps and bounds."
The rapper praised Obama's recent support for same-sex marriage, saying the issue "is still holding the country back."
"You can chose to love whoever you love; that's your business," Jay-Z, 42, said. "It's no different than discrimination against blacks. It's discrimination plain and simple."
Jay-Z and wife Beyonce have been ardent Obama supporters since his 2008 campaign. And the president is equally supportive of the hip-hop duo. When The Atlantic asked whether he preferred Jay-Z or Kanye West, Obama said, without hesitation, "Jay-Z."
Beyonce showed her love for the first family in January, writing a letter to Michelle Obama in which she said the first lady was "the ULTIMATE example of a truly strong African American woman."Endorsed: Barack ObamaRay Tamarra/Getty ImagesRicky Martin
International pop star Ricky Martin, famous for hits like "Livin' La Vida Loca," swung his infamously leather pants clad hips in step behind President Obama, endorsing him for the 2012 election.
The openly gay singer hosted a fundraiser with Obama in New York just days after the president publicly declared his support for same-sex marriage in May.
"I applaud President @barackobama for affirming that ALL Americans should enjoy equal rights," Martin tweeted shortly after the president's announcement. "Historic! I will be a very proud host on Monday."
While the fundraiser was scheduled weeks before Obama's announcement, it takes on a new significance following Obama's assertion that "same sex couples should be able to get married."
"I am proud to support our president," Martin told Univision's Spanish-language program Primer Imapcto after announcing the fundraiser in April.
"I believe Barack Obama has shown a deep conviction to help those most in need, even if their voices are not always the ones heard the loudest in Washington," Martin continued. "He has also been an exceptionally strong advocate for the Latino and LGBT communities, leading us to precedent setting milestones such as the appointment of the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice and the repeal of [Don't Ask, Don't Tell]."Endorsed: Barack ObamaMike Marsland/WireImage/Getty ImagesGeorge Clooney
Actor George Clooney was an Obama supporter before being an Obama supporter was cool. In a 2006 interview with ABC News, Clooney said then-Sen. Obama was "the most charismatic person I've been in a room with in a long time."
"I must tell you, I've never seen anybody in my life in person that was as qualified this young to do what I think we need done," Clooney said.
And six years later, Clooney is still a firm Obama supporter. Clooney hosted one of the biggest fundraisers of the year for President Obama, hauling in a record-breaking $15 million at the star-studded black tie event at Clooney's Hollywood home.
Other big names at the $40,000 per plate dinner included actors Toby Maguire and Salma Hayek, designer Diane Von Furstenberg, singer Barbara Streisand and comedian Billy Crystal.
"I'm disillusioned by the people who are disillusioned by Obama, quite honestly, I am," Clooney said on ABC News Now's "Popcorn with Peter Travers" before the October release of "The Ides of March," a political movie that he wrote, directed and starred in. "Democrats eat their own. Democrats find singular issues and go, 'Well, I didn't get everything I wanted.' I'm a firm believer in sticking by and sticking up for the people whom you've elected."Barack ObamaKevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty ImagesSarah Jessica Parker
Two weeks after the president enlisted the help of Hollywood A-lister George Clooney to host a $12 million campaign fundraiser, Obama is pumping up his star power again, only this time it's "Sex and the City" star Sarah Jessica Parker who is hosting.
Parker is not only an Obama donor, but has participated in his campaigns and his administration. She volunteered to call undecided voters in the week leading up to the election in 2008, she served on the president's Committee on Arts and the Humanities starting in 2009, and she recorded a public service announcement supporting a White House veterans program earlier this year.
"For me, this election is even more important than 2008," Parker wrote in a letter to Obama supporters. "I'm hosting this event on June 14th because there is so much at stake this year, and I want to keep doing what I can."
The "fabulous" New York City fundraiser, as Parker describes it, is likely to be a hot spot for celebrities, much like Clooney's Los Angeles gala was.Endorsed: Mitt RomneyJohn David Mercer/AP PhotoJeff Foxworthy
He already loves the cheesy grits. He has perfected the twang in his "y'all." And in order to further beef up his Southern street cred before the Alabama and Mississippi primaries, Mitt Romney called in the blue-collar cavalry.
Self-proclaimed Redneck comedian Jeff Foxworthy joined Romney on the Alabama campaign trail in March, just days before the state's primary election, after endorsing the GOP candidate via Twitter.
"Time for Republicans to unite behind Governor Romney, a great leader who can win the White House and rebuild our economy for all Americans," Foxworthy tweeted.
The "Blue Collar Comedy Tour" headliner most famous for his "you might be a redneck if..." jokes went out on the stump to support Romney amid a torrential downpour in Mobile, Ala., before traveling to two additional meet and greets in Biloxi, Mississippi and Richland, Mississippi.Barack ObamaChip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesBon Jovi
Ten days before Sarah Jessica Parker hosts her "fabulous" fundraiser, rocker Jon Bon Jovi will take the stage to serenade Obama donors at an equally-pricey and similarly-star-studded fundraising "gala dinner."
Like Parker, Bon Jovi is a longtime Obama supporter. He hosted a fundraiser for then-candidate Obama at his home in 2008 and was one of a handful of music stars who played in Obama's pre-inauguration concert.
The rock star also serves on the White House Council on Community Solutions, which promotes volunteerism and community building.Endorsed: Barack ObamaElisabetta A. Villa/Getty ImagesJames Taylor
How sweet is it to be loved by James Taylor? If you're President Obama, it's pretty sweet considering the sing/songwriter is embarking on an 18-city concert tour through a handful of battleground states.
Taylor, who endorsed Obama in 2008 as well, said he will throw a little politics between the fire and rain on his folk-rock tour this year.
"I really love this president. I love what it says about America, that we were able to elect this man," Taylor, 63, said in an interview with local North Carolina TV affiliate WCNC.
The North Carolina native will sing the president's praises in tough general election states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio and Colorado.Endorsed: Mitt RomneyGary Miller/FilmMagic/Getty ImagesTed Nugent
Hollywood may be leaning toward President Obama, but the rockers seem to be picking Romney. Ted Nugent came out in support of Mitt Romney shortly after Kid Rock made a guest appearance on the Romney campaign trial to play his song "Born Free."
Nugent announced his endorsement on Twitter, telling his 44,000 followers "after a long heart & soul conversation with Mitt Romney today I concluded this good man will properly represent we the people & I endorsed him."
Nugent, who is from Michigan but now lives in Texas, told the Texas Tribune that before deciding on his endorsement he spoke with Romney over the phone to make sure the former Massachusetts governor would not enact any gun law restrictions and would help rein in what he dubbed the "out of control" U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
"The conclusion based on all the evidence I can find is that Mitt Romney has the best shot at bringing the U.S. Constitution, common sense, and the American way back to the White House," Nugent told the Tribune.
But Romney was not Nugent's first choice for president.
"It is my firm belief that Rick Perry would have [made] and would make the best president we could choose," Nugent said, adding that he was baffled by Perry's debate performances. "If the real Rick Perry had been at those debates, he would still be in the race."Supports: Mitt RomneyCarlos Osorio/AP PhotoKid Rock
Kid Rock found his presidential jam the day before his home state's voters found their polling places. The rapper-turned-country-rocker belted out "Born Free," Mitt Romney's official campaign song, at the presidential candidate's final Michigan rally before Romney's home state voted Feb. 28.
While the musician did not actually endorse Romney, he insisted on a personal meeting with the GOP candidate before he agreed to take the stage at Romney's rally.
"The other day I got in my car and I drove out to a home of a fellow that lives in this area, and I asked him whether he might come here tonight," Romney said before introducing Kid Rock. "He said, 'If you're elected president, will you help me help the city of Detroit?' I said I would. And then I turned to him, and I said, 'By the way, given the fact that I'm willing to do those things, will you come here and perform a concert tonight for my friends, and he said he would."
Rock's pseudo-endorsement represents a change of heart for the music star. During the last presidential race, Rock, whose real name is Bob Ritchie, said celebrities should keep their political opinions to themselves.
"I truly believe that people like myself, who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight, should keep their mouth shut on politics," he told CMT Insider. "Because at the end of the day, I'm good at writing songs and singing. What I'm not educated in is the field of political science. And so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who I think they should be voting for ... I think would be very irresponsible on my part."
Rock went on to say that celebrity endorsements actually "hurt politicians."
"As soon as somebody comes out for a politician, especially in Hollywood, when they all go, 'I'm voting for this guy!' -- I go, 'That's not who I'm voting for!'" Rock said in the 2008 interview.Supports: Barack ObamaDamian Dovarganes/AP PhotoBill Maher
While another comedian makes a mockery of Super PACs, liberal jokester Bill Maher put $1 million worth of support behind the pro-Obama Super PAC Priorities USA.
Maher said he decided to write the mega-check to Priorities "partially out of fear -- fear of Santorum and Romney," who he said live in a "bubble of insanity."
"Half the country is nuts, and Obama could very well lose," Maher told the Los Angeles Times after announcing his donation in February. "He may not have been the best president in his first term, but given the alternative, I feel there's a clear choice.
"Unless the rich liberals get into the game," Maher added, "Obama will be horribly outspent. If he is outspent, he stands a good chance of losing."
Maher told ABC News that he hoped his hefty donation would inspire other wealthy Democrats to do the same.
"Hey, rich liberals," he said. "If I can do this, there's a lot of people who can do it even easier."Endorsed: Barack ObamaChris Greenberg/Getty ImagesEva Longoria
To say that actress Eva Longoria is an Obama supporter would be a glaring understatement.
Not only has the "Desperate Housewives" star publicly announced her support for the president and held high-dollar fundraisers to fill his election war chest, she is one of two big names in Hollywood who signed on to be one of 35 "ambassadors" for his re-election campaign.
Longoria will spearhead efforts to reach women and Hispanic voters leading up to the 2012 election, Obama's re-election campaign announced in February. Kalpen Modi (aka Kal Penn) is the only other actor on the list.
Before a high-dollar fundraising dinner with the president in September, Longoria told Jimmy Kimmel that Obama has been "very receptive" to her in her efforts to promote Latino issues.
"I'm a big Obama supporter no matter what he's been through -- he's been beaten up the past couple of years," Longoria said, according to the Huffington Post. "He's been very receptive for me, I'm a big advocate for Latino issues, and so he's been a big listener and he's done a lot of coalitions and roundtables regarding what we want changed."
Longoria helped raise between $200,000 and $500,000 for Obama's re-election in 2011 and in she helped inspire additional online donations in December when the Obama campaign raffled off a dinner with the actress to five online donors. Endorsed: Newt GingrichJean Baptiste Lacroix/WireImage/Getty ImagesChuck Norris
Chuck Norris' endorsement of Newt Gingrich was nearly as epic as the decades of jokes about his larger-than-life persona.
"Civilization is on the brink," Norris wrote in a WND.com editorial. "We need a veteran of political war who has already fought Goliath, because he will be facing Goliath's bigger brother. [Gingrich] is the best man left on the battlefield who is able to outwit, outplay and outlast Obama and his campaign machine."
After the endorsement, Gingrich anointed Norris as a member of his "Faith Leaders Dream Team," a group of what he called "fearless Christians" who serve as Gingrich's "official advisory coalition on issues pertaining to life, marriage, and religious liberty," according to his campaign website. Endorsed: Mitt RomneyEthan Miller/Getty ImagesDonald Trump
If you ask Donald Trump, the most important endorsement of the GOP primary was Donald Trump's, which he bestowed on Mitt Romney after a whirlwind of rumors that the real estate mogul was going to pick Newt Gingrich.
Trump officially announced his endorsement in the Trump International Hotel on the Las Vegas strip shortly before the Nevada Caucus.
"Mitt is tough, he's smart, he's sharp, he's not going to allow bad things to continue to happen to this country that we all love," Trump said. "So, Gov. Romney, go out and get 'em. You can do it."
Endorsed: Ron PaulJordan Strauss/WireImage/Getty ImagesVince Vaughn
Hollywood humor met primary politics when actor Vince Vaughn endorsed Rep. Ron Paul while introducing him at the Liberty Political Action Conference in September.
"Ron and Vince are friends, with Vince not merely interested in Dr. Paul's philosophy but he also graciously invited Dr. and Mrs. Paul to the premier of his film 'Couples Retreat,'" Paul's campaign manager Jesse Benton said in a statement, according to Slate.
Vaughn is a long-time supporter of Paul, having endorsed his 2009 book "End the Fed," as well.Endorsed: Barack ObamaFoc Kan/WireImage/Getty ImagesStephen Spielberg
Having a three-time Academy Award winning director on your side is not only good for morale; it's also great for fundraising. Director Steven Spielberg donated nearly $150,000 to Democratic election efforts in 2011, including $5,000 to Obama's campaign and $100,000 to pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. While Spielberg is a long-time supporter of the Democratic Party, he was not one of the original Hollywood Obama-backers. During the 2008 Democratic primary, Spielberg endorsed Obama's opponent Hillary Clinton. Endorsed: Mitt RomneyAlo Ceballos/FilmMagic/Getty ImagesCindy Crawford
Supermodel City Crawford was a firm supporter of Barack Obama in 2008, with both she and her husband contributing the federal limit to the Illinois senator's presidential campaign.
But in 2012, the model-turned-actress is putting her bet on Mitt Romney. Crawford appeared in an early campaign video for the former Massachusetts governor, although her spokeswoman told CNN at the time that Crawford was "not politically aligned with any party or candidate" and merely doing a favor for one of Romney's sons, with whom she was friends. Supporting: Ron PaulBrian Ach/WireImage for Clear ChannelKelly Clarkson
While pop star Kelly Clarkson did not officially endorse Ron Paul, the original "American Idol" winner tweeted some Ron Paul Revolution love to her 1.1 million followers back in December.
"I love Ron Paul," Clarkson tweeted. "I liked him a lot during the last Republican nomination, and no one gave him a chance. If he wins the nomination for the Republican Party in 2012, he's got my vote. Too bad he probably won't."
Clarkson's tepid support ignited a deluge of 140-character criticisms from her Twitter fans, many of whom were apparently unhappy about racist newsletters Paul sent out during his decades-long tenure as a Texas congressman.
Clarkson later apologized to her Twitter fans for throwing her support behind Paul.
"I am really sorry if I have offended anyone," Clarkson tweeted. "Obviously, that was not my intent. I do not support racism. I support gay rights, straight rights, women's rights, men's rights, white/black/purple/orange rights. I like Ron Paul because he believes in less government and letting the people (all of us) make the decisions and mold our country. That is all. Out of all of the Republican nominees, he's my favorite."
In an interview for Rolling Stone in March, Clarkson said she was flabbergasted by the instant outrage that her political-themed tweet incited.
"I'm hanging out with my brother and my little niece, playing Barbies, and Ron Paul comes on TV," she said according to Politico. "He doesn't BS around anything. I was like, 'This dude is refreshing.' All I did was tweet what I thought, and people went crazy! All of a sudden people were like, 'You hate gay people' -- what? I didn't even endorse him! All I said was that I liked him. I voted for Barack, so it's not even like I'm a hardcore Republican."
Supports: Ron PaulDavid Becker/Getty ImagesMichelle Branch
Apparently pop stars flock together when it comes to presidential endorsements. Shortly after Kelly Clarkson tweeted her support for Ron Paul, fellow pop princess Michelle Branch retweeted her support, writing, "@kelly_clarkson I wholeheartedly agree. #RonPaul."
Branch is best known for her early 2000s hits "Breathe" and "All You Wanted." Endorsed: Mitt RomneyFrazer Harrison/Getty Images for Relativity MediaGene Simmons
Gene Simmons, the bassist in the rock band Kiss, chose team Romney in January, telling Big Hollywood that Romney has the best chance of beating President Obama.
"Who's got a chance? Mitt Romney's got a chance and he's got the experience," Simmons said in the Big Hollywood interview. "He's run successful companies, knows how to make money. I believe Mitt Romney and President Obama are going to have a very good dialogue, and I want to hear that dialogue."
Endorsed: Ron PaulJohn W. Ferguson/Getty ImagesJoe Perry
In what is becoming typical rock star fashion, Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry used Twitter to tell the world he was voting for Ron Paul.
"Obama hasn't done anything close to what he promised he'd do," Perry tweeted in January. "Didn't get my vote and I got lotta grief. Well, my votes for Ron Paul."
Endorsed: Rick SantorumImeh Akpanudosen/Getty ImagesPat Boone
The 1950s singer, actor and author Pat Boone, 77, threw his support behind Rick Santorum, saying in a statement that Santorum is "experienced, honest and deeply principled," according to Politico.
"I am excited to endorse Rick Santorum for president. I've known Rick for many years, and Rick has been a consistent defender of conservatism and the values our great nation was founded upon," Boone said in a statement released by Santorum's campaign.
Boone, whose rendition of Little Richard's "Tutti Fruiti" sent him to the top of the Billboard charts, is an outspoken critic of President Obama. He told the San Francisco chronicle in September that he believes the president was born in Kenya, is a Muslim and is "spending millions" to hide his real birth certificate. Each charge was refuted after Obama released both his certificate of live birth and long-form birth certificate. Endorsed: Donald TrumpThomas Concordia/WireImage/Getty ImagesSnooki
The Donald might not be running for president, but if he were, he would enjoy the backing of one of his fellow reality-TV superstars, Snooki. The "Jersey Shore" diva, whose real name is Nicole Polizzi, told the Huffington Post in January that Donald Trump would be her pick for president.
"I thought Trump was going to run," Snooki told the Huffington Post. "But he's not, right? I would endorse him and vote for him."

Bristol Palin Cites 'Foolish Decision' on Virginity and 'Not Accusing Levi of Date Rape' June 27, 2011

Bristol Palin's contention that former boyfriend Levi Johnston "stole" her virginity is no attempt to bash him for their first sexual encounter, she said on "Good Morning America" today.
"I'm not accusing Levi of date rape or rape at all," Palin said on "GMA." "But I'm just looking back with the adult eyes I now have and just thinking, 'That was a foolish decision.'"
Palin also wants her mother to run for president in 2012, despite the harsh glare of the political spotlight in 2008, she said on "GMA."
"Absolutely. I think she's awesome," Palin, 20, said. "I think she's smart. I think she would be awesome for our country."
Palin, the oldest daughter of former Alaska governor and potential presidential candidate Sarah Palin, would take a lesson from the 2008 campaign, however, in which she describes her family as being "thrown under the campaign bus" by GOP running mate Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
"I think they could have stuck up for our family more," Palin said of the former presidential candidate's campaign team. "Because they never really did."
Palin is revealing much in a new memoir, "Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far," writing candidly about everything from the McCain family to her sexual relationship with Johnston, her child's father.
BOOK EXCERPT: Bristol Palin's "Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far"
In the book, released Friday, Palin writes that she "had a sneaking suspicion I might need to watch my back," after first meeting the McCain family, and describes Cindy McCain, the senator's wife, as looking "like a queen" and holding "herself like royalty."
Palin writes that she was shocked when the senator's wife offered to be a godmother to her unborn baby: "I had just met her and I wondered why she wanted any type of guardianship over my child," she wrote.
READ: Meghan McCain Responds to Bristol Palin's New Book
But Palin saves her most biting words in the book for Johnston, the father of that unborn child, her now 2-year-old son Tripp.
Johnston was Palin's high school boyfriend who, she writes in the book, "stole" her virginity on a camping trip while Palin was drunk on wine coolers.
Palin's experience as a young, unwed teen mother led her to become a spokewoman for abstinence, making hundreds of thousands of dollars lecturing to young adults about abstinence, and come under fire from critics questioning whether she was the right person to spread that message to young girls.
"I hate the word 'abstinence,'" Palin told "GMA" in response to critics. "I'm not an abstinence teacher."
Palin might not want to be held up high, but she does hope that, through her book, young girls and women can use the lessons she learned the hard way to protect themselves in their own lives.
"I hope that other women with jerk boyfriends can read the book and be like, 'You know what? I don't have to be with this guy,'" she said.
"And I think parents can read the book and open up a dialogue to their kids."
Palin writes in her memoir she and Johnston soon became intimate again after their first encounter, and she got pregnant with their son shortly after. She writes that she was taking birth control pills at the time to treat menstrual cramps; she went through eight home pregnancy tests before she was convinced of the positive results.
"I talk about in the book how I was on birth control," she said. "Abstinence is the only way that you're going to prevent teenage pregnancy. But, if you're going to have sex, practice safe sex, very safe sex."
