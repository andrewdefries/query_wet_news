How Can I Verify That An Alternative Treatment Actually Works?
Jan. 13, 2010
Brent Bauer, M.D., Mayo Clinic ABCNEWS.com
Question: How can I verify that an alternative treatment actually works?
Answer: So you need to do some homework and that usually starts at NCCAM, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. They have a great website with lots of information. There's also other sources like mayoclinic.com that has a lot of information about alternative and complementary medicine treatments. And then finally take that information to your doctor and let him or her help you make a decision about what's right for you. -- This embed didnt make it to copy for story id = 9401990.
