Now to the latest on the fiscal cliff. Just a matter of hours until we officially go over the edge. Law maikers scrambling this morning to put together an 11th hour compromise or we'll be ringing in... See More Now to the latest on the fiscal cliff. Just a matter of hours until we officially go over the edge. Law maikers scrambling this morning to put together an 11th hour compromise or we'll be ringing in higher taxes with the new year. Jonathan karl is in washington. Reporter: Good morning, dan. The taxes are set to go up at the stroke of midnight. Talks went late into the night and will continue this morning. As washington teerts on the edge of the fiscal cliff, there is still no deal. As talks continued overnight, a voice of frustration erupted on the senate floor. Something has gone terribly wrong when the big es threat to our american economy is our american congress. Reporter: Leaders negotiated all weekend long. The talks hit a brick wall. Harry reid saying, he was unable to even counter the latest republican offer. At this stage, we're not able to make a counteroffer. It appears there are things that stop us from moving forward. Reporter: That prompted mitch McCONNELL TO CALL FOR A Lifeline. I placed a call to the vice president to see if he could help jump start the negotiations on his side. I want everyone to know I'm willing to get this done. But I need a dance partner. Reporter: With that, vice president biden is now impemersed as a key player, playing a direct role in the effort to strike a last-minute deal. The key sticking points remain the same. The white house wants taxes t go up on those making over $250,000 a year. Republicans want a higher information threshold. They want to keep the estate tax from going up. There's no agreement on what to do about the automatic spending cuts set to go into effect on JANUARY 2nd. Both sides have said the cost of failure is extremely high. If we're not able to reach an agreement, it will be dire. Probably at least another million jobs lost, an unemployment rate over 9% and putting us back into recession. Reporter: Vice president biden and republican leader McCONNELL HAD SEVERAL Conversations deep into the night. The conversations were good, said a spokes person for McCONNELL. Time is almost out. The cutoff is tomorrow. We hear in your piece about the dire consequences. Most americans might not feel the effects immediately, right? Reporter: Not right away, but was thing will be felt in their very first paycheck of 2013, the payroll tax that was cut by 2%. That goes back up. The income tax cuts, the treasury has not changed the withholding tables yet in anticipation of deal. If there is no deal, they'll have to do that. You'll see a big drop in one of your early pay checks. That's not the way anyone wants to ring in the new year. We turn to abc's ron claiborne with the other news.

Felony 'Peanut' Charge Sparks Debate
April 22, 2008
By LAUREN COXABC Medical Unit A recent report of a 13-year-old spiking his peanut-allergic classmate's lunch may highlight a dangerous gap in food allergy education in schools, experts say.
An eighth-grader in Lexington, Ky., was arrested Sunday on felony wanton endangerment charges for allegedly putting peanut butter cookie crumbs in the lunch box of a classmate with a severe peanut allergy.
"The contaminated lunch box could have resulted in a significant allergic reaction — potentially life-threatening, depending on the child's history," says Dr. Kathy Sheerin, of the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic, in Atlanta.
Under the Kentucky statue for wanton endangerment, a person is guilty "when, under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, he wantonly engages in conduct which creates a substantial danger of death or serious physical injury to another person."
Whatever the courts decide in this case, peanut allergies are no trivial matter. Sheerin says peanut allergies are one of the most common food allergies, and by far the most fatal.
Fayette County schools spokeswoman Lisa Deffendall told the Associated Press that the boy's food allergy was well-known among the students at Morton Middle School.
But, experts say informing classmates of a food allergy doesn't necessarily mean all children will understand the risk for a deadly reaction, or refrain from using the allergy against the child.
Dr. Scott Sicherer, associate professor of pediatrics at the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute in New York City, has run workshops for teens with food allergies.
Sicherer says children may contaminate an allergic classmate's food by accident because they were unaware of the danger or they could do it out of curiosity, wanting to see the allergic reaction.
"Or a child could very well know that the person would be in danger and they'd like to really get that person," says Sicherer.
The School's Part
News of the Kentucky incident only reinforced food allergists' and food allergy advocates' mantra on school involvement.
"It demonstrates that having an allergy is a serous thing," says Sicherer. "One of the tenants of managing an allergy in the school setting is that bullying has to be taken seriously."
In this case, food allergic parents and advocates may be fighting a battle on two fronts. Not only are peanut allergies on the rise, so is school bullying.
The number of reported food allergies has doubled among young children in the last five years, according to researchers at the University of Chicago. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology reports 2.2 million school children currently have a food allergy.
Between 1999 and 2003, the National School Safety Center reported a consistent increase in bullying incidences across grades 6-12.
While food allergy advocates have not studied statistics of bullying combined with peanut allergy, they've heard enough reports from the community to start up peer-safety plans called PAL, or Protect a Life.
"We hear these stories all the time," said Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder and CEO of the Food Allergy and Anaphylactic Network. "The child is called peanut-kid, or the classmates wait outside the classroom and chase them with peanut butter sandwiches."

Hopes for Silicone Implants May Have Been Over-Inflated
Jan. 10, 2007 Page 2 of 2
"There is certainly a role for silicone gel implants," Friedman says. "However, there are definite disadvantages relative to saline."
He says that since silicone implants are pre-filled -- unlike their saline counterparts, which are "pumped up" only once they are in the body -- the surgeon must make a longer incision to put them in.
Silicone implants are also about $1,000 more expensive, and their risk of capsular contracture -- a condition in which scar tissue around the implant makes the breast hard and misshapen -- is higher.
And on top of these considerations, some surgeons simply prefer saline.
"There are doctors who have always embraced saline implants, even when silicone was available years ago," Antell says. "We will not be discarding saline implants just because silicone has been approved."
He adds, however, that silicone is still an important addition to the range of options available to patients.
"The important thing is that there are more options available so that the informed patient can now make her own choice," Antell says. "Some will choose saline, and some will choose silicone."

Just last night, there were three winning tickets in the $448 million Powerball jackpot. Do the holders of those winning tickets have skill, karma or blessed fortune? What makes one person luckier than others? “20/20″ reports on some of the luckiest people alive, puts some theories about luck to the test and asks, is it possible to make your own good fortune? “Got Luck?” airs on “20/20″ on FRIDAY, AUGUST 9 (10:01-11:00 p.m., ET) on ABC. “20/20″ is anchored by Elizabeth Vargas and David Muir. Reports include:
One of the Luckiest Men Alive: David Hayes of Columbus Ohio knows a bit about luck – good and bad. Last October he went on an incredible streak playing blackjack at an Ohio casino, walking away with $36,000 in cash. But some thugs were watching him. He awoke in his bed at home hours later with three armed men pointing a gun at his head, stealing his winnings. Hayes returned to the same casino and in subsequent visits won back all that money again. So, is it skill, karma, or blessed good fortune? Deborah Roberts reports.
Pennies From Heaven: What it’s it like to suddenly get a pile of cash dumped on you, when you weren’t expecting it in the least? Just ask actors Kevin Brophy and Peter Barton, former stars of the Young and the Restless, who so entertained Illinoisan Ray Fulk that he left them a $1 million estate. Amy Robach reports.
Lucky to be Alive: When expert skydiver Craig Stapleton jumped from a plane in March, it was routine until his main parachute didn’t deploy and even his back-up chute got stuck in its strings. Stapleton believed he was living the final two minutes of his life while he plummeted to earth from 8,000 feet in the sky. Matt Gutman reports on a very lucky man.
Make Your Own Luck: Can you make yourself lucky? Ty Sumrall of West Palm Beach thinks you can — especially if you buy his IGodMind brain programming videos, which he says uses binaural beats and hypnotic visuals to help your subconscious absorb “positive subliminal programming” and make yourself a better receptor for good fortune. Dan Harris speaks with Ty and a hypnotist about their approaches to attracting good luck.
Superstitions: We all know rationally that walking under a ladder isn’t really bad luck, and that rabbit’s feet don’t bring good fortune. Yet many of us still practice these superstitions anyway. Jay Schadler conducts some social experiments with skeptic Tom Shermer.
