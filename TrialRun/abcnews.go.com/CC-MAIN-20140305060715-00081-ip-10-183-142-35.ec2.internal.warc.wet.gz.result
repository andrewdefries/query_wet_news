The Top 10 Gadgets of the Decade
Dec. 2, 2009
Page 2 of 3
Digital cameras
Think back to 10 years ago. Did you get married? Graduate from college? Welcome a new child into the world?
Chances are, you didn't get to see images of those major milestones until at least a few days later. Now, thanks to the proliferation of the affordable digital camera, memories are captured -- and in many cases, shared -- nearly instantaneously.
Though the digital camera was introduced in the 1990s, it really came into its own in the 2000s, finding its way into the hands of millions around the world. Even little kids have their own digital cameras.
Unfortunately, the downside of digital photography's expansion is that your most embarrassing moments might live on the hard drives and Facebook accounts of countless family members and friends.
But the upside is that if you're fast enough, you can delete those pictures before they ever see the light of day.
TiVo Digital Video Recorder
Remember when you had to make appointments with your living room television? If you wanted to watch "Friends," "Lost" or "Monday Night Football," you had to adjust your schedule accordingly.
The TiVo Digital Video Recorder and its more recent competitors now let you record those programs and watch them at your leisure -- commercial-free
TiVo pioneered the device in 1997, but it was in the 2000s that the ad-skipping DVR really took off, sending advertisers and television programmers back to their drawing boards.
LG now offers a DVR-integrated television and some cable providers also provide DVR services.
Nintendo's Wii
When Nintendo launched the Wii and Wii Sports in 2006, it pulled gamers off the couch and into the action, revolutionizing video game play in the process.
Using a wireless controller, players actually simulate actions such as playing tennis, baseball and boxing.
But the game has had successes beyond gaming, including teaching school children music and helping people lose weight.
The USB Flash Drive
The memory disk, the jump drive, the pendrive -- or the USB.
It goes by many names but always serves the same crucial function: storing mountains of information on a miniscule device.
More durable and with more memory than its predecessor the floppy disk, flash drives help us carry documents, photos and more between work and home and school. They may be among the more humble items on this list, but simple can also be significant.
The iPhone
In June 2007, diehard Apple fans camped out on city sidewalks for days to be among the first to score the hotly anticipated iPhone. The first iPhones dropped on June 29, and within 74 days Apple had sold 1 million of its new devices.
Now it's said that the number of iPhone and iPod touch units sold has climbed to 40 million.
Whether it's with iPhones, BlackBerries, Android-powered phones or Palm devices, consumers increasingly send and receive e-mail, play games, watch video and access the Internet from mobile phones.
Thanks to the advent of the mobile application, like those in Apple's App Store and the Android Marketplace, consumers also look to their handheld devices for a host of other practical -- and frivolous -- functions.
Whatever our desire, be it finding the closest public toilet, tracking stocks or starting a car remotely, we now know that "there's an app for that."
What's behind the growth of the ever-smarter phone? Technologists say the answer is easy: the iPhone.

FULL TEXT E-MAIL: Charles Gibson Steps Down From 'World News'
Sept. 2, 2009
ABC News' Charles Gibson has announced he'll leave 'World News' at the end of the year. 'Good Morning America' co-anchor Diane Sawyer will anchor the broadcast beginning in January 2010. ABC
ABC News' Charles Gibson, anchor of 'World News', sent the following email to staff announcing his intention to step down from the broadcast at the end of the year. ABC News president David Westin announced "Good Morning America" co-anchor Diane Sawyer will anchor 'World News' starting in January 2010.
I have always been taught you should never bury the lead – so I write to tell you that I have told David Westin I want to step down as anchor of World News, and retire from full time employment at ABC News.
It has not been an easy decision to make. This has been my professional home for almost 35 years. And I love this news department, and all who work in it, to the depths of my soul.
null
I have received much comment, and quite a few emails and letters referring to the signoff Eddie Pinder convinced me to use - wishing that everyone has had a good day. But the proudest part for me has been saying "...for all of us at ABC News...", since those words signify in my mind that I have been in a position to speak for an entire news department that I consider second to none.
It had been my intention to step down from my job at Good Morning America in 2007 but with Peter's illness, Bob's injuries, and Elizabeth's pregnancy, the job at World News came open in May of 2006, and David asked me to step in as anchor. It was an honor to do so. The program is now operating at a very accelerated, but steady, cruising speed, and I think it is an opportune time for a transition – both for the broadcast and for me. Life is dynamic; it is not static.
null
I have told David I would like to continue in some capacity contributing occasionally to ABC News. He has been receptive to the idea – and we will be discussing what that role might be.
Most importantly, my heart is full of gratitude for those with whom I have had the privilege to work as a correspondent, as a host at Good Morning America, at Special Events, and now as anchor at World News.
I'll be anchoring World News through December and will have a chance to thank many of you personally. In the meantime let's get back to the news.

Diane Sawyer to Anchor 'World News'
ABC News President David Westin sent the following email to ABC News staff announcing Charles Gibson's retirement from ABC News and the broadcast he anchors. Westin also formally names "Good Morning America" co-anchor Diane Sawyer as the new anchor 'World News' starting in January 2010.
Today, Charlie Gibson announced to his colleagues at World News that he has decided to step down as anchor effective at the end of this year. I attach below Charlie's full email.
I have asked Diane Sawyer to serve as the next anchor of World News, and she will assume that position in January.
null
Charlie and I have been talking about his decision for several weeks, and he has persuaded me that this is both what he wants and what is best for him. I respect his decision, just as I respect the enormous contribution he has made to ABC News through the years.
Most recently, he stepped in to lead World News after a difficult and turbulent time – both for the broadcast and for ABC News over all. We suffered from the loss of Peter and then the severe injuries to Bob. Charlie came to the fore to keep us on the path of doing the first rate journalism that had distinguished World News for many years. We owe him much for the leadership he gave us when we needed it most.
