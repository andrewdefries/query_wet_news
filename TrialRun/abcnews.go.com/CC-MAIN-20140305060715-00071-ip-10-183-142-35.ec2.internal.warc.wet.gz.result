Jury Finds Doug Grant Guilty in Bizarre Bathtub Drowning
GILBERT, Ariz., April 3, 2009
Page 2 of 4
Remarrying in Sin City
On the drive home back to their Gilbert, Ariz., home, the couple made an odd detour and headed to Las Vegas. There, at the chapel of the Ex Calibur hotel, they exchanged wedding vows for the second time.
News of the Vegas wedding was met with skepticism by family members and friends back home. Faylene's sister Cherlene Patterson told her, "He better treat you better." Her other sister, Jody Stratton, asked Faylene several times if she loved Doug.
"She never once in that whole phone call told me she loved him. But she did tell me that ... I felt like I needed to get my family back together," Stratton told ABC News.
Doug's ex-girlfriend, Hilary, said she was stunned. But within days, she said she began receiving calls and letters from Faylene. Soon, the two women were exchanging thoughts about faith and religion in a surprising string of correspondence.
"Faylene was like a sister, a mother, a spiritual adviser, a best friend all wrapped up into one for me," Hilary told ABC News.
But some of Faylene's writings seem to indicate she was preparing for her death that she had received revelation from God that her earth life was coming to an end. In the middle of September 2001, less than two months into her new marriage, she wrote to Hilary, making an astonishing request:
"I want you to be the mother of my children. I want you to teach them how precious each of my Heavenly Father's children is [sic], and remind them that they are not only precious to Heavenly Father but to their mother who has been physically called to serve her mission elsewhere," Faylene wrote in a letter presented during the trial.

Days later, Hilary said Faylene called her and indicated her death was imminent.
"She knew she was going to die. And that it was going to be really, really soon. And she said she felt that she was supposed to have verbal confirmation from me that I would take care of her family," she recalled.
Faylene and Doug's Second Honeymoon
Faylene never said how or why she felt she was going to die, Hilary said. But these unsettling requests came just as the two had planned a sort of second honeymoon: The couple planned to visit the Mormon historical site in Nauvoo, Ill., a longtime dream of Faylene's.
But within a few days, the couple changed their plans and headed to Utah to visit the Timpanogos Cave National Monument. Soon they were a thousand feet up looking out over the breathtaking canyons. As Faylene admired the view at the edge of a sheer cliff, Doug said she slipped and fell over the edge.
"I ran to where she slipped," he told ABC News. "There's not a scintilla in my body that thought she was alive. If you look off that cliff, you don't see a tree. You just see rocks."
Doug said he ran to the base of the cliff where he said he found Faylene standing, saying she was OK. He took her to a nearby hospital, where she was treated for cuts and bruises and prescribed painkillers.
Doctors at the hospital and rangers at the canyon later disputed Doug's story of the alleged fall, saying that they would have expected to see broken bones or even death resulting from a fall at that height.
But Faylene did not contest her husband's story, nor did she express fear or anxiety after the fall. On the stand at trial, Doug's sister Tammy recalled Faylene saying about Timpanogos, "I should have died up there."
