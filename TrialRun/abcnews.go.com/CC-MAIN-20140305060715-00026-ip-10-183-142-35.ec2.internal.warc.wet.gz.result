High Debt, Poor Job Prospects Expose Legal Education Flaws Feb. 13, 2013

America's law schools, reeling from declining enrollment and bleak prospects for indebted graduates, are in desperate need of a shake-up. Says who? The legal profession.
The American Bar Association's Task Force on the Future of Legal Education met recently in Dallas. Its members called the state of law schools dire. Said Thomas W. Lyons III of Rhode Island, "There is almost universal agreement that the current system is broken."
Lyons, contacted by ABC News, spoke with candor and passion about the ills bedeviling legal education, which, he and other attorneys say, cloud the employment picture for new law school graduates and result in legal services priced high above what many Americans can afford to pay. Graduates, he notes, are entering practice lacking such basic skills as how to prepare routine legal documents.
For a long time, he explains, the theory was that new grads would get practical, hands-on training once they joined a law firm. "What do you do when a judge walks in to court?" asks Lyons. "Do you stand up, or sit down?" Law schools didn't teach that. "How do you draft a will?"
Then the economic realities of the legal profession have changed.
Before the 2007-08 recession, says Lyons, fees paid by corporate clients underwrote the cost of law firms' helping to complete the education of young associates: Whatever practicalities they hadn't learned in school could be taught them on the job, while they billed at a robust rate.
Since the recession, corporate clients have been less willing to see their money spent that way. And demand for new lawyers has diminished.
"There's no doubt whatsoever that the employment picture is very bad," Lyon says. "For the class of 2011, the percentage who got full-time jobs was about 55."
The job drought has prompted at least one school—George Washington University—to reach into its own pocket to pay graduates to keep them busy. The university's independent student newspaper, "The GW Hatchet," estimates GW has spent up to $3 million to provide legal work for more than one fifth of the class of 2012. The law school's interim dean calls the program part of GW's career services effort, aimed at helping students acquire skills rather than sit idle.
So expensive is a legal education that it's not uncommon for a jobless graduate to have $100,000 in debt.

Miranda Kerr Models Reebok's 'Lingerie' Sneakers
Supermodel Miranda Kerr models in an ad for Reebok's "Skyscape" shoes, which are made from the construction process similar to that of molded foam bras, Reebok says. The tag line for the ad states: "So comfortable you'll forget you have them on." The company says the "pillow-like" design of the sole was inspired by the home furnishings industry, while for the upper "came from the lingerie industry – and specifically, molded foam bras." In a statement, Kerr says, "I'm on the move all day so it's important to have a pair of shoes that balance comfort, style and practicality."

10 Ways to Score Oscar Recognition, Part III
Feb. 4, 2011 By SHEILA MARIKAR Natalie Portman in Darren Aronofsy's "Black Swan." Niko Tavernise/Fox Searchlight
Share ABC Entertainment News | ABC Business News

Another year, another set of movies vying for Oscar gold.
There are rules. 1) "Twilight" kids, this game's not for you. 2) Those who favor hair-poofs and no pants need not apply. 3) Stick with the tried-and-true types of films and stars the academy loves most; prepare to win big.
History, as the saying goes, repeats itself. One need only look at the Oscar winners and nominees of the past to know what's likely to captivate the academy in the present. Below, check out ABCNews.com's take on 10 ways to win an Oscar (or at least get nominated for an award), freshly formatted to apply to this year's crop of contenders.
1. Be pregnant. In addition scoring Golden Globe and SAG awards for her turn in "Black Swan," Natalie Portman has another reason to anticipate hoisting a golden statuette above her head come Feb. 27: She's pregnant. The academy long has awarded expecting actresses, including Eva Marie Saint (for "On the Waterfront"), Meryl Streep ("Sophie's Choice"), Catherine Zeta-Jones ("Chicago") and Rachel Weisz ("The Constant Gardener"). Zeta-Jones even gushed about her state when she accepted her best supporting actress award in 2003: "My hormones are way too out of control to be dealing with this!"
2. Feature a disability. Colin Firth probably should make some room on his mantel before the 27th. Besides his critically acclaimed, much-lauded performance in "The King's Speech" (Golden Globe? Check. SAG? Check.), he played a role the academy relishes: a character with a disability. Firth affected a speech impediment. Oscar winners and nominees before him have faked palsies (Daniel Day Lewis in "My Left Foot") and channeled mental illness (Billy Bob Thornton in "Sling Blade," Sean Penn in "I Am Sam").
3. Put Jeff Bridges in it. He's rugged, he's real and he's really good looking for a man his age -- 61. What's not to like about Jeff Bridges? Apparently, the academy feels the same way lately, finally having awarded him an Oscar last year for "Crazy Heart." (He'd previously been nominated four times.) Bridges is up for best actor again for "True Grit." If he wins, he'll be the sixth person in history to score back-to-back best actor/actress Academy Awards.
4. Give 'em "Bahstaan" accents. Boston or British -- if a movie boasts one of these affectations of speech, there's a 47 percent chance the Oscar committee will look its way. Previously, "Good Will Hunting" and "The Departed" appealed to the academy's proclivities towards the Red Sox, M.I.T. and the Irish mob. This time around, the Boston-based boxing epic "The Fighter" boasts seven nominations.
5. Spotlight homosexual issues. "Philadelphia." "Boys Don't Cry." "Milk." All told poignant stories concerning the LGBT community; all won Oscars. While "The Kids Are Alright," about lesbian partners whose children seek out their sperm donor father, takes a more lighthearted tone than those three films, it hits all the right notes, and thus it's up for three major Oscars.
6. Tell a horribly tragic story. There are those movies about life that induce depression, gloom, and a general feeling of, "Is this really what it's all about?" Into this melancholy category fall past Oscar nominees and winners "Requiem for a Dream," "Leaving Las Vegas," and "Monster's Ball." Current contender "Blue Valentine" (for best actress, Michelle Williams), which chronicles the crumbling of a couple's marriage, joins them in the annals of ennui.

Officials at Australia’s Taronga Western Plains Zoo are running a battery of tests to determine why four white rhinos at the zoo suddenly died.
According to the zoo’s website, the rhinos, named Izizi, Aluka, Intombi and Amira, “died suddenly after showing some neurologic abnormalities such as stumbling.”
The zoo has a veterinary team working around the clock, consulting with numerous rhinoceros specialists, virologists, and pathologists to determine the cause of death. According to the zoo’s website, “the investigation has ruled out exposure to toxins, bacterial infection, snake venom and organ failure as causes of death. ”
In the meantime, the zoo’s three remaining rhinos have been removed from the display and placed in quarantine where they remain under the close watch of the zoo’s veterinary team.
The four rhinos belonged to the southern white rhinoceros subspecies, which has an estimated population of 14,538, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The southern white rhinoceros lives primarily in Southern Africa and is viewed as a conservation success, having increased its numbers drastically from an estimated population of less than 100, a century ago. Nevertheless, the white rhinoceros remains classified as near threatened, according to the WWF.
“Obviously the Rhino keepers and veterinary staff know and care for every individual in the herd, so this has been a huge shock and we’re all very sad and supporting each other through this difficult time,” said Matt Fuller, the Taronga zoo’s general manager, on the website. ”Our focus is on continuing this investigation to pinpoint the cause of the sickness and to care for the remaining animals in the herd.”	SHOWS: World News
