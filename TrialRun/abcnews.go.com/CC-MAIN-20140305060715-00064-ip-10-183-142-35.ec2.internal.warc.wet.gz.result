Why the Tech Sector Is Poised for Recovery
Feb. 13, 2009 Column By MICHAEL S. MALONE Difficult as it may be to believe, I'm beginning to see the first signs of an economic recovery here in Silicon Valley, a breakout that might even be big enough to pull the entire U.S. economy out of our current mess.
The question now is whether the Feds will actually let it happen …
This has been, from the beginning, a paradoxical recession for me. I followed pretty closely the Credit Crisis, then the Banking Crisis and, now, the Employment Crisis. And although I've accepted the reality of these sequential economic disasters, and although I've been reporting on the bad quarterly financials of one local high-tech firm after another, there is, nevertheless, something unreal about the whole thing.
Part of this, I'm sure, is sheer denial. Although it is a natural human tendency to take diverse events and intellectually string them together into a trend, there also seems to be a countervailing tendency to take large distant events, especially if they are spread over weeks and months, and revert back to thinking of them as unrelated.
I remember my parents telling me that neither of them -- my father in Washington State, my mother in Oklahoma -- even noticed the stock market crash in 1929.
For my mother, who was sent home from school a couple times as the horizon went black in mid-day, the Dust Bowl was the cause of thousands of farmers just west of her packing up and heading to California, not economics. Rather, the Depression was just a slow, almost unnoticed, slide into a world of fewer jobs, less money and poverty.
And it wasn't until the Banking Crisis of 1933 that the magnitude of the Great Depression hit home. By then, my mother's family was living off produce from her grandparents' farms, and my father was reduced to hunting for the family table.
This downturn, too, has a kind of dreamy, slow-motion feel to it. But the fundamental difference is that, thanks to modern technology, information about our current predicament is omnipresent on the Web and cable television and available in unfathomable depth.
I can, sitting here at my computer, hit a few keys and call up thousands of blog commentaries on the stimulus package, watch videos of the key players in Congress (as well as in the administration) and even read the thousands of pages of official documents and legislation related to the crisis.
Indeed, I can say without hesitation that, unlike my parents, my relationship with this current economic crisis is not one of blissful ignorance from too little information, but something close to intellectual paralysis from having access to too much information. Did anybody in 1929 draw parallels to the Panics of 1873 or 1893? Could the average citizen obtain a copy of a draft of Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act or listen to a debate about Hoover's policies every hour on the radio?
Rushing Ahead of the Recession
But if my parents' and grandparents' generations were blindsided by the news coming out of Washington and Wall Street, just the opposite seems the case for us today. Sure, nobody seemed to have seen the Crunch coming, but once it began, the entire U.S. economy seemed to rush out ahead of it.
Even companies with good financial news embarked on massive lay-offs in anticipation of a crash. So, too, did everyday Americans suddenly showing uncharacteristic prudence, cutting back on home purchases and most other major expenditures several months before any personal financial risk became apparent. By the same token, they uncharacteristically began to save money, to such a degree that the Feds actually had to beg folks to spend more.
As a result, it has actually been difficult to separate cause from effect. Was the jump in unemployment due to the slowing economy, or the cause of it? Did capital goods orders and building starts fall off a cliff because of true lack of demand, or in preparation for that eventuality?
I'm not suggesting that the crisis isn't real, but I am curious about the role that ubiquitous information -- and let's not forget all the stories (and presidential comments) comparing the current downturn to 1929 -- has had in actually moving the curve. Did it accelerate the crisis? Amplify it? And will it shorten or lengthen it?
This isn't idle speculation because, as I wrote here several months ago, our fast-moving, digital, b

National Geographic One LifeA sailfish zeros in on a fish baitball. For the five million species that exist on Earth, the daily struggle to exist requires ingenuity, creativity and resourcefulness. Using stunning footage, culled from over 10,000 hours of material, Nat Geo WILD's series, "One Life," offers a new look at the animal kingdom. IM Global/Hugh MillerNational Geographic One LifeThe series captures unexpected and surprising animal relationships, like the work of the Strawberry poison arrow frog. It carries its newly-hatched tadpoles up trees to pools of water, and then returns every few days to feed the tadpole until it grows into adulthood.IM Global/Edwin Geisbers/naturepl.comNational Geographic One LifeAfrican elephants also look out for their young. When this baby elephant got stuck in the mud while making its way to a watering hole at Hwange National Park Zimbabwe, its new mother didn't know how to help it, so the grandmother elephant stepped in to pull the baby out.IM Global/David Paynter/ PhotolibraryNational Geographic One LifeThis Weddell seal lays on the Antarctic ice with its pup.IM Global/Joseph Van Os/GettyNational Geographic One LifeAnimals use more than instinct to survive. Like humans, they make choices and learn from trial-and-error moments. These grass-cutter ants in Argentina can't actually eat the grass, so they chop it up and carry it home, where they feed it to a fungus, which then the ants eat. IM Global/Professor Flavio Roces National Geographic One LifeTwo Japanese macaque babies, also known as the "snow" monkey, huddle together in a tight embrace that seems almost human-like.IM Global/Stephen Belcher/Minden Pictures/ FLPANational Geographic One LifeOther animals are, quite literally, freaks of nature, but have adapted to survive, such as the carnivorous plant, the Venus fly trap.IM Global/David M Dennis National Geographic One LifeThis Panther chameleon, found in Madagascar, uses its long, sticky tongue like a guided missile to catch insects.IM Global/ Stephen Dalton/naturepl.comNational Geographic One LifeLike something out of a horror movie, two stag beetles use their massive jaws to fight each other.

New Genetic Test Helps Parents Have Healthy Babies
Feb 1, 2010
By JOHN MCKENZIE and HANNA SIEGEL via Ally Zwahlen and her husband Steve are eager to start a family. They are both in good health. But they want to assess the risks: are they in danger of having children with a rare, inherited disease or some sort of devastating illness?
A new form of screening, called the Counsyl Universal Genetic Test, could give them the answers they need.
"I'm confident that it's going to alleviate a lot of uncertainties, and provide peace of mind," Ally, who is 32 and lives in Danville, Calif., told ABC News.
"Before you get pregnant, do this test"
null
Some doctors are gushing about the new test.
"I tell all my friends about it," said Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh of John Muir Health Systems near San Francisco. "You know, my girlfriends who are getting married right now and who are planning a pregnancy? I tell them, 'Before you get pregnant, do this test.'"
Unlike traditional genetic tests, which require a blood sample to help find one specific disease, the new test uses a little saliva to look for genetic markers linked to 109 inherited diseased ranging from cystic fibrosis and Pompe disease to sickle cell disease and Tay-Sachs.
null
"We are looking for mutations that parents unknowingly carry. They would have no symptoms," said Ramji Srinivasan, CEO of Counsyl, the company making the new test. "Before today, it had never been easy, convenient and reliable to get a pre-pregnancy test at home," he said. "This will dramatically reduce the incidence of diseases that are passed from parent to child."
For $350, Counsyl says it will screen the samples at its lab in Redwood City, Calif., looking for more than 400 genetic mutations. The company says the results are available in less than a week.
Other Options
If both husband and wife test positive for the same disease, there are steps they can take to protect their future children. Couples could go through in vitro fertilization, for example; doctors could check each resulting embryo and implant only those that appear free of disease.
null
Many geneticists we contacted, though excited about the new test, do urge caution.
"This new genetic test is an important first step," says Dr. Priya Kishnani, a geneticist at Duke University Medical Center told ABC News. "But the jury is still out on whether it can deliver everything it promises; whether it's as thorough and definitive as the marketing suggests."
Dr. Kishnani says some parents may be left with a false sense of security. There are many disease-causing mutations that the test does not cover. And some of the mutations targeted in the test are so hard to interpret that some couples could go through the expense and anxiety of in vitro fertilization for nothing.
null
What is clear is that more such tests will soon be on the market. The appeal can be so great: The prospect of sparing families the heartache of a new baby with a preventable disease. -- This embed didnt make it to copy for story id = 9720189.

A top FBI official testified today that Ft. Hood shooter Army Major Nidal Hasan should have been interviewed by FBI and Defense Department investigators before the deadly shooting based on reports from a field office about the major’s activities.
FBI Executive Assistant Director Mark Giuliano appeared before the House Appropriations Committee to testify about an investigative report by former FBI Director William Webster over how the FBI handled intelligence information and communications between Maj. Hasan and Anwar Al Alawki, the now deceased American-Yemeni cleric who played an operational planning role for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
“It’s easy to go back and second guess. I believe an interview would have been prudent in this case,” Giuliano told Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., chairman of the Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee.
“I am concerned that there were warning signs, and that with more aggressive investigation, there is a chance that this incident could have been prevented. I am further concerned that the reason for less-aggressive investigation may have been political sensitivities in the Washington Field Office, and maybe even the FBI’s own investigating guidelines,” Wolf said in his opening statement at the hearing.
The Webster report found shortcomings with FBI policies, technology and training in how FBI agents handled a review into Maj. Hasan before the Ft. Hood attack, which killed 13 and left 42 wounded.
Also revealed in Webster’s report were concerns from FBI Agents on the San Diego Joint Terrorism Task Force who were investigating Awlaki who passed leads onto the FBI Washington Field Office (WFO) about Hasan’s communications with Awlaki.
A task force agent wrote that “… WFO doesn’t go out and interview every Muslim guy who visits extremist websites.” The report cited of a paraphrased email from a Washington Field Office Agent to San Diego.
“Besides, this guy has a legitimate work related reasons to be going to these sites and engaging these extremists in dialogue. WFO did not assess this guy as a terrorism threat.” The email cited in the report noted about Maj. Hasan who was conducting research on Islamic beliefs and military service at Walter Reed Medical Center.
FBI agents in Washington only conducted a cursory records check of Maj. Hasan and saw that he had recently been promoted and that officials at Walter Reed believed his research was significant. The agents also believed that tipping off Hasan may have jeopardized the investigation into Awlaki.
“I think San Diego actually felt that the Washington field office should have done more. They felt they needed to be more aggressive.” Giuliano testified on Wednesday. ”What did not occur and what should have occurred is it did not get pushed up the San Diego chain of command which I think would have pushed it up to [FBI] headquarters where we would have stepped back and most likely said we want an interview to be conducted.”
Webster’s review also noted that agents in San Diego recalled that someone in the Washington Field Office noted that the inquiry into Hasan was “politically sensitive for WFO.”
“I personally do not believe political correctness had anything to do with this determination,” Giuliano testified before the committee. ”I don’t believe political correctness — nor does the report believe political correctness was the reason for that.”
“This was a judgment call. And unfortunately we make these judgment calls every single day, and we have to be right every single time,” Giuliano told the committee. ”As you look through it, an interview would have been prudent in this time. It’s hard to tell whether it would have changed things.”
Webster’s review ultimately concluded that no one was responsible for mistakes in how the Hasan case was handled, writing to FBI Director Robert Mueller: “We do not find, and do not believe, that anyone is solely responsible for mistakes in handling the information. We do not believe it would be fair to hold these dedicated personnel, who work in a context of constant threats and limited resources, responsible for the tragedy that occurred months later at Fort Hood.”
Awlaki who met two of the 9/11 hijackers at his mosque in San Diego became progressively more radicalized over the years, eventually playing a role in helping plan the failed Christmas 2009 underwear bombing plot of Northwest flight 253 and an attempt to bomb cargo planes coming into the United States in October 2010.
“[Awlaki] changed a lot over the years,” Giuliano said. “When he went to prison in Yemen in ’06, ’07, and as he came out and came back up on line in early ’08, Awlaki still had somewhat of a moderate tone — but began to be more of a propagandist, began to show more radical tendencies. We could not, and the IC did not, see him as operational or in an operational role at that time.”
Giuliano also testified before the committee that the Justice Department decided not to prosecute Awlaki in 2002 when he was detained in New York returning to the United States from overseas. Giuliano said that although an arrest warrant has been issued by Diplomatic Security for passport fraud the US Attorney’s Office in Denver decided they could not bring the case.
“So Awlaki did return in 2002. There was a Diplomatic Security Service — a DSS — warrant out for him. We knew Awlaki was coming back. We had information that he was coming back.” Giulianio testified, ”And the Colorado U.S. Attorney’s Office looked at the warrant, looked at the factual basis for the warrant. It was not an FBI warrant, and it was dismissed simply because they did not feel they had the ability to prosecute Awlaki for the alleged passport fraud.”	SHOWS: World News
