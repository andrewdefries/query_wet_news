Condoms Highly Effective Against HPV, Study Shows
June 21, 2006 By ANDREA CARTER, ABC News Medical Unit College junior Kelsey Innis knows the facts about sexually transmitted diseases but finds that many students don't.
"There's an attitude of real fear out there that doesn't breed knowledge," said Innis, who is also a sexual health peer educator at the University of Texas in Austin.
Slowing the spread of one of the nation's most prevalent STDs among college students -- the human papilloma virus, or HPV -- requires knowing how the virus is prevented. That has been somewhat of a mystery -- until now.
A new study in the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that consistent condom use can prevent the spread of HPV in up to 70 percent of cases, giving Innis and other health educators better proof that condoms can prevent HPV, helping to dispel any myths that they are not effective.
"It's the first study to nail home the point that condoms prevent against HPV transmission," said Peter A. Leone, an epidemiology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The study, conducted at the University of Washington, tracked the sexual activity of 82 female students between the ages of 18 to 22. Women

Obama: Congress Should Feel Compelled to Pass Jobs Bill

ABC News' Tahman Bradley reports: President Obama said that the economic news out today showing that unemployment claims have risen yet again compels Congress to move quickly to pass a jobs bill. Speaking on the south lawn of the White House, the president attacked Republicans in Congress for “obstructing” pending legislation. “There’s times when good people disagree in good faith, but this is not one of those time,” said the president. President Obama expressed frustration that Republicans won’t back the legislation, especially since it includes some of their ideas and has won the support of The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Businesses. “It’s obstruction that stands in the way of small business owners getting loans and tax cuts that they need to prosper. It’s obstruction that defies common sense.” The president says the bill, which has been blocked from coming up for a vote in Congress by Republicans, would cut taxes for small businesses and make loans more available. Small businesses would also be able to write off more expenses, the president said. “This is a bill that makes sense and normally we would expect Democrats and Republicans to join together. Unfortunately, a partisan minority in the Senate so far has refused to allow this jobs bill to come up for a vote,” said President Obama. The president noted that the legislation is fully paid for and will not add to the deficit. The jobs bill will come up first when Congress gets back from recess, and the president called on the Senate Republican leadership to stop their “obstruction.” Republicans complain President Obama is spending too much and not creating enough jobs. – Tahman Bradley Email
