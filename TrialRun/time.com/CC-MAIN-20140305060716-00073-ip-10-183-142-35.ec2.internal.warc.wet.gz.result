Allison Williams from Girls is Engaged to Ricky Van Veen
TIME Video
Feb. 27, 2014
Williams will wed her boyfriend of three years
Allison William’s love life couldn’t be more different from that of Marnie, her repeatedly-dumped character on Girls — the 25-year-old star is now engaged to her boyfriend of three years, Ricky Van Veen.
Williams opened up a bit to Larry King back in a January interview, saying that her father, NBC News anchor Brian Williams, liked Van Veen “a lot.” She also made it clear earlier this month that she was looking forward to having kids, telling Glamour that “my goal is to create a career I can walk away from and become a mom.”
Van Veen is the co-founder of the popular website CollegeHumor, and helped launch the video sharing service Vimeo.
