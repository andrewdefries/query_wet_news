Brown hails Afghan battle successStory Highlights Success calimed in major operation underway to retake town from Taliban Taliban militants took over Musa Qalah in February Four die as Afghan military helicopter crashes Next Article in World » Read VIDEO KABUL, Afghanistan CNN) -- Fresh from a trip to Iraq, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown arrived in Afghanistan Monday on an unannounced visit to meet with Afghan leaders and British troops who are part of NATO's International Security Assistance Force. British Prime Minsiter Gordon Brown meets UK troops in Camp Bastion, in Afghanistan's Helmand Province. Speaking at a joint news conference with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Brown vowed to continue supporting Afghanistan's path toward democracy. "Our support will continue over these next few years to make it possible for not only the security of the Afghan people but also the economic and social development of your country," Brown said. Brown's visit to Kabul -- just a day after his stop in Basra, Iraq -- came as Afghan and coalition troops entered the town of Musa Qaleh, the last significant town in southern Afghanistan's Helmand province still under Taliban control. ISAF forces killed several Taliban militants and captured 10 others Sunday in an operation that began Friday to retake the Musa Qaleh district from Taliban forces who have controlled the area for some time, according to a statement from ISAF. Brown, who visited bBritish troops in Helman before arriving in Kabul, said the military action in Musa Qaleh "is an example of how Afghan forces working with British and other forces can make a difference." "And there is no doubt that succeeding in Musa Qaleh will make a huge difference, both to how people see the weakness of the Taliban and the ability of the government to build not just militarily and politically, but with social and economic progress for the people of the area." British Defense Minister Des Browne, who was also in Afghanistan, said Sunday that retaking the district has long been a priority of the Afghan government. "The time is now right," Browne said. A combined force of Afghan and ISAF forces were searching compounds for people associated with an insurgent weapons facilitator believed to have been killed in an earlier coalition air strike in the area when they detained the 10 militants, the ISAF statement said. Several militants who used small arms to attack the forces during the search of one compound were killed, ISAF said. Don't Miss NATO operation leaves 14 dead

Two teen-age boys who were wounded by an air strike were taken to a coalition medical facility for treatment, ISAF said. Afghan National Army is leading the operation on the ground with air and ground support from British and U.S. forces, the British Defense Ministry said. Gen. Dan McNeill, the American officer who commands ISAF, said the three-day-old operation "is going (according) to plan." "As to how tough the fighting will be or will not be, that's up to the insurgents," he said. Afghan and ISAF forces began operations in the north of Helmand at the beginning of November and have made great advances in Gereshk and Sangin, the British Defense Ministry said.

FDA recalls some foods with flavor enhancer HVP FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg says the problem was identified before anyone became ill. STORY HIGHLIGHTSHydrolyzed vegetable protein is used in processed foodsSamples of the protein found to contain Salmonella TennesseeRecalled products include dips, salad dressings and soup mixes
RELATED TOPICS
Product Recalls
Food and Drug Administration
Food Safety
(CNN) -- Federal health authorities announced Thursday the recall of a commonly used flavor enhancer after samples of the product were found to contain salmonella. "I would say it's likely to be in thousands of food products," said Dr. Jenny Scott, senior adviser to the director at the Office of Food Safety at the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, about the product, called hydrolyzed vegetable protein, also called HVP. The bacterium, identified as Salmonella Tennessee, was found in HVP manufactured by Basic Food Flavors Inc. of Las Vegas, Nevada, the officials said. HVP is used in processed foods, including soups, sauces, chilis, stews, hot dogs, gravy, seasoned snack foods and dressings. "We are working hard to respond to this particular outbreak; we also are working hard to put in place the kinds of preventive control measures to prevent this kind of contamination from happening in the first place," said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg. Officials noted in a telephone conference call with reporters that no illnesses have been reported and any risk to consumers would be considered low. "Many of the foods that incorporated this product at very low levels have kill steps in place that would eliminate salmonella," said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, FDA's principal deputy commissioner. He was referring to steps in preparation that would heat the product enough to kill any bacteria. "For those that don't, we're providing specific guidance around the need to recall," he said. But officials acknowledged they did not yet know just how many products might wind up being recalled. Video: Keeping our food safe
"The manufacturer had many first-level consignees who obviously had individuals and firms that they sold to," said Dr. Jeff Farrar, associate commissioner for food safety, FDA's Office of Foods. "We expect this to get larger over the next several days to, actually, maybe several weeks." A call to the manufacturer was not returned immediately. Sharfstein said the agency learned of the problem in early February, when a Basic Foods customer tested the product and reported to FDA that it was contaminated. Farrar said he did not know when the plant was last inspected. The recall affects all bulk HVP produced at the facility since September 17. The FDA posted several dozen products containing the ingredient at www.foodsafety.gov, but officials said the list was not complete. The recalled products include dips, salad dressings and soup mixes. See the list of recalled products Farrar said the agency was recommending recalls of those products containing HVP that might be eaten without processing or cooking that would kill the bacteria. But more needs to be done, he said. "This situation clearly underscores the need for new food safety legislation to equip FDA with the tools we need to prevent contamination," said Farrar. Salmonella bacteria sometimes cause fatal infections in young children, elderly people and anyone with a weakened immune system. Symptoms in healthy people might include fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. The Center for Science in the Public Interest said the recall is "yet more proof that the Food and Drug Administration needs more authority, more inspectors and more resources to ensure that our food supply is safe." It added, "Most Americans would be stunned to learn that FDA doesn't even have the authority to make recalls like these mandatory." A bill passed in July by the House with overwhelming bipartisan support would go a long way toward beefing up the agency's ability to intervene in such cases, said Erik Olson, director of food and consumer product safety at The Pew Charitable Trusts. "The existing law is basically a reactive law," he said. "If you find contamination problems, the FDA reacts and goes out and tries to find the problem and asks for a voluntary recall." The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, the law pending in the Senate, "would change the whole system, modernize it to say we're going to try to prevent the contamination before it occurs." But support for the bill is not universal. The National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition is seeking changes in the bill before passage, according to Senior Policy Associate Kate Fitzgerald. "The last thing we want to do as a government is to inhibit these regional food systems by poorly crafted regulation," she said. Under the proposed legislation, a farmer selling broccoli heads would be classified as a farmer, but a farmer selling broccoli florets would be classified as a facility and subject to more rigorous controls, she said. "No one benefits if we pass a food-safety bill but it doesn't make the food system better," she said. Steve Etka, legislative director at the National Organic Coalition, offered a similar view. "We want to make sure the bill is clear that it's targeted toward the riskiest behaviors," he said. "Right now, we think it's kind of missing the mark in that regard."

How 'war on terror' unleashed a war on journalists By Joel Simon, Special to CNN A young man shows his press ID as Russian police detain him at a protest in Moscow on July 31. STORY HIGHLIGHTSJoel Simon: After 9/11, officials said criticism aids terrorists, secrecy all-important Press freedom eroded with demands for sources, he writes, limits on access to militarySimon: Globally, effect was worse: War on terror became a shield for repressive regimesJournalists labeled "terrorists" are jailed without charges, killed worldwide, he saysEditor's note: Joel Simon is executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based, independent, nonprofit organization that works to safeguard press freedom worldwide. (CNN) -- In the days following the 9/11 attacks, Attorney General John Ashcroft asserted that criticism of the Bush administration "only aids terrorists" and "gives ammunition to America's enemies." White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer warned that "all Americans ... need to watch what they say, watch what they do." Meanwhile, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told television executives they should not air videos from Osama bin Laden because these could contain coded messages. These statements sparked widespread concern in U.S. media circles about looming restrictions on local media. While there have been no sweeping legislative attacks on the First Amendment, press freedom has eroded domestically and globally. President Obama's record as a zealous classifier of government documents has institutionalized increased official secrecy. Legal efforts to compel journalists to reveal confidential sources are prevalent, and without a federal shield law, journalists facing a federal subpoena confront the prospect of jail. Similarly, the U.S. Justice Department has sought to imprison government employees for leaking classified information to the media. In its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military has detained journalists without charge for long periods, and failed to adequately investigate our documentation of the killings of 16 journalists by U.S. forces' fire. The killings, however, did not appear to be deliberate attacks on the media. But whatever damage was done to press freedom domestically pales in comparison to the devastating impact of U.S. post-9/11 policies on press freedom around the world. Joel Simon Anti-state charges and "terrorist" labels have become commonplace and are used to unduly intimidate, detain and imprison journalists. Media blackouts and limited access to war and conflict zones have become routine, along with the uninvestigated killings of journalists. To put it starkly, 81 journalists were in jail around the world at the end of 2000. By the end of 2001, that number shot up to 118. Today there are 145, most held on state security charges. Abusive use of national security was the single greatest charge invoked to justify journalist imprisonments in 2010, the Committee to Protect Journalists found. In fact, a good part of the increase in the last decade is directly attributable to the policies and rhetoric employed in the aftermath of 9/11, which were eagerly adopted by repressive governments around the world. The policies and rhetoric employed in the aftermath of 9/11 ... were eagerly adopted by repressive governments around the world.

In Central Asia, despotic regimes used their new strategic importance in the war on terrorism to escalate their own wars on dissidents, bundling them with the media. Since 2001, anti-terrorist rhetoric has become deeply entrenched in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. It is also a term of art in Russia, where authorities routinely use the threat of terrorism to justify repressive policies in the North Caucasus, including limits on the press. Pakistan, of course, has leveraged its critical value as an ostensible U.S. ally in the war on terror to justify the free hand given to the country's brutal spy agency, which has been accused of involvement in the murder of several probing journalists. In the troubled Horn of Africa region, Ethiopia's relative stability is largely maintained by repression of dissent and ever-increasing restrictions on the press. Since 9/11, the country has been active in U.S. counterterrorism in Somalia, but for Ethiopian journalists, reporting on terrorism without risking jail time has become too perilous. Africa's second leading jailer of journalists and notorious Internet censor routinely employs anti-terrorism laws to suppress information and accuse journalists of providing rebel groups with a platform. Accusations are not leveled exclusively at local journalists, as seen with the July detention of two Swedish journalists who were reporting on armed separatists. They and two local journalists held incommunicado since June, have just been charged with terrorism. Previously, the government has waged similar accusations against the Kenya-based broadcaster Nation Television (NTV) and against Al-Jazeera. In 2007, three New York Times journalists were detained for similar reporting. In Latin America, drug traffickers were re-branded as "narco-terrorists," first by former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, and more recently in Mexico. This repositioning allowed governments in both countries to portray their efforts to crush the cartels as part of a global anti-terror campaign, with explicit calls to the press to join the program. Uribe even labeled his critics in the media "terrorists." There are documented cases of journalists being detained, harassed and beaten by soldiers on patrol. Over the past five years, Yemen, which has instituted a near-total blackout on media reporting from the war-afflicted Saada region, has also silenced news and opinion on the basis of anti-terrorism. Reporting and opinions on Yemen's counterterrorism efforts customarily result in questioning, intimidation and detention by security forces, as in the case of prominent journalist Abdulelah Shaea, whose reporting on al Qaeda landed him in prison. In Syria, CPJ research shows, at least 11 journalistic bloggers have been found guilty of anti-state crimes under the emergency law in recent years. Anti-terrorist rhetoric continues to provide political cover for anti-press policies around the world, yet the actions of the U.S. military in Afghanistan and Iraq have also changed the ways the wars are covered. Although the embedding program that allows journalists to accompany the U.S. military has provided new opportunities for coverage, it has also created a dichotomy between embedded and "unilateral" journalists, whom U.S. forces have often viewed with grave suspicion. More than a dozen journalists have been detained by the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan and held for extended periods without charge or due process, according to CPJ research. Al Jazeera correspondent Sami Al Haj was held for more than six years as a prisoner at Guantanamo and never charged with a crime. The U.S. also bombed Al Jazeera offices in both Kabul and Baghdad, leading to the death of one reporter. These actions sent a powerful message to militaries around the world that an embedded journalist is the only acceptable way to cover their activities .The Israeli military, for example, denied the media access during their 2008 Gaza invasion. Journalists were mostly forced to cover that event from inside Israel. The Sri Lankan government used the same approach during its brutal final offensive against Tamil separatists in 2009. The absence of any independent media gave government forces a free hand, which they used to carry out massive human rights abuses including indiscriminate fire that killed thousands of civilians. The global fallout from 9/11 is a stark reminder that while the U.S. failure to uphold democratic standards has obvious implications domestically, the greatest long-term impact is likely to be in the many places where governments are always seeking justifications for unrelenting repression. Ten years on, it's clear that the anti-terror rhetoric and policies developed by the United States after 9/11 have provided effective and enduring cover for the erosion of civil liberties around the world -- including press freedom. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joel Simon.approved:sholmes.bkeenlyside simon.bkeenlyside.ricem Share this on:

Egyptian general admits 'virginity checks' conducted on protesters From Shahira Amin, For CNN Egyptian protesters get virginity tests?STORY HIGHLIGHTS17 women were arrested at a March 9 protest in Cairo, after Mubarak's ousterA senior Egyptian general says some of them were subject to "virginity checks" He says it was done so that they wouldn't claim later they had been rapedOne woman allegedly targeted had said, "They wanted to teach us a lesson" Cairo (CNN) -- A senior Egyptian general admits that "virginity checks" were performed on women arrested at a demonstration this spring, the first such admission after previous denials by military authorities. The allegations arose in an Amnesty International report, published weeks after the March 9 protest. It claimed female demonstrators were beaten, given electric shocks, strip-searched, threatened with prostitution charges and forced to submit to virginity checks. At that time, Maj. Amr Imam said 17 women had been arrested but denied allegations of torture or "virginity tests." But now a senior general who asked not to be identified said the virginity tests were conducted and defended the practice. Egypt under fire for 'virginity tests'

"The girls who were detained were not like your daughter or mine," the general said. "These were girls who had camped out in tents with male protesters in Tahrir Square, and we found in the tents Molotov cocktails and (drugs)." The general said the virginity checks were done so that the women wouldn't later claim they had been raped by Egyptian authorities. "We didn't want them to say we had sexually assaulted or raped them, so we wanted to prove that they weren't virgins in the first place," the general said. "None of them were (virgins)." However, Gen. Mamdouh Shaheen, a member of Egypt's Supreme Council of Armed Forces, said the "accusations that we did virginity tests are not acceptable. We denied it then and we deny it now." This demonstration occurred nearly a month after Egypt's longtime President Hosni Mubarak stepped down amid a wave of popular and mostly peaceful unrest aimed at his ouster and the institution of democratic reforms. Afterward, Egypt's military -- which had largely stayed on the sidelines of the revolution -- officially took control of the nation's political apparatus as well, until an agreed-upon constitution and elections. The March 9 protest occurred in Tahrir Square, which became famous over 18 historic and sometimes bloody days and nights of protests that led to Mubarak's resignation. But unlike in those previous demonstrations, the Egyptian military targeted the protesters. Soldiers dragged dozens of demonstrators from the square and through the gates of the landmark Egyptian Museum. Salwa Hosseini, a 20-year-old hairdresser and one of the women named in the Amnesty report, described to CNN how uniformed soldiers tied her up on the museum's grounds, forced her to the ground and slapped her, then shocked her with a stun gun while calling her a prostitute. "They wanted to teach us a lesson," Hosseini said soon after the Amnesty report came out. "They wanted to make us feel that we do not have dignity." The treatment got worse, Hosseini said, when she and the 16 other female prisoners were taken to a military detention center in Heikstep. There, she said, she and several of other female detainees were subjected to a "virginity test." "We did not agree for a male doctor to perform the test," she said. But Hosseini said her captors forced her to comply by threatening her with more stun-gun shocks. "I was going through a nervous breakdown at that moment," she recalled. "There was no one standing during the test, except for a woman and the male doctor. But several soldiers were standing behind us watching the backside of the bed. I think they had them standing there as witnesses." The senior Egyptian general said the 149 people detained after the March 9 protest were subsequently tried in military courts, and most have been sentenced to a year in prison. Authorities later revoked those sentences "when we discovered that some of the detainees had university degrees, so we decided to give them a second chance," he said. The senior general reaffirmed that the military council was determined to make Egypt's democratic transition a success. "The date for handover to a civil government can't come soon enough for the ruling military council," he said.

Why the Chinese are flocking to U.S. colleges
By William Bennett, CNN Contributor
updated 7:39 AM EDT, Thu May 31, 2012
A view of McCosh Hall, built in 1906, on the Princeton University campus in New Jersey. William Bennett says many Chinese want their children to attend U.S. universities.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
William Bennett: Many Chinese yearn to send their children to U.S. universities
Bennett: Chinese students better prepared in science, math; parental expectations higher
In China, U.S. colleges represent freedom, individualism, self-improvement, he says
He warns that U.S. must approach education as focused as the Chinese
Editor's note: William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor, is the author of "The Book of Man: Readings on the Path to Manhood." He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush.
(CNN) -- American higher education is in the cross hairs of a heated national debate over the value and cost of a college degree. Yet in China, our fiercest global economic competitor, the popularity of American colleges and universities might be at an all-time high.
I just returned from a trip to Beijing, where I spoke with Chinese parents about the value of American education, where we excel and where we fall short. Not surprising was the extent to which the Chinese value education, especially primary and secondary education, and yearn for their children to attend American universities, and if possible, stay in America.
When I engaged Chinese parents about their children, they would often say, "My son (or daughter) is going to Princeton (or fill in the elite American university)." I would respond, "Great! What year is your son or daughter right now?" And they would say, "Three years old."
William Bennett
This passion for education starting at such an early age is powerful. After meeting with Chinese teachers, parents and children, three differences were immediately clear.
First, their children are better educated than American children in the STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering and math. High standards and high expectations are the norm in China, not the exception, as is often the case in the United States.
Second, Chinese parents will sacrifice almost anything for their child's education. They realize firsthand, "History is a race between education and catastrophe," as H.G. Wells put it. In China, the disposable income of middle-class families is more likely to be spent on education than leisure or entertainment.
Third, to the Chinese people, American universities, for all their shortcomings and blemishes, are still beacons of freedom, individualism and self-improvement. To them, our universities are emblems of the highest achievement.
In Asia, they have a saying: "The protruding nail gets hammered down." In America, we give awards for protruding nails.
Our standards should be higher and our achievement better, but we still remain a land of unlimited opportunity. Each of my speeches in China began by reminding the Chinese people of the three, quintessential American values engraved, on our currency: Liberty, In God We Trust and E. Pluribus Unum.
Politically, we may be at odds with the Chinese regime, but its people desperately long for a taste of American autonomy. RISE China, the private international education company that invited me to China and for which I am a compensated senior adviser, focuses on teaching idiomatic English to Chinese students to help them get into American universities.
It also helps Chinese students develop confidence, initiative, commitment and active learning -- all qualities that are cherished by our higher institutions.
As a result, the number of Chinese undergraduate students in the U.S. has doubled in the past two years. In the 2006-07 academic year, 9,955 Chinese undergraduates enrolled in U.S. schools. The next year, that figure jumped to 16,450, and by 2010-11, 56,976 undergraduates enrolled in the U.S. China exports more of its students to the U.S. than to any other country. They are already reaping the benefits educationally and economically.
In February 2011, in a meeting with Silicon Valley's biggest entrepreneurs, President Barack Obama asked Steve Jobs of Apple what it would take to make iPhones in the U.S. rather than China. Jobs replied that those jobs aren't coming back. The New York Times reported it this way: "Apple executives believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that "Made in the U.S.A." is no longer a viable option for most Apple products."
The Chinese realize the potential of American universities when engaged properly.
When a student approaches the university with a specific degree focus, applies it with diligence and finances it soundly, understanding the commitment he or she is making, the American university system is still the best in the world. American students must begin approaching their higher education just as smartly and seriously, or our academies will be filled with aspiring and inquiring minds from elsewhere.

No cyberstalking charges for Petraeus' mistress Broadwell
By Carol Cratty, CNN
updated 3:24 PM EST, Tue December 18, 2012
Paula Broadwell will not face federal charges of cyberstalking. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Paula Broadwell happy to have cyberstalking case behind her, source says
She won't face cyberstalking charges, U.S. Attorney's office says
Investigators tracked e-mails back to Broadwell
The e-mails led investigators to Broadwell's affair with former CIA Director David Petraeus
Washington (CNN) -- Paula Broadwell, a woman who was romantically involved with former CIA Director David Petraeus, will not face federal charges of cyberstalking another woman friendly with Petraeus.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa informed Broadwell's attorney Robert Muse of the decision in a brief letter dated December 14.
"As the target of our investigation, we believe that it is appropriate to advise your client that our office has determined that no federal charges will be brought" regarding allegations of cyberstalking, Assistant U.S. Attorney W. Stephen Muldrow wrote.
Muse told CNN he was "very pleased that the U.S. Attorney's office in Tampa very promptly resolved this matter."

Petraeus resigned November 9 after revealing that he'd been involved in an extramarital affair.
U.S. officials said the FBI discovered Petraeus was involved with Broadwell, a woman who was under investigation for sending allegedly harassing and anonymous e-mails to Jill Kelley, a Tampa socialite who was friendly with Petraeus and his wife.
Sources close to Kelley said she had not been romantically involved with Petraeus.
During the investigation the FBI obtained Broadwell's computer and discovered she had classified materials. Investigators also searched Broadwell's home in North Carolina. Sources said the materials were technically classified but not highly sensitive. Still the FBI and Justice Department prosecutors have not resolved whether Broadwell will face charges for having such materials in her personal possession.
Sources close to Broadwell acknowledged that issue has not been resolved.
Broadwell, 40, wrote a biography of Petraeus, a retired general who led U.S. forces in Iraq and later in Afghanistan. A former Army reservist, Broadwell's security clearance was suspended after details surfaced about her possessing classified materials.
During the investigation it also came to light that Kelley and Army Gen. John Allen were exchanging e-mails, some of which might have been considered inappropriate. That matter was turned over to the Pentagon's inspector general for investigation.

Gun makers, help keep weapons out of criminals' hands
By Kevin Bradford, Special to CNN
updated 11:16 AM EST, Wed January 30, 2013
A trash bin holds handguns collected during a recent gun buyback program in Los Angeles.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Kevin Bradford: Each year 30,000 killed and 300,000 violent crimes committed with guns
It's also a marketing problem, he says. Manufacturers are not monitoring distribution of guns
Bradford: Laws are minimal, manufacturers are not putting safeguards into place He says use gun lobby tactic: Grade manufacturers on ability to keep guns from criminals
Editor's note: Kevin D. Bradford is an associate professional specialist in marketing at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. He teaches and researches issues within the marketing system and its relationship to society. On Thursday, watch the Anderson Cooper 360° Town Hall: "Guns Under Fire" at 8pm ET on CNN.
(CNN) -- Each year, about 30,000 people are killed and 300,000 violent crimes are committed with firearms. In economic terms, firearm violence -- for things such as medical care, police, criminal justice, lost productivity, pain and suffering -- costs $100 billion a year, according to studies by Johns Hopkins University and the Public Services Research Institute.
This reality tears at the social fabric of the United States, and Americans pay the social and psychological consequences. But the gun debate will continue to be a one-sided fight until the American public chooses to take action.
Kevin Bradford
Most of the debate revolves around what government should do. But we can also look at the issue as a marketing problem. American consumers are the central part of a vast aggregate marketing system, and the central issue as it pertains to guns is power.
The gun lobby has wielded its power effectively, but the potentially powerful American consumer market has not. The gun lobby influences how guns are marketed and under which laws. The only difference between the gun lobby and concerned Americans is that the gun lobby -- and thus the politicians supporting the gun lobby -- pays attention to details.
Opinion: In the gun control debate, logic goes out the window
It has made its primary goal to vehemently block any change to gun laws for fear that passage of even one law could lead to the eradication of firearms for all.
But that is not the issue here. Many concerned citizens are not advocating the abolition of firearms for responsible gun owners.
The problem is that there are too few and very limited laws to force manufacturers to safeguard their distribution channels, and manufacturers are not putting these safeguards into place.
Our research found that about 45% to 60% of the guns traced to crime came from about 1% of the nation's gun dealers and that implementation of safeguards is associated with a smaller number of guns being diverted to crime or used in crime. Interestingly, many of the common sense distribution laws that would force a safer distribution of firearms are in place for other industries that sell products that can cause harm.
Opinion: A father's murder, a plea on gun control
Firearms product diversion involves the seepage of guns from legal channels of distribution into illegal hands.
Gabrielle Giffords: We must do something
Feinstein bill targets assault weapons
To prevent this from occurring, firearms manufacturers have the opportunity to implement distribution safeguards, common across many of the industries that manufacture products that can cause harm (such as explosives, fireworks, and pharmaceuticals).
Such safeguards include manufacturers training their dealers and distributors to identify and handle illegal purchasers at the point of sale, developing a code of conduct for distributors, and requiring them to implement record keeping measures in order to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
Gabby and Mark: The new 'Bradys' of gun control The notion of safeguarding is important because a recent study found that 1 in 9 (11%) of handguns distributed into legal channels in 1996 were found to have been used in crime by 2000. It was also found that one manufacturer had 55% of its guns end up in crime during this time period (the range was 2% to 55% for all manufacturers studied).
This study also found that the number of safeguards used across the studied firms (which accounted for over 90% of the U.S. gun sales) was very low, averaging less than one safeguard (.77) per firm. Only a slight majority employed any recommended safeguards during that time.
One reason the public has not been paying attention is that they think the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives can address enforcement for us. But at this point, the bureau needs our help -- it does not have the resources to combat this problem, because gun lobbies and the politicians who support them have tied its hands. So, Americans must act.
The National Rifle Association grades political candidates on their voting history, giving high marks to those who vote for its policies. These ratings influence how guns are distributed in the United States.
In response, concerned citizens should do the same thing.
We should grade firearms manufacturers on how well they address distribution and the diversion of their guns to criminals. Americans should look at these grades and buy firearms accordingly.
The group Mayors Against Illegal Guns suggests that if manufacturers don't comply with set goals of safety, the nation's mayors and municipalities will not do business with them. Concerned Americans should follow suit.

America's 'Slave Narratives' should shock us
By Bob Greene, CNN Contributor
updated 8:37 AM EST, Sun February 17, 2013
An elderly woman, who was born a slave, photographed in 1941 in a farm near Greensboro, Alabama. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
During Great Depression, writers project interviewed former slaves
Bob Greene says the stories in the "Slave Narratives" are shocking to read
They tell of families torn apart, of people deprived of their basic freedoms Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose 25 books include "Late Edition: A Love Story"; "Duty: A Father, His Son, and the Man Who Won the War"; and "Once Upon a Town: The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen."
(CNN) -- "I was owned by Johnson Bell and born in New Orleans, in Louisiana."
Those words were spoken by a man named Frank Bell.
He said that according "to the bill of sale, I'm 86 years old."
Bob Greene
His words, and those of thousands of other American citizens, were transcribed in the 1930s, at the depth of the Great Depression. As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's efforts to restart the economy, the Works Progress Administration was founded, and one arm of the WPA was something called the Federal Writers' Project.
Men and women were hired by the government to work on various assignments documenting American history and American life.
One of those assignments, vast in scope, came to be known as the Slave Narratives.

"If a woman was a good breeder she brought a good price on the auction block," said Hattie Rogers, a North Carolina resident, when she was interviewed in 1937. "The slave buyers would come around and jab them in the stomach and look them over and if they thought they would have children fast they brought a good price."
We are in the midst of Black History Month. The slave years in the United States were not only black history, they were American history -- the ugliest and most indefensible chapter.
I had long heard of the Slave Narratives, but had never read them. The original interviews comprised 17 bound volumes in the Library of Congress, filled with the firsthand accounts of more than 2,000 former slaves, and hundreds of photographs.
The interviewers were sent to 17 states, and that is how the printed conversations are bound and arranged. I have been reading two volumes -- covering interviews done in North Carolina and in Texas.
1865: Lincoln talks of 'sin of slavery'
What is so shattering is the matter-of-fact tone of what the former slaves said. The United States was well into the 20th century by the time the interviews were conducted; automobiles had come to the nation, as had radio and motion pictures and air travel. The country, in many ways, was beginning to resemble the nation we live in now.
Yet residing in America's cities and towns were men and women who recalled being sold at auction, of seeing brothers and sisters led away in chains, of having -- in their words -- "good owners" or "cruel masters." Survivors of a time when, in many states, it was perfectly lawful for human beings to own other human beings, and to buy and sell them.
Mary Armstrong, 91 and living in Houston when she was interviewed, said the person who owned her family was "so mean he never would sell the man and woman and (children) to the same one. He'd sell the man here and the woman there and if (there were children) he'd sell them someplace else."
Charity Riddick, 80, interviewed in North Carolina, had a similar memory. "I belonged to Madison Pace in slavery time," she said. She had a brother whose first name was Washington, she said, but he was "sold away." Their mother "cried a lot about it."
The former slaves who were still alive in the 1930s were, of course, the youngest of those who were enslaved before emancipation. Many of them were relating childhood or adolescent memories, while others were passing on what their parents related to them.
There were many, however, who were old enough to have vivid firsthand recollections of specific instances. Stearlin Arnwine, who was 94 and living near Jacksonville, Texas, when he was interviewed, said he would see slaves on the auction block, stripped to the waist for inspection by potential buyers. Women and their children, he said, would be crying and begging "not to be separated," but it did no good: "They had to go."
As anguishing as are the stories recounted by the former slaves, troubling in a different way was the methodology many of the interviewers chose in committing the stories to written form. Most of the writers were white; in the 1930s, apparently it was still considered acceptable to use crudely rendered dialect in recreating on paper the speech patterns of African-Americans. That is how some of the writers transcribed the interviews, and in many cases it comes off as something close to mockery, whether or not it was intended that way.
The power of the stories overrides everything else. The quiet starkness of the telling:
"My father was a slave, A.H. Stewart, belonging to James Arch Stewart, a slave owner, whose plantation was in Wake County," said Sam T. Stewart, 84, interviewed in North Carolina in June 1937. "When I was two years old James Arch Stewart sold my father to speculators, and he was shipped to Mississippi. I was too young to know my father."
You can read from the volumes for hours at a time, and when you are finished for the evening you can look around you and try to comprehend that all of this was taking place in the same nation where we live today.
Alex Woods, of Raleigh, North Carolina, born on May 15, 1858, said that as a boy he saw slaves being marched on their way to the auction block, each person chained to the one next to him, and, as he witnessed this, being "afraid my mother and father would be sold away from me."
Story after story after story. Henry H. Buttler, 87, living in Fort Worth in the 1930s but born a slave in Virginia:
"The plantation consisted of about 30 acres, with about 30 slaves, though this number varied and sometimes reached 50. Mr. Sullivan owned my mother and her children, but my father was owned by Mr. John Rector, whose place was adjacent to ours."
And, when Abraham Lincoln proclaimed that this must no longer be permitted to go on, millions of Americans said that he was dead wrong.

Howard Kurtz: NBC's plan to replace Jay Leno sits well with critics
He says Leno's brand of comedy appeals to much of America
Critics are free to prefer Fallon, Kimmel, but replacing Leno is risky, he says
Editor's note: Howard Kurtz is the host of CNN's "Reliable Sources" and is Newsweek's Washington bureau chief. He is also a contributor to the website Daily Download.
(CNN) -- The news that NBC plans to dump Jay Leno -- again -- lifts the curtain on a dark corner of the media business.
Is it the fact that a network could be thickheaded enough to call the same play that blew up last time with the Conan O'Brien debacle? Nah. That's pretty obvious.
It's the way that television critics despise Leno, and how that colors the coverage of the late-night wars.
Howard Kurtz
When The New York Times' Bill Carter broke the story last week that NBC is ready to hand "The Tonight Show" to Jimmy Fallon in 2014, there was this line buried deep in the piece: "Another complicating factor has been Mr. Leno's success in the ratings."
Let's ponder that for a moment. Leno has the top-rated show at 11:30. NBC executives are nonetheless planning on booting him when his contract expires in the fall of 2014 and moving the show from Burbank, California, to New York.

Imagine how that story line would play out if critics and reporters viewed Leno as sympathetically as they do, say, Fallon or Leno's ABC rival, Jimmy Kimmel.
What?? NBC is kicking Jay to the curb? The guy who has made the network hundreds of millions of dollars over the last two decades? The man who bounced back from his last firing and regained the late-night throne? What did he do to deserve this?
Instead the media reaction is a collective shrug of the shoulders: Yeah, makes sense. Time to wheel the old guy off the stage. Jay hasn't been funny since the Clinton administration and Fallon appeals to a younger crowd.
Late night war rages with Fallon, Leno
Jay Leno jokes about NBC
Watch: Do the critics want Jay Leno booted off the stage?
Time's James Poniewozik writes that "Jay 'It's just a business' Leno deserves no man's pity however this plays out." The Atlantic complains about his "groan-worthy jokes."
But here's the thing: Leno doesn't appeal to anyone but the viewers. At least those who live west of the Hudson River and east of the Santa Monica Mountains. He does broad comedy and hardly wields the kind of cutting-edge style favored by the bicoastal elites. But much of America likes him.
Does the 62-year-old comic skew old? Well, he's been beating Kimmel and David Letterman even in the coveted 18-to-49 demo.
Watch: Is the press now forgetting the horror of Newtown?
The critics made the same mistake last time around. Conan was so much funnier than Jay that giving him "Tonight" rather than risking his departure was a brilliant move by NBC. Except that O'Brien's quirky humor appealed to a narrow slice of the audience, the ratings plummeted, and a $32 million payout later, he was gone and Leno was back.
Leno has been punching back in his monologue, likening NBC suits to "snakes" and saying that the network's motto is "The Biggest Loser." The Times reports that a top executive ordered Leno to stop mocking the network, a ham-handed attempt at censorship that has obviously failed.
One strange twist is that some conservative pundits are carping that NBC is ousting Leno because of his jokes about President Obama (he ribs every president) and because, unlike the more openly liberal Letterman, he appeals to the heartland.
It's obviously more of a dollars-and-cents gamble that Fallon is the future. And indeed, Jimmy Fallon makes sense as Leno's eventual heir.
Watch: Is there a double standard in gay marriage coverage?
But in their haste, NBC execs risk blowing up the situation the way they did in hustling Ann Curry off the "Today" show, sparking a backlash against Matt Lauer and sending what had been the iconic morning show plunging into second place. Their prime-time lineup is in fifth place. Do they really need to immolate one of the few time periods where the network is No. 1? Fallon's a young guy. Johnny Carson was 66 when he stepped down. What's the rush?
The critics, of course, won't be happy until Leno is working the comedy clubs where he spends his vacations (and possibly competing against NBC from Fox). And they are entitled to their views of who has comedic chops and who is out of gas. But in this case, they're out of touch with the people who vote with their remote controls.

Hey, Miley, Suzanne Somers is having lots of sex
By Lisa Respers France, CNN
updated 6:33 AM EDT, Fri October 11, 2013
Christie Brinkley will turn 60 on Sunday, and she's celebrating by showing off her birthday (swim)suit on the cover of People magazine. The model and mom of three said she is feeling better than ever as she heads toward the milestone. "I'm actually excited about turning 60," Brinkley told People. "My 50s weren't easy. ... But I made it through. Now I feel on top of my game." Here are a few other celebs who are sexy in their 60s. Oprah Winfrey turned 60 on January 29 and said she is feeling healthy and strong. "I no longer have to be concerned about what anyone thinks of me!" the media star said on her birthday. "I'm turning 60, and I've earned the right to be just as I am. I'm more secure in being myself than I've ever been."
Miley Cyrus said on her October 7 appearance on "Today" that she's heard people over 40 "don't have sex anymore." Leave it to Suzanne Somers, 67, to correct the 20-year-old singer. The former "Three's Company" star told the ladies of "The Talk" that she and her husband of 36 years, Alan Hamel, 77, actually have sex "a couple times a day." Listen to your elders, Miley. Actor Kurt Russell, 62, and partner Goldie Hawn, 67, are championed as one of the happiest unmarried couples around. Whenever we see them, they're always beaming. Onlookers at a New York movie premiere in September commented that the two could hardly keep their hands off one another. If anything, Meryl Streep has only gotten sexier with age. The Oscar winner, now 64, has single-handedly pushed past the notion that actresses should leave Hollywood when they hit 30. In the eyes of The Telegraph's film critic David Gritten, it all comes "down to sex. ... Apart from her remarkable skills as a film actress, there's a glow, a sensuality and a radiance about Streep these days. Put simply, she's looking great."
How many 61-year-olds know what it's like to have the Internet practically squeal with glee at the sight of them in boxer-briefs? Liam Neeson does. At 67, Cher has no need to turn back time. On the cover of her latest album, "Closer to the Truth," the singer proved how young she feels in skimpy lingerie, and she's been known to tweet photos of herself in fishnets and knee-high boots. When one fan responded to one such picture asking if Cher has "discovered how to get hot boys yet," Cher responded, "I'm way too old for hot boys. Hot men, now that's another story."
When 64-year-old Richard Gere opened a boutique hotel in 2012, he told CNN he had a very clear understanding of what he wanted the design to convey. "Sex -- every choice in here was about sex," People's former Sexiest Man Alive told CNN. And yet, the guy doesn't believe that he has "a certain impact" on the opposite sex. Musician Sting, 62, has never been shy about sharing details of his sex life. He and wife Trudie Styler aren't quite having tantric sex for hours, as rumor has claimed, but they do like to keep things spicy. "I don't think pedestrian sex is very interesting," he told Harper's Bazaar in 2011. "There's a playfulness we have; I like the theater of sex. I like to look good. I like her to dress up. I like to dress her up. ... Romantic? We like tawdry."
Jessica Lange nearly set the big screen on fire with her steamy work alongside Jack Nicholson in 1981's "The Postman Always Rings Twice." But at 64, Lange's bedroom is still the source of speculation -- last year, her rep had to debunk a rumor that she was "making sweet music" with her "American Horror Story" co-star, Sarah Paulson. If you ever start to doubt that sexiness has no expiration date, just remember Helen Mirren. First came that bikini. Then, in 2010, around age 65, Mirren pulled ahead of Megan Fox in Esquire magazine's Sexiest Woman Alive tournament. But the now 68-year-old's response to all the attention is even better: "We have to let go of this crap," Mirren told The Hollywood Reporter that same year. "It creates even more pressure on women, and I certainly don't want to be a part of that. ... The fact that I look good at the age I am is bloody irrelevant."
Now 60, Pierce Brosnan can still play the older gentleman who falls for a younger lover, as he did in this year's "Love Is All You Need." It has been 12 years since the former 007 was named People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive, but Brosnan is secure in his standing. "There's nothing to prove," he told "Today" in April. "I feel comfortable in my own skin." Some of Pam Grier's "Foxiest" work is older than some of her fans, but the film star's still got it. As a cancer survivor at 64, Grier says battling that disease has taught her "how close I came to death, and how far I can go in life. ... A lot of women think that after menopause you won't care about being sexually intimate with a man. I don't know if that's true or not, but I know for many women, including myself, we don't know we had it. All we know is, we good to go!"
Bruce Springsteen, 64, is sexy -- and he knows it, as he proved in his cover of LMFAO's song on "Late Night" in 2012. And have you seen his abs?
The secret to Jeff Bridges' sex appeal? Keeping it real. As the 63-year-old said in 2010, "Being a sex symbol is all about honesty - that's not how I see myself at all, but I think the attractive men are the ones who show you who they are."
"Today" personality Kathie Lee Gifford is an open book at 60. She'll happily talk freely about pubic hair care -- or how sex after 40 is all about quality, not quantity. (Tell that to Suzanne Somers.)
Like many of her 60-something counterparts, Jane Seymour has no problem getting cast in a sensual role. The 62-year-old actress recently appeared on "Franklin & Bash" as a "sex surrogate." At 68, Tom Selleck is just as sexy as he was back in his "Magnum, P.I." days. (We think it has something to do with the mustache.) Even his 20-acre avocado ranch is "vaguely sexual," as he told Conan O'Brien in 2011. Is it any wonder Bill Cosby's "Cosby Show" character, Cliff Huxtable, was always trying to get quality time with his wife, Clair? With Phylicia Rashad, who's still just as classy at 65, in the role, it was totally believable.
Susan Lucci embodied sex appeal for decades as Erica Kane on "All My Children." Now 66, the actress has taken her spark from daytime to prime time -- she's starring on "Devious Maids," which she's described as a combination of "intrigue and murder, mayhem, little surprises and sexy. ... All the good stuff."
Susan Sarandon was once told her sexy days would soon come to an end before she even turned 40, and the actress recalled last year that she (rightly) laughed at the notion. Now 67, Sarandon says sensuality is "really more of an attitude than it is being naked," she told People magazine. "I'm happy to be considered desirable. I love it!" For some reason, former "Charlie's Angel" Jaclyn Smith never considered herself to be a sex symbol, but we politely disagree. At 67, Smith, a cancer survivor, still has the poise and beauty we were first introduced to years ago. Check out how she stunned the co-hosts of "The Talk" last fall. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Suzanne Somers says she and her husband are having lots of sex
Miley Cyrus said in an interview that she heard sex slowed in one's 40s
Somers said she and her husband are both on hormones
(CNN) -- Miley Cyrus, forget what you've heard. Suzanne Somers wants you to know she is having plenty of sex, thank you very much.
The 66-year-old former "Three's Company" star told the ladies of "The Talk" on Tuesday that she and her husband have sex "a couple times a day."
"He's on hormones; I'm on hormones," Somers said, to the delight of the show's co-hosts.
Somers' comments came after Miley Cyrus told Matt Lauer on "Today" on Monday that it was her understanding that people in their 40s aren't having sex.

"I heard when you turn 40, things start to go a little less sexual," she said. "Probably around that time, I heard that's when people don't have sex anymore."
Not according to Somers.
The actress has revealed that she and her husband of 36 years, Alan Hamel, usually start the day off well.
"There's some level at 4 in the morning, and then I'm really awake around 8 or so," she said. "We have busy mornings."
The actress and breast cancer survivor has been making the rounds promoting her new book, "I'm Too Young for This."

Wine labels: How to read them
November 19, 1998
Web posted at: 11:20 a.m. EST (1620 GMT)
RELATED:
Wine Prices -- Find out how much you'll pay
Wine Varietals -- Use our glossary
Alcoholic Drinks - Compare the nutritional value of wine against other alcoholic beverages
Quick Facts - Take a look at the origin of alcohol and guidelines for safe consumption.
(CNN) -- Labels on wine bottles can be works of art, but federal and state laws also
require they include certain information. Understanding the wine label can
help you as a consumer understand what you're buying.
On the label:
Brand/Producer name - The name chosen by the bottler.
Type of wine - This may be a varietal, generic or proprietary name. Varietal
wines must be made from 75 percent of the grape variety named. Place of origin - The geographical growing area. If a state name, such as "California," is used on the label, then 100 percent of the grapes used in the wine must be grown within the state. If a county name is used, 75 percent of grapes used must come from that county. To use an AVA (a federally approved viticultural area), 85 percent of the grapes used must come from the defined area. Vintage - The year the grapes were grown. At least 95 percent of the grapes
used in the wine must be of the vintage claimed on the label.
Individual vineyard - At least 95 percent of the grapes used in the wine
must come from the vineyard named on the label.
Alcohol Content - If a wine exceeds 14 percent alcohol, that must be
displayed on the label. Wines designated as table wines (seven to fourteen
percent alcohol) are not required to put alcohol content on their labels.
