Dieters in Weight Watchers study drop up to 15 pounds in a year
By Amanda MacMillan
updated 4:18 PM EST, Wed January 4, 2012
Research has shown that dieters are more likely to stick with weight-loss programs that stress accountability.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
People lost more on Weight Watchers than with docs' advice, WW study says Studies of other weight loss plans have had comparable results
Researchers were surprised at participants' dedication
Weight Watchers funded the study but had no control over design or results (Health.com) -- Overweight and obese adults who followed the Weight Watchers program lost more than twice as much weight as those who received weight-loss advice from a doctor or nurse, according to a new yearlong study funded by the company.
The study, which was published Wednesday in the Lancet, included 772 men and women in Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom who were recruited during ordinary doctor's appointments. The researchers randomly selected about half of the participants to receive a free 12-month Weight Watchers membership (including access to weekly meetings), and encouraged the other half to attend monthly one-on-one weight-management sessions at their doctor's office.
The 61% of Weight Watchers users who stuck with the program for a full year lost 15 pounds, on average, compared with 7 pounds among the 54% of people in the other group who continued to visit their doctors each month. When the researchers included the people who dropped out of either program before the year was up, the average weight loss was lower but followed the same pattern: 11 pounds in the Weight Watchers group and 5 pounds in the other group.
Health.com: 25 ways to cut 500 calories a day Michael Jensen, M.D., an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, says it's only natural that the weekly weigh-ins and "group spirit" of programs such as Weight Watchers would prove more effective than occasional guidance from a doctor or nurse, since research has shown that dieters are more likely to stick with weight-loss programs that stress accountability.
"It's not terribly surprising that a group whose whole career is basically helping people with weight management would do a better job than a primary-care group that has a lot more responsibilities on top of that," says Jensen, who was not involved in the study.
Similar studies of other commercial weight-loss systems, such as Jenny Craig and prepackaged food programs, have produced comparable results in the past. In a 2010 study funded by Jenny Craig and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, for instance, women who completed one year of the program lost about 20 pounds, three or four times more than women who received occasional advice from a nutritionist.
Health.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat Still, the authors of the new study say they were surprised by how dedicated the Weight Watchers participants were—they attended three meetings a month, on average—and by how much weight they actually lost.
"I don't think we could have predicted that people randomly allocated to Weight Watchers by their doctor—rather than choosing to attend of their own accord, which would give a selected group of probably more motivated people—would lose significantly more weight," says lead author Susan Jebb, Ph.D., a diet and population health researcher at the UK Medical Research Council, in Cambridge.
People may be more likely to stick with a program like Weight Watchers when they're participating free of charge, however. The cost of Weight Watchers can run as high as $500 per year, a price tag that could sap the motivation of real-world dieters who are paying out of pocket. At the same time, Jensen says, it's possible that some people paying out pocket might be less likely to drop the program because they'd feel obligated to get their money's worth.
Health.com: Best superfoods for weight loss The study participants had a body mass index (BMI) between 27 and 35 and at least one additional risk factor for obesity-related disease, such as excess belly fat or a family history of diabetes. (People with a BMI over 25 and 30 are considered overweight and obese, respectively. A 5-foot, 6-inch woman with a BMI of 27 weighs 167 pounds.)
People in the Weight Watchers group were three times more likely than the other participants to lose 10% or more of their initial body weight. And nearly two-thirds of the Weight Watchers users lost 5% or more of their body weight, versus one-third in the other group.
"Those really are medically very significant numbers," Jensen says. "For overweight or obese people, that kind of loss results in pretty substantial improvements in health and disease risk—to the point where, if you're on medication for blood pressure or cholesterol or diabetes and you can [lose] 10% of your weight, you've got at least a reasonable chance of decreasing or discontinuing that medication."
Health.com: The 10 best foods for your heart Jebb and her colleagues say that partnerships between primary care physicians and commercial weight-loss programs like Weight Watchers could be an effective and inexpensive way to treat certain people who struggle to maintain a healthy weight.
A cost-benefit analysis will be needed to determine whether doctors should recommend such programs to their patients more often, and which patients might benefit the most, Jebb says. But, she adds, the programs appear to be promising and may be more cost-effective than one-on-one doctor's appointments, not to mention untreated obesity complications.
Although Weight Watchers sponsored the study, Jebb stresses that the company had no control over the design or results. "Our research contract included a clause to allow us the right to publish the data regardless of the outcome," she says.

Squash given chance for Olympic place, wrestling wins reprieve
updated 1:57 PM EDT, Wed May 29, 2013
Malaysia's seven-time world champion Nicol David is hoping to compete at the 2020 Olympics.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Squash, baseball/softball and wrestling shortlisted as potential sports for 2020 Olympics
Vote to be held by International Olympic Committee in Argentina in early September
Winning candidate will be added to the 25 core sports, plus golf and rugby sevens
IOC president Jacques Rogge impressed with presentations for final remaining place
(CNN) -- Squash, the bridesmaid of racquet sports, will hope to finally recognize its Olympic dream after winning a place on the shortlist of candidates to be included at the 2020 Games.
While tennis, table tennis and badminton have long been on the Olympic agenda, squash has failed to impress the International Olympic Committee during its previous attempts, with campaigns to be included at London 2012 and Rio de Janeiro 2016 falling on deaf ears.
But Wednesday's announcement by the IOC means it, along with wrestling and the combined baseball/softball bid, will have the chance of securing the one final place in September's vote.

There is the offer of a reprieve for wrestling, which was dropped from the program in February, while baseball and softball were axed after the 2008 Games but have since streamlined their competitions in order to win back favor.

Wrestling had long been considered an iconic Olympic sport having been part of the Games since its inception in 1896 and missing out just once -- at Paris in 1900.
Both freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling had been mainstays of the Olympics, but this year's shock decision led to the sport's chief Raphael Martinetti resigning as President of the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles.
Golf and rugby sevens are two new sports to be included at Rio next year and squash is now hoping it will finally make its debut in 2020.
"This is a great day for squash as it takes us one step closer to realizing our long-held ambition to join the Olympic Games," Malaysia's seven-time world champion Nicol David said in a statement following the announcement.
Read: Squash gladiator Nicol David "I said to the (IOC) Executive Board that the one big regret in my career is that I have never had the chance to compete in the Olympic Games, but I would happily trade all my seven world titles for the chance of Olympic gold.
"Hopefully that showed what competing in the Games means to me. It was a true honor to play a part in our presentation and I will do everything I can as we head towards Buenos Aires to help our campaign."
Squash will now hope to succeed where the likes of wushu, wakeboarding, roller sports, karate and sport climbing failed, missing out on contention for consideration.

The sport has tried to make itself more attractive to the IOC, using all-glass courts, video review systems and a white ball to help make it more spectator-friendly.
"Squash would grow all over the world with the Olympic Movement," World Squash Federation President N. Ramachandran said in a statement. "We are a growing, global sport played in 185 countries by millions across the world.

"We offer the genuine prospect of new nations on the medal podium. We would be easy and low cost to integrate into the Olympic Games with just 64 athletes, two competition courts that can be built in days and we have a great track record of being hosted in iconic locations.
"I think all these elements were important considerations for the IOC Executive Board. It is critical now that we build further momentum and support ahead of the IOC member vote in Buenos Aires on September 8, and this is what the global squash family is completely focused on."
The IOC uses 39 criteria to decide which sports make it through to the Games, with categories such as popularity, good governance and respect for the Olympic values all taken into consideration.

IOC president Jacques Rogge, who is set to step down in September following a 12-year term, told reporters he was impressed with the presentations put before the 14 board members.
"The Executive Board received excellent presentations today from eight International Federations," he said.
"It was never going to be an easy decision but I feel my colleagues on the board made a good decision in selecting baseball/softball, squash and wrestling to be put forward in Buenos Aires.
"I wish the three shortlisted sports the best of luck in the run-up to the vote in September and would like to thank the other sports for their hard work and dedication."

Manchester United rescued by 'special' teen Adnan Junuzaj
updated 4:42 PM EDT, Sat October 5, 2013
Adnan Januzaj volleys Manchester United's winner against Sunderland in the 18-year-old's first Premier League start. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Adnan Januzaj helps Manchester United come from behind at Sunderland
Teenager scores both goals in first EPL start, which ends in a 2-1 victory
Champion United six points behind leader Liverpool, which also wins
Manchester City rebounds from two defeats with 3-1 victory over Everton
(CNN) -- English football seems to be experiencing something of a time warp. Liverpool and Arsenal jostling for top spot, Manchester United languishing in mid-table.
For 55 minutes of United's match at bottom club Sunderland on Saturday, it appeared that the English Premier League champion's worst start to a season in 24 years would continue.
Before kickoff, Liverpool had welcomed back 1990's title-winning manager Kenny Dalglish to a non-executive board role by beating Crystal Palace 3-1 to regain first place -- at least until Arsenal's trip to West Brom on Sunday.
Sunderland, still without a permanent manager to replace the sacked Paolo Di Canio, then took a shock fifth-minute lead as Craig Gardner capitalized on some inept United defending, with Nemanja Vidic inexplicably giving him the ball inside the penalty area.

For new United manager David Moyes, it raised the prospect of a third successive league defeat -- which last happened to the Red Devils 12 years ago.
But much like his predecessor Alex Ferguson's success in introducing young talent such as David Beckham in the 1990s, Moyes was rescued by an 18-year-old making his first EPL start.
Adnan Januzaj, yet another Belgian starlet to make his mark in England's top flight, first leveled with a cool sidefoot effort 10 minutes after halftime as he burst into the box to collect Patrice Evra's low cross.
The midfielder, born in Brussels to Kosovar-Albanian parents and who has thus far refused all Belgium international call-ups, then volleyed a sublime left-footed winner just after the hour mark.
For Moyes, who gave United striker Wayne Rooney his debut when a 16-year-old at Everton, Januzaj has every chance of joining the club's long line of top stars.
"I remember giving Wayne his debut and Adnan is certainly that quality. He's a top, top player," the Scot said after the match.

"I would have played him two or three weeks ago but it didn't work. We just never quite got the opportunity for different reasons, and I thought today was the right time and it was hard to stop him.
"He's going to be a special talent and he showed he's got goals and ability. We will keep his feet on the ground."
The result left United in ninth place, six points behind the club's bitter rival Liverpool.
For the Anfield Reds, this is the team's best start to a season since the advent of the EPL in 1992, with five wins from seven games.
Dalglish's second stint as manager -- his first was the last time Liverpool won the title -- ended with the sack 17 months ago in the wake of mixed results and Luis Suarez's eight-match ban for racially abusing Evra.

Brendan Rodgers struggled in his first season as the club legend's replacement, not helped by Suarez's 10-match ban for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic.

That suspension spilled over into this season, but the Uruguayan's subsequent return has not hindered Liverpool's impressive start to the campaign -- indeed he has come back with a bang, adding another goal to last weekend's double against Sunderland.
His partnership with Daniel Sturridge continues to blossom, with the young England forward making it 2-0 against Palace with his sixth in the league and eighth overall.
"The two boys up front are as good as any in the league, so you know you're always going to be in with a chance with them two," Rodgers said.
Veteran Steve Gerrard celebrated his 639th appearance for Liverpool -- putting him seventh on the club's all-time list -- with his 99th EPL goal, netting from the penalty spot before halftime.
Palace boss Ian Holloway was aggrieved by that decision, with Dean Moxey's tug on Raheem Sterling appearing to be on the edge of the area, but had the small consolation of seeing his second-bottom side edge the second half thanks to a late header by record signing Dwight Gayle.
Manchester City bounced back from the midweek Champions League lesson against Bayern Munich by moving up to third place with victory by the same 3-1 scoreline against Everton.
On-loan Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku gave the home fans a sense of déjà vu as he put Everton ahead, with England goalkeeper Joe Hart again in question -- as he had twice been against European champion Bayern.
But Spain striker Alvaro Negredo leveled and Sergio Aguero made it 2-1 on halftime, before the Argentine's 69th-minute penalty hit the post and cruelly bounced into the net off the head of goalkeeper Tim Howard.
Aston Villa beat City last weekend, but this time could only draw 0-0 at promoted Hull in a result that left both sides comfortably mid-table.
Fulham moved out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at Stoke thanks to a second-half goal from former Villa striker Darren Bent, who came on to replace the injured Dimitar Berbatov.
Newcastle joined Villa and Manchester United on 10 points after winning 2-1 at promoted Cardiff, with both goals from on-loan French striker Loic Remy.
