(CNN) -- Dylan Lauren is a self-proclaimed kid in a candy shop. Luckily for her, she owns it.Three years ago Lauren fused her love of art and passion for candy into "Dylan's Candy Bar." The 10,000-square-foot New York City flagship store houses thousands of candy products. The store also hosts parties, all in a seemingly edible environment.The mega sugar shop welcomes candy-lovers of all ages, not just youngsters looking for their sugar fix. Lauren says she's found a healthy market for candy lovers in preschool, in college, even in retirement homes.To prove her point, she recalls one special birthday party for an 80-year-old man, whose friends flocked to the store. In another case, a woman proposed marriage to her candy-loving man inside the shop."It's really for the kid in anyone, or a person who has a sweet tooth," she says. "And I've tried to give it that sexy, adult spin."Good for all agesOf course, candy is the store's star -- including hard-to-find classic candies and treats acquired from hundreds of vendors. But the sweet setting also plays a big part in the experience.Tunes like "Brown Sugar" and "Lollipop" constantly play in the background, while vintage candy commercials take adults back to their favorite treats as kids.The store itself functions as a self-contained edible world. The caf�, which offers over 300 flavors of ice cream, seats customers on peppermint stools and at tables made of real gumballs. There, customers can savor everything from hot chocolate to candy martini until 10 p.m.Candy cane columns, an oversized lollipop tree, and stairs made of real sweets make up the rest of the store fixtures.Lauren, a candy-lover since childhood, recognizes the aesthetics of her sugary industry."[I] think a lot of people are obsessed with candy, but it's a side thing," she says. "They all grow up loving candy, but it was a food fixation. For me, it's about the art of it. I look at a gummy bear, I hold it up to the light, and I just think it's a beautiful."Creating a culture of candyCreativity is in the family blood. Her father is famed fashion designer Ralph Lauren. Her mother does photography and watercolor painting.An art history major at Duke University, Lauren says this background translates neatly to her current vocation -- be it in the store's look or individual candy's wrapping."I wanted to add that twist to candy, so when I look at candy, I say, 'That's cool packaging. What can I do to make it more of a gift item rather than consumption?'" she says."I felt like there was something about that I could do something with it to add a spin to it."Citing her father's example, Lauren says she hopes to extend the candy concept beyond the culinary world."I think my dad has done a great job of building a lifestyle out of clothing, and making people see a polo shirt is more than just a shirt, [by combining it] into culture or a way of living. And we're trying to build that with candy."One way she tries to do that at Dylan's Candy Bar is by offering non-edible products.Patrons can browse a selection of candy store apparel and accessories, from baby Tootsie Roll T-shirts to Dylan's Candy Bar-branded tote bags. Candy scented candles, perfumes and dishware are also offered.Body shake products and vanilla bath sugar are two of a few efforts to import that candy culture into the bathtub."We are expanding it into our own Dylan's Candy Bar spa line," Lauren says. "One of the concepts of the store is for everything to look edible, but also be a fun gift."With stores in Houston, Texas; Orlando, Florida; and Garden City, New York, she hopes to expand to other cosmopolitan areas and transport her patrons to her "world of candy.""Our average customer stays for a good 45 minutes, just looking at all the designs, and sort of overwhelmed," Lauren says."When they're in Dylan's Candy Bar, they're in a whole world of candy, and that's where I want to keep them."

Son: Joe Paterno has lung cancer
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 5:31 PM EST, Fri November 18, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Treatment options include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy
Joe Paterno has developed a treatable form of lung cancer, his son says
Paterno is the winningest coach in Division I college football history Paterno has said he wished he had done more after hearing sex abuse allegation
(CNN) -- Joe Paterno, the Penn State football coach who lost his job amid allegations of child sex abuse against his former defensive coordinator, has a treatable form of lung cancer, his son said Friday.
The family learned of the diagnosis after Paterno's follow-up visit last weekend for a bronchial illness, Scott Paterno said.
"He is currently undergoing treatment, and his doctors are optimistic that he will make a full recovery," Scott Paterno said in a statement. "As everyone can appreciate, this is a deeply personal matter for my parents, and we simply ask that his privacy be respected as he proceeds with treatment."
Paterno, 84, the all-time winningest football coach in Division I history, was fired last week amid the outcry over the handling of the abuse claims.
Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said.
"It is such a difficult, difficult cancer to beat," she said. "Often, it is found pretty late."
Cohen said that catching the disease early is crucial to improving chances for survival. White men who discover their lung cancer early have a 50-50 chance of being alive five years later. If they catch it late, they have a 4% chance of being alive five years later, Cohen said.
If Paterno is a candidate for surgery, Cohen told "The Situation Room," he may lose at least 20% of his lungs.
Paterno, who served 46 years as head coach in State College, was known to generations of football fans simply as JoePa.
National outrage percolated over Paterno's reaction to a graduate assistant's 2002 report that he had seen former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky performing anal sex on a young boy in the shower room of the football complex.
Paterno said that he'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report about sex abuse allegations but that he nevertheless passed the allegations on to his boss. He said he had done "what I was supposed to do." In a later statement, he said "with the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more."
It was years before law enforcement learned about the allegation.
Friday's announcement coincides with news of an NCAA investigation at Penn State.
"This unprecedented situation demands the NCAA evaluate the university's accountability" and application of NCAA bylaws, NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a letter to the school.
CNN contributor Sara Ganim reported from Pennsylvania.

Record highs broken in slew of cities By the CNN Wire Staff 'Flirting' with 100 degreesSTORY HIGHLIGHTS"We have AC. Who cares what's playing," says a Minneapolis theater marqueeIn New York, possible fines for stores that leave doors openAir conditioner repair experts' business boomsBrookfield Zoo in Illinois gives some animals big blocks of ice filled with foodRead local weather stories from CNN affiliates WRTV in Indianapolis, KCTV in Kansas City, WXYZ in Detroit and WLFI in West Lafayette, Indiana. (CNN) -- The blistering heat wave that has brought stifling conditions to much of the United States broke 55 record highs on Wednesday, the National Weather Service said Thursday. That's more than 1% of all temperature records in the country. Another 60 records were tied Wednesday, the weather service said. As many as 22 deaths are blamed on the heat, the service said. Excessive heat and humidity are "expected to expand into the Ohio Valley and East Coast states for the remainder of the week," the weather service said in its forecast Thursday. The highest heat index values -- how hot it feels -- "are expected across parts of the Midwest, Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic, where they are forecast to be between 105 and 115 degrees through Friday, with locally higher values possible," the forecast said. How hot is it where you live? Share your photos, videos and stories "Excessive heat watches, warnings and heat advisories are in effect over much of the central U.S., Ohio Valley and from the Carolinas northward into New England." Triple-digit temperatures are forecast to remain across the Eastern United States through Saturday before cooling off slightly to the mid-90s by Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.

But for some places, relief was already in store Thursday. "The extremely hot temperatures should begin to subside across portions of the northern plains today," the National Weather Service said, "but the intense heat will remain in place through the weekend across the central and southern plains." Among the records broken Wednesday were temperatures in Walsh, Colorado, at 104; Garden City, Kansas, at 108; and Gage, Oklahoma, at 107, according to preliminary reports. Heat drives up emergency calls The heat has affected many outdoor activities, prompting one Minneapolis movie theater marquee to read, "We have AC. Who cares what's playing," and one Canadian couple to forgo their original plans while visiting the Twin Cities. Scott Hoffot and his wife, Colleen, of Saskatchewan, Canada, arrived in Minneapolis Sunday with their camping gear, planning for a vacation spent mostly outdoors at a campground. Instead they're now doing "more touristy" things. Tourists Scott Hoffot and his wife, Colleen, are doing "more touristy" things to beat the heat while in Minneapolis. "We went from camping in a tent to staying in hotels, so that we could get air conditioning," said Hoffot. "We spent a fair amount of time in the Mall of America yesterday because of the heat." What's behind deadly heatwave? The last time Isabella Kulkarni of Minneapolis felt this hot, she wasn't even on the same continent. "I was in India, to be honest," Kulkarni said Thursday. "I just have never really experienced this intense humidity. ... You go outside and it's just oppressive. Breathing in (takes) energy." Kulkarni started a new job selling natural ice cream for Pick-a-Pelata, a street-vending ice cream company, around Lake Calhoun in Minneapolis. She rides a bike, with the ice cream in a cooler, around one of the biggest and busiest lakes inside the city. Isabella Kulkarni, a Minneapolis ice cream street vendor, said the last time she felt this hot was when she visited India. One of Kulkarni's first days at work it was nearly 95 degrees. "I just went nice and slow," she said. What a heatstroke feels like In Chicago, the excessive heat has left about 7,000 people without power, CNN affiliate WGN-TV reported. ComEd crews worked through the night, but some residents were resorting to extreme measures to find relief. In one neighborhood, residents Thursday ran wires from one home to another. RELATED TOPICS

In Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Cory Booker announced that facilities were available in every ward to help keep citizens cool. "It is imperative that our residents drink plenty of fluids, stay indoors in a cool climate, and avoid strenuous activity," Booker said in a statement. "I urge our senior citizens and Newark residents who lack air conditioning to come to one of our cooling centers." Why you can't sleep when it's hot In New York, Con Edison called on customers to stay cool and not waste energy. "Store owners who leave doors open with the A/C running could be subject to fines from the city," ConEd said. Air conditioner repair experts with Logan AC & Heating in Cincinnati, Ohio, have been working around the clock. "This is our time of year. The heat wave has been very good for business," said Amanda Kinsella, director the company's sales and marketing division. "Our lines have been flooded with calls for service." The heat index in the Cincinnati area was expected to reach as high as 115 Thursday. The first confirmed heat-related death in Kansas City was declared Thursday, but it stemmed from a death last month. A 57-year-old man was found dead in his home on June 5, according to Dan Ferguson, who works for Jackson County. In addition to the man's death, there are 13 other possible heat-related deaths in Missouri -- the youngest was a woman in her mid-30s, and the oldest were two women in their mid-70s, said Jeff Hershberger, spokesman for the Kansas City Health Department. Heat hurts your insides too It may take six weeks to several months for officials to process toxicology tests to determine whether all 13 died of heat-related causes, Hershberger said. In Wisconsin, a 65-year-old man from Fountain Prairie was confirmed by health officials to have died from heat-related causes Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WKOW. Columbia County Medical Examiner Angela Hinze said the man had underlying medical conditions that were made worse when he was helping a family member outside with housework. In Oklahoma, four heat-related deaths have been confirmed since May, said Cherokee Ballard, a spokeswoman for the state medical examiner. Three of those occurred in the past 30 days, including a 3-year-old boy in a car in Norman and a 69-year-old man from Blackwell, she said. Beat-the-heat advice from a pro An additional eight Oklahoma deaths may potentially be related to the heat, she said, with most occurring in July. CNN affiliate WPXI reported Thursday that a child accidentally locked in a hot car was rescued in Spring Hill, Pennsylvania. The girl's mother locked her keys in the car and immediately called for help, the report said. The girl was not hurt. The high heat continues to take a toll on animals. Dozens of cattle died south of Harmony, Minnesota, CNN affiliate KTTC reported. And on a cattle farm just across the border in northern Iowa, an estimated 100 cattle died, the report said. At the Brookfield Zoo just outside Chicago, staff kept water misters in exhibits and gave some animals huge blocks of ice filled with meat and fruit.CNN's Chris Welch, Sean Morris, Jacqui Jeras, Dave Alsup, Phil Gast and Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.

President Sebastian Pinera: I want a First World Chile by 2020
By Claire Brennan, for CNN
updated 9:27 AM EDT, Mon October 15, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Pinera outlines plans to boost Chilean economy despite global downturn
President wants Chile to be part of the 'First World' by 2020
Free-trade agreements are the key to boosting Chilean industries Editor's note: Business Traveller is a monthly show about making the most of doing business on the road.
(CNN) -- Sebastián Piñera is a man on a mission. The Chilean President wants to transform his homeland into a developed nation by 2020.
It's a big challenge to undertake during a decade that's already been marred by recession and global economic uncertainty. Yet Mr Piñera seems confident.
"We have invested so much that I hope that the next two years will be a time of harvest," he told CNN's Richard Quest.
"We will be able to show to the Chilean people that Chile's a country which is absolutely able to defeat poverty, to overcome underdevelopment, and to join the First World."
So how does the President intend to turn his plans into a reality?
Chile already has a very pro-business environment, but Piñera wants to open the doors of trade to his country even wider.
As one of Chile's richest men, he is no stranger to business and according to Forbes has amassed a fortune of $2.4 billion. He believes his entrepreneurial background leaves him ideally placed to send out a message to the world: Chile is open for business.
"We have realised that we have to be integrated to the world," he said.
We have to compete with the world. And that is why we have free-trade agreementsSebastian Pinera
"We have to compete with the world. And that is why we have free-trade agreements, with the US, with Europe, with China, with India, with Japan, with Korea - you name it.
"I think that's the right path for Chile to become a developed country."
Pinera: U.S. 'printing money' will not solve economic problems
One of the key factors in Piñera's plan to invigorate the Chilean economy is a move towards digital and knowledge based industries.
The country's Start-Up Chile initiative began in 2010, and offers high potential global start-ups a $40,000 investment. No equity is ceded and the only requirement is that one member of the team live in Chile for six months. By the end of its first phase in 2014 it will have provided grants to 1,000 companies for a total of $40 million.
Its critics claim the project throws money away and doesn't produce any long-term benefits. However, Piñera claims most companies stay long after the initial six month period, creating jobs, mixing with local entrepreneurs and sharing ideas.
"We're importing and bringing to Chile people that have good ideas, entrepreneurship capacity and the ability to start a business here," said Piñera.
Chilean president focuses on education
"What they will teach to our people is very, very valuable. To have a stable economy, to have a stable democracy, and to have a modern government is not enough. We have to build new pillars of development. Education, science and technology, innovation and entrepreneurship, and more equality."
Of course, Chile's future isn't simply reliant on establishing a sustainable domestic economic policy. It's also dependent on exterior influences, and like all free-trade economies it has plenty to worry about.
The problems in the eurozone, the fiscal cliff in the United States, and the slowdown in China all loom in the air above the presidential headquarters of La Monda Palace.
Yet Piñera remains defiant. He said: "I am very convinced that in these next two years, we will be able - even though the world will be in the middle of a crisis - to keep moving forward. At good pace, and with very good direction."
We're importing and bringing to Chile people that have good ideas, entrepreneurship capacity and the ability to start a business hereSebastián Piñera, president of Chile
As a nation Chile is viewed as one of the most stable and secure countries in South America. It's rich in mineral resources, has low fiscal debt and political stability, and in 2011 its exports grew by 17%.
Piñera attributes Chile's integration into global markets to its free trade agreements and believes continuing on that path will propel the country to economic stability in spite of negative global factors.
He said: "We decided to integrate our country with the world. That is why we are part of the APEC, we have a free-trade agreement with the European Community, we will be part of the Trans Pacific Partnership, we are part of the Pacific Alliance. That's key aspects. If you try to only base your development in your local market, that's not enough.
However Piñera knows the hardwork also need to come from Chielans themselves. "You need to trust your people. And for that you need to improve the quality of education. The quality of training and motivate people to do their best," he said.

How Aaron Swartz helped build the Internet
By Todd Leopold, CNN
updated 9:53 AM EST, Tue January 15, 2013 | Filed under: Web
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Aaron Swartz, young Internet innovator, committed suicide Friday Swartz helped create RSS, founded company that later merged with Reddit
Analyst: Swartz's biggest impact may have been his activism for Web openness
"We lost a really important person," Christopher Soghoian says
(CNN) -- Aaron Swartz helped create the Internet.
Maybe not the Internet foundations of ARPANET and TCP/IP and Mosaic, the codes and packets and standards on which the whole thing is based. But he was a factor in fashioning some of the Web's upper floors. With his contributions to RSS coding and the Web application framework, Swartz made some of today's more expansive Internet possible.
But what Swartz also helped create was a philosophy of the Internet, one that remains the subject of great controversy almost 20 years into its life: the libertarian idea that information wants to be free.
"Aaron was a genius," said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist and a senior policy analyst at the ACLU. "He was a technologist who was committed to open access to information, and committed to bringing about the changes he believed in."
"Aaron was an embodiment of the Web, and a contributor to many of the aspects that made it great," said Matt Mullenweg, who founded the blogging platform WordPress, in a statement. "When I was young and getting into technology Aaron was even younger and literally setting the standards for the Web with contributions to RSS 1.0 and Creative Commons. He inspired a generation to share online, to move to (San Francisco), to not be afraid to start things, and to break down barriers."
Swartz's friend: Government bullied him
Swartz died Friday of an apparent suicide in his apartment in Brooklyn, New York. He was 26.
Although Swartz's life was not without controversy -- he faced federal charges that he illegally downloaded millions of scholarly papers from MIT -- his death has been met with an outpouring of tributes and grief.
A Tumblr page was set up for people to express their thoughts and condolences. Friends and commenters there described him as "inspiring," "enthusiastic," "a hero," "shy," "a great technologist" -- a bright, inquisitive, creative, challenging personality who deeply affected those he touched.
Opinion: Why the Net grieves Aaron Swartz
"Such a brilliant, disciplined, well-spoken guy with a great sense of humor, who probably knew as much about 'Star Wars' mythology and trivia as he did about programming computers," wrote a member of Chicago Force, a "Star Wars" fan club, noting the shock of club members in 1999 when they met with the budding Web developer and discovered he was just 12 years old.
"Let his life be an inspiration to us all to keep fighting, to keep building a better world, where free expression and open standards become the norm for everyone," added Jan Zuppinger, who described himself as an "Internet Freedom Activist."
"World wanderers, we have lost a wise elder. Hackers for right, we are one down," said World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee in a tweet.
'I want something new, something worthwhile, something better'
Swartz was apparently committed to such activism from an early age. He was born in Chicago, the son of a software company founder, and showed both intellect and restlessness at an early age.
"My name is Aaron Swartz," he wrote on a blog when he was a teenager, according to an entry on the Tumblr. (The actual blog post appears to be unavailable.) "I'm a 9th grader at the North Shore Country Day School. In the summer of 2000, I finally realized that school wasn't working. I decided to do something about it. ... I'm tired of outdated teaching practices where the students don't learn anything. I'm tired of constantly being prepared for more preparation. I want something new, something worthwhile, something better."
He would have been 13 at the time.
Swartz never really gravitated to old-fashioned schooling; after his blog note, he mainly studied at home. He enrolled at Stanford in 2004 but only stayed a year, saying he didn't find "a very intellectual atmosphere" on the campus at the edge of Silicon Valley. He later became a fellow at Harvard University's Ethics Center Lab on Institutional Corruption.
Swartz was a prodigy. By the time he was 14, he had co-written the specification for RSS -- originally Rich Site Summary, now Really Simple Syndication -- a Web-publishing technology for delivering syndicated content from frequently updated sites, such as blogs or news websites. RSS allows Web consumers to receive the latest stories on a feed without having to constantly revisit their favorite pages.
If you subscribe to a podcast -- or receive automatic updates from CNN.com -- you have Swartz to thank.
After leaving Stanford he created Infogami, which was later merged with Reddit, the freewheeling social-news site where users vote their favorite stories onto the main page. Reddit, which was purchased by Conde Nast in 2006, has come under fire for its anything-goes ethos. One popular Reddit moderator, who went by the name Violentacrez, was known for starting Reddit pages devoted to underage girls and violent fantasies. When his identity became known via a Gawker article, he was fired from his job.
Swartz was long gone from Reddit by then -- he was let go just after the Conde Nast purchase -- but believed in the ethos of the site and the open Internet in general.
"(He) engineered his own dismissal and got cashed out, and then became a full-time, uncompromising, reckless and delightful s***-disturber," wrote BoingBoing's Cory Doctorow, a friend of Swartz's, in a tribute.
One of Swartz's desires was to make public information truly public -- that is, free and easily available.
There's a government-run system, PACER, that allows the public to access court records online. However, PACER charged a fee for accessing this public-domain information. As Doctorow observed, Swartz "singlehandedly liberated 20% of U.S. law" by moving the information onto a public site, spending "a small fortune" of his own money doing so.
Later, Swartz founded Demand Progress, a group devoted to Internet activism. For all his success with programming, it's in this arena that he had the most impact, said Soghoian. Demand Progress was instrumental in fighting the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect IP Act, two bills that would have expanded government oversight in fighting Internet piracy and copyright violations at the possible expense of the free flow of information.
"He really, really believed that public information should be free and accessible to everyone," said Soghoian.
Suicide sparks talk about depression
'This was not serious computer hacking'
By the time SOPA and PIPA were shot down last year, Swartz had become entangled in another legal thicket surrounding free access to online data.
According to federal prosecutors, Swartz used MIT's computer networks to download more than 4 million articles from JSTOR, a digital library of academic journals, in 2010 and 2011. He was charged with wire fraud, computer fraud and other crimes, even though JSTOR declined to prosecute and urged the government to drop the case.
"What Aaron was accused of by the government (was) essentially a serious form of computer hacking," said Soghoian. If found guilty, Swartz could have been sentenced to up to 35 years in jail and a $1 million fine.
Soghoian was one of many observers surprised at the severity of the charges.
"These are the kinds of things you'd assume the government would use in a serious hacking case -- identity theft, millions of credit card numbers stolen, hacking into protected government databases or corporate networks," he said. "Aaron was accused of downloading too many articles from a website that anyone connected to the MIT network could log into.
"This was not serious computer hacking and the government didn't appear to differentiate between those kinds of activities."
Prosecutors saw it differently. When Swartz was indicted in July 2011, U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz said, "Stealing is stealing whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data or dollars. It is equally harmful to the victim whether you sell what you have stolen or give it away."
In the wake of Swartz's death, critics have been quick to cast blame. Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, an outspoken writer on Internet issues, titled a blog post "Prosecutor as bully."
"From the beginning the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way," he wrote. "Somehow, we need to get beyond the 'I'm right so I'm right to nuke you' ethics that dominates our time. That begins with one word: Shame."
Swartz's family was equally pointed.
"Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's office and at MIT contributed to his death," they said in a statement.
Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment to CNN on Swartz's case, citing respect for his family.
Soghoian, the ACLU's analyst, said he sees Swartz's death as a great loss. Swartz could have made a fortune as a start-up wizard or venture capitalist but instead he plowed what money he made into his activism, he said.
"Aaron is seen as a hero. He spent a lot of time working to make the Internet a more open place," Soghoian said. "We lost a really important person who changed the Internet in a positive way, and we all lose out by his departure."

'Dancing' contestant Valerie Harper hopes you dance, too
By Lisa Respers France, CNN
updated 6:03 PM EDT, Wed September 4, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Valerie Harper announced in March she has terminal cancer
The former "Rhoda" star says she is responding well to treatment
Actress says she hopes to encourage others by joining "Dancing With the Stars"
(CNN) -- Fans of "Dancing With the Stars" know how grueling the competition can be.
Contestants practice for hours a day, and almost every season some celebs are brought low by injury. So how in the world will Valerie Harper, who just months ago announced that she had a terminal form of cancer, go for that mirror ball trophy?
Apparently with the same spirit that caused the "Rhoda" actress to offer this up for fans:
"I hope you dance! I hope you dance," Harper told CNN on Wednesday. " And that's what I'm saying to everybody, that's just my message. Dance."
Valerie Harper: 'We're all terminal'
Harper's moments: Marriage, motherhood
Explaining Harper's 'incurable' cancer
'DWTS' thinks big for 17th season cast
Harper announced in March that she had been diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a condition in which cancer cells spread into the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. But Harper told CNN that she does not have brain cancer.
"I have lung cancer," she said. "It is situated in the lining of the brain; it's not even in the brain."
Her husband, Tony Cacciotti, encouraged her to sign on with the hit ABC dance competition, she said. He runs the couple's production company and had been considering her participation for a few years.
The actress said she initially resisted the idea.
"I said, 'Give me one good reason,' " Harper recalled. "He said, 'You have cancer! Get up there, and show people that you can dance and do -- and the doctors said it's fine to exercise. Encourage people to move, to exercise, to do all the things that will be good for them, and mainly not to sit in the house and glower and worry and feel sorry for yourself because you have this disease and anything else.'"
Exercise is generally encouraged for patients, according to the American Cancer Society.
"At one time, patients with cancer, especially in the advanced stages, were often told by their doctor to rest and limit their exercise," the organization's website says. "But newer research has shown that exercise is not only safe and possible during cancer treatment, but that it also can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life."
Actress Valerie Harper lives in the moment after cancer diagnosis Harper, 74, said she has been responding well to treatment, though she disputed reports she is in remission. Thinking about death makes everyone fearful, she said, "and we gloss it over; we pretend it's not happening, that it's over there."
"This death sentence made me look it in the eye, and then once you do it, it's a great freedom," she said.
The show's host, Tom Bergeron, said Harper is in great spirits, even joking with him that "Hey, I'm past my expiration date!"
"I think arguably we have some of the (most) poignant story lines of all this season, particularly with Valerie," he said.
Harper's dance partner for the show, Tristan MacManus, said the actress' participation goes beyond her being ill.
"It's not about someone who's sick doing something," he said. "I think it's just about someone who's willing to do something."

Begala says election about "ideas" not "insults"
WASHINGTON (AllPolitics, October 30) -- White House Senior Advisor Paul Begala tells CNN that the White House believes Tuesday's election will be about "ideas and issues not insults."
Begala criticized Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich saying it is "frankly
shocking that Speaker Gingrich wants to spend all of his time orchestrating
attack ads attacking the president personally."
Begala added that Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York "epitomizes the negative politics" that he believes the voters will reject Tuesday. He said "soon to be elected Senator Schumer", referring to D'Amato's Democratic opponent Rep. Charles Schumer, is focused on the issues and not politics.
Begala said he feels Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer of California will be re-elected based on her record.
