Gingrich: GOP ready to shut government down over drillingStory Highlights Republicans continue protests calling for vote on offshore oil drilling measure Democrats blocked vote on measure before Congress went into recess GOP is considering a government shutdown to force a vote, Gingrich says Democrats say they will not allow government to be shut down Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO By Lisa Desjardins CNN Radio	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- He led Republicans into government shutdowns in the 1990s, and now, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in September. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is drawing attention to a Republican call for offshore oil drilling. House Republicans brought Gingrich to the Capitol on Wednesday, partly to revive media coverage of their speech-making protest in the chamber, now in its fourth day. The rest of Congress is gone for August recess, but several Republican House members have been speaking on the floor of the closed-down chamber, calling for a special session to vote on drilling and energy. Gingrich did attract more camera crews, and he used the opportunity to point to what may be the GOP's next strategy: If Democrats refuse to hold a separate vote on oil drilling, Republicans could try to block the votes needed to keep government running past September 30. Watch Gingrich return to the Capitol » "Are [Democrats] really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling?" Gingrich asked. "Because I think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy." The precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated, but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends September 30 and Congress must vote next month to keep the government operating.

iReport.com: Is drilling the best option?
One of those spending bills, for the Department of the Interior, contains the hot-button provision banning offshore oil drilling on the outer continental shelf. If that bill expires, as it is set to do at the end of September, then so does the drilling ban. Republicans believe a majority of the House opposes the ban, and thus a vote on whether to keep government running could also become a vote on whether to allow offshore drilling. Watch House Republicans demand a vote » The parliamentary possibilities are numerous. But Republican House Leader John Boehner's office thinks the votes are there, on both sides of the Capitol, to support drilling and energy expansion. Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith confirmed there are many options on the table for September, including a shutdown threat. "If Democrats want to block what a majority of the House and Senate want, they can proceed with a strategy that would in effect shut down the government," Smith said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office responded quickly with a statement from spokesman Nadeam Elshami. "Democrats will not shut down the government," he wrote, "but it is not surprising Newt Gingrich would raise that threat since he and the Republican Party shut down the government in the 1990s." Gingrich's political game of chicken with then-President Bill Clinton led to two government shutdowns in late 1995 and early 1996. The moves backfired, and polls showed more Americans blamed Gingrich. But he defends his decisions. "We shut the federal government down, for a brief period, in order to get a balanced budget," he told CNN Radio. "That was a deliberate systematic strategy." Now the strategy seems to be an all-out effort to heap pressure on Pelosi, who opposes offshore oil drilling and has so far not scheduled a vote. iReport.com: Is drilling the best option? Democrats call the floor speeches and photo opportunities a "hoax." House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer sent out a statement saying, "Republicans are doing nothing but pushing the failed Johnny-one-note policies of the past." But Republicans keep adding pressure. After three days of speaking under shadows in the unlit House chamber, the GOP congressmen found themselves facing six television cameras and at least three dozen reporters when Gingrich joined them Wednesday. The equivalent news conference Tuesday morning attracted a single camera and approximately 10 journalists. Republican Conference Chairman Adam Putnam would not say how long he and his GOP mates will hold the floor. But there is a clear sense of political momentum, as well as a lot of rah-rah, among Republicans rotating in and out of the chamber. "The energy level is high," Putnam said, "and I think we've got a lot of energy left in us, don't we?" About 15 Republicans behind him cheered. Gingrich pushed a broader view. "I think the energy level has shifted between the two parties in the last couple weeks," he said, "and my hunch is there are a lot of Democrats back home who are tap dancing."

Vitamin E may protect lungsBy Carina Storrs, Health.com Experts believe vitamins A, C, and E combat oxidative stress in the lungs that can lead to COPD. STORY HIGHLIGHTSVittamin E can cut chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk in smokers and nonsmokersCOPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis; often, but not always, caused by smokingSeveral studies have shown that vitamins A, C, E and D may help improve lung health
RELATED TOPICS

Smoking and Tobacco Use
Vitamins and Supplements
(Health.com) -- People who take vitamin E supplements regularly for years -- whether they are smokers or nonsmokers -- may lower their risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the lung condition that is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. COPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is often, but not always, caused by smoking. While the risk reduction is relatively small, 10 percent, COPD is a common and life-threatening condition in which a decline in lung function can be slowed down but not reversed. COPD symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing, and fatigue. "The effect appears to be modest. But for something for which there isn't really any effective therapy and tends to be a degenerative condition, anything that would reduce the risk even somewhat is not an insubstantial benefit," says Jeffrey B. Blumberg, Ph.D., a professor of nutrition at Tufts University in Boston who was not involved in the study. The research, from the government-funded Women's Health Study, included 39,876 women 45 years and older who were free of COPD before they were randomly assigned to take a placebo, vitamin E supplements (600 IU every other day) or aspirin (100 mg per day), either alone or in combination. At the end of 10 years, 760 of the 19,937 women who took vitamin E alone or with aspirin developed COPD compared with 846 of the 19,939 who took a placebo or aspirin alone -- a 10 percent risk reduction. Vitamin E did not lower the risk of asthma, a condition associated with a higher risk of COPD. Health.com: 10 ways to have cleaner air at home The researchers took into account factors such as cigarette smoking and age, which can affect COPD risk. The study, conducted by Cornell University and Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers, is to be presented this week at the annual American Thoracic Society meeting in New Orleans. The idea that vitamin E can reduce the risk of developing COPD is "biologically plausible," says Yvonne Kelly, Ph.D., an associate professor in the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London. Experts believe vitamins A, C, and E -- the so-called ACE antioxidants -- combat oxidative stress in the lungs that can lead to COPD. Health.com: Eight causes of a chronic cough Several studies have shown that these vitamins, as well as vitamin D, may help improve lung health. In a 2003 study, Kelly and her collaborators found that men and women with diets high in vitamins C and E had greater lung capacity and produced less phlegm, respectively. Phlegm production and wheezing are also COPD symptoms. One limitation of the study is that the researchers relied on the women to report whether or not they had a diagnosis of COPD, says Michael Sims, M.D., an assistant professor in the pulmonary critical care division at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. He points out that people with asthma may think they have COPD, or vice versa, since the symptoms are similar. In addition, early diagnoses can be inconclusive or due to lung problems that don't turn out to be COPD. Health.com: How to buy the right air cleaner In future studies, Sims says that the researchers should diagnose COPD using a breathing test called spirometry. "If you showed in a similar study with a gold standard outcome [like spirometry], among smokers and nonsmokers, that you could affect the incidence of COPD, I would imagine the committees that meet on this would take a serious look at increasing daily recommended intake [of vitamin E] for the general population," he says. Currently, no vitamin supplements are recommended to prevent or treat COPD. The best way to prevent the disease is to quit smoking, says Dr. Sims. About 24 million people in the U.S. have COPD -- 12 million who've been diagnosed with the disease and another 12 million who have COPD but don't know they have it. In the study, women who smoked were four times more likely than nonsmokers to develop COPD. Health.com:12 best COPD blogs and Web sites The daily recommended intake of vitamin E is about 22 international units for those 14 and older, and is relatively easy to obtain from oils such as sunflower, almonds, peanut butter, and spinach. The vitamin E intake in the study was far higher, at 300 IU per day. However, Blumberg says this is within the range of most over-the-counter vitamin supplements, which deliver 100 or 400 IU daily. "This study is still five times below the highest dose at which no adverse effect has been found," he says. Vitamin E intake is generally a concern only at very high doses, above 1500 IU per day. Several studies have suggested that these levels promote hemorrhaging and interfere with normal blood clotting. For this reason, high doses of vitamin E are not recommended for people taking blood-thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin) and aspirin. Health.com: Eight breathing tips for people with COPD For people concerned about their lung health, taking vitamin E and C is not a bad idea, says Blumberg. "If I were talking to somebody who was a former smoker and who was concerned about minimizing their risk of not only lung disease but also heart disease and cancer, then taking a supplement of C and E would be a reasonable thing to do," he says. In fact, anyone who thought he or she was at increased risk of COPD could potentially benefit from these supplements, he adds. Supplements of beta-carotene, which is a precursor of the antioxidant vitamin A, should be used with caution, however. While a 2006 French study found that people with diets high in beta-carotene had a slower decline in lung function over an eight-year period, heavy smokers and drinkers may not benefit. Two studies found that beta-carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer in people who smoked more than one pack a day and drank heavily. According to Sims, the new study offers an incentive to look closer at the potential to use vitamin E or other antioxidants to help prevent COPD. "If it could be done with something like vitamin E, that's a relatively low-risk intervention, that would be the Holy Grail."Copyright Health Magazine 2011

Somali rapper K'naan makes songs in the key of love
From Isha Sesay and Jessica Elils, CNN
updated 11:51 AM EDT, Tue April 24, 2012
K'naan is a superstar from Somalia and a global hip-hop sensation. Critics have compared him to both Bob Marley and Eminem.
K'naan performs "Wavin' Flag" on June 01, 2010, in Witbank, South Africa. The song was selected as the official anthem of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
U2 singer Bono and K'naan perform at the Clinton Foundation's Decade of Difference concert on October 15, 2011 at the Hollywood Bowl in California.
Strongly influenced by Somalia, K'naan's socially-conscious lyrics stem from his life as a refugee and memories of civil war.
K'naan pictured with rapper Mos Def during the 30th Annual Toronto International Film Festival on September 15, 2005.
The talented artist fuses a wide array of styles and rhythms to deliver his African-influenced rap.
K'naan's latest album -- dubbed "Country, God or the Girl" -- is expected to be released early in May.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
K'naan is a rap star who's achieved fame around the world with his Africa-influenced songs
He escaped war-torn Somalia as a teenager to eventually settle in Canada
K'naan, whose name means 'traveler' learned English by listening to rap records His song "Wavin' Flag" was chosen as the official anthem for the 2010 FIFA World Cup
(CNN) -- His name means "traveler" and Somali-born poet, rapper and musician K'naan has certainly come a long way.
The hip-hop sensation, who's been compared by critics to both reggae hero Bob Marley and rap star Eminem, fled war-torn Somalia as a teenager to eventually settle down with his family in Canada.
Strongly influenced by his native country, his socially conscious lyrics stem from life as a refugee and memories of civil war. Yet, the talented rhymesmith says today that he is more interested in emotional journeys, penning songs about the battles of the heart instead of street ones.
"In some ways, love can be harder than war -- it's a very difficult thing when human beings acknowledge their vulnerability," he says.
K'Naan: Somalia's hip-hop sensation
"War has a way of making life painfully factual and love has a way of making life completely painfully dreamy, and I wanted to try to be honest about where I'm at in life," adds K'naan, whose latest album, "Country, God or the Girl" is expected to be released early next month.

Blessed with an uncanny lyrical gift, K'naan fuses a wide array of styles and rhythms to deliver his African-influenced rap.
K'Naan's journey for poetic justice
In 2010, his upbeat tune "Wavin' Flag" became a global hit after it was chosen as the official Coca-Cola anthem for the 2010 South Africa World Cup, the first time that football's biggest tournament was held on African soil.
For K'naan, the selection of his song was a "surreal" and "magic" moment.
"That perspective is not lost on me, you know that I was someone who was raised and born in that continent," he says. "That moment of the continent's recognition and glory, that my music is the soundtrack for that, is a pretty huge privilege and that something to this day I'm still trying to kind of get a hold of."
With two full length albums already under his belt, his impressive roster of collaborations features a wide array of high-profile names, including rapper Nas and Mos Def, singer Nelly Furtado and Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett.
In his latest offering, he also joins forces with Rolling Stones legend Keith Richards and rapper Will.i.am.
It's a long journey from where K'naan imagined he would be when he and his family boarded one of the last commercial flights to leave Somalia in 1991, at a time when the East African country was descending into chaos, mired in the grip of a long civil war.
"I think I felt quiet a bit of guilt," he recalls. "Leaving was both a privilege and a burden because you saw the people around you who also deserved the chance to leave but weren't going to get that chance and you were getting that chance."
War has a way of making life painfully factual and love has a way of making life completely painfully dreamy.K'naan, rapper

"I picked up rap records because rappers seemed to me like they ... could be great orators, so I would listen to them," he says. "Luckily I did come upon people who were great poets like Naz and Rakim and people who use similes, imagery, metaphors, things that could teach me something."
In the end, he says he learned the new language very quickly "because it was like a survivor's manual -- it wasn't a leisurely activity for me, it was what I needed to live because language is so important in my culture."
K'naan released his first full-length album -- dubbed "Dusty Foot Philosopher" -- in 2005 to critical acclaim. Yet, his first outing to a truly global stage came a few years earlier, in front of a rather unusual audience for hip-hop standards.
A relatively unknown artist, K'naan was invited in early 2000s to perform at a United Nations' event marking the 50th anniversary of the organization's refugee agency.
Standing in front of some of the world's most powerful men, K'naan stopped his performance to recite a politically-charged poem, blasting the U.N. for its failed relief mission in Somalia.
"At this time I said what do I have to do, I have no career, nobody cares, I can't live with myself if I don't say something now that I have the opportunity to address all these people of stature and political clout.
"It was like honest in the moment. It was something that was about what's happened over there and how it was treated how it was ignored, how it was undervalued by leadership and all of that."

The crowd's initial silence quickly gave its place to a standing ovation, prompting Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour to storm up on stage and congratulate him.
Passionate about the country he was born, K'naan says Somalia is a country with an incredible amount of potential.
"If you're ever around Somali people you know how enterprising they can be, how sophisticated and intelligent they can be and you have only circumstances which enhance the negativity of such wealthy people," he says. "So I would say that while all this is happening the truth about it is that Somalia is untapped in its potential. And so, as long as there is potential, there is hope."

Flu 'epidemic ... still on the uptick,' national health official says
By Elizabeth Landau, CNN
updated 9:24 PM EST, Thu January 10, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: New York county has 2,347 flu cases -- this time last year, there were 5 cases
"We are into what would classically be described as a flu epidemic," health official says
Minnesota has 27 flu-related deaths; Oklahoma had 8
Boston mayor declares a public health emergency because of flu
(CNN) -- The flu is spreading fiercely across the United States, with more than 40 states reporting widespread activity in what one of the nation's leading health officials is calling an epidemic.
"If you look at the charts that the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) put out on their website, it clearly has gone above that threshold. So we are into what would classically be described as a flu epidemic," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
"It's still on the uptick," Fauci added.
The season has started earlier, and cases are more severe than last year, health officials say.
The latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention flu advisory report, which covers the week of December 23 to 29, suggests that 41 states have widespread influenza activity, which was an increase of 31 states from the previous week. The CDC will issue an update on the flu situation Friday.
There have so far been 2,257 hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed flu virus, the CDC report said. Among children, there have been 18 deaths reported during this season. Various state agencies also are compiling statistics on flu-related deaths.
This is only about week five in a 12-week flu season, according to Fauci.
"Remember, once it peaks, you still have a considerable amount of time where there is a lot of flu activity, and right now it may have peaked in some places, but for the most part, it has not yet peaked," he said.

Dealing with the flu
In Massachusetts, one of the 29 states that the CDC has identified as having high activity of influenza-like illness, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino declared a public health emergency in the city Wednesday because of the flu.
Since October 1, there have been 700 confirmed influenza cases among Boston residents, according to Menino's office; that's 10 times more than were seen in all of last year's flu season.
There have been 18 flu-related deaths this season in Massachusetts, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Hospitalization rates are higher than the last two years, Kevin Cranston of the state's Bureau of Infectious Diseases told WCVB. Most deaths have been in older patients, he said.
Menino is collaborating with the Boston Public Health Commission and community health centers to offer free vaccination clinics this weekend. The mayor urged residents to stay home from work or school if they are sick, and to get their flu shots.
"This is the worst flu season we've seen since 2009, and people should take the threat of flu seriously," Menino said in a statement. More than 4% of emergency department visits at Boston hospitals are from flu cases, up from 1% during non-flu season.
Massachusetts General Hospital has already counted 532 cases of flu among patients, which is more than the Boston hospital saw in any of the previous three flu seasons, spokeswoman Kristen Stanton said Wednesday.
Signs posted throughout the hospital discourage anyone from visiting who has a cough or fever, she said, and anyone who does visit with those symptoms must wear a mask and perform hand hygiene. All staff must wear a mask when providing care for possible flu cases. Any staff member who has not been vaccinated must wear a mask while caring for any patient.
In Onondaga County, New York, health officials counted 2,347 flu-season cases through last Saturday. In 2011, during the same seasonal time period, they counted five flu cases.
Somerville, Massachusetts, a small city north of Boston, announced that the city's supply of flu vaccine for the season had run out. All 720 doses for the season that were being administered for free had been given out by Tuesday. Residents looking to get vaccinated should contact their primary care physician or local pharmacy, the website said.
That the city's vaccines have all been given out is somewhat surprising because normally there are about 100 doses left over at the end of a season, spokeswoman Jackie Rossetti said Thursday. She attributes this to an earlier start of the flu season and outreach efforts.
Somerville has asked the state's public health department if there are any more available vaccines for the city and is waiting to hear back, she said. Most local pharmacies have doses left, however, she said.
Experts: Flu spreading faster than usual
More cases, deaths in other states
The Oklahoma Department of Health said Thursday the state has had eight influenza-linked deaths since September 30.
Additionally, the Minnesota Department of Health has counted 27 flu-related deaths. "We are clearly at a high level of influenza activity in the state," Minnesota Health Commissioner Dr. Edward Ehlinger said in a statement. "But it's important to keep this year in perspective: What is occurring has happened before."
Pennsylvania has had 22 flu-related deaths so far this season, according to data from the state's Department of Health. Most of these deaths occurred among people older than 65, but the fatalities included two individuals younger than 50 who were otherwise healthy.
Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest in Allentown, Pennsylvania, set up a heated tent outside the hospital to serve as a clinic. Anyone with mild flu symptoms can be treated quickly and discharged, isolated from more serious cases. The hospital has been seeing an additional 80 to 100 patients with flu-like symptoms daily, officials told CNN affiliate WPVI.
Indiana has seen 13 confirmed adult flu-related deaths since November 1, and two pediatric deaths, according to the state's health department.
Arkansas has seven confirmed flu fatalities. Many of the hospitals are at capacity because of the flu or other illnesses, state health spokesman Ed Barham said.
South Carolina has counted 22 flu-related deaths this season, compared with one for all of 2011, according to the South Carolina Department of Health. From September 30 through January 5, the state saw 1,084 influenza-related hospitalizations, the department said.
In Illinois, Department of Public Health Director Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck said Wednesday that since October, six flu-related deaths of patients in intensive-care units have occurred.
"We have been and continue to see an increase in flu activity across the state. The flu strain that is predominately circulating this year is typically more severe, with more hospitalizations and deaths," Hasbrouck said. "From the beginning of October through the end of December we've seen almost 150 people admitted to hospital intensive care units with influenza like illness.
"This compares to last year at this time when there were only two ICU hospitalizations and no deaths."
In Michigan, there have been four pediatric deaths related to the flu, said Angela Minicuci, public information officer for the Michigan Department of Community Health.
And the North Dakota Department of Health is reporting 1,077 cases of flu in the state as of Wednesday -- a sharp increase from the 625 cases reported last week.
Dr. David Zich, internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said this is the worst flu season he's seen in his 12 years at his hospital, in terms of the concentration of patients.
Northwestern Memorial Hospital is on "bypass," which happens when it is beyond capacity because of an influx of patients, such as during flu season.
That means advanced-life support ambulances with patients who are stable are referred to the next closest hospital, no more than five minutes away, Zich said, and transfers are not accepted from outside hospitals. For everyone else, they are open for business.
"The majority of flu patients are sent home, with very little else done, so we can handle that," he said.
FDA approves new type of flu shot
Why so many cases?
Zich theorizes that one reason there are so many flu cases is that the heart of the flu season coincided with the December holiday season, meaning many people were already sleep-deprived from parties and were more likely to get sick.
Those who went to gatherings of family or friends may have already begun to feel sick, and spread the virus to others. People are generally contagious the day before symptoms start, and for five days after becoming sick, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Last flu season was light, but this year has brought with it some "ominous signs," Fauci of the NIH said Tuesday.
Flu cases started going up early, toward the end of November and the beginning of December, he said.
"And it went up on a pretty steep trajectory," he said. "The last time we saw that happen that way was the flu season of 2003 and 2004, which turned out to be a bad flu season."
The type of flu that is going around is called H3N2, which is often linked to more serious disease compared to other flu varieties, Fauci said.
But there's good news: That type of flu matches up well to the vaccine that is being distributed and given out throughout the United States.
People may get more complications from this particular strain of H3N2, "which may make them ill for a longer period of time," Dr. Michael Jhung, medical epidemiologist in the influenza division at CDC, told CNN's Mary Snow.
Best new ways to avoid the cold and flu
"But symptoms typically last up to seven days for a normal infection, a noncomplicated infection with influenza," he said. "And we usually see that from year to year regardless of what strains are circulating."
In a "light" year, a few thousand people may still die, but a particularly serious year could see up to 49,000 deaths from the flu, Fauci said. "There's an average of about 200,000 hospitalizations and there's a lot of economic burdens."
Protect yourself
If you haven't gotten an annual flu vaccine, it's not too late, doctors say. To further protect yourself, try to avoid anyone who is sneezing and coughing, and wash your hands. Also, exercise and eat healthy foods, Zich said.
Most flu patients should not go to an emergency room, Zich said. They will likely be sent home, as there is very little that can be done for them. A fever as high as 103 degrees Fahrenheit is common in the flu.
Patients with normal flu symptoms should get a lot of rest and take painkillers to help with muscle aches, Zich said. "In five to seven days, you're going to be feeling yourself again," he said.
But there are scenarios in which going to a hospital is necessary. If a patient is short of breath, or can't keep fluids down because of nausea, these are signs of a problem that needs immediate attention, as vomiting or sweating from fever can lead to dehydration, Zich said.
Flu can be deadly, even in healthy kids
An otherwise healthy person will not get much benefit from antiviral medications designed to treat symptoms that the flu causes, Zich said. The side effects from both oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) include nausea.
The CDC recommends that people who have a higher risk of complications from the flu receive antiviral treatment. These include people with chronic illnesses such as pulmonary, cardiovascular and neurological conditions, as well as anyone 65 years and older and children under age 2.
What many people don't know is that the flu vaccine becomes less effective as you get older or develop other medical problems, Zich said. The flu shot relies on the body's antibodies against the flu, so if the immune system is already compromised, it will not work as well.

Inaugural gown is the main attraction

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Speculation is swirling over what the first lady will wear to the inaugural ball
Michelle Obama: A gown choice "tells us something much more about each single first lady"
Gowns of the 11 most recent first ladies are on display at the Smithsonian
(CNN) -- As Inauguration Day approaches, the question on everyone's lips is: What will the first lady be wearing?
Glitz, gowns and government bigwigs will all be on display at Monday's parade of inaugural pomp and circumstance.
President Barack Obama will be ceremonially sworn into his second term in office by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts around midday. After the daytime events, which will include the inaugural address and parade, the president and first lady Michelle Obama will end their night by taking to the dance floor at two inaugural balls.
While the formal events bring out their fair share of celebrities, media mavens, and the just-darn-lucky citizens who scored tickets online, there will be only one belle of the ball: The first lady.
First lady reveals new look
Lessons in style from Michelle Obama
Behold one of the most prized traditions of the inaugural season: the wait for the dress. The hype around the inaugural ball gown is the closest thing this side of the pond to a royal wedding gown, and it's approached with the same gusto.
"There has always been an interest in what the first lady is wearing. Photographs and descriptions of the inaugural gown and who designed it have been news for decades," said Lisa Kathleen Graddy, the curator of The Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection at the National Museum of American History.
"Sometimes sketches and descriptions of the dress and even formal photographs of the incoming first lady wearing the dress were released in advance to newspapers," she said.
After all, it is typically the country's collective first impression of the first lady.

Mr. President, who are you wearing?
Monday evening, the president and first lady will attend the Commander in Chief's Ball, which honors service members and their families, a tradition started by former President George W. Bush; and at the Inaugural Ball, the president and first lady will celebrate with people around the country who bought tickets to attend.
At the 2009 inaugural balls, Michelle Obama donned a white chiffon, one-shoulder dress created by Jason Wu, a then up-and-coming, 26-year-old Taiwanese-born designer. She didn't reveal who or what she would be wearing until she stepped out that night. Wu's name is now mentioned in the same breath as heavy-hitting designers like Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Hererra, Marc Jacobs and Diane Von Furstenberg.

That now-iconic gown is part of "A First Lady's Debut," a collection on display at The Smithsonian.
Included in the display are the gowns worn by the 11 most recent first ladies, beginning with Mamie Eisenhower. The museum also houses The First Ladies Collection, which displays clothing worn by earlier White House residents.
"When we look at the gown that Jackie Kennedy wore 50 years ago, or the one that Mary Todd Lincoln wore more than a hundred years before that, it really takes us beyond the history books and the photographs, and it helps us understand that history is really made by real live people," said the current first lady at the unveiling of her gown in March 2010.
She continued: "The detail of each gown -- the fabric, the cut, the color -- tells us something much more about each single first lady. It's a visual reminder that we each come from such different backgrounds, from different generations, and from different walks of life."
Graddy said Mamie Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan in particular captured the look and feel of their eras -- the early '50s, '60s and '80s, respectively.
Mamie Eisenhower's iconic inaugural ball gown was designed by Jewish-American fashion designer Nettie Rosenstein, who championed ready-to-wear fashion and is credited by many with popularizing the "little black dress." It was a sparkling pink creation, made with 2,000 rhinestones. "First Lady Pink" soon became a popular color choice for ladies of the decade.
While Eisenhower was quintessential 1950s, Jacqueline Kennedy went signature '60s with a gown by Ethel Frankau of Bergdorf Custom Salon.
Frankau, who based the gown on descriptions and consultations with Mrs. Kennedy, created a slim, straight silhouette. A chiffon overlay covered an encrusted, off-white strapless bodice (wearing strapless couture without some sort of covering was considered risqué at the time).
Meanwhile, Nancy Reagan's hand-beaded gown by American couturier James Galanos cost $22,500 and oozed the Hollywood glamour that she and her actor-turned-politician husband brought to the White House.
It's a given that no matter how handsome President Obama might look in his tuxedo at the galas, all eyes will be on his companion.
"The first lady is both an American celebrity and one of the most visible representatives of the nation. She's 'our' first lady and our pride and interest, and curiosity, extends to what she wears," Graddy said.
See the past 100 years' worth of inaugural outfits in the gallery above.

Amanpour to girls: It's time to power the world
By Christiane Amanpour, CNN
updated 8:53 AM EDT, Mon June 17, 2013
To be born a girl in Afghanistan is often to be ushered into a life of servitude, where girls have very little worth and very dim futures. Amina is forced to marry at 12, to bear a child though still a child herself -- while her own brother is given her dowry money to buy a used car. But Amina, whose name was changed and story portrayed by an actress out of concern for her safety, has had enough, and she is fighting back. CNN Films' "Girl Rising" tells the stories of Amina and other girls from around the world and how the power of education can change the world. Learn more about the girls' inspiring stories.
(From 10x10)
"What if a girl's life could be more?" When Azmera turned 13, it was time for the Ethiopian girl to be given to a stranger in marriage, like her mother and grandmother before her. But Azmera refused. Azmera is fearful, but she is not alone. She has a champion beside her: an older brother who would give up anything for his sister to be able to stay in school. Together, brother and sister dare to reject her fate.
"Poetry is how I turn ugliness into art." La Rinconada, Peru, is a bleak corner of the world that regularly turns out two things: gold from deep within its mountain, which is immediately sent far away; and despair, which remains. Senna's is the poorest of the poor mining families clinging to that mountain. Every day is a struggle. Yet, somehow, she was given two magnificent gifts: a father who named her for a warrior princess and insisted that she goes to school, and a talent with words. And when Senna discovered poetry, everything changed. "Change is like a song you can't hold back." Suma's brothers are sent to school, but her parents have no money for a daughter's education. Given into bonded servitude at age 6, Suma labors in the house of a master from before dawn until late at night. For years, the Nepali girl suffers in silence, until music gives her a voice. A stroke of luck and kindness gives Suma a chance to go to school -- and a crusader is born.
"I will come back every day until I can stay." Wadley is 7 years old when the world comes crashing down around her. When Haiti's catastrophic earthquake destroys lives, homes and families, Wadley's happy life with her mother, filled with friends and school, becomes a struggle to survive in a teeming tent city, devastation and grief all around. But Wadley believes she is meant to do something special with her life -- and that the way to begin is by getting back to school. What happens when this irrepressible spirit confronts a system that tells her she is unworthy of an education is an inspiration to the world.
"Now there's nothing to stop me. Nothing in the world. Nothing in the universe." Mariama describes herself as a typical teenager, which in itself is remarkable. Her poverty-stricken country, Sierra Leone, is still recovering from a brutal decade of civil war. But Mariama isn't looking back; she is the voice of the future. She is the first in her family to go to school and already has her own radio show and dreams of being a famous scientist and a television star. "He was strong, but I was stronger." An Egyptian girl of 12 whose family can't afford to send her to school has very few options. She can become a street kid; she can become a bride; she can become a target. Yasmin -- whose name was changed and story portrayed by an actress out of concern for her safety -- is lured into the trap of a sexual predator. But what she doesn't become is a victim. Yasmin becomes a superhero. HIDE CAPTION

Editor's note: Christiane Amanpour is anchor of CNN's "Amanpour." This open letter to the girls of the world is part of the "Girl Rising" project. CNN Films' "Girl Rising" documents extraordinary girls and the power of education to change the world. Watch it June 16 on CNN.
(CNN) -- Dear Girls of the World,
There are more than 7 billion people in the world. Half of them are women and girls.
Just imagine the whole world rising, as it will, when all women and girls are empowered.
It has to start with education. All the number crunchers have it right on this one: education = empowerment, from here in the United States to Uruguay and Ulan Bator.
Christiane Amanpour
The United Nations, the World Bank and any organization you can think of say that an educated girl is a girl who can get a job, become a breadwinner and raise herself, her family, her village, her community and eventually her whole country. All the stories and statistics show that a healthy society is one whose women are healthy and productive.
Look at what women and girls are achieving for Rwanda, 19 years after the genocide there. The country leads the way in Africa in every way: education, health, the economy, the environment and in elected politics, powered by the force of its women. It is an amazing story. In contrast, the Arab world, which is so rich in natural resources such as oil and gas, is way behind in all development indicators, because half their populations, their women, are denied basic rights. It's why the Arab Spring must liberate and fully empower women, for the good of those countries.

Did you know that if female employment were to match male employment in the United States, gross domestic product would rise by 5%. And in developing countries that figure soars by double digits -- for instance, GDP would rise 34% in Egypt if women and men had equal employment opportunities.
And this is where education comes in. According to a 2004 report co-authored by Gene Sperling (now a senior economic aide to President Barack Obama), a woman can expect a 10% to 20% rise in earning power with every additional year of primary education beyond average. Another economist, Paul Schultz, found that number increased to 15% to 25% higher earning power with each additional year of secondary school. So educate our girls if you want to reduce infant mortality, stabilize population growth and reduce cases of HIV/AIDS.
In rural areas, the United Nations says wages, agriculture income and productivity all improve when the female workers are educated.
It is time to end the discrimination against girls in education. According to the U.N., around 35 million girls are not enrolled in primary school and that has to end.
Almost 800 million people worldwide are illiterate; two-thirds of them are women and girls. Imagine a world where they could actually read and write and do basic math for accounting -- that is how the world will change. Women are much more likely than men to use their earnings for the good of the family, rather than spending it on alcohol or other things for themselves.
Just ask the great microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus of Bangladesh's Grameen Bank -- women are the best bet. You lend them a little, and they pay back in spades. He has known this for 30 years.
It's high time the rest of the world caught on. Go girls! Power the world! We can do it.

Possible 'knockout' game victim: 'The whole group of kids laughed'
By CNN Staff
updated 11:55 PM EST, Tue November 26, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Phoebe Connolly was biking in Washington when she was punched in the face
The attack resembled another one that happened in the same area one day earlier
Authorities have reported similar incidents in New Jersey, New York, Illinois and Missouri
(CNN) -- Phoebe Connolly, a possible victim of game where teenagers appear to sucker-punch strangers, is encouraging people to think critically about how such attacks can be stopped.
Connolly was biking in the Columbia Heights area of Washington this month when she was struck. She had passed through a group of teenagers, she said, when one of them "reached out and punched me in the face."
"The whole group of kids laughed," Connolly told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" on Tuesday night.
She was not seriously injured.
Though Connolly had never heard of the "knockout game" before the November 15 attack, she may be a victim of it.
'Knockout game': Fact or fiction?
And she's not the only one.
Another woman was attacked in the same area one day earlier. She, too, sustained minor injuries and was not knocked out, according to Washington police.
A police spokeswoman said authorities are investigating the two attacks as simple assaults.
"The reason that I called the police was because my understanding of teenagers is they just don't always think about the ramifications of their actions, how they can hurt people, how they can cause problems for the rest of their lives," said Connolly, who works on youth programs.
She found fault with the popularity of so-called "knockout" videos.
"Instead of constantly replaying them on media, or on YouTube, or whatever it is, you know I really feel like that's just creating more of a culture of fear and polarization -- instead of actually spending time thinking about why it is that people are choosing to do this and how can it be stopped and prevented," she said.
Authorities have reported similar incidents in New Jersey, New York, Illinois and Missouri.
One of the latest attacks happened in New York, according to Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. A woman in her 70s was punched in the face by a man with whom she had no known previous contact or connection. She was treated and released from the hospital.
Authorities are working to determine whether she is a "knockout" victim, Kelly said.
Despite the recent assaults, police in New York say they haven't yet seen evidence of a trend, though they are not ruling out the idea.
"The press has named it the so-called knockout game. We don't discount that that exists. It's a possibility. We've investigated and will continue to investigate," Kelly told reporters Tuesday.
Police keep close eye on reports of disturbing 'knockout' game
CNN's Dana Ford and Morgan Winsor contributed to this report.
