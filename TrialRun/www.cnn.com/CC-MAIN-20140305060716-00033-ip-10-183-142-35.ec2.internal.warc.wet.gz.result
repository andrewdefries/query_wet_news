Obama invites congressional leaders for budget talks By the CNN Wire Staff Tea Party budget positions too extreme?STORY HIGHLIGHTSHouse Republicans propose another short-term extensionDemocrats, Republicans differ on cuts in mandatory programsThe meeting will take place on Tuesday, the White House saysWithout an agreement, the government would shut down after Friday Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama has invited congressional leaders for a meeting Tuesday to try to push through a budget deal three days before the deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown, the White House announced Monday. The meeting comes as Republican and Democratic leaders signaled a continuing stalemate in negotiations on how much to cut government spending for the rest of the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30. Without a deal by Friday, when the current spending authorization measure expires, parts of the government will shut down. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that "significant progress" has been made in talks so far, including agreement on a target figure of $33 billion in total spending cuts below current levels. Republican leaders, however, disagreed that any agreement had been reached on a total figure and said a government shutdown would be because of inaction on the parts of Obama and Democrats.

On Monday night, a senior House Republican leadership aide told CNN that House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders were proposing a one-week extension of the current spending resolution that would avert a shutdown and include spending cuts, while also funding the Department of Defense for the rest of the fiscal year. Another GOP source said the spending cuts could be about $12 billion. The new extension is "an option" for now, the senior House GOP leadership aide stressed, with no vote on it scheduled by the House. If negotiators come up with a broader agreement, the new House proposal could be amended, the aide said. Republican leaders previously rejected the possibility of another short-term spending resolution like the ones that have kept the government funded for the first half of fiscal year 2011. By posting the new short-term proposal on Monday night, House Republicans were ensuring they could act before Friday's expiration of the current spending measure. Under rules adopted in January, bills must be available online for 72 hours before a vote. An aide to Boehner, speaking on condition of not being identified by name, said Boehner also told House Administration Committee Chairman Dan Lungren, R-California, to issue guidance to all members Tuesday on how the House would operate in the event of a government shutdown. Earlier, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, accused Democrats of "promoting false promises and using sleight-of-hand budgeting to achieve an imaginary spending cut figure that is still far too low." However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said it was Republicans who were refusing to compromise on a bill passed by the GOP-controlled House that would cut $61 billion in discretionary funding. Democrats consider the House bill draconian, complaining it would cut key programs for continued economic recovery while eliminating funding for others opposed by conservatives, such as Planned Parenthood and National Public Radio. Reid cited conservatives backed by the Tea Party movement for their unwillingness to work with his side. "Tea Party Republicans refuse to recognize that their budget is simply an appalling proposal," Reid said of the House bill. "They stomp their feet and call compromise a dirty word and insist on a budget that will hurt America rather than help it." Carney also called for "solutions that can garner bipartisan support," urging a process "where both sides come together, calmly, willing to jettison their maximalist position because they know they won't get everything they want." He said invitations for the Tuesday meeting went to Reid; Boehner, R-Ohio; Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Dan Inouye, D-Hawaii; and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky. A senior Democratic source with knowledge of the ongoing negotiations said the biggest remaining obstacle to a deal involves whether reductions in mandatory spending programs, known in appropriations parlance as "Changes in Mandatory Spending" or CHIMPS, should be part of spending cuts. Examples of mandatory spending programs include Pell Grants, the Children's Health Insurance Program and some types of highway funding. Such programs are funded for multiple years at a time, with the spending set for the time period covered, exempt from congressional authorization each year. According to the senior Democratic source, the chiefs of staff to Inouye and Rogers negotiated throughout the weekend, and the gap between them is about $8 billion to $10 billion. Multiple Democratic sources say they want about half the overall cuts in this spending bill to come from mandatory spending programs, and that they have proposed the necessary reductions in programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Justice Department, the Treasury and Pell Grants. Republicans, who want any spending cuts to reflect a reduction in the size of government, note that reducing the spending in mandatory program for one year doesn't prevent the amount from going back to its original level the following year. "I've made clear that their $33 billion is not enough and many of the cuts that the White House and Senate Democrats are talking about are full of smoke and mirrors," Boehner said Monday. Other issues being negotiated include the amount of cuts in nonmilitary discretionary spending and so-called "policy riders" sought by Republicans to prevent federal funding of programs they oppose such as Planned Parenthood. Democratic sources also say Republicans are balking at a Democratic proposal to cut $2 billion to $3 billion in military spending. On Sunday, top senators from both parties said they expected a deal to avoid a government shutdown but made clear that little consensus exists on other looming budget battles. Reid said on the CBS program "Face the Nation" that Republican negotiators feared a backlash from the conservative Tea Party movement if they meet Democrats halfway on a budget deal. Because of a surge in conservative support driven by the Tea Party movement, Republicans won control of the House in November and reduced the Democratic majority in the Senate. Tea Party activists already have criticized Boehner for signaling possible agreement on smaller cuts than called for in the bill passed by the House but rejected by the Senate. Boehner's hard-line stance Monday reflected the conservatives' concern. "It's become sadly evident to me, and to the American people, that the White House and Senate Democrats are just not serious yet about enacting real spending cuts," Boehner said in a statement. "And real spending cuts are essential if we're going to create a better environment for job growth in our country." CNN's Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh and Tom Cohen contributed to this story

2 presidential candidates face off in Egypt's first such televised debate
From Ben Brumfield, CNN
updated 11:45 PM EDT, Thu May 10, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Abdelmoneim Abolfotoh calls Amre Moussa a "symbol of the former regime" NEW: Moussa points to Abolfotoh's involvement in Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya The two were the only two of 13 candidates in Egypt's first ever such presidential debate
A survey says they are the front-runners, Egyptians embrace democracy and Islam
(CNN) -- The two leading candidates to become Egypt's next president after Hosni Mubarak squared off for hours Thursday and into Friday in the nation's first such televised debate, just two weeks ahead of the country's election.
A pair of private television stations, but not state TV, aired the showdown between Amre Moussa and Abdelmoneim Abolfotoh that finally ended around 2 a.m. Friday (8 p.m. ET). Not including a break, both men ended up standing on stage for about three hours.
The tone was generally even-keeled, with a few notable points of contention.
One came when Abolfotoh questioned whether Egyptians could support a "symbol of the former regime" in Moussa, who served as foreign minister under Mubarak.
"I had left the government 10 years ago, so I wasn't part of the problem," Moussa said of those railing against Mubarak's government, before turning the tables on Abolfotoh, a candidate seen as a moderate who once belonged to the Muslim Brotherhood. "You, as well, kept silent. You were defending the position of the Muslim Brotherhood, not the position or interests of Egyptians."

New clashes ahead of elections in Cairo
Moussa later pointed to Abolfotoh's involvement in Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, or the Egyptian Islamic Group, which had members who were convicted of killing hundreds of Egyptians.
Abolfotoh said he is proud to be part of building that movement when it was peaceful in the 1970s, before again trying to lump Moussa in with the reported killings and torturing of thousands while he served in the 1990s under Mubarak.
A poll published Monday by the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies showed Moussa leading by a considerable margin, thanks to his popularity in poorer, more densely populated provinces, where many long for stability associated with the old regime.
Behind in second was Abolfotoh, who does particularly well among more educated voters according to the same poll.
The two answered questions on the constitution, taxes and balancing human rights with providing security during the first part of the debate, before turning their attentions to foreign affairs, priorities and their opinion of military leaders who have been Egypt's ruling power since Mubarak's ouster.
Opinion: Is Egypt headed for Islamist rule?
Abolfotoh tried to set himself apart from Egypt's current leadership by blaming "the different parties involved" for clashes this spring Cairo's central Abbasiya district that left one dead and about 300 injured
"I don't think if I was the president that the Abbasiya incident would have happened at all," he said. "It is important to stress that the right of peaceful demonstration is one of the gains of the January 25 revolution."
Moussa, a proudly secular candidate who most recently was secretary-general of the Arab League, explained his vision for an Egypt that is committed to making citizens' lives better.
"We want to ensure that every citizen in all of Egypt -- in the north, south, east and west -- that the state is moving in the right way to progress and to respond to people's requirements," said Egypt's former foreign minister and one-time Arab League secretary-general.
Abolfotoh and Moussa are among 13 candidates vying for the presidency. Among those not invited to Thursday's debate were Mohamed Morsi, the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party.
While his party holds a majority in parliament, Morsi enjoys less popularity personally, placing fourth in the Al-Ahram poll.
Asked Wednesday whether the Muslim Brotherhood would move Egypt in the direction of an Iranian-style Islamic republic, Morsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that his party supports democracy and not theocracy.
"There is no such thing called an 'Islamic democracy,' " he said. "There is democracy only, and democracy is the instrument that is present now. The people are the source of authority."
Another candidate absent from Thursday's debate was former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq, who was third in the Al-Ahram poll.
Egyptians will vote for their new president nearly 16 months after the popular uprising that brought down Mubarak in February 2011.
Distrust and anger, particularly against the military's power in Egypt's governmental affairs, still inspire protests, some of which have been marked by deadly clashes.
Twelve died and hundreds were injured last week in violence that ensued during protests against the military in Cairo's central Abbasiya district.
The protests erupted amid a backdrop of frustration about the pace of reform since Mubarak's ouster and over concern that Egypt's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule.
Although the anger against the military is palpable, the Egyptian population as a whole still has a favorable view of the the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, according to a Pew Research Center survey published Tuesday.
The survey also found among Egyptians strong support for democracy -- preferring it widely to any other form of government -- as well as the institutions that support it, such as a free press.
Concerns about the economy ranked about as high with Egyptian voters in the Pew survey as the importance of democracy.
Islam is seen as a desirable basis for making laws, and most Egyptians favor a more religious approach to society as seen in Saudi Arabia over the secular approach of Turkey.
CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali and Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.

Israeli Defense Minister Barak says he's quitting politics
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 7:53 PM EST, Mon November 26, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: PLO official: "I hope this signals recognition of the futility of the military approach in ... dealing with the Palestinians"
Ehud Barak says he wants to spend more time with his family
Despite speculation of a new party, he says he won't contest the elections due in January
His resignation comes after a lethal conflict with Hamas in Gaza
Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak announced his resignation Monday, saying he will quit politics in January to spend more time with his family.
His resignation comes at a highly delicate time for Israel, which is observing a fragile cease-fire with the militant Palestinian group Hamas after an eight-day conflict that killed more than 160 people -- the overwhelming majority of them Palestinians in Gaza.

Barak, who is married and the father of three children, said Monday at a news conference in Tel Aviv that he will continue as defense minister for the next three months, as elections are due in January. He said he won't contest the elections.
Barak: Bulgaria attack will be avenged
1-on-1 with Israel's defense minister Ehud Barak: Obama friendly to Israel
Barak: Iran heading toward objective Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee, weighed in on the announcement.
"I hope this signals recognition of the futility of the military approach in the adoption of violence as means of dealing with the Palestinians," she said. "If it is for personal reasons, we cannot comment, but if it's recognition that his whole career was based on the military approach to political life, then this demonstrates the recognition of the futility of militarism and violence."
Some Israeli political commentators had speculated ahead of the announcement that Barak was planning to quit the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form a new center-left party.

But Barak told reporters that new faces in leadership roles would benefit Israel.
"I feel it is important that other people should take leading positions in Israel. Changes in the position of power are a good thing. There are many ways to contribute to the society and the country, and not necessarily through politics," he said.
Barak served as defense minister under former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert between 2007 and 2009, and retained the post under Netanyahu from 2009 until the present. He also held the title of deputy prime minister for both administrations.
He had previously served as prime minister between July 1999 and March 2001, when he was defeated in an election by Ariel Sharon. From 2001 until his return to politics in 2005, Barak worked in the private sector.

North Korea issues threat to U.S. military
By Ben Brumfield and KJ Kwon, CNN
updated 9:13 AM EST, Sat February 23, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The message was delivered over the phone in English, reports say
Such threat happen routinely before U.S.-South Korean exercises The exercises come in the wake of a recent nuclear test in North Korea
South Korea's military is already in a state of heightened alert (CNN) -- Ahead of annual, routine military exercises between South Korea and the United States, North Korea issued its usual caustic objections Saturday.
It threatened "miserable destruction," if "your side ignites a war of aggression by staging the reckless joint military exercises ... at this dangerous time."
Though customary, the stark posturing by North Korea stands in the shadow of an underground nuclear test two weeks ago that was preceded by the launch of a long-range missile capable of transporting a warhead.
The detonation of the nuclear charge was the third in Pyongyang's history and the first under supreme leader Kim Jong Un's rule. South Korea's military reacted with fierce military drills, including a public display of newly deployed cruise missiles with pinpoint accuracy.
It has been on heightened readiness ever since.
North Korea's nuclear ambitions
What exactly is North Korea capable of?
What North Koreans think about tests The test also triggered a global wave of condemnation, including from Beijing, and plans for new sanctions against Pyongyang.
North Korea issued the objections to exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle scheduled for March and April to U.S. commander James D. Sherman, state run news agency KCNA reported.
The message was delivered over the phone in English, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.
It also condemned the threat of new sanctions over North Korea's recent actions.
A United Nations military commission informed Pyongyang of the upcoming routine exercises, according to a joint statement from U.S. and South Korean military officials.
The commission also told North Korea that they are "not related with the current situations on the Korean Peninsula."
Around 10,000 U.S. forces will participate in Foal Eagle from March 1 to April 30. Key Resolve will involve 10,000 South Korean troops and 3,500 U.S. troops in exercises March 11 to 21.

CNN - Simpson defense rests - Jan. 14, 1997 Simpson defense rests
Plaintiffs begin rebuttal case next
January 14, 1997
Web posted at: 3:00 p.m. EST
SANTA MONICA, California (CNN) -- The defense in the O.J. Simpson civil trial rested Tuesday following testimony from Simpson's eldest daughter, Arnelle.
Arnelle Simpson's testimony was meant to corroborate statements made by her father on the stand and contradict some made by detectives who investigated the June 12, 1994, murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Arnelle Simpson testified that she was told by Detective Tom Lange that Nicole Brown Simpson and someone else had been killed. Detectives have said that they told her only of Nicole's death.
O.J. Simpson testified that he was told by telephone -- possibly by his daughter -- that his ex-wife was not the only victim in the slayings. Arnelle Simpson, who lived in one of the guest houses on her father's estate at the time, also contradicted police testimony that she let them into her father's home through the back door.
The witness said she didn't let them in that way because she assumed the back door was locked from the inside and it cannot be opened with a key when it is locked.
Earlier, Los Angeles police officer Donald Thompson was called to the stand by the defense. He testified he received orders from lead detective Phil Vannatter on June 13 to handcuff Simpson when he returned home from Chicago.
Vannatter denied giving such an order.
The defense portion of the case began December 9 and spanned 14 court days in the civil wrongful death suit brought by the Brown and Goldman families against the former football star. The plaintiffs' rebuttal case will begin next. That phase of the trial is expected to last four days.
Correspondent Jim Moret contributed to this report.
