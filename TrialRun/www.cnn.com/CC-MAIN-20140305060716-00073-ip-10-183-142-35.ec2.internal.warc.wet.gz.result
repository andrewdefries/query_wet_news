Teen guilty of 'thrill kill' murder, beheadingStory Highlights NEW: Jean Paul Orlewicz guilty of murder, beheading of acquaintance Jury deliberated for more than 10 hours over two days Former co-defendant cut testimony deal with prosecutors on eve of trial Friends testified that Orlewicz wanted to commit a crime, get away with it Next Article in Crime » Read VIDEO In Session, formerly Court TV, is CNN's partner for trial coverage. DETROIT, Michigan (CNN/In Session) -- A jury rejected an 18-year-old's claim that he acted in self-defense, finding him guilty of murder in the gory stabbing, beheading and torching of a Michigan man. Jean Pierre Olewicz says he feared for his life when he killed Daniel Sorenson. The jury of eight men and four women deliberated for more than 10 hours over two days before finding Jean Pierre Orlewicz guilty of first-degree murder, felony murder and mutilation. Jurors did not look at anyone as they filed into the courtroom. The defendant's family remained stoic, but the father of victim Daniel Sorenson broke into sobs. Watch as the verdict is read » During the trial, some of the most gruesome details of Sorenson's slaying came from the youthful-looking defendant's own lips. Prosecutors called Sorenson's slaying a "thrill killing." They alleged that Orlewicz was excited by the prospect of killing someone and getting away with it. Orlewicz, of Canton, Michigan, took the stand and admitted that he killed Sorenson, 26, but insisted that it was in self-defense. He admitted stabbing Sorenson 13 times after an extortion plan went awry and Sorenson threatened his life. "There was not a murder," Orlewicz testified. On November 7, Orlewicz said, he, Alexander Letkemann and Sorenson arrived at his grandfather's house in Canton, Michigan, with the intent of robbing Adam Duwe, who had just inherited $40,000. But Orlewicz said he felt "icky" about the plan and was going to pretend Duwe couldn't make it. That's when Sorenson's temper flared, Orlewicz testified. Orlewicz said Sorenson took out a gun and threatened to kill him. "You think this is a game?" Orlewicz recalled Sorenson screaming. "I'm going to drop you to your knees and blow your frigging brains out." Don't Miss Sidebar: Read the trial blogs
WDIV: Local coverage
Orlewicz said Sorenson began waiving the gun around, so he grabbed a knife from a tool bench and stabbed him from behind. As the two fought, Orlewicz said, the gun dropped from Sorenson's hand. Sorenson scrambled to find the gun, Orlewicz said, and the two continued to struggle. "I kept trying to stab him and get leverage in the fight," Orlewicz said. "I was stabbing him in the back." During his testimony Orlewicz also admitted that after Sorenson died, he used a hacksaw to decapitate him. Orlewicz said he threw Sorenson's torso into a field and set it on fire. The defendant said he took a blowtorch to Sorenson's hands to cover up fingerprints. Orlewicz told the jury he feared that Sorenson was tied to the Mafia and that his family would come after him. He said his actions after the death were all out of panic. Orlewicz corroborated Letkemann's testimony that Letkemann stood by and did nothing as Orlewicz stabbed Sorenson. Letkemann, 18, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder April 1. He will face 20 to 30 years in prison in exchange for his testimony against Orlewicz. Orlewicz denied Letkemann's assertions that after the killing, he played with Sorenson's head like a puppet. "That's someone else's imagination," he said. Prosecutors paraded several witnesses in front of the jury who claimed Orlewicz had said that he wanted to kill someone and that he owned a gun. Orlewicz denied the claims, including one man's testimony that he watched Orlewicz take out the gun, put one bullet in the chamber and play Russian roulette. Alex Mullins, 17, told police he was supposed to be the lookout on November 6 when Orlewicz planned to kill Sorenson. When the plan was postponed until the next day, Mullins decided he didn't want to be involved, he testified. Orlewicz had spoken for weeks about wanting to kill Sorenson, Mullins added. "He wanted to stab Dan," Mullins said. "He wanted to bag him up in a tarp, hang him upside down from a tree, burning. He said he wanted to cut his head off." Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Robert Moran told jurors in his closing arguments that Orlewicz's self-defense theory was bogus and that Orlewicz's testimony about an extortion plan was a cover-up for a gruesome calculated murder. "There was no plan to extort money," Moran said. "That was the ruse to get the victim there." Defense Attorney Joseph Niskar asked the jury in his closing arguments to consider the "fear factor" that came into play when Sorenson, who was twice Orlewicz's size, threatened his client with a gun. Niskar argued that if Orlewicz had plotted the murder, he wouldn't have brought a "knife to a gunfight" but instead a stronger weapon to combat the gun he knew Sorenson had. Moran told the jury that the only possible way for them to find Orlewicz not guilty was to be believe his testimony rather than every single other person who took the stand. For someone who feared for his life, Orlewicz was fairly calm about the gruesome actions he took against Sorenson, Moran said. "Where was his emotion when he testified?" Moran asked. "Where was his emotion when he testified that he had to kill Mr. Sorensen? When he had to cut off his head? He testified like he was ordering a pizza. A typical day. That's him. That's cold." He recounted the gory details of how Orlewicz admitted to decapitating Sorenson and covering up the crime, saying: "We'll never forget it." "Thanks, Mr. Orlewicz," Moran said.

Commentary: Why hate crimes are differentStory HighlightsLevin, McDevitt: Senate to vote on Matthew Shepard hate crime billThey say loopholes in existing laws require new legislationThey say bill would provide federal help to localities fighting hate crimeLevin, McDevitt: Hate crimes target pluralistic societies along with victimsNext Article in Crime » By Brian Levin and Jack McDevitt Special to CNN	Editor's note: Brian Levin is director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Jack McDevitt is the director of the Institute on Race and Justice and Associate Dean in the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. Both have testified before Congress in support of federal hate crime legislation and are co-authors of a book on hate in America, due to be published next year. Brian Levin says a new federal hate crime law is needed to combat violent incidents of bias. SAN BERNARDINO, California (CNN) -- America needs a coordinated and multifaceted response to combat the continuing scourge of violent hate crime like the crime committed at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on June 10. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, originally introduced by Sen. Edward Kennedy a decade ago and nearly passed during the most recent legislative session, is expected to go before the Senate for a vote soon. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder testified on its behalf Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It is a crucial step in the nation's evolving response to hate crime. A hate crime occurs when an individual intentionally targets a victim or their property because of his or her actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, disability or sexual orientation. While some have argued that these kind of laws criminalize free speech, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in the 1993 case, Wisconsin v. Mitchell, that well-drafted hate crime laws are constitutional and do not punish speech. Rather they enhance the penalties only for acts that are already considered crimes. The act is named for Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old gay college student who was kidnapped, robbed, tortured and left to die, tied to a fence in a remote area outside of Laramie, Wyoming in October 1998. His mother Judy has been a tireless advocate for hate crime laws and victims. The Shepard Act remedies legal loopholes in federal and state criminal law that fail to protect against bias-motivated attacks based on such characteristics as sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and disability. It also removes antiquated "Klan era" language that forces federal prosecutors to tie violent racial attacks to a small number of activities such as participating in a jury, voting or using hotels. As recent events have indicated, today's violent hate offenders, unlike their predecessors, will often swing into brutal action on their own initiative without waiting for a victim to exercise a specific activity covered by old 1960s laws. However, much of the act's potency lies not in what it punishes, but rather in its recognition of the primary role local authorities now play in combating hate crime. Nearly all hate crime investigations and prosecutions in the United States are handled by state and local authorities, such as the Boston Police or Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police. Gone are the days where masses of federal agents and soldiers had to swoop into states to protect new students and freedom riders from thugs in Klan-dominated municipalities. The act has a clear bias in favor of local prosecution and has restrictions that require federal prosecution only in limited cases where the leadership of the DJ approves. However, reporting data indicates that some states apparently provide limited assistance to hate crime victims. These jurisdictions report either zero hate crimes or a handful of crime to the FBI, year after year, while neighboring states with similar demographics and crime profiles report far more. A 2005 Bureau of Justice Statistics victimization study found that only a small fraction of hate crimes nationally are actually reported. Thus, there appear to be various instances where federal help or prosecution are still necessary. Today, in the midst of our economic downturn, federal authorities are needed much more to assist cash-strapped local departments, not as an unwelcome occupying force, but as a desperately needed partner to assist with forensics, technical assistance and investigations. Even in police departments with model hate crime investigative units, such as the Boston Police Department's Community Disorders Unit, modern cases increasingly involve interstate travel or Internet hate networks, and require sophisticated ballistic and DNA testing or computer forensics. These measures may be beyond the capacity of many local police agencies, particularly in difficult economic times. The act also provides greater access to local communities for federal training programs and mediation services that can prevent hate crimes before they boil over into violence. Our research has established that hate crimes are a qualitatively unique category of offenses. Compared to non-bias motivated crimes these crimes are more likely to involve violence, injury, hospitalization, psychological trauma and a greater risk of retaliatory attacks, which can often spill across municipal borders. And while we cannot say whether hate crimes overall are actually increasing, there does appear to be an increase in the most violent hate crimes. In 2007, hate-motivated homicides claimed nine lives, up from three in 2006, and the last year has seen a steady stream of violent plots and attacks against symbolic targets by hardened hate-mongers. Since the beginning of the year we have seen many examples of extremist crimes. Here are a few: Brockton, Massachusetts: January 21 -- White supremacist Keith Luke 22, allegedly kills two, rapes one, and shoots another while en route to a synagogue to kill Jews. Miramar Beach, Florida: February 26 -- Dannie Baker, 60, a man known for anti-immigrant rantings, allegedly shoots 5, killing two Chilean immigrants. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: April 5 -- Neo-Nazi Richard Poplawski, 22, agitated over the belief that President Obama would ban guns, allegedly kills three police officers during a domestic violence call. New York: May 20 -- Four Muslim converts are arrested on federal charges relating to a plot to bomb Jewish and military targets. Pima County, Arizona: May 30 -- Leaders of the Minuteman American Defense group allegedly kill a 29-year-old Latino man and his nine-year-old daughter in an attempt to steal drugs and money to finance their civilian border patrol group. Washington: June 10 -- Holocaust denier James von Brunn, 88, allegedly kills a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Two national research reports released last week document a disturbing level of supremacist activities and overall violence against a broad range of groups. Another report from the Southern Poverty Law Center counted a record number of 926 hate groups in the United States last year. But there is something more to hate crime's harms that cannot be completely captured by statistics or criminological studies. As the Holocaust Museum attack demonstrates, hate crimes threaten pluralistic democracies in a way that other crimes do not. Unlike many other crimes, they are at once discriminatory and terroristic. As law professor James Weinstein observed: "The effect of Kristallnacht on German Jews was greater than the sum of the damage to buildings and assaults on individual victims." Violence and threats that destabilize the bonds between citizens and the democratic institutions that they share are worthy of additional punishment and federal assistance. Moreover, victims of hate-motivated violence are entitled to legal protection no matter where they reside. That is why over two-thirds of the American public favor hate crime laws, and why the Senate should heed their call to pass the Shepard Act. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Levin and Jack McDevitt.

Czechs sign EU Lisbon Treaty as last obstacle falls The signature of Czech President Vaclav Klaus means the Lisbon Treaty could come into force within weeks. STORY HIGHLIGHTSCzech President Vaclav Klaus signs EU's Lisbon Treaty, paving way for major changes to way 27-nation bloc is runCzech court removed the last political hurdle to treaty's full ratificationThe Lisbon Treaty is meant to replace the EU constitution, which voters rejected in 2005All member states have to ratify the treaty before it can be adopted

Czech Republic
(CNN) -- Czech President Vaclav Klaus signed the European Union's Lisbon Treaty Tuesday, he announced on his Web site, paving the way for major changes to the way the 27-nation bloc is run. The Czech Constitutional court ruled hours earlier that the treaty did not conflict with the country's constitution, a government spokesman said. "I respect the decision of the Constitutional Court," Klaus said in a written statement, though he added he "disagreed" with it and said the court's analysis was "not neutral." However, he concluded, "I signed the Lisbon Treaty at 3 p.m. (1400 GMT)." The Czech Republic was the last EU nation left to approve the treaty, which could effectively give the EU a president and a foreign minister. Klaus's signature means the treaty -- which would replace the EU constitution and aims to streamline the workings of the European Union -- could come into force as early as December 1. The Czech Parliament's two chambers voted in favor of the treaty earlier this year. But in late September, 17 Czech senators asked the country's Constitutional Court to examine whether some further parts of the treaty were compatible with the country's constitution. The court ruled Tuesday that they pose no conflict. Klaus agreed Friday to ratify the document if the court approved, after winning an exemption ensuring it would not allow ethnic Germans forced out of the country after World War II to reclaim their former lands. "I consider this to be the best possible result and intend to raise no other objections to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty," Klaus said Thursday after gaining the exemption. Voters in two countries had rejected the EU constitution in 2005. The Lisbon Treaty, in addition to streamlining EU decision-making and creating an EU council president and foreign minister, would introduce rotating representatives for member countries in the EU Commission, the union's executive branch, and would change the voting weights of countries on certain issues. Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said he welcomed the Czech court's decision. "We are now very close to full ratification." Reinfeldt said. "Together with a signature in the Czech Republic, the presidency will continue the completion of Lisbon Treaty preparations." The Czech Republic isn't the only EU country to demand an exemption before ratifying the treaty. Poland recently won an opt-out over social issues including gay marriage; Britain won assurances that EU law would not prevail over its own legal system. The treaty would also give national parliaments veto power over some proposed changes to EU policy. All member states have to ratify the treaty before it can be adopted. Irish voters approved the treaty last month after previously rejecting it. The European Union had assured Ireland that the treaty would not affect the country's anti-abortion laws or its neutrality and that Ireland would keep a European commissioner.

By Elizabeth Landau, CNN Weiner seeking treatmentSTORY HIGHLIGHTSThe way that a person cheats on a spouse signals underlying issues to the therapistTreatment might focus on the roots of potentially self-destructive behaviorA therapist could also help mend ties between Rep. Anthony Weiner and his wife (CNN) -- It seems like there's therapy for everything these days, including sending photos of yourself in various states of undress to members of the opposite sex on the Internet. After a picture of his crotch appeared on his Twitter feed in May, Rep. Anthony Weiner admitted last week to sending "messages and photos of explicit nature with about six women in the last three years." Over the weekend, Democratic leaders called for his resignation; Monday, the White House called Weiner's scandal a "distraction." And President Obama told NBC's "Today" that if he were in Weiner's position, he would resign. But the New York congressman has declined to resign and instead sought a leave of absence to seek help. He's decided to seek treatment "to focus on becoming a better husband and healthier person," his spokeswoman said Saturday. Although the nature of this treatment is not known, psychologists unconnected with Weiner say that, based on the public information available about his behavior, the congressman should enter therapy to explore the underlying reasons for engaging in repeated indiscretions that may have threatened his career. Tapping into childhood memories It's not just cheating, but also the way it happens, that reflects a person's issues, said M. Gary Neuman, author of "Connect to Love" and a family counselor in Miami.

Is sexting adultery?
Some people go to great lengths to hide their indiscretions; others cheat in ways that can easily be discovered. Those who are more daringly public in their unfaithfulness tend to have a lower sense of self-worth, Neuman said. However subconscious, it's as if they want to get caught and be shamed, he said. "They are impulsively doing something, without thinking, that says, 'Deep down, I'm not this good. I can't have people looking at me saying I'm so wonderful. I'm going to set the record straight,'" Neuman said. The most important part of such a person's treatment would be to understand what would lead him to want to put himself a potentially self-sabotaging situation, he said. Weiner's photo leaked out because he was sending it through Twitter, a social media platform that is largely public. While it can be used for private messages, a small typo can result in a public broadcast, which is what happened to Weiner. "I intended to send (the photo) as a direct message to a woman as part of a joke to a woman in Seattle," Weiner said last week. With the help of a counselor, a person with these issues would perhaps have to look into his own sexual past, as well as the relationship of his parents, to examine what might influence the way he relates to females, Neuman said. The roots of these kinds of issues often begin in childhood, said Lauren Mackler, psychotherapist and author of "Solemate." A therapist might help the person explore early life experiences, environment, self-image and role models, which all contribute to the "inner template" of how a person sees himself or herself. "It's like a telescope glued on their head. It's how they see themselves, how they see the world, and how they react and behave to world around them," she said. It's hard work to realize that you have acted in wrongful ways. It may take a few months of intense analysis of your own behavior to control certain behaviors, and the overall process may be lifelong, Neuman said. Rep. Weiner's political climb

Restoring trust Another key piece of therapy is damage control: Repairing ties with his wife and the rest of his family, Neuman said. Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, have been married for less than one year, and are expecting their first child. Some husbands say they're sorry, and they might mean it and never want to repeat the bad behavior, Neuman said. Unfortunately, there may be deeper issues that result in relapse. "Whatever the problem internally, psychologically, that got them to do this is going to rear its ugly head again. Saying 'I'm sorry' is not going to stop that," Neuman said. In a group therapy setting, a person in this position might join others who have suffered consequences of cheating, Neuman said. If he goes to one-on-one therapy, his wife may come in for some of the sessions to talk things out, experts say. But the intent to get help must be serious; the person shouldn't just say what he thinks people want to hear. Rebuilding their relationship is possible, but it could take years, Mackler said. And it will take more than couples' counseling. The person might have to commit to giving his wife all of his computer and online passwords to help rebuild trust, Neuman said. "He will have to be an open book about everything he does technologically, so that she is not sitting there worried that he's doing something under the radar that's going to come back to shock her again," Neuman said.

Miami Heat win 91-85 after late-game Oklahoma blunders
By Molly Gray, for CNN
updated 1:14 PM EDT, Mon June 18, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 91-85 Sunday night
The Heat are now up 2-1 in the seven-game NBA Finals
(CNN) -- A missed three-pointer by Russell Westbrook in the final minute of Sunday's game signaled the end of a fierce back-and-forth between the Miami Heat and Oklahoma City Thunder in game three of the 2012 NBA Finals.
The shot, which could have tied the game and 88 all, led to a fast break and free throws from the Heat, who went on to win 91-85.
The Heat now lead two games to one in the best of seven series.
The two teams battled closely all night, entering the second half with a one-point Miami lead, 47-46. However, the Thunder weren't able to fight back after the Heat went on a six-point run with only three minutes remaining in the game.

LeBron James: Gonna give it my all
Westbrook said the game, which was played in Miami, wasn't about one play or series of plays but rather a lot of small mistakes.
"Just little things ... giving them easy layups," Westbrook told reporters after the game. "We've got to cut that down."
However, Oklahoma City's final minutes were marred with sloppy play. In addition to Westbrook's missed shot, forward Kevin Durant missed a short jumper and guard Thabo Sefolosha turned the ball over.
"We turned the ball over in that second half too many times," Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks said. "They made some plays down the stretch that we did not make."
Miami forward LeBron James, who lead the game in points and rebounds with 29 and 14 respectively, had several key defensive rebounds leading up to the final buzzer.
"That's one thing I'm proud of. Last year I didn't make enough game-changing plays," James said. "I'm just trying to step up and be there for my teammates."
Despite foul trouble late in the game, Durant had a team-high 25 points and remained positive going into the rest of the series.
"Unfortunately I get a lot of fouls called on me but I have to play through it," Durant said. "Hopefully next game I will play smarter and get fewer fouls."
One point where the teams were decidedly unmatched Sunday night was on free throw shots. The Heat racked up 31 points from the line, while Oklahoma City managed just 15.
Forward Chris Bosh for the Heat, credits his team's aggressiveness for the volume of free throw attempts.
"Being aggressive. That's what we want to do," Bosh told reporters. "We want to put pressure to the rim."
Game four tips off Tuesday night in Miami.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Conservative judge Robert Bork died Wednesday
He was best known for the confirmation battle over his 1987 Supreme Court nomination
Bork was a staunch advocate for a strict interpretation of the Constitution
He was 85
Washington (CNN) -- Former federal judge and conservative legal scholar Robert Bork died early Wednesday at his Virginia home, his family confirmed to CNN. He was 85.
Perhaps best known for his nomination to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, Bork was rejected for the post after a contentious confirmation battle led by left-leaning groups that opposed his conservative judicial philosophies.
Bork had recently served as a senior legal adviser to Republican Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. He was a solicitor general during the Nixon administration and first gained notoriety for carrying out the president's order to fire the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal in 1973, an episode known as the Saturday Night Massacre.
But it was the Senate's rejection of his high court nomination that earned the conservative Bork a political legacy -- symbolic of the contentious, partisan nature of congressional confirmations.

Bork was also known as a staunch advocate for "originalism," a principle that defends the original intent of the Constitution.
In recent years, Bork became a well-regarded conservative voice on legal and constitutional matters, as well as the author of several books including "Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline." He was also a frequent commentator.
He told CNN in 2005 that he had to endure his failed nomination as a metaphor. To "Bork" someone has entered the popular lexicon as attacking a public figure in the media for partisan gain.
"My name became a verb," he said. "And I regard that as one form of immortality."
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a longtime friend, described Bork as "one of the most influential legal scholars of the past 50 years."
"His impact on legal thinking in the fields of Antitrust and Constitutional Law was profound and lasting," said Scalia. "More important for the final accounting, he was a good man and a loyal citizen. May he rest in peace."
Photos: 15 Supreme Court cases that changed America
Scalia and fellow conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas followed Bork's example of a strict interpretation of the Constitution.
That position made Bork "one of the intellectual godfathers of the conservative movement in this country," according to CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.
Robert Heron Bork was born in Pittsburgh in 1927 and attended the University of Chicago Law School, where his conservative leanings were forged. He was a Marine Corps veteran.
After private practice and a teaching stint at Yale Law School, he was named to the Justice Department in 1973 at the height of the Watergate crisis. When Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy William Ruckelshaus abruptly resigned rather than carry out orders to dismiss special prosecutor Archibald Cox, Bork stepped in and carried out Nixon's demands.
He was criticized for bowing to political pressure but remained on the job. Nixon resigned a year later.
Reagan named Bork in 1981 to the high-profile U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, where he served with future justices Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Bork was seriously considered for the 1986 high court vacancy that eventually went to Scalia, who still serves as the senior associate justice.
The retirement a year later of Justice Lewis Powell promised an ideological sea change on the divided high court. Powell was a centrist and the court's key swing vote. The Reagan White House quickly focused on Bork, hoping it would move the court to the right.
One major roadblock: Unlike the Scalia confirmation a year earlier, Democrats now controlled the Senate and were prepared for a fight. Bork's confirmation was the most bitter Washington had seen in years, and he was ultimately rejected by the Senate 58-42, the largest margin of defeat ever for a court nominee.
From Robert Bork to Instagram in 7 steps
The concern for many senators was not one of qualification but of temperament. Bork's paper trail was extensive. He was an outspoken and prolific jurist with a clear, unapologetic conservative record. Civil rights groups and liberal lawmakers attacked his writings and rulings on voting, free speech and, especially, on reproductive rights.
"Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution," Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, said at the time. "The doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens."
Robert Bork was one of the most influential legal scholars of the past 50 years.Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia
During the nationally televised hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Bork sparred with lawmakers, strongly defending his "originalist" judicial philosophy and rejecting suggestions the Constitution was a "flexible" document that offered new rights in changing political and social times.
Bork believed in "strict constructionalism," that judges should rule based only on the text of the Constitution as it was originally enacted, and should not be seen as righting all social ills.
In 2005, Bork told CNN's "Larry King Live" what made a good justice: "A willingness to apply the Constitution according to the principles that are actually in it rather than what they call the 'evolving' or the 'living' Constitution," he said, "which simply means the judges begin to make it up."
Friends and colleagues offered tributes to the conservative legal icon.
"Robert Bork was one of America's greatest jurists and a brilliant legal mind," said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a onetime constitutional lawyer and friend of the judge. "He was an expert on issues ranging from antitrust to privacy laws and was deeply influential in promoting constitutional originalism. Despite the unfortunate and unnecessary controversy surrounding his Supreme Court nomination, Judge Bork remained an inspirational figure for those seeking to enforce constitutional limits on the federal government. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Bork family."
That political fight raised the stakes for future Supreme Court nominations, bringing a new level of intensity and partisanship to the process. Groups on both sides of the ideological debate saw advantages in pointing out the impact the high court and its nine justices have on the rule of law and the hot-button issues decided.
The Supreme Court in June made a landmark opinion, upholding the sweeping health care reform law championed by President Obama. Rulings on affirmative action, voting rights and same-sex marriage can be expected by next June.
Justices order another look at key health care provision
Years after the political fight, Bork admitted that the partisan rejection of his nomination was personally trying. He had stepped down from the bench a year after it.
Bork suffered in past years with heart disease. Before his death, he was a distinguished fellow at the Hudson Institute, which researches and analyzes issues involving defense policy, international relations, health care, technology culture and law.
The foundation's president and CEO, Kenneth Weinstein, said Bork will be missed.
"Robert Bork was a giant, a brilliant and fearless legal scholar, and a gentleman whose incredible wit and erudition made him a wonderful Hudson colleague," Weinstein said in a statement on the organization's website.

Fiscal cliff winners and losers
By John Helton, CNN
updated 2:56 PM EST, Wed January 2, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Biden and McConnell lauded for their ability to work together on deal
Obama sticks to his guns on deal -- for the most part
Boehner takes some licks in fiscal cliff drama
Congressional Republicans criticized for threatening deal
Washington (CNN) -- Congress went beyond the edge of the fiscal cliff to get a deal done in back-to-back, late-night sessions to avert a financial crisis, or at least to put it off for a couple months. Here are winners and losers in the deal:
Winners
Vice President Joe Biden: This might not have been the "Big f***ing deal" that he proclaimed the passage of Obamacare to be, but it was a pretty big deal. Biden used his years of experience cutting deals in the Senate to work out a compromise with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He used the same playbook in the first extension of the Bush-era tax cuts in 2010 and the debt ceiling fight in 2011, walking through the proposal with progressives in the Senate and then the House to bring them in line.
Then he went and got a sandwich.
Biden hasn't ruled out a run for the White House when Obama's second term is up and his role in this deal makes a President Biden believable.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell: He found the "dance partner" he was looking for in Biden and skillfully worked behind the scenes with the vice president to broker a deal that got overwhelming Republican support in the Senate.
It's too early to tell whether McConnell will pay the price with hard-line conservatives at home in Kentucky who have already shown that they can oust Senate incumbents who anger them by working with Democrats. No real Republican opponent has emerged in his re-election race in 2014 but they mobilized two years ago to elect Rand Paul to the Senate over McConnell's hand-picked candidate.
Inside the deal
Obama thanks Biden for 'great work'
Focus needs to be on avoiding downgrades
Psaki: Fiscal cliff 'package is good'
President Barack Obama: White House insiders say he learned lessons in his first term and would be a tougher negotiator in his second. He didn't get the big deal that he set out for and some progressives think that he gave too much away, but getting Republican votes to raise taxes on the wealthy is significant. And he did pick Biden to be his vice president.
The wealthy: Despite higher taxes, it could have been a lot worse.
The unemployed: Another year of benefits for those actively looking for work.
Five things to know about the fiscal cliff
Losers
The employed: The two-year payroll tax holiday is over, so take-home pay will go down -- around $2,000 less a year for the average wage earner as the rate went from 4.2% to 6.2%. But ending the tax holiday will add about $120 billion to federal coffers.
House Speaker John Boehner: He had to pull his "Plan B" back from the floor when it became clear that he didn't have the Republican votes for passage and then had to sit back and watch McConnell make a deal with Biden. On Tuesday, he was reduced to dodging microphones and listening to conservative members vent about the deal that was forced on them. While weakened, Boehner's standing appears safe, though. Really, who would want this job?
House Republicans: Could their reputation get any worse? First, they publicly threaten the deal passed by the Senate to up the anxiety for the nation on New Year's Day. And then they cave when the votes to add spending cuts to that proposal never materialized. Finally, they tell Superstorm Sandy victims waiting for more help from Washington to wait longer -- pushing back a vote on an aid package.
A grand bargain: Have you seen anything that makes you think these guys get a long-term deal done to address the real crisis on the debt ceiling a few more weeks down the road?
The can: That poor sucker gets a couple more dents and a few more scuffs as it gets kicked down the road again.

Married at 13 to man in his 70s: Child bride who's changing attitudes
By Mereso Kilusu, Special to CNN
updated 7:01 AM EST, Fri March 8, 2013
Child marriage is common in traditional Maasai communities in Tanzania, says Mereso Kilusu.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Mereso Kilusu was a child bride. Now she campaigns against child marriage Changing attitudes in traditional communities is key, says Kilusu
'We need to talk to families about how girls can contribute to their livelihoods,' she says
Report: Nine of the 10 countries with the world's highest rates of child marriage are in Africa
Editor's note: Tanzanian Mereso Kilusu was a child bride and is now an activist against child marriage. Her story was translated by LoeRose Mbise, of YWCA Tanzania, and edited by Marlee Wasser, of The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health.
(CNN) -- Nine of the 10 countries with the world's highest rates of child marriage are in Africa: Niger, Chad and Central African Republic, Guinea, Mozambique, Mali, Burkina Faso and South Sudan, and Malawi.
My country, Tanzania, did not make the list. But in traditional Maasai communities like mine, marrying off girls is very common.
I was married at 13 to a man in his 70s.
Mereso Kilusu
It happened during Christmas break. My father told my school that I had died. Even if he hadn't, I would have been forced to leave when I got pregnant because that was the law at the time.
I gave birth to my first child within a year. I had no professional prenatal care and no trained medical assistance during delivery. I had to depend on my husband and his other wives for guidance. It was a very painful experience. Every time I became pregnant after that I felt sick and scared. Because of all these difficult births I have a hard time controlling my bladder and it can be painful to urinate.
Today, I am a mother of five at 29 years old.
International Women's Day: Whose words inspire you?
Our traditional values dictate girls are meant for marriage, and when the men decide we are biologically ready, we are married.Mereso Kilusu
In communities like mine, age is not understood as a number. Our traditional values dictate girls are meant for marriage, and when the men decide we are biologically ready, we are married.
Marriage is sometimes a way of forming and cementing relationships. But it is also a way of earning money.
My family received a bride price from my husband and then he took me away to become one of his wives. He beat me regularly, and so I fled back to my village. But my father and brother told me the price had been paid, this was no longer my home, I had to return.
It wasn't until six years ago that I was able to take charge of my own destiny.
I ran away to the city of Arusha and met Rebecca, a volunteer with the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). Through counseling, workshops and friendship, I gained more confidence in my own voice and learned to support myself.
Child brides: A global problem
Battle against child bride kidnappings
Child bride: I was sold for $1,000
When I returned to my village, I found an ally: one of our community leaders, named Abraham. In his own extended family girls were running away from forced marriages. He felt obliged to support them by giving them shelter and food. Quietly, he was encouraging them to go to school hoping it would be a way to get girls out of their situation.
When he learned about how I was able to find support from YWCA he was inspired. Knowing there would be places for girls to go outside their communities helped convince him they would be OK if they left their marriages.
But I love my family and my community, and I didn't want leaving to be the answer. So I set up a YWCA in my village and slowly, change is happening.
Some men and boys are not happy with what I'm doing. I have to be around others all the time to protect myself from harassment. I don't know if my own father would approve if he were still alive.
But many are recognizing that this is the way forward -- that girls have value beyond marriage. That we can earn money and contribute more to our communities when we stay in school.

My brother used to think I was wrong to leave my husband. But seeing how well I am doing selling traditional Maasai jewelry and clothing he is starting to respect my choice. He no longer beats me, but he still won't let me have access to any of my father's farms. Thankfully, I have supporters in my community who help give me other options to grow food for my children. I believe my relationship with my brother will get better with time. I am still working on it.
My mother is so proud. She used to fear my disobedience to my husband would reflect poorly on her and she would be cast out of the community. But now she sees I am welcome and respected and she is so happy to have me back in her life.
In the fight against child marriage, the biggest battle is finding those who are ready for change and giving them the courage to speak to others.Mereso Kilusu
When attitudes begin to shift from within communities this way, then people start to have hope. And politicians gain more courage to act. Without support from community leaders, parliamentarians fear passing laws will cost them votes and they will lose power to make any difference at all.
Likewise, passing laws provides no guarantee girls will be protected unless they have community support: 158 countries have set the legal age for marriage at 18 years but the laws are simply ignored by communities where marrying children and adolescent girls is common practice.
In the fight against child marriage, the biggest battle is finding those who are ready for change and giving them the courage to speak to others.
Those of us who believe in the power of girls, who have seen what they can do when they have options, we need to tell everyone we can. We need to teach girls that it's OK to say no to marrying before they are ready, and that there are places they can go if they have to run away.
We need to talk to families about different ways their girls can contribute to their livelihoods, so that marriage is not seen as the only option.
We need to show community leaders examples of girls who have stayed in school, learned skills, and have helped develop their local economies.
We need to convince politicians that they should pass laws to protect and empower girls, and that the people will support them if they do.
And we need to share our success stories with the world. Because people need to know we are fighting for change and they can join us in their own countries and communities.
Change is possible when we believe in each other. I am living proof.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mereso Kilusu.

Kerry-Lavrov statements called 'first hopeful news' on Syria in a while
By CNN Staff
updated 12:51 PM EDT, Thu May 9, 2013
US Secretary of State John Kerry (left) and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on May 7, 2013. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Activist says Hezbollah fighters shot and killed civilians fleeing town
In other fighting, a jihadist leader was injured
Lavrov and Kerry say they will seek to convene a conference
Brahimi calls their statements "a significant step forward"
Read a version of this story in Arabic. (CNN) -- The U.N. and Arab League point man on Syria praised the top U.S. and Russian diplomats Wednesday for their latest efforts to forge a solution to the Syrian conflict.
Lakhdar Brahimi called remarks from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry "the first hopeful news concerning that unhappy country in a very long time."
Speaking at a joint news conference Tuesday in Moscow, Kerry said he and Lavrov had agreed "as soon as is practicable, possibly and hopefully, by the end of this month" to "seek to convene an international conference."
The aim would be to implement last summer's Geneva communique brokered by Russia and the United States outlining how a transitional government could be formed.

Syria's internally displaced
If the conference takes place, it would be the first to bring together representatives of the warring sides, which have been unable to negotiate a settlement to the two-year conflict that has claimed more than 70,000 lives.
The opposition has adamantly refused any role for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in any transitional government. But Lavrov, without naming al-Assad, said he is "not interested in the fate of certain persons."
Kerry went further by telling reporters that "it's impossible for me, as an individual, to understand how Syria could be governed in the future by the man who has committed the things we know have taken place."
"But I'm not going to decide that tonight. I'm not going to decide that in the end. Because the Geneva communique says that the transitional government has to be chosen by mutual consent by the parties ... the current regime and the opposition," Kerry said.
Brahimi said he has urged the United States and Russia "to exercise leadership and work together to initiate a process to implement" the June 30 Geneva declaration.
"The statements made in Moscow constitute a very significant first step forward. It is nevertheless only a first step," Brahimi said in a prepared statement. "There is every reason to expect the three other permanent members of the Security Council as a whole and indeed all the Security Council members to work together amongst themselves and with the secretary-general to carry the process forward."
Deaths continue to mount, as 112 people were killed across Syria Wednesday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees said, including 30 in the Qusair area of Homs, in what the group said was a "massacre by Lebanese Hezbollah forces."
A Syrian activist in Qusair who spoke with eight survivors of the attack said that Hezbollah fighters attacked civilian vehicles that were trying to flee the city.
Activist Hadi Albadalla said the Syrian regime and Hezbollah have had Qusair under siege for 20 days. Residents have witnessed increased shelling and tank artillery fire, Albadalla said.
The victims were trying to flee in four vehicles when they were spotted by Hezbollah militants and fired upon, Albadalla said. Many of those who escaped were found and killed, he said.
In other fighting Wednesday, the leader for the hardline jihadist group al-Nusra Front, Abu Mohammed al-Joulani, was injured during shelling in a southern suburb of Damascus, the London based activist group, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said. An activist in the area told the group that several members of the al-Nusra Front were also injured in the shelling which targeted them. The U.S. State Department designates the al-Nusra Front rebel group as a terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq.

Authorities: Freezing weather leaves 19 dead in U.S., Canada
By Jason Hanna and Ben Brumfield, CNN
updated 8:34 PM EST, Thu December 26, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Authorities say 14 people died in the United States and five in Canada since Saturday
232,000-plus customers without power in Michigan, Canada, New England
Electrical grids are rapidly recovering, but crews are working against the ice
Christmas took on new meaning for some at Red Cross shelters

(CNN) -- Thousands of people in parts of the northern United States and southeastern Canada endured at least their fourth consecutive day without electricity Thursday because of ice-related outages, and power companies warned some still might not have power until at least the weekend.
More than 232,000 customers were without power in below-freezing temperatures Thursday in parts of Michigan, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and northern New England. Storms that began hitting Michigan on Saturday and moved through New England early this week knocked down trees and power lines, leaving hundreds of thousands in the dark.
At least 19 people died in weather-related incidents since Saturday, authorities said Thursday.
Of the casualties, 14 were in the United States, according to various emergency management officials. The majority died of carbon monoxide poisoning, the officials said.
In Kentucky, five people died in flooding-related incidents, state officials said.
In Canada, three people in Quebec and two in Toronto died from carbon monoxide poisoning, official said.
In areas near Toronto, where officials said the storm was one of the worst to hit the city, more than 54,000 were without power Thursday. While that's down from 300,000 at the peak, utility officials there declined to estimate when the last outages would be fixed.
"It's taking long because we haven't seen a storm like this in our history," Toronto Hydro spokeswoman Tanya Bruckmueller told CNN affiliate CBC News. "The amount of damage to both our equipment due to the trees coming down is slowing us down, as well as this morning we've got snow coming, which is much heavier on the branches and is now covering a lot of what we need to be repairing."
Toronto resident Vic Baniuk told CBC on Thursday that his family hasn't had power for five days, and they were using a fireplace and a cast-iron stove to stay warm.
"We're sitting in the dark and cold, and I feel that everybody has ignored us," he told CBC.
A tree branch pierced his roof, making a bad situation worse.
"This is not an inconvenience. This is an emergency, a disaster," CBC reported Baniuk said.
Light snow might fall Thursday night and Friday morning in Toronto, where the temperature was -2 C (28 F) around 3 p.m. The temperature isn't expected to get above freezing until Saturday, with a high of 3 C (37 F) possible.
Another 16,000 people were without power Thursday elsewhere in southern Ontario; 20,500 had no electricity in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, and another 8,900 still had outages in Quebec province, utility companies said.
The Hyrdo-Quebec utility estimated that about 2,000 of its customers in Quebec, mostly in rural areas, would not get power back until Friday.
Power to the people
Power crews were working around the clock and called in reinforcements from other states to help them wrangle electric lines back into place.
They have made progress. Of the 470,000 customers left in the dark and cold earlier in the week in Michigan, all but 100,000 had electricity restored by Thursday morning, according to two utilities.
High temperatures sat in the mid-20s around much of lower Michigan on Thursday. Ice could finally start melting Saturday, when temperatures could reach the high 30s or lower 40s.
Michigan utility Consumers Energy warned the melting might not be all good news -- it might snap more tree branches and send them crashing into power lines, causing more outages.
Consumers Energy said it expected to have most of the outages fixed by the end of Saturday.
Utility crews have had to work against icebox weather conditions this week. One utility truck flipped over on a Michigan interstate Wednesday, as a dozen cars and trucks wiped out on the same patch of ice, CNN affiliate WOOD reported.
About 600 customers had no power in parts of Vermont on Thursday morning. Roughly 30,000 people still were without electricity in Maine.
With no power in her Litchifield, Maine, home on Wednesday afternoon, Mary Beth King cooked her family's Christmas dinner -- seafood chowder -- on an outdoor grill, CNN affiliate WGME reported.
King's husband spent part of Christmas looking for a replacement for a generator that failed on Tuesday night.
"We do have a wood stove in the basement, which is wonderful, so it keeps the house warm. So we're lucky for that," she told WGME.
'Room at the inn'
The storm clouds had a silver lining for some who lost power. They found generosity and new friends after turning to shelters to stay warm.
More than 200 people took refuge Thursday in Red Cross shelters in Michigan and Maine, according to the relief group's online shelter tracker.
"Friends and family." That's how Bonnie Libby described her shelter mates to WOOD after living with them for three days.
The outage was a cure for loneliness on Christmas Day for Larry Sutherland. "I would be spending it alone, and my Christmas dinner would be a microwave meal," he said.
On Christmas Eve, power crews put the lights back on at the house of Dennis and Daisy Davis, but Christmas at home no longer felt right, and they returned to the Red Cross Shelter.
"I think it is just all the people pulling together," Daisy Davis told WOOD. "I think it is the true meaning of Christmas."
Bonita Thomas wanted to host her grandchildren in her Flint-area apartment for Christmas, but falling trees cut the power to her building on Monday, and she began to shiver.
She wrapped herself in layers. But when temperatures fell to the single digits, it was too much -- she called her grandkids' father, told them to stay home, and she went to a Red Cross shelter.
Thomas was sad that she couldn't host her grandchildren, but she's grateful for the room and board, she told CNN.
"It's kind of depressing, but I just believe ... that God's still on my side. And there's room at the inn."
