Moscow's growing influence over NATOStory Highlights NATO members increasingly preoccupied by Russian attitude towards alliance NATO divided over whether ex-Soviet states of Ukraine, Georgia should be admitted France, Germany argue move would upset balance of power Georgia says that amounts to giving Moscow a veto over NATO membership Next Article in World » By CNN European Political Editor Robin Oakley	BUCHAREST, Romania (CNN) -- Russia isn't a member of NATO. It never will be. But the country which once used to dominate and run the rival Warsaw Pact is nevertheless having a crucial influence on the deliberations in Bucharest of the 26-nation alliance. Whether western powers like it or not, Russia is becoming NATO-Plus-One. Russian President Vladimir Putin has increased his country's influence over Nato. The thing Vladimir Putin has hated most in his political life is the decline of the old Soviet Union and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. He believes that his bibulous predecessor Boris Yeltsin effectively "gave away the shop" in the 1990s. But the now retiring president (and soon-to-be prime minister to his successor Dmitry Medvedev) would be delighted how often the phrase, "But how will Russia react?" comes up in behind the scenes discussions both in NATO and the European Union. On the enlargement of NATO, on Kosovo, on the United States missile defense plan, it is for many NATO states -- especially those heavily dependent on Russian gas and oil supplies -- a constantly repeated question. Putin's aim throughout his years in the Kremlin has been to restore what he sees as Russia's rightful place at all the top tables, an ambition in which he has been aided enormously by Russia's growth as an energy producer. Russia's president is less concerned, some diplomats say, with what the superpower United States actually does than with being seen as its equal in determining the outcome of world events. And this NATO summit is a clear measurement of how far he has succeeded. When Bush calls for the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Georgia to be admitted to Membership Action Plans, putting them on the track towards admission into the alliance as a reward for their progress in building democracy, the reaction of France and Germany is that this would be a step too far in upsetting the balance of power. Don't Miss Nato chief: More Afghan troops likely
Already nervous of furious Russian reactions over the U.S. missile defense plan, which involves the installation of bases in Poland and the Czech Republic, they have made clear they don't reckon it worth upsetting the Kremlin further on this issue. In effect, say potentially disappointed suitors like Georgia's President Mikhail Saakashvili, they are handing Russia a veto on NATO membership. If NATO does not resist the Russian warnings that launching a NATO membership process for Ukraine and Georgia would create a "security crisis," they argue, then Putin is still being allowed to rule over the now sovereign countries in his "near abroad." Even Bush used most of the words he devoted to missile defense in a keynote address in Bucharest to underline that the plan is not intended as a threat to Russia. "The missile defense capabilities we are developing are not designed to defend against Russia, just as the new NATO we are building is not designed to defend against Russia. The Cold War is over. Russia is not our enemy. We are working toward a new security relationship with Russia whose foundation does not rest on the prospect of mutual annihilation." Russia, of course, sees it differently. It fears the missile sites could be turned into offensive weapon sites. In consequence, to the alarm of some NATO members, it has scrapped an agreement on conventional force levels in Europe and threatened to target missiles on countries which house missile defense installations for the U.S. Bush will have the chance to talk head to head with President Putin for the last time while they are both presidents at the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Sunday. The other NATO heads will also see Putin. For the first time since the foundation of the Russia-NATO Council in 2002, he is turning up to their meeting here in Bucharest on Thursday. They have been intrigued to learn from the Russian media that despite his anger over missile defense and over Bush's appeal to the NATO members to give MAP status to Georgia and Ukraine, despite his shipping this week of "humanitarian supplies" to Serbs in Kosovo, Putin is planning to accentuate the positive in Bucharest. They hope that means he will give a Russian say-so to the transportation of supplies for the 47,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan across Russian territory. If he does, it will be a breakthrough, but of course one which would once again underline the importance of listening to what Moscow has to say.

Kashmir leader quits over sex scandal claimsStory Highlights Chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir tenders his resignation Omar Abdullah accused of being involved in a 2006 sex scandal He denies allegation he was involved in a prostitution ringNext Article in World » By Mukhtar Amad CNN	SRINAGAR, Indian-administered Kashmir (CNN) -- The chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir tendered his resignation Tuesday after he was accused of being involved in a 2006 sex scandal, his adviser said. Omar Abdullah denies any link to a prostitution ring, saying he has stepped down to clear his name. Omar Abdullah, 38, delivered his resignation to the state governor after opposition member Muzaffar Hussain Beigh accused Omar of a connection to the prostitution scandal during a session of the state legislative assembly. Muzaffar served as the deputy chief minister in the previous government, when several top pro-India officials were arrested on charges they misused their authority to force girls and women into a prostitution ring in Kashmir. Omar denied being involved in the scandal, but said he could not "continue in the office following the allegation" and would not serve again until he is cleared of the charges. "This is not an ordinary allegation, but a highly serious one. I cannot continue in office until I am cleared," Omar said in the state assembly. He then drove to Raj Bhawan, the official residence of New Delhi-appointed governor N. N. Vohra, to deliver his resignation, according to Devender Rana, Omar's political adviser. The governor is consulting constitutional and legal experts before deciding on the resignation. The chief minister refused to talk to journalists outside the governor's residence. The Times of India newspaper Tuesday quoted highly placed sources in India's Central Bureau of Investigation as saying that Omar's name never came up in the prostitution probe. Omar came into office in January following elections in late 2008 that saw the highest voter turnout in the region in nearly 20 years, since the eruption of a secessionist insurgency. Voters went to the polls in large numbers, despite a separatist call for a boycott of the voting. Most recently, the chief minister has been working to defuse tensions that are still running high following the arrest of four police officers in the probe of the alleged rape and murder of two young Muslim women in May. Two people have died and many have been injured in more than 300 violent clashes between Muslim protesters and Indian security forces stemming from the case. The arrests included the former police chief of south Kashmir's Shopian district and three of his subordinates, who are accused of "destruction of evidence" and "dereliction of duty" in connection with the deaths, which occurred in the town of Shopian. Kashmir has been in the throes of a bloody secessionist campaign for nearly two decades in which, according to official figures, 43,000 people have been killed. Various rights groups and non-governmental organizations here, however, dispute the official statistics -- claiming that the number killed during the last two decades is twice the official figure.

Mexican drug violence claims 24 lives in 24 hours By Nick Valencia, CNN Many of the recent drug-related slayings in the Mexican state of Chihuahua have occurred in public places. STORY HIGHLIGHTSKillings scattered over four locations throughout Mexican state of ChihuahuaAll the slayings occurred in public places, including a barViolence result of battle between two cartels, said attorney general's spokesman

(CNN) -- Drug violence in the Mexican state of Chihuahua left 24 people dead in the span of 24 hours this weekend, the state attorney general's office said Sunday. The killings were scattered over four locations throughout the state, with eight dead in Juarez, 10 killed in the capital of Chihuahua, five killed in Cuauhtemuc and one killed in Parral. All the slayings occurred in public places, with the killings in Cuauhtemuc occurring in a bar, said Carlos Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general. The killings took place between Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning, Gonzalez said. The victims -- all male -- ranged in age between 18 and 25 years old. No other details about the killings or the victims were immediately available. "This is an indicator of the incrementally increasing war between the two cartels battling for Juarez Plaza, the state's drug trafficking corridor," Gonzalez said, referring to an ongoing battle between the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels for dominance in the area. Juarez Plaza is a major thoroughfare through the area. "I can't give you a reason why the violence is picking up the last week of April going into this month," Gonzalez added. Some Mexican news organizations have reported that the Sinaloa Cartel had defeated the rival Juarez organization but Gonzalez said, "There is no winner to this war." The spate of weekend killings followed another bloody week in the Ciudad Juarez area. On Wednesday, at least 15 people were killed in drug-related violence in Juarez, authorities said. The slayings included four people whose bodies were found at one location, another three -- one of them a woman -- who were found slain at a second location, and another eight victims who were killed at a bar, police spokesman Jacinto Seguro said. On Tuesday, 10 people were killed, Seguro said, including three who were shot outside a supermarket. Another victim was killed outside a shopping mall. In all, 25 people were killed between Tuesday and Wednesday, Seguro said. Ciudad Juarez is the most violent city in Mexico, with more than 2,600 drug-related deaths in 2009. No official numbers are available for this year, but more than 500 killings have been reported by local media. Some reports have the figures as high as 810 in Juarez this year. According to a report released in April by the Mexican government, Chihuahua state is Mexico's hardest-hit state by drug violence, with 6,757 people killed since the start of the drug war at the end of 2006.

Attacks kill 7 Yemeni troops, officials say From Hakim Almasmari, For CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSSuspected al Qaeda militants fired on a military checkpoint, Yemeni officials saySecurity officials also reported an attack in a neighboring province (CNN) -- At least seven Yemeni troops have been killed in two attacks in the southern part of the country, Yemeni officials said Friday. In one attack, suspected al Qaeda militants fired on a military checkpoint, killing three soldiers and wounding seven others, officials with Yemen's central security agency said. The officials declined to give their names, as is custom. The gunmen were shouting "Allahu Akbar" -- "Allah is greatest" -- witnesses told CNN. The militants targeted about 20 troops with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenades, the officials said, citing an account from one of the wounded soldiers. That attack happened in Abyan province, which has been the scene of attacks against military camps, security checkpoints and other government targets. Authorities have blamed al Qaeda and separatists. The second attack happened in neighboring Lahj province, where an officer and three soldiers were killed and four injured, officials at a security committee in that province said. They also declined to be named, following custom. The state-run Saba news agency also reported that an officer and three soldiers were killed in the attack, citing "an official source."

Internet mocks Bravo's 'Silicon Valley' By Brandon Griggs, CNN
updated 1:32 PM EDT, Tue October 9, 2012 | Filed under: Innovations
Entrepreneurs chill poolside in Bravo's "Start-Ups: Silicon Valley," because, you know ... that's how startups get built.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Bravo posted promo clip for upcoming show about budding tech entrepreneurs
The preview shows its stars lounging poolside, doing shots and going to toga parties
"Start-Ups: Silicon Valley" premieres November 5 (CNN) -- Stop us if you've heard this before: Tech geeks are the new rock stars. Silicon Valley is a "hotbed of innovation." And some people who work in tech aren't nerdy.
These nuggets of insight, and much more, are on display in a new preview video for an upcoming reality series, "Start-Ups: Silicon Valley," which premieres November 5 on Bravo.
The show promises to follow six budding tech entrepreneurs as they try to market their ideas, launch companies and get really, really rich. But Bravo is not interested in watching engineers code.
Instead, the clip shows its young, attractive stars lounging poolside, rock climbing, doing shots, going to toga parties and boasting about their " 'work hard, play hard' mentality."
There's no mention of what products, if any, they've created.
But the promo does pack an impressive number of clichés and tangled metaphors into its 2 minutes, 21 seconds. Among the better ones:
• "This is the moment we have to up our game even more than ever."
• "The future of the world is in our hands, and we're not sitting back and letting it pass us by."
• "Silicon Valley is just balls to the wall. It's not something you do if you don't want to roll the dice."
Then there's the young woman who motions to her face and says, "People have been intimidated, because this package generally doesn't come with a brain."
Shockingly, the Internet has not been kind.
"If you watch the latest promo for Bravo's Silicon Valley reality show and think, hey these entrepreneurs failed actors are just stringing together tech buzzwords, it's because that's exactly what they're doing," writes Gizmodo. "This show looks awful, but we'd be lying if we said we weren't going to watch Start-Ups ... with glee/horror."
The video trailer has a rating of two out of five stars -- on Bravo's own website. A commenter on the show's Facebook page says, "You focused on an exception not the rule and in the process you disrespect most of Silicon Valley."
And on Twitter, TechCrunch co-editor Alexa Tsotsis quipped, "Here Comes Silicon Valley Boo Boo."
The TV show has a respectable pedigree: It's co-produced by Randi Zuckerberg, former marketing director of Facebook and sister of its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. But early observers still give the promo low marks for authenticity.
"Dang! Real SV women sure don't look like that in the show. Well for that matter the men either," wrote one commenter on Gizmodo. "Sadly, Asian people apparently don't exist in the Hollywood version of Silicon Valley. No Indians either. Weird alternate universe indeed."
Our clever cousins at CNNMoney recommend that viewers turn the show into a drinking game in which they do a shot every time a "business development session" is held poolside and "swill the whole bottle when someone actually writes a line of code."

Woman busted in Spain for cocaine in breast implants
By Ben Brumfield, CNN
updated 7:18 AM EST, Thu December 13, 2012
A woman was arrested in the El Prat airport in Spain for carrying cocaine in her breast implants.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The suspect landed on a "hot flight" to Barcelona from Bogota, Colombia Her story just didn't sound right to border agents
A pat-down revealed blood-stained bandage material
A hospital removed breast implants full of cocaine
Read a version of this story in Arabic.
(CNN) -- She arrived on a suspicious flight. Her story didn't sound right. And then there was the blood ... under her breasts.
An airport security check in Spain led to an operating table for a passenger -- where, authorities said, they found she had tucked packs of cocaine in her breast implants.
The Panamanian citizen landed at Barcelona's Prat airport on a so-called "hot flight," one that came from a destination known for drug trafficking -- in this case Bogota, Colombia.
Ninety percent of cocaine trafficked into the United States, for example, comes from Colombia, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
The passenger came under the scrutiny of security agents, who weren't satisfied with the vague answers she kept giving about why she was in town, Spain's interior ministry said.
Her behavior aroused the suspicion of officers that she might be carrying drugs either in her luggage or on her.
When a female officer patted down the woman, she found bloodied bandage material under the passenger's breasts. The gauze, the officer found, was covering incisions. And the breasts were hiding "a white foreign material."
Fresh breast implants, the suspect mustered an explanation. Must not have healed up right.
The story didn't convince police, who hauled her off to a hospital.
"There, a medical team extracted a bag-shaped prosthesis from each breast containing a white pasty substance," the ministry said.
Cocaine. Nearly 1.4 kilograms (3 lbs) of it.
Pure cocaine goes for about $35,000 a pound, according to the DEA.
The expensive implants landed her in jail.
CNN's Helena DeMoura contributed to this report.

Finding God on your travels By Maureen Jenkins, Special to CNN
updated 5:21 PM EST, Tue January 22, 2013
It's important to be respectful whether you're participating in or observing a religious service.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Attending a religious service away from home gives visitors a look at local ritual
Even if you don't share the faith, being respectful and curious goes a long way
Ask people you know if you can join them for a religious service
Sit in the back and follow along, religion experts advise
(CNN) -- World-class museums and historic monuments get top priority from many travelers. But for some of us, there's something equally fascinating -- and sometimes much more so -- about visiting houses of worship, even when they represent beliefs that aren't our own.
"But I'm not into organized religion," you might say. You don't have to be religious to appreciate a visit to a place others consider sacred. Even if you're not specifically seeking the religious aspect of worship, there's something special about thoughtfully witnessing and observing someone else's faith in action. So why not get a spiritual boost by checking out houses of worship when you're on the road?
"A lot of the richness in life comes from getting outside your own skin and experiencing the world beyond what you know and understand. If you open yourself up, you can have such experiences," says Stuart M. Matlins, co-editor with Arthur J. Magida of "How to Be a Perfect Stranger: The Essential Religious Etiquette Handbook." The book shares easy-to-understand background on faith traditions ranging from Baptist to Buddhist, Jewish to Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-Day Adventists to Sikhs.
"Typically, the way you are received depends on the way you behave," says Matlins, who also is the founder of Jewish Lights Publishing and SkyLight Paths Publishing. He and wife, Antoinette, co-founded a Reform synagogue in Woodstock, Vermont, where Matlins served as lay spiritual leader for 19 years.
"I've never found a place where I was not welcome. The larger the place, the more likely they are to be welcoming of strangers, whether it's a mosque, a synagogue or a church. That's why I did this book -- if you know the basics of what's going to happen during the worship or the ritual, you're less fearful of embarrassing yourself and intruding in the space of others."
When I'm traveling abroad -- but also when I'm visiting American cities -- I often get up on Sunday mornings and attend some Christian service. I enjoy the religious aspect of worship, but it's also about savoring local culture in one of its most authentic forms. And when you're on the road alone, as I often am, these communal experiences offer the solo traveler a sense of belonging for an hour or two.
When previous reporting jobs took me to Manhattan, I'd go uptown to Harlem to visit Abyssinian Baptist Church, one of the nation's oldest African-American Baptist congregations. And I was hardly alone. Every week, groups of tourists from around the world do the same -- but in such huge numbers that the church specifically addresses first-time visitors by making clear its worship "is not a gospel performance or entertainment of any kind."
Abyssinian now has a tourist entry point where folks must queue for first-come, first-served seats at its 11 a.m. service only. And tourist or not, tank tops, flip-flops and shorts are not allowed.
What's most important to remember, says Matlins, is that even though you're a tourist, visiting a functioning house of worship is not just like walking through a museum.
Regardless of the place's faith tradition, he says, "You're sharing a very special moment with people, and be aware of that. The key thing is to open yourself to the experience so you are not just an observer, even though you are not a participant. You enter a space where you're not participant or tourist, but as one might say, you're in the moment."
But how do you know if worshippers at, say, a Muslim mosque or a Buddhist or Hindu temple will welcome you?
Francis X. Clooney, the director of the Center for the Study of World Religions at Harvard, has found Hindu temples to be fluid places where "smaller and larger rites" take place during the day, not always according to a fixed schedule. But if one is welcomed in, usually one is welcomed for the worship that is in progress."
When in doubt, he suggests "checking in advance, or at least at the door before entering."
Adds Matlins: "If you know people who live in that place, ask them if they can take you to their house of worship, or where they know you would be welcome. I did that in Lahore, Pakistan. I had the same concerns, but we were meeting with someone who was a very religiously involved Muslim.
"I told him of my interest in attending service at a mosque. He said he would be happy to take me." But Matlins has also wandered alone into a Hindu temple in Singapore and Buddhist temples in Japan, which many tourists do.
Of course, it never hurts to do some research before you go, checking out books and websites that offer insight into the cultures and faith traditions you hope to see up close.
For folks seeking out Christian experiences close to home or on the other side of the world, the Mystery Worshipper website offers about 2,000 candid, sometimes tongue-in-cheek reviews of church services around the globe. Its volunteer mystery worshippers drop in and serve up details on everything from sermon length to the comfort of the pews to the warmth of members' welcome.
And it's the friendliness-factor details that give travelers a measure of comfort and behind-the-scenes intel when visiting these places, from massive St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City to the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in Fiji.
Curious, open-minded travelers also shouldn't let their lack of a personal faith stop them from dropping into houses of worship.
"They don't have to be a gourmet to appreciate a good meal," Matlins reasons. "And you don't have to be a person of faith to appreciate the beauty and passion of a religious experience. It is in a way like theater -- part of the experience is to suspend disbelief, literally."
Thinking about stopping into a living, breathing house of worship on your next trip? Matlins and Clooney suggest keeping these things in mind, regardless of the place's faith tradition:
Be respectful. "You are in a place that is special and holy to other people," Matlins says. "Dress and behave appropriately so you do not disturb their sense of the specialness and holiness of the place."
Pay attention. You want to "be sensitive to what is expected of the visitor -- either to hold back, or to participate more fully," says Clooney. "Being too forward or too passive may both be offensive." Also, "be careful to note where and how far into the space one is welcome. Some areas are more sacred than others."
Follow along. Observe "the customs of the community -- removing shoes, covering heads, the segregation of men and women, talking or not, taking photos or not, in accord with custom," says Clooney.
Listen with your "third ear." "You may not understand the language," says Matlins, "but you can hear the feelings if you open yourself up to them."
Sit in the back. Not only does it keep you from appearing intrusive, but it can minimize any innocent missteps. Suggests Matlins: "Do what you see other people do, unless it violates the tenets of your own faith."
Who knows, perhaps through these spiritual experiences you'll discover what so many travelers find: Despite people's very real differences across nationalities, cultures and faiths, it's what they share in common that matters.

(CNN) -- Manchester United took another step towards a 20th English league title on Saturday with a battling 1-0 win against Fulham at Craven Cottage.
Wayne Rooney's 79th minute strike -- coolly side-footing home past Mark Schwarzer -- earned Alex Ferguson's side another vital three points away from home to extend their lead at the top of the table to 10 points with 13 games remaining.
Title rivals Manchester City play Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.
Chelsea's stuttering season continued with a 3-2 defeat at Newcastle United.
Demba Ba, who left the Magpies to join Chelsea in January, endured a miserable return to St James Park suffering a broken nose in a clash with Fabricio Coloccini towards the end of the first half.

Newcastle took the lead soon after -- Argentine midfielder Jonas Gutierrez heading home in 41st minute. But Chelsea hit back with a goal from Lampard in the 55th minute before Juan Mata added a second six minutes later.
But the lead didn't last long. Moussa Sissoko netted in the 68th minute before claiming the winner in stoppage time.
Newcastle's second successive league win sees them pull further away from the relegation zone with 27 points while Chelsea remain third with 46 points.
Lukas Podolski's 78th minute strike earned Arsenal a 1-0 win against Stoke City at the Emirates and close the gap on Everton and fourth-place Tottenham (who play West Bromwich Albion on Sunday) to a point.
West Ham United halted a recent poor run of form with a 1-0 win against Swansea City at Upton Park -- Andy Carroll heading home in the 77th minute to give the Hammers their first win in five league matches.
Reading moved up to 17th place and out of the relegation zone after a 2-1 win against Sunderland at the Madejski Stadium.
Jimmy Kebe scored twice to earn Brian McDermott's side a third win in four matches and leapfrog Aston Villa and Wigan who both drew on Saturday.
Paul Lambert's Villa had been 3-1 up against Everton at Goodison Park, before two goals from Marouane Fellaini -- the second in injury time -- rescued a point for the Toffees.
Wigan also left it late to claim a point against Southampton -- Shaun Maloney scoring for the Lactics in the 90th minute.
Queens Park Rangers played out a goalless draw with Norwich City to leave Harry Redknapp's four points adrift at the foot of the table.

(CNN) -- Nineteen firefighters were killed Sunday battling a blaze in Arizona, the state forestry division said.
The vast majority were from Prescott, said Wade Ward with the Prescott Fire Department.
State forestry official Art Morrison said the firefighters were members of a "hotshot" crew, tasked with digging a fire line and creating an escape route.
"In normal circumstances, when you're digging fire line, you make sure you have a good escape route, and you have a safety zone set up," Morrison said. "Evidently, their safety zone wasn't big enough, and the fire just overtook them."
The crew was fighting the Yarnell Hill fire, which broke out Friday northwest of Phoenix. The fire has grown to 1,000 acres, damaged three homes and forced the evacuations of residents in the communities of Peeples Valley and Yarnell, Morrison said.
Authorities believe lightning sparked the blaze.
Not including the 19 deaths reported in Arizona, there have been 43 firefighter fatalities reported so far in 2013, according to the U.S. Fire Administration. A total of 83 firefighters died last year while on duty.
A Facebook page in memory of the Arizona firefighters was created Sunday night.
People left their condolences and messages of support.
"Such a tragic loss. My heart aches for these brave souls, and for their families and friends," wrote one.
"I pray for the families and the town of Prescott. RIP," wrote another.

British court won't block man's extradition in 'honeymoon killing'
By Laura Smith-Spark, CNN
updated 7:36 AM EST, Fri January 31, 2014
Shrien Dewani, left, is accused of hiring hit men to kill his new bride in South Africa.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Shrien Dewani loses a High Court appeal to block his extradition to South Africa
He can be extradited as long as South Africa pledges to return him if he's not fit to stand trial
He's accused of orchestrating his wife's murder by hit men while they were on honeymoon
Anni Dewani was killed in Cape Town in November 2010
London (CNN) -- A British man accused of orchestrating his wife's murder by hit men while they were honeymooning in South Africa has lost a High Court appeal to block his extradition there until he is fit to stand trial.
The judges ruled that Shrien Dewani can be extradited as long as the South African government pledges to return him to the United Kingdom should he ultimately prove unfit to be tried.
Dewani's lawyers had argued that he should not be extradited while he was unfit to stand trial. He is being treated for post traumatic stress disorder and a depressive illness.
His legal team can appeal the decision at the Supreme Court.
Honeymoon murder case evidence revisited
Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hit men to kill his wife, Anni Dewani, 28, during a taxi ride in Cape Town in November 2010, just over two weeks after their wedding.
Taxi driver Zola Tongo confessed within weeks of the bride's death that he had hired two men to kill her.
In a plea deal with South African authorities, he said he was paid by Shrien Dewani to carry out the hit and to make it look like the two were the victims of a carjacking as they were driving through a township on the edge of Cape Town. Tongo was subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in the killing.
Proper protection
In their ruling, the judges at the High Court in London said there was some prospect that Dewani could recover sufficiently to be fit to stand trial.
It is also possible that the continued uncertainty over his extradition could act to deter his recovery.
They also said they were confident in the ability of South Africa's authorities to treat Dewani fairly.
"The death of the appellant's wife Anni occurred over three years ago," they said in their conclusions.
"The interests of justice, including the interests of her family who like other families of murdered persons wish to see a trial take place as soon as is practicable, require expedition and that there should be no further delay, provided that proper protection is afforded to the appellant in the manner we have set out."
CNN's Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.

Review: No exit from 'Welcome to Woop Woop'
Web posted on: Monday, December 07, 1998 4:05:56 PM EST
From Reviewer Paul Tatara
(CNN) -- I'll listen to any guesses as to what director Stephan Elliot is trying to accomplish with his new movie, "Welcome to Woop Woop." This is a bizarre piece of Outback whimsy that peppers its purposefully garish foolishness with playful shotgun blasts, murder, and systematic kangaroo slaughter.
On the surface, it's just another entry in the "town full of crazies" genre, something on the order of Oliver Stone's recent "U-Turn" or the unspeakable Dan Aykroyd monstrosity "Nothing But Trouble." But "Welcome to Woop Woop"'s vaguely post-apocalyptic Australian point of view also suggests the tedious, non-car chase moments in "The Road Warrior." The results are every bit as awful as the unfortunate title.
Theatrical preview for "Welcome to Woop Woop"
Windows Media:
28k or 56k
You know how a "town full of crazies" movie works. A regular guy (Jonathan Schaech in this case, who's too unbelievably handsome to be considered fully "regular") finds himself trapped in a small community that operates by its own oddball set of rules and regulations. Everybody who lives there is completely nuts, but they somehow don't know it, and our hero can't get away because his car is broken down.
There's usually a powerful man (played by Rod Taylor in "Welcome to Woop Woop") who invents and enforces all the crazy-ass rules, and the regular guy eventually falls for a local woman. This causes a movie to happen.
What caused 'Woop Woop' to happen?
Not always, though. I can't imagine what caused "Welcome to Woop Woop" to happen, outside of the fact that Elliot is also responsible for the surprise 1995 indie hit, "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert." That one is relatively pointless, too, but at least it features a couple of fun performances and there are tons of outlandish costumes to gape at.
Everybody in "Welcome to Woop Woop" (I'm getting really sick of typing that title), on the other hand, is badly sunburned and wears clothes that look like they were picked up at a Salvation Army explosion. I also noted about 10 different times during the movie when dialogue was being delivered by an actor with a fly crawling on his face. It happens most often to Schaech, which, it seems to me, is no way to treat perfectly good scenery.
As the movie opens, Schaech is a scam artist who's secured a truckload of illegally imported Australian cockatoos. We see him in a Manhattan alleyway, trying to sell one of the birds to Tina Louise. (Go ahead and read those two sentences again, if you like. Let me stress that I was completely sober while I watched this.)
Suddenly, a couple of bad guys show up and start harassing everyone, but a young woman dressed in a cowgirl outfit and a bushy fake-fur coat climbs out of the truck and shoots the troublemakers with a pistol. (Feel free to re-read that one, too.)
The contraband birds all fly away, and Schaech -- who knew the guys the cowgirl shot, and is terrified of them -- takes it on the lam. So he runs all the way to Australia. There, we see him driving across the Outback with a sex-crazed hitchhiker named Angie (Susie Porter) that he's picked up. After the two explore each other at a variety of buck-naked angles, Schaech is knocked unconscious, only to wake up lying in a pigsty in ... Woop Woop. (I'm strongly considering stopping right now so that I can avoid using that phrase again.)
A new type of shotgun wedding
Angie, it turns out, drugged Schaech, and the crazies performed a wedding ceremony while he was out of it. Schaech's been shanghaied because the immensely threatening head of the community, Daddy-O (Taylor), likes to occasionally bring some new blood into the place, to mate with the women.
Daddy-O, because he's movie-wacky, tap dances on the bar at the pub while wearing electric shoes that throw off streams of sparks with each step. He also, if anybody tries to make a break for it by climbing the embankment that surrounds the community, turns klieg lights on them and kills them with a deer rifle. Isn't that funny?
Other funny things about Woop Woop: The kids take potshots at stray dogs, just for the hell of it. Everyone spends their day grinding up kangaroos that are then packed into cans and sold as dog food. (The workers have no problem being completely caked in blood during this process.) There's also an outdoor movie theater where everyone watches an old print of "The Sound of Music," hollering out their favorite lines in unison. One woman farts a lot. There's burping. All that, and basic hygiene is frowned upon, too.
It's a brutal chore to sit through. The violence is too foul to be funny, and the "jokes" are mostly just stupid. Taylor isn't bad at all, but the character is so pointlessly repulsive, it's tough to even watch him. I was certainly rooting for Schaech when he finally took it into his head to escape from this appalling place. I just wish he had attempted to do it about an hour earlier. I made sure to take a hot shower when I got home.
"Welcome to Woop Woop" is proudly grotesque. There's nudity, both male and female, and a couple of straightforward sex scenes. Just like the rest of the movie, nothing much in those scenes is left to the imagination. Tina Louise's participation makes sense, since the story seems to be set in a bombed-out version of "Gilligan's Island." Rated R. 96 minutes. You tell me how these movies get made.
