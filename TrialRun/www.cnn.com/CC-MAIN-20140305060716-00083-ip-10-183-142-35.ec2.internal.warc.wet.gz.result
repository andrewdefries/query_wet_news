WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush maintains a thin lead over John Kerry in the battle for electoral votes in a race so tight that, despite a national focus on three larger swing states, could be decided by states with less pull in the Electoral College, like Iowa, Wisconsin or New Mexico, a new CNN analysis indicates.If the election were held today, Bush would win 277 electoral votes to Kerry's 261, according to a new CNN survey based on state polling, as well as interviews with campaign aides and independent analysts. The map is unchanged from last week. A candidate wins the election with 270 electoral votes, regardless of the popular vote.Each week, CNN's political unit prepares a comprehensive analysis of the most recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup polling and public polling, combined with a look at turnout trends, interviews with strategists from both campaigns and parties, independent pollsters, and the latest campaign and party spending on advertising in the states.Based on this analysis, CNN allocates states to each candidate to determine the breakdown of the Electoral College vote if the election were held today. The map is not a prediction of the Election Day outcome.The national race also remains virtually unchanged this week. Bush, who led Kerry by an average of 2 points in CNN's poll of national polls conducted last week, appears to lead by 3 points this week, well within the margin of errors of the polls that make up the average.Just over a week before November 2, the race remains so tight that if Kerry were to overtake Bush in a state with only 10 electoral votes -- Wisconsin, for example -- he would lead in the Electoral College.The electoral map, divided into "blue" Democratic states and "red" Republican states, offers a stark image of a nation divided. Bush is apparently ahead in 31 states, including the entire southern rim of the country except California, as well as a swath of states in the Rocky Mountains and Plains. Kerry appears ahead in the District of Columbia and the remaining 19 states, including all of New England, the upper Midwest and the West Coast.But the nation, while divided, is no more split than the states themselves. Bush and Kerry are polling too close to call in 11 states -- Florida, Ohio, Minnesota, Michigan, New Mexico, Iowa, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Wisconsin and Maine -- which together hold 125 electoral votes.For weeks, political analysts have said the candidate who carried two of the three biggest battleground states (Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania) would win the Electoral College. Although Kerry apparently leads in Ohio and Pennsylvania, he trails Bush in the overall electoral count because he is seemingly behind in Wisconsin, Iowa and New Mexico, key blue states that Al Gore won four years ago. Kerry leads Bush only in the traditionally red state of New Hampshire.Although Republicans concede that Bush's edge is slight at this point, aides say they see a number of scenarios that could lead to victory on Election Day."I'd much rather be President Bush than John Kerry," said Sara Taylor, a Bush campaign strategist, who strongly disputed CNN's decision to place Ohio in Kerry's column. "Kerry not only has to win every single competitive state Al Gore won, but he also has to pick off Ohio or Florida, both of which lean toward the president. There are a number of scenarios where you can arrive at a Bush victory. There's really only one scenario where John Kerry can win."Democrats disagree, saying their internal polls show them running ahead in Florida, Wisconsin and New Mexico, where CNN believes Bush is ahead."There are polls out there that have us even. There are polls that have us ahead, and there are polls that have us behind," said Mark Mellman, the Kerry campaign's chief pollster. "And the two things that all the polls agree on are that John Kerry is ahead in battleground states -- and that people who have yet to make a decision are very negative about the president and very negative about the current direction of the country." The campaigns plan to spend the final days of the race focusing on turning out voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, all of which are drawing high-profile surrogate speakers.Bush is to campaign in Florida on Saturday, while Gore and Sen. Hillary Clinton are scheduled to hold get-out-the-vote rallies and other campaign-style events there throughout the weekend.Former President Bill Clinton, who had heart surgery September 6, will be the headline speaker at a lunchtime rally Monday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with Kerry. The former president will campaign later next week in Florida and New Mexico.In Ohio, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is scheduled to make a rare campaign appearance for Bush next weekend. Aides say Bush will spend time in all 12 of the state's media markets between now and the election, and high-profile surrogates will be in the Buckeye State almost every day.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

How the Democrats survived until UnityStory Highlights Democrat presidential hopeful Barack Obama, rival Hillary Clinton hold first joint rally The show of unity -- in a town called Unity -- closes a chapter on Democrat race As Democrats put aside their divisions, so polls show a big lead over RepublicansNext Article in Politics » By Jonathan Mann	(CNN) -- There was no way you could miss the point -- they wouldn't let you. Last week Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama held their first joint campaign rally, in a town called Unity, in a field outside the Unity Elementary School. They went there together to pledge, yes, unity. It closed a chapter in the biggest story of the US presidential election campaign so far, as it heads into a couple of quiet months and the coming summer heat. In fact, there were three stories intertwined, namely the country's first real African-American contender for the presidency; its first real female contender; and the surprising disaster the combination of their campaigns could spell for the Democratic Party. The Democrats had everything going for them: an unpopular Republican incumbent in the White House, two wars they could blame him for not finishing and economic problems that play to their reputation as care-givers to the common man. But the excitement about making history with Obama or Clinton helped the party and hurt it too. Turnout for the Democratic Party primaries broke records in state after state, and dwarfed Republican numbers. Don't Miss Special: America votes
Special: The Campaign Trail
Special: 2008 Election Center
Then, as the campaign proceeded, the competition between Obama and Clinton grew more pointed and sometimes prickly. The most passionate Democrats turned against each other; some of Clinton's female voters angrily threatening to withhold their support from Obama, some of Obama's black voters threatening they wouldn't support Clinton. Clinton eventually withdrew after one of the longest, costliest and most divisive primary campaigns the Democrats had ever seen. Republican John McCain, by contrast, had an easy run through the primaries to become his party's nominee. His candidacy has its own problems but he is a well-known reformer who represents his party's best hope of breaking with the damaging legacy of the Bush administration. Public opinion polls even had McCain and Obama running neck-and-neck -- good news for the Republicans and potential trouble for the Democrats. But in Unity the Democrats put their divisions behind them and the polls suddenly showed a big bounce for Obama -- a double-digit lead over McCain. The first phase of the campaign has come to a close. The Democrats haven't done themselves in, after all. Stay tuned.

The Tamil Tigers' long fight explainedStory Highlights 25-year long insurgency has killed more than 70,000 people Tamil leader reportedly wore a cyanide capsule around his neck FBI says group pioneered use of suicide belts for bomb attacksNext Article in World » Read VIDEOMAP From Saeed Ahmed CNN COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Angered by what he perceived as the systemic discrimination of the minority Tamils by successive Sri Lankan governments, 18-year-old Velupillai Prabhakaran, armed with just a revolver, set out in 1972 to right the perceived wrongs by forming a militant group. Sri Lanka's defense ministry says this handout photo shows troops with a captured Tamil Tiger craft. That group eventually morphed into the Tamil Tigers, who have engaged in a brutal 25-year insurgency for an independent Tamil state that has left more than 70,000 dead. Along the way, the group has been declared a terrorist organization in 32 countries, pioneered the use of women in suicide attacks and, according to the FBI, invented the suicide belt. It was also behind the assassination of two world leaders -- the only terrorist organization to do so. Over the weekend, the militants offered to "silence" their guns after an intense military offensive decimated their ranks, usurping them from their stronghold in the north and east of the country, and cornered the remaining rebels on a small stretch of land. Watch more on the possible end to the conflict » On Monday afternoon, the Sri Lankan government said it had killed Prabhakaran. If the rebels now follow through on their announcement, the action will potentially mark the end of the longest-running civil war in Asia. Who are the Tamils? The Tamils are an ethnic group that makes up about 12 percent of Sri Lanka's population of about 20 million. They mostly dominate the northern and eastern part of the country. Tamils are mostly Hindu and speak Tamil. Don't Miss Sri Lanka: Tamil leader may be among dead Tamil Tigers offer to 'silence our guns' in Sri Lanka conflict

That sets them apart from Sri Lanka's majority group, the Sinhalese, who make up 74 percent of the population. They are Buddhists and speak Sinhala. The tension between the two ethnic groups date to the British colonization of the country -- an island in the Indian Ocean, south of India. At the time, the country was known as Ceylon. Many Sri Lankans regarded the Tamils as British collaborators and resented the preferential treatment they received. The tables turned when the country achieved independence in 1948 and the Sinhalese majority dominated government. It was the Tamils then who claimed they were being discriminated against in politics, employment and education. By the 1970s Tamil politicians were demanding a separate Tamil state. It would be called Tamil Eelam. In this climate Prabhakaran emerged with his militant group, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Who is Prabhakaran? Prabhakaran operated from a secret jungle base in the northeastern part of the country, granting few media interviews and remaining an elusive figure to even many Tigers. He was reputed to wear a cyanide capsule around his neck -- to swallow rather than risk capture. And he reportedly expected the same dedication from his troops. As a result, few Tigers have been captured alive. To Prabhakaran's supporters he was a hero fighting for the rights of his people. The Sri Lankan government deemed him a war criminal with disregard for civilian casualties. He was wanted by Interpol on charges including terrorism and organized crime. In 1975, three years after forming his group, Prabhakaran was accused of fatally shooting the mayor of Jaffna, his birthplace. Prabhakaran was also accused of masterminding the killing of then-Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in the Tamil-dominated Indian state of Tami Nadu. Sri Lankan authorities allege that Prabhakaran was avenging Gandhi's decision to send Indian peacekeepers to Sri Lanka. Two years later, a Tigers' suicide bomber, allegedly acting under Prabhakaran's orders, detonated explosives that killed Sri Lanka's then-president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, during a rally. Watch aid agencies fear for Sri Lanka » Who are the Tamil Tigers? The Tigers reportedly number about 10,000, recruited from villagers in Tamil-dominated areas and unemployed Tamil youths who think they were passed over for jobs because of their ethnicity. Their armed struggle began in July 1983 when the Tigers killed 13 Sinhalese soldiers. It led to, what was until then, the largest outburst of violence in the island's history. Hundreds of Tamils were killed, thousands left homeless and more than 100,000 fled to south India. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Tigers have -- until now -- shown no signs of being overpowered by the Sri Lankan military. The Tigers are infamous for suicide bombings, with men and women strapping on suicide vests for more than 200 attacks against Sri Lankan citizens and dozens of high-profile political leaders. In addition to perpetrating the attacks that killed Gandhi and Premadasa, the rebels have carried out the assassinations of two lawmakers and four ministers. A suicide bomber targeted Sri Lankan then-President Chandrika Kumaratunga in December 1999 while she was campaigning for re-election. She was wounded but survived. The Tigers, however, have refrained from targeting Western tourists out of fear that foreign governments would crack down on Tamil expatriates who raise money for them abroad, the U.S. State Department said. Have there been peace talks? Periodically fighting has briefly halted because of a handful of peace agreements. By February 2002 the Tigers had dropped their demands for a separate homeland in exchange for a power-sharing deal with the government. Norway and some other countries agreed to monitor the ceasefire. A year later the rebels dropped out of the negotiations, saying they were being marginalized. They launched a suicide bombing campaign soon after. What led to renewed fighting? In January 2008 the Sri Lankan government announced it was annulling the nearly six-year-old truce with the rebels, declaring that it would crush the rebels. The fighting intensified with security forces driving the rebels from their strongholds in the east and north of the country. The government asked the rebels to lay down arms; the rebels vowed to continue. Caught in the crossfire were civilians, thousands of whom were displaced and hundreds killed. International aid groups expressed concern that both the government and the rebels disregarded civilian safety even in no-fire zones and hospitals. Both sides blamed the other for civilian casualties and exaggerated accounts of their victories. With journalists not allowed into the battle zones, their claims could not be independently confirmed. On Sunday, the Tigers posted an "urgent statement" on a pro-rebel Web site, saying the battle had reached "its bitter end." "We have decided to silence our guns," the statement said. Euphoria gripped the war-wracked nation. And Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa readied to announce to Tuesday that military operations had ended. But one last order of business awaited: The capture, dead or alive, of Prabhakaran. In the past, the Tigers have emerged from near-defeat. But if Prabhakaran's death is confirmed, the government is optimistic that it can write off the Tigers. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

Vehicle flips, 7 die near Bronx Zoo
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 7:45 AM EDT, Mon April 30, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The dead include three children, ages 10, 7 and 3, police say
A 45-year-old woman was driving
All the victims were wearing seat belts
The vehicle landed in part of the Bronx Zoo, a zoo official says
New York (CNN) -- Seven people, including three children, died Sunday when a vehicle flipped over a guardrail and plunged nearly 60 feet to the ground, landing upside down in an area of the Bronx Zoo that is closed to the public, officials said.
The crash occurred near the Bronx River Parkway and East 180th Street.
"Police determined that a 2004 Honda Pilot traveling southbound on the Bronx River Parkway in the left lane had struck the center median, crossed over three southbound lanes and struck the curb, causing the vehicle to become airborne and continue over the guardrail and fall approximately 59 feet down into a wooded area inside of Bronx Zoo property," the New York Police Department said in a statement.
Police identified the victims as driver Maria Gonzalez, 45; Jocelyn Gonzalez, 10; Maria Nunez, 39; Niely Rosario, 7; Marly Rosario, 3; Jacob Nunez, 85; and Ana Julia Martinez, 81.
Crash near Bronx Zoo kills 7
All were pronounced dead at the scene and an investigation is ongoing, police said.
NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said all the victims were wearing seat belts. He had previously given the older girls' ages as 15 and 5.
Browne said the driver likely overcompensated when the left side of the SUV struck the barrier.
The vehicle was traveling at a high speed, said FDNY Deputy Chief Ronald Werner.
Zoo spokeswoman Mary Dixon said the vehicle landed just inside the southeast perimeter of the 265-acre zoo. A baby bag with diapers inside was found at the scene.
"It's far from any public area," Dixon said. "No animals, exhibits or visitors were affected. ... It would be impossible for any visitors to see this."
The area where the vehicle fell is adjacent to where the zoo's trams are parked, Werner said.
The fire department's Howard Sickles told reporters that in his 20 years he's "seen a lot of horrific things and this is one of them."
The crushed vehicle came to rest in overgrown brush, Werner said. Authorities used thermal imaging cameras to find victims in case any had been ejected, he said.
Authorities received multiple calls about the incident at about 12:30 p.m., Werner said.
In 2006, six people died in an accident on the Bronx River Parkway near the site of Sunday's crash.
CNN's Miguel Susana, Steve Kastenbaum, Ross Levitt and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The USS Porter, a guided missile destroyer, collides with a tanker
The Japanese-owned tanker was operating under a Panamanian flag
No one is injured in the collision, the Navy says
The Porter "is able to operate under its own power," the Navy says (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy said its guided missile destroyer collided with a Japanese-owned oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz early Sunday morning.
No one was injured in the collision that occurred about 1 a.m. local time when the USS Porter collided with the Panamanian-flagged bulk oil tanker M/V Otowasan, the Navy said in a statement.
The Navy did not provide details about the collision, saying only the accident was not related to combat. It said the incident is under investigation.
Damage to the USS Porter was being evaluated, "but the ship is able to operate under its own power," the statement said.
The Navy did not say what, if any, damage the Otowasan incurred in the collision.
The USS Porter, in the Persian Gulf on a scheduled deployment, is assigned to the U.S. 5th Fleet. It is conducting maritime security operations, the Navy said.

Amnesty details 'horrific abuses' in southern Yemen
By Mohammed Jamjoom, CNN
updated 5:43 AM EST, Tue December 4, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
New Amnesty International report came out Tuesday
Ansar al-Sharia took control of the area
"They committed horrific abuses," Amnesty says
(CNN) -- Residents in parts of southern Yemen experienced a "human rights catastrophe" when an al-Qaeda affiliate took control of the country's Abyan province for 14 months, according to Amnesty International.
In a new report entitled "Conflict in Yemen: Abyan's Darkest Hour", the rights group catalogs "a raft of gross and deeply disturbing" punishments carried out by Ansar al-Sharia, including crucifixions, public executions, amputations and floggings.

"They committed horrific abuses," said Cilina Nasser, of Amnesty International. "They set up courts, their own courts and claimed to apply Islamic law."
One man, accused of spying for the U.S., was killed and then had his remains crucified. A video obtained by the rights group shows the rotting body, which had been left out in the open for days -- a warning to anyone who might consider doing the same.

How was U.S. embassy breached?
In another video, a prisoner, bound and blindfolded, is led to a public square. The man, convicted of spying on al-Qaeda for Saudi Arabia, is then readied for execution.

For the U.S. and Yemen, who for years have been attempting to vanquish a resurgent and emboldened al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the news couldn't have been more dire.
"As the United States and as Saudi Arabia have been very, very concerned about al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula being able to sort of plot, plan and launch attacks from their hideouts in Yemen, the Saudis and Americans have worked together to create these undercover agents," Gregory Johnsen, a Yemen expert who has written a book on the nation.
But the militants were not only going after alleged spies.

According to Amnesty International, one woman was beheaded for the crime of sorcery. In an extremely disturbing video, her severed head can be seen as it is paraded through the streets.
And one young man, accused of theft, had his hand publicly amputated.
"They detained me in a room for five days," the young man later told the rights group. "They kept beating me hard ... After five days, they gave me an injection and I slept ...When I woke up my hand was not there."
A chilling video shows him lying unconscious -- his left arm stretched out as one man begins cutting through the wrist. Once done, a spectator takes the severed hand and raises it for the gathered crowd to see. Cries of "God is great" can then be heard.
"In 2011, the Yemeni military essentially split during the uprising that eventually overthrew the long serving president Ali Abdullah Saleh," explained Yemen expert Gregory Johnsen. "They were fighting amongst themselves and what this did is it opened up a lot of space for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and their affiliate Ansar Al-Shaira to take over villages and towns in Southern Yemen, particularly in Abyan and in Shabwa."
Between February 2011 and June 2012, after seizing those areas, they began imposing and practicing a very draconian interpretation of Islamic law.

But in that time, they were also able to provide services a weak central government had not.
"They established their own police system, their own court system," Johnsen said. "They started to dig water wells, string electrical lines in villages that had never had these before, that had essentially been ignored by the Yemeni government for decades."
"On one hand," added Johnsen, "they were welcomed in the fact that they were able to impose law and security. But the longer they stayed, the more unpopular they became."
According to Amnesty International, in the end, the people of Abyan weren't just subjected to repression by Ansar al-Sharia, they were also subjected to additional violations by the Yemeni government forces.
"When the situation evolved into an armed conflict between Ansar al-Sharia and the Yemeni government," explained Nasser, "both sides committed violations of international humanitarian law."
Amnesty's report states how Ansar al-Sharia used residential areas as its base, "recklessly exposing civilian residents to harm."
The righs group also details how it says the Yemeni military's intense aerial bombardment as well as the use of inappropriate battlefield weapons in residential areas further endangered a population already in peril.
"Scores of civilians, including children, were killed," reads the report, "and many more injured as a result of air strikes and artillery and mortar attacks by government forces."
The "toxic mix of fighting and human rights abuses," it states, "meant an estimated 250,000 people from the southern governorates, particularly Abyan, were displaced."
The Yemeni government said it is studying the Amnesty report.
"The Yemeni government will carefully examine the findings," said Mohammed Albasha, the spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington. "Sanaa continues to welcome the international community's support of the government's efforts to promote and protect human rights."
Albasha added that Yemen's President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi had this past September "established a committee to investigate human rights violations" and that the country had "officially adopted the Paris Principles, which provide guidelines on the protection of children during armed conflict."
While Ansar al-Sharia was ultimately driven out and Yemen's government ended up claiming success, continued instability in the country, a haven for Al-Qaeda, has left many wondering how long will that victory may last.

Howser grew up in Tennessee, graduated from the University of Tennessee, worked on a U.S. senator's staff and served in the U.S. Marine Corps, according to a biography posted on his company website. He then launched his television career at WSM in Nashville.
He moved on to a job hosting a magazine-style TV series at WCBS in New York before landing in Los Angeles in 1981 as a reporter for KCBS.
Six years later, Howser joined forces with KCET, a public television station, to produce a program known as "Videolog" showcasing the stories of all types of people.
That led to "California's Gold" and six other series about life in the Golden State, including "Visiting with Huell Howser," "Road Trip with Huell Howser," "California's Golden Parks," "California's Green," "California's Water" and "Downtown." In addition to California, his shows could be seen in Oregon, Nevada and Tennessee.
Less than 20 minutes after KCET posted news of Howser's death on its Facebook page, more than 150 fans had posted responses mourning his loss and remembering his impact on California and their lives.
They remembered him as "amazing," a "favorite" and "one-of-a-kind talent" who also possessed a "kind curiosity."
One man said that news of Howser's death "brought tears to my eyes like I lost a friend," and another remarked that "Sunday evenings will not be the same."
"So I guess God needed a host for 'Heaven's Gold,'" wrote another Facebook commenter. "We will miss you, but you will live on ... and on."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"It was not a terrorist attack," mayor says
30 people taken to hospitals, including one man with serious injuries, official says
Blast collapses first floor's ceiling; fire department searching for gas leaks
Buildings evacuated, including those used by a film and TV school and by Charles University
(CNN) -- A gas explosion ripped through a building containing offices and an art gallery in a historic district of central Prague on Monday morning, injuring 35 people and prompting evacuations of nearby buildings in the Czech capital, officials said.
More than 230 people were evacuated from the area, including from buildings used by schools including Charles University and the Academy of Performing Arts' film and TV school, known as FAMU, officials said.
"We can now confirm this was a gas explosion. It was not a terrorist attack," Prague Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda told reporters Monday.
The blast at 5 Divadelni Street, not far from the National Theatre and a block from the Vltava River, which cuts through the city, collapsed the first floor's ceiling, officials said. Windows in neighboring buildings were damaged.
Officials do not believe anyone is trapped in the rubble, though fire officials will remain at the site for a while longer "to be 100% sure nobody is in there," Svoboda said. People who initially were unaccounted for were later found with minor injuries, he said
Of the 35 people injured, 30 were taken to hospitals, including two people who suffered serious injuries, officials with the city's emergency services said.
The city's fire department, which is examining the area for possible gas leaks, said it would take two days to stabilize the site. Charles University canceled classes at an adjacent building for the rest of Monday.
A surveyor employed by the city told reporters Monday that the building might not need to be demolished and that the damage appears to be reparable.
Powerful gas explosion rocks Prague
Earlier, Czech news media gave conflicting reports of the building's location, with an outlet reporting at one point that the blast happened at a FAMU building.
FAMU dean Pavel Jech said that the blast happened near FAMU's main building, known as Lazansky Palace, which was evacuated.
"Nobody in FAMU has suffered any injuries," Jech said. "There will be no classes for the rest of the week at Lazansky Palace. Classes scheduled at other locations ... will continue as planned.
Marianna Zapotilova was in an office in a nearby building when the blast happened. The office's window was open, and the force of the blast "pushed me away from my computer," she said.
"There was a lot of dust" immediately after the explosion, Zapotilova said. "People in the area were injured, mainly by broken glass from the windows; they had their heads bandaged."
CNN's Sarah Balter contributed to this report.
