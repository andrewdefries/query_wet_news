Commentary: What Alaska learned about PalinStory Highlights Year of Alaska's 50th anniversary as a state brought new attention Campaign put spotlight on Alaska and its governor, Sarah Palin Kaylene Johnson: Palin played new role of hard-line partisan Palin has some fence-mending to do at home as she returns, Johnson says Next Article in Politics » By Kaylene Johnson Special to CNN	Editor's note: Kaylene Johnson is the author of the Sarah Palin biography "Sarah: How a Hockey Mom Turned Alaska's Politics Upside Down." She has written for the Los Angeles Times, Alaska magazine and other publications. Kaylene Johnson says Sarah Palin's role on the national scene didn't match her role in Alaska. WASILLA, Alaska (CNN) -- In a year when Alaska celebrates 50 years of statehood, it can be argued that our state finally joined the union August 29, 2008, when Gov. Sarah Palin was nominated by Sen. John McCain as his vice presidential running mate. Suddenly, everything Alaskan and everything Sarah came under micro-scrutiny as media from all over the world descended on small-town Alaska to find out more about the woman who held the possibility of becoming the most powerful leader in the world. In the harsh light of that scrutiny, we learned a few things about our governor. And we learned a few things about ourselves. What surprised many Alaskans was the warrior persona that grew up around Palin as she took on the role of partisan pit bull. Although she campaigned against rabid partisanship in her bid for the governor's office, we learned that when the job calls for it, she is capable and willing to become a hard-liner for her party. Her legacy as governor, however, has been based more on cooperation than confrontation. Many of her staunchest supporters here were Democrats who appreciated her willingness to reach across the aisle to get the job done. With team spirit and a singular vision, Palin achieved more progress in two years toward the development of a natural gas pipeline than the previous two administrations put together. She ushered in reform at a time when Alaskan legislators were being convicted of corruption, and she welcomed an investigation that would clear her of wrongdoing in what became known as Troopergate. Don't Miss Commentary: McCain aides shouldn't attack Palin
Analysis: Palin rocked campaign, for good and bad
Commentary: Embracing your inner diva
In Depth: Commentaries
Once Palin became McCain's VP pick, the investigation became politically charged, and many of the alliances Palin had created across party lines became strained. From the McCain/Palin perspective, the investigation had become a political witch hunt. Conversely, Democrats accused the McCain/Palin camp of stonewalling. And so it went, with Palin burning some hard-won political capital right up to the day before the election, when the state's personnel board exonerated her. Her popularity before being launched on the national stage was more than 80 percent; today, her popularity in the state ranges between 64 and 68 percent, figures enviable to most politicians in America. Even so, she will have some political fences to mend on the home front. People close to Palin told me early in the campaign that the McCain camp's "handling" of Sarah Palin was unfortunate not only to Palin but to the campaign. Putting a muzzle and straitjacket on her and then scripting her so tightly that she came across as foolish was a "colossal blunder," according to one of Palin's closest aides. Her national poll numbers grew increasingly negative. Even so, Palin drew enormous, enthusiastic crowds throughout the country and energized McCain's flagging candidacy, not a bad debut for a newcomer to the national political stage. Home-grown supporters were willing to take to the streets in Alaska and across the nation to seek a victory. One group of supporters organized, calling themselves Alaskans for Reform. One of the organizers, Mary Havens, told me that after their offers to volunteer were rebuffed by the McCain camp, they set up their own shop, conducted rallies and raised $24,000 for the campaign. Many of these hard-core enthusiasts were the same people who succeeded in their grass-roots, statewide effort to put Palin in office in the first place. Through groups like Alaskans for Reform, we learned that Alaskans don't need anyone's permission to stand up for what they believe. iReport.com: What next for Palin? The people who know Sarah Palin best say that she joined the McCain campaign with a sincere desire to do what was best for America. She hoped that she would succeed in helping John McCain ascend to the presidency. Instead, she stood by McCain as he made a concession speech congratulating Sen. Barack Obama on winning the White House. The next day, in Palin's more characteristic style, she called on Americans to unite in supporting the new administration as the nation faces the challenges that lie ahead. As for 2012, if Palin chooses to run for the presidency, she will now know just how intensely personal and ugly a campaign can get. She will have the traction of being a household name. She will have more experience. And perhaps most important, she'll be running for office on her own terms. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kaylene Johnson.

U.S. couple from Georgia experiences Hajj pilgrimageBy Amir Ahmed, CNN From Mecca to MinaSTORY HIGHLIGHTSU.S. couple arrives in Saudi Arabia to celebrate Hajj pilgrimageHina Babar, who lives in Georgia, was raised in the Saudi capital RiyadhBabar, a new mom, and her husband spent a year planning for trip

Mina, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- Hina Babar had prepared for this day for months. But now, as she landed in Saudi Arabia for the Muslim pilgrimage Hajj, the time seemed to have flown by. "I never thought this day would come so quickly," Babar said, as she and her husband, Khuram, arrived from Marietta, Georgia. For the new mom, preparations for the trip began more than a year ago, when she was seven months pregnant. "I was just beginning to feel what a mother's love is like for her child, yet I had no understanding of how difficult it was going to be to leave my baby behind," Babar said. The couple left their now-10-month-old boy with Hina Babar's parents before embarking on their sacred journey. The Hajj, an obligatory pilgrimage for able-bodied Muslims, began this year on Wednesday. Despite a rare rainstorm that inundated the city of Mina, 2.5 million pilgrims performed the ancient rituals without incident. For Babar, a final phone call to her parents before she boarded her flight to Saudi Arabia last week brought news that baby Kamran's first tooth had come in. "Now I am bawling," she said. "This is my baby's first tooth, and I missed it." Twenty hours later, the couple arrived from New York in Medina, Islam's second-holiest city after Mecca. The couple prayed at al-Masjid al-Nabawi, where Muslims believe their prophet, Mohammed, is buried. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from more than 50 countries prayed alongside them. Babar found herself sharing her prayer rug with an elderly woman whom she didn't know. "At the mosque, you just don't look at who is next to you. Everyone shares, sometimes voluntarily and sometimes involuntarily," she said. Beyond the pilgrimage, the trip to Saudi Arabia carries special significance for Babar: She lived in the capital, Riyadh, as a child, and she wanted to share some of those childhood landmarks with her husband. "There are so many things that I talk about that are absolutely foreign to him, ... even eating a chicken shawarma, the best sandwich in the entire world," she added. So, during their stay in Mina, Babar took her husband on a quest for some good shawarma. He agreed: Saudis do make the best. "Driving through the streets, smelling all the scents, I smell some familiar scents that I can make out and some that are absolutely new to me," Babar said. Now the couple is readying for Friday, when they travel to Mecca to circle the Kaaba, the most sacred site in Islam. It will be the next chapter on what has already been a trip that's yielded a lifetime of memories.

Talk of war and rising prices cast uneasy pall over Iran
By Mitra Mobasherat and Moni Basu, CNN
updated 9:14 AM EDT, Sun March 18, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Tehran college student Sepideh refuses to watch the news
She worries about war coming to her homeland
Anxieties are heightened by dismal economic prospects
Upcoming Persian new year celebrations are sure to be more muted (CNN) -- At Sepideh's home in the Iranian capital, the television is more often switched to "America's Next Top Model" and "American Idol" than the news.
Not that the 22-year-old college student wants anyone to think her superficial, but it's her way of coping with the ominous -- the heated rhetoric of war with Israel and the United States.
"My friends and I don't talk about politics or the thought of a war," she says, laughing. "I stopped watching the news all together. It's too depressing."
Sepideh is not unlike millions of Iranians who, like their neighboring Iraqis did in early 2003, fear war is looming.
Israel would face challenge in bombing Iran nuclear sites, experts say
Israel, Gaza exchange rocket fire
Can Iran be trusted on nuclear program?
Some are less worried than others -- a Tehran fast food worker says Israel has been threatening Iran for years and this time is more of the same bluster.
Still, all the bellicose talk from national leaders and punishing international sanctions trickling down to average Iranians who are paying higher prices for food and basic commodities, has cast an uneasy pall over life's routine.
Israel has threatened to bomb Iran to end or at least set back Iran's nuclear ambitions. Iran insists its nuclear program is strictly for energy purposes and has said it will not hesitate to strike back at its enemies.
U.S. President Barack Obama has stated Iran developing nuclear weapons is not acceptable and that Washington "will always have Israel's back."
That sort of talk is unsettling to Sepideh, who like others in this story did not want their full names used for fear of repercussion.
She tries to go about life focusing on her education and hanging out with friends in tony Tehran coffee shops. She buys Hollywood at the local bazaar and swoons over Johnny Depp. In many ways she is not unlike her American counterparts except that Sepideh lives in the Islamic Republic and her government is considered an enemy of Washington.
Possible targets of an Israeli air strike in Iran.

She thinks longingly about moving to America one day. In her country, she feels, she will never be able to freely express herself or her passion for art, music, films. She cannot fathom why the United States would consider an attack Iran.
Opinion: Israel's 'Iron Dome' system isn't enough protection
"I understand why America doesn't like our government. They don't agree that they should impose Islam on our society but that should not give them a reason for war," she says.
Her parents worry that the bombing of Iran would create another situation like Iraq in 2003. They are especially concerned because Sepideh's brother is 17 and because of Iran's mandatory conscription, he will have to serve in the military after high school.
"If there were a war, no doubt my brother would be in danger," she says.
The family has applied for visas through Sepideh's aunt in California. Sepideh prays every night that they will be granted.
"I have faith in (Barack) Obama's policies," she says. "I think he is a smart man who in the end will make the right decision to not start a war with Iran."
Nevertheless, a sense of panic is on the rise in cities and towns across Iran over the prospect of guns and no butter.
Tighter sanctions drove down the Iranian currency, the rial, and Iranians gobbled up gold, American dollars and even real estate in order to protect their savings.
Food prices have soared, too, prompting some to stockpile basic items in case an even darker day looms over the horizon.
This week the strangling of Iran's finances got tighter. SWIFT, the world's largest electronic banking system, agreed to cut off Iranian banks and individuals on the European Union's sanctions list.
Starting at noon Saturday, Iran will be severed from the main vehicle for monetary transactions. Iran's business partners, including vital crude oil customers who account for half of the government's revenues, will have to find an alternative way to pay.
Beyond staggering inflation and a plunging national currency, analysts fear Iranians now could face shortages of essential goods like food and medicine.
Retired elementary school teacher Shikoufeh, 67, lives in the city of Isfahan, just south of Natanz, an uranium enrichment facility for power plants or potentially for bombs.
In her modest two-bedroom apartment, she cares for her two grandchildren because her daughter was forced to go back to work to make ends meet. She takes the children for walks in a nearby park and wonders what would happen if Israel conducted military strikes against Iran's nuclear plants and military installations.
"Iranians are educated, fun-loving people," she says. "We are against war and against aggression."
She wishes Americans knew more about the rich history of her country -- art, music, poetry -- and about the turmoil Iranians have survived.
"I honestly think they look at us as terrorists, like the ones that are portrayed in the movies,' she says. "They think we wear burkas like they do in Afghanistan, and don't allow women to drive like in Saudi Arabia. Iran is different, we are different. We want peace like anyone else in this world."
Shikoufeh's anxiety is heightened on Sundays when she heads to the fruit and vegetable market. Last week, the price of tomatoes went up so much that she could not justify buying them. The butcher told her he hadn't seen profit in two months -- who can afford to buy meat anymore?
She tried to buy U.S. dollars recently but the bank informed her of limits on how much she could exchange.
"I always like to save some dollars in my house, just in case," she says.
Nowruz, the Persian new year, is coming up March 20, but Shikoufeh says this year, the traditional meals and large get togethers will be a lot simpler.
"I'm worried that our beautiful country will become similar to what the Americans did to Iraq," she says. "I pray to God they don't. I love America and love Americans. They are lovely people. But I don't understand the need to meddle in our country's issues."
She says she is willing to live with Iran's problems, if only she could have a guarantee of no war.
"That would be the end to our livelihoods and the little freedom we have now," she says.
Back in Tehran, Amir, 39, says he is more concerned about facing economic hardship than dodging missiles and rockets.
"It's all bluffing and political nonsense," says the university English instructor about threats from Israel and the West.
"This happens every few years between Iran, Israel and the U.S. This is normal," he says. "In a month it will quiet down again and in two years it will flare up again. This is the political wheel, always spinning. Obama has said he doesn't want a war with Iran, and we all know Israel cannot proceed with a war alone."
Amir sees money as his number one problem. He resents having to rely on his parents for support but he, his wife and child are forced to stay in an extra apartment at his parents' home. Even though he has a degree and good job, his salary is no match for the prices at the market.
"My advice to my country is to open our doors to the world," he says. "Let's show them that we have a right to nuclear technology, and that we are not making nuclear weapons. The Western nations always want to have their hands in other countries. I'm pretty sure unemployment and crime is high in America. Shouldn't they be focusing on that?"
The tension within Iran is affecting people outside its borders, too.
Tina, 36, and Shermineh, 34, fled Iran with their mother after the 1979 revolution and have not been back since. They have not seen their grandparents since they were babies.
Tina says her grandmother weeps on the phone every week when they speak over the continents and oceans. To see her granddaughters again would help her die a "blessed old woman."
The sisters, who live in Los Angeles, planned to return to their homeland for the very first time for the Persian new year. They booked their tickets and arranged their trip to Tabriz, the city where her family used to live.
"I was most excited about seeing all the places my mom talks about," Tina says. That included the house where her mother was born.
But a few weeks ago, once news broke of Israel possibly planning a spring strike, Tina's mother canceled the trip for her daughters.
"I understand its for our safety, but I am really disappointed," Tina says. "I hope one day this political mess will clear up and we can go. I'm not giving up, but when I turn on the news, it doesn't seem like things are getting better."
For now all that Tina and her sister will have to wait to see what the future bodes. As will all of Iran.

Six tech resolutions for 2013
By Heather Kelly, CNN
updated 7:06 PM EST, Wed January 2, 2013 | Filed under: Web
The dawn of a new year is a good time to make technology resolutions.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Keep your data safe this year with backups and two-factor authentication
For a fun New Year's project check out the many free online courses and start learning
Take a moment to read the terms of service for your e-mail, photo sites and social networks
Cut down on checking your phone and engage with the world around you
(CNN) -- Between your new regimen of daily workouts, volunteering, painting or whatever else you've resolved to do more of in the New Year, make time for a few tech-centric resolutions.
They're low impact and will keep your memories and online identity safer, your mind sharper and your friendships healthier.
Here are six you can do right now. You'll thank yourself later.
Back up your stuff
Back up your files. Do it now, do it often, do not put it off until your hard drive suddenly and unexpectedly perishes or until your laptop is stolen from a cafe when you run to the bathroom.
Top colleges offer free online classes
Everyone will have different backup needs, but for the most basic computer backups there are a few basic options. You can use an external hard drive or a cloud service. There are services like Carbonite, which will automatically back up photos, music, documents and emails for an annual fee. If you have an Apple computer, turn on Time Machine and it will backup your files to the drive of your choice in the background.
You also can use a cloud storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive to save a copy of select files. A nice Dropbox feature is that it can automatically save new photos from connected cameras or smartphones to the cloud.
Turn on 2-factor authentication
Hopefully by now you know and follow all the best practices for protecting your passwords: Avoid dictionary words; use multiword pass phrases; don't use the same password across multiple sites; keep it memorable but not obvious. But strong passwords aren't enough to keep you completely secure. When it comes to your important online accounts, one of the most effective security measures you can take is turning on two-factor authentication.
Two-factor authentication requires you to confirm your identity with two separate things. Typically it's something you know, like a password, and something you have, like your cell phone or a key fob. For example, when you try to log in to a Gmail account from an unrecognized location, Google will text you a code you need to enter.
Start with your e-mail accounts, which can be used to gain access to your other online accounts. Gmail and Yahoo both offer two-factor authentication, but Outlook currently does not. Cloud storage services with two-factor include Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft's Sky Drive. Apple's iCloud does not yet offer it. Facebook has its own two-factor feature called login approvals.
Two-factor can be a hassle to use and will take some getting used to, but it's a small inconvenience to avoid the much larger, more devastating inconvenience of being hacked.
Scan old photos
We all have them. The stacks of old photos hidden in boxes under the bed or collecting dust in basements. If you don't have digital copies of these gems, stop stalling and start scanning. Natural disasters, floods and fires can wipe out film memories in an instant. To scan your images, get a flatbed scanner and place multiple images on the bed at a time. You can crop and retouch individual pictures later.
If manually scanning in each old photo sounds like too big (or boring) of an undertaking, you can hire a company to do it for you. Many local camera stores offer bulk-scanning services and will return your originals along with high-resolution TIFFs or JPEGs on a CD or hard drive. And you can store copies of your photos online in case your laptop crashes (see resolution No. 1).
If you're comfortable sending your photos away, the best option is using a company that specialize in bulk photo scanning. They'll even do light retouching and repairs for older pictures, videos and slides. Check out ScanDigital.com or ScanCafe.com.
Step away from the smartphone
If you spend most of the day with your nose buried a smartphone, tablet or computer, make an effort to break out of the digital world and interact more with the humans around you in 2013. Don't habitually check your online social networks while hanging out with your flesh-and-blood friends. On a date? Don't even think about texting. (Unless the date is going horribly and they're in the bathroom and you need to arrange an emergency extraction.)
Attempt to live in the moment instead of just documenting the moment on Instagram. Yes, that sunset will look stunning with the Valencia filter, but it will look even better through your own eyeballs.
There's a time and a place for texting and e-mailing and checking Twitter. But this year, let's try to leave the screens in our pockets and bags more often and engage with the world around us.
Read the TOS and check privacy settings
Terms of service are long, boring documents filled with impenetrable legalese. But before you upload content or share personal information with a site, take a few minutes to read over its terms of service -- and any privacy agreements -- so you have a better idea of who owns your data and what the company can do with it. Start with the biggies you're probably already using such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, Yahoo and Twitter.
Next, take a trip to your privacy settings. Even if you had your settings just the way you wanted them a year ago, the company could have updated the controls and left some of your information exposed.
Learn something new online Tech resolutions aren't all preventative measures to avoid doom and gloom. You can also embark on fun, self-improvement projects. Quality classes are free and plentiful online. There are courses for every age, interest and attention span, from major universities and organizations.
Pick up a language, learn how to code at Codecademy or just be inspired by the best Ted Talks. Apple's iTunes U is stocked with videos and podcasts of classes, as well as supporting materials like worksheets and ebooks. You can access them from a computer or download the ITunes U iPad or iPhone app. The YouTube Education channel has instructional videos on math, business, language and the other usual suspects, including fun experiments you can try at home. Check out the Spangler Science channel and prepare to simultaneously mess with and impress your kids.
Coursera offers free college courses from big name universities including Princeton, Emory, Stanford, Johns Hopkins and Columbia. Get the knowledge without the student loans (or course credit, unfortunately).

NFL player accused of having gun at N.Y. airport
By Erinn Cawthon and Kristina Sgueglia, CNN updated 11:11 PM EST, Mon February 18, 2013
Tampa Bay Buccaneers Da'Quan Bowers, left, and Gerald McCoy celebrate after a sack during a game last season.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive end Da'Quan Bowers had gun at airport, authorities allege He was arrested at a LaGuardia Airport ticket counter, the port authority says
He was charged with second-degree criminal possession, the district attorney's office says
(CNN) -- A defensive end for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was arraigned late Monday night after being accused of having a semiautomatic weapon in his suitcase at New York's LaGuardia Airport, according to the Queens District Attorney's Office.
Da'Quan Bowers, 22, was charged with second-degree criminal possession by Judge Toko Serita in New York Criminal Court late Monday night, according to Meris Campbell of the Queens District Attorney's Office.
Bail was set at $10,000, Campbell said. Video recorded outside the courthouse Monday night showed Bowers getting into a car and driving away after the arraignment.
Bowers was arrested at an airport ticket counter with a .40-caliber handgun, according to Rudy King, a spokesperson for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport.
Campbell said there were no bullets in the gun, but there were bullets near the gun in a separate location. According to New York firearms law, if bullets are found next to the weapon, it is considered loaded, Campbell said.
Bowers was headed to North Carolina and was flying on US Airways, Campbell said.
In a statement CNN obtained from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Monday, General Manager Mark Dominik said: "We are aware of the situation and are gathering information. We will withhold comment until we know all the facts."
Calls were not immediately returned Monday from Bowers' defense attorney, Dennis Coppin.
Campbell said that if bail is posted, Bowers will be able to leave New York if he chooses. His next court date is April 25.
It was unclear Monday night whether Bowers had a permit for the gun.

The allure of Augusta: Savoring the Masters magic
By Shane O'Donoghue, CNN
updated 3:01 PM EDT, Wed April 10, 2013
CNN's Living Golf host Shane O'Donoghue played at Augusta in 2005 after winning a lottery among journalists covering that year's Masters.
O'Donoghue, a keen golfer, says the experience of playing at one of the world's most famous courses is something he will "never, ever forget."
Every year, a legendary golfer hits a ceremonial first tee shot before the first round of the Masters. In 2011 Jack Nicklaus (pictured) shared the honors with Arnold Palmer shortly after sunrise.
Augusta's most famous holes are known as "Amen Corner." The first of the three is the 11th -- which is called "White Dogwood." Here Anthony Kim hits a bunker shot at the 2009 Masters.
The "Amen Corner" name was first used in 1958 by author Herbert Warren Wind, and refers to the second shot at the 11th, the whole of the 12th (pictured here) and the tee shot at 13.
Here Bubba Watson hits his tee shot on the 12th hole -- known as "Golden Bell" -- on his way to victory at the 2012 Masters, which was his first major title.
The 13th hole, known as "Azalea," was famously eagled by Byron Nelson in 1937 on his way to winning the Masters. The 16th hole, known as "Redbud," was the scene of one of golf's most famous shots when Tiger Woods holed an incredible chip-in from off the green to claim the 2005 Masters and his fourth Green Jacket.
While "Amen Corner" make make or break a player's hopes, the bunker-lined 18th hole -- known as "Holly" -- is where history is made and Green Jackets are put on the winner.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Augusta National opened in 1933 and first hosted the Masters the following year
The Georgia venue stages the season's opening major tournament in April
Tiger Woods' chip-in at the par-three 16th in 2005 is one of the most famous in golf
That year was the fourth and last time the world No. 1 donned the Green Jacket
Editor's note: CNN's Living Golf host Shane O'Donoghue has been fortunate to play Augusta National on two occasions. Here, he remembers his first time.
(CNN) -- My first visit to Augusta National was in 2005 when I was reporting for Ireland's national television channel RTE. As you can imagine, it was the realization of a lifelong dream.
For the traveling circus of working media, there is an opportunity to place your name in a lottery, with the prize for the precious few who are chosen being a round at the course on the day after the Masters concludes.
To get to play the course was always going to be a long shot, but I had decided to bring my clubs just in case.
The draw is made on the Saturday of the tournament. If you're lucky to play, you are not allowed to enter the draw for another five years, so as to allow the fairest possible chance for those interested in teeing off on one of the world's truly iconic courses.
Bubba Watson cries over Masters memory
CNN Explains: The Masters
Bubba Watson's hovercraft is for real For a first-timer, it was something akin to an out-of-body experience when I was presented with an official invitation to play. I could NOT believe it!
Read: Tiger helps Chinese teen at Augusta
The invitation is framed in our home alongside a 2005 Masters flag and a signed and marked scorecard. More of that anon.
I was to tee off at 0730, starting at the 10th tee. Unbelievable. Literally 15 hours after the leaders Chris DiMarco and a certain Tiger Woods had graced the back nine in the tournament, so would I.
Up early, grooves cleaned and excited beyond belief, I pitched up at the gates of Magnolia Lane and made my way up to the clubhouse to check in, meet my caddy Travis in his traditional white overalls and head to the practice range. My heart was pumping.
I remember hitting a rocket off the tee with a hard draw and I still had a four iron to the green. The adrenaline, combined with a borderline hook, meant I bounced it over the back of the green into a bush. After a few rushed shots that confirmed my amateur status, a double bogey was recorded. We were off and running.
All told, I enjoyed five double bogeys. And they were good doubles! The greens were unbelievable. The bumps and hollows, the scary reads -- we had them all and very early on I told myself to enjoy the experience, because this was not about the score, it was something to be savored.
There were four of us: working press from all over the globe suddenly possessing the wide-eyed stare of excited children, with a glorious invitation to the pristine fairways of Augusta National -- living out our fantasies of actually playing the course.
Boy wonder makes Masters history
Bubba Watson on momentous Masters
I remember playing the 16th and three-putting for a bogey. What they tell you about placing the ball in the correct position below the holes is absolutely true. On this and so many of the greens, there are impossible putts if you don't play the correct approach shot.
What was utterly fascinating was the opportunity to have a go at playing Tiger Woods' chip shot at 16 from the previous day, which is arguably the greatest shot in modern times at Augusta.
Let me confirm, not that it is necessary, that the shot was impossible for mere mortals like myself. The vision to play that shot -- which helped Woods win his fourth Green Jacket -- and the ability to execute it with such perfection was God-like.
In the end, I carded eight pars, five bogeys and those five doubles. A round of 87 of which I'm proud. We played from the members tees, as instructed, but I confess to playing on the Masters tees on all of the par-threes.
There were so many wonderful experiences that day, as I savored the experience and stood in spots where so many iconic shots have been been struck down through the years.
You'll always remember your first time, and for me, it was a day that I will never, ever forget.

HHS chief: President didn't know of Obamacare website woes beforehand
See show times »
By Greg Botelho, CNN
updated 10:29 PM EDT, Wed October 23, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Democratic senator urges Obama to extend enrollment, delay "mandate" penalty Sebelius: Obama didn't know of issues, despite companies' complaints, crash during test run Delaying the website's launch was "not really an option," Sebelius says
She tells CNN an "A-Team" of experts coming in, 3 weeks after launch (CNN) -- President Barack Obama didn't know of problems with the Affordable Care Act's website -- despite insurance companies' complaints and the site's crashing during a test run -- until after its now well-documented abysmal launch, the nation's health chief told CNN on Tuesday.
Rough Obamacare rollout: 4 reasons why
In an exclusive interview with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta asked when the President first learned about the considerable issues with the Obamacare website. Sebelius responded that it was in "the first couple of days" after the site went live October 1.
"But not before that?" Gupta followed up.
To which Sebelius replied, "No, sir."
Sebelius admitted that there is concern in her department and the White House over the technical debacle surrounding the website rollout, saying "no one could be more frustrated than I am and the president." The site was supposed to make it simple for people to search and sign-up for new health care policies starting on October 1, but instead it's been clunky and, at times, inoperable.
"We're not at all satisfied with the workings of the website," Sebelius said. "We want it to be smooth and easy and let consumers compare plans."
Obama: No 'sugarcoating' problems with website
Sebelius: This will be fixed
Sebelius: Obama didn't know until day one
She noted how a team of high-tech experts from within the government and from Silicon Valley, and led by Jeff Zients -- a former CEO and acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, who will oversee the process for the next few months -- is coming to help address the issues. Their arrival was announced earlier Tuesday.
Why weren't they brought in before the website launched October 1?
"We (had) hoped that they had their 'A-Team' on the table" from the start, Sebelius said of the contractors and agencies responsible for the project.
As to now, "We want new eyes and ears. We want to make sure that we get all the questions on the table, that we get all the answers and accelerator the fix as quickly as possible."
The secretary attributed some of the problems to "extremely high" volume, claiming nearly 20 million people came to the Obamacare website in the first three weeks after its launched. Yet only a fraction of those have signed up for new health care policies; Sebelius said Tuesday that 500,000 accounts had been created, but that doesn't mean all those people enrolled in a plan.

It's not like no one saw this coming. A number of insurance companies complained of problems ahead of the October 1 launch, and the website crashed during a test run although just a few hundred users were on it.
Despite the issues, the Obama administration went forward with the website.
Report: Site failed ahead of rollout
"There are people in this country who have waited for decades for affordable health coverage for themselves and their families," said Sebelius, explaining why the launch wasn't pushed back. "...So waiting is not really an option."
Opinion: Obamacare a disaster that needs fixing Republicans -- who, even before the website's launch, had made targeting the program a centerpiece of their agenda, even initially insisting they wouldn't vote to fund the entire government unless Obamacare was defunded or delayed -- have been vociferous critics.
They claim that the website's woes show that Obama's administration and the federal government generally aren't capable of executing what the GOP says was an ill-advised program from the get-go.
"God only knows how much money they've spent, and it's a failure," Sen. Mitch McConnell, the leading Republican in the Senate, said Sunday on CBS. "The government isn't going to be able to get this job done correctly."
On the other side, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire sent a letter to Obama asking that the open enrollment period be extended past March 31, 2014, and that he consider delaying assessment of a penalty to individuals who don't sign up for any health insurance before the so-called "individual mandate" kicks in.
"As you continue to fix problems with the website and the enrollment process, it is critical that the administration be open to modifications that provide greater flexibility for the American people seeking to access health insurance," Shaheen wrote.
Even the man whose name is forever tied to the health care reform has been critical, insisting Monday there's "no excuse for the problems" while at the same time insisting these should not equate to blanket condemnation of the Affordable Care Act as a whole.
Red flags missed on Obamacare site
Obamacare site a 'national embarrassment'
Report: Obamacare site failed early test
Governor: Obamacare is going to work
Jon Stewart, others take on Obamacare
"Nobody's madder than me about the website not working as well as it should," Obama said, "which means it's going to get fixed."
Several top Republicans -- including 2012 vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan -- have called on Sebelius herself to step down due to the program's problems. The secretary skirted questions Tuesday about whether she'd step down, saying only that she works "at the pleasure of the president" and is committed to her job.
"I think my job is to get this fully implemented and to get the website working right," Sebelius told Gupta. "And that's really what I'm focused on."
While refusing to give a timetable Tuesday as to when the website will be fully operational, Sebelius insisted "it's improving every day, and more people are getting through."
"More people are having an easier time," she said, "and we intend to stay at this until we open the door's wide open."
Rubio calls for delay of Obamacare sign-up deadline
And it's too early to call the rollout a failure, the health secretary argued. There's a long way to go for people to take advantage in person, by calling or by using the website during the open-enrollment period.
