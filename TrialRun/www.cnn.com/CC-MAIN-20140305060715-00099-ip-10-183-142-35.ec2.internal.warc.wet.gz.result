Romney wins Iowa straw pollStory Highlights The poll is viewed as a test of candidates' organizational strength in Iowa Romney and Brownback invested the most resources in the straw poll Several candidates chose not to spend the money needed to win the contestNext Article in Politics » Read VIDEO By Mark Preston CNN Political Editor AMES, Iowa (CNN) -- Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney won the Iowa Republican straw poll Saturday, giving his campaign a boost six months before the state holds its first-in-the-nation caucuses. Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney received almost 32 percent of the vote in the Iowa Republican straw poll. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee came in second, followed by Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback. Romney received 4,516 votes, or 31.5 percent of the total. But his victory was slightly overshadowed by low participation from GOP activists and the absence of several opponents. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Arizona Sen. John McCain -- as well as former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson, an unannounced candidate -- chose not to spend the money needed to win the contest. "It is a win," David Yepsen, political columnist with The Des Moines Register, said in an interview. "But it is somewhat shallow, because his big opponents didn't show up. What does it mean to get in the ring and your opponents don't even show up," added Yepsen, who is considered the dean of the Iowa political press corps.

The straw poll was held on the campus of Iowa State University and is viewed as a test of organizational strength in Iowa. In almost every case, the candidates paid the $35 per person fee charged to vote in the straw poll. It's a major fundraiser for the state Republican Party. A malfunctioning voting machine delayed the release of the results by more than an hour, as GOP officials were forced to count more than 1,500 ballots by hand. The candidates set up tents outside Hilton Coliseum to feed supporters, hand out campaign literature, T-shirts and stickers, as well as to allow people to escape the blazing sun. Watch what CNN's Bill Schneider has to say about the Iowa straw poll » Romney and Brownback invested the most resources in the straw poll by paying for the privilege to erect massive tents near the voting entrance.

The former Massachusetts governor had a large outdoor stage with bands and other entertainment performing throughout the day. Brownback offered air conditioning in his tent, which featured a stage for entertainment and a moon bounce and other activities outside for children. The other candidates had much smaller tents scattered around the coliseum. In the middle of the day, the candidates each took the stage inside the coliseum to talk about their vision for America and urge attendees to vote for them. Perhaps anticipating a poor showing at the event, California Rep. Duncan Hunter told CNN hours before the results were announced that he planned to continue his bid for the White House. "I think for the guys who have spent a lot of money here getting their message out, they are going to have to judge whether or not they have done as well as they want to do," Hunter said. "For us, we consider this a start of a marathon. This is just the tip-off." In the next 24 to 72 hours, the GOP presidential field could be winnowed if some of the candidates believe Saturday's showing is an indicator of the lack of support for their campaign. The Iowa Democratic Party does not hold a similar event. E-mail to a friend All About Mitt Romney • Fred Thompson • Rudolph Giuliani • John McCain

New Sotomayor documents detail work of Puerto Rican rights groupStory Highlights Sotomayor once served on the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund Group opposed the 1987 nomination of Robert Bork to the high court Supporters: PRLDEF documents add nothing to the nomination debate Republicans are challenging Sotomayor's record on affirmative action Next Article in Politics » By Bill Mears CNN Supreme Court Producer WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Newly released documents from Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor's service on the board of a Puerto Rican civil rights organization show the group opposed Robert Bork's nomination to the high court more than two decades ago. Judge Sonia Sotomayor is set to face Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Sotomayor, a judge on the New York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, was nominated by President Obama in May to fill the vacancy of retiring Justice David Souter. Her confirmation hearings are set to begin July 13. She served as a board member of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980-92, leaving when she became a federal judge. During her years on the PRLDEF board, the group opposed President Reagan's 1987 nomination of the conservative Bork -- then a federal appeals judge -- "because of the threat he poses to the civil rights of the Latino community," according to the documents. The group's attorneys prepared press releases and "worked on numerous efforts to build coalitions against the nominee," according to the documents. Bork was ultimately rejected by the Senate. The Fund also met in 1987 with staff at the New York Daily News to address what it called "negative images of Puerto Ricans presented by the News' staff," including well-known columnist Jimmy Breslin. Republicans are challenging Sotomayor's record on affirmative action, and the newly released documents on her work at the Fund will likely be a centerpiece of debate at the upcoming confirmation hearings. The 350 pages of documents released Wednesday by the Senate Judiciary Committee show the Fund filed hundreds of discrimination lawsuits over the years on behalf of Hispanics. The documents do not reveal whether Sotomayor was directly involved in them. She was a private attorney at the time, and was volunteering for the group. However, they reflect the Fund's strong push to establish a precedent of cases that would establish legal authority to uphold workplace quotas for minorities. One case dealt with promotions in the New York City Police Department. A May 1992 memo on "litigation highlights" noted, "We obtained quota promotions for Latinos and African Americans to the rank of sergeant." A PRLDEF class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of minority applicants claimed advancement exams were "discriminatory and not job related." The city settled, agreeing to promotions that reflected the percentage of Hispanic test-takers. Backpay and retroactive seniority were also provided. Don't Miss Sotomayor resigns from women's club
Sotomayor says women's club doesn't discriminate
Justice Ginsburg ready to welcome Sotomayor
"As a result," said the memo, "almost 100 Hispanics were promoted, over twice the number that would have been promoted without the settlement." Fast forward 17 years to a case Sotomayor heard as an appeals judge. She and her colleagues rejected a lawsuit by white firefighters in New Haven, Connecticut, after the city threw out the results of promotional exams because too few minorities qualified for advancement. In the case, one Hispanic and 19 white firefighters who scored high on the exams and would have gained captain and lieutenant positions claimed "reverse" discrimination. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the so-called "New Haven 20," concluding "the city rejected the test results solely because the higher scoring candidates were white." Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority said, "No individual should face workplace discrimination based on race." The high court said municipalities would now have to establish "a strong basis of evidence" that promotion tests were unfairly designed or administered before nullifying them, and not simply because too many minorities did poorly. Sotomayor's views in the case have been criticized by some conservatives, saying it shows she supports racial preferences for Hispanic and other minorities. The high court dissent, however, criticized the ruling for reinterpreting what Congress intended. "Congress endeavored to promote equal opportunity in fact, and not simply in form," wrote Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. "The damage today's decision does to that objective is untold." Supporters also contend the PRLDEF documents add nothing to the nomination debate. "Documents that Judge Sotomayor did not write, or approve -- many of them more than two decades old -- are irrelevant to her nomination," according to a White House statement. "The Senate should judge her on her own record -- especially her judicial record -- not on briefs that other lawyers wrote 20 years ago." Opponents, however, claim Sotomayor's prior work for PRLDEF, and her off-the-bench comments reveal doubts about her fairness and impartiality as a judge. In addition, some Republicans on the committee expressed concern the material was released only 12 days before the hearings begin. "This has all the hallmarks of a deliberate delay and an attempt to frustrate a thorough review of this important information," said Stephen Boyd, a spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, ranking Republican on the committee. "If these dilatory tactics continue, it will be increasingly more difficult for the hearing to go forward on July 13." Sotomayor supporters point out a similar "document dump" by the Bush White House in the days before Chief Justice John Roberts testified before the Senate in September 2005. And the Bush administration also refused to turn over material from Justice Samuel Alito's prior service in the Reagan and Bush Justice Departments in the 1980s, arguing his subsequent judicial record was sufficient to determine his qualifications to sit on the high court.

Intriguing people for March 5, 2010By Jay Kernis, CNN New York Gov. David Paterson's office says he intends to challenge the findings of a state ethics panel. STORY HIGHLIGHTS New York Gov. David Paterson's press director resigns; governor also faces ethics charges Mohegan tribe's council picks new female chief Christian conservative loses seat on Texas Board of Education Doctoral student in sociology uses his tattoos for research Editor's note: Every weekday, CNN focuses on a handful of people in the news. This is a chance to find out more about what they've done -- good or bad -- what they've said or what they believe, and why we think they're intriguing. (CNN) -- David Paterson: The New York governor's communications director, Peter Kauffman, resigned Thursday. On Thursday night, three dozen influential black leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, met in Harlem and concluded Paterson should not leave office. On Wednesday, the New York State Commission on Public Integrity accused Paterson of an ethics violation over accepting free tickets to the first game of last year's World Series. Paterson violated the state's restriction on gifts for public officials in October when he sought free tickets to the game in Yankee Stadium between the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies, the commission said. The commission also said Paterson lied under oath about intending to pay for the tickets. "Gov. Paterson maintains his innocence and intends to challenge the findings of the commission both with respect to the law and the facts," the governor's office said. There are also allegations that Paterson and New York State Police tried to influence a witness in a domestic violence case involving one of the governor's staff members. Peterson became New York's 55th governor in March 2008 after Eliot Spitzer resigned following a prostitution scandal. Paterson already has announced he will not seek election this November. In 2004, Paterson, who is legally blind, became the first visually-impaired person to address the Democratic National Convention. He was born in 1954 in to Portia and Basil Paterson, the first non-white secretary of state in New York and the first African-American vice chair of the national Democratic Party. CNN: Top Patterson aide quits CNN: Paterson faces ethics charges over World Series tickets Don McLeroy: The decisions of most boards of educations don't make national headlines. But what the Texas Board of Education decides to do often becomes important news. As the second-largest school system in the nation, the Texas board determines what's in the textbooks that millions of students read in classrooms across the country. So what happened in Tuesday's Republican primary in the Lone Star State made news. McLeroy, an outspoken Christian conservative, lost his seat on the board that he has served on since 1999. He told CNN on Thursday, "I have been a controversial figure. It was a highly contested race." McLeroy said he was candid about speaking up against the "Darwin scientific establishment." He said that he does believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old but that he has never promoted the teaching of creationism or "intelligent design" in science classes or textbooks. "But we did argue for scientific integrity," he said, "which is leaning over backward to show both sides. Instead of selling evolution like it was Frosted Flakes -- where you only promote the added vitamins and not the added sugar -- now our new science standards in Texas require the teaching of evolution's strengths and weaknesses." He said he doesn't believe in the theory of evolution at all, but he does want kids to study it. This week, the National Center for Science Education, a nonprofit group that defends the teaching of evolution in public schools, gave McLeroy its first annual UpChucky Award "bestowed on the most noisome creationist of the year."

McLeroy, a dentist in Bryan-College Station, Texas, earned a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University and a doctor of dental science degree from University of Texas Dental Branch at Houston. He has also been a fourth-grade Sunday school teacher at Grace Bible Church in College Station for 23 years. McLeroy's term on the Texas Board of Education ends this December 31. National Center for Science Education: Announcing the first annual UpChucky award Lynn Malerba: The Council of Elders of the Mohegan Tribe on Thursday announced the selection of Malerba of Uncasville, Connecticut, as the tribe's next chief. It is a lifetime appointment. She becomes the 17th chief in the tribe's history, and USA Today reports that she is the first woman to hold the position since 1723. According to the council, Malerba grew up with an awareness of the Mohegans' struggle for federal recognition, which did not occur until 1994. Malerba is a descendent of Burrill Fielding, a Mohegan chief from 1937 until his death in 1952, and she has served on the Tribal Council, the Mohegan's governing body since 2005. She also has been a nurse, a nurse manager and director of cardiology and pulmonary services at a Connecticut hospital. The tribe has 1,835 members and is mostly known as the operator of the huge Mohegan Sun Casino, which employs nearly 10,000 workers. Global Gaming Business Magazine named Malerba as one of "25 People to Watch" in its January issue. By the way, the Mohegan and the Mahican (or Mohican -- as novelist James Fenimore Cooper called them) are not the same nation. The Mohegan Tribe Kim Elsesser: Why don't George Clooney and Sandra Bullock compete in the same best actor category? Provocative question. "In the 21st century women contend with men for titles ranging from the American president to the American Idol. Clearly, there is no reason to still segregate acting Oscars by sex." That's what Kim Elsesser wrote in her op-ed essay in Thursday's New York Times. Elsesser is a research scholar at the Center for Study of Women at the University of California, Los Angeles. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will honor Hollywood's top artists on Sunday, and Elsesser wrote that, in the case of the Oscars, separate is not equal. "While it is certainly acceptable for sports competitions like the Olympics to have separate events for male and female athletes, the biological differences do not affect acting performances," she wrote in The New York Times piece. "The divided Oscar categories merely insult women, because they suggest that women would not be victorious if the categories were combined." Elsesser, 45, has an MBA and a master's degree in operations research (probability and statistics) from MIT. She also helped to manage a hedge fund on Wall Street. She told CNN on Thursday, "My experiences on Wall Street motivated my studies of gender issues in the workplace." She's interested in the differences between male and female bosses and how women are treated at work. Elsesser, who also has a doctorate is in psychology, said she hopes the academy acts on her suggestion of gender-free categories. "I think the academy is very slow to change. So it may be many years. But I think eventually it will happen." She said she will be watching the awards show Sunday, but as the mother of a 6-year-old son, she hasn't been able to see all the movies that she wanted to. The New York Times: And the gender-neutral Oscar goes to ... UCLA Center for the Study of Women Dave Strohecker: The doctoral student studying sociology at the University of Maryland in College Park said he grew up in a conservative Christian household in the Texas suburbs. So the vast collection of tattoos that covers a lot of his body may come as a surprise. This week, he told The Diamondback campus newspaper, "I started getting tattooed as a way of coping with stress and trauma, particularly that of moving away from home and leaving my family, identity and former life behind. I had a tough transition to college as an undergraduate. Tattooing seemed to help me re-orient myself toward my past, my values and my family." His skin features images representing feminism, gay rights, faith and his family. He's got a dragon head, a robot, crashing waves, a soaring eagle and a skull with a graduation cap. He told CNN on Thursday that tattooing is consistent with his sociology degree work, and he's doing research on it with 20- to 40-year-olds. He said, "I'm trying to figure out if tattooing can be seen not only as deviant behavior, but as beneficial to the individual." Strohecker received his bachelor's degree in sociology from Texas A&M University and has a special interest in studies of white racism and white privilege; in racial, gender, sexual and ethnic discrimination; and the role media play. He intends to cover most of his skin with tattoos one day, but, he said, not his face. Diamondback online: Rebel arms What makes a person intriguing? There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.

Medicare covers yoga for heart disease
By William Hudson, CNN
updated 6:26 PM EST, Mon February 27, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease is covered by Medicare
Patients do yoga, eat a plant-based, meatless diet and meditate regularly
Kathy and Frank Korona have lost 85 pounds on the program (CNN) -- Frank Korona lives near the West Virginia-Pennsylvania border with his wife Kathy, in a house that he built with his own hands, on the same property where he grew up.
He served in the Army Special Forces in Vietnam. The Koronas have a long, proud tradition of military service, but their family's greatest losses have been to heart disease.
"Our family has shrunk tremendously. We've lost so many people through death," Kathy says.
In 1992, Frank's brother Bob died in his arms, suffering a heart attack on their kitchen floor. Parents, siblings, aunts, uncles and cousins have all died from complications from heart disease, too. The Koronas point them out in a graveyard near their home.
Frank and Kathy have both had heart attacks, and both have stents holding their blood vessels open. The birth of their grandson Caleb led them to try harder to extend their lives. So last year, the couple joined the Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease.
Medicare, the government health insurance program for Americans 65 and older, covers the Ornish program, which teaches a plant-based, meatless diet, meditation and regular exercise. The program was officially declared an intensive cardiac rehab program in 2010, and the first patients started in May 2011.
Ornish is a persistent advocate within the halls of government. There are mountains of scientific evidence that his recommended lifestyle changes do reverse heart disease, the No. 1 killer in the United States and worldwide.
Helping patients make these lifestyle changes costs Medicare about $70 per hour, and patients can receive up to 72 one-hour sessions. Proponents of preventative medicine point out that that cost is still much less than operations and medications.
Ornish believes that fear cannot motivate lifestyle change in people long-term. Change has to be about feeling better and having more zest for life. The greater the change, the better the feeling, he says.
Kathy and Frank Korona pose for a photo at a July 2008 wedding reception. That seems to ring true for the Koronas. Despite the grim history of heart disease, they say it's how good they feel that keeps them living the lifestyle that their neighbors sometimes find strange.
"If I was going to be able to participate as a grandparent in his life, that gave me another incentive, that really did," Kathy explains. "But in order to do that, I needed to feel good about myself first."
The Koronas' favorite yoga positions are "cobra" and "fish," and their favorite pizza is meatless meat-lovers, made with soy pepperoni and soy "ground beef."
"Usually at the end of the session, the instructor will say, 'Now the reward, get into the total relaxation pose,' and we do that, and it just feels so good," Kathy says.
Together the Koronas have lost 85 pounds on the program, and Frank is off of four medications.
Hospitals can now bill Medicare for their patient's yoga and group discussion sessions because the Ornish program is an approved intensive cardiac rehab program, a new class of cardiac rehab created by Congress in 2009.
Traditional cardiac rehab, developed in the 1950s and covered by Medicare since 1982, focuses almost exclusively on exercise -- getting patients out of bed and the blood flowing again.
But in the 1970s, Ornish and others began leading experiments to test whether improving diet and stress levels could make a difference for those with heart disease. In the following decades the researchers published volumes of studies in peer-reviewed journals that became the basis of the Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease.
There are four components to the program: nutrition, stress management, moderate exercise and group support.
Part of the underlying cause for widespread heart disease, explains Ornish, is chronic loneliness and isolation, which lead to stress and bad habits. When people feel emotionally close to others, they're physiologically healthier, too, so Medicare is paying for it.
"The reason that I spent 16 years working with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to achieve Medicare coverage for our program is that I knew that most insurance companies follow Medicare's lead. In other words, if Medicare covered our program, most other insurance companies would, as well," explains Ornish, who also says he was once naive in thinking that solid science alone would be enough to change health care policy.
"Reimbursement as well as science are primary determinants of medical practice. If it's not reimbursable, it's not sustainable."

Floyd Mayweather Jr. beats Miguel Cotto to remain undefeated
By Kamal Wallace, CNN
updated 5:43 AM EDT, Sun May 6, 2012
Floyd Mayweather Jr. throws a right to the face of Miguel Cotto during their WBA super welterweight title fight Saturday
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Floyd Mayweather Jr. defeats Miguel Cotto by unanimous decision to claim WBA title
Mayweather remains undefeated in 43 fights Mayweather will head to jail in June to serve three-month sentence
(CNN) -- Floyd Mayweather Jr. had his nose bloodied midway through the fight, but maintained his poise to remain undefeated and claim the WBA junior middleweight title from Miguel Cotto.
Mayweather won by unanimous decision on Saturday night.
The 35-year-old (43-0, 26 KOs) was tested early and often by Cotto (37-3, 32 KOs), but the five-division champion started to pull away in the later rounds.
Two judges scored the fight 117-111 and the third judge gave it 118-110.
After the judges' decision, sold-out crowds booed Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
"When it's pay-per-view and the fans are paying and the fans are coming out to see you, you want to give the fans excitement," Mayweather said.
Cotto, 31, gave Mayweather all he could handle, tagging his competitor with shots to the head most of the night. But Mayweather was more accurate with his punches.
In the end, Cotto earned the respect of his opponent.
"You're a hell of a champion," Mayweather said. "You're the toughest guy I ever fought."
After the fight, Mayweather was asked about the likelihood of facing Manny Pacquiao -- something boxing fans have wanted for years.
"If you're the best, take the test," Mayweather said, referring to his insistence that Pacquaio submit to Olympic-style drug testing and has served as a stumbling block to making the fight happen. Pacquiao has said he would agree to such testing.
Regardless, Mayweather's next fight will have to wait. On June 1, he starts a three-month jail sentence for misdemeanor domestic violence and harassment charges involving a former girlfriend.
Mayweather will make a guaranteed $32 million, which is a state record, according to the Nevada Athletic Commission. Cotto will make $8 million -- the largest purse of his career.

Opinion: A fast-food, sugar fiasco
By Dr. Robert H. Lustig, Special to CNN
updated 4:45 PM EST, Fri January 11, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The fast food industry continues its revenue and profit, doctor says
Many politicians think obesity remains an issue of personal responsibility
Sugar can trigger processes that lead to obesity, other diseases Editor's note: Dr. Robert H. Lustig is professor of Pediatrics at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco. His book, "Fat Chance: Beating the Odds Against Sugar, Processed Food, Obesity and Disease," was released last week. To hear more from Lustig, don't miss "Sanjay Gupta MD" at 4:30 p.m. ET Saturday and 7:30 a.m. ET Sunday. (CNN) -- "My definition of fast food?" Alice Waters said. "Letting someone loose in a garden with a bottle of balsamic vinegar and saying, 'have at it.'"
"(The price of) fast food simply doesn't take account of that meal's true cost -- to soil, oil, public health, the public purse, etc," Michael Pollan said. "Costs which are never charged directly to the consumer but, indirectly and invisibly, to the taxpayer (in the form of subsidies), the health care system (in the form of food-borne illnesses) and obesity, and the environment (in the form of pollution). Not to mention the welfare of the workers in the feedlot and the slaughterhouse and the welfare of the animals themselves." Both these quotes are explanations of what's wrong with the Western diet, the aesthetic and the socio-ecologic. Both are right on target; both are compelling. Yet both are completely powerless to bring about any sort of change in food policy.
Because tastebuds, food-borne illnesses, the environment and animal welfare don't count. Money counts.
The food industry continues its juggernaut of revenues and profits. Despite a sales dip at McDonald's, domestic fast food industry revenues have exhibited a 20% rise, adjusted for inflation, over the past decade, according to Statista, a website that aggregates statistics from more than 18,000 sources. That's despite a U.S. population that grew by only 8.4% over the same interval.
Fast food was worth $184 billion a year in 2010, up from $165 billion in 2009, and is projected to reach $210 billion in 2016, according to Statista. That pales in comparison to the total revenue of the entire food industry: $1 trillion.
The U.S. government has hitched its wagon to the food industry. Our food is the cheapest in the world, made possible in part by federal subsidies to farmers. Yet the United States is the fattest country in the world.
OK, then what about obesity and its associated diseases? Shouldn't that get Washington's attention? After all, we annually waste $44 billion on disability, $73 billion in decreased work productivity and $190 billion in health care because of obesity. Add to that a $2,741 increase in personal annual health insurance premiums to cover these costs, even for normal-weight adults. Medicare will be broke by the year 2024.
Until we get a handle on obesity, all the Obamacare in the world can't stop the ravages of metabolic syndrome or the resultant health care expenditures.
Surely all that money is enough to offset the government's margin on food? Unfortunately in the eyes of politicians, obesity remains an issue of "personal responsibility." Don't blame the industry. Just eat less and exercise more, they say. But then how do you explain our epidemic of obese 6-month-olds? They don't diet and exercise. Something more insidious is going on.
How about the biochemical explanation? Would that hold any more sway with politicians? Scientific evidence now supports the concept that our glut of sugar -- in particular, the molecule fructose, which is what makes sugar sweet -- can trigger processes that lead to the metabolic syndrome.
These include:
-- Hypertension -- fructose increases uric acid, which raises blood pressure.
-- High triglycerides and insulin resistance through synthesis of fat in the liver.
-- Diabetes via increased liver glucose production combined with insulin resistance.
-- The aging process, due to damage to lipids, proteins and DNA through binding of fructose to these molecules.
It can be argued that fructose exerts toxic effects on the liver similar to those of alcohol. Furthermore, sugar, like alcohol, has a clear potential for abuse.
Sugar acts on the brain to encourage subsequent intake by dampening the suppression of the hunger hormone ghrelin. It also interferes with the hormone leptin, which helps produce a feeling of satiety and reduces dopamine signaling in the brain's reward center, thereby reducing the pleasure derived from food.
The majority of foods are laced with added sugar, thus effectively co-opting your choice. Where there's no choice, how can there be personal responsibility?
Need more science? How about the lack of fiber in the Western diet, which was removed partially to increase shelf life?
Lack of fiber in processed food means rapid absorption and overloading the liver, higher levels of "bad" cholesterol, proliferation of obesogenic bacterial species in the intestine, and slower transit of food through the intestine, delaying the onset of the satiety signal.
Here's my definition of fast food: fiberless food. Fast cooking (white rice cooks in half the time of brown rice), and fast eating. And fast absorption from the GI tract, overloading the liver, driving insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, while increasing total food consumption. It's a vicious cycle.
So there you have it. A Faustian bargain to be sure: your time or your health; your wallet or your health.
Government's job is to generate money. Public health spends money, with the hope of eventually saving money. The food supply has not changed; it has only gotten worse.
Public health policies for obesity prevention thus far have not worked, and the president and Congress can't justify spending more money on this. But both the science and the balance sheet say otherwise.
Robbing us to pay both Peter and Paul. It's time for government to step up and amend our current food policy — for the aesthetic, for the socio-ecologic and for the biochemical damage that it is doing to America.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Robert Lustig.

Will Rolling Stone's Dzhokhar Tsarnaev cover hurt sales?
By Josh Levs, CNN
updated 4:05 PM EDT, Tue July 23, 2013
Bloomberg Businessweek's November 4 issue addresses the technical problems that have riddled the HealthCare.gov website since its launch October 1. Click through the gallery to look at other controversial magazine covers through the years.
With hair covering a portion of her face, and a loose-fitting coat that reveals little skin, some critics have said that Elle magazine's November cover of actress Melissa McCarthy is fat-shaming. In response, Elle posted a follow-up item on its website that read in part, "On all of our shoots, our stylists work with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in, and this is no different: Melissa loved this look, and is gorgeous on our cover." New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner found himself in hot water once again after admitting he had online relationships with three women after his 2011 resignation from Congress. The New Yorker magazine's August 5 cover depicts Weiner as King Kong, taking a photo with a cell phone atop the Empire State Building.
Rolling Stone magazine made headlines because of the photo of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover of its July 19 issue. Tsarnaev is a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing in which three people died and more than 170 were injured. The photograph originally was posted by Tsarnaev online and had previously circulated around the Internet. Public backlash was almost immediate. Rolling Stone defended itself, saying the cover story reflected its commitment to "serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day."
Time magazine's April 8 double cover drew controversy as the Supreme Court took up two cases centered on same-sex marriage laws.
Time magazine's May 21, 2012, cover caused a stir because of the female subject's mostly exposed breast and the age of her son. Newsweek in May 2012 declared Barack Obama the "first gay president." The cover reflected the president's public support of same-sex marriage and came during his re-election campaign. Some media pundits and historians argued that James Buchanan was likely the first gay president.
A Bloomberg Businessweek cover in February 2012 addressed the merger between United and Continental airlines with one plane on top of the other and the headline "Let's Get It On." It was recognized by the American Society of Magazine Editors as the year's best cover among business and technology magazines.
From left, "True Blood" stars Alexander Skarsgard, Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer appeared naked and covered in blood on the September 2010 cover of Rolling Stone. Alan Ball, the creator of the hit HBO series, told the magazine: "To me, vampires are sex. I don't get a vampire story about abstinence." While fans of the show were likely not taken aback by the nude threesome, the cover had some people calling for it to be pulled from shelves.
The September 14, 2009, cover of Newsweek asked, "Is your baby racist?" Researchers at the University of Texas found that children as young as 6 months judge people based on the color of their skin. Among the story's critics were conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who said: "Apparently being born white automatically makes you a racist -- which, to me, is just another example of what obsessive racists the leftists actually are."
The New Yorker's July 21, 2008, cover drew mostly outrage for its depiction of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama dressed like Osama bin Laden and Michelle Obama with an exaggerated afro dressed in combat gear. The Obama campaign blasted the cover as "tasteless and insensitive," while the magazine said the cartoon was intended to satirize the "lies and misconceptions and distortions about the Obamas and their background and their politics" that were circulating four months before the election.
New York magazine featured Eliot Spitzer on its cover in March 2008, a month after he resigned as governor, with the word "brain" pointing to his crotch. Spitzer was stopped in his political tracks when his liaisons with high-paid escort Ashley Dupre surfaced, leading to his resignation. The magazine devoted three articles to dissecting his downfall.
The American Conservative portrayed Rudy Giuliani dressed in a uniform reminiscent of those worn by Hitler's SS on January 14, 2008, during the then-New York mayor's bid for the presidency. In a cover story, Glenn Greenwald wrote that Giuliani would be "an authoritarian president with the ultimate fantasy: the ability to wield more power than any other human being in the world, with the fewest real limits in modern American history." The cover was slammed by both conservative and liberal commentators.
In January 2007, Texas Monthly referenced an old issue of National Lampoon when they put an armed Dick Cheney on the cover with the headline: "If you don't buy this magazine, Dick Cheney will shoot you in the face." The then-vice president accidentally shot and wounded his friend while quail hunting in South Texas the previous year. The liberal news magazine was giving him its satirical "Bum Steer of the Year" award.
Some television networks pulled Ellen DeGeneres' show after Time released its April 17, 1997, cover revealing her sexual orientation.
The Economist's September 10, 1994, North American cover, which dealt with a surge in corporate mergers, raised eyebrows. "Camels do it, birds and bees do it, even companies do it: all over America, firms are falling in love and settling down together," Deputy Editor Emma Duncan wrote in an article about Economist covers that made news in and of themselves.
Time's June 27, 1994, cover featuring O.J. Simpson's mugshot was widely criticized because the image had been darkened compared with other magazine covers that had used the same image. The cover was viewed as racist because it portrayed Simpson as a darker-skinned man and gave him a more menacing demeanor. Time's managing editor at the time, James R. Gaines, released a statement saying that neither racial implications nor imputation of guilt were intended.
Janet Jackson was featured on the September 1993 cover of Rolling Stone with a pair of hands covering her breasts. The photograph came from a session Patrick Demarchelier shot while producing artwork for the cover of the sexually charged "Janet" album. "We had a choice of shooting her ourselves," Laurie Kratochvil, Rolling Stone's director of photography, told the Los Angeles Times. "But they offered us this and the image is very powerful." The provocative image shocked the world and established Jackson's status as a sex symbol.
In 1987, Newsweek caused a stir when it ran a cover of Vice President George H. W. Bush titled "Fighting the 'Wimp Factor.' " It was a year before the election that would promote Bush to the presidency, at a time when the country was debating his qualifications. The magazine resurfaced the "Wimp Factor" phrase in 2012, this time referring to GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney.
A woman in a meat grinder was on the cover of Hustler in June 1978 alongside a quote from publisher Larry Flynt: "We will no longer hang women up like pieces of meat." It was his response to feminists' claim that women in pornography are treated like pieces of meat, and the gory cover led to more nationwide protests against the magazine.
In January 1973, the cover of humor magazine National Lampoon featured a dog with a revolver pointed at its head and the famous caption, "If You Don't Buy This Magazine, We'll Kill This Dog." In October 1971, American model Darine Stern made history by becoming the first black woman to appear by herself on the cover of Playboy. It was considered controversial at a time when black women rarely graced the covers of major magazines. The iconic image went on to inspire Playboy's November 2009 cover that featured Marge Simpson as the magazine's first cartoon cover model.
Time magazine's April 8, 1966, cover, and a related article discussing the "death of God movement," drew immediate backlash.
The media played a large role in the American public's perception of the Vietnam War, and Life magazine's November 26, 1965, cover stirred the pot more by showing the "blunt reality of war."
Time declared Adolf Hitler its Man of the Year in the January 2, 1939, issue, just eight months before Germany's invasion of Poland triggered World War II. The issues for Time's Man of the Year, now known as Person of the Year, sometimes run into controversy, but the magazine has shown that its choice often is anything but an endorsement. In the case of Hitler, Time wrote that, among many other things, Hitler had "torn the Treaty of Versailles to shreds," and described the events leading up to the annexation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 as "ruthless" and "methodical."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Retailers boycotting the issue might not have a big impact on sales
Rolling Stone's circulation is 95% subscription
Controversy sometimes increases magazine sales
The magazine's ad page figures dropped in 2012, but have risen in 2013
(CNN) -- The outrage is clear, but the impact on Rolling Stone's bottom line is not.
As some retailers refuse to sell the latest issue, featuring a controversial photo of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover, it seems inevitable that some people who might have picked up a copy now won't.
But any immediate loss could be minuscule for Rolling Stone overall. And recent history suggests that the frenzy could ultimately help move copies.
"It is absolutely impossible to predict what newsstands sales are going to be," Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana told NPR after the anger erupted. "... It's something you have to be mindful of, but at the same time, put out of your mind on a case-by-case basis. ...We really go with our gut on these things, usually."

"Rolling Stone" cover outrage
While the focus has largely been on newsstand sales, they account for only a tiny portion of the magazine's overall circulation. Rolling Stone's circulation is 95% subscription, accounting for about 1.4 million copies. The remaining 5%, about 75,000 copies, comes from individual sales.
Rolling Stone did not immediately respond Tuesday to a CNN request for information on how the latest issue is selling.

While social media is full of messages calling for a boycott -- as well as posts defending and supporting the cover -- uproars can sometimes increase sales.
Ad Age puts it this way: "Outrage aside, controversial magazine covers often pay."
Share your view
It points to recent covers of Bloomberg Businessweek. One had "phallic cover art" about hedge funds; another, about airline mergers, was "illustrated by an image of two planes seemingly having sex."
Opinion: Rolling Stone is right, the backlash is wrong
The "more buzzy covers" have lifted sales by up to 70% above yearly average, an official with Bloomberg Businessweek told Ad Age.
A Time issue last year with a cover showing a woman breastfeeding her 5-year-old son led to complaints, and some retailers refused to sell it. The issue went on to sell slightly above average, according to Ad Age.
Rolling Stone sales: a mixed picture
Some critics call the Rolling Stone cover a desperate effort to boost sales.
Rolling Stone's circulation has stayed relatively steady, edging slightly upward, in recent years. The Audit Bureau of Circulations (which recently changed its name to the Alliance for Audited Media) calculates 1.45 million sales in 2007, and 1.48 million in 2011.
McCain: Rolling Stone cover was stupid
Recent ad page figures -- a metric often used to determine a magazine's health -- show a mixed picture. Rolling Stone's ad pages jumped 5% in the first half of 2013, "after a slow 2012 in which the magazine saw its ad pages decline 14.4%," Ad Age reported.
Much of the magazine industry has been suffering a loss in ad pages. In the first half of this year, the five major news magazines lost a combined 18% compared with the same period last year, according to the Pew Research Center.
Amid all the talk about Rolling Stone's cover, some say the focus on the story itself inside the magazine has been lost.
The lengthy piece looks at how Tsarnaev -- as the cover puts it -- "fell into radical Islam and became a monster."

D. President's Day (February 19) Break-up According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President terminated their
relationship (only temporarily, as it happened), on Monday,
February 19, 1996 -- President's Day. The President was in the
Oval Office from 11 a.m. to 2:01 p.m. that day.(242) He had no
telephone calls between 12:19 and 12:42 p.m.(243) Records do not
reflect Ms. Lewinsky's presence at the White House. In Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, the President telephoned her
at her Watergate apartment that day. From the tone of his voice,
she could tell something was wrong. She asked to come see him,
but he said he did not know how long he would be there.(244) Ms.
Lewinsky went to the White House, then walked to the Oval Office
sometime between noon and 2 p.m. (the only time she ever went to
the Oval Office uninvited).(245) Ms. Lewinsky recalled that she was
admitted by a tall, slender, Hispanic plainclothes agent on duty
near the door.(246)
The President told her that he no longer felt right about
their intimate relationship, and he had to put a stop to it.(247) Ms. Lewinsky was welcome to continue coming to visit him, but
only as a friend. He hugged her but would not kiss her.(248) At
one point during their conversation, the President had a call
from a sugar grower in Florida whose name, according to Ms.
Lewinsky, was something like "Fanuli." In Ms. Lewinsky's
recollection, the President may have taken or returned the call
just as she was leaving.(249)
Ms. Lewinsky's account is corroborated in two respects. First, Nelson U. Garabito, a plainclothes Secret Service agent,
testified that, on a weekend or holiday while Ms. Lewinsky worked
at the White House (most likely in the early spring of 1996), Ms.
Lewinsky appeared in the area of the Oval Office carrying a
folder and said, "I have these papers for the President."(250) After knocking, Agent Garabito opened the Oval Office door, told
the President he had a visitor, ushered Ms. Lewinsky in, and
closed the door behind her.(251) When Agent Garabito's shift ended
a few minutes later, Ms. Lewinsky was still in the Oval Office.(252) Second, concerning Ms. Lewinsky's recollection of a call
from a sugar grower named "Fanuli," the President talked with
Alfonso Fanjul of Palm Beach, Florida, from 12:42 to 1:04 p.m.(253) Mr. Fanjul had telephoned a few minutes earlier, at 12:24 p.m.(254) The Fanjuls are prominent sugar growers in Florida.(255) E. Continuing Contacts After the break-up on February 19, 1996, according to Ms.
Lewinsky, "there continued to sort of be this flirtation . . .
when we'd see each other."(256) After passing Ms. Lewinsky in a
hallway one night in late February or March, the President
telephoned her at home and said he was disappointed that, because
she had already left the White House for the evening, they could
not get together. Ms. Lewinsky testified that the call "sort of
implied to me that he was interested in starting up again."(257) On
March 10, 1996, Ms. Lewinsky took a visiting friend, Natalie
Ungvari, to the White House. They bumped into the President, who
said to Ms. Ungvari when Ms. Lewinsky introduced them: "You must
be her friend from California."(258) Ms. Ungvari was "shocked" that
the President knew where she was from.(259)
Ms. Lewinsky testified that on Friday, March 29, 1996, she
was walking down a hallway when she passed the President, who was
wearing the first necktie she had given him. She asked where he
had gotten the tie, and he replied: "Some girl with style gave
it to me."(260) Later, he telephoned her at her desk and asked if
she would like to see a movie. His plan was that she would
position herself in the hallway by the White House Theater at a
certain time, and he would invite her to join him and a group of
guests as they entered. Ms. Lewinsky responded that she did not
want people to think she was lurking around the West Wing
uninvited.(261) She asked if they could arrange a rendezvous over
the weekend instead, and he said he would try.(262) Records confirm
that the President spent the evening of March 29 in the White
House Theater.(263) Mrs. Clinton was in Athens, Greece.(264)
F. March 31 Sexual Encounter
On Sunday, March 31, 1996, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she
and the President resumed their sexual contact.(265) Ms. Lewinsky
was at the White House from 10:21 a.m. to 4:27 p.m. on that
day.(266) The President was in the Oval Office from 3:00 to 5:46
p.m.(267) His only call while in the Oval Office was from 3:06 to
3:07 p.m.(268) Mrs. Clinton was in Ireland.(269)
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at
her desk and suggested that she come to the Oval Office on the
pretext of delivering papers to him.(270) She went to the Oval
Office and was admitted by a plainclothes Secret Service agent.(271) In her folder was a gift for the President, a Hugo Boss
necktie.(272)
In the hallway by the study, the President and Ms. Lewinsky
kissed. On this occasion, according to Ms. Lewinsky, "he focused
on me pretty exclusively," kissing her bare breasts and fondling
her genitals.(273) At one point, the President inserted a cigar
into Ms. Lewinsky's vagina, then put the cigar in his mouth and
said: "It tastes good."(274) After they were finished, Ms.
Lewinsky left the Oval Office and walked through the Rose
Garden.(275)
IV. April 1996: Ms. Lewinsky's Transfer to the Pentagon
With White House and Secret Service employees remarking on
Ms. Lewinsky's frequent presence in the West Wing, a deputy chief
of staff ordered Ms. Lewinsky transferred from the White House to
the Pentagon. On April 7 -- Easter Sunday -- Ms. Lewinsky told
the President of her dismissal. He promised to bring her back
after the election, and they had a sexual encounter.
A. Earlier Observations of Ms. Lewinsky in the West Wing
Ms. Lewinsky's visits to the Oval Office area had not gone
unnoticed. Officer Fox testified that "it was pretty commonly
known that she did frequent the West Wing on the weekends."(276) Another Secret Service uniformed officer, William Ludtke III,
once saw her exit from the pantry near the Oval Office; she
seemed startled and possibly embarrassed to be spotted.(277) Officer John Muskett testified that "if the President was known
to be coming into the Diplomatic Reception Room, a lot of times
[Ms. Lewinsky] just happened to be walking down the corridor, you
know, maybe just to see the President."(278) Ms. Lewinsky
acknowledged that she tried to position herself to see the
President.(279)
Although they could not date them precisely, Secret Service
officers and agents testified about several occasions when Ms.
Lewinsky and the President were alone in the Oval Office. William C. Bordley, a former member of the Presidential
Protective Detail, testified that in late 1995 or early 1996, he
stopped Ms. Lewinsky outside the Oval Office because she did not
have her pass.(280) The President opened the Oval Office door,
indicated to Agent Bordley that Ms. Lewinsky's presence was all
right, and ushered Ms. Lewinsky into the Oval Office.(281) Agent
Bordley saw Ms. Lewinsky leave about half an hour later.(282) Another former member of the Presidential Protective Detail,
Robert C. Ferguson, testified that one Saturday in winter, the
President told him that he was expecting "some staffers."(283) A
short time later, Ms. Lewinsky arrived and said that "[t]he
President needs me."(284) Agent Ferguson announced Ms. Lewinsky and
admitted her to the Oval Office.(285) About 10 or 15 minutes later,
Agent Ferguson rotated to a post on the Colonnade outside the
Oval Office.(286) He glanced through the window into the Oval
Office and saw the President and Ms. Lewinsky go through the door
leading toward the private study.(287)
Deeming her frequent visits to the Oval Office area a
"nuisance," one Secret Service Officer complained to Evelyn
Lieberman, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations.(288) Ms.
Lieberman was already aware of Ms. Lewinsky. In December 1995,
according to Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Lieberman chided her for being in
the West Wing and told her that interns are not permitted around
the Oval Office. Ms. Lewinsky (who had begun her Office of
Legislative Affairs job) told Ms. Lieberman that she was not an
intern anymore. After expressing surprise that Ms. Lewinsky had
been hired, Ms. Lieberman said she must have Ms. Lewinsky
confused with someone else.(289) Ms. Lieberman confirmed that she
reprimanded Ms. Lewinsky, whom she considered "what we used to
call a 'clutch' . . . always someplace she shouldn't be."(290)
In Ms. Lewinsky's view, some White House staff members
seemed to think that she was to blame for the President's evident
interest in her: [P]eople were wary of his weaknesses, maybe, and . . . they
didn't want to look at him and think that he could be
responsible for anything, so it had to all be my fault . . .
I was stalking him or I was making advances towards him.(292)
B. Decision to Transfer Ms. Lewinsky Ms. Lieberman testified that, because Ms. Lewinsky was so
persistent in her efforts to be near the President, "I decided to
get rid of her."(293) First she consulted Chief of Staff Panetta. According to Mr. Panetta, Ms. Lieberman told him about a woman on
the staff who was "spending too much time around the West Wing." Because of "the appearance that it was creating," Ms. Lieberman
proposed to move her out of the White House. Mr. Panetta -- who
testified that he valued Ms. Lieberman's role as "a tough
disciplinarian" and "trusted her judgment" -- replied, "Fine."(294) Although Ms. Lieberman said she could not recall having
heard any rumors linking the President and Ms. Lewinsky, she
acknowledged that "the President was vulnerable to these kind of
rumors . . . yes, yes, that was one of the reasons" for moving
Ms. Lewinsky out of the White House.(295) Later, in September 1997,
Marcia Lewis (Ms. Lewinsky's mother) complained about her
daughter's dismissal to Ms. Lieberman, whom she met at a Voice of
America ceremony. Ms. Lieberman, according to Ms. Lewis,
responded by "saying something about Monica being cursed because
she's beautiful." Ms. Lewis gathered from the remark that Ms.
Lieberman, as part of her effort to protect the President, "would
want to have pretty women moved out."(296) Most people understood that the principal reason for Ms.
Lewinsky's transfer was her habit of hanging around the Oval
Office and the West Wing.(297) In a memo in October 1996, John
Hilley, Assistant to the President and Director of Legislative
Affairs, reported that Ms. Lewinsky had been "got[ten] rid of" in
part "because of 'extracurricular activities'" (a phrase, he
maintained in the grand jury, that meant only that Ms. Lewinsky
was often absent from her work station).(298) White House officials arranged for Ms. Lewinsky to get
another job in the Administration.(299) "Our direction is to make
sure she has a job in an Agency," Patsy Thomasson wrote in an
email message on April 9, 1996.(300) Ms. Thomasson's office
(Presidential Personnel) sent Ms. Lewinsky's resume to Charles
Duncan, Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense and White
House Liaison, and asked him to find a Pentagon opening for
her.(301) Mr. Duncan was told that, though Ms. Lewinsky had
performed her duties capably, she was being dismissed for hanging
around the Oval Office too much.(302) According to Mr. Duncan --
who had received as many as 40 job referrals per day from the
White House -- the White House had never given such an
explanation for a transfer.(303) C. Ms. Lewinsky's Notification of Her Transfer
On Friday, April 5, 1996, Timothy Keating, Staff Director
for Legislative Affairs, informed Ms. Lewinsky that she would
have to leave her White House job.(304) According to Mr. Keating,
he told her that she was not being fired, merely "being given a
different opportunity." In fact, she could tell people it was a
promotion if she cared to do so.(305) Upon hearing of her
dismissal, Ms. Lewinsky burst into tears and asked if there was
any way for her to stay in the White House, even without pay.(306) No, Mr. Keating said. According to Ms. Lewinsky, "He told me I
was too sexy to be working in the East Wing and that this job at
the Pentagon where I'd be writing press releases was a sexier
job."(307)
Ms. Lewinsky was devastated. She felt that she was being
transferred simply because of her relationship with the
President.(308) And she feared that with the loss of her White
House job, "I was never going to see the President again. I
mean, my relationship with him would be over."(309) D. Conversations with the President about Her Transfer
1. Easter Telephone Conversations and Sexual Encounter
On Easter Sunday, April 7, 1996, Ms. Lewinsky told the
President of her dismissal and they had a sexual encounter. Ms.
Lewinsky entered the White House at 4:56 and left at 5:28 p.m.(310) The President was in the Oval Office all afternoon, from 2:21 to
7:48 p.m.(311)
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President telephoned her at
home that day. After they spoke of the death of the Commerce
Secretary the previous week, she told him of her dismissal:
I had asked him . . . if he was doing okay with Ron Brown's
death, and then after we talked about that for a little bit
I told him that my last day was Monday. And . . . he seemed
really upset and sort of asked me to tell him what had
happened. So I did and I was crying and I asked him if I
could come see him, and he said that that was fine.(312)
At the White House, according to Ms. Lewinsky, she told Secret
Service Officer Muskett that she needed to deliver papers to the
President.(313) Officer Muskett admitted her to the Oval Office,
and she and the President proceeded to the private study.(314)
According to Ms. Lewinsky, the President seemed troubled
about her upcoming departure from the White House: He told me that he thought that my being transferred had
something to do with him and that he was upset. He said,
"Why do they have to take you away from me? I trust you." And then he told me -- he looked at me and he said, "I
promise you if I win in November I'll bring you back like
that."(315)
He also indicated that she could have any job she wanted after
the election.(316) In addition, the President said he would find
out why Ms. Lewinsky was transferred and report back to her.(317) When asked if he had promised to get Ms. Lewinsky another
White House job, the President told the grand jury:
What I told Ms. Lewinsky was that . . . I would do what I
could to see, if she had a good record at the Pentagon, and
she assured me she was doing a good job and working hard,
that I would do my best to see that the fact that she had
been sent away from the Legislative Affairs section did not
keep her from getting a job in the White House, and that is,
in fact, what I tried to do. . . . But I did not tell her I
would order someone to hire her, and I never did, and I
wouldn't do that. It wouldn't be right.(318)
Ms. Lewinsky, when asked if the President had said that he would
bring her back to the White House only if she did a good job at
the Pentagon, responded: "No."(319)
After this Easter Sunday conversation, the President and Ms.
Lewinsky had a sexual encounter in the hallway, according to Ms.
Lewinsky.(320) She testified that the President touched her breasts
with his mouth and hands.(321) According to Ms. Lewinsky: "I think
he unzipped [his pants] . . . because it was sort of this running
joke that I could never unbutton his pants, that I just had
trouble with it."(322) Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex. The
President did not ejaculate in her presence.(323) During this encounter, someone called out from the Oval
Office that the President had a phone call.(324) He went back to
the Oval Office for a moment, then took the call in the study. The President indicated that Ms. Lewinsky should perform oral sex
while he talked on the phone, and she obliged.(325) The telephone
conversation was about politics, and Ms. Lewinsky thought the
caller might be Dick Morris.(326) White House records confirm that
the President had one telephone call during Ms. Lewinsky's visit: from "Mr. Richard Morris," to whom he talked from 5:11 to 5:20
p.m.(327) A second interruption occurred a few minutes later,
according to Ms. Lewinsky. She and the President were in the
study.(328) Ms. Lewinsky testified:
Harold Ickes has a very distinct voice and . . . I heard him
holler "Mr. President," and the President looked at me and I
looked at him and he jetted out into the Oval Office and I
panicked and . . . thought that maybe because Harold was so
close with the President that they might just wander back
there and the President would assume that I knew to leave.(329)
Ms. Lewinsky testified that she exited hurriedly through the
dining room door.(330) That evening, the President called and asked
Ms. Lewinsky why she had run off. "I told him that I didn't know
if he was going to be coming back . . . . [H]e was a little
upset with me that I left."(331) In addition to the record of the Dick Morris phone call, the
testimony of Secret Service Officer Muskett corroborates Ms.
Lewinsky's account. Officer Muskett was posted near the door to
the Oval Office on Easter Sunday.(332) He testified that Ms.
Lewinsky (whom he knew) arrived at about 4:45 p.m. carrying a
manila folder and seeming "a little upset."(333) She told Officer
Muskett that she needed to deliver documents to the President.(334) Officer Muskett or the plainclothes agent on duty with him opened
the door, and Ms. Lewinsky entered.(335) About 20 to 25 minutes later, according to Officer Muskett,
the telephone outside the Oval Office rang. The White House
operator said that the President had an important call but he was
not picking up.(336) The agent working alongside Officer Muskett
knocked on the door to the Oval Office. When the President did
not respond, the agent entered. The Oval Office was empty, and
the door leading to the study was slightly ajar.(337) (Ms. Lewinsky
testified that the President left the door ajar during their
sexual encounters.(338)) The agent called out, "Mr. President?" There was no response. The agent stepped into the Oval Office
and called out more loudly, "Mr. President?" This time there was
a response from the study area, according to Officer Muskett: "Huh?" The agent called out that the President had a phone call,
and the President said he would take it.(339) A few minutes later, according to Officer Muskett, Mr. Ickes
approached and said he needed to see President Clinton. Officer
Muskett admitted him through Ms. Currie's office.(340) Less than a
minute after Mr. Ickes entered Ms. Currie's reception area,
according to Officer Muskett, the pantry or dining room door
closed audibly. Officer Muskett stepped down the hall to check
and saw Ms. Lewinsky walking away briskly.(341)
At 5:30 p.m., two minutes after Ms. Lewinsky left the White
House, the President called the office of the person who had
decided to transfer Ms. Lewinsky, Evelyn Lieberman.(342) Previous Next
