Medicating prisoners for execution: A ruling raises more questions
By Sherry F. ColbFindLaw ColumnistSpecial to CNN

FINDLAWFOR THE PUBLICSelect a topicAutosBankruptcyConsumerCriminal LawDivorceEmploymentEstate PlanningFamilyImmigrationLandlord-TenantPersonal InjuryTaxes Legal commentary from FindLaw's WritLAW DICTIONARY (FindLaw) -- In early February, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit decided the case of Singleton v. Norris. The court there approved the forcible medication of death row inmates who would otherwise be incompetent � that is, too mentally impaired � to be executed.
In justifying its decision, the court explained that it had balanced the government's interest in carrying out a scheduled execution, against the inmate's right not to endure forcible medical treatment. In that balancing, the court said, the state's interest had prevailed.
The result the court reached exposes the peculiar consequences of a legal doctrine that requires that a prisoner be "competent" before he can be executed.
The legal doctrine of competency to be executed
In Ford v. Wainwright, the U.S. Supreme Court held that executing a person who is incapable of comprehending what is happening to him or why violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments. The Court's opinion provides an array of possible rationales for this holding but does not express a preference among them.
According to some, insanity is its own punishment. Others believe that people about to die should be able to prepare to meet their maker. There are also those who say that to execute the insane is arbitrary and thus has no educative or deterrent value. Some theorize further that true retribution requires a comprehending target. And people have additionally argued that an insane inmate cannot help his lawyer obtain a last-minute stay of execution.
The idea of competence for punishment is unique to the death penalty. If John Doe is sentenced to a term of imprisonment and later goes out of his mind, the state may continue to keep him in the penitentiary for the duration of his sentence. Though Doe might receive medical treatment as a prisoner, the constitutionality of his remaining in prison does not hinge on the outcome of that treatment.
Ordinarily, a person who has been lawfully tried, convicted, and sentenced will be punished, regardless of whether he later becomes mentally incapacitated. One need not be "competent for incarceration."
The problem of declining sanity on death row
Readers may wonder how it is that an insane person winds up on death row in the first place. After all, if a person is insane at the time of his crime, then he should qualify in most states for acquittal by reason of insanity.
The reason for this odd state of affairs is that even if a defendant is sane at the time of her crime, the experience of living on death row can lead her to descend into madness. And under Ford, if she does, then the state cannot execute her -- no matter what her mental state might have been at a previous time.
Prosecutors have thus become advocates of forcibly medicating death row inmates, and judges are left to decide the legality of this practice.
The right to refuse medical treatment
Under most circumstances, every person in the United States has a privacy right to refuse medical treatment, even if the treatment in question is necessary to save the person's life. The issue in Singleton is whether that right applies when the treatment in question is necessary to end the person's life.
The Supreme Court has addressed a few of the concerns embedded in this issue. These precedents, however, ultimately shed only limited light on whether the Eighth Circuit's decision was correct.
The first concern is whether a patient can be forcibly medicated to achieve an objective that is separate from the patient's own wellbeing. Requiring vaccinations (a measure that the Court has upheld), rests on such a foundation: although the vaccine is intended to protect the person who is vaccinated, it is also mandated as a means of protecting the rest of the population from a contagious disease.
More specifically regarding the prison context, the Supreme Court ruled in Washington v. Harper that forcibly medicating a dangerous prisoner with antipsychotic drugs was permissible if the drugs were in the prisoner's medical interest. The fact that the medication facilitated prison security and order did not undermine the constitutionality of the treatment.
The second concern embedded in the Singleton dilemma is whether the determination of a person's medical interests should encompass the legal consequences that follows from forcible treatment. In Riggins v. Nevada, the Supreme Court considered whether a criminal defendant could be forcibly medicated to maintain his competence to stand trial. On the particular facts, the Court found that the State of Nevada had not adequately proved that antipsychotic drugs were necessary to that end.
Furthermore, the Court said, the possibility that antipsychotic medication could distort the defendant's affect or dull his emotional investment in the outcome of the proceeding militated strongly against forcible medication of defendants during trial.
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a separate concurrence "to express [his] view that absent an extraordinary showing by the State, the Due Process Clause prohibits prosecuting officials from administering involuntary doses of antipsychotic medicines for purposes of rendering the accused competent for trial, and to express doubt that the showing can be made in most cases, given our present understanding of the properties of these drugs."
Why the Supreme Court's precedents don't resolve the Singleton case
Neither Harper nor Riggins definitively answers the Singleton question. Granted, the Court in Harper does not balk at the potential for ulterior motives in medicating prisoners. But it is also true that maintaining order in a prison is not inherently antithetical to the prisoner's medical interests; indeed, it could further those interests by preventing a psychotic prisoner's violence toward himself. It is difficult to say the same of execution.
Riggins, on the other hand, does raise barriers to forcible medication for trial competency. But its primary worry is the defendant's ability to assist in his own defense, rather than the privacy right against forcible treatment.
The Riggins Court, moreover, does not appear to classify a potentially unfair trial (at which, for example, the defendant makes strange faces and comes across to jurors as indifferent) as an undesirable medical consequence of treatment. Instead, the Court considers it a Sixth Amendment problem.
Practicing offensive medicine
Prisoners, as a general matter, have fewer and less robust constitutional entitlements than the rest of the population. For that reason, the right to refuse medical treatment is not unqualified among prisoners, even under circumstances in which it would be for free people.
Furthermore, in Singleton's particular case, the drugs to be administered are helpful and, in the absence of a scheduled execution, Singleton concedes, he would willingly take them. Singleton's interest is simply in avoiding execution, an interest that no longer carries constitutional weight.
The court of appeals put the matter starkly: "Singleton's argument regarding his long-term medical interest boils down to an assertion that execution is not in his medical interest. Eligibility for execution is the only unwanted consequence of the medication."
To understand why this issue is agonizing for many, consider two analogies. First, suppose that an inmate scheduled to be executed by hanging is not heavy enough for the hanging machinery to kill him instantaneously.
In the light of Eighth Amendment precedents, the state Supreme Court finds that the prisoner may not be hanged at his current weight. To make him eligible for execution, the state proposes force-feeding the condemned, who is admittedly underweight and would be healthier if he were fifteen pounds heavier. Can force-feeding occur?
Second, imagine that an inmate scheduled to be executed becomes comatose and therefore incompetent to be executed. There are various treatments that would probably revive the prisoner, but he has left an advance directive indicating that he does not want to be treated if he becomes comatose, unless his sentence is first commuted to life imprisonment. The state proposes treating the prisoner despite his expression of intent. Can he be brought out of the coma against his will?
In both of these cases, there is something vaguely grotesque about utilizing a therapeutic intervention to facilitate a scheduled execution. The process of improving a person's health in order to kill him feels like a cruel betrayal.
Creating moral ambiguity, however, is the fact that a refusal to provide needed medical care or food might itself raise serious questions of cruel and unusual punishment. There is betrayal, whichever way we turn.
Severing the link between treatment and execution
The solution to the dilemma may be to sever the link between treatment and death. States could classify mentally ill individuals as automatically ineligible for execution, regardless of how effective treatment might be. Alternatively, the Supreme Court could reconsider the requirement of competency for execution.
However we proceed, the link between medical treatment and execution sullies not only the doctors who participate in such treatment but also the prosecutors who fight to revive a man's sanity only to extinguish both the man and his sanity shortly thereafter.

Study: Night owls may benefit from evening strengthStory Highlights Sometimes night owls are mislabeled as having insomnia It's very difficult for a night owl to become a morning person The part of the brain called the hypothalamus contains the body's "clock" Even single-celled organisms do different tasks at different times of the day Next Article in Health » Read VIDEO By Elizabeth Landau CNN	(CNN) -- If you have a hard time crawling out of bed in the morning, it could be that your body is biologically programmed to start the day later. Some people who appear to have insomnia are biologically night owls, one expert says. Experts say a spectrum of natural sleeping and waking rhythms exists, ranging from extreme morning people to extreme "night owls." A new study examines how morning people compare with night owls on a strength test and looks at what other physiological processes may contribute to their performance. Researchers tested participants' leg muscle strength at various points in the day. They looked at nine "early birds" and nine "night owls," who were classified as such based on a questionnaire. Surprisingly, morning people's strength tends to remain constant throughout the day, but night owls have peak performance in the evening, said researchers from the University of Alberta in Canada. "We thought that morning people would be better at this in the morning, but they never changed," said study co-author Olle Lagerquist, a Ph.D. candidate in neurophysiology at the University of Alberta.

That may be because evening people show increased motor cortex and spinal cord excitability in the evening, about 9 p.m., meaning they had maximal central nervous system drive at that time, Lagerquist said. Morning people, on the other hand, never achieve this level of central nervous system drive because the excitability of the motor cortex does not coincide with the excitability of the spinal cord. In other words, these two measures never peak at the same time, he said. Early birds' brains were most excitable at 9 a.m. and slowly decreased throughout the day. Researchers don't know whether this means evening people who are athletes are necessarily better off. Although night owls may maximize their strength in the evening, they are at a serious disadvantage if they have to compete in the morning. Morning people, on the other hand, would have the same average performance regardless of the time of the competition, Lagerquist said. Based on the findings, Lagerquist recommends that people who struggle athletically in the morning try going to the gym at night, as they may feel more awake and perform better then, he said. The study reinforces findings that athletic performance varies over the course of the day, said Dr. William Schwartz, professor of neurology at the University of Massachusetts. Although the study is small -- 18 people participated -- it highlights problems with being a night owl that sleep experts often see in patients. American society favors morning people, because the typical work day begins in the morning and ends in the evening, said Dr. Nancy Collop, Medical Director of the Johns Hopkins Sleep Disorders Center. Her sleep center tends to have many more night owls seeking help than early risers, she said. Health Library

Fairly commonly, people come to the sleep clinic at Johns Hopkins having been mislabeled as insomniacs when they are just night owls, Collop said. "Their body clock is separate from what their work clock is supposed to be," Collop said. It's very difficult for a night owl to become a morning person, Collop said. At a sleep clinic such as the one at Johns Hopkins, people seeking to change their habits may be asked to sit in front of a very bright light early in the morning and to take melatonin to help them sleep earlier. Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate circadian rhythms, the daily rhythms that persist in the body within a period of about 24 hours. The tendency to do certain actions at particular times of the day is a phenomenon seen across the animal kingdom. Even single-celled organisms do different tasks at different times of the day, Collop said. More complex organisms also need a rest period built into the 24-hour cycle. In humans, light drives this cycle, she said. The part of the brain called the hypothalamus contains the human body's "clock," Schwartz said. There is evidence that biological rhythms are dictated by genes, although people can train themselves to some degree, he said. Teenage and young adult males have the highest risk for delayed sleep phase, or night-owl tendency, she said. But it's hard to know how much of that comes from genetics and how much comes from social pressures, she said.

Israel, Palestinians stake positions ahead of talksBy the CNN Wire Staff Benjamin Netanyahu says his goal is to "seriously and responsibly" advance a peace agreement with Palestinians. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Abbas says Israel will be held responsible, if talks failNetanyahu sees success if both sides take the talks seriouslyPalestinians want Israeli government to condemn a leader's sermonDirect peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority begin Thursday Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli and Palestinian leaders were looking forward to direct talks this week in Washington with both hope and apprehension. The two sides have agreed to hold direct peace talks beginning Thursday, the first such talks since 2008. "I am convinced that if the Palestinian leadership approaches these talks with the same degree of seriousness as [us], we will be able to advance toward a stable agreement that will ensure peace and security for both peoples and will contribute to the security and stability of the region," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. Netanyahu leaves for Washington on Tuesday, he said, with the goal to "seriously and responsibly" advance a peace agreement with the Palestinians. The talks will be held without prior conditions, he said. In a speech Sunday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he is traveling to Washington with the support of Arab governments. "We have crossed a long way to reach to these negotiations, and our Arab nations have supported us" through a committee of the Arab League that drew up the basis for launching the negotiations, Abbas said. The goal, Abbas said, was to reach a consensus that "would assure the national rights of our people and end the occupation from all occupied Arab land and provide security and freedom and real peace for all countries of the region and its nations, including our Palestinian people. " Specifically, he cited an end to the control of east Jerusalem by the Israelis as well as an end to construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. "We stress Israel's need and our need for security, but security cannot remain a pre-text to continue settlement activities and take over our land and deny our rights," Abbas said. He added that if the talks fail, the Israeli government will be "the only one to be blamed and held responsible." Netanyahu said he was aware of the difficulties that have derailed such talks in the past, and said that the basic question for him was whether the Palestinians are as willing to work toward peace as them. "There shouldn't just be a tactical halt between two wars or two outbreaks of terrorism, but a peace based on recognition, security, stability and economic prosperity between the two peoples that will endure for us and our children," Netanyahu said. He said any agreement would be based on principles, including the recognition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people, ending the conflict and establishing security agreements on the ground. Abbas, for his part, said Palestinians "hope that we will find in Israel a genuine partner that is capable of taking decisions and responsible measures in order to attend the occupation." The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erakat, struck a more apprehensive tone ahead of the talks, calling on the Israeli government to denounce what he called Israeli incitement and racism against the Palestinians. Erakat's call followed comments made by the spiritual leader of the Israeli Shas Party, Ovadia Yosef, during a weekly sermon. According to Erakat, Yosef said that Abbas and the Palestinians must "perish" from the world. "The spiritual leader of Shas is literally calling for a genocide against Palestinians and there seems to be no response from the Israeli government," Erakat said. "He is particularly calling for the assassination of President Abbas who within a few days will be sitting face to face with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Is this how the Israeli Government prepares its public for a peace agreement?" Shas is one of the main coalition members in Netanyahu's government. Erakat said that the Palestinians are ready to resume negotiations in "seriousness and good faith," but that Israeli insults do nothing to advance the peace process. In response, Netanyahu's office released a statement, saying, "These things do not reflect Prime Minister Netanyahu's approach nor that of the Israeli government."CNN's Guy Azriel and Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.

Can congressional Republicans repeal Obamacare?
By Alan Silverleib and Dana Bash, CNN
updated 9:22 AM EDT, Tue July 3, 2012
House Speaker John Boehner spoke with the media soon after the Supreme Court's ruling last Thursday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Republicans say they can use reconciliation to overturn large parts of Obamacare
Reconciliation lets a bare Senate majority change certain tax and spending rules
GOP leaders are also using the issue to fire up their conservative base
Chief Justice Roberts called the mandate a tax in last Thursday's ruling
Washington (CNN) -- While conservatives are still seething over last week's Supreme Court ruling saving President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, top Capitol Hill Republicans are gleefully using the decision to fire up their base with promises of a repeal in 2013.
The high court's 5-4 decision "underscores the urgency of repealing this harmful law in its entirety," House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said shortly after last Thursday's ruling. "Republicans stand ready to work with a president who will listen to the American people."
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, announced that his GOP-controlled chamber will vote on a full repeal on July 11. While the House is certain pass the measure -- it's already done so once before -- the largely symbolic bill has no chance of clearing the Democratic-run Senate.

Behind Justice Roberts' decision
But what if Mitt Romney is elected president in November while Republicans hold the House and win a majority in the Senate? Could that be enough to undo Obama's signature legislative accomplishment? Top GOP strategists believe they could essentially gut the law, thanks in part to the wording of Chief Justice John Roberts' controlling opinion.
Read the high court's Obamacare ruling
Roberts ruled that the controversial individual mandate -- the core part of the law forcing Americans to pay a fine if they don't have health insurance -- is actually a tax. And a complex congressional rule known as reconciliation would allow Republicans to change certain tax and spending components of the health care law with only a bare Senate majority.
"The chief justice said (the mandate) is a tax, and taxes are clearly what we call reconcilable," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said on Fox News Sunday. "That's the kind of measure that can be pursued with 51 votes in the Senate. And if I'm the leader of the majority next year, I commit to the American people that the repeal of 'Obamacare' will be job one."
The reconciliation process could also be used to strip funding for the statute, one senior GOP strategist told CNN.
Democrats used reconciliation in 2010 to pass a package of amendments to the health care law. Republicans blasted the move at the time, calling it an unreasonable manipulation of the legislative process.
Reconciliation matters because in today's sharply polarized political climate, most legislation can't clear the 100-member Senate without a filibuster-proof of majority of 60 votes. Right now, the Republicans control 47 Senate seats. While most political analysts believe the GOP has a decent shot at a net pickup of four seats this fall, almost nobody believes the Republicans can gain 13 seats.
In the meantime, top congressional Republicans have latched onto the notion that the individual mandate is a tax -- something GOP leaders believe plays into one of the Democrats' main political weaknesses.
Obamacare is "not a good idea (and) I think you saw one of the reasons why -- because it's a tax increase," Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a possible GOP vice presidential nominee, said Saturday. "It's a massive tax increase on the middle class."
While Democratic leaders still maintain the mandate is not a tax -- instead calling it a penalty -- roughly 60% of Americans believe it is, according to a CNN/ORC International poll released Monday. The poll also notes that while an overwhelming majority of GOP voters oppose the mandate, 55% of independents do as well.
Republican Senate candidates are now being told that "every day you are not talking about (the health care issue) is a day you've wasted," according to a Washington-based GOP strategist.
One potential wrinkle in any GOP plans to call the individual mandate a new Democratic tax: Romney's health care overhaul in Massachusetts also included a mandate.
"This was a plan that, that Gov. Romney supported," White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." "It's something that I would think that he would have been proud of."
Pressed on the issue Monday, Romney senior campaign adviser Eric Fehrnstrom told MSNBC that the presumptive GOP presidential nominee agrees "with the dissent written by Justice (Antonin) Scalia which very clearly stated that the mandate was not a tax."
Fehrnstrom bucks Republican line on 'Obamacare' as 'tax'
Asked repeatedly if Romney agrees with Obama and Democrats that the penalty tied to the mandate is not tax, Fehrnstrom eventually said, "That's correct."

UK High Court to rule on radical Muslim cleric's extradition to U.S.
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 9:14 PM EDT, Tue October 2, 2012
Radical cleric Abu Hamza gestures at the 'Rally for Islam' in central London in August 2002.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Abu Hamza al-Masri's lawyers are due to present their arguments Wednesday NEW: Lawyers for the police and Crown Prosecution Service will also give evidence
Lawyers say their clients' detention in U.S. prisons would violate their human rights
The latest hearing will determine if there is a compelling reason to halt extradition
London (CNN) -- Lawyers for radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri and four fellow suspects presented last-ditch arguments Tuesday against their extradition from Britain to the United States to face terrorism charges.
Al-Masri, whose followers included the so-called "shoe bomber" Richard Reid and who once called al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden a "hero," faces 11 charges in U.S. courts.
Extradition ruling marks end of era for radical cleric
The charges include conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping of 16 Westerners in Yemen, and conspiring with others to establish an Islamic jihad training camp in rural Oregon in 1999.
He faces a potential life sentence if convicted.
Accused UK terrorist extradited to U.S.
Last week, after almost a decade of legal battles, the European Human Rights Court ruled that the cleric and four other suspects could be sent to the United States. The men's lawyers appealed the ruling.
A two-judge panel at London's High Court must now decide whether the defendants' lawyers can show new and compelling reasons to stop the extradition.
Lawyers for Adel Abdul Bary and Khaled Al-Fawwaz argued Tuesday that if they are extradited to the United States, their detention in super-maximum security prisons would breach their human rights under European law.
The court was also told that new evidence from an al Qaeda informer weakened the case against Al-Fawwaz in relation to his alleged involvement in bomb attacks against U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998.
The informer, L'Houssaine Kherchtou, made no mention of Al-Fawwaz's name in an 800-page briefing document given to MI6, Britain's spy agency, the court heard. Kherchtou, a Moroccan, was an early member of al Qaeda who pleaded guilty in 2000 to his involvement in the East Africa bombings and gave evidence against co-defendants. In return, he entered a witness protection program.
Lawyers for the United States argued, however, that there was a strong case against both Bary and Al-Fawwaz. This included the presence of Bary's fingerprints on a claim of responsibility faxed before the bomb even went off, they said.
The other suspects facing extradition to the United States are Syed Thala Ahsan and Babar Ahmad.
Apart from al-Masri, none has been convicted of any offense.
The lawyer representing al-Masri is expected to present his arguments against extradition on Wednesday, one of them being his client's failing health.
The judge will also question lawyers from London's Metropolitan Police Service and Britain's government-run Crown Prosecution Service.
They are expected to face questions about why they passed key evidence straight to American authorities rather than pursuing prosecutions in the United Kingdom.
Born in Egypt in 1958, al-Masri traveled to Britain to study before gaining citizenship through marriage in the 1980s.
A one-time nightclub bouncer in London's Soho district, al-Masri -- also known as Mustafa Kamal Mustafa -- has said he lost both hands and one eye while fighting against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. He often wore a hook in place of one hand.
In 1997, al-Masri became the imam of a north London mosque, where his hate-filled speeches attacking the West began to attract national attention and followers, including Reid, the so-called "shoe bomber" who attempted to blow up a Miami-bound passenger airplane three months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Al-Masri has called the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center "a towering day in history" and described bin Laden as "a good guy and a hero."
He also described the Columbia space shuttle disaster in 2003 as "punishment from Allah" because the astronauts were Christian, Hindu and Jewish.
The cleric is one of the highest-profile radical Islamic figures in Britain, where he was already sentenced to seven years for inciting racial hatred at his north London mosque and other terrorism-related charges.
Last week's decision, which was signed by seven judges from different European nations, followed a ruling this spring in which the same court likewise said that Hamza and the four other terror suspects could be extradited.
The suspects would not get "ill treatment" in super-maximum security prisons if they are extradited to the United States and convicted in American courts, according to the European court's decision last Monday.
That ruling noted that conditions in such U.S. prisons are in some ways better for inmates than in Europe, given that they'd have access to television, newspapers, social visits and hobby-related items. It acknowledged the prisoners might be confined to their cells most of the time, but said this was warranted given the charges they face.

Readers respond as Aesha's surgery and life progresses
Join the conversation CNN iReport
By Jessica Ravitz, CNN
updated 4:49 PM EST, Thu December 20, 2012
Aesha Mohammadzai is transforming both physically and emotionally. Six months into multistage reconstructive surgery, she's on her way to having the nose she's wanted since she was disfigured and left for dead in Afghanistan. These photos were taken before her latest surgery in December 2012.
Her ears, which were also cut off by her Taliban husband and in-laws, will be reconstructed after her nose is completed.
Scars on her left arm show where doctors took tissue that was then transplanted onto her face. Her emotional scars are also healing, and she's learning to trust in new ways.
On Monday, she will undergo the next dramatic surgery in a process she's not ashamed to show off.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Aesha's face and story have captivated readers across the world
Readers speak of her beauty, her bravery and how she's inspired them
Her story offers uplifting message amid sadness of Connecticut shootings
(CNN) -- The evolving life, face and story of Aesha, disfigured by the Taliban and featured on the August 2010 cover of Time magazine, has captivated audiences around the world.
CNN has been following her for close to two years and, earlier this week, updated readers on how she is doing both physically and emotionally. We shared exclusive photographs of what she looked like before her latest surgery.
Monday's procedure, the fourth in a series to reconstruct her nose, lasted about 9½ hours and went smoothly, said Mati Arsala, who's become a father figure to Aesha Mohammadzai. Doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where she's being treated, will not discuss her case.
The reactions to the latest story about Aesha poured in -- both in the story's comments section and by way of e-mail -- even as the world's eyes remained trained on Friday's mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.
"This girl has more courage than all the fanatics that hurt her will ever have," wrote akmac61.
"Aesha you are a beautiful woman, wishing you the best! A whole new great life is ahead just for you, better things are coming," said tr0j4n.
"I am speechless, no words can express the depth of my feeling for this beautiful lady. I salute your courage in the face of illiteracy and extremism," added ProsNCons.
Some readers wrote with special offerings for Aesha and the family caring for her. An e-learning company in Canada wants to help with her education. The owner of a bed and breakfast in West Virginia would like to treat them to a weekend getaway. A woman in Texas encouraged Aesha to open a Web-store, perhaps on Etsy, to sell her jewelry. Many others wrote with promises of prayers and extensions of love .
In May, CNN published an exclusive story documenting Aesha's complicated journey.Edythe McNamee/CNN
As is so often the case when CNN mentions Afghanistan or simply the Muslim world, there were inevitably readers who took this opportunity to attack that faith. But more readers pushed back, perhaps hinting at decreased tolerance for such prejudices. There was also a fresh perspective brought on by the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut.
"I guess in the Taliban, everybody with a twisted opinion gets to play God," wrote onaturalia.
"and unfortunately some in the US," responded are122.
"Exactly, and they are not all Muslims," said Rollins.
Further down in the comments, Tina Mantooth added, "I agree 100%. Islam doesn't teach hate."
"Then why do Muslims do so many inhumane things?" asked swarm4.
"Was Adam Lanza a Muslim? No," answered Elhaba Wackadoodle. "Inhumane things are inherent in all humans. Some just act on them while the rest of us don't."
Some, who wrote to me directly, shared that the story about Aesha was a salve for the sadness that had befallen the country.
"It was especially nice to read after the horrors of Newtown," wrote one person.
"It did my soul some good to read such a hopeful story and to learn about the Arsalas' kindness and good will at a time like this, when everything seems pretty dark in the U.S.," wrote another.
"In a time filled with tragedy and sorrow, thank you for an uplifting and positive article," wrote a third.
A couple of readers seemed bent on offending Aesha, those who care for her and pretty much everyone else, by making comments directed at her looks -- as if she had any control over them.
But plenty of readers stood up for her, including lxNay, who wrote, "She will be beautiful again. The surgery will repair her mutilations, but nothing can repair the ugliness displayed by some posters here. Stupid can't be fixed."
Saving Aesha: Life after Taliban attack
Some readers wondered why the country would help her instead of others.
"Who is paying for the surgery? Don't you think there are enough disfugured (sic) citizens in this country who needs (sic) more attention?" asked Jayjay.
In response, iPostEyeAm wrote, "You misspelled 'I need a heart implant.'"
A handful of readers latched onto information in the story about how Jamila Rasouli-Arsala, Aesha's mother figure and a former OB-GYN in Germany, is struggling to find her way in America's medical community. If she wants to practice medicine here, she must start over in a residency program -- and so far she's had no luck getting into one. If she can't, the whole family, Aesha included, may end up moving to Germany.
"Concerning Jamila's plight, one has to ask what is going on in the U.S. concerning attracting and keeping good doctors," wrote bob. "From what I am hearing, the U.S. doesn't sound like a land of opportunity but instead a country representing endless bureaucratic roadblocks, dogma and special interests."
Answered FBreen: "Until there is an international standard for medical education and training, I am happy that such requirements exist."
There were lessons that readers from across the globe took away from the piece. A reader in Poland, who previously had not felt connected to Aesha's story, wrote, "It is the right thing to shout it to the world, to make clear there is no acceptance to barbarism and abuse."
Added a writer from Nigeria: "Am very happy the way you Americans are helping people all over the world."
And then there was this one, from a young woman who saw in Aesha's story something she knows too well.
"This is Anika from miles away, Bangladesh. I read your story on Aesha early this morning on the CNN website and it overwhelmed me with emotions I usually try to bury. I am 22 too like her and part of a society that may not bruise my body but wounds my soul and self confidence everyday. Stories like Aesha's inspire us, girls, struggling to live a normal and deserved life."
Whether she knows it or not, whether she means to or not, Aesha is making a difference.

Tiny flying robots! Meet the quadrotor
By Jeremy Bradley, CNN
updated 5:18 PM EDT, Wed May 1, 2013 | Filed under: Innovations
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
At Penn lab, researchers have created small aerial robots
The quadrotor takes commands but is programmed to decide how to do them
A YouTube video of quadrotors playing the James Bond theme reached millions
They were used in post-earthquake Japan to investigate damaged buildings
(CNN) -- It's a mesmerizing, surreal scene. Eight tiny, unmanned aerial vehicles -- called quadrotors -- begin to rise from the ground in unison.
They hover at eye level, filling the room with a heavy buzzing sound. Then they move through a makeshift window, one at a time, and reform as a group on the other side.
This isn't happening on a Spielberg set, and it isn't science fiction. These real-life flying robots are at the University of Pennsylvania's General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception Lab.
"This is a robot that's completely autonomous," said doctoral student Matthew Turpin, "and by that I mean there's no remote control in the background."
The lab is a mechanical engineer's dream. Quadrotors in all shapes, sizes and colors -- and in various degrees of assembly -- cover nearly every surface. Shelves line the walls, filled to the brim with tools and toys.
Most noticeable is the lab's state-of-the-art Vicon motion-capture system. Infrared cameras placed throughout a test-flying area communicate with tiny sensors on the quadrotors, feeding into a computer-based navigation system.
"We have the Vicon system, or the red lights, which allow us to figure out where the robot is," Turpin explained. "Then we're able to send it commands about what we'd like it to do and group behaviors that you'll see."
Turpin gives the quadrotors simple instructions via computer, but the vehicles decide how to get from Point A to Point B on their own. The results are a dazzling display of formations, from spinning in circles in midair to navigating obstacles in sync with each other.
Other quadrotors at the GRASP Lab have worked together to carry cargo and build structures.

"These robots are able to pick up these simple, almost LEGO-like bricks, and they're able to carry them from one location to another," Turpin said.
But perhaps the quadrotors' most memorable moment was when they played instruments to perform the James Bond theme song. The video has more than 3 million views on YouTube.
As much fun as Turpin and his colleagues seem to be having, he says their ultimate goal is to put quadrotors to good use outside the lab.
After the 2011 earthquake in Japan, a team from the University of Pennsylvania and Tohoku University in Sendai took quadrotors into the disaster zone. Led by Vijay Kumar, a former GRASP Lab director and professor at Penn, they achieved some remarkable accomplishments.
Among them: sending quadrotors -- equipped with cameras and lasers -- into an unstable building to see what sort of information they could gather.
"We went into a collapsed building; we mapped three floors," Kumar said. "We got three-dimensional maps, and we were able to show that this sort of thing is feasible today."
Quadrotors could also use sensors to detect radiation levels and other biological hazards, Kumar said. That could help keep first responders out of harm's way.
"Clearly, humans will always have a role to play in emergency response for law enforcement," Kumar said. "But if there's an emergency, if there's a 911 call, the question is, do you want a human dashing off to respond to it right away?"
Kumar also saw an opportunity for quadrotors to be used when law enforcement was close to apprehending a suspect in the Boston bombings.
"After the tragic incident in Boston, you saw that robot actually ripping away the canvas on top of the boat to try to look behind the cover" for the suspect, he said, "It's an excruciatingly, painfully slow operation. What we'd like to do is accomplish these tasks really quickly."
There are plenty of positive uses for quadrotors. But the concept of stealthy, camera-toting robots does cause concern for some people.
Kumar often fields questions about misuse of the technology and privacy concerns.
"I think we should engage in a public dialogue about when to use them, what the potential benefits are, and recognize that we can protect ourselves against abuse of these devices -- as opposed to saying 'we don't want to develop this,' " he said.
For now, most of the research on these robots is still done in the lab. But you could say their potential is sky high.
