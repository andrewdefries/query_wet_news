'Man vs. Wild' host injured in Antarctic expeditionStory Highlights Adventurer and TV show host Bear Grylls injured his shoulder Grylls was in Antarctica on an expedition for charity Host going to UK for treatment, Discovery Channel says Next Article in Entertainment » (CNN) -- Adventurer and TV show host Bear Grylls injured his shoulder in Antarctica during an expedition to raise money for an international charity, the Discovery Channel said Sunday. Bear Grylls, host of "Man vs. Wild," was injured in Antarctica during an expedition to raise money for charity. Grylls was injured Friday night after falling during the expedition, which was not for the Discovery Channel, according to the network's statement. The statement said that Grylls is returning to the UK to receive medical attention. "Once he sees a doctor, we will have a better sense of the level of seriousness of his shoulder injury and the recovery time needed to get him back to his full physical activity," according to the statement. Grylls, 34, is the host of Discovery's "Man vs. Wild" in which he demonstrates extreme measures -- including eating snakes and insects -- used to survive in harsh environmental conditions. In his blog, Grylls said the aim of his expedition in Antarctica -- sponsored by Ethanol Venture -- is "to promote alternative energies and their potential." Don't Miss Read Bear's blog

"We will be using lots of different forms of alternative power, including wind-powered kite-skiing, part bio-ethanol powered jetskis and inflatable boats, electric-powered paragliders, solar- and wind-powered base camps -- and good old foot work," Grylls wrote in a November 14 entry. Grylls is a former member of the British Special Forces and has broken his back in several places during his service. In his blog, he said he and his wife Shara are expecting their third child in January. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

A wild card awaiting Romney By David Gergen, CNN Senior Political Analyst
updated 11:19 PM EST, Fri January 13, 2012
Newt Gingrich's attacks on Mitt Romney may work better in South Carolina, David Gergen writes.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
David Gergen: Mitt Romney's primary and caucus victories are impressive
Gergen says there's one issue that could derail Romney -- his role at Bain Capital
Gingrich attack failed in New Hampshire, but South Carolina may be different, Gergen says
Gergen: Will huge block of ads by PAC against Romney dent his chances?
Editor's note: David Gergen is a senior political analyst for CNN and has been an adviser to four presidents. He is a professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Follow him on Twitter: @David_Gergen.
(CNN) -- If our politics weren't so fluid and volatile, one would think, now that the votes are tallied in New Hampshire, that the race for the Republican nomination is virtually over. But for better and worse, we are living in a new era.
By any standard, Mitt Romney has now achieved some impressive results:
-- He is the only GOP candidate other than Jerry Ford to win back-to-back victories in Iowa and New Hampshire (and of course Ford was a sitting president).
-- In a crowded field in New Hampshire, he shattered the 25% ceiling that was dogging his candidacy. His nearly 40% total of the vote beat John McCain's victory total four years ago.
-- He delivered a speech after his New Hampshire victory that was carefully crafted for prime time and was his best of the year -- far better than his forgettable performance after Iowa. The campaign has also started to draw more upon the warmth and vibrance of Ann Romney, a substantial asset for her husband.
-- And he has also managed to execute a divide-and-conquer strategy well enough that no single rival has emerged who can unite the anti-Romney forces.
David Gergen
So, by the normal rules of politics, Romney holds a commanding position heading into the next primary on the docket, coming up in South Carolina on January 21. Someone has to beat him there or it's game over.
But -- and this may be a significant but -- there is a new wild card in play: a PAC supporting Newt Gingrich allegedly has enough money and enough buys to pour in $3.5 million worth of negative advertising against Romney in the next 10 days. As their blood feud heats up, the Gingrich forces clearly hope to destroy Romney as effectively as they believe the Romney PAC destroyed Gingrich with a barrage of negative advertising in Iowa.
Can a huge block of ads in a small media market, trashing Romney as a predatory buyout tycoon, do to Romney what the candidates haven't been able to do on their own -- bring him down?
Democrats have all along believed that they can make the charge stick, just as Ted Kennedy did when Romney challenged him for the Senate in 1994. They have already started to track down disgruntled former employees, and their files are presumably bulging with new stories.
Meanwhile, Republican rivals like Gingrich and Rick Perry (who has taken to calling Romney a "vulture capitalist") may think they have knocked Romney back on his heels with their assaults heading into the New Hampshire vote. Romney was rattled on the stump, making a couple of gaffes and telling small fibs that may haunt him down the road. (And Gingrich is starting to go after Romney on social issues such as abortion.) So, with South Carolina as make-or-break, the men behind Gingrich have drawn their daggers.
But there is an old and time-tested adage: When you strike a king, you must kill him. It is not at all clear that Romney's rivals have that capacity, and there is a growing possibility that Romney could not only block them, but could thrust a sword into them in return.
For starters, the assaults against Romney had no visible impact on his vote in New Hampshire. Sure, they came late enough in the game that most voters didn't have a full grasp -- but even so, they bounced off. And while South Carolina has a lousy unemployment problem with a lot of jobs shipped overseas, it is also a business-friendly state, especially in the Greenville-Spartanburg area in the northwest, where international companies have built plants along the "I-85 autobahn." South Carolinians are pretty sophisticated about "gales of creative destruction." And Romney -- unlike Gingrich in Iowa -- has money to spend on ads countering the attacks, which is important for creating a shield against the daggers.
Also, a backlash against Gingrich and Perry has sprung up among conservative economists, who reject the premise behind the attacks and are outraged that Republicans who have pledged fealty to free-market principles are now trying to sabotage a successful entrepreneur for political gain. Leave that to the Obama Democrats, they seethe.
Finally, Romney showed evidence Tuesday night in his acceptance address that he is more than willing to fight back -- indeed, he showed that he wants to flip the argument against them so that he emerges as the candidate who is the champion of the free market against those who would cripple its vitality.
My own sense is that, absent more damning evidence, Romney can seize the high ground in this fight, certainly among GOP primary voters. His leadership at Bain Capital has always been a central premise of his campaign, and it has worked reasonably well, because Bain Capital has a positive reputation in Boston and beyond. I have worked with today's Bain partners on several projects, mostly revolving around nonprofits, and I have found them to be highly professional, socially committed individuals. Some are seen as among the leading philanthropists in New England.
It is worth remembering, too, that the Olympics hired Romney to head the Games while he was at Bain Capital. Is it logical to think the Olympic committee had any sense that Romney was a predatory capitalist? The question answers itself.
In short, attacks on Romney's business experience at Bain have become a wild card in the South Carolina race. Perhaps they will inflict serious damage and reshape the race. But it seems more likely that Romney will blunt the attacks and, in conservative eyes, turn himself into a more admired champion of free markets who has a better chance of uniting the party behind him. If he handles the issue with skill, he could even blunt the Democratic assaults that are surely coming.

Sunken treasure finally arrives in Spain
By Al Goodman, CNN
updated 12:04 PM EST, Sat February 25, 2012
The treasure will be turned over to Spain's paramilitary Civil Guard for safekeeping.
Spain says its navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was carrying the coins.
The coins came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony.
The treasure includes fabled "pieces of eight," some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials say.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A treasure estimated worth half a billion dollars arrived in Spain
The coins had been the object of a legal battle in the United States
The company that found the treasure lost its claim in the courts
Madrid (CNN) -- A treasure worth an estimated half billion dollars in gold and silver coins, recovered from a Spanish warship that sunk two centuries ago, arrived in Madrid Saturday, just weeks after U.S. courts ruled that Spain had rights to the loot, not the Florida deep-sea salvage company which found it on the ocean floor.
Two Spanish military cargo planes, which retrieved the nearly 594,000 coins in crates from a secretive warehouse in Florida, landed at the Torrejon military air base in Madrid just before 2 p.m. (8 a.m. ET).
The two planes arrived at a U.S. military base in Florida earlier this week -- on the heels of a team of Spanish government experts who did an inventory of the treasure -- and departed on Friday for the overnight flight to Madrid.
That was after the Florida company, Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. had exhausted its legal appeals all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined without comment Odyssey's motion for a hearing earlier this month.
"Spain has now been victorious at every level in the United States courts, from Tampa to Atlanta to Washington," said Jim Goold, who defended Spain's claim to the treasure. "I am pleased and proud for all of us."
Odyssey Marine Exploration made an emergency appeal to the high court in an attempt to block a lower court's order that it turn over the treasure to Spain.
The dispute goes back to 2007, when Odyssey announced it had found a 19th-century sunken ship off of Spain. The company claimed ownership of the coins and said it had flown them to a guarded location in the United States.
Spain filed suit in a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure.
Spain says its navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was carrying the coins. The 34-gun frigate left Peru in 1804 and crossed the Atlantic to within a day's sail from Spain when British ships attacked the Spanish fleet.
In the ensuing Battle of Cape St. Mary, south of Portugal, the Mercedes was hit in its powder magazine and exploded, according to the Spanish government's filing to the Florida court.
In 2009, the federal court in Tampa ruled in favor of Spain and the federal appeals court in Atlanta upheld the ruling last September. Last January 31, the appeals court denied an Odyssey motion, which Odyssey appealed to the Supreme Court.
Spain's Culture Minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, told CNN in Madrid earlier this month that the case was never really about the money.
"We're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition, but this is something that enriches our material, artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such," Wert said in an interview.
He said the coins would be exhibited at Spanish museums, and perhaps elsewhere.
Peru, too, has followed the fate of the coins, which came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony.
"Formally, they haven't claimed anything, but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the Latin American museums," Wert said.
The treasure includes fabled "pieces of eight," some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials have said.
The treasure, which already has crossed the Atlantic Ocean twice, by ship in 1804 and then by plane in 2007, has now arrived on the Spanish mainland for the first time.
A Spanish Defense Ministry official at the Torrejon base said the treasure will be turned over to Spain's paramilitary Civil Guard for safekeeping.
The Culture Ministry is expected to hold a news conference and possibly show off a portion of the coins in the coming days.

Mars can wait. Oceans can't
By Amitai Etzioni, Special to CNN
updated 3:55 PM EDT, Fri August 17, 2012
James Cameron's recent journey to the deepest point in the ocean deserves more attention, says Amitai Etzioni.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Many voices have suggested U.S. should reinvigorate its space program
Amitai Etzioni says there are more pressing priorities on earth than in space
Manned missions are much less cost effective than robotic exploration, he says
Etzioni: Exploring the ocean, much of which is uncharted, is an urgent priority
Editor's note: Amitai Etzioni is professor of international relations and director of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies at George Washington University.
Washington (CNN) -- While space travel still gets a lot of attention, not enough attention has been accorded to a major new expedition to the deepest point in the ocean, some 7 miles deep -- the recent journey by James Cameron, on behalf of National Geographic.
The cover story of the prestigious journal Foreign Affairs lays out the "Case for Space." "60 Minutes" recently ran a story about the dire effects on Florida's space industry of scaling back our extraterrestrial endeavors. Newt Gingrich gained attention earlier this year by calling for building a permanent base on the moon. And President Obama has talked of preparing to eventually send Americans into orbit around Mars.
Actually, there are very good reasons to stop spending billions of dollars on manned space missions, to explore space in ways that are safer and much less costly, and to grant much higher priority to other scientific and engineering mega-projects, the oceans in particular.
Amitai Etzioni
The main costs of space exploration arise from the fact that we are set on sending humans, rather than robots. The reasons such efforts drive up the costs include: A human needs a return ticket, while a robot can go one way. Space vehicles for humans must be made safe, while we can risk a bunch of robots without losing sleep. Robots are much easier to feed, experience little trouble when subject to prolonged weightlessness, and are much easier to shield from radiation. And they can do most tasks humans can.
British astronomer royal Martin Rees writes, "I think that the practical case (for manned flights) gets weaker and weaker with every advance in robotics and miniaturization. It's hard to see any particular reason or purpose in going back to the moon or indeed sending people into space at all." Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg calls manned missions "an incredible waste of money" and argues that "for the cost of putting a few people on a very limited set of locations on Mars we could have dozens of unmanned, robotic missions roving all over Mars."
The main argument for using humans is a public relations one. As Neil deGrasse Tyson puts it in Foreign Affairs, "China's latest space proclamations could conceivably produce another 'Sputnik moment' for the United States, spurring the country into action after a relatively fallow period in its space efforts." Also, astronauts are said to inspire our youth to become scientists and explorers. However, it is far from established that we cannot achieve the same effects by making other R&D projects our main priority.
Take the oceans, about which we know much less than the dark side of the moon. Ninety percent of the ocean floor has not even been charted, and while we have been to the moon, the technology to explore the ocean's floors is still being developed. For example, a permanent partially-submerged sea exploration station, called the SeaOrbiter, is currently in development.
The oceans play a major role in controlling our climate. But we have not learned yet how to use them to cool us off rather than contribute to our overheating. Ocean organisms are said to hold the promise of cures for an array of diseases. An examination of the unique eyes of skate (ray fish) led to advances in combating blindness, the horseshoe crab was crucial in developing a test for bacterial contamination, and sea urchins helped in the development of test-tube fertilization.
The toadfish's ability to regenerate its central nervous system is of much interest to neuroscientists. A recent Japanese study concluded that the drug eribulin, which was derived from sea sponges, is effective in combating breast, colon, and urinary cancer.
Given the looming crisis of water scarcity, we badly need more efficient and less costly methods to desalinate ocean water. By 2025, 1.8 billion people are expected to suffer from severe water scarcity, with that number jumping to 3.9 billion by 2050—well over a third of the entire global population.
If the oceans do not make your heart go pitter-patter, how about engineering a bacteria that eats carbon dioxide -- and thus helps protect the world from overheating -- AND excretes fuel which will allow us to drive our cars and machines, without oil? I cannot find any evidence that people young or old, Americans or citizens of other nations, would be less impressed or less inspired with such a breakthrough than with one more set of photos of a far away galaxy or a whole Milky Way full of stars.
Space enthusiasts claim that space exploration has generated major spinoffs for our life right here on Earth. Tyson quotes President Obama suggesting that the Apollo mission "produced technologies that have improved kidney dialysis and water purification systems; sensors to test for hazardous gases; energy-saving building materials; and fire-resistant fabrics used by firefighters and soldiers," and adds a few more innovations to the list: "digital imaging, implantable pacemakers, collision-avoidance systems on aircraft, precision LASIK eye surgery, and global positioning satellites."
Of course, the space environment is radically different from the one on Earth. Materials and technologies that are suited for a vacuum, zero gravity, and extreme cold and heat are not the ones we typically can use on Earth.
Opinion: Gingrich's moon colony lost in the laughter
Elias Carayannis, professor of Science, Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship at The George Washington University, notes "government agencies -- particularly those such as the National Space and Aeronautics Administration that are continually pressured to justify their activities -- tout the spin-off value of their investments in sometimes quite extravagant claims." Products such as Velcro, Tang, and Teflon that are often cited as spinoffs of space technology did not actually result from the space program.
Space promoters tell us, once every few months, that there are signs that there might be or has been water on one of the planets that might make "life" possible. I wonder if some of those who hear these reports interpret them to mean that we expect to find a civilization out there, one that we could ally with, say against the Chinese. What scientists are really talking about is organic material, the kind found in any compost -- not a reason to spend billions of dollars of public funds.
In short, do not cry for Mars. It is not going away. We can send R2D2 to explore it and still keep a whole pile of dough for important and inspiring exploration missions right here on Earth, starting at the beach nearest you.

Will evidence come up at Friday's bond hearing for Zimmerman?
By Phil Gast, Vivian Kuo and Jessica Thill, CNN
updated 8:41 AM EDT, Fri April 20, 2012
George Zimmerman's bond request will be heard Friday in Florida.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Meeting aimed at community healing held in Sanford
Martin family declines to meet with George Zimmerman
Bond hearing for Zimmerman is set for Friday in central Florida
Judge will consider several factors, including flight risk, danger to community
(CNN) -- George Zimmerman went into hiding amid a national uproar over the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. That seclusion ended last week when the Sanford, Florida, neighborhood watch volunteer turned himself in after being charged with second-degree murder.
On Friday morning, Zimmerman will seek bond -- and freedom -- despite ongoing concerns about his safety.
"There have been a lot of emotions that have come forward in this case, and some of those emotions have shown themselves in bad ways," defense lawyer Mark O'Mara said this week about his client's well-being.
The bond request will be heard by the case's new judge, Kenneth Lester Jr.
Special prosecutor Angela Corey has the burden of showing why bond should not be set or that it should be high. The burden is referred to as "proof of guilt is evident or presumption of guilt is great." Corey would have to convince Lester that a jury would convict Zimmerman.

Finding a fair judge in Zimmerman case
The parties could agree to a bond that must be approved by the judge. If that does not occur, Lester would conduct a hearing Friday morning, and evidence, including sealed information the public has not heard before, might be produced.
In that scenario, Corey could call witnesses and submit paperwork, such as affidavits and police reports.
Among other factors, Lester will examine the seriousness of the crime, Zimmerman's ties to the community, his conduct and whether he poses a danger or flight risk. Zimmerman claims he is indigent.
The defense is expected to argue Zimmerman is not a flight risk or danger to the community.
In 2005, Zimmerman was arrested in an assault on an officer and resisting arrest after an incident in a local bar. Zimmerman explained that the case was born out of mistaken identity. He entered a six-month, pretrial diversion program as part of a plea deal, court documents show.
Although his previous legal counsel indicated Zimmerman fled Florida because of security concerns, the defendant remained in touch with authorities when they needed to reach him, according to Sanford police.
Zimmerman surrendered April 11 to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
O'Mara on Thursday brought clothing to Seminole County's John E. Polk Correctional Facility for his client to wear Friday.
"He's very worried about the whole process, but I think we have built up a trust relationship, which is great," O'Mara told CNN Orlando affiliate WESH. "I think he is hopeful he will be out on bond tomorrow. He certainly wants to be back with his family."
The attorney previously told reporters he has taken no fees from Zimmerman, saying his client is not in a family of means. "I think he's indigent for costs. He doesn't have any money."
O'Mara filed a motion that asks the court to allow Zimmerman's family members to provide testimony at the bond hearing by telephone. The state attorney's office did not object.
Natalie Jackson, an attorney for Martin's family, on Thursday told CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin that O'Mara called to set up a private meeting between Zimmerman and the Martin family. The family declined, Jackson said, indicating they want Zimmerman, instead, to give a deposition on what happened the evening of February 26.

Martin case called 'peak of an iceberg'
Martin's family believes Zimmerman, 28, racially profiled their 17-year-old son, who was walking back from a convenience store, and unjustly killed him after disregarding a police dispatcher's request not to follow the unarmed teen.
Zimmerman contends he acted in self-defense. His family says he did not profile Martin.
According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman told authorities that after he briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchange words, Zimmerman said, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk.
Sanford, the city where the shooting took place, held a community healing meeting Thursday evening.
The city offered a nine-point working plan to improve strained relations between the city, police and the black community.
The proposal includes a community relations commission, a blue-ribbon panel to represent community concerns, a diverse interfaith alliance and an anti-violence campaign.
Vanessa Baden of the student group Dream Defenders said the city has ignored the black community's complaints about the Sanford Police Department for years.
"What does the city plan to do with Chief (Bill) Lee?" asked Baden. Lee temporarily stepped down following anger over the department's decision not to charge Zimmerman. The case against Zimmerman was brought by Corey.
For some Sanford residents, the Martin case has become a rallying cry, a chance to air what they believe are years of grievances and cases of injustice between the police, the courts and the black community. For others, it has forced them to defend their town as a place that is not inherently racist, a place where a young black man cannot be killed without consequence.
Florida authorities, meanwhile, have picked 17 people to tackle a heated question brought on by the killing of Martin: whether the state's "stand your ground law" should be changed.
The task force, whose membership was announced Thursday, will hear impassioned arguments and testimony from residents at public meetings across the state.
"We're not walking into this with any preconceived notions," Republican Gov. Rick Scott said at a news conference. If there are "logical changes to be made," he said, the task force "will provide those."
It will pass along recommendations to the governor and the legislature.
The group will review Florida Statute Chapter 776, which deals with justifiable use of force, including the "stand your ground" provision.
The law allows people to use deadly force when they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury. Critics and defenders of the law have argued over just what it allows, when it applies, and whether it achieves its intended effect.
CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.

'Change is imminent': African CEOs look to bright future

Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- Sitting at the first Africa CEO Forum this week, in the heart of Geneva, I asked myself if this was the right time to open the debate on Africa's private sector future. Was Geneva the right place? Critics will rightly argue that this sort of event should have been held in Africa.
Over two intensive days, top African chief executive officers shared with attendees from all over the Africa, Europe and Asia, some latest trends and best practices, discussed the future of the continent's private sector, and received awards and accolades.
Speakers such as the outspoken Sudanese-born billionaire Mo Ibrahim tried to boost the narratives of Africa's position compared to China and India but with little solutions to offer. When I asked him why the event was not held in Accra or Johannesburg, Ibrahim replied by stating that the reasons were more infrastructural and logistical than anything else.
Marieme Jamme
Paul Collier (Oxford University), Makhtar Diop (World Bank's Vice President for Africa), and Donald Kaberuka (chairman of the African Development Bank) also sent some very strong messages to African CEOs by reminding them to promote Africa's private sector.
Diop said: "This CEO Forum reminds us that Africa needs its business leaders as never before -- to help it generate more electricity, grow more food, and create more jobs to keep growing strongly, while also improving people's well-being through less poverty, better health and education, and more hope."

Despite the positive kick-off, the conference saw the presence of few women CEOs and panelists, which demonstrated the need to push African women into the board room. However, women like Rwandan Valentine Rugwabiza (WTO) and Wendy Luhabe from the Women Private Equity Fund, made their voices strongly heard. Lubabe stressed the need for challenging and removing bad leaders in politics and in our organizations.
"We must not allow nepotism and tribalism to exist in our organizations," she said. "We must create a culture of performance not mediocrity."
She added: "It is our responsibility as Africans to build a better business environment and create talent for our people."
Luhabe emphasized the importance of educating the youth, as they are the future of Africa, and of creating entrepreneurs and adding vocational training to employment policies and agendas.
A recurring theme at the event was that Africa needs more champions -- the likes of Bob Collymore, CEO of Safaricom in Kenya, Thierry Tanoh, CEO of Ecobank and Tewolde Gebremariam, CEO of Ethiopian Airlines. The last two were respectively named African Company of the Year and African CEO of the Year at the Forum.
...African CEOs need a platform where they can share and learn from one anotherMariéme Jamme
This event was extremely timely, current and relevant. Timely, because Africa's growth has been consistent in the past decade -- almost 6% growth per year. The global crisis in Europe is not stopping Africa's growth.
Read related: Marieme Jamme: Shaping Africa's tech revolution
Current, because the narratives about Africa need to change; we are witnessing great progress in the continent and this needs to be highlighted. Relevant, because African CEOs need a platform where they can share and learn from one another.
Most of the African CEOs have never met before but share common problems. However, only time will tell what impact the event will have on the CEOs when they return home. Africa faces enormous problems. A conference in Geneva can only ever be one step towards solving them.
Good governance and transparency are still a challenge in Africa. African CEOs need to implement good procurement systems to fight corruption and leaks. They must create a culture of performance and challenge mediocrity at its core.
The forum was packed with journalists from all around the world including young African bloggers and journalists from France's biggest newsrooms. The question we are all asking ourselves now is how can we create, maintain and retain talent in Africa?
The continent is needed more than ever, [the CEOs] said, but I think African CEOs must start working together...Mariéme Jamme
As the Apps4africa 2012 competition team travels to find the next tech CEO in Africa, all these questions were left unanswered at the African CEO Forum. The forum failed to talk about the youth of Africa, the Diaspora, technology hubs, and the growth of micro-economic dynamism we are seeing today.
It dramatically failed to address what development strategies African companies should employ to sustain and scale up their businesses.
Twitter: 10 African tech voices to follow on Twitter
CEOs did not fail by any means to demonstrate that Africa is changing and growing despite all the negatives press.
Their energy and enthusiasm were palpable. The continent is needed more than ever, they said, but I think African CEOs must start working together, trusting each other, thinking of implementing a regional integration package and finding a route for transferring solutions between African countries.
They must have a common platform where they can continue to learn from each other and share ideas. This is currently lacking.
Collaboration is imperative amongst the CEOs of Africa. After all, the only way their individual successes is to be measured and defined is how people's lives have changed, how many jobs are created, how many people get access to information, and how much their human resources have progressed.
Let's be honest -- Africa still faces great challenges. Investors are still reluctant to invest -- there are huge barriers. Starting a business is not always straight forward in may countries in Africa, the business ecosystem is almost non existent in many countries, we still have electricity issues, getting funding to start a business is still challenging in most parts of Africa, people aren't trained enough to execute essentials jobs, degrees gained by most African are useless or have no purpose in the job markets.
These entire impediments must be addressed. Change is imminent!
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mariéme Jamme.

Giant 'seagull' set to land on Istanbul skyline
By Lauren Said-Moorhouse and Matthew Knight, CNN
updated 6:08 AM EST, Wed November 28, 2012
The planned new transport hub is designed to look like a flying seagull when viewed from the waters of the Bosphorus, as illustrated here by this CGI by creators, Hakan Kiran Architecture. In addition to its iconic design, the building will incorporate green features including rainwater collection and a renewable energy facility. The building will house a new metro link, a tram station, an underpass for vehicles and ferry docks. When it opens, the new transport hub will facilitate the transfer of 90,000 travelers daily. This drawing gives a birds-eye view of the proposed building. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A new seagull-shaped transport hub is to built on the banks of the Bosphorus The new transport center will provide links for ferries, trains, buses and small ships, say developers Project will incorporate green features like rainwater collection and renewable energy Construction due to start next year with station scheduled to open in 2015/16
The Gateway goes behind the scenes of the world's major transport hubs, revealing the logistics that keep goods and people moving. This month, the show is in Istanbul, Turkey. (CNN) -- Wheeling around the skies above the ferry boats and cargo ships, seagulls are as a familiar sight above the Bosphorus as the commuters and containers on it.
Their enduring presence on Istanbul's busy waterway will soon be further cemented with the construction of a new transport hub designed to look like the seabird in flight.
Perched on the western shores of the Bosphorus, the Kabatas Seagull Transportation Hub will enable new and improved connections for ferries, trains, buses and some small ships, says Ali Ulvi Altan, director of major projects for Hakan Kiran Architecture.

Infographic: Historic hub where east meets west "Today this area carries around 60,000 passengers per day ... when [the hub is completed it will carry] around 90,000 persons per day by our estimates," Altan said.
The seagull was a natural choice for the design, says Altan, because the bird is the symbol of the Bosphorus.
The Istanbul-based architects will be assisted by Dutch engineering company, Royal HaskoningDHV who will be providing geotechnical, environmental and maritime expertise.
In addition to its iconic design, the project will incorporate green features such as rainwater collection and a renewable energy facility.
Work on the building is due to start next year, Altan says, and should be completed by 2015/16.

Justin Bieber dethrones Lady Gaga on Twitter
By Brandon Griggs, CNN
updated 10:35 AM EST, Tue January 22, 2013 | Filed under: Social Media
On Monday night, Lady Gaga was surpassed by Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Justin Bieber surpasses Lady Gaga to become the most followed person on Twitter
As of Tuesday morning Bieber had about 33,333,000 followers to Gaga's 33,329,000
But Gaga still has more "Likes" on Facebook
(CNN) -- In a perfect world, our most popular Twitterer might be a brilliant scientist, writer, philosopher or spiritual leader.
In this world, he is an 18-year-old pop star with famous hair.
On Monday night, Justin Bieber surpassed fellow singer Lady Gaga to become the most-followed person on Twitter. As of Tuesday morning, The Biebs had more than 33,333,000 followers, while Gaga was closing in on 33,329,000. Both numbers continued to creep up, but it appeared Bieber was gradually increasing his lead.
Neither had immediately acknowledged the milestone on Twitter. Gaga's latest tweet was a message to fans about her concert Monday night in Hollywood, California, while Bieber's was a plug for a recent Teen Vogue photo shoot.
Based on their respective rates of growth, Bieber and his hordes of Beliebers were projected to overtake Gaga on Sunday afternoon, according to Twitter Counter, but Gaga's Little Monsters put up a fight.
The coiffed Canadian crooner is Twitter's first new king or queen since Gaga dethroned Britney Spears in August 2010. But Gaga still has more fans on Facebook -- almost 55 million, compared to Bieber's 50,666,000. (Rihanna tops both with 65 million.)
Twitter's top 10 users (seven of them are singers):
1. Justin Bieber -- 33.333 million
2. Lady Gaga -- 33.329 million
3. Katy Perry -- 31.4 million
4. Rihanna -- 27.9 million
5. Barack Obama -- 26.1 million
6. Britney Spears -- 23.3 million
7. Taylor Swift -- 23.1 million
8. YouTube -- 22.2 million
9. Shakira -- 19.3 million
10. Kim Kardashian -- 17.2 million

Oscar Pistorius leaves jail after bail granted
By Diane McCarthy and Michael Pearson, CNN
updated 2:17 PM EST, Mon February 25, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Oscar Pistorius leaves jail after posting bond
Family is relieved, uncle says
Pistorius is accused of killing his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp
Magistrate cites "errors and concessions" from chief investigator during testimony
Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius left jail Friday, free on bond eight days after the shooting death of his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Magistrate Desmond Nair said the state had problems with its investigation and had not offered enough proof to keep Pistorius jailed.
"I come to the conclusion that the accused has made a case to be released on bail," Nair said, eliciting a celebratory cry of "Yes!" from the courtroom.
"We are relieved," said Pistorius' uncle, Arnold, speaking on behalf of the family.
Pistorius, who wept throughout much of Friday's hearing, remained quiet and reserved after the announcement and did not appear to celebrate. His family hugged quietly.
Tweets from @cnni/oscar-pistorius
"As a family, we know Oscar's version of what happened that tragic night. And we know that that is the truth and that will prevail in the coming court cases," his uncle said.
Pistorius is accused of premeditated murder in the February 14 shooting death of Steenkamp, 29.
Prosecutors say Pistorius, 26, killed her after a heated argument in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day.
The sprinter says he thought an intruder was hiding in a toilet room inside the bathroom of his Pretoria home. He says he fired in a fit of terror before realizing Steenkamp was inside.
"I'd like to ask Oscar why he didn't lean over and touch my cousin first...and say 'are you okay?' 'keep quiet,' 'I'm coming now,'" said Kim Martin, Steenkamp's cousin.
In full: Pistorius' affidavit to court
While recounting a litany of "improbabilities" in Pistorius' account, Nair said defense attorneys had done enough to prove the "exceptional circumstances" required by South African law for the release of a suspect charged with premeditated murder.
He said the former chief investigator in the case, Hilton Botha, had made "several errors and concessions" in his testimony at the bail hearing, and said prosecutors had failed to prove that Pistorius was a flight risk or had a propensity toward violence.
Botha was replaced after prosecutors reinstated attempted murder charges against him in a 2011 incident unrelated to Pistorius.
Key arguments
During the four-day bail hearing, prosecutors argued that Pistorius had a history of violence and that his account didn't add up.
Prosecutors relied heavily on Botha's testimony, including statements from witnesses, who said they heard Pistorius and Steenkamp arguing before the shooting, as well as ballistic evidence that Botha said proved Pistorius was lying about how he had shot into the door.
But Botha seemed to buckle under questioning from defense attorney Barry Roux, who got the detective to acknowledge that the bullet evidence wasn't as conclusive as he had initially said and that at least one witness he had spoken to could not say for certain that the sounds he had heard came from Pistorius' house.
Nair also said that Botha had failed to exhaustively check cell phone records and chided the investigator for failing to check with Interpol before testifying that Pistorius owned a home in Italy -- raising his profile as a potential flight risk.
Will Pistorius be released on bail?
Judge, not jury, decides Pistorius case
Take a virtual look at Pistorius' defense
The source of the information about the house apparently was a magazine article, the judge noted.
Roux also said that defense investigators had found a bullet missed by police and that police may have contaminated the crime scene by failing to wear protective shoe covers. Police had run out of the covers, Botha testified.
Nair said he wasn't convinced by prosecution arguments that Pistorius had a violent nature and was a threat to the public. The prosecution cited an incident in which Pistorius reportedly fired a gun on accident inside a Johannesburg restaurant and another in which he allegedly made violent threats.
Finally, Nair said Botha had "blundered" in testifying that a substance recovered from Pistorius' home was testosterone. Some outsiders to the case have speculated that steroids or other substances could have played a role in the killing.
The defense lawyer told Nair the substance was a legal herbal remedy. Tests are ongoing, authorities said.
Too soon to judge
On the other hand, Nair said Pistorius' account is full of "improbabilities," from why he did not know Steenkamp had gotten out of bed to why he would have charged toward the bathroom door -- where he believed he had an intruder cornered -- if he was as scared for his life as he claimed.
Nair warned that it is too soon to judge the state's case, and he noted that a wide range of experts beyond Botha had worked on the initial phases of the investigation -- from ballistics experts to specialists in blood spatter.
"The pieces of the puzzle may not yet all be before me," he said.
Conditions of bail
Pistorius left jail in a Land Rover chased by paparazzi on motorcycles Friday afternoon after posting a cash bond of 100,000 Rand (about $11,200). Another 900,000 Rand (about $100,800) is due by March 1, Nair said. He headed to his uncle's home after his release.
He cannot return to the home where the shooting happened, has to give up his passport and can't go near an airport, Nair ruled. He also can't drink alcohol and must report to authorities four times a month.

Investigator's removal
The decision comes a day after the South African Police Service moved to remove Botha from the case.
Botha, a 22-year detective, is accused of seven counts of attempted murder after allegedly chasing and firing on a minibus full of people while drunk, according to officials.
A spokeswoman for South Africa's prosecution service said the accusations would be little more than a "speed bump" in the case.
Friend reacts
Model Vanessa Haywood, a South African model who is friends with Pistorius, said the murder charge doesn't fit with the kind-spirited man she knows. And she said she can relate to Pistorius' story of being filled with terror at the thought of an intruder.
"It's not the safest place in the world," she said of crime-ridden South Africa, where murder and carjacking cases are common. "My own home is like a prison. His version of events isn't as far-fetched as people think it is."
'Blade Runner'
Pistorius earned the nickname "Blade Runner" as he competed on special carbon fiber blades in place of more traditional prosthetic limbs. He was born missing bones in his lower legs, and doctors amputated his legs below the knees when he was 11 months old.
Pistorius attained fame as a symbol of triumph over adversity when won a challenge to compete in the London Olympics. While he failed to medal there, he smashed a record to win the men's 400-meter race in the Paralympic Games a few weeks later.
He is considered a national hero in South Africa.
Pistorius put his career on hold after his arrest, and sponsors Nike and Oakley suspended their contracts with him.

His coach said Friday before the bail decision that, should he be let out on bail, the runner would resume training.

Heart attacks: What you should know
By Dr. John P. Reilly, Special to CNN
updated 7:26 AM EDT, Wed April 10, 2013
Symptoms of a heart attack may not always resemble those seen on TV, an expert says.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Immediate medical attention is crucial if you are having a heart attack
Symptoms of a heart attack may differ in women
After a heart attack, it's important to reflect upon your lifestyle
Editor's note: Dr. John P. Reilly is editor-in-chief of secondscount.org, the patient education website of the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, which is focused on raising awareness of heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases. Reilly is the program director for the Cardiology Fellowship Program at Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans.
(CNN) -- If you are one of the nearly 785,000 Americans who suffer a first heart attack this year, what you do in the first few minutes can determine an entire lifetime.
Unfortunately, many people do not know what symptoms to look for or what life-saving steps to take. To help make sense of it all, the following can help you or someone you know survive a heart attack:
Q: What are the top three things I should know about heart attacks?
A: When a heart attack strikes, seconds count.
Dr. John P. Reilly
Seek medical attention immediately. The longer your symptoms persist, the greater the amount of heart muscle damage you may suffer. The start of your symptoms is a signal that blood flow to your heart muscle has been blocked. The emergency department and interventional cardiologist or surgeon will move quickly to restore blood flow to your heart to prevent further damage.
Call 911 for an ambulance. Don't drive yourself or have someone else drive you. During a heart attack, your heart rhythm can become abnormal or even stop.
Dr. Gupta: Heart attack-proof your life
Rosie O'Donnell suffers a heart attack
Emergency medical providers can perform an electrocardiogram, or EKG, on the way to the hospital and confirm whether you are having a heart attack and treat your heart rhythm abnormalities if needed. They can also call the hospital in advance to prepare a medical team for your arrival so treatment can start immediately.
If available, chew one uncoated aspirin while waiting for the ambulance. This may help slow the formation of blood clots that can cause heart attacks.
Q: What are the common symptoms of heart attacks, and how do they differ between men and women?
A: We've all seen the scenario where the actor grabs his or her chest in agonizing pain and falls to the ground. A heart attack seems obvious, but in real life, it's not always that clear.
Heart attack symptoms can vary and don't always involve debilitating chest pain. Many patients say their symptoms were not painful but more like an ache or discomfort. Symptoms may start with a dull pain in the chest or disguise themselves as indigestion, nausea, shortness of breath or heartburn. Other common symptoms include arm, neck, jaw, back or upper stomach discomfort, dizziness, change in heart rhythm and sudden cold sweats.
But these symptoms may differ for your wife, mother or sister because women do not always experience the same heart attack symptoms as men. Symptoms may be subtle and difficult to identify and may not even include chest pain.
While this does not mean women cannot have chest pain, other symptoms that may signal a heart attack for women include sudden weakness and fatigue, body aches or flu-like symptoms. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women, so it's important that you don't ignore these symptoms, regardless of how subtle they are.
Q: What are my heart attack treatment options?
A: There are various treatment options available when you're having a heart attack. The most effective treatment is angioplasty and stenting. In some cases, clot-busting medication is administered intravenously. In rare and severe cases, emergency coronary artery bypass grafting is needed.
Angioplasty is a minimally invasive, nonsurgical procedure that opens the blocked artery. During the procedure, a small mesh tube called a stent may be placed in the artery to restore blood flow and scaffold the vessel open.
Clot-busting medications melt away the blood clot that is blocking the artery. Coronary artery bypass grafting is open-heart surgery where a healthy artery or vein from elsewhere in the body is connected upstream and downstream from the heart artery blockage, bypassing the blockage and creating a new path for blood flow.
Fortunately, medical technology has advanced tremendously in recent years, and many patients can return home and back to their normal -- if not better -- quality of life within days of treatment.
Q: What should I do following my heart attack?
A: Experiencing a heart attack is a life-changing event and an important time to reflect upon your current lifestyle.
Cardiac rehabilitation benefits many patients by helping them resume a healthy lifestyle following their heart attack. You'll also be taking medication regularly. Adhering to your medical therapy and scheduling consistent follow-up visits with your cardiologist and primary care doctor are both beneficial habits to adopt.
In addition, it's important to become your heart's No. 1 health advocate. Assess your current lifestyle and see where you can make improvements. Can you eat healthier and exercise more, reduce your stress levels or quit smoking? These changes will greatly increase your odds of fighting off future heart attacks.

Here's to Collins -- and the NBA
By Roxanne Jones, Special to CNN
updated 6:06 AM EDT, Wed May 1, 2013
Jason Collins, who played with the NBA's Washington Wizards this season, has disclosed that he is gay, making him the first active openly homosexual athlete in the four major American pro team sports. Collins (No. 33) played college ball for Stanford, here against Maryland in 1998. He has been in the NBA for 12 seasons. With the New Jersey Nets, Collins guards the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal in 2002 in Los Angeles. Collins played for the Nets from 2002 through 2008.
Collins and his twin brother, Jarron, pose for a portrait during the 2004 NBA All-Star Weekend. Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic steals the ball from the Nets' Collins in 2005 in Orlando, Florida.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Roxanne Jones: Kudos to NBA player Jason Collins for coming out publicly Jones: NBA head David Stern worked for decades to create an inclusive environment Jones: Because of Stern, it was "no big deal" when WNBA's Brittney Griner came out Only question that matters for Collins, she says, is whether he can step up his game
Editor's note: Roxanne Jones is a founding editor of ESPN The Magazine and a former vice president at ESPN. She is a national lecturer on sports, entertainment and women's topics and a recipient of the 2010 Woman of the Year award from Women in Sports and Events. She is the co-author of "Say It Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete," (Random House) and CEO of Push Media Strategies. (CNN) -- Thank you, Jason Collins, for stepping up and being a real man. I like your game.
A real man is honest and confident and can look the world in the eye and take responsibility for his own life. Real men can stand up to religious zealots who believe that they have the right to stand in judgment of others. You are exactly the right man at the right time to help break down the stereotypes about gays in professional sports.
And kudos to the NBA Commissioner David Stern for working tirelessly over decades to create a workplace environment that is inclusive and diverse across many cultural issues, including sexual orientation.
Roxanne Jones
"Jason has been a widely respected player and teammate throughout his career, and we are proud he has assumed the leadership mantle on this very important issue," the commissioner said Monday.
Having worked in sports for two decades and having been a straight ally for most of my adult life, I know this day didn't come just because President Barack Obama and other politicians say it's OK to be gay. Sure, having the topic of LGBT equality in the public conversation is an important part of changing a culture, but it has been the everyday people with the courage to advocate for equality and break down hostile environments that make a day like Monday possible.
The NBA, more than any other professional men's sports league, has worked to create a culture that supports gay athletes. No doubt, there will be critics and ugly accusations thrown at Collins. And that, along with his anemic stats -- 1.1 points per game -- might make it a challenge for him to find a job in the NBA next season. But the reaction from his peers to his coming out has been overwhelmingly positive:
NBA star Al Horford, an ex-teammate of Collins, tweeted: Al Horford‏@Al_Horford15h. @jasoncollins34 was a complete professional and a great teammate. I support him in his decision and wish him all the best in the future.
Collins and challenging gay stereotypes
Obama: 'Very proud' of Jason Collins
Barkley: Jason Collins will open debate
Another from All-Star Steve Nash of the LA Lakers summed up most of the comments around the league: Steve Nash‏@SteveNash21h The time has come. Maximum respect. RT @Baron_Davis: I am so proud of my bro @jasoncollins34 for being real. ... http://tmi.me/TGSBh
Under Stern's leadership, which began when he was named commissioner in 1984, NBA has been in the forefront of the discussion on gay rights in pro sports. And this was not always a comfortable or popular position.
Back when the Women's National Basketball Association launched in 1996, I was a young assistant sports editor working at the New York Daily News. Part of my job was to launch the first pull-out section announcing the formation of the league and a preview of all the teams.
It was nearly impossible to assign a WNBA story to any of the top sports writers. I recall the only writer who agreed to cover the league was Filip Bondy, to whom I will always be grateful. Everyone else loudly refused. "It's not even a sport," they told me. "I won't cover a bunch of @#&%! lesbians," the guys said.
But if not for the steely determination of Stern to see his league treated fairly by the media, or as fair as he could demand, few would have covered the WNBA at all back in its inception. Stern met with editors and producers from across the country and made it clear that the WNBA was a part of the NBA.
And if the media wanted to get credentials for the men's games, the women's games would be covered, as well, by the NBA writers. And he tried, as much as possible, to end the witch-hunters who spent time trying to track down which WNBA players were gay and who was dating whom on the teams.
That early culture-changing work is why it was "no big deal" as some writers said recently when Brittney Griner, the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft and one of the best female basketball players, came out of the closet, before she even played her first pro basketball game for the Phoenix Mercury.
Griner said when she was drafted: "If I can show that I'm out and I'm fine and everything's OK, then hopefully the younger generation will definitely feel the same way."
It took years for some WNBA execs, players and coaches to stop hiding their gay athletes and welcome the diversity that makes the game appeal strongly to all audiences. Eventually, the witch hunts mostly stopped and the game became based on its merits: It's either good, entertaining basketball, or it's not.
In April 2011, there were signs that Stern was continuing to look for ways to present the men's game as more gay-friendly. In a bold move, the league partnered with the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network and taped a serious of athlete public service announcements.
"Using gay to mean dumb or stupid: not cool. Not cool. Not in my house, not anywhere. It's not creative. It's offensive to gay people. And you're better than that," Grant Hill, who was playing for the Phoenix Suns, said in his announcement.
The Phoenix Suns' CEO Rick Welts, who has since resigned for personal reasons, had just come out in public, revealing that he was gay. (Welts is now president and chief operating officer for the Golden State Warriors.) Unfortunately, on the same day that Hill was taping his public service announcement, Laker star Kobe Bryant was caught on camera shouting a gay slur at a referee. Stern immediately fined him $100,000 and made Bryant apologize publicly.
But today is a new day. All eyes are on Collins. Hill is a superstar. Griner is a superstar in the making. Collins has been to the playoffs, but he's never been a star player. And he has work to do to prove he's still got NBA game.
The first question he has to answer is: Can you still ball?

How will the Supreme Court decide the Culture Wars? By John Avlon, CNN Contributor
updated 12:31 PM EDT, Sat June 22, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Jeffrey Toobin joins "Big Three" to discuss the week ahead for the Supreme Court Dean Obeidallah, John Avlon, Margaret Hoover weigh in on how the justices will rule
Expect rulings on gay rights and marriage, the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action
Editor's note: John Avlon, a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast, is the author of "Independent Nation" and "Wingnuts." He won the National Society of Newspaper Columnists' award for best online column in 2012.
(CNN) -- This week on the "Big Three" prodcast we talked with our special guest, CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, about the momentous upcoming week for the Supreme Court.
With 11 decisions left and just one week in the month of June to complete their rulings, the Supreme Court has held the most anticipated cases until the bitter end. Among these are rulings on gay rights, same sex marriage, the Voting Rights Act and affirmative action. This is the moment where the Supreme Court weighs in on the Culture Wars. Intense debate and some inevitable outrage seem sure to follow.
Toobin, author of "The Nine and the Oath" as well as a writer for The New Yorker, points out that Chief Justice John Roberts seems focused on building a more colorblind society as a core part of his court legacy. That means decisions regarding affirmative action and the special status of southern states in the Voting Rights Act could move in directions that would upset liberals and African-Americans in particular.
But Toobin cautions against buying into knee-jerk characterizations and politicizations of complex decisions. In particular, he points out that the Voting Rights Act will not be repealed or fundamentally gutted if conservative justices carry the day in the case brought by Shelby County, Alabama, arguing essentially that the requirements relevant to the 1960s desegregation no long apply.
On the court's return to the question of affirmative action, one Roberts quote from 2007 looms large over the decision: "The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."
John Avlon, Margaret Hoover and Dean Obeidallah Perhaps the preeminent civil rights fight of our time is the gay rights movement, and two cases on this front promise to capture the most attention. The first is regarding the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, passed by Congress in the 1990s. The second concerns the constitutionality of California's Proposition 8, which banned same sex marriages at the ballot box. Many close court observers believe that DOMA will be repealed while Prop 8 might be punted on standing.
This means that Dean's hope for a broad Loving v. Virginia type decision -- which outlawed state laws banning interracial marriage in the late 1960s -- might be thwarted for the time being. Margaret has been actively following this court case from its inception in California, where legendary conservative jurist Ted OIson banded with legendary liberal lawyer David Boies to argue that marriage is a basic civil right for all Americans.
This kind of bipartisan partnership based on deep principles rather than politics is a model for how to end the Culture Wars, whatever the results of this specific Supreme Court decision.
Whatever your personal politics, listen to Toobin jam with us on the "Big Three" as a curtain-raiser for the pivotal week ahead. These cases will affect all Americans, and by listening to this podcast you'll get up to speed, ready to debate the issues and analyze the landmark decisions delivered by the highest court in the land.

Typhoon Soulik soaks Taiwan, hits mainland China
By Ben Brumfield, CNN
updated 11:22 AM EDT, Mon July 15, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Upwards of 305,000 people have been evacuated along China's southeast coast
NEW: Typhoon Soulik made landfall in China on Saturday
NEW: More than 140 flights have been canceled at Changel International Airport
Read a version of this story in Arabic.
(CNN) -- Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated Saturday along China's southeastern coast as Typhoon Soulik struck, where the storm was expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain.
Upwards of 305,000 people left their homes in eastern China's Fujian province, according to state-run China Daily, citing the provincial flood control headquarters.
Soulik made landfall Saturday afternoon, bringing it with winds that reached a top speed of 118 kilometers per hour (73 mph), according to forecasters.
More than 140 flights have been canceled since Friday at Changel International Airport in the provincial capital of Fuzhou, and high-speed train services have also been suspended, authorities said.
Soulik also lashed Taiwan on Saturday, where it dumped up to 8 inches of rain on the capital city of Taipei and up to 14 inches in the island's mountain region in a single day, CNN meteorologist Samantha Mohr said.
This week in south-central China, downpours triggered flooding and landslides that killed dozens and wiped out thousands of homes. More than 100 are still missing, according to Sichuan province officials.
The typhoon's path should spare the region, according to the China Meteorological Administration.
But it will drop rain on areas in the east and north already soaked.
More than 5,000 Chinese soldiers have been deployed in the province in advance of the storm to help with possible rescues, China Daily reported.

House impeachment vote remains closeSome key members of Congress are shifting against Clinton
WASHINGTON (AllPolitics, December 15) -- As the House of Representatives heads toward Thursday's debate on impeachment, the outcome remains too close to call. But public pressure is building on remaining undecided members, and President Bill Clinton needs the support of an estimated eight to 10 Republicans to avoid a Senate trial.
The latest member to announce what he intends to do is Rep. Tom Campbell, a California Republican, who said Tuesday he intends to vote to impeach Clinton because he believes the president lied to a federal grand jury in the Monica Lewinsky affair. Clinton has admitted a relationship with Lewinsky, but denied he committed perjury or obstruction trying to conceal it.
"The matter is serious, it is grave, but it is not complicated," said Campbell. Rep. Tom Campbell
Campbell said he could give Clinton the benefit of the doubt if he
had been surprised by Paula Jones' attorneys in that case, but felt that Clinton was prepared to face Independent Counsel Ken Starr's grand jury with his attorneys by his side and chose to lie to them.
Another GOP moderate, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, said Tuesday he also would vote to impeach the president.
"After a careful review of the facts, I believe there is enough evidence to send this matter on to the Senate for a formal trial and their final consideration. I will vote for impeachment," Upton said.
The latest tally shows about 30 House members who have not declared what they intend to do when the House votes Thursday or, if the debate goes longer than expected, Friday.
In addition to Campbell and Upton, Rep. Anne Northup (R-Kentucky) held a news conference Tuesday to announce she too would vote to remove Clinton. Another moderate, Rep. Jack Quinn of New York, said he would vote for two impeachment articles charging Clinton with perjury. Rep. John McHugh (R-New York), scheduled a news conference in which he, too, was expected to announce he would vote to remove Clinton.
Rep. Anne Northup
If the House votes to approve any of the four proposed articles of
impeachment against Clinton, the impeachment case will move to the Senate for trial. For lawmakers who remain undecided, the pressure is on -- both internal pressure they place on themselves and from constituents who are telephoning and e-mailing them.
"This will be one of the toughest weeks I've had in my life and in my political life, absolutely," said Rep. Bob Ney, an Ohio Republican. "This is a very, very difficult week."
In a setback for the White House, anti-impeachment Republican Chris Shays, once firmly opposed to impeachment, indicated he is less sure now. The White House says the president will meet with Shays on Wednesday.
"I want to know if he understands that he broke the law," Shays said. "I want to know if he's willing to acknowledge to the American people that he broke the law, and I want to know that he acknowledges that he, like all Americans, has to be held accountable to the laws."
Rep. Christopher Shays
But the news for Clinton wasn't all bad. Virgil Goode, Jr., a conservative Democrat from Virginia who had suggested he would vote for impeachment, now says he is undecided. Democrats think Goode can be convinced to vote against all four articles of impeachment. Democrats are now hopeful that no more than three or four Democrats will vote for impeachment. Meanwhile, People for the American Way, a liberal interest group, is targeting some remaining undecided members with radio ads.
"You know, I can't believe this," a woman in the radio ad says. "They're going to vote to impeach the president this week. A man responds, "Come on! I mean, how many times do we have to tell Congress to move on?"
Some undecided lawmakers told CNN they will not announce their decision until they actually vote. That means it may be impossible to say whether the president will be impeached until the votes are counted.
At California Republican Brian Bilbray's office in San Diego, thousands of people are calling trying to influence his decision. Some of his constituents want him to make up his mind now.
But Bilbray has questions of his own for those who would criticize him.
"Have they read the president's testimony?" Bilbray asked. "Have they scrutinized it personally or did they just hear about it through hearsay? Bilbray says he wants to see all of the evidence before making a decision, a decision he says will be the third most important he has ever made.
"The first (was) being married," Bilbray said. "Probably the second was one that I didn't like, and that was having to decide to turn off life- support systems on my child. This one would fall third in my personal life."
Bilbray says he will not vote along party lines. He says he wants to know the facts and then decide.
"In the 22 years of being an elected official, this will probably be what my children and grandchildren remember me by," he said.
Still another California Republican, Rep. Frank Riggs, told CNN's "Early Edition" he is concerned that a majority of Americans appear to believe Clinton lied under oath, but do not want him kicked out of office.
"I'm very clear that my paramount responsibility under the circumstances is to first protect and defend the constitution, but also to uphold the rule of law," Riggs said. "But I'm wrestling not just with my conscience, but this apparent contradiction or paradox between the fact that a substantial majority of the American people apparently believes that the president lied under oath, but a similar majority do not want him impeached and removed from office."
CNN's Bob Franken, Jonathan Karl and Greg LaMotte contributed to this report. MORE STORIES:
