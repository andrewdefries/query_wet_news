Poll: Terrorism, Iraq very important to midterm voters
Adjust font size:
(CNN) -- Terrorism and the Iraq war will play very important roles in the votes of a large majority of Americans when they go to the polls for the November midterm election, a new CNN poll shows.On terrorism, 49 percent of the 1,009 respondents to the survey conducted by Opinion Research Corp. said it would be extremely important in deciding their congressional choices in November. Thirty-three percent said terrorism was very important, and 14 percent said it was moderately important.On Iraq, the numbers were statistically identical to the terrorism results, with 46 percent saying the issue was extremely important, 36 percent very important and 14 percent moderately important. (Read the complete poll data -- PDF)Taken together, terrorism and Iraq were at least moderately important to 96 percent of respondents.The Iraq war was opposed by 59 percent of those responding and favored by 40 percent. The numbers from the September 22-24 survey were statistically unchanged from a poll conducted in early August.The margin of error on the Iraq and terror questions was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. The margin for the other questions was plus or minus 3 percentage points.The last day of the recent survey coincided with reports on leaks from a classified U.S. intelligence document that says the Iraq war has increased the threat of terrorism. (Full story) (Watch how parties spar on report leaks -- 2:12)Asked which party in Congress would better handle specific issues, respondents backed Republicans on terrorism (47 percent to 41 percent), while Democrats were again seen as better able to handle the economy (51-39), health care (57-32), immigration (44-40) and moral issues such as same-sex marriage and stem cell research (47-40).By a margin of 47 percent to 42 percent, Democrats were seen as the party better able to handle the situation in Iraq -- another figure that is virtually unchanged since August.Among the 573 likely voters responding, 55 percent said they would vote for a Democrat if the election were held now, while 42 percent said they would vote for a Republican.The poll also showed President Bush's approval rating is holding steady, virtually unchanged since the start of August.Forty-two percent of the adults questioned approve of how the president is handling his job, while 55 percent disapprove.In early August, a CNN poll showed an approval rating for the president of 40 percent.

Stop TARP before more damage is doneBy John Thune, Special to CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSSen. John Thune says Troubled Asset Relief Program being used unwiselyGovernment racked up staggering deficit of $1.4 trillion over past fiscal year, he writesSenators asked Treasury chief to allow TARP to expire in DecemberThune says lawmakers will introduce legislation to put halt to spending
RELATED TOPICS
John Thune
Troubled Assets Relief Program
U.S. Department of the Treasury
Editor's note: Sen. John Thune, a Republican, represents South Dakota. (CNN) -- For the federal government, this has been the year of spending dangerously. The danger lies not just in the staggering volume of money being thrown around by the administration and Democrat-controlled Congress. It lies as well in their choices about how that money is being used and their apparent lack of concern that their spending splurge is unsustainable. Just this past fiscal year alone, which ended in October, the federal government has racked up a staggering deficit of $1.4 trillion, tripling the previous record. And it has done so in part through moves like buying an ownership stake in hundreds of banks, an insurance company, two automakers and numerous other businesses. A little over a year ago, Congress created the Troubled Asset Relief Program to try to stabilize plummeting financial markets. But in the name of solving one problem, the Treasury Department created another by getting the government dangerously entangled in the ownership and management of what had been privately run companies and industries. TARP is not the only problem, but it rests at the intersection where excessive government spending meets risky decisions. The government has used its position to dictate how much executives of those companies will be paid, and there is a risk that it will influence what products will and won't be produced. This kind of arbitrary involvement is perilous in a free-market economy, and it raises serious red flags about the potential for greater abuse. That's been the unintended consequence of the TARP legislation. It was designed as a focused response to an emergency. But that original purpose was turned on its head as the funds have been treated as ready cash to finance pet projects far beyond the intended scope of TARP. Not even counting the billions used to bail out General Motors and Chrysler, we've seen proposals to send some of the money to local governments that made investments that went bad and to help pay for highway projects. All of that cash comes in the form of debt that Democrats will pass on to our children to pay for a political agenda today. In response to this situation, in September I wrote, along with 39 of my Senate colleagues, to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner to urge that he allow the TARP program to expire on December 31 of this year. Since sending that letter two months ago, we have not heard anything from the administration in response. So with the end of the year fast approaching, several of my colleagues and I are introducing legislation to compel the Treasury Department to do what we had asked them to do voluntarily: put a halt to TARP spending. This would help put the brakes on the government's unprecedented spending spree and take away the temptation to get further involved in buying up private companies. It would also be a vital first step in untangling the government from the marketplace and all of the conflicts of interest that government creates by declaring who wins and who loses. That kind of government control over private business is not what made our nation great, and it will not help us restore America's economy today. As things stand today under TARP, the Treasury Department has the authority to spend just over $300 billion more on projects of its choosing. Our bill would take away that authority and protect taxpayer money from being wasted. It's clear that ending this one program will not, by itself, undo all of the damage, but it's an important first step. When I talk with my constituents in South Dakota, they do not mince words in expressing their anger and their concern about the amount of control the federal government has been exerting and the amount of debt it is running up in the process. Calling off TARP is one concrete thing we can do to reassure the American people that we understand their concern, we share it, and we are ready to do something about it. It is time to shut down the government slush fund that TARP has become. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Thune.

Arson attacks disrupt German rail traffic
By Rick Noack, CNN
updated 1:56 PM EDT, Wed October 12, 2011
A policeman carries a bag after searching for evidence at a place where flammable devices were found. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Germany's railway operator is offering a reward for information in the case
No one has been hurt in the explosions, police say
A previously unknown group claims responsibility
The group is opposed to Germany's presence in Afghanistan
Berlin (CNN) -- At least seven homemade explosives have been found along Berlin's railways within the last three days, police said Wednesday, severely disrupting traffic on several lines.
Two of the devices have exploded -- one Monday and one on Wednesday, authorities said, but nobody was killed or injured in the blasts.
Monday's explosion occurred next to a railway link between Hamburg and Berlin. The damage has not yet been repaired, authorities said.
Since Monday, at least 2,000 trains have been delayed due to the attacks, a spokesman for Deutsche Bahn told CNN Wednesday.
Another arson attempt -- this one on Berlin´s central train station -- failed Monday because officials discovered the device before it exploded.
"The German national rail company Deutsche Bahn has become the victim of extremists. Nevertheless, our controls have been successful," said Gerd Neubeck, senior manager of the company´s security department, in a written statement Tuesday.
Deutsche Bahn is offering a 100,000 euro (U.S. $138,120) reward for information leading to the arrests of those behind the blasts, according to a statement from the company.
A group called the "Hekla Welcome Committee-Initiative for More Social Eruptions" has claimed responsibility for the explosions.
"This morning we slowed down the German capital and its function as a global player in the export of armaments," said a statement from the group released Monday on a leftist website.
However, the group said it is not acting "with the intention to endanger somebody's life."
The group blames Germany´s involvement in the Afghan war for the attacks.
"German soldiers kill in different parts of the world. For 10 years, the German armed forces are at war in Afghanistan -- without the agreement of the German people," Hekla said.
At the beginning of October, a poll by the opinion research institute YouGov showed that two-thirds of all Germans do not believe in a successful military operation in Afghanistan anymore.
The alleged attackers also demanded the release of U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning from jail and criticized U.S. military actions all over the world. Manning is accused of leaking thousands of classified U.S. military and State Department documents to the WikiLeaks website.
The incendiary devices found in the past few days were filled with fluid and usually placed on cables, officials said. An investigation by the regional German police agency Landeskriminalamt is under way.
"I have ordered an immediate increase in police patrols around Berlin," German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said in a statement Wednesday.
Sources from Germany's Office for the Protection of the Constitution told CNN Wednesday that the Hekla Welcome Committee was previously unknown to authorities. The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. One source said German railways are a common target of leftist extremists. In May, a homemade explosive device hidden next to an important railway hub in the city's east caused massive delays.
In the 1970s, the leftist Red Army Faction terrorized Germany through bank robberies, kidnappings and assassinations. Its members were accused in more than 30 deaths.

Boston bombing suspect tweeted 'stay safe'
By Jason Kessler and Josh Levs, CNN updated 5:55 PM EDT, Fri April 19, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: A cryptic tweet last August refers to the Boston Marathon
2 friends of suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev tell CNN this is his Twitter account
Hours after the bombing, he tweeted "stay safe"
He tweeted that a photo of an alleged Boston bombing victim was fake
(CNN) -- Boston bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev has tweeted since the Boston Marathon bombings on what two friends of his tell CNN is his Twitter account.
His tweets included one at 1:43 a.m. Wednesday that said, "I'm a stress free kind of guy."
On Monday at 8:04 p.m. -- hours after the bombings -- he tweeted a quote from rapper Jay-Z and a 1970s R&B song, "Ain't no love in the heart of the city." The tweet added, "stay safe people."
Shortly after midnight, on Tuesday morning, he tweeted, "There are people that know the truth but stay silent & there are people that speak the truth but we don't hear them cuz they're the minority."
Friend: Suspect justified terrorism
Uncle calls bombing suspects 'losers'
Social media during a disaster
Tsarnaev uses the handle "J_tsar" and does not describe himself in the profile, which reads only, "Salam aleikum," a greeting among Muslims. The profile photo is the face of a lion with its mouth open, baring its fangs.
He has tweeted a dozen times since the bombing.
The most recent tweet is one he retweeted on Wednesday from Mufti Ismail Menk, who identifies himself as a Muslim scholar. "Attitude can take away your beauty no matter how good looking you are or it could enhance your beauty, making you adorable," the tweet reads.
Another tweet from Tsarnaev on Tuesday was a quote from rapper Eminem: "Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say but nothin comes out when they move their lips; just a bunch of gibberish."
After another Twitter account posted a photo Tuesday saying it showed a man who was going to propose to his girlfriend at the marathon in Boston and found her dead, Tsarnaev tweeted a two-word response: "fake story."
Another of the suspect's tweets, an apparent response to someone else's tweet, reads, " and they what 'god hates dead people?' Or victims of tragedies? Lol those people are cooked."
Also Tuesday, Tsarnaev tweeted, "So then I says to him, I says, relax bro my beard is not loaded." On Friday, another Twitter user retweeted that message, and added the words, "But my backpack is."
Other items that he wrote, well before the Boston bombings, on the social media site may offer more details pertinent to the investigation.
On August 10, 2012, for instance, Tsarnaev wrote -- in response to another user -- "Boston marathon isn't a good place to smoke tho." The context of this conservation, however, was not known.
