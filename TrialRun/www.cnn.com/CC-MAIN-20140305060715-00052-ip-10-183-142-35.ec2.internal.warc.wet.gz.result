Better understanding of dementia leading to more effective therapies Last week, I answered a question about the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Today I want to talk a little about how dementia is treated. Conditions Expert
Dr. Otis Brawley
Chief Medical Officer,
American Cancer Society	Understanding dementia Just a decade ago when a diagnosis of dementia was given, very little could be done for most patients except for treating behavioral disturbances and changing the environment to support safety and functioning. Better understanding of the biology of these illnesses has led to some treatments that can improve cognition. For most, the current treatments are far from satisfying, but they do give us hope that better drugs can be developed. The dementia should evaluated and diagnosed by a physician with special training in cognitive disorders. This may be a neurologist, a psychiatrist or, in certain instances, an internist or geriatric physician with specialized training. A precise diagnosis is important for effective management. There are several types of dementia other than Alzheimer's disease. Drugs used in the treatment of one type of dementia can actually worsen other forms of dementia. Haloperidol (Haldol) is indicated in the treatment of behavior issues in a patient with Alzheimer's disease, but can be harmful to a patient with dementia caused by Parkinson's disease. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter in the brain, meaning it is a chemical used to send messages from nerve to nerve. Researchers have found that patients with Alzheimer's disease and several other types of dementia have lower levels of this acetylcholine. Drugs that stop the action of cholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, are useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These "cholinesterase inhibitors" include tacrine (Cognex), donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne, formerly called Reminyl). They are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in several types of dementia and widely available internationally. These drugs come in pill and liquid form. Some are even available as a skin patch for transdermal application. A cholinesterase inhibitor should usually be started in early dementia and, if possible, be continued throughout the disease. In clinical study, they appear to slow the progression of the dementia in some patients. These drugs have significant side effects, such as slowing of the heart, gastric upset, nausea and vomiting, as well as difficulty urinating. Memantine (Namenda) is another oral medication. It is widely available for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's. It blocks stimulation of a specific receptor in the brain, an NMDA receptor. When stimulated, these receptors cause a cascade of events that lead to dementia. Memantine is also especially useful in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is a disease caused by decreased blood flow and oxygenation to parts of the brain. In a 28-week study of Alzheimer's patients, 250 were in a randomized trial to memantine or placebo. Compared with the group taking placebo, memantine-treated patients had less deterioration in mental function over the 28 weeks. This drug appears to provide a small but significant benefit in terms of cognition. Unfortunately there was no effect on behavior or ability to perform activities of daily living. Scientific study has proved this drug generally useful for six months, but the long-term benefit is unknown. Memantine has fewer side effects than the cholinesterase inhibitors. Dizziness is the most common side effect associated with memantine. A very small number of patients have auditory and visual hallucinations because of the drug. It also may to increase agitation and delusional behaviors in a small number of patients. Memantine should be started in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's. It is often used in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Since it may be disease-modifying, many physicians suggest it be continued even when there is no clinical improvement. Much attention has been given to Alzheimer's disease. Less is known about the treatment of other common dementias. In general, cholinesterase inhibitors have shown some benefit for patients with vascular dementia, those with mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, patients with the disease known as "dementia with Lewy bodies," and dementia from Parkinson's disease. These drugs are useful in certain variants of frontotemporal dementia. Cholinesterase inhibitors are not useful in dementia caused by Huntington's disease or traumatic brain injury. While cholinesterase inhibitors are useful in many early dementias, studies have not shown that treatment of patients with mild cognitive impairment, which is the condition before dementia, prevents or slows progression to dementia. Studies of treatment with estrogen, ginkgo biloba, vitamin E and vitamin B supplementation have been done. These drugs do not appear helpful. Some antidepressants have been shown to be effective in treating mood disorders associated with dementia, but they do not improve cognitive function. Several studies have demonstrated that dementia patients given structured exercise programs and occupational therapy have a less severe decline in activities of daily living and improved quality of life. These benefits have been observed over periods of years. Previous question:Does eating gluten cause eczema?« Back to Conditions

Paul Ryan: the Dr. Kevorkian of Medicare By Paul Begala, CNN Contributor STORY HIGHLIGHTSRepublicans have long opposed Medicare, Paul Begala saysHe says Rep. Paul Ryan's proposal would essentially kill the health system for seniors Begala says the plan is an attack on the vulnerable in societyHe says Congress should confront the rich and privileged, not those with few resourcesEditor's note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He is an affiliated professor at Georgetown University's Public Policy Institute. Washington (CNN) -- Republicans have always hated Medicare, but most Americans have always loved it. Now, led by Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republicans are trying to kill it once and for all. When JFK and LBJ proposed and passed it, Ronald Reagan called Medicare socialism and warned that it would lead to the end of freedom. If Medicare passed, the Gipper said, "... one of these days, you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it once was like in America when men were free." A half-century after Reagan's dire warning, I suspect most Americans see Medicare -- the single-payer health system that covers seniors -- as an essential element of our freedom. But not Congressman Ryan, nor many other Republicans. Ryan would end Medicare as we know it, replacing it with a voucher that seniors would take to insurance companies, upon whose tender mercies their lives and health would then depend. Establishment big shots hail Ryan's "courage," but ordinary Americans may not see his plan as courageous. More like mean-spirited. Opinion: GOP's high-stakes gamble to slash deficit Only among Beltway elites is it considered courageous to deny ill and infirm seniors the health care they deserve -- while giving oil companies billions in taxpayer subsidies. Most Americans have a different definition of courage. They think courage is taking on oil companies, corporate special interests and billionaire polluters. But that's not in the GOP playbook.

There is no doubt that Mr. Ryan is bright. He is also engaging and charming. But forgive me if I fail to see the courage in a young and privileged man harming the most vulnerable while rewarding the most wealthy. Born to a family whose 125-year-old corporation boasts that it is "one of the nation's largest site-work contractors," Mr. Ryan won the genetic lottery. There is no doubt that his great-grandfather worked hard to build that company. But a century and a quarter later, young Mr. Ryan -- who estimates his net worth at up to $2.4 million -- has no calluses on his hands. Just on his heart. The question for Republicans is, will they follow Ryan's plan? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that under Ryan's plan, "most elderly people would pay more for their health care than they would under the current Medicare system." A lot more. In fact, under Medicare, a 65-year-old would pay just 25% of the total cost of her or his health care coverage. Under the Ryan Republican plan, that jumps to 68%. (Individuals currently 55 or older would not be affected by the changes.) If Republicans follow Ryan like lemmings, they should not be surprised when they find they've taken a firm step into thin air. Back in 1995, Newt Gingrich virtually assured President Bill Clinton's re-election by proposing $270 billion in cuts to Medicare. Clinton famously refused to go along, and the government was shut down twice in late 1995. Clinton's approval rating bounced around a bit during the shutdowns, but the resolve he showed -- and the popularity of the Medicare program he was defending -- placed his poll numbers on a steady upward rise. Clinton's defense of Medicare was so central to his re-election that the word "Medicare" appears 49 times in his two debates with Sen. Bob Dole. So Mr. Ryan's proposal is neither courageous nor new. In fact, then-Vice President Al Gore saw it coming. Fifteen years ago, he said of the Republicans: "They want to give health insurance rip-off artists a license to change Medicare, to let this program for our seniors wither on the vine." Gore served under a president who was willing to stand strong to protect Medicare. I believe Barack Obama will stand just as strong against a GOP proposal that is even more harsh than Gingrich's. Presidential spokesman Jay Carney did not mince words in describing the president's disdain for Ryan's assault on Medicare. "Any plan to reduce our deficit must reflect the American values of fairness and shared sacrifice," he said. "Congressman Ryan's plan fails this test." And so we know where Paul Ryan stands: He wants to abolish Medicare. And we know where Obama stands: He wants to save Medicare. The question is, where do the congressional Republicans stand? Will they once again succumb to the sirens' song of pseudo-courage and run once more into the Medicare buzz saw? Or will they show true grit and reduce the deficit by taking on billionaire polluters, oil companies and corporate special interests? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.

Timeline: Greece's financial crisis By Nick Thompson, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSGreece's financial crisis threatens to destabilize the entire eurozoneReckless spending and borrowing left Greece on the brink of financial ruinA 110 billion euro bailout package last year failed to end Greece's economic problems (CNN) -- Greece's economy has been in a mostly downward spiral since the country joined the euro in 2001. While their eurozone peers had expressed their concern about the state of the Greek economy for years, it wasn't until the global financial crisis hit that the depth of the problem was revealed. Years of reckless spending and borrowing had left Greece on the verge of financial ruin by the beginning of 2010 -- not to mention in flagrant violation of inflation and deficit limits set by the European Central Bank. Despite last year's €110 billion bailout and the introduction of harsh austerity measures, the country has been unable to balance its books. Greece calls surprise bailout vote
Germany braces for eurozone trouble
European leaders' decision in mid-summer to approve a second Greek bailout package also failed to calm international lenders' fears that the cash-strapped country may default on its sovereign debt -- an outcome that would have global implications. EU Commissioner Ollie Rehn said of the situation: "A default by Greece or its exit from the eurozone would carry dramatic costs for Greece, the region and the global economy." On October 27, EU leaders got Greek bondholders to voluntarily agree to a 50% "haircut" or write-down of Greek debt -- slashing the country's debt bill by €100 billion -- as part of a three-pronged plan aimed at shoring up Greece's financial future, returning stability to Europe's banks and expanding the EFSF bailout fund's resources to more than €1 trillion. But less than a week later, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou shocked the world by calling for a national referendum on international aid for his country -- despite already agreeing in principle to implement reforms in order to meet Greek bondholders' terms -- which, if rejected, could lead to a Greek default and the country's exit from the euro. CNN takes a look at the key moments of the Greek financial crisis.

USDA lifts quarantines on two farms in mad cow investigation By Todd Sperry, CNN
updated 8:20 PM EDT, Fri May 18, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A cow tested positive last month for mad cow disease
Two farms were placed under quarantine as investigators examined feed
The feed didn't cause the cow to develop the disease, officials say
Washington (CNN) -- A quarantine placed on two California farms under investigation for mad cow disease has been lifted, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Friday.
The farm where the cow was discovered had been under quarantine since the dairy cow tested positive, agriculture officials said. Officials later placed a second farm under quarantine because that farm was linked to the dairy cow, according to the USDA.
Officials had focused attention on the feed suppliers and animal feed at both farms but now say the feed didn't cause the cow to develop the brain-wasting disease.
After it completed its own testing of the cow, the USDA sent samples to The World Organization for Animal Health in Canada and England where both laboratories confirmed the cow tested positive for atypical Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, known commonly as mad cow disease, officials said.
Increasing evidence shows there are different strains of BSE: the typical strain responsible for an outbreak in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and 1990s, and two atypical strains (H and L strains), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials said the infected cow found in California on April 24 had the atypical "L" strain of the disease. USDA officials said the cow was never presented for human consumption and was not a threat.
The cow gave birth twice. One calf was stillborn and the other was located and tested negative for the disease.
In Friday's announcement, the agency said investigators were focusing on a small number (10-12) of cattle born at the same time and in the same area as the diseased cow which may still be alive and have records that might allow them to be located.
Eating contaminated meat or other animal products from cattle that have BSE is thought to be the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The fatal brain disease was blamed for the deaths of 150 people in Britain, where there was an outbreak in the 1980s and 1990s.
In people, symptoms of the disease include psychiatric and behavioral changes, movement deficits, memory disturbances and cognitive impairments. BSE can cause infected animals to display nervousness or aggression, difficulty in coordination and standing up, decreased milk production or weight loss. It is usually transmitted between cows through the practice of recycling bovine carcasses for meat and bone meal protein, which is fed to other cattle.
Since 2004, the USDA has removed the brain and the spinal column -- the parts suspected of causing the disease in humans -- from the food system. Unlike most other meat-borne illnesses, such as those caused by E.-coli bacteria, cooking does not kill the infectious agent.
Consumers who wish to exercise extra caution can follow the advice presented by the Web-based consumer advocacy group www.consumeraffairs.com, which advises the avoidance of brains, neck bones and beef cheeks, bone marrow, and cuts of beef that are sold on the bone. The group says to choose boneless cuts of meat and ground beef only if it has been ground in the store.
"Evidence shows that our systems and safeguards to prevent BSE are working, as are similar actions taken by countries around the world," said John Clifford, the Agriculture Department's chief veterinarian.
Last year, 29 cases of BSE were reported worldwide, down 99% from the peak of 37,311 cases in 1992.
"This is directly attributable to the impact and effectiveness of feed bans as a primary control measure for the disease," he said last month.

Saudi women going to Games is a sham
By Jocelyne Cesari, Special to CNN
updated 8:53 AM EDT, Wed August 1, 2012
Saudi athlete Wojdan Shaherkani, left, arrives in London with her father for the Olympics on July 25.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Jocelyne Cesari: It's not an advance that Saudi Arabia sent two women to the Olympics The country sent them to avoid a ban on participating, she says, but situation is dire at home Cesari: Saudi women and girls cannot play or watch sports, except girls in private schools
Saudi Arabia has one of the worst records on women's rights in the world, she writes
Editor's note: Jocelyne Cesari is the senior visiting professor of International Relations at the School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University and director of the Islam in the West Program, Harvard University.
(CNN) -- For the first time, Saudi Arabia sent two women to the Olympics -- Wojdan Shaherkani and Sarah Attar, who will compete in judo and track and field. But their participation is far from a groundbreaking step for Saudi women.
It was touch and go whether one of the Saudi women, Shaherkani, would even participate this year when the president of the International Federation of Judo said women wearing headscarves would not be allowed to compete for fear of choking and injury. The issue has been resolved and she will participate in a form of headgear that complies with Saudi's strict Islamic dress codes for women.
But if Shaherkani had withdrawn, it would not have been a setback for Saudi women because her inclusion was not a sign of advancement. The presence of Saudi women is the result of several months of pressure by the International Olympics Committee on Saudi Arabia to include women competitors or face being banned from participation.
The situation for female athletes in Saudi Arabia is bleak.
Saudi woman will compete with headscarf
The rise of the Arab female athlete
Saudi women in general are denied the right to practice sports. Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that prevents girls from taking part in sports in government schools. Physical education is allowed only in private schools. Women are not allowed to play in official sports clubs or even watch matches in stadiums. Girls' football, volleyball and basketball games in private schools and colleges are held secretly.
Because of this ban, finding women with Olympic level training was a kind of mission impossible. Only a few days before its July announcement that the two women would attend, the Saudi National Olympic Committee said it could not find a woman qualified enough to compete.
Most Muslim-majority countries have sent female athletes to compete in the Olympics for decades. More Muslim women are competing in sports today than ever.
But even when women are included, competition remains a challenge, particularly because of athletic dress codes. In 2007, the International Federation of Association Football issued a ban on the hijab or headscarf. But this year, FIFA has lifted the ban after testing new hijabs specifically designed for athletes.
In sports and in daily life, women have few rights in Saudi Arabia.
The country, according to a Human Rights Watch report, has one of worst records on women's rights in the world. Women are treated as legal minors and often must have a man's permission to leave their homes, seek medical care, participate in public life, study, go to government offices and courts or even make decisions for their children. The genders are strictly segregated. Women cannot drive.
It would be tempting to see the Saudi's decision to include women in the Olympics as a big step forward.
But as Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said: "An 11th hour change of course to avoid a ban does not alter the dismal and unequal conditions for women and girls in Saudi Arabia."
The signs of change for Saudi women are yet to come.

Eagle earns Wood long-awaited first European Tour title
updated 1:49 PM EST, Sat January 26, 2013
Chris Wood celebrates after holing an eagle putt on the final hole to win the Qatar Masters in Doha on Saturday.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
English golfer Chris Wood wins Qatar Masters by one shot after spectacular finish
He heads off Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia and South Africa's George Coetzee
The 25-year-old qualifies for next month's WGC-Accenture Match Play in Arizona Garcia denied a return to top-10 rankings as he tied for second place with Coetzee
(CNN) -- When Chris Wood turned professional in 2009, he came agonizingly close to winning a major title in his rookie season -- but it's been tough going since then.
The English golfer finished tied for third at that year's British Open after missing out on victory at his final hole, having been fifth the previous season as the leading amateur.
Now he has finally tasted success on the European Tour, landing a spectacular eagle on the last hole to claim the Qatar Masters on Saturday.
He headed off veteran Sergio Garcia and South African George Coetzee by one stroke to earn the €310,917 ($418,000) first prize, thanks to a 202-yard six iron over the water that finished 10 feet from the hole.
"There's an enormous weight lifted off my shoulders today. I feel like I can go on and win more," said Wood, whose only other professional win came at the OneAsia Tour-sanctioned Thailand Open last year.
Golfer Rory McIlroy signs with Nike
The rise of South Africa's black golfers
Sports giant Nike now has the two biggest names in golf on their books after Rory McIlroy (L) joined Tiger Woods at their stable.
McIlroy, currently ranked the No. 1 player in the world, has signed a multi-year contract reputed to be worth in excess of $200 million with Nike. The deal catapults the 23-year-old into the top bracket of sporting earners, a stratosphere Tiger knows all about.
Woods signed a deal reportedly worth $40 million with Nike when he turned pro in 1996 and the firm built their golf business around him in the coming years. When he renegotiated in 2000, a five-year deal was said to have earned him $100m. But of late, his star has waned.
Tiger's last major title -- his 14th in total -- came at the 2008 U.S. Open. The following year news of his extra marital affairs broke and he took a break from the game. Nike stood by him, chairman Phil Knight calling it a "minor blip" but the 37-year-old has struggled to recapture his best form since.
Conversely, McIlroy's star is on the rise. After grabbing his first major at the 2011 U.S. Open he took his second at the U.S. PGA Championship last year. He finished top of the money lists on both the PGA and European Tours, matching Luke Donald's feat from the 2011 season.
Despite being rivals on the course Woods and McIlroy's relationship off it has strengthened in recent years. They have been paired together numerous times at tournaments around the world, much to the delight of sponsors, marketers and spectators.
The pair are continually in demand and played an exhibition match in China, dubbed the "Duel at Jinsha Lake", for which they were reportedly paid $2 million. Both players clearly enjoyed each other's company.
Even at the Ryder Cup, after Europe had completed one of the most dramatic comebacks in the competition's history to retain the trophy and stun the U.S. team, a triumphant McIlroy and despondent Woods managed to share a joke.

Tiger's heir apparent joins Nike
Miguel Angel Jimenez has spent the past four months in the gym undergoing a rehabilitation program after suffering a broken leg in a skiing accident. The Spaniard underwent surgery after breaking the tibia at the top of his right leg.
Food and drink are just two of Jimenez's passions in life -- along with his trusty cigar.
Another love of Jimenez's is his Ferrari -- he might be laid back but the need for speed still gives him a thrill.
Miguel Angel Jimenez celebrates with a glass of red wine and a cigar after becoming the European Tour's oldest winner with victory at the age of 48 in November's Hong Kong Open. Jimenez and Ryder Cup teammate Lee Westwood toast Europe's victory in the 2010 event at Celtic Manor in Newport, Wales.
Jimenez sprays Jose Manuel Lara of Spain with champagne after his compatriot wins the 2010 Austrian Open.
Jimenez, puffing that trademark cigar, celebrates after winning the French Open in July 2010.
2010 was a big year for Jimenez, who won the first of three titles that season at the Dubai Desert Classic in February.
Jimenez with ex-wife Monserrat after winning the European Tour's flagship PGA Championship event in 2008. He won the Hong Kong Open for the second time in 2007, having also triumphed at Fanling three years previously.
Jimenez won five tournaments in 2004, the last of which was the BMW International Open in Munich, Germany.
In 1997 Jimenez was assistant to team captain Seve Ballesteros as Europe retained the Ryder Cup at Spain's Valderrama Golf Club -- the first time it had been played outside of the U.S. and the UK.
His 1994 triumph at the Dutch Open was his second of 19 titles so far on the European Tour, having won his first in Belgium two years earlier.

Jimenez: Golf's great celebrater
"I knew it was going to be hard no matter how I played -- winning on The European Tour is not easy.
"I've been knocking on the door in previous times and it's not happened. To get it today, to get my first win, it's such an honor. I'm so pleased."
The 25-year-old had led by three shots going into the final round, but then dropped two off the pace after the opening nine holes to bring back memories of losing tournaments in 2010 and 2011 on the last day.
"I've seen a few mates picking up trophies and I've been waiting patiently for my time. I felt like I was due to win for a couple of years," said Wood, who will qualify for next month's WGC-Accenture Match Play in Arizona after moving from 142nd in the rankings to inside the top 64.
He closed with three-under-par 69 to deny Coetzee his first European Tour success.
The 26-year-old stormed home with a 65, firing an eagle and six birdies to record his 21st top-10 finish.
He finished tied with Garcia on 17-under 271, with the Spaniard -- seeking his 11th European Tour win and first since 2011 -- closing on 66.
"Chris hit a great drive and a great six iron and then a wonderful putt," said Garcia, who would have returned to the world's top 10 for the first time in more than three years if he had won.
"Obviously he's been trying for a while and he deserves it, and after the start he had today, it's quite impressive for him to come back the way he did and win. I gave it my best effort."
World No. 4 Justin Rose, the highest-ranked player in the field and runner-up in Abu Dhabi last weekend, tied for 16th.
Meanwhile, the third round of the PGA Tour's Farmers Insurance Open was delayed by fog on Saturday.
Only a handful of players made it out onto the course before play was suspended, with halfway leader Tiger Woods holding a two-shot advantage after 36 holes as he and most of the field waited for their new tee-off times.

Porsche Carrera GT: 5 reasons the car Paul Walker died in is different
By Holly Yan and Martin Savidge, CNN
updated 9:59 AM EST, Tue December 3, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT goes up to 208 mph and has more than 600 horsepower
"It was beyond a super car. It is what we call a hyper car," a Car and Driver editor says
The car costs $450,000 new, and an oil change alone costs $900
(CNN) -- It has three times the horsepower of the average car. It's notoriously difficult to handle, even for professional drivers. And now, it's known as the car actor Paul Walker was riding in when he died.
Both Walker and his driving team partner, who was behind the wheel, died after the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT they were in slammed into a pole and burst into flames. Los Angeles County authorities say speed was a factor in the crash and are investigating how fast the exotic car was going.
So why is the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT so different from other street cars? Here are five reasons:

The sports car has a top speed of 208 mph, a very high-revving V10 engine and more than 600 horsepower, said Eddie Alterman, editor-in-chief of Car and Driver magazine.
Police rule out 2nd vehicle in Walker crash
"This was not a car for novices," Alterman said. "Actually, the Carrera GT program began as a racing program."
Todd Trimble, an exotic car mechanic in Las Vegas, said the Carrera GT is a "very hard car to drive."
"It's (a) pure racer's car. You really need to know what you're doing when you drive them. And a lot of people are learning the hard way."
5 things to know about Roger Rodas, who died with Paul Walker
2) It's incredibly expensive Brand new, the car costs $450,000.
An oil change alone costs $900, Trimble said.
3) The engine is in the middle
Porsche in Paul Walker's death "Not for novices"
Dad: I always told him I loved him
Having the engine in the middle of the car means it's more agile and turns more quickly than a car with the engine in the front or in the rear.
The Carrera GT is able to change direction "very quickly, very much like a race car," Alterman said.
"It was beyond a super car. It is what we call a hyper car."
4) It has no stability control
The Carrera GT is also unusual because it has no electronic stability control. That means it's unforgiving with mistakes.
Did a drag race kill Paul Walker?
"Stability control is really good at correcting slides, keeping the car from getting out of shape," race car driver Randy Pobst said.
How Hollywood handles the death of a star
Pobst coached the actors in the second "Fast & Furious" movie -- including Paul Walker.
Remembering Paul Walker
"Paul was by far the best driver -- a natural car guy," he said.
Alterman said learning to drive a car like a Carrera GT can be extremely tricky.
"Every car is sort of different. And this one, especially since it had such a hair-trigger throttle, because it changed directions so quickly, there is a lot to learn."
5) There are only 1,300 of them
Porsche made only about 1,300 Carreras GTs -- and they're disappearing fast.
"They're getting rarer and rarer," Trimble said. "Most of the time, when they do get wrecked, there's not much left of them."

Is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol? By Jen Christensen and Jacque Wilson, CNN
updated 11:19 AM EST, Wed January 22, 2014
There appears to be a shift in the United States in favor of relaxing marijuana laws, a topic that has dipped in and out of the national conversation for decades. Public perceptions about pot have come a long way, from the dire warnings of "Reefer Madness" to growing acceptance of medical marijuana.
Sean Azzariti, an Iraq war veteran and marijuana activist, speaks to the media Wednesday, January 1, after becoming the first person to legally purchase recreational marijuana in Colorado. Colorado is the first state in the nation to allow retail pot shops. "It's huge," Azzariti said. "It hasn't even sunk in how big this is yet."

Different varieties of medical marijuana are seen at the Alternative Herbal Health Services cannabis dispensary in San Francisco on April 24, 2006.

She became known for her involvement in the "Just Say No" campaign.
President Jimmy Carter, with his special assistant for health issues, Dr. Peter Bourne, beside him, talks to reporters at the White House about his drug abuse control message to Congress on August 2, 1977.

A poster advertises the 1936 scare film "Reefer Madness," which described marijuana as a "violent narcotic" that first renders "sudden, violent, uncontrollable laughter" on its users before "dangerous hallucinations" and then "acts of shocking violence ... ending often in incurable insanity."
Harry Anslinger was named commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics when it was established in 1930. While arguing for marijuana prohibition, he played on Americans' fear of crime and foreigners. He spun tales of people driven to insanity or murder after ingesting the drug and spoke of the 2 to 3 tons of grass being produced in Mexico. "This, the Mexicans make into cigarettes, which they sell at two for 25 cents, mostly to white high school students," Anslinger told Congress.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A crash is more serious driving under the influence of alcohol or marijuana Marijuana and alcohol increase sexual desire but lower physical ability
Excess beer gives you a bigger belly, but pot smokers are skinnier, studies show
Read this article in Spanish
(CNN) -- Looks like the ongoing debate about marijuana legalization in the United States has reached a new high: President Barack Obama's White House.
"As has been well-documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life," Obama told New Yorker Editor David Remnick. "I don't think it is more dangerous than alcohol."
Alcohol is the most commonly used addictive substance in the United States, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. It's legal for those 21 and older. Only about 22% of adult women and 11% of adult men are lifetime alcohol abstainers.
Marijuana, on the other hand, is classified by the Drug Enforcement Agency as a Schedule 1 substance -- the same category as heroin, LSD and Ecstasy -- and is illegal in almost all states for recreational use. As such, comprehensive data on the drug's use and misuse in the United States is limited.

Here's what we do know:
Addiction
Alcohol's addictive qualities are well-documented. Approximately 17.6 million people, or one in every 12 adults, suffer from alcohol abuse or dependence, according to the NIAAA. Alcoholics in withdrawal can suffer from anxiety and depression, headaches, insomnia, nausea, fever and even seizures.
The addictive qualities of marijuana are not yet fully understood. The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates 9% of people who use marijuana will become addicted to it. For comparison's sake, cocaine hooks about 20% of those who use it.
"There is clear evidence that in some people, marijuana use can lead to withdrawal symptoms, including insomnia, anxiety and nausea," CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta wrote in his story, "Why I changed my mind on weed," referring to medical marijuana.
"Even considering this, it is hard to make a case that it has a high potential for abuse. The physical symptoms of marijuana addiction are nothing like those of the other drugs I've mentioned."
Driving under the influence
Every hour, one person is killed and 20 are injured in crashes involving a drunken driver, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
A new study found that even slightly "buzzed" drivers -- drivers with a blood alcohol level of 0.01%, meaning someone who has had even one drink -- are 46% more likely to be blamed for a crash when they collide with a sober driver.
The jury is still out on the impact of people who use marijuana and drive. Early studies showed marijuana had a slight impact on the psychomotor skills needed to drive, but these studies were seen as limited since they were done in lab situations.
A recent study review published in the British Medical Journal found people who used marijuana within three hours of driving were nearly twice as likely to cause a crash as sober drivers. People who use marijuana in combination with other drugs or alcohol also pose an increased crash risk, research suggests. Munchies and beer bellies It seems logical to think that alcohol would make you gain weight. One shot of liquor has about 100 calories; a beer usually contains around 150. Plus, alcohol lowers your inhibitions, encouraging you to binge on pizza and nachos.
As for marijuana, even cops know it gives you the munchies.
Yet some studies on whether alcohol or marijuana really cause weight gain have been contradictory.
One study of more than 19,000 women showed those who drank alcohol in moderation actually weighed less than those who didn't over 12 years. Others have linked obesity and alcoholism; frequent drinkers seem to be more at risk.
Marijuana smokers seem to be skinnier than those who don't smoke. A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology found that rates of obesity are lower by roughly a third in people who smoke pot at least three times a week, compared with those who don't use marijuana at all.
The desire's there...
Drinking reduces your inhibitions and can certainly make you feel more relaxed in social situations. But those lower inhibitions can also lead you to engage in risky sexual behavior, studies show. Unprotected sex can increase your risk of catching a sexually transmitted disease or infection and increase your chances for an unplanned pregnancy.
And while serving as a social lubricant, drinking alcohol actually leaves you dehydrated. The body needs a certain level of hydration and blood flow for sexual arousal. Drinking too much makes it difficult for men to have an erection and for women to feel pleasure from natural lubrication, studies have shown.
Marijuana may have a similar impact as alcohol in lowering your inhibitions and reducing your anxiety, but some studies have shown men have a harder time finding pleasure during sex under the influence.
A couple of studies found that men who use marijuana regularly had more problems with erectile dysfunction and needed medication to counteract that side effect. There are no similar studies that look at women's sexual satisfaction under the influence of pot.
Long-term health risks
Over time, drinking can lead to liver disease, neurological problems, certain psychiatric issues and may increase your risk of several types of cancer.
Smoking marijuana is more dangerous than smoking cigarettes, experts say. The tar in joints contains a much higher concentration of the chemicals linked to lung cancer compared with tobacco tar. And smoking marijuana deposits four times more tar in the lungs than smoking an equivalent amount of tobacco, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. High doses of marijuana can also cause temporary psychotic reactions, such as hallucinations and paranoia in some people. Younger people with a family history of schizophrenia are at a higher risk of developing the disorder after using marijuana, seven studies showed.
Death About 88,000 Americans die each year because of excessive alcohol use, according to the CDC. Nearly half of those deaths are from chronic alcohol use -- liver failure, for example -- while the other half are attributable to acute situations, such as alcohol poisoning or a drunken driving accident. There are an average of 1,600 alcohol poisoning deaths, or overdoses, each year.
Weed can kill you too, as this drug dealer showed.
In all seriousness, marijuana affects your reflexes, hindering your motor skills. So marijuana-related car fatalities are not unheard of. And one study found marijuana users have a 4.8-fold increase in risk of a heart attack during the first hour after smoking because of the drug's effect on your heart rate.
That said, scientists believe that a marijuana overdose is highly unlikely. One study found it was safe for animals to consume about 30% of their body weight in cannabis without overdosing; that's the equivalent of a 160-pound person eating 48 pounds of weed at one time.

Money and Justin Bieber's teenage brain
By Peggy Drexler
updated 1:36 PM EST, Sun January 26, 2014
Justin Bieber walks on a beach in Panama on Saturday, January 25, two days after he was charged in Miami with drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license. The pop star is accompanied by his new girlfriend, model Chantel Jeffries, who is wearing the orange bikini.
Bieber turned 19 on March 1. He won't be able to claim the "teen" in his pop star title for much longer.
The year 2013 wasn't very kind to Bieber; a paparazzo died in oncoming traffic after attempting to take a photo of the singer's car. A week later, photos hit the Web alleging marijuana use by Bieber. The singer kept his sense of humor through the ordeal, joking about it in his first stint as host of "Saturday Night Live." Here he performs in Washington in December.
Bieber cleans up at the American Music Awards in November, but the young artist is left out completely when the Grammy nominations are announced a few weeks later. Add an alleged murder plot to the mix, and it's fair to say December 2012 wasn't the best month for the Biebs. Bieber's relationship with Selena Gomez seemed to end at the end of 2012, although their actions sparked rumors of reconciliation just about every other week. Regardless of their on-again, off-again status, Bieber chose to take his mom, Pattie Mallette, as his date to the 2012 American Music Awards.
The Biebs has a knack for concert mishaps. He managed to run into a wall of glass backstage in Paris in June 2012, and in the fall of that year, he got sick onstage before moving on with his performance in Glendale, Arizona. Here he performs at the Staples Center in Los Angeles in October 2012. In June 2012, the singer was all smiles as he held baby brother Jaxon at the MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto.
Bieber's immense fan base comes out in full force when the singer releases his album "Believe." The disc not only went to No. 1, but it also had the year's biggest entry on the Billboard 200. How many can do that and graduate from high school (which he did in 2012) at the same time? Bieber makes his bread and butter as a teen pop phenom, but his social circle is wide. His appearance as part of boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s entourage at a fight in May 2012 had everyone doing a double take. Lil Wayne and 50 Cent were also on hand.
When you're Justin Bieber, you get a $100,000 electric sports car for your 18th birthday -- and on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show, no less. The Biebs attends the NRJ Music Awards in January 2012, but he stays busy giving back when he's not hitting the red carpet. A month later, he made a special Valentine's Day trip to a girl suffering from cancer. Photos he shared from their time together quickly went viral. Bieber had some of the "most influential hair" of 2011 and also was ranked as one of the most charitable stars. Here, he showed off his style with Paris Jackson at the Michael Jackson hand and footprint ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.
Bieber was embroiled in a baby mama scandal when he attended the 2011 American Music Awards with Selena Gomez, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the happy couple. A year later, Bieber and Gomez would no longer be an item. Bieber attends the MTV Video Music Awards in August 2011 with a snake on one hand and then-girlfriend Selena Gomez holding on to the other. He won the best male video award for "U Smile" that night.
Madame Tussauds had everyone seeing double when Bieber's wax figure was unveiled in March 2011 in London. Bieber shows off on the basketball court at the 2011 BBVA NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in Los Angeles. Even former NBA player Scottie Pippen said he was surprised by Bieber's skills.
The pop idol attends the Los Angeles premiere of "Justin Bieber: Never Say Never," a 3-D documentary on his rise to stardom, in February 2011. He's accompanied by Usher and manager Scooter Braun.
At 16, Bieber was already an author. Here he promotes his book, "First Step 2 Forever: My Story," at a New York bookstore in November 2010.
Complete with a letterman jacket and a drum solo, Bieber surprises fans in an outdoor performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles in September 2010.
By early 2010, Bieber had notched a chart-scaling album with "My World" and was ready to release "My World 2.0," which contained the single "Baby." Here, Bieber performs at the Pepsi Super Bowl Fan Jam in Miami Beach in February 2010.
The Stratford, Ontario, native first attracted attention on YouTube. Here Bieber, in his signature purple hoodie, entertains crowds at Arthur Ashe Kids' Day, a U.S. Open event, in New York in August 2009.
At 15, Bieber had yet to become synonymous with the ubiquitous single "Baby." At this point, he was soaking up all he could learn from his mentor, Usher, with whom he attended the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in March 2009.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Peggy Drexler: There are teenagers like Justin Bieber on every block Drexler: A young person who has so much money -- and power -- can do crazy things
She says parents can instill values, but it's hard when a kid is the breadwinner Drexler: Still, there are teen stars who grow up fine even if they have a lot of money
Editor's note: Peggy Drexler is the author of "Our Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family" and "Raising Boys Without Men." She is an assistant professor of psychology at Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University and a former gender scholar at Stanford University. Join her on Facebook and follow her on Twitter @drpeggydrexler. (CNN) -- Cyndi Lauper had a hit in the 1980s called "Money Changes Everything." She has a point. It may or may not buy happiness, but money -- especially truckloads of it -- does change things, including endowing the holder of the checkbook with power.
Now, take a teenager and give him that power. What happens?
Justin Bieber, Lindsay Lohan and the other teen stars that have crashed to earth in a shower of tabloid sparks, may only be doing what a great many teenagers would be doing -- if they could.
Peggy Drexler
There are teenagers like Justin Bieber on every block. But imagine the kid who cuts your lawn suddenly having a net worth of about $130 million.
The same teen brain that convinces its host that he won't get caught if he throws a party at the house while mom and dad are away now knows it owns the house -- and it's a mansion, with Lamborghinis outside loaned gratis by a friendly dealer. Woohoo!
Vanilla Ice: Biebs, come work with me
What are Bieber's parents like?
It's long been said that by age 5 or 6, a child's brain is 95% of its adult size. But neuroscientists, enlightened by MRI technology, are discovering it is still changing -- creating connections, adding and shedding cells. That process is particularly active in the prefrontal cortex -- the part that makes judgments like drag racing through residential neighborhoods.
Dr. Jay Giedd at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, led studies that found the teen brain development was a process of adding and pruning. Significantly, he said, brain cells at that age are influenced by what the teen does. If he plays sports, the brain cells will make connections that help with that. If he sits on the couch and plays video games, then the cells will be hardwired for those activities.
The only real moderating influence -- as it is for any teenager -- is the parents. But instilling discipline and values can be a daunting exercise when the child is the breadwinner. It can be difficult to tell your child they can't have the car tonight -- when he's the one who paid for it.
Some parents -- like the Lohans -- are simply not up to the job. Others -- like the parents of Britney Spears or Amanda Bynes -- may have had their job complicated by what appear to be mental problems. Unfortunately, today, those problems are there for all to see. Every failure of a troubled celebrity teen spreads like digital wildfire.
Still, for every Justin Bieber, there is a Ron Howard, Natalie Portman or Jodie Foster -- child stars who navigated the rocky shoals of teen years into successful adulthood. Actor Rance Howard, in an interview, said he raised well-adjusted child star sons, Clint and Academy-award winning Ron, by removing their money from the family's life. "We chose not to live on what the boys could afford," he said, "but what I could afford."
Let's hope Justin will find his way. But romping in a mountain of money like most kids play in a pile of leaves, and surrounded by an entourage of dependent cheerleaders, won't make it easy. As the developing cells of his teenage brain react to the world around him -- money does change everything.

My Sweet Lord
Cosimo Cavallaro uses a brush to touch up one of his controversial sculpture's in his exhibition.His likeness is on watches, mugs, tattoos and dashboards. Some have seen it on the sides of buildings and in assorted pastries.But if you want to get a whole mess of attention about where to put Jesus, nothing beats a bath in chocolate.Call it blasphemy, free speech or a little bit of both, a Canadian artist has finally received the green light to showcase his religious-themed, cacao-inspired art.Titled "Chocolate Saints ... Sweet Jesus", Cosimo Cavallaro's exhibition (which opened this past Saturday) features a life-size, anatomically correct sculpture of Jesus. The shocker is simple: the diety is made out of milk chocolate -- 200 pounds worth.It's the artist's medium of the moment. And it's generating plenty of controversy.A few months back, Cavallaro was assailed in his failed attempt to showcase the chocolate Jesus during Holy Week. The Catholic League called it an assault on Christian sensibilities.That was then. As for now, Cavallaro tells the Associated Press he means no ill will to the Catholic Church, saying, "If my intentions were to offend, if I did do something wrong, I wouldn't be doing this. But I didn't do anything wrong."Do you agree?-- By Gabe Falcon, "360" Writer Posted By CNN: 3:12 PM ET 21 Comments Dear Gabe, Maybe I see this issue from a different perspective than most people do because I am an artist and studied art history in college, but I didn't understand the controversy over "Sweet Jesus" earlier this year and I don't understand it now. Although I am not comparing Mr. Cavallaro's "chocolate Jesus" to a great work of art, there is a precedent for it. There is a wooden sculpture called the "Crucifix" (1492), attributed to Michelangelo, in the church of Sto. Spirito, Florence that features the nude figure of Christ. It is said that his intent may have been to depict Christ as heroic in the fashion of a mythological Greek hero. Horatio Greenough employed the same technique in his 1840 sculpture of George Washington (Washington D.C.) whose pose was taken from ancient Greek sculptor Phidias's Zeus. This sculpture also caused great controversy, mostly because people did not understand its intent. I don’t know if Mr. Cavallaro's intentions are honorable or not, but he may very well have had the same reasoning. What is offensive about this piece? Is it that it is done in chocolate or because it is nude? If the controversy is based on the nudity, are these same people offended by Michelangelo's depiction as well? I think the Catholic League should be more concerned with the number of priests molesting children and less concerned with "Sweet Jesus." I think the priorities of the Catholic Church are sometimes dangerously misplaced. Jo Ann

I doubt that the Europeans would express this level of outrage over the depiction of a nude Jesus. I would be interested to know what they think about it. I know there are levels of decency that everyone can appreciate as far as nudity is concerned, but unfortunately, compared to other countries, the United States has always had an unhealthy hang up over nudity in general.

Completely. He did nothing wrong. Considering I've been exposed to everything from horrendous plastic nativity scenes in front yards during the Christmas holidays to the awe-inspiring beauty of the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican, I'd have to say this work is less of a tacky debacle and more of a piece of artwork. Have members of the Catholic League ever considered getting a collective life or taking a couple of art classes, especially in art history? I hope Sweet Jesus is a huge hit. And if I could only get the George Harrison song out of head now, things would be perfect.
Posted By Tammy C., Berwick, LA : 4:51 PM ET
He didn't do anything wrong. However, it will be interesting to see if all hell breaks loose like it did with the caricatures of Mohammed.
Posted By Anonymous : 5:06 PM ET
Hi Gabe,As far as I see it, there is never anything offensive about Jesus. This sculpture of "Sweet Jesus" does not seem in any way disrespectful -it is the artist's interprtation, it is not ugly, it looks well done. Jesus, from what I hear, was sweet, so what is the big deal? Clearly I must be missing something. This seems like a futile attempt by the Catholic church to remove the attention from their real problems. I for one am not buying it. They need to get real.
Posted By Pati McMillan, Camp Hill, PA : 5:34 PM ET
Some people take things WAY TOO SERIOUSLY in life. We ARE destroying our own planet, remember??? The only known one that is able to sustain life, right????But seriously, I think this chocolate Jesus should be melted immediately and shipped to me via Fed Ex. Overnight.
Posted By Debbie, Denham Springs, LA : 5:36 PM ET
Why do we assume that his sculpture depicting the Lord's crucifixion is intended as a mockery? Maybe the artist meant to honor Him.
Posted By Laura - Tulsa, OK : 5:41 PM ET
I think the Catholic church needs to spend more time on important things. They need to be more concerned about why they have to kick out nuns from their home to help pay for the lawsuits of their priests for molesting children. To me it seems like that would warrent more of a concern than some artist creating a scupture of Jesus out of chocolate.
Posted By Amber, Ft. Wayne IN : 5:43 PM ET
Let's hang a chocolate likeness of the prophet Mohammed in a hotel lobby and see if there's any "reaction". I think there would be!

I like it. It's not the artist's vision that counts anyway; it's what a person takes away from the art that matters. Looks like now there will be chocolate in heaven !
Posted By Steve - Peoria, IL : 5:47 PM ET
Looks nothing like him, just some chocolate-covered guy mimicking Jesus. Where's the beard?
Posted By Ann, Houston, Tx. : 5:50 PM ET
What bugs me is that when artists make a "controversial" depiction of Jesus, Christians are told to deal with it. But when the cartoons of Mohammed came out, Western countries including the US were "politically correct" and sensitive to Muslims, and didn't want to "offend" them by publishing the cartoons. Can someone 'splain the difference?
Posted By ronnie - knoxville, tn. : 5:55 PM ET
My bottom line is , just don't eat it. On the other hand, you don't see animals activists getting all worked up over chocolate bunnies being eaten at Easter, do you?
Posted By Mary C -Springfield, Mo : 6:01 PM ET
I thought the Christians were out of the Middle Ages. I was wrong. Fusing about this piece of chocolate is like complaining about the Danish caricatures of Muhammad. What's next, burning the Canadian consulates and the embassy?
Posted By Peter : 6:02 PM ET
With all the stories in the world to cover why is 360 bringing this one back? Was there a lot of interest? Ye gads. Cover something important, like why is Ann Curry going to get to see penguins as part of the Today Show's Ends of the Earth series and Anderson and Jeff did not see penguins? On Peril we saw tigers, elephants, turtles, polar bears and seals but no penguins. Penguins are where the story is. And chocolate is for eating and should not be embroiled in controversy.
Posted By Charlotte D, Stockton CA : 6:06 PM ET
I feel that people are totally missing how humorous all the controversy is. It's a depiction of Jesus... no one minds if you use stone, wood or fabric to make an image of Jesus. I am not a Christian, but if I was I would be thanking artists for bringing new attention to my Lord.
Posted By jamie r - rockville, md. : 6:07 PM ET
Come on people, get a sense of humor or go to church and ask for one !
Posted By AJ, Yountville, CA : 6:11 PM ET
Sorry but I think it's hysterical! Hy-ster-i-cal!
Posted By Anonymous : 6:14 PM ET
I hate to rip up the ideas about the "attitude" of Catholics. I'm not Catholic and I find it quite offensive.Perhaps the "artist" would appreciate an exact replica of his mother, anatomically correct of course,to be created in marshmallow creme and displayed for the world to see.Completely edible is the description given to the Christ figure. I'm sure his mother will appreciate the same love and respect that others feel for Christ.Maggie C
Posted By Anonymous : 6:15 PM ET
Ronnie:The difference between showing this and publishing pictures of Mohammad is that we don't expect Christians to riot and kill people. Some Western news networks choose not to show the cartoon, not out of respect or being "politically correct" (whatever the quotes mean), but because they knew that doing so would cause real world reactions that would lead to more people dying in riots. Are you suggesting that the news networks would have served someone, anyone, by publishing the cartoon in more places? They had extensive coverage showing how ignorant the radical Muslims looked, rioting because of it. Are you saying that Christians should aim for the same low standard?
