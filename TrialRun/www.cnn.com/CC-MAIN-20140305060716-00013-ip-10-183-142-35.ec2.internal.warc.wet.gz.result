40 militants dead in Afghan battleStory Highlights More than 40 Taliban fighters killed in 12-hour battle with Afghan, coalition forces 24 Taliban killed in Helmand province after ambushing joint combat patrol No coalition forces were injured or killed in the fighting, U.S. military saysNext Article in World » (CNN) -- Afghan and coalition forces engaged in another fierce battle with Taliban militants in southern Afghanistan on Wednesday, killing more than 40 insurgents in the 12-hour engagement in northern Kandahar province, the U.S. military said. Coalition forces have been fighting Taliban-led militants in Afghanistan. On the same day, Afghan police and coalition troops killed more than 24 Taliban in neighboring Helmand province after the insurgents ambushed a joint combat patrol, the military said. "Since Aug. 27, nearly 200 extremist Taliban fighters have been killed during failed attempts to attack ANSF (Afghan National Security Forces) and coalition forces," the military said. Wednesday's battle in Kandahar started when a patrol of Afghan police and coalition forces came under attack near the village of Alekowzi in Kandahar's Sha Wali Kot district, the military said. "They began taking small-arms and machine gun fire from approximately 10 insurgents," the military said. "Within 20 minutes of the battle starting, the combined force was further engaged by an estimated 20 RPGs, fired from the nearby Hutak Village." The insurgents were backed by an estimated 150 additional fighters, the military said. The Afghan force repelled the attack but called in coalition air support which destroyed the enemy positions with precision-guided munitions. No coalition or Afghan forces, nor any civilians, were injured or killed in the fighting, the military said. Don't Miss NATO urged to fight Afghan opium trade

U.S. military spokesman Army Maj. Chris Belcher said the successful fight was an example of the Afghan forces' "growing capability." He said Afghan police were "following in the footsteps of the other Afghan elite security forces as they begin to chart their own course in defeating the insurgency." Wednesday's fighting in Helmand province occurred more than 10 miles northwest of the Sangin District Center, the military said. It started when a "squad-size element of extremist Taliban" ambushed "the patrol with small-arms, machine gun and rocket propelled grenade fire from several buildings within the village limits," the coalition said. The security forces returned fire and the militants "reinforced their positions with additional fighters and also started firing from an extensive trench line located throughout the village," it said. Coalition aircraft were called in and pounded "positively identified enemy positions using precision guided munitions." Along with the Taliban deaths, a non-combatant was injured "by enemy fire as he attempted to flee the village prior to the engagement," the coalition said. Elsewhere in Helmand province on Wednesday, Britain's Defense Ministry said two British soldiers were killed and another soldier and an interpreter were wounded in a blast while on patrol. In eastern Afghanistan's Ghazni province, U.S.-led coalition forces and Afghan soldiers killed "several militants" after armed insurgents attacked the troops early Wednesday.

Obama meets with Mexican leader CalderonStory Highlights NEW: Obama: Ready "to build a stronger relationship with Mexico" Meeting part of tradition of incoming U.S. leaders talking with Mexican counterpart Security, the economy and immigration among issues on agenda Felipe Calderon to try to show Mexico's commitment to dealing with violence Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO By Arthur Brice CNN (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama met Monday afternoon with Mexican President Felipe Calderon in the first face-to-face talks of the incoming U.S. leader with a foreign head of state. Mexican President Felipe Calderon discussed immigration and trade issues with Barack Obama. The meeting at the Mexican Cultural Institute in Washington fulfilled a tradition in effect since 1980 of U.S. presidents talking with their Mexican counterparts before being sworn in, to underscore the special relationship between the two nations. Obama takes the oath of office on January 20. Speaking to the press afterward, Obama said the tradition is "appropriate" because of the "extraordinary relationship" between the two countries. "My message today is that my administration is going to be ready on Day One to build a stronger relationship with Mexico," he said. Calderon and Obama said the two leaders discussed a wide range of issues, including security, the economy and immigration. Security is a primary concern for Mexico, where drug-fueled violence reached record levels last year. The nation recorded around 5,400 slayings in 2008, more than double the 2,477 reported in 2007. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich characterized the battle among drug cartels and with government authorities as a "civil war" on a news program Sunday. "The more secure Mexico is, the more secure the United States will be," Calderon said, first in Spanish and then in English, to make sure no one missed the point. Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, attended a three-hour private dinner Calderon hosted Sunday night for non-governmental U.S. specialists and experts on Mexico. Security was a prime topic. "Both countries share a long border," Hakim told CNN on Monday. "They are terribly worried about the violence from organized crime in Mexico and slipover into the U.S." Watch how the meeting will highlight the two countries' special ties » That's a message Calderon wanted to make sure Obama heard. "This common problem of organized crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, which is an international problem, we can fight together," Calderon said after the meeting, again in both Spanish and English. "Mexico wants to make clear what they are doing about this," Hakim said. "They're investing a lot of money into it and the extensive reforms they are going through now." Those reforms include revamping police and judicial systems, trying to root out corruption and using new technology, Hakim said. "The message he has is that Mexico is investing its heart and soul into this," Hakim said. Obama will likely be receptive to that message, said Michael Shifter, a vice president at the Inter-American Dialogue. "I think Obama is going to understand that Mexico is very important to the United States," Shifter told CNN last week. "This isn't an issue that he has focused a lot of attention on up until now. But he's going to understand that if Mexico really deteriorates or if the violence spills over into the border states, this is a war that he really has to deal with." Mexico is also concerned, Hakim said, because of the vast number of firearms being smuggled from the United States into Mexico. Many of those weapons end up in the hands of drug traffickers. Robert Pastor, a former National Security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and now a professor of international relations at American University in Washington, said weapons sales are a thriving business along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico. "There are 7,600 gun shops within 50 miles of the Mexican border, and they're selling primarily to drug lords," Pastor told CNN recently. "We are part of this problem and we haven't been significantly supportive." Calderon probably told Obama Mexico does not want U.S. money but does want the United States to help curb that flow of lethal firepower, Hakim said. "Mexico wants the U.S. to be helpful where it can be most helpful," he said. The economy is another area of concern to Mexico, and Calderon would like the United States "to get its economy back in shape," Hakim said. "Mexico has done everything right and is suffering the U.S. meltdown," he said, noting that Mexico has kept budget deficits and inflation down and its banks are in good shape. "They come with a clean bill of health," said Hakim. "It's the U.S. that overborrowed, overspent and ran up huge trade deficits. Mexico had none of that." Obama and Calderon said they also discussed immigration, though Hakim noted that Mexico understands that issue is not a top priority right now for the United States. Asked how he sensed the mood of Mexico's leaders toward the incoming administration in Washington, Hakim said, "They're very hopeful." But he noted that there are some concerns, especially with trade issues and the North American Free Trade Agreement that the two countries and Canada signed in late 1993. Obama has said he would like to renegotiate the pact. "It's no secret they're a little bit concerned about his statement during the campaign about redoing NAFTA," Hakim said. "But my suspicion is that this is less of a concern than the other issues I mentioned." In addition to Hakim, Calderon's office said other participants at Sunday night's dinner meeting included Sidney Weintraub of the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas; former U.S. Rep. James Thomas Kolbe, now a fellow at the German Marshall Fund public policy institute; and Demetrios Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute. Calderon is scheduled to meet with President Bush on Tuesday.

(CNN) -- It was to be a somber memorial, a remembrance of those who perished in a lethal milky fog. To mark the 25th anniversary of the world's worst industrial disaster, authorities planned to open up the now-dilapidated shell of the Union Carbide fertilizer plant, where in the wee hours of December 3, 1984, 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas oozed out onto the sleeping city of Bhopal, India. About 4,000 people died instantly in the toxic leak, an event that came to be marked each year with disputes over victims' rights and government accountability. On this year's milestone anniversary, a new controversy has stirred. The state government of Madhya Pradesh planned to temporarily open the long-silent plant -- surrounded by concrete barriers and barbed wire -- to the public. It was to be part of a series of events observing the tragedy. Because everyone wanted to see, to know. For the same reason that a person visits a Nazi concentration camp or ground zero in New York. "Everyone wants to see the world's worst industrial disaster," said S.R. Mohanty, the secretary for the Relief and Rehabilitation Department for the Bhopal gas tragedy. It was going to be the government's way of reassuring its people that the plant no longer posed a threat to society. But the move sparked protests from victim rights groups and environmental activists. Just days before the anniversary, government officials backed away from the plan they had recently announced. The official reason, however, had little to do with the gas leak. Mohanty cited an election rule currently in force that prohibits acts that could be construed as attempting to influence voters ahead of the polls. Bhopal's municipal elections are scheduled for December. The plant could still be opened at a later date. Though officials representing the government of the state of Madhya Pradesh maintained the Union Carbide plant is perfectly safe, their plans drew criticism. Activists who advocate for Bhopal's victims viewed the plant tours as a publicity stunt for the government. It was another way to shirk responsibility, said Rachna Dhingra, an activist with the Bhopal Group for Information & Action, a coalition of agencies that advocates for victims. "They knew about the elections a month ago," Dhingra said, noting that on the 25th anniversary the government wanted to divert attention from the real issues. Thousands of people still suffer from exposure to the deadly gas and from land and water that became contaminated. Activists contend that neither Union Carbide nor the Indian government has done enough to help survivors. In the years since the poison cloud enclosed Bhopal, thousands more have died of contamination-related illnesses. The International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal alleges that survivors have received an average of only $500 each in compensation. Those who are drinking contaminated water or children who were born with birth defects have not received any money, the coalition said. Union Carbide, which was bought by The Dow Chemical Co. in 1999, has said it has no liability left in the disaster after it paid the Indian government a $470 million out-of-court settlement in 1989. The company has said it believes the leak was an act of sabotage. Dhingra said plans to open the plant to the public was disrespectful to Bhopal's gas victims. The government, she said, was eager to showcase the city as a shining example of recovery.

NY pot plan: Right step or bad message?
By Umaro Djau and Joe Sterling, CNN
updated 4:46 PM EDT, Tue June 5, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
One expert says the move is a step toward the "inevitable": legalization
The proposal has a good chance because Bloomberg and Cuomo support it, a professor said
A marijuana arrest hurts a person's chances for employment, the governor says
An anti-drug group official says marijuana "poses health and criminal problems"
(CNN) -- The New York governor's proposal to decriminalize the public possession of marijuana is drawing high praise from some politicians and police, black and Hispanic activists and backers of pot legalization.
"It is a step in the right direction," said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a prominent African-American political activist.
But some voices issued warnings about the proposal, with one group, the Drug Free American Foundation, arguing that it is not the time "to be backing off the marijuana law."
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo unveiled the proposal Monday and said the law would end a double standard that has disproportionately hurt black and Hispanic youth.
In 1977, New York's legislature reduced the penalty for possessing 25 grams or less of marijuana to a non-criminal violation carrying a fine of no more than $100 for first-time offenders, as long as the marijuana was in private possession and not in public view.
If the marijuana is out and viewable in public -- as it might be when someone is asked to empty his or her pockets during a police "stop and frisk" -- it becomes a Class B misdemeanor and can lead to arrests and jail.
The "stop and frisk" policy allows police to stop and search anyone they deem suspicious.
In 2011, more than 50,000 arrests were made for small amounts of marijuana, the governor's office said. Half of those arrested were under 25 years old, and 82% were black or Latino. Less than 10% were ever convicted of a crime.
Selling and smoking or burning marijuana is still a crime, and Cuomo is not suggesting changing that.
"If you possess marijuana privately, it is a violation. If you show it in public, it's a crime. It's incongruous. It's inconsistent the way it has been enforced," Cuomo said in Albany on Monday.
As a result, thousands of young people have wound up "with a permanent stain on their record for something that would otherwise be a violation. The charge makes it difficult for them to find a job," Cuomo said.
His proposal won praise from some legislators, police, the Manhattan district attorney and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
But some say the proposal is counterproductive.
David G. Evans, special adviser to the Drug Free America Foundation and a criminal defense lawyer in New Jersey, said the group is "very very concerned with this latest development."
"This can be seen by the young people as approving the use of marijuana, and they will most likely use marijuana. Marijuana of today is much more addictive and much more potent, and it poses health and criminal problems."
New York State Assemblyman Brian Kolb said he doubts legislators will back the proposal because of "pushback" from the community. He argues that marijuana possession is a federal crime, and "it does not make sense to pass guidelines at the state level that contradicts federal laws."
"This is a wrong message to send across the country," he said. "This should be a decision at the federal level to be interpreted for all the 50 states."
He said the Food and Drug Administration should make sure the plan follows the proper protocol.
"This is not a states-rights issue. This is a drug issue. In this case, this is a controlled-substance issue," he said.
But Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, said the proposal would address police abuse.
"We have been convinced, given the data, that Stop and Frisk does not alleviate crime but instead increases the racial profiling exposure of mostly young Blacks and Hispanics," he said in a statement.
Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the NORML Foundation, which supports legalizing marijuana, said he expects legislators to "faithfully embrace" the proposal.
He also said the proposal is "a political no-brainer" because most Americans will someday back "marijuana possession in small amounts." He said Cuomo, who might one day might have presidential aspirations, is positioning himself as the "marijuana law reformer."
Lester Grinspoon, a psychiatrist, retired professor at Harvard University and expert on drug policy, said Cuomo's move is "a step on the way of what is inevitable."
"Adults should be allowed to use marijuana responsibly, in much the way we use alcohol," he said. "It's not just because it's a civil liberties issue. It is very important to furthering marijuana as a medicine."
He said marijuana has been used in the treatment of cancer, multiple sclerosis, AIDS and glaucoma.
Robert MacCoun, professor of law and public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, said a dozen states have decriminalized small amounts, usually up to an ounce for a first-time possession, and most of the legal changes took place in the 1970s.
An expert on marijuana laws, MacCoun said the "decriminalization label has mattered less and less" over time.
"First, the other 38 states have become less and less likely to send convicted marijuana possession felons to prison. Second, states that have 'decriminalized' -- like New York -- still make lots of arrests for marijuana. Few of those arrested will end up in prison, but they may do a short jail stint."
And echoing concerns about the stain of an arrest for marijuana, he said, "there is a lasting effect on their records, which hurts their employability."
MacCoun said the "big change" over the past 10 years "is the partial legalization of medical marijuana in many states."
"Recent polls suggest that roughly half of American voters now support some form of legalization; if current trends continue, I think we'll see a state legalize marijuana soon, perhaps even this November. But there will be a thorny conflict with federal laws that prohibit marijuana," he said.
He points out that medical marijuana or decriminalization can't be confused with "true legalization." He called decriminalization a "sensible reform" and not a "risky" legal change.
"Marijuana possession sanctions have almost no measurable effect on levels of marijuana use. So it is not clear whether any valid purpose is being served by all the marijuana arrests in New York, and people of color are much more likely to be arrested even though they are not more likely to be marijuana users," he said. "Legalization is more complicated, because the steep drop in prices would be difficult to offset with a sustainable tax, and so consumption would probably increase."
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said, "the human costs to each defendant charged with a misdemeanor are serious."
"The simple and fair change proposed by Gov. Cuomo will help us redirect significant resources to the most violent criminals and serious crime problems, and, frankly, it is the right thing to do."
The governor's office said 94% of arrests for small amounts of marijuana in the state are in New York City, and Bloomberg, the New York Police Department and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly have come under fire in recent years for the department's "stop and frisk" policy.
Last year, Kelly issued a policy order directing officers to issue violations, rather than misdemeanors, for small amounts of marijuana discovered during street searches.
On Monday, Bloomberg issued a statement in support of Cuomo's comments.
"The governor's proposal today is consistent with the commissioner's directive and strikes the right balance by ensuring that the NYPD will continue to have the tools it needs to maintain public safety -- including making arrests for selling or smoking marijuana," he said. "Thanks to the NYPD, our city has come a long way from the days when marijuana was routinely sold and smoked on our streets without repercussions."
Kelly said Monday, "I was asked to respond to criticism by some members of the (City) Council that the Police Department was making 'too many' arrests for small amounts of marijuana. And my response to them was, 'Well, your option is to go to Albany and get the law changed.' Better that than having New York City police officers turn a blind eye to the law as it was written, and as it is still written."
And, with the backing of the mayor and the governor, it's hard to fathom any significant opposition to the proposal will arise, said Peter Moscow, an associate professor in the Department of Law and Police Science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.
"It's a positive move," he said.

Electric cars: Future of auto racing?
From Nina Dos Santos, CNN
updated 10:45 AM EDT, Wed October 3, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Formula E races will be held in city centers rather than on race tracks to highlight practicality
Rio de Janeiro is first to have confirmed its willingness to host an Electric Grand Prix in 2014
The electric cars will be capable of speeds over 200km per hour and will seat one person
Editor's note: Watch Quest Means Business on CNN International at 0600pm GMT Monday to Friday. Presenter Richard Quest is CNN's foremost international business correspondent. Follow him and CNN anchor Nina dos Santos on Twitter.
London (CNN) -- The power of fuel will be overtaken by electric energy in a new global auto race being used to showcase eco-friendly cars.
The Formula E series, set to launch in 2014, is aiming to rival Formula 1 -- but with electric cars.
Formula E chief executive Alejandro Agag believes the future of the automotive industry, particularly in cities, is electric. He hopes the auto race will help promote the wider use of electric cars.
Agag wants the Formula E series to take place in "the heart" of the world's leading towns. It will be showcased in "cities committed to clean mobility and sustainability," Agag told CNN's Quest Means Business. "We think we can be of help to those cities that are promoting the use of the electric car, by making it more popular."
Formula One strives for a green future Staging the races in city centers rather than on traditional race tracks will highlight the practicality of using battery-powered vehicles in urban areas.
Formula E representatives are in talks with major cities around the world about the contest, with a particular focus on emerging economies and Asia.
Formula One strives for green future
Singapore: The future of F1 finance? "We believe that cities are the natural environment for electric cars," added Agag. "The extended use of the electric vehicle will play a very important part in reducing city air pollution."
Brazil's Rio de Janeiro has already signaled its willingness to host an Electric Grand Prix in 2014.
Over the next four years the Brazilian city will be a global hub of sport as it hosts the soccer World Cup in two years and the Olympic Games in 2016.
"Rio is a city with a special commitment to sustainability, as the recent global environment summit has shown," added Agag, referring to Rio+20. "We will be proud to race there from 2014 onwards."
Singapore: The future of F1 finance?
He noted: "In Mexico we are coordinating with key figures including Carlos Slim (Telmex's CEO and the richest person in the world) and Federico Alaman (Mexico City promoter), to identify the best locations in the country."
The Formula E cars will be capable of speeds over 200 kilometers an hour, and rather than substituting tire at a pit stop, the driver will change cars instead. The plan for Formula E's inaugural season is to have 10 teams and 20 drivers, with the possibility of adding more teams in future.
The auto championship will work in partnership with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) -- motorsport's governing body -- for the promotion of clean mobility and sustainability.
Agag wants to use racing to promote research into electric vehicles with a focus on younger generations, in an effort to push the message of sustainable energy.
He added: "To make people believe that they need an electric car and a more sustainable lifestyle... We want to show everyone what these cars can do."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
In the wake of election tie, Thomas Jefferson delivered most conciliatory address
Frederick Douglass said Lincoln's second inaugural "sounded more like a sermon"
Franklin Roosevelt's first inaugural delivered hope amid the Great Depression
(CNN) -- Stephen Prothero, a Boston University religion scholar and author of "The American Bible: How Our Words Unite, Divide, and Define a Nation," is a regular CNN Belief Blog contributor.
As President Barack Obama puts the finishing touches on his second inaugural address, one in which aides say Obama will take a "hopeful" tone, here are Prothero's picks for the top five U.S. presidential inaugural addresses:
1. Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural (1801)
If you think partisan politics are bad today, you should have seen the election of 1800. Desperately trying to hold onto power, Federalists accused Jefferson of all sorts of infidelities to God and country, blasting him as an infidel and intimating that he might be a secret Jew or Muslim. Soon each side was questioning whether America could survive rule by the opposing party.
The election ended in a tie between Jefferson and his running mate, Aaron Burr. (At the time, the Electoral College cast its ballots without distinguishing between president and vice president, and the two Republicans each got 73 electoral votes, throwing the decision to the House of Representatives.) It took 36 ballots before the House awarded Jefferson the presidency. Into this maelstrom, Jefferson delivered perhaps the most conciliatory inaugural address in U.S. history, "better liked by our own party than his own," in the words of Massachusetts Federalist George Cabot.
"Let us then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind, let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty, and even life itself, are but dreary things," he said in a classic expression of our great tradition of conciliation. "Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. ... We are all Republicans. We are all Federalists."
Bibles, oaths and parades: Inaugural trivia
2. Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural (1865)
sot lincoln dkg inauguration_00001820.jpg
The Gettysburg Address is the greatest speech by America's greatest orator, but Lincoln's second inaugural contains some of his most profound thinking.
In this address, which according to Frederick Douglass "sounded more like a sermon than a state paper," Lincoln thinks out loud about the ways and means of Providence in the midst of the bloodletting of the Civil War.
A lesser man might have denounced the Confederates as evildoers, or called God to his side. Instead Lincoln coolly observed the battleground where theology and the military meet: "Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. ... The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes."
After this astounding flight of theological humility, Lincoln ended his remarks with another great statement of conciliation, urging his fellow Americans, North and South, to act "with malice toward none, with charity for all." Good advice, that, for civil wars and culture wars alike.
Quiz: How well do you know your inauguration history?
3. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first inaugural (1933)
Like Jefferson and Lincoln, FDR delivered his first inaugural address in a moment of crisis, though this time the crisis was economic rather than political or military. In an era before food stamps and Social Security, the Great Depression had put two out of every five Americans out of work. Farm prices were collapsing. Factories were closing. The banking system was convulsing. The stock market was crashing.
Into this grim situation FDR delivered hope.
"This is a national consecration," he began, and then got right to the point: "So, first of all, let me assert my belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself -- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."
Strictly speaking, this sentiment makes no sense. Fear itself aside, there is always plenty to fear. But Roosevelt struck the right chord for the moment, and his reassuring words paved the way for the massive overhaul of the federal government now known as the New Deal.
10 inaugural moments that mattered
4. John F. Kennedy's inaugural address (1961)
John F. Kennedy, 1961
John F. Kennedy's first and only inaugural was a Cold War speech that barely mentioned domestic policy. It takes us back to a time when the lines between liberals and conservatives were harder to draw -- when an upstart Massachusetts Democrat like Kennedy could run to the right of the sitting Republican president and war hero Dwight D. Eisenhower on foreign policy.
It also recalls an era when presidents would actually call for sacrifice. Today politicians tell us what our country can do for us, or they demand that our country leave us alone. Kennedy told us to put the interests of the nation above region, party, and even self.
"Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country," he said, in a line that inspired a generation to enter into the newly formed Peace Corps and other forms of public service. In a less known but equally apropos line he said, "Civility is not a sign of weakness. ... Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us."
5. Ronald Reagan's first inaugural (1981)
Ronald Reagan, 1981
Ronald Reagan's first inaugural address isn't on its own terms a classic. But it was historic in the sense that FDR's first inaugural was historic. While FDR paved the way for the New Deal, Reagan set the groundwork for its gradual dismantling.
Ironically, FDR was Reagan's hero. But here Reagan turned on the big government FDR had ushered in, giving the policies of his predecessor a clear rebuke. "In this present crisis," he said, "government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem."
Reagan's first inauguration came on the same day that 52 American hostages were released from Iran. So the celebrations were particularly keen. But in retrospect the day was most important for ushering in the Reagan Revolution and the fears of big government and high taxes that continue to haunt us today.

Girl's long-awaited lung transplant complete
From Jason Carroll and Chris Welch, CNN
updated 9:08 AM EDT, Thu June 13, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Sarah Murnaghan's family says there were no issues during her lung transplant
NEW: Surgery took six hours, Sarah did 'extremely well," family spokesman says
Her family fought to change the policy for children's lung transplants
Organization overseeing transplants ruled Monday to make children under 12 eligible for priority on adult lists
(CNN) -- Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl with cystic fibrosis whose family fought to have young children prioritized for adult organs, received new lungs Wednesday, her family told CNN.
Her surgery took about six hours, and there were no complications resizing or transplanting the adult lungs, according to family spokeswoman Tracy Simon.
A statement said the family was elated and that the doctors say Sarah's prognosis is good.
"We expect it will be a long road, but we're not going for easy, we're going for possible. And an organ donor has made this possible for her," the family said, calling the family of the deceased person who donated the lungs "true heroes."
Sarah "did extremely well" and was in intensive care after the procedure, Simon said.
10-year-old in ICU after lung transplant
Too young for adult lungs?
Judge adds dying girl to transplant list
The parents' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight. Earlier this week, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network's executive committee approved a one-year change that makes children younger than 12 eligible for priority on adult lung transplant lists.
Sarah received lungs donated by an adult, according to Simon, meaning the lungs needed to be modified. An OPTN news release said Monday that since 2007 only one patient younger than 12 had received adult lungs.
Sarah has been in and out of hospitals her entire life, but her condition worsened this year. Her lungs had been deteriorating rapidly over the past few months -- much faster than anyone in her family expected. In May, doctors told her mother, Janet Murnaghan, that Sarah had less than five weeks to live.
With just weeks left, Sarah fights the system for life-saving pair of lungs
"We knew at some point, she would need new lungs," her father, Fran Murnaghan, said in May. "We had hoped it would be much further down the road, but the disease has progressed."
At that time, Sarah had been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months.
The Murnaghans were under the impression that the transplant would happen any day, since she was the first candidate on the priority list for children in her region.
But children's organs rarely become available. In 2012, there were just 10 transplants in Sarah's age group, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing. Comparatively, there were more than 1,700 adult transplants in the same year. Only people 12 years and older qualified for the adult lungs.
Doctors previously have said they believe modified adult lungs could save Sarah's life.
Last week, the Murnaghans contacted a lawyer, who petitioned Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to change the rules that keep children under 12 from being prioritized for donated lungs.
Sebelius had previously told the family that she didn't have the authority to intervene in a particular case, but she did also call for a policy review. Any change in the policy, though, could take up to two years -- time the Murnaghans didn't have.
So in the letter last week they argued the rule was making it all but impossible for Sarah to receive a lung; every adult on the list would have to turn down the lung to let the little girl have it.
"The Under 12 Rule is unfair, arbitrary and capricious, inconsistent with the statute and regulations, and stands in the way of Sarah potentially receiving a set of lungs that she needs to live," wrote Stephen G. Harvey, the family's lawyer.
Dying girl's plight sparks fight over organ transplants "We have never, ever asked that Sarah get special attention or be placed in front of anyone more severe than her," her father said at the time. "So if there... is another adult who is more severe, who has a higher lung allocation score, they will still get their lungs first."
Several factors determine someone's place in line on the adult list: distance from donor to potential recipient, a lung allocation score determined by a patient's diagnosis and test results, and a patient's blood type.
Sarah's parents said her score was a 78. It went up to a 91 this week, according to a family spokeswoman. Anything above 60 is considered a high score, according to the OPTN's ranking system, and means a transplant need is particularly urgent.
Several lawmakers also got involved urging Sebelius to act. Rep. Patrick Meehan and Sen. Pat Toomey, two Pennsylvania Republicans, co-signed a letter sent to HHS. It read: "You have the ability and authority to intervene to allow for Sarah and other children under the age of 12 to become eligible for adult organs."
On June 5, the Murnaghan family asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block Sebelius from having the agency that oversees transplants apply the policy. The judge granted the injunction and ordered Sebelius to direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to waive the rule in Sarah's case.
A letter from Sebelius was sent to the OPTN the following day directing them to comply with the judge's order.
OPTN created a second candidate record for Murnaghan that fudged her birth date so the system would treat her as a 12-year-old allowing her to wait on the adult transplant list. Her original record as a 10-year-old also was kept, allowing her to remain first in line for a pediatric lung donation, as well.
On the same day he granted the injunction in Sarah's case, Judge Michael Baylson also granted a similar injunction in the case of 11-year-old Javier Acosta, making him eligible for adult lung.
Mother who lost one son fights for the other to get new lungs
On Monday, the OPTN took further action, with the group's executive committee approving the change for children under 12.

US Airways passenger tests negative for tuberculosis
By CNN Staff
updated 12:36 PM EST, Tue December 3, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Passenger pulled from US Airways Flight 2846 has tested negative for TB
Health officials are not recommending other passengers seek medical care
Man was removed in Phoenix after CDC added him to Do Not Board list
(CNN) -- A man suspected of flying with tuberculosis tested negative for the disease, according to Maricopa County health officials, meaning there was never a risk to other passengers on his flight.
The man was held in Phoenix from Saturday until Monday night, when he was released from the hospital. He is free to travel as he is no longer on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's "Do Not Board" list, health officials said.
Passengers aboard US Airways Flight 2846 were waiting on the tarmac at Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport on Friday when their pilot came on the intercom.
"We've been notified about a health emergency aboard the aircraft," passenger Dean Davidson heard.
A few minutes later, Davidson saw a flight attendant walk toward another passenger sitting a few rows ahead of him. The flight attendant handed the slender middle-aged man a medical mask.
Emergency personnel boarded the plane a short time later and removed the man, Davidson said. A firefighter then came on the intercom and announced that the passenger had active tuberculosis and was contagious and that other passengers on the flight had been exposed. He advised them to contact their physicians immediately, Davidson said.
The Phoenix Fire Department was operating under the assumption that the CDC only puts a passenger on its "Do Not Board" list if the passenger has a confirmed infectious disease, said Dr. John Gallagher, the fire department's chief medical officer. Gallagher and battalion chief John Mure instructed Captain Ron Horne on what to say to passengers aboard the plane.
TB scare on US Airways flight
Arizona health officials did not recommend passengers on Flight 2846 seek medical care because even if the passenger had tuberculosis, their risk of being infected was "very, very low," said Dr. Rebecca Sunshine, disease control director for Maricopa County Public Health.
"To put this in perspective... We're much more concerned that the passengers on this flight contracted influenza than that they contracted TB," she said Monday.
The US Airways flight took off from Austin, Texas, according to airline spokesman Bill McGlashen. It landed in Phoenix approximately two hours later on a layover before it was scheduled to fly to Los Angeles. There was no warning or flag on the passenger's record when he was going through security or when he boarded the plane, McGlashen said.
After the plane took off, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the Transportation Security Administration of a possible risk. The TSA then notified US Airways, McGlashen said.
Fast facts about tuberculosis Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which mainly affects the lungs. It can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys, spine and brain. There are two types of TB: latent TB infection, which is not contagious, and TB disease, which is contagious.
A person infected with latent TB shows no sign of symptoms and may not feel sick. Someone with TB disease usually feels ill; they may be coughing up blood and may have a fever, night sweats and/or chest pain.
TB spreads through the air when a person with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes or speaks. Germs can stay in the air for hours. People who contract TB must take several medications for six to nine months to combat the infection, according to the CDC.
Some varieties of the TB bacterium have developed a resistance to common antibiotics and may be more difficult to treat. People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, are particularly susceptible to the disease.
The number of TB cases in the United States has been declining since 1992, according to the CDC. In 2010, the most recent CDC data available, there were 569 deaths from TB.
In January 2010, a person infected with an active case of tuberculosis flew from Philadelphia to San Francisco on US Airways despite being on the CDC's "Do Not Board" list, which is different from the TSA's "No Fly" list.
The Do Not Board list was created in 2007 after Atlanta lawyer Andrew Speaker traveled abroad with a drug-resistant case of tuberculosis, setting off an international health scare. Speaker insisted that he had not been told he was contagious; public health officials disagreed.
The CDC manages the Do Not Board list in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security. The list is authorized under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, according to the CDC. Local and state health officials can contact the CDC to request that someone be placed on the list.
"To include someone on the list, CDC must determine that the person 1) likely is contagious with a communicable disease that would constitute a serious public health threat should the person be permitted to board a flight; 2) is unaware of or likely to be nonadherent with public health recommendations, including treatment; and 3) likely will attempt to board a commercial aircraft," the CDC website states.
"Once a person is placed on the list, airlines are instructed not to issue a boarding pass to the person for any commercial domestic flight or for any commercial international flight arriving in or departing from the United States."
The Do Not Board list does not apply to other methods of transportation. The CDC reviews the records of every person on the list every two weeks to see whether they are eligible to fly again.
In general, airline passengers are not legally obligated to tell an airline when they are sick, said Jeff Ment, an attorney who specializes in travel law. Unlike cruise lines, which require you to disclose illnesses leading up to the cruise, he said, airlines do not include any language in the ticket purchasing process that would prevent you from traveling.
"If you have some disease and its contagious, where's the threshold?" he asked. "If you have the flu? If you have a really bad cold? I think that once you establish some rule that there has to be notification, it becomes a slippery slope."
As a "common carrier," Ment said, airlines are legally required to do as much as possible to ensure the safety of their passengers.
If a passenger appears too ill to survive the flight without medical assistance, an airline could prevent him from flying, he said. Or if the airline knew that a passenger had a contagious disease, employees could require her to wear a mask during the flight to prevent germs from spreading.
In this kind of situation, any legal troubles would more likely stem from a civil lawsuit. After the 2007 incident, Speaker was sued by eight of his fellow passengers in a Canadian court.
Ment said plaintiffs would have to show that the infected passenger knew that he had the disease and was extremely careless around his fellow travelers.
"The line is crossed when the person knows they're sick and intentionally tries to do something (to infect others) or acts with callous disregard for your well-being," Ment said.
CNN's Jacque Wilson, Chuck Johnston, Matt Sloane, Casey Wian and Miriam Falco contributed to this story.

But very few do wax rhapsodic about Candlestick Park, that condemned property by the Bay. It will be host to one last scheduled sporting event this Monday night (a 49ers vs. Atlanta Falcons football game) ... and then, in 2014, boom goes the dynamite. It's going to be blown to bits.
Goodbye and good riddance. Camelot, it's not.
Mike Downey
A sampling of zingers from baseball greats about this pretty city's stadium throughout the years:
-- "I'd quit if I had to play here" -- Roger Maris
-- "If I was traded to the Giants, I'd quit baseball" -- Rocky Colavito
-- "A toilet with the lid up" -- Whitey Herzog
-- "We're lucky, we can leave, but the Giants have to stay here" -- Lew Burdette
-- "Candlestick was an abomination. It was a tough park to play in when it was cold, and it was always cold" -- Keith Hernandez
-- "We used to feel sorry for the fans, not for ourselves. At least we were moving around on the field" -- Willie McCovey
-- "In New York, they would have kept it full for more impact. At Candlestick, they had to drink half of it to keep warm" -- Steve Garvey (after a Giants fan threw a half-full bottle of gin at him)
-- "I bet I lost 200 home runs in that place" -- Willie Mays
-- "Dynamite" -- Jack Clark (asked what could improve the park)
And from a couple of former 49ers:
-- "Our home field was one of the worst places you would want to play" -- Joe Montana (a few months ago)
Wide receiver Michael Crabtree of the San Francisco 49ers catches a touchdown pass during the NFC Divisional Playoff Game at Candlestick Park January 12.
-- "It was a dump, but it was our dump" -- Dwight Clark (a few days ago)
Yep, those tributes keep pouring in.
In the late 1950s, baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants decided to go west to sunny California, lock, stock and jocks. The Dodgers got the sun part. They relocated to Los Angeles. What the Giants got was the "hate California, it's cold and it's damp" part that guys like Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra sang about.
Civic leaders in San Francisco, conscious of team owner Horace Stoneham's yen for tens of thousands of parking spaces that he'd never had at the Polo Grounds back in New York, zeroed in on 40-plus acres owned by contractor Charles Harney at a bayside spot known as Candlestick Point. The ground-breaking began in 1958. The ever-popular righthander, Vice President Richard M. Nixon, would toss out the Giants' ceremonial first pitch on April 12, 1960.
Nobody quite comprehended how unsuitable Candlestick Park's conditions would be for baseball. Famed lawyer Melvin Belli roared that Candlestick came with "the bitterest winds this side of the Himalayas." A 60-mph gust was not uncommon there. Balls hit out of the park by Mays and McCovey blew back into the park.
It wasn't so lousy for football. For the 49ers, a new arena wasn't paradise, but it was an upgrade from Kezar Stadium. Kezar's place in history today is mainly as the spot where Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood) put a bullet into the serial killer Scorpio (Andy Robinson) without a warrant or reading him his Miranda rights. (A moment you probably never get to see on NFL Films.)
The only difference between Candlestick Park and San Quentin is that, at Candlestick, they let you go home at night.Jim Wohlford
The Niners have been at Candlestick ever since. Monday's game marks the bitter end, unless Candlestick lands an unexpected NFL postseason contest or a farewell concert of some kind. (Paul McCartney supposedly is considering it.)
Bleacher Report: Candlestick Park's all-time greats team
That'll be that for a Northern California landmark of which ballplayer Jim Wohlford once said, vividly, "The only difference between Candlestick Park and San Quentin is that, at Candlestick, they let you go home at night."
At least Alcatraz prison became a tourist attraction for a while. Candlestick, a.k.a. "The Stick," will be reduced to rubble. Imploded. Disintegrated. Zapped off the map. They probably won't even scatter its ashes at sea.
What was it pitcher Jim Brosnan said of this structure decades ago? Oh, yeah: "It slants down toward the Bay and before long will be under water, which is the best place for it."
Damn, man. That's cold.
So was the park. It made Wrigley Field feel like Miami Beach. It got so cold that at least one player, Bobby Murcer, kept his bats in the clubhouse's sauna.
The park was usually windy and constantly wet. Montana, the famed 49er quarterback of yesteryear, recently said of Candlestick, "It could not rain for a year and you'd go in there and it'd be soaking wet. They used to call it The Quagmire."
From 1960 to 2000, the Giants played (endured) baseball there. Then they built a new park, AT&T Park, perhaps the most beautiful one in all of ball.
From 1971 to the present, the 49ers have played (enjoyed) football there. (A nice field isn't necessary when you win.) But they are about to move 40 miles south to Santa Clara, where they will play in a brand new place, Levi's Stadium.
(Maybe their uniform pants could be denim.)
I suppose that I've set foot in Candlestick Park a good, oh, 50 times in my time. San Francisco -- what a fantastic town. San Francisco's fans -- what a fantastic (mostly) bunch. San Francisco's teams -- winners, again and again.
But what will I miss about that park? Uh, not a lot.
What will I remember about it? Well, quite a bit, not that you asked.
THE BEATLES
Their final concert was there: August 29, 1966. At a press conference, the Beatles were asked how they felt about a rumor that "Day Tripper" was a song about a prostitute and "Norwegian Wood" a song about a lesbian. Paul McCartney, tongue in cheek, replied, "We were just trying to write songs about prostitutes and lesbians, that's all."
Preceding them on stage were the Remains, Bobby Hebb, the Cyrkle and the Ronettes. As soon as Hebb began singing his hit, "Sunny," the audience, which rarely felt the warmth of the sun at Candlestick, began to laugh. The Beatles' last number: "Long Tall Sally." No one inquired if Sally was a prostitute or a lesbian, or how long or how tall.
THE BALK
Stu Miller, a pitcher, was said to have been "blown from the mound" by the wind during the All-Star Game played there on July 11, 1961. He was not. All he did was sway a bit from a sudden gust. But he was called for a balk. The American League team tied the score in the ninth inning, but the National League won in the 10th on hits by Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Roberto Clemente (what a trio). Miller said years later, "The way people talk, you'd think I got blown into the Bay."
THE MEDAL
A "Croix de Candlestick" badge of honor was once distributed to fans who sat frozen solid at Giants games, risking pneumonia or worse. I was given one at the 1984 All-Star Game there. I also bought a T-shirt that read: "I Survived the All-Star Game at Candlestick Park."
THE FAN
Eunice Bull, 78, was in a box seat in 1989. A former fashion designer, she always wore a straw hat with Giants trading cards pinned to it. A fan behind her complained that he couldn't see. Ushers asked Eunice to remove her hat. Eunice said no. The ushers insisted. Lose the hat or be evicted from the park.
Eunice stood up. "OK, that's it, read me my Miranda rights!" said she, extending her wrists in case they intended to use handcuffs. She was led out. Sixteen years later, upon her death, Eunice Bull, a season ticket holder till the end, was honored on Candlestick's scoreboard, called "Perhaps the Giants' Most Steadfast Fan" in the Chronicle obit's headline, and atop her usual seat at the park, the Giants placed her hat.
THE FAN (part II)
Worst baseball movie of all time? "The Fan," filmed at Candlestick, featured a deranged fan, played by Robert De Niro, who murdered a Giants player, kidnapped another player's child, then disguised himself on the field as a catcher while the Giants played a game in a torrential downpour. No, it was not a comedy, at least not an intentional one.
THE CRAB
Crazy Crab was introduced as the new Giants mascot. He was not, uh, a hit. Players mooned him, put hot ointment in his costume armpits, even turned a hose on him. Greg Minton, a pitcher, said: "Crazy Crab stood out. The fans hated him and the players hated him."
THE CATCH
January 10, 1982, National Football Conference championship game, 49ers vs. Dallas Cowboys, winner goes to the Super Bowl: I am in the press box. Behind me, pacing back and forth, is Tex Schramm, the aptly named Cowboys team president. "Come on, babies. Come on, babies," Tex keeps saying. His team is ahead 27-21 in the fourth quarter, but the 49ers are on the move. Montana looks for a receiver. He throws high -- too high, it looks. Dwight Clark makes the catch! Touchdown, 49ers! Candlestick rocks.
THE QUAKE
October 18, 1989, with Game 3 of the World Series getting under way: Candlestick REALLY rocks. "We're having an earth...." Al Michaels reports on live TV, although viewers can't quite catch his final syllable. It is the Loma Prieta tremor, about to shake buildings and bridges in every direction.
Michaels does a masterful job. At one point, however, reporting that Santa Cruz was at the center of it all, 70 miles away, Michaels says: "Thank God the epicenter was far enough away from Candlestick Park so this structure remained erect." A somewhat testy Ted Koppel responds: "Well, of course, that doesn't do a lot for the folks in Santa Cruz."
THE BLACKOUT
During a prime-time clash between the 49ers and Pittsburgh Steelers on December 19, 2011, the game is interrupted by stadium power outages twice. I immediately became one of the 10 million or 20 million Americans who ad-libbed: "Now you know why they call it Candlestick."
Where it's flickering fast.
