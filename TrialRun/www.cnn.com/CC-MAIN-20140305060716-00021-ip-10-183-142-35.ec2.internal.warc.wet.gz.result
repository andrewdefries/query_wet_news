Obama's rhetoric meets realityStory Highlights Obama says not all of his campaign promises will happen at pace he wanted President-elect's tone has become more somber as he prepares to take office Obama says, "Everybody is going to have to give" to get things back on track President-elect's priority is getting his economic recovery package passed Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- In style and substance, Barack Obama is looking like he could be a different president than the candidate voters got to know during the campaign. Barack Obama has taken on a more somber tone as he prepares to take office. His message of changing the country has been replaced by one of repairing the country as he inherits crises that demand immediate action. "I want to be realistic here," Obama said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's "This Week." "Not everything that we talked about during the campaign are we going to be able to do on the pace that we had hoped." During the campaign, Obama stressed fixing the economy as one of his top priorities, but his recent language has taken on an urgent tone. Obama painted a dire picture of the economy last week, warning that if Congress does not take "dramatic action" on his economic aid package as soon as possible, the nation would face devastating long-term consequences. "For every day we wait or point fingers or drag our feet, more Americans will lose their jobs. More families will lose their savings. More dreams will be deferred and denied. And our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse," he said. It's a far cry from what voters heard from Obama the Democratic candidate, who inspired roaring crowds of thousands by telling them, "This is our moment. This is our time."

Obama 'determined' to break Mideast deadlock
But with the economy in a recession and people afraid for their financial future, Obama's soaring campaign rhetoric has given way to grim reality. And as if the economic crisis weren't enough, Obama has an international crisis awaiting him as well. The president-elect said Sunday that the suffering on both sides of Gaza's borders has led him to ramp up his commitment to working for a peace deal in the Middle East. These urgent items on Obama's agenda are forcing his team to reconsider some campaign pledges. Just as soon as he went from presidential hopeful to president-elect, Obama warned the nation of tough times ahead and lowered expectations that he would be the one to solve it all. Watch more on the expectations for Obama » "We know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime -- two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century," he said on the night of his election victory. "The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there," he said. He told voters that change couldn't happen without them, "without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice." He reiterated that same message this weekend, explaining what it's going to take to reform the government. "Everybody is going to have to give. Everybody is going to have to have some skin in the game," Obama told ABC. iReport.com: What should Obama do first? Some of the pledges Obama might have to rethink include his proposal to give some homeowners a 10 percent tax credit, an idea that has little support in Congress. During the campaign, Obama also told voters, "I don't believe in running up debt for the next generation." But just last week, he acknowledged that the cost of the economic recovery plan he is pushing would be "considerable" and would "certainly add to the budget deficit in the short term." Obama has not put a price tag on his stimulus package, but observers have estimated it would cost in the neighborhood of $800 billion. Obama also has proposed repealing the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy, but now it's more likely that the president-elect will delay any tax increases on the wealthy until 2011, when the tax cuts expire. Some of the maneuvering is aimed at attracting Republican support for the incoming president's recovery plan, but that could set up an early battle in the now heavily Democratic Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for example, is adamant about seeing those tax cuts repealed. iReport.com: What does Obama's presidency mean to you? Obama says everyone will have to sacrifice, and that includes Congress, too. Some political observers say the economic crisis that Obama is inheriting is raising the stakes to get a move on his recovery plan -- even if Congress isn't 100 percent behind it. "This strengthens Barack Obama's hand with the Congress and with the public. It's so urgent, that it's going to be very, very hard, I think, for people who don't like parts of this package to vote against it," said David Gergen, CNN's senior political analyst. And while the public is well aware of the economic battle ahead, Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ed Rollins said Obama has little time to wait. "You've got to have results," Rollins said, "He doesn't have four years to get it done. He has two years. If there's not improvements dramatically in two years, you have a midterm election, and certainly by the second part of this first term, this economy better be moving."

Stimulus money kept Americans off the street, study finds
By Matt Smith, CNN
updated 8:59 AM EST, Wed January 18, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The estimated U.S. homeless population has remained basically flat, researchers say
But a rise in people sharing housing is "not a good sign," an advocate says
About $1.5 billion in stimulus money helped keep people in homes, she says
(CNN) -- Federal aid helped many cash-strapped Americans keep a roof over their heads during the prolonged economic slump, but the number of people living a step away from the streets has grown sharply, researchers reported Wednesday.
The estimated U.S. homeless population dipped about 1% between 2009 and 2011 despite the lingering effects of the 2007-2009 recession, the Washington-based Homelessness Research Institute concluded.
About $1.5 billion from the 2009 economic stimulus measure went toward rental assistance and programs steering recently evicted people toward new housing, "and it seems likely that that has worked," said Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
Nevertheless, the homeless population went up in 24 states during the past two years, the Washington-based researchers found. And the number of people who have had to move in with friends or relatives -- often a last stop before the street -- is up as well, according to Wednesday's report.
The Homelessness Research Institute, the educational arm of Roman's organization, put the number of Americans living on the streets or in shelters at just over 636,000 in 2011. That's down about 6,000 from the group's 2009 estimate. The figure is based on reports and street counts from state and local agencies that receive federal housing funds.
Roman said the stimulus money, coupled with pre-recession federal programs aimed at veterans and the chronically ill, have kept that figure down even as the U.S. economy saw its worst downturn since the 1930s. But that money is drying up now that the Obama administration, Congress and the states are grappling with budget issues fueled by the recession.
"Just like all domestic discretionary spending, it's vulnerable at the moment because of the deficit," Roman said. States have already been cutting services, "So again, it's notable that these are still working."
The report found the effects of the recession keep cascading downward more than two years after its official end in mid-2009.
More than 4 million homes have been lost to foreclosure since 2007, according to the online marketer RealtyTrac. Those foreclosures have driven many ex-homeowners into the rental market, driving up rents and pushing some of the working poor to move in with family, friends or other acquaintances.
That "doubled-up" population grew by about 800,000 people between 2009 and 2010, the last year data was available, the HRI report concluded. About 6.8 million were in combined households in 2010, a more than 50% increase from 2005, researchers found.
"The most common previous address for homeless people is that they were doubled up with someone else," Roman said. The new figures are "not a good sign. It means we've got potentially a lot of people moving toward homelessness."
The number of low-income households that spend more than half their income on rent grew by 300,000 in 2009, to 6.2 million. That's about three-quarters of poor renters, the HRI study found.
But the figures showed slight declines among nearly all categories examined, including a more than 10% decline in the number of unemployed veterans and about a 3% dip in the ranks of the chronically homeless -- people with disabilities like severe mental illness or addiction that result in repeated or extended stays on the street.

A whale of a discovery makes scientific splash
By Ed Payne, CNN
updated 7:31 PM EST, Mon November 19, 2012
The male spade-toothed beaked whale that washed up on a New Zealand beach in 2010.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The spade-toothed beaked whale is rarest of whales
Scientists only had partial skeletal remains of the species before
An adult female and juvenile male washed up on a New Zealand beach in 2010
Only months later did researches know what they had
(CNN) -- It is the world's rarest whale and one of its rarest mammals.
Almost a thing of legend, scientists have never seen a spade-toothed beaked whale alive and, until recently, only had limited skeletal evidence they existed.
So rare is the species that when a pair of dead whales washed up on a New Zealand beach in late 2010, scientists didn't even know what they had.
But now they do ... and they're a bit giddy.
"It was a bit like finding the holy grail," said Anton van Helden, the collection manager of marine mammals at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. He's one of the co-authors of a paper published this week in the journal "Current Biology" documenting the discovery.

Whale injury a mystery
Another co-author, Rochelle Constantine with the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Auckland, made the discovery in 2011 while testing tissue samples from the whales with colleague Kirsten Thompson.
"When she showed me the result we were both a bit stunned," Constantine said. "We re-ran the sample again to make sure, even though the DNA clearly showed it was a spade-toothed beaked whale."
The results were stunning because only three partial specimens of the species were known to exist -- two collected in New Zealand in 1872 and in the 1950s and a third found on Robinson Crusoe Island off the coast of Chile in 1986.
The spade-toothed beaked whale looks similar to a large black, white and gray dolphin with its long pointed snout. Scientists believe they grow to be about 17 feet long. Adult males have large exposed teeth as the name suggests.
Mistaken for a Gray's beaked whale after their discovery, the adult female and juvenile male were buried near where they were found on Opape Beach. Scientists were anxious to recover the remains and did in early 2012.
"We now have collected the only complete specimen in the world of this rarest of whales," van Helden said. "Sadly the head of the adult female had washed away through beach erosion."
Still, the recovery of the remains is a bonanza for scientists who study cetaceans.
"Yes, the discovery is indeed most exciting," said geology professor Ewan Fordyce, who studies the evolution of whales and dolphins at University of Otago but who was not involved in the research. "Now we have an idea of the appearance and size of the species."
Its lifestyle and habits are another story -- not surprising for a species researchers have never seen alive.
Scientists can only guess based on what they know about other beaked whales, which are often boat-shy, spend little time at the surface and dive to depths of 6,600 feet (about 2,000 meters), according to van Helden. They probably dine on squid.
Yet, scientists are excited by the challenge.
"This is the species of whale that we know the least about in the world," Constantine said. "It has never been seen before, as far as we know, and for the first time we have an idea of what it looks like."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Allison Janney is spokeswoman for the Go Red for Women campaign
Janney played C.J. Cregg on "The West Wing" Janney has also starred in "Juno," "American Beauty," "The Help"
Actress lost 20 pounds by hiking daily with her dogs, focusing on diet
(CNN) -- Allison Janney was always on the move as a child. The "West Wing" actress played sports and enjoyed figure skating, so staying active was easy. But over the years, exercise took a back seat to Janney's evolving career.
"I think when 'West Wing' ended, I just went into a slump," she recently said.
We all did, Ms. Janney.
Thankfully the popular government drama is back, available for streaming on Netflix due to a new deal with Warner Bros. that sent fans to the couch in rerun ecstasy. And Janney has returned to her active lifestyle, dropping 20 pounds by focusing on her diet and daily hikes with her dogs.
Janney's had more than one high-profile role since "The West Wing" ended: She played the dog-obsessed mom in "Juno," a Southern socialite in "The Help" and Matthew Perry's crazy boss on "Mr. Sunshine." But Janney said White House press secretary C.J. Cregg will always be one of her favorite characters.
"I feel proud," she said. "I feel like I can die happy; I did something good. Not that I'm planning on dying anytime soon."
That's good, especially considering Janney's newest role is spokeswoman for the American Heart Association's Go Red for Women campaign.
The campaign aims to spread awareness about the No. 1 killer of women: heart disease.
Heart problems are expensive
Medicare covers yoga for heart disease
Soledad stuns in red for heart health
Heart disease kills one woman every minute, according to the American Heart Association, and the gap between women's and men's survival rates continues to widen.
Janney comes from a long line of "cream and butter" lovers, she said. Her family's history of heart disease -- including a grandfather who died of a heart attack -- led her to volunteer for the campaign.
"I feel if there was one cause that I actually had experience with, and a reason to step up for, it would be this," she said. "I hope I can make a difference in someone's life."
CNN spoke with Janney about Go Red for Women, how she stays healthy and where she hopes her career heads next. The following is an edited version of that interview.
CNN: I love the dress that you're wearing in the new PSA; that bright red color looks great on you.
Allison Janney: I love it, too! Red has always been a great color on me, which is why I decided to do the campaign. (laughs)
CNN: What does that color symbolize for women?
Janney: It's blood. It's love. It's your heart. It's vibrant. It's alive. Red is just the most standout, powerful color I think there is.
This famous costume designer I worked with ... said the woman who gets to wear the red dress is the one who's the most powerful. It's the perfect color to go with this campaign, because it's all about keeping women strong and healthy and vital.
Survivor of heart failure dedicates birthday to educating others
CNN: Let's talk about the real reason you're working with the American Heart Association.
Janney: I had a bit of a scary experience with my mother who, like most women I think, ignored the symptoms.
She was driving, going to see the grandkids. She was in a motel and probably had what was a very small heart attack -- but a warning. She just thought she was having this unbelievable pressure and discomfort in her neck and shoulders.
She drove 10 hours to Dayton, Ohio, and drove right to the doctor because she knew something was wrong. He just couldn't believe she drove all that way. She went right into the hospital and had emergency quadruple bypass surgery.
I almost lost her. For that reason alone, I'm glad to be part of this campaign.
CNN: You mentioned that many women feel like they have to tough it out and just ignore the symptoms. Why do you think that is?
Janney: I think, as women, we tend to always put our own needs in the back seat to take care of our family or loved ones. My mother did just that.
Women feel they need to take care of everybody, (but) they can't take care of anybody if they don't take care of themselves.
Jennie Garth: Know your heart, know the risks
CNN: How did that experience, and learning more about heart disease, change the way you looked at exercise and nutrition?
Janney: I've lost 15 (to) 20 pounds since the summer. I've been doing Pilates three days a week, and I have three dogs, which gets me out walking every single morning. It's been nice to slim down and bump up the exercise.
CNN: Do you have any favorite foods that you've had a hard time giving up?
Janney: I don't believe you have to give everything up completely. I am my mother's daughter. I like cream sauces. I like macaroni and cheese, all that comfort food.
I love chocolate, but now I go for 88% and 90% dark, dark chocolate to treat myself.
I go for Greek yogurt instead of heavy cream in a recipe. It's kind of a game to see how I can take a recipe and make it healthy and still make it taste good. It's a challenge I'm enjoying.
CNN: So you like to cook?
Janney: I do. I'm not the best cook, but I do like to get inspired -- you know, get the cooking magazines or watch cooking shows.
Basically, I like to have people over to my house, because I usually hate going out to restaurants. So I'm trying to give them more reasons to want to come over to my house. Like, "Oh, my God, Allison's a good cook."
CNN: What else is a staple in your diet? What do you have for breakfast?
Janney: I've been doing juicing ... kind of an almond milk mixture. And then if I'm still hungry, I make steel cut oats or have oatmeal with some banana in it or a little agave to sweeten it. And that keeps me going.
I eat a lot of salads. Whatever I eat is mostly 70% water. I eat tons of salads and greens and peppers and scallions and avocados, my favorite food on the planet. I've been eating a lot of soups and one-pot meals, with quinoa, with chicken breast and tomatoes and thyme.
I really try to stick to that, and I find I feel better; I have more energy. I'm 50-something, and I feel better than I felt 20 years ago. So it works.
CNN: What do you do for stress relief?
Janney: I'm trying to learn to meditate. I haven't been able to achieve it successfully yet because I get impatient.
I do these breathing exercises where if I start to feel stressed I breathe in for -- I start at a high number like eight -- and breathe in for eight counts and breathe out for eight counts, until I feel like I can go down to seven and then to six ... and it really does calm me down.
Getting a dog I would highly recommend for anyone. Animals are great for stress. The morning comes, and you have to take those dogs out. And I feel better because I don't feel guilty.
CNN: What would you like to tell women about heart disease?
Janney: We only get to be here once; why not feel the best you can feel? Start making choices that are going to make a difference in your life and the people's lives around you.
You just have to consciously be aware that we're not going to be here forever. This is not a dress rehearsal. This is it. This is all we have. And if you look down and you can pinch more than an inch, it's time to start taking it seriously.
CNN: You've been called one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood. What haven't you done that you'd still like to do?
Janney: Really? Wow. I just signed up for doing a series for CBS called "Mom." Anna Faris plays my daughter. It's a multicam series, the first time I'll be doing that sort of format where I'm performing in front of a live audience for television. I'm really excited about that.
There are lots of types of roles that I'd like to do that I haven't done yet. I've always said I'd like to play action hero; a really physically demanding film role would be fun.
I want to be challenged, work with great people and find better roles. Like the role that I found in C.J.; I like the women that I play who are inspiring to other women. That makes me feel good about what I do, that it has a lasting impact on the world.
I want to do more Broadway. I want to continue doing film. I want to have this show ("Mom") with Chuck Lorre be a great success.
I just want to keep working, because that's where I'm happy, and I think that's what I'm supposed to do in this lifetime: keep working and keep experiencing and keep healthy and stay alive as long as I can.

By Lauren Russell, CNN
updated 8:44 PM EDT, Fri July 26, 2013
Justin Bieber was charged with drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license after police saw the pop star street racing in a yellow Lamborghini in Miami on January 23. "What the f*** did I do?" he asked the officer. "Why did you stop me?" He was booked into a Miami jail after failing a sobriety test.

NEW: Publicist for DMX counters report of DUI arrest
Rapper DMX arrested after failing a field sobriety test, South Carolina authorities say
He was also driving without a license, without a seat belt, SC Highway Patrol says
(CNN) -- Rapper DMX has found himself in trouble with the law again, this time with a DUI charge in South Carolina, authorities said Friday.
Troopers in Greenville pulled over in a 1978 Plymouth station wagon Thursday night after spotting it traveling erratically, the South Carolina Highway Patrol said. DMX, whose real name is Earl Simmons, was driving, he was given a field sobriety test and failed, the agency said.
The rapper was charged with driving under the influence, driving without a license and driving without a seat belt, the patrol said..
However, his publicist, Domenick Nati, said DMX wasn't arrested for DUI.
"He was arrested early this morning but quickly released," Nati told CNN. "X was given a breathalyzer test and easily passed it. He is back at his home in South Carolina and we are continuing our focus on his upcoming album and acting roles."
But the state highway patrol responded to a CNN inquiry Friday evening by repeating that the 42-year-old rapper was arrested and charged with driving under the influence, driving without a license and driving without a seat belt.
DMX has faced various criminal charges in the past, including probation violation, illegal drug possession and animal cruelty.
Maricopa County, Arizona, authorities said he was arrested five times after August 2007. That included a May 2008 arrest on drug and animal cruelty charges, when Simmons attempted to barricade himself inside his Cave Creek home, sheriff's deputies said.
Simmons also ran into trouble while in prison, being placed on "lockdown status" and forced to eat only bread and water for "jailhouse infractions." In February 2009, he threw a food tray in anger at a corrections officer, according to the sheriff's office.
In 2010 he was sent to prison after violating his probation. Four days later DMX was admitted to the Flamenco Mental Health unit for an undisclosed disorder.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"The Sound of Music Live!" has been eviscerated on Twitter
Critics weren't in love with the live TV event either
Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer starred in the iconic roles
Underwood is "proud" of their performance
(CNN) -- "The Sound of Music Live!" has become the new definition of "hate-watching."
Anyone with a Twitter account has noticed the tidal wave of tweets about NBC's TV event, which aired for three hours on Thursday night, but that can't exactly be taken as a good sign. (You know a TV show isn't going well when live tweets from DiGiorno Pizza are considered one of the best parts.)
From the moment NBC announced its live TV version of the Broadway classic, a number of "Sound of Music" fans responded with a resounding "why?!" So when the network unveiled its one-take-only "Sound of Music" on Thursday -- starring Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer in the untouchable roles of Maria and Captain Von Trapp -- it seems viewers were primed to tear the production to shreds from its opening note.
And shred it they did.
'The Sound of Music Live' falls flat
"Sound of Music" goes live on NBC
I admire their ambition for putting on a musical live on television, but this is a bit of a train wreck. #TheSoundOfMusicLive— Kelly Clinger (@kellyclinger) December 6, 2013
The hills are apparently NOT alive with the sound of acting lessons. #TheSoundOfMusicLive— Ash Greyson (@AshGreyson) December 6, 2013
I'm glad NBC is doing this #TheSoundOfMusicLive rehearsal. Once they get the audio levels sorted out, it'll be GREAT.— Steve Hayman (@shayman) December 6, 2013

Critics have commended country star Underwood for attempting live theater without acting experience, but they haven't been able to ignore the result.
"As her multiple Grammys and her legion of country music fans will attest, the quality of Underwood's singing voice is not the problem," said USA Today's TV critic Robert Bianco. "It's that she doesn't know how to use that voice to sing in character, or what to do with her face when she's trying."
Even though it's been repeated that NBC was re-creating the stage version of "Sound of Music," rather than the beloved 1965 film starring Julie Andrews, the comparisons between the TV musical and the movie were inevitable. At one point, Underwood had to go on the record to tell her critics that she's completely aware she is not Andrews. "I would never pretend that I was," the "American Idol" champ recently told Entertainment Weekly. "I know my place."
Yet that place may not have been in such an iconic role. There are some things that are so revered in pop culture it's nearly criminal to try to re-introduce them (see: the widely reviled plan to create a sequel to "It's A Wonderful Life").
Underwood is an undeniable talent, but the singer is now facing complaints for even attempting to portray the young nun.
"When Carrie Underwood stepped out on the (wooded, not grassy) hills and started singing, I wished the hills were alive with the sound of hungry mountain lions," said Time magazine in a review. "Why wasn't she Julie Andrews? Is being Julie Andrews so much to ask for? No chic pixie cut either. Heidi braids."
The Hollywood Reporter wondered if it was "perhaps unfair to ask so much of Underwood, to have to make Maria's journey in three scant hours." And, to make matters worse, "True Blood's" Moyer -- so familiar to audiences as vampire Bill that some viewers found it difficult to see the actor as anyone else -- didn't live up to expectations, either.
"Moyer is a better singer than Russell Crowe," said THR. "But he's no Hugh Jackman. Or Neil Patrick Harris. Or Taye Diggs. Or even Nathan Fillion. His attempt at conveying an emotional hollowness just reads as mildly constipated, his furrowed eyes and pursed lips doing all the work. He doesn't look stoic, he just looks clenched."
So it wasn't a home run. But that's not to say that there weren't highlights, with Audra McDonald's spectacular performance being chief among them.
Some have emerged has defenders of the show -- the first attempt at a live TV musical production in almost 50 years -- while a few more have tweeted their hope that the intense criticism of the production won't stop NBC or other major broadcast networks from giving live theater in primetime another try.
dear @nbc please keep playing live musicals on TV we snark because we love (though next time choose real B'way actors) #TheSoundOfMusicLive— Jennifer Martin (@j3nnb0) December 6, 2013
As for Underwood, it sounds like she slept well after going off the air Thursday.
"Glory to God tonight...I couldn't be more proud," she tweeted. "What a tough thing to pull off and we did it! I am so blessed!!!"

Michigan prison escapee captured in Indiana
By Shawn Nottingham and Michael Pearson, CNN
updated 10:34 PM EST, Mon February 3, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Michael David Elliot was captured in LaPorte County, Indiana
Woman says Elliot told her he was an escaped convict
"He just wants to get someplace far," she tells dispatchers
Elliot, 40, was serving five life sentences for four murders
(CNN) -- Escaped Michigan convict Michael David Elliot was captured Monday in LaPorte County, Indiana, authorities said.
His capture ended a manhunt that kicked into overdrive after a woman abducted by Elliot managed to call 911.
Locked in a gas station bathroom, she whispers into her cell phone, as he banged on the door.
"He didn't say where, exactly, he just said somewhere far," she says in the 911 call, telling the dispatcher about the escaped convict she says had abducted her some two hours before with a box cutter and a hammer.
She slipped away from him when they stopped for gas.

"He's knocking on the bathroom door saying, 'Let's go!' " the 911 dispatcher says to other emergency workers in recordings released by authorities.
The Sunday night call from an Elkhart, Indiana, gas station had been the first sign of Elliot, a convicted murderer, since his escape hours before from Ionia Correctional Facility in central Michigan.
On Monday, a homeowner in LaGrange County, Indiana, found the woman's Jeep Liberty in a residential area of the town of Shipshewana, about 20 miles east of Elkhart, sheriff's spokesman Arron Knisley said.
Elliot himself remained missing then, however. Details on how he was caught were not immediately available.
CNN first learned about his capture on Twitter.
Prison authorities discovered Elliot gone about 9:30 p.m. Sunday. He apparently pulled back the bottoms of two fences and crawled underneath to escape, Michigan Department of Corrections spokesman Russell L. Marlan said.
He was serving five life sentences on a 1994 conviction for killing four people, according to Michigan Department of Corrections records. Authorities warned the public not to mess with him.
The kidnapped woman, whose name has not been released by authorities, told a 911 dispatcher from her bathroom stronghold that Elliot forced his way into her red Jeep Liberty as she sat parked on West Main Street in Ionia.
He was an escaped convict, he told her. Murder, she said. And he had a box cutter and a hammer.
But, she said, he hadn't hurt her.
"He just wants to get someplace far from Ionia," she told the dispatcher.
Unfortunately for police, by the time they arrived at the Marathon gas station, Elliot had fled in the woman's Jeep.
He was seen getting on Interstate 80/90, but authorities don't know which direction he was traveling or where he was heading.
The interstate connects Elkhart with Chicago to the west and Toledo, Ohio, to the east.
Elliot was known as a good prisoner, according to Corrections Director Daniel Heyens.
"Nothing in this man's history would have indicated a high risk of escape," Heyens said. "He was serving his time."
Prison authorities believe he acted alone, Heyens said.
According to court documents, Elliot was convicted in the August 1993 murders of Vickie Currie; her boyfriend, Michael Tufnell; his brother Bruce Tufnell; and Kathy Lane, CNN affiliate WXMI reported.
Elliot and three others hatched a plan to steal drug money, WXMI said, and after they didn't find the money, Elliot and another man killed the four victims and set Michael Tufnell's house on fire.
CNN's George Howell, Rick Martin, Holly Yan and Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.
