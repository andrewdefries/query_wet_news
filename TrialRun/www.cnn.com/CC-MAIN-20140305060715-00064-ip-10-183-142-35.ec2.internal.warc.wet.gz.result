(CNN) -- A new national poll suggests most Americans do not blame President Bush for the current shortage of flu vaccine.But they do attach some blame to the government.A CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll released Tuesday shows just 17 percent of respondents said they blame Bush a "great deal" for the shortage. An additional 18 percent said they blame the president a "moderate amount."About 62 percent of those surveyed said they do not blame Bush very much, or not at all.The shortage of vaccine has been an issue in the presidential campaign. When the shortage hit, the Democratic nominee, Sen. John Kerry, said it showed a failure on the part of the administration to forge a health care plan. Kerry blamed the Bush administration for not paying attention to warning signs about possible shortages. The shortage first became an issue on October 5, when British authorities said they were suspending production of the vaccine at the Liverpool plant of Chiron Corp., an American company, because of contamination problems. (CDC asks some to forgo flu vaccination)Chiron had contracted to deliver to the United States 46 million to 48 million doses, nearly half of the country's projected need of 100 million doses. (Inspectors can't vouch for safety of flu vaccine)After Bush suggested healthy Americans should skip a flu shot this year to leave more vaccine for those who most need it, Kerry said the administration's bottom-line approach to health care was simply "don't get sick." (More flu shots will be available in January)The vaccine shortage leaves Americans with a supply of about 54 million doses of vaccine made by Aventis Pasteur, based in Strasbourg, France, and 1 million to 2 million doses of a nasal form of the vaccine called FluMist, made by MedImmune Inc. of Mountain View, California. (America's only flu shot factory in high gear)Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said it's too soon to tell if there will be a flu crisis this year. The poll, conducted from October 22 through 24, showed 30 percent of Americans blame the government a great deal for the shortage, and an additional 37 percent blame it a moderate amount. Only 29 percent of respondents did not blame the government. (Special Report: America Votes 2004, the polls)Most Americans appear to believe the drug companies are at least a part of the problem. About 47 percent blame the drug companies a great deal; another 31 percent blame them a moderate amount. And just 19 percent blame drug companies "not much," or "not at all." Bush, in his second debate with Kerry, said the country is looking for other sources of vaccine, but he said that is difficult because vaccine makers are afraid of getting sued and had "backed off" from providing vaccines. Some Americans say they agree. About 18 percent blame trial lawyers a great deal and 23 percent blame them a moderate amount. About 53 percent don't really blame the lawyers. The poll had 1,538 adult respondents, with a sampling error of three percentage points.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

German bishops' 'shame' over abuse scandal By The CNN Wire Staff Pope Benedict XVI has expressed his dismay at allegations of abuse within the church. STORY HIGHLIGHTSArchdiocese of Munich and Freising was once headed by Pope Benedict XVIBishops express "shock and shame" at recent abuse allegations in archdioceseLawyers representing alleged victims say there are more than 300 cases across Germany Bad Staffelstein, Germany (CNN) -- German Catholic bishops in the pope's home state of Bavaria expressed "deep shock and shame" Thursday at recent reports of abuse in their diocese. In a statement issued at the spring conference of the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising, the bishops announced new measures to win back trust and prevent similar abuse from happening in the future. The archdiocese is the same one that Pope Benedict XVI, as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, once headed. "Of the highest priority is the search for truth and the establishment of an open atmosphere that encourages the victim to express what was done to them," the bishops said in a statement. It comes after hundreds of alleged victims have come forward in Germany claiming priests abused them. Some allege the abuse was sexual, while others refer to physical violence such as slapping.

German lawyers representing alleged victims say there are more than 300 cases across Germany. Some of the cases date back to the 1950s. The bishops pledged to work closely with both victims and law enforcement, and they also said they are open to financial compensation. "The bishops want to grant help to the individual victims beyond what is legally required of the perpetrators," the statement said. They pledged to follow up on every case and suspicion involving abuse. They also said they would ask the public prosecutor to recommend steps to take and to implement those steps immediately. "It is urgent for the bishops to do everything possible in their power to prevent abuse and violence," they said. Meanwhile, the head of the Irish Catholic Church, Cardinal Sean Brady, admitted Wednesday that the church's response to abuse in his country had been "hopelessly inadequate." Irish cardinal sorry for child abuse failures The deeply Catholic country has been badly shaken by a government-backed report that found the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Catholic Church authorities in Ireland covered up child abuse by priests from 1975 to 2004. Child sexual abuse was widespread then, the report found. The pope said Wednesday that he has finished writing an official statement, or pastoral letter, about the child abuse scandal facing the Catholic Church in Ireland.CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.

Taliban attack wounds teen activist blogger
By Shaan Khan, CNN
updated 4:38 AM EDT, Wed October 10, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Doctors remove a bullet lodged in her neck Pakistan's prime minister condemns the attack, speaks with teen's father
Pakistani Taliban claim they targeted the teen blogger
She feared being beheaded because of her passion for education
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Malala Yousufzai's courageous blogging against the Taliban set her apart from other 14-year-old Pakistani girls.
Growing up in a region once dominated by the Islamic extremists, she knew the fear associated with the word Taliban.
One of her fears came to pass Tuesday, when gunmen sought her out and opened fire on her school van, leaving her seriously wounded along with two other classmates.

The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, Taliban spokesman Ihsnaullah Ishan told CNN. Ishan blamed the shooting on Malala's activist blogging.
Doctors removed a bullet lodged in her neck during three hours of surgery on Wednesday morning.
"Inshallah (God willing), she will survive," said Dr. Mumtaz Ali, a neurosurgeon who worked Malala with three colleagues.
The attack began when armed militants stopped a van as it was taking her and two other girls home from school. The attackers asked which girl was Malala, said Kainat Bibi, one of the wounded girls. When the girls pointed Malala out, the men opened fire, Bibi said, wounding the girls before the van's driver was able to speed away. The other two girls' injuries were not considered life-threatening.

Malala lives in northwest Pakistan's Swat Valley -- one of the nation's most conservative regions. Her frustration with the Taliban's restrictions on female education in her town prompted her to use the Internet and speak out, effectively making herself a target.
She reached out to the outside world online, taking a stand by writing about her daily battle with extremist militants who used fear and intimidation to force girls to stay at home.
"I had a terrible dream yesterday with military helicopters and the Taliban," she wrote in January 2009. "I have had such dreams since the launch of the military operation in Swat. My mother made me breakfast and I went off to school. I was afraid going to school because the Taliban had issued an edict banning all girls from attending schools."
Opinion: Girl's courage, Taliban's cowardice
Malala's shooting has sparked national outrage -- forcing Pakistanis to take a harsh look at how extremist elements are shaping the nation. "Our society is going through a very critical phase," said Aazadi Fateh Muhammad, a professor of mass communications at Federal Urdu University Karachi, in an e-mail to CNN. "Civil society and civilians are in a war with militants and terrorists in every part of the region."
The attack on Malala, Muhammad said, is an example of this war. "Dark hands," she said, tried to attack Malala's cause, "but it will discourage many others who are fighting for light."
The Taliban controlled Malala's valley for years until 2009, when the military cleared it in an operation that also evacuated thousands of families.
Attack on teen blogger consumes Pakistan
Last year, Malala told CNN she feared "being beheaded by the Taliban because of my passion for education. During their rule, the Taliban used to march into our houses to check whether we were studying or watching television."
She described how she used to hide her books under her bed, fearing a house search by the Taliban.
Malala's online writing against the Taliban led to her being awarded Pakistan's first National Peace Prize last November. Former Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani directed Pakistan's Cabinet to award the prize each year to a child under 18 who contributes to peace and education.
President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the attack, which prompted outrage among residents on local media sites. Also condemning the attack was Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf, who spoke with Malala's father on the phone Tuesday, according to a statement from the prime minister's office.

Clinton's future 'as good as her past,' docs say

Anyone who has had a blood clot in the past is at a higher risk of getting one again
It's unknown if Clinton has a genetic condition that may increase her risk
(CNN) -- Doctors say Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is on her way to a full recovery after a blood clot was found in her head on Sunday night.
She was discharged from New York Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday after spending three days being treated, the State Department announced.
Clinton's blood clot was located in the vein between the brain and skull behind her right ear, according to her doctors' statement. It is being treated with blood thinners and did not result in a stroke or any neurological damage.
This type of blood clot is called a cerebral vein thrombosis and is relatively rare, said Dr. Mary Cushman, director of the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Program at the University of Vermont and chair of the American Society of Hematology's subcommittee on quality of care.

Photos: Clinton's political career
A two-year study conducted in the Netherlands found cerebral vein thrombosis affects approximately 1 in every 100,000 people. In comparison, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 1 in 1,000 people are affected by deep venous thrombosis (DVT) -- a similar clot found most often in the leg.
Clinton, now 65, suffered from a DVT in 1998. Anyone who has had a blood clot in the past is at a higher risk of getting one again. About one-third of people with DVT will have a recurrence within 10 years, according to the CDC.
"There are a handful of genetic conditions that predispose someone to these kinds of clots," Cushman said. "That's why you might see two different (types of blood clots) in the same person."
It's unknown if Clinton has a genetic condition that may increase her risk. Other risk factors for DVT include smoking, use of oral contraceptives, age (the risk increases over age 65) and obesity.
Clinton's blood clot and her future
Hillary Clinton's blood clot explained
Clinton treated for blood clot in head
Blood clots: 4 things you need to know A large long-term study published in the journal PLoS One in 2007 found the more frequently a person travels, the higher their risk of blood clots.
The blood in veins is fighting gravity to get back to the heart, Cushman said, and needs the leg muscles to help push it along. When a person is sedentary for long periods of time -- especially on a plane or in a car where the legs are in the same position for hours -- the blood can start to clot.
Clinton has logged many miles as secretary of state, in addition to the time spent traveling as a former presidential candidate and first lady. Although she plans to step down from the State Department soon, there is a lot of speculation about a run for president in 2016.
Blood clots wouldn't deter her from campaigning if that's what she chooses, said Dr. Jack Ansell, an expert in thrombosis at Lenox Hill Hospital who is not involved in Clinton's care.
"Travel is potentially an issue for the secretary, but I would imagine that when she travels she's not sitting in a coach seat, cramped up and sitting still," Ansell said.
Experts recommend anyone with a history of blood clots stand up and walk every couple hours during long trips. They should also avoid alcoholic drinks prior to traveling -- dehydration can contribute to the formation of blood clots. Doctors often recommend wearing compression stockings, which help move blood along in the legs by narrowing the veins.
Clinton may remain on blood thinners for several months or for the foreseeable future, said Dr. Evan Lipsitz, chief of vascular surgery at Montefiore Medical Center, who is not treating the secretary of state.
"The current recommendations are for at least three months of treatment with a blood thinner following a clot. Each case much be individualized depending on the size and location of the clot and the risk of bleeding as a result of the treatment," Lipsitz said.
Often patients on these medications are monitored closely, having their blood checked once a month or every couple of months to ensure the dosage is right.
Lipsitz makes his patients aware of typical blood clot symptoms (sudden pain or swelling in the limbs, or chest pain and shortness of breath caused by a blood clot traveling toward the lungs) so they can spot them and get treated quickly.
Patients on blood thinners need to avoid physical trauma, Cushman said, but are otherwise fine. So while an NFL player or a construction worker would probably be out, Clinton's career going forward is still full of possibilities.
"I think her future is as good as her past," Ansell said. "She should recover fully and get back to work."

Economy class goes gourmet
By Daisy Carrington, for CNN
updated 1:34 PM EST, Tue February 5, 2013
U.S. Airways was the first U.S. carrier to introduce premium, pre-ordered meals. The airline has sold 5,000 meals since launching the DineFresh program in August.
Air Berlin launched an in-flight, a la carte menu back in 2006. To give their food a sense of cache, they teamed with popular German restaurant Sansibar.
KLM says the decision to offer gourmet, pre-order meals was a result of customer demand, and not an attempt to bring in more ancilary revenue.
Hawaiian Airlines has teamed up with local producers to create a snack menu that evokes the spirit of Hawaii. Austrian Airlines passengers can upgrade their in-flight meal by pre-ordering from a kiosk at Vienna Airport one hour before takeoff.
Airline managers at an aviation conference could not distinguish between Delta premium economy food and first-class fare.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Airlines are giving economy customers the option to upgrade their meal
The quality of these premium meals tries to mimic first-class fare
Many carriers are teaming with high-profile restaurants to create more exciting menus
Logistics means only a handful of routes offer upgraded fare
(CNN) -- In-flight meals don't have a stellar reputation but a handful of airlines are bringing first class food to those stuck in economy class.
Airlines across Europe and the U.S. are now offering economy passengers the chance to upgrade their meals, ordering ahead of their flight, and choosing from menus more readily found in cabins at the front of the plane.
"The craze started last year, and since then, every airline has jumped on the bandwagon to have a pre-order program," notes Nikos Loukas, an airline catering consultant, and founder of inflightfeed.com.
2012: 85 years of airline meals
AirBerlin was the first carrier to launch an a la carte service for economy customers, teaming with upscale German restaurant Sansibar. The onboard menu includes a favorite from the restaurant's own: a veal and pork currywurst.
Right now, by only operating out of two hubs, it's easy to control the consistency of the productRuss Brown
Adding some local flavor is just one way make an airline's in-flight experience stand out.
Blaine Miyasato, Hawaiian Airline's vice president of product development, has joined with local businesses to source items that evoke the spirit of Hawaii -- from wasabi ranch popcorn to toffee covered macadamia nuts.
"We wanted to showcase the products that promote the ambiance that makes Hawaii so special," he explained.
Statistics are showing that passengers are willing to pay a little extra for better food.
Austrian Airways sells roughly 600,000 pre-ordered meals a year, while U.S. Airways, which in August became the first American carrier to launch premium dining in economy class, estimates it has sold over 5,000 units from its DineFresh menu.

I'm a big believer that food can make or break a flightNikos Loukas
"We realized we had a premium customer sitting in economy class who would appreciate and purchase an on board culinary experience," notes Russ Brown, U.S. Airways' director of product planning and development.
"We tried to use an upscale bento box as a footprint," says Brown. "We designed it so that when the product is delivered to the customer, it looks and feels like a present."
Nearly every carrier that offers the service only does so on flights that leave from their home hub.
"When you expand to different countries, you have to first do a menu design workshop, to help make sure you have all the components and produce in place," explains Brown.
Currently, U.S. Airways sells DineFresh meals only on flights leaving from Philadelphia and Charlotte, though they are planning to expand the program in the future.
"Right now, by only operating out of two hubs, it's easy to control the consistency of the product," he adds.

Because the meals are customized, passengers are required to order anywhere from 24 to 48 hours in advance, though that may also change in the future. Austrian Airlines allows passengers leaving from Vienna to order meals one hour prior to departure from a special kiosk at the airport.
KLM introduced a la carte offerings on select flights last November. The move, says the airline, was prompted more by customer demand than the prospect of generating extra revenue.
"Our main goal was to offer passengers more choice. As handling and logistics are more complex with a la carte, additional costs are made by KLM," says Jane Jong-Baw, a spokeswoman for the airline.
Given the cost and the bother for airlines, one wonders what's really in it for them.
Loukas points out that better in-flight meals help build brand loyalty.
"I'm a big believer that food can make or break a flight," he says.

Twitter says goodbye to the pope, with a laugh
Join the conversation CNN iReport
By Dorrine Mendoza, CNN
updated 6:14 AM EST, Fri March 1, 2013 | Filed under: Social Media
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Pope officially retires Thursday as Vatican deletes his Twitter history
Twitter users were uncommonly silent until the retirement was official
@pontifex account gains 500 new followers after deleting tweets (CNN) -- For the first time in nearly 600 years, a reigning pope has resigned. And in what might also be a landmark event, Twitter was not flooded with jokes or parody accounts when the announcement was made two weeks ago.
On February 11 @davewiner tweeted, "Perfect storm for Pope jokes. Since he's not dead no one can complain 'You're being insensitive.'"
But in the days that followed, not much surfaced. It was so odd that tweets like this were more common: "Did I miss the memo about no Pope jokes?" tweeted @NouveauBroke.
Although a parody account, @RetiredPopeXVI, did appear, it only has 577 followers and sent out a paltry five tweets.
2012: The pope joins Twitter
That all changed on Thursday when Pope Benedict XVI slipped off his red loafers and officially became pope emeritus. Curiously, the Vatican also deleted all 39 of his tweets from the official @pontifex Twitter account. (They are archived here.)
And slowly, the jokes began to surface. Here are a handful we found humorous.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Vote on which of these stories you like best and CNN will cover the top five
The vote is part of a new project called Change the List, led by John Sutter
Sutter: Change the List aims to bring attention to places that need it most
Malaria, polio, women's rights, Internet access and free speech all are on the list
Editor's note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion. VOTE on what he will cover as part of the Change the List project. The ballot works best on desktop computers and tablets. Follow him on Twitter, Facebook or Google+. E-mail him: ctl@cnn.com.
(CNN) -- We journalists tend to think of ourselves as public servants, but we sure don't act like it all the time. The institution has one foot firmly planted in elitism: Editors know what you need to know before you know you need to know it. It would be foolish to think that -- gasp! -- the public could help decide what matters.
But things don't have to be that way, right?
We're better people when we work together.
It's in a spirit of democracy and inclusion that I'm asking you to vote on the stories I should cover over the course of the next 12 months for a new CNN project called Change the List. It's not that I don't have ideas about what I'd like to do, or that the views of professional journalists don't matter. They do. It's that I also trust your judgment and I want to write about issues you find important.
Vote here: You pick it, CNN covers it
I also want you to participate in every part of the storytelling.
John D. Sutter
With help from lots of smart people, I've selected 20 story ideas I think are worthy of your attention. Each highlights an extreme case: The country with the least access to toilets; the state with the highest incarceration rate; the nation where malaria is deadliest; the place where 1 in 100 live births kills the mother; the country where the largest number of new leprosy cases is diagnosed each year; the one country that ranks below North Korea on free speech.
The goal, as the name Change the List suggests, is to start a conversation that could -- just maybe, and over time -- bump these places off the bottom of the list.
It's a project that supports the world's underdogs. The aim isn't to shame the places at the bottom of the list; it's to give them a megaphone and support.
Go to the Change the List homepage -- http://cnn.com/changethelist -- to pick your top five stories from the list of 20 before voting closes on Monday, June 17.
Think of this as your chance to be a CNN assignment editor. You're my boss, in fact. (Dear people who pay me: Please keep doing that?) And as my new (and hopefully benevolent) Internet-based overlord, you have every right to tell me these 20 ideas are junk. Instead of firing me, I'd ask that you send me an e-mail (ctl@cnn.com) or a note on Twitter (@jdsutter) with an idea for a story you think is more important or interesting. We're going to include a sixth wild-card choice in the coverage plan -- and, while CNN's editors will have the final say, that idea could come from you.
Since I hope you'll take me on as an employee, I should probably tell you a little bit about myself. I've been at CNN for more than four years now, covering all sorts of topics, from video gaming in South Korea to prisons in Norway and slavery in Mauritania. If there's one thing this place has taught me it's that stories are more powerful, memorable and meaningful when you participate in them.
I saw this last month when strangers on Twitter helped me navigate a somewhat treacherous walk through the 17-mile path of an Oklahoma tornado. I wasn't alone on that two-day trek. I was on a journey with dozens of new friends.
"@jdsutter maybe I should tweet you a picture of the bottom of my foot as an example of why tetanus shots are important?"
And I saw it after dozens of CNN iReporters sent in "messages of hope" to former and escaped slaves in Mauritania, which I visited in 2011. Support videos came from all over: from Saudi Arabia to South Korea, California to Kentucky.
"I want you to know that all of us are so proud of you ...," one woman said to the group of former slaves, who were taking classes in Mauritania's capital.
And I saw it last year when a videographer, Edythe McNamee, and I did the pilot for Change the List. We featured Hawaii, the U.S. state with the lowest voter turnout rate. Less than half of Hawaii's residents voted in the 2008 presidential election.
We weren't able to change that in one month, of course, but we did get people talking. Hawaii tied West Virginia for 49th place in voter turnout in the November 2012 election. And, more meaningfully for me, three of the six nonvoters we featured as part of a story called "Convince me to vote!" ended up voting because of messages CNN's readers sent to them via social media.
"I feel good about it," one man said of his decision to vote for the first time.
It's journalism with an agenda. I'm not ashamed of that.
The main agenda is for your voice to be heard -- and for us to work together to amplify the voices of people that aren't often heard in the news.
And it starts with a vote. So tell me, boss. What should we cover?

Pilot concerned about landing Asiana jet before crash
By Mike M. Ahlers, CNN
updated 9:46 PM EST, Wed December 11, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Pilot noted that airport navigation system wasn't working
NEW: Comments from pilots revealed by crash investigators at hearing
Trainee pilot was flying the Boeing 777 with an instructor beside him
Investigators focus on concern that pilot relied too much on automated systems
Washington (CNN) -- The pilot of an Asiana Airlines jet that crashed in San Francisco this year told investigators after the accident that he had been "very concerned" about landing without help from an airport navigation system that was out of order.
Capt. Lee Kang Kuk, who was highly experienced in a Boeing 747 but was transitioning to flying a 777, told the National Transportation Safety Board that he found it "very stressful, very difficult" to land without the glideslope indicator that helps pilots determine whether the plane is too high or too low during approach.
"Asked whether he was concerned about his ability to perform the visual approach while piloting Asiana Flight 214, he said 'very concerned, yea,'" the safety board revealed at a hearing on Wednesday on its investigation into the July 6 crash that killed three people and injured more than 180 others.
The jet struck a sea wall and broke apart on the runway following a missed approach.

Plane crash-lands in San Francisco New video released of Asiana plane crash
Video shows plane's moment of impact
The navigation aid that syncs up with aircraft instruments was out of service while the Federal Aviation Administration made runway safety improvements. But a second, visual lighting system was operable at the time of the daytime crash and the weather was clear.
The safety board investigation is focusing on whether pilots have become overly reliant on automation to fly commercial planes, and whether basic manual flying skills have eroded.
Investigators have also focused on the pilot understanding -- or misunderstanding -- of the plane's auto-thrust system, which controls aircraft power.
Automated cockpit systems key to Asiana probe
Some of the crew of the Asiana flight from Seoul told investigators the auto thrust was always engaged.
But the safety board has said that system was not engaged, and the jet descended in altitude faster than it should have, and had a slower forward speed than intended.
The combination put the plane into a perilous situation in the final minute of flight.
The relief first officer, Bong Dongwon, who was sitting behind Lee and instructor pilot Lee Jungmin, said he observed the fast descent -- or sink rate -- and called out the excessive sink rate "more than four times."
Bong told investigators the pilot appeared to be correcting the "sink rate" and did not advise further changes.
But its speed was declining at about the same time. The plane was flying at 170 knots 73 seconds before impact, dropped below the target speed for landing of 137 knots at roughly 38 seconds before impact, and plummeted as low as 103 knots just seconds before the plane's front landing gear and tail hit the sea wall at the end of the runway.
Will firefighter be charged after Asiana crash?
The crew made its first reference to the plane's speed problem just seven seconds before the crash.
The pilot called out a "go around" -- a command to abort the landing -- three seconds before impact.
Boeing's former chief pilot for the B777 program said automated systems are intended to help pilots, but that they still need to exercise diligence.
"We accept the fact that pilots, as all humans, make errors," he said. Automation is intended "as a tool to aid the pilot, not replace the pilot," he said.
Information released at Wednesday's hearing also showed investigators are concerned about the role Korean and airline culture played in the crash.
Bong said the crew practiced "cockpit resource management," training that encourages subordinates to speak up about safety concerns to other crew members, despite their senior rank, experience or seniority.
But when Lee -- who was considered a student pilot in the 777 -- was asked whether he had contemplated an aborted landing as the plane descended, he said it was a "very hard" decision to make, given the deference shown to superiors in Korean culture.
By the time Lee pushed the throttle forward just seconds before impact, he discovered his instructor had already done so.
Three passengers died in the accident -- two in the crash and a third on the ground when hit by a rescue truck responding to the scene.
The accident was the first fatal commercial airline crash in the United States since February 2009.
Crash survivor Ben Levy told CNN he was forfeiting an opportunity to watch the proceedings.
"I think something that I've done quickly after this plane crash has been to focus on work and family and things that matter to me," Levy said. "I'm extremely happy that something is being done to get to the bottom of what happened that day because it should not have happened."
Opinion: Pilots, not computers, should fly planes

From pacemakers to braces, the medical benefits of space exploration
Quick blood pressure recorders are one of the widely-used devices created by the U.S. space program
From Medical Correspondent Dan Rutz
November 2, 1998
Web posted at: 4:53 p.m. EST (2153 GMT)
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- What do you think blast-off does to your blood pressure? When Alan Shepard became the first American to fly in space 37 years ago, Project Mercury scientists had to invent an automatic measuring device to find out.
Today, you can find the device in just about any drugstore for an instant check-up. It is just one of an ever-growing number of medical spin-offs from space.
Scratch-resistant lenses for eyeglasses are straight from the stars. NASA needed something to protect satellites from getting nicked by space debris.
Speaking of satellites, how do they spring open after being cramped into a rocket for the ride up? The key is nitinol, a medical alloy with an almost magical ability to spring back into shape from the tightest contortion.
Nitinol makes wearing dental braces just a little easier.
"It allows me to engage every tooth in the mouth pretty easily," said Atlanta orthodontist Moody Williams. "Put it in and it works for a very long time. It never loses its activity."
NASA's chief historian, Roger Launius, said great ideas from America's greatest adventure are a bonus.
"The spinoffs are essentially serendipity," he said. "The primary mission of the agency is to fly in space."

In the early years of the space program, little was said about applied science or medical spinoffs. In those days, NASA got its clout from the space race with the Soviet Union.
"In that sense, it was a cold war agency," Launius said. "It emerged as a direct aftermath of Sputnik."
After the moon walk, in the 1970s, NASA started to make more of the medical achievements it helped foster.
Neurosurgeon Richard North of Johns Hopkins Medical School was a student then, collaborating with space physicists and medical engineers.
"They had this expression -- 'Launch it,' -- as a point of time at which one would have to rely on remote programming and interrogation to control this device."
Both a satellite sent into space and an electronic pain-control device implanted in a patient are out of reach and adjustable only by telemetry born of the space program.
Rabbi Sholem Kowalsky's pacemaker has technology similar to that used to operate satellites orbiting the earth
With less effort than it takes to change channels, a patient with the electronic pain-control device can find relief thanks to miniature electronic components inside the body.
Heart pacemakers work through electronic monitoring similar to that used to operate satellites orbiting the earth.
"We thought going to the moon or going to the heavens, but what will it do for me?" Rabbi Sholem Kowlasky, one pacemaker patient said. "Most people did not know, especially the laymen."
Sam Zaccari, 56, a volunteer at John Hopkins Diabetes Center, has also come to appreciate the medical spinoffs from space. The implantable insulin pump that has kept his diabetes under control since 1986 borrows from the mechanical robot arm on the first Mars Voyager probe.
"It's wonderful because without this technology that we got today I wouldn't have the control I have and maybe I might not be here," he said.
