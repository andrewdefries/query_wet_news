Famously (and famous) bad bossesStory Highlights One high-profile film producer has fired hundreds of personal assistants Naomi Campbell's treatment of her employees has landed her in court And would you really want to answer to Simon Cowell or Al Capone? Next Article in Living » By Mary Lorenz Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com.
You may think you have the worst boss in the Western Hemisphere, but if you've never had to dodge a cell phone, been fired over a breakfast pastry or had your work referred to as "a complete and utter mess," you probably have it better than you realize. Consider the following celebrities, whose poor underlings withstood verbal and sometimes physical abuse and lived to tell about it: Scott Rudin The high-profile film producer, whose film credits include "The Queen," "The Royal Tenenbaums" and "The Firm," is infamous for his hot temper and verbal rants. The Wall Street Journal once claimed he has fired 250 personal assistants, sometimes for offenses as minor as bringing him the wrong breakfast muffin. (Rudin claimed the actual number is closer to 120; however, he wasn't counting those who didn't survive his grueling two-week trial period.) Despite Rudin's reputation, however, being his personal assistant remains one of the most coveted jobs among wannabe movie moguls. Naomi Campbell Campbell is to her employees what fireworks are to the average person: If not handled carefully, she may cause bodily harm. In early 2007, the British supermodel pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault for hitting her housekeeper with a cell phone over a pair of missing jeans. Campbell insisted the incident was an accident, but a history of similar events -- including a 2000 guilty plea for assaulting a personal assistant on a movie set in 1998 -- indicates otherwise. Simon Cowell It's no secret that the mastermind behind "American Idol" has notoriously high standards, nor does he apologize for them. In fact, Cowell, who is known for finding new and creative ways to insult everyone from contestants to "Idol" host Ryan Seacrest, seems to relish his reputation as the judge everyone loves to hate. And why not? After all, it is his famously prickly personality that has helped make him a household name. Al Capone Alphonse "Al" Capone's name is synonymous with organized crime. He was as well-known for his involvement in illegal gambling, bootlegging and prostitution as for his brutality. His own men were behind 1929's infamous "St. Valentine's Day Massacre." In 1931, Capone finally went to prison for income tax evasion and was released -- ironically, for good behavior -- after serving eight years in federal prisons. Afterward, Capone retired to his estate in Florida, where he died in 1947 of heart failure. Leona Helmsley The recently-deceased Manhattan hotelier will go down in history as the "Queen of Mean," a nickname she earned as a result of her erratic behavior and hasty firing of employees. After serving time for tax evasion in 1989 ("Only the little people pay taxes," was her infamous defense), Helmsley again brushed with the law in 2004 when a court ordered her to pay a former landscaper for breach of contract (Helmsley had abruptly fired the man after finding out he was gay). Gordon Ramsay The hot-tempered (pun intended) host of "Hell's Kitchen" could give Simon Cowell a run for his money as the cruelest judge on TV. Neither holds back when it comes to doling out criticism, but Ramsay steps it up a notch with slightly more colorful language. In fact, his fondness for four-letter words is matched only by Cowell's fondness for tight black T-shirts. E-mail to a friend Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

Opinion: Rejecting nuclear power would be 'sheer folly'By Malcolm Grimston, for CNN Future energy source: Malcolm Grimston makes the case for nuclear power. STORY HIGHLIGHTSProblems with nuclear power are "minor compared to energy shortages and climate change" Nuclear power can provide reliable baseload energy that renewables currently cannot More renewable energy needed but only if it is "technically feasible"Malcolm Grimston is an associate fellow at Chatham House, a UK-based NGO analyzing international affairs and issues. Here he gives the case for nuclear energy. London, England (CNN) -- We need three things from global energy and electricity supplies. They should be as economic as possible, as reliable as possible -- power cuts are very expensive -- and do as little damage to the environment as possible. The challenge for energy policy, of course, is that often these three requirements pull us in different directions. The 1990s (especially in the UK) was extremely unusual in that a single policy -- the "dash for gas" -- was delivering on the economic, security and environmental fronts. Gas was cheap and plentiful and a lot of new generating capacity was built. Now, however, the world is in trouble on all three fronts. Oil is hovering at around $80 a barrel dragging gas, coal and electricity prices up with it. Security of supply is threatened in two ways. The main gas (and oil) reserves are in the Middle East and countries of the former Soviet Union -- not necessarily the most reliable suppliers for the long term. Many countries are also becoming alarmingly short of electricity generating capacity. Meanwhile, despite growing fears of climate change the world is using a lot more energy and getting more of it from the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions -- oil, gas and coal -- than it did at the time of the supposedly groundbreaking Rio Conference in 1992. As countries like China and India develop their economies world energy use is expected to double by 2050. Yet we have to cut releases of "greenhouse gases" like carbon dioxide by perhaps four-fifths over the same period if we are to stand a chance of managing the consequences. 'New' renewables make very little contribution. Nuclear (and hydro) are proven low-carbon energy sources.--Malcolm Grimston

It's impossible to believe there is a single simple solution to all of this. We need to use energy as efficiently as possible. We need to look for ways of capturing the carbon dioxide from coal and gas-fired power stations. We also need to use more renewables where they are technically feasible. So why nuclear? Its economics are probably favorable against any realistic assumption about fossil fuel prices in the future. It does depend on the industry being able to deliver new stations to time and cost -- the experience in Finland and France, where the world's first nuclear reactors of the design known as the EPR are being built, is typical of the first-of-a-kind of any major technology, running seriously late and at much higher cost than first claimed, but that does not imply that future plants will follow the same pattern, assuming a sensible regulatory regime can be established. But that of course is a matter for the commercial companies that will consider building them. The fuel, uranium, is widespread -- countries like Canada and Australia are major producers. Unlike renewables, it does not depend on the wind blowing at the right speed, or the tide being in or the sun being out. Indeed, for "baseload" -- the reliable electricity that we need for transportation, pumping water, keeping us warm (or cool) and so on -- nuclear energy does not compete with renewables but with coal and gas. And nuclear energy doesn't add to serious releases of carbon dioxide. What do you think? Is nuclear power a good option? Send your comments using the "Sound off" box at the bottom of the page. Is it perfect? No. Are its problems (notably radioactive waste) minor compared to energy shortages and climate change? In my view, resoundingly yes. Nuclear energy should either be included in mechanisms for supporting low-carbon energy, such as the European renewables targets, or such measures should be abolished. Only then would decisions on how most efficiently we can cut carbon emissions be taken on rational grounds rather than in deference to the hobby-horses of pressure groups. Latest polls suggest that only 26 percent of people in the UK are convinced that climate change is real and caused by human activity. Yet some self-styled environmentalists would rather divert their campaigning efforts to attack nuclear energy, which in reality has been very environmentally benign over the last 55 years when the "what-ifs" are ignored, than to establishing a public basis for action against what is in reality the greatest environmental threat we have ever faced or are likely to face. It is a warped sense of priorities of the most irresponsible kind. At present we get about seven eighths of the world's traded energy from oil, coal and gas. The rest is almost evenly divided between nuclear and hydro. "New" renewables make very little contribution. According to some commentators, mankind perversely chose to use all the bad sources of energy first, and kept the nice easy ones till last. It might be true but it almost certainly isn't. Nuclear (and hydro) are proven non-fossil low-carbon energy sources. To turn our backs on them now is sheer folly. Coming soon: The case against nuclear energy.

Royal style: Why Elizabeth II is the queen of color By Lauren Said-Moorhouse for CNN
updated 7:59 PM EDT, Tue June 12, 2012
Bright, bold and beautiful -- the Queen has never shied away from strong colors and daring hats.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Famed for her unique hats and bold colors, the queen has a trademark fashion style
For years her clothes were made by British designer Hardy Amies, now couturier Stewart Parvin makes her eye-catching outfits
Designers are given royal warrants to become dressers to the queen and it is no easy feat getting one
London, England (CNN) -- Her outfits don't send royal fashion watchers into a frenzy like those of the Duchess of Cambridge or Princess Diana before her, but Queen Elizabeth II has developed a signature style that has withstood the test of time.
Her attire over the last 60 years has reflected the sovereign as a British symbol of refined, regal elegance. The looks she has worn have steadily evolved into her trademark -- monochromatic color with matching coat and hat.
Not one to wear sombre, muted hues like black or beige, the queen has always had a preference for vivid blues, intense greens and dazzling purples in a variety of dramatic shades.
Over the past six decades, Her Majesty has employed the talents of several British designers.

What to expect on Jubilee's final day
One of her first designers was Norman Hartnell, who worked for her in the 1940s and created many of the full-skirted evening silk dresses she wore to various events as a glamorous young princess.
Britain rocks out for queen's jubilee
As a newly crowned queen in the early 1950s, she chose Savile Row tailor Hardy Amies to create elegant evening gowns for her waspish 23-inch (58cm) waist. He was granted the coveted Royal Warrant in 1955. Amies once famously declared: "I do not dress the queen. The queen dresses herself. We supply her with her clothes -- there is a difference."
The Queen's Diamond Jubilee picnic
Two decades later the queen chose a young designer, Ian Thomas, to soften her look with "flowing chiffon dresses," according to the British Monarchy website.
Queen marks diamond jubilee Couture designer Karl-Ludwig Rehse started making outfits for Her Majesty in 1988 and the queen still wears his designs. He also dressed the late Queen Mother and describes the queen's clothes as a work uniform.
He told CNN: "They have to be comfortable in as much as when the queen puts on the clothes she wants to forget about them.
"You have to take into account the different countries and the different climates in which they'll be worn. The queen always makes sure that she follows the tradition."
While most people would be hard pressed to imagine what they will be wearing the next day, the queen's wardrobe is planned out months in advance, says Rehse.
"It's not the case that the queen is going somewhere next week and thinks 'What am I going to wear?' Sometimes it is six months, 12 months or longer."

A very VIP patron
One person who is currently in the queen's fashion inner circle is couturier and wedding dress designer Stewart Parvin. He first started making royal outfits in 2000 and recalls the secretive selection process that took place before he started working for the queen.
She has a very informed opinion and she knows when it's right and she knows when it's wrong.Stewart Parvin, royal designer
"At first I wasn't told who it was for," Parvin told CNN.
"It was, 'Could you design for someone who is a really prominent person in the public eye and wants a very chic image?' I thought it was going to be a politician or a tycoon's wife. I put together a packet of sketches but it wasn't until they were chosen I knew who they were for."
"She is someone who is very interested in her clothes. She always has an opinion on it and she has a very informed opinion and she knows when it's right and she knows when it's wrong," said Parvin, who designs two couture collections a year and was in 2007 awarded the Royal Warrant -- given to designers who have worked with the queen for five years or more.
An ensemble fit for a queen
Both Parvin and Rehse told CNN the queen is very involved in the design process, culminating with fittings at Buckingham Palace.

"Sometimes I choose the fabric and then propose ideas for them, as I would do for any client," said Parvin. "I put together a scheme, maybe four designs for one fabric combination, then she would look at them and either choose a design straight away or suggest some changes."

Rehse says the queen asks him to come up with two or three different alternatives for a particular fabric she likes before settling on a final design.
"I do get a lot of input from the queen," said Rehse. "The pressure is there but I take great joy out of it and it's very rewarding to see Her Majesty wearing my clothes in public."
In addition to warrant-holding royal designers, Her Majesty also has a senior dresser and personal assistant, Angela Kelly.

The daughter of a Liverpool dockworker, dressmaker Kelly originally joined the royal household as a maid before working her way up to her current position. She established the first ever in-house couturier and has gone on to design outfits for some of the most enviable royal events including last year's wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton. Known to have a close relationship with the queen, it has been noted by some royal observers that Kelly has slipped into the vacancies left by the deaths of the queen's sister and mother. Kelly and her team use old and new fabrics when designing for the queen using material given to her from when she was a princess, according to the Buckingham Palace website.
The queen is very involved in the design process according to royal designers Parvin and Rehse who spoke to CNN. Parvin says: "She knows when it's right and she knows when it's wrong."GETTY IMAGES
Hats off to Her Majesty!
Milliner Philip Somerville received a royal warrant following 12 years working for the queen. Now, when the queen steps out she's usually wearing a Somerville creation.
"You have to realize that you are never sure when Her Majesty will wear (a particular hat)," he said. "It depends on the weather on many occasions. You are also creating something that has to be very wearable and must be in colors that suit her. She must be noticed in a crowd."
AFP/GETTY IMAGES
After 33 years in the business, Somerville stepped down as the queen's hatter handing the business over to Dillon Wallwork.
"I've been here for some time now and we've always had a Philip Somerville look which is very clean, understated and elegant," said Wallwork.
Creating a hat fit for a queen is not without its pressures, Wallwork says.
"You know you are under a certain pressure because of the press and what people are going to say," he said. "You know she is going to be looked at. There are certain styles that you can and can't do but within those limits there's lots that you can do. It's quite a challenge but the queen can be quite adventurous."

Sandy Hook must be a tipping point for change

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Piers Morgan: Past gun-related tragedies haven't led to any action
He says that must change, and he hosted a debate on the issue
Morgan: Laws must be changed to limit weapons, ammunition and enforce background checks
Rights of Americans who use guns for hunting and sport must be respected, he says
(CNN) -- On Wednesday night, I hosted a town hall-style debate on guns in America, talking to lawmakers, mass shooting survivors, lawyers, gun lobbyists -- anyone, basically, who has a strong opinion about what I consider to be the single biggest issue facing America today.
Since I joined CNN two years ago, there have been a series of gun-related tragedies, including the attack on U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater massacre.
Each sparked a short-term debate about guns. Yet each debate fizzled out with zero action being taken to try and curb the use of deadly weapons on the streets of America.
Piers Morgan
Now, following the grotesque slaughter of 20 innocent young children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, I sense that the mood has changed.
We have reached a crucial moment in this debate, and I intend to use my platform to continue this conversation on Wednesday night and going forward. The media have previously been quick to move on to other stories after these tragic acts of gun violence. That must change.
Opinion: Don't let this moment pass without acting on gun control
Mass shooting survivors talk gun control
Morgan, guest spar over gun control
I've made my own views clear on my show -- the senseless killing has to stop. High-powered assault rifles of the type used at Aurora and Newtown belong in the military and police, not in civilian hands. High-capacity magazines, too, should be banned. And background checks on anyone buying guns in America should be comprehensive and stringently enforced.
As President Barack Obama said, doing nothing is no longer an option.
But, at the same time, law-abiding Americans who want to protect themselves under the Second Amendment right to bear arms must be respected. As should the rights of Americans to use guns for hunting and sport.
This is a vital debate for the country. Some 12,000 people are murdered in the United States with guns every year, compared with just 35 in Britain, where there are strong gun laws.
Analysis: Guns and the law
Sandy Hook should, and must, be a tipping point for real action to bring this number down.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Britain's Prince Harry says he killed Taliban militants during tour in Afghanistan
Harry, known to comrades as Captain Wales, had served for four months in Helmand province
Harry: "We fire when we have to but we're more of a deterrent than anything else"
(CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry has acknowledged that he killed Taliban insurgents on his latest tour of duty in Afghanistan as a crew member of an Apache attack helicopter.
Harry has been serving for four months as a co-pilot gunner (CPG) in southern Helmand province -- considered a Taliban heartland -- and flew on scores of missions with the trigger to rockets, missiles and a 30mm cannon at his fingertips.
No one is saying how many insurgents Harry might have killed but toward the end of his deployment, the 28-year-old, known to his comrades as Captain Wales, shared some of his feelings about combat with reporters while on duty in the massive military base known as Camp Bastion. He said it was sometimes justified to "take a life to save a life. That's what we revolve around, I suppose."

Photos: Prince Harry through the years
Prince Harry describes Afghan deployment
Prince Harry shows distaste for media
Prince Charles: I worry about Harry
2012: Taliban threaten Prince Harry Now, yes we fire when we have to but essentially we're more of a deterrent than anything elsePrince Harry
Harry explained how the roles of Apaches and CPGs have changed since his previous deployments in 2007 and 2008. "It used to be very much: front seat, you're firing the whole time.
"Now, yes we fire when we have to but essentially we're more of a deterrent than anything else.
"Our job out here is to make sure the guys are safe on the ground and if that means shooting someone who is shooting at them, then we will do it," said the prince, third in line to the British throne.
"It's not the reason I decided to do this job. The reason to do this job was to get back out here, and carry on with a job."
Away from his helicopter, the prince mixed freely on base, eating in the canteen with everyone else and relaxing by playing video games with others in the 130-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps (AAC). With those comrades, he was just "one of the guys."
More: Harry named world's most eligible bachelor
In contrast to his privileged upbringing in palaces and an education at Eton College, the prince lived in a shared room within shipping containers converted into an accommodation block. He said he was free to stroll around the base, to visit the gym or the laundry. "It's completely normal," Harry added.
But he said he still received unwanted attention in more public places. "For me it's not that normal because I go into the cookhouse and everyone has a good old gawp, and that's one thing that I dislike about being here," he said.
Opinion: Cheeky Harry vs. dull brother William
"Because there's plenty of guys in there that have never met me, therefore look at me as Prince Harry and not as Captain Wales, which is frustrating.
"Which is probably another reason why I'd love to be out in the PBs (patrol bases), away from it all.
"But yeah, it's completely normal. It's as normal as it's going to get. I'm one of the guys. I don't get treated any differently."
His deployment meant he could step back from the public eye, although he said his father, the heir to the British throne Prince Charles, often reminded him of his position. Harry admitted he had "let himself and his family down" when he was photographed naked at a party in a Las Vegas hotel last year.
Harry on Vegas romp: 'I let my family down'
He also expressed frustration about the media. Referring to the TV producer whom he was addressing, he said: "I never wanted you guys to be out here, but there was an agreement made to invite you out on the deal that the media didn't speculate before my deployment. That's the only reason you guys are out here."
Harry appeared happier talking about his military role: building up the Afghan National Army, the ANA, so it can eventually take over.
"It's great to see the ANA taking more of a lead in things as well. And the professionalism is definitely shining through."
That's something his superiors in the army might say of the prince himself.

Twitter moves to hide porn on Vine app
By Doug Gross, CNN
updated 4:00 PM EST, Tue January 29, 2013 | Filed under: Social Media
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Naughty hashtags are no longer working on Twitter's Vine video app
Users had begun using the app's 6-second clips to post porn
On Tuesday, #porn, #sex, #nude and #naked no longer delivered results
(CNN) -- Amid concerns over adult content popping up on its new Vine video app, Twitter appeared Tuesday to have restricted how users can share sexually explicit clips.
As with Twitter, Vine users can create and search hashtags (#CNN, #news, #tech, for instance) to share posts with a wider audience or find lots of content about the same subject.
By Tuesday morning, hashtags that had worked Monday -- including searches for the terms "porn," "nude," "sex" and "naked" -- were among those that delivered no results.
That doesn't mean that pornographic content has disappeared from the Vine app. But it's no longer as easy to find, or share, huge caches of the stuff with a single click.
Vine users post porn on Twitter
Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.
Rolled out last Thursday, Vine is a mobile app that lets users create six-second video clips and share them through the app, on Twitter, or both. While Vine has already been used to post some creative videos, like virtually any Web tool that allows user-created content it has also been used for the mass display of naughty bits.
Read: 6 ways Vine's six seconds might change Twitter
The issue came to the forefront over the weekend when an explicit video appeared under the prominently displayed "Editor's Picks" section on the app's main page.
Twitter said the video appeared due to an employee's error and it was removed.
The porn issue was a public-relations stumble for Twitter and for what appears to be a quickly adopted app. Since its release, Vine has been among the most popular free apps in Apple's app store. Currently, Vine is only available on Apple mobile devices.
With its restrictions, Vine's new model appears to more closely resemble the one used on Facebook-owned Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app. Salacious hashtags also deliver no results there.
On Tuesday, there were still some workaround-style hashtags on Vine with which users were sharing adult videos. Presumably, Twitter might monitor and start deleting those as well.

Apps to download before your next trip
By Doug Cantor, Departures
updated 8:01 AM EDT, Wed June 26, 2013
Finding the right apps shouldn't add stress to travel, here are ten guaranteed to make your next trip go smoother.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
ICE keeps doctors' numbers, medical conditions and insurance information iStone comes with more than 300 phrases in 12 languages
PressReader delivers 2,000 newspapers, more than 1,200 of them in English
LocalEats culls food choices based on media reviews and diner recommendations
(Departures) -- Next to a suitcase, the most indispensable travel accessory these days is a smartphone.
Whether you embark on a business trip, a weekend getaway or an exotic overseas vacation, phone apps exist to help make virtually every element of the experience far easier and more enjoyable. Travel apps have only been so robust in the last couple of years, but it already seems hard to remember how we managed to get anywhere without them.
In some instances, though, there are almost too many choices available. Dozens of apps exist for getting around, say, Europe, and many others are at the ready to help make a packing list. Want to monitor the status of a flight? You'll need to select from a host of frustratingly similar apps first. Sifting through everything can feel more onerous than navigating the security maze at LAX.
Finding the right apps shouldn't add stress to travel, so we identified ten that are intended to aid every stage of a trip.
Postagram
Remember postcards? Postagram brings back the old snail-mail staple, but with a high-tech twist. Take a photo with your smartphone camera (or choose one from your Instagram or Facebook account), type in a short message and enter the recipients' address. A personalized postcard will appear in their actual mailbox within a few days. For iOS and Android, the app is free, postcards are 99 cents for each U.S. delivery and $1.99 for international addresses. Dcovery
Organizing pre-trip research can be a challenge. Dcovery's Place Finder browser extension pulls out the points of interest mentioned in articles and other relevant pages you find online, lets you categorize them and then adds pictures, maps and directions. Sync your phone with your computer and the app puts all the information together into a handy travel guide tailored to your specific interests. The app is $3.99 for iOS.
Departures: 25 top travel apps
GateGuru
Airports aren't exactly known as fine-dining destinations, but GateGuru helps find the hidden gems in your arrival and departure locations. Upload your itinerary and the app lists food options -- as well as shops and other services like ATMs -- along with where to find them and ratings from other fliers. The app also provides estimated wait times for security lines and last-minute deals on rental cars. The app free for iOS, Android and Windows
Scout
Lots of GPS apps offer traffic updates and voice-guided, turn-by-turn navigation to help you get to your destination. Scout, however, helps find things to do once you get there. Choose local sights and attractions from an extensive catalog on its website and then sync your selections with the app for when you arrive. It also keeps up-to-date listings of recommended concerts, sporting events and other timely entertainment options so you'll always know what's happening. The app is free for iOS and Android.
Departures: Top gadgets of 2013
ICE: In Case of Emergency
Although it is probably the last thing you want to think about while traveling, having current and correct medical information is crucial if something goes wrong on a trip. ICE keeps your doctors' phone numbers, details on specific medical conditions and insurance information all in one place, where it can be accessed even when the phone is locked. The app can also translate the stored information into ten different languages. The app is $3.99 for Android.
iStone Travel Translation
iStone has just one function -- translation -- and it performs it extremely well. The app comes equipped with a list of more than 300 useful phrases -- "How much does it cost?" or "I'd love a room on a higher floor" -- that it can say aloud in any of 12 languages. Flip through categories, such as dining or directions, to quickly find the correct expression. And if you come across a new foreign phrase, you can record it to use later. The basic version of the app is free for iOS, but full versions of languages require in-app purchases.
Departures: Travel gadets for the New Year
LocalEats
A Google search will turn up plenty of restaurants in any given destination. But to narrow your culinary quest to those frequented by in-the-know foodies, you will need LocalEats. The app culls choices from dozens of cities in the United States and abroad to the essentials, all based on media reviews and diners' recommendations. Browse by categories, such as cuisine type and price range. LocalEats will find what is best near your current location, provide directions and even let you book a taxi to get there. The app is 99 cents for iOS. PressReader
For road warriors, PressReader is the best way to keep up with the happenings at home. The app delivers 2,000 newspapers from around the world to your mobile device's screen. More than 1,200 of them are in English, making it equally easy to get news about all your destinations. The interface shows each paper's actual daily layout and lets you zoom in on a page or click headlines to view a text version. If you get tired of reading all that agate type, it also has a text-to-speech option. The monlthy subscription is $29.95 for iOS, Android, Windows iPhone and Blackberry. Each download is 99 cents.
Seat Alerts
All too often the byzantine seating systems of airlines leave travelers with no attractive options. Expertflyer.com's Seat Alerts app lets you input the type of seat you prefer or even choose specific seats. Look at a seating chart for your flight, read ratings and reviews before making a selection. The app then monitors the flight's seating availability and alerts you when the one you have an eye on becomes free -- right up until the time of departure. The app is available on iOS and Android. It is free for a single alert and 99 cents for additional alerts. It costs $4.99 with an Expertflyer.com account and includes up to 30 alerts.
Travel App Box
You could download a dozen similar apps and still not match the functionality that Travel App Box offers. Billed as the Swiss Army knife of travel apps, it is a flight tracker, currency converter, tip calculator and many other useful tools rolled into one package. It also features offline maps -- including public transportation layouts in 40 cities worldwide -- for when you are stuck somewhere without cellular or WiFi service. The app is $1.99 for iOS.

Opinion: U.S. VP Joe Biden flies into diplomatic turbulence in Asia
By Andrew Hammond, former geopolitical analyst at Oxford Analytica
updated 8:27 AM EST, Mon December 2, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
China raised tensions in region by imposing a new air defense zone
Andrew Hammond says it will add to a tide of suspicion as China asserts its growing power
He says China's soft power is lagging behind it hard power, built on military might
Hammond suggests ways China could improve its engagement and image with the international community
Editor's note: Andrew Hammond was formerly a geopolitical analyst at Oxford Analytica. He was also a special adviser in the UK Government of Tony Blair. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Hammond.
(CNN) -- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden arrives in Tokyo on Monday on the first leg of a major week long trip to Asia. Biden lands at a time of significant regional tension following Beijing's announcement last week of a new "air defense identification zone" situated between China and Japan.
Since the declaration of the air zone, China has insisted that all aircraft must submit flight plans before entering. The United States has urged calm, and this will be a theme which Biden will emphasize during his visit.
The zone includes airspace over islands, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, which both countries claim as their own. The dispute over these territories is not new, but has become more salient since the Japanese government decided to nationalize them last year.
Andrew Hammond
Since last week, Washington has recommended that U.S. commercial aircraft report their flight plans to Beijing, although U.S. military aircraft continue to operate without notification. Meanwhile, Japan (which also continues to operate flights in the zone) announced on Saturday that it has asked the UN organization that oversees civil aviation to examine whether the zone could undermine aviation safety.
READ: U.S. airlines to comply with China's air zone demand
Tokyo's ambition here is to bring enhanced international scrutiny to this issue in a bid to undercut Beijing. While air zones of this nature are commonplace across the world -- Japan declared its own exclusion zone, which partially overlaps China's, in the late 1960s -- there is concern that China has both imposed this measure unilaterally and warned that it will take unspecified "emergency defensive measures" if aircraft do not comply with submitting flight plans (already, it has frayed some nerves by sending fighter jets to investigate U.S. and Japanese aircraft in the zone).
READ: China sends fighter jets into disputed air zone
Whatever Beijing's motives in declaring the zone, it will add to the growing international tide of suspicion and sometimes even outright hostility as China increasingly asserts its growing power. The central challenge the country faces here is that its soft power -- its ability to win the hearts and minds of other nations and influence their governments through attraction rather than coercion or payment -- has lagged far behind its hard power built on its growing economic and military might.
China sends fighter jets to disputed zone
Air defense zones: How are they created?
What's South Korea's role in dispute?
In Japan, for instance, public favorability toward China fell from 34% to 5% between 2011 and 2013, according to Pew Global, largely in response to China's new international assertiveness.
Meanwhile, in the United States public favorability toward China fell to 37% in 2013 from 51% in 2011. Issues such as Beijing's alleged currency manipulation, the large size of the U.S. trade deficit with China and the large U.S. financial debt held by Beijing, not to mention alleged Chinese cybersecurity attacks on U.S. interests, has taken its toll on U.S. public opinion.
READ: China strikes balance between sovereignty and stability
With distrust of China growing, many countries in Asia-Pacific are actively strengthening their diplomatic alliances, particularly with Washington, in a bid to balance Beijing's growing economic and military strength. This is a political headache the new Chinese leadership could do without and it must now think hard about how to enhance the country's image in the world.
Most immediately, Beijing must restart a process of addressing concerns of foreign governments about its intentions. Here, it needs to intensify efforts to be seen as a responsible, peaceful power. And match this rhetoric with actions.
President Xi Jinping made a good start toward this goal in his landmark summit with U.S. President Barack Obama last summer. He pledged to form a "new model of co-operation" and that "China and the United States must find a new path ... one that is different from the inevitable confrontation and conflict between the major countries of the past."
As the Pew Global data indicates, China's international image would also benefit from enhanced public diplomacy to win more foreign "hearts and minds." At a symbolic level, example measures might include utilizing the country's growing capabilities in space travel for high-profile international cooperation projects. Surveys underline that many around the world admire China's strength in science and technology.
(China) needs to intensify efforts to be seen as a responsible, peaceful power. And match this rhetoric with actions.Andrew Hammond
A related problem to be tackled is that international communications of Chinese state institutions often lack legitimacy and credibility with foreigners. One solution might be expanding the numbers of non-state groups -- including from civil society networks, diaspora communities, student and academic groups and business networks -- involved in the country's diplomatic outreach.
For many foreign publics, there also needs to be stronger Chinese commitment to domestic political change, transparency and concrete steps towards democratization. Many in the international community are likely to remain wary of the country while it clamps down on its own citizens seeking domestic reform, including human rights activists.
Taken overall, the challenges ahead for China are deep-seated and will require sustained investment and significant reform. However, unless they are tackled, the country's reputational problems will increasingly disable, rather than enable, its ambitions as a rising super power.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Hammond.

Where in the world is the ousted president of Ukraine?
By Elizabeth Landau, CNN
updated 12:05 PM EST, Fri February 28, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ousted President Viktor Yanukovych issued a statement condemning interim government
Ukrainian authorities issued a warrant for Yanukovych's arrest last week
Ukraine gained independence in 1991
(CNN) -- Ukraine's ousted President Viktor Yanukovych went missing in the midst of upheaval in his country, but his whereabouts probably won't be secret for long -- assuming he shows up at his own news conference Friday.
Yanukovych will hold the conference at 5 p.m. Friday in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, Russian state news agency Itar-Tass said Thursday.
Ria Novosti, another state news agency, reported that anonymous government sources said Thursday that Yanukovych was in Russia and that Russian authorities accepted his request for security.
The fugitive president issued a statement to Russian news agencies condemning the country's interim government and alleging that recent actions in the Ukrainian Parliament are illegitimate.
Ukraine going forward
Fmr. Ukraine Pres.: I was not overthrown
Gunmen seize Crimean parliament
Months of anti-government protests reached a bloody climax last week, when street clashes between demonstrators and security forces left more than 80 dead. The protesters' anger was focused on Yanukovych.
Ukrainian authorities issued a warrant for Yanukovych's arrest last week over civilian deaths during the protests.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Kiev approved opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the Batkivschina, or Fatherland, Party as prime minister.
Yanukovych wouldn't be the first controversial figure facing criminal charges to find safe haven in Russia. U.S. National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has been there since June, having been granted a one-year asylum.
Russia has strong ties to Ukraine that extend beyond the supply lines providing most of the country's natural gas.
Ukraine gained independence in 1991; before that, it had, like Russia, been part of the Soviet Union. More historically, most ethnic Ukrainian territory had been part of the Russian Empire. Russian language is spoken by 24% of the population, according to the CIA World Factbook. About 17% of the Ukrainian population is ethnic Russian.
During the Soviet era, in 1954, Russia gave Ukraine a region called Crimea, which has since been in the south of Ukraine and is experiencing unrest this week. Dozens of armed men seized the regional government administration building and parliament there Thursday.
Many ethnic Russians still live in Crimea, where support for Russia is strong. Part of Russia's navy is based in Crimea; a base in the city of Sevastopol that has been there for 230 years.
The eastern part of Ukraine is also heavily influenced by Russia in terms of language, culture and business. CNN's Fred Pleitgen reported this week that many pro-Russians there "are very afraid of what might happen next, who are afraid that their culture, their heritage are in danger, who feel that the Russian language -- which has always had a special status here in Ukraine -- might be in danger of becoming marginalized as well."

Clinton, GOP Bullish On Tax Cuts
The outlook is optimistic, but obstacles remain
By John King/CNN
WASHINGTON (July 15) -- President Bill Clinton and Republican congressional leaders are sounding optimistic about reaching agreement on legislation to balance the federal budget and cut taxes, with talk of bipartisanship and a quick deal dominating a White House
meeting today.
"It does not serve the American people well if we explicitly and publicly turn this into the gunfight at the OK corral," Clinton said.
Republicans reciprocated with happy talk of their own. But major
obstacles remain.
Most taxpayers with children are sure to benefit from any final
agreement because both Clinton and Republicans support a $500-per-child tax credit. But they dont see eye to eye over just who should get this new tax break.
Clinton wants to give the credit to low income workers who
already get a break on their taxes because they fall below the poverty
line. Republicans call that new welfare spending.
The bottom line: Clinton's credit would cover two million more
children than the House Republican plan in the first five years and
300,000 more than the Senate GOP plan.
Democrats accuse Republicans of shortchanging the middle class in
favor of a big cut in capital gains taxes, from 28 percent to 20
percent.
"With regard to fairness perhaps the most important element is to ensure that we provide the bulk of tax relief to working families,"
said Senate minority leader Tom Daschle.
But GOP leaders say cutting capital gains taxes is vital to
encouraging investment, and keeping the economy in high gear.
"We believe there ought to be a tax cut for those who save, invest and create jobs. And I'm very prepared to take on any kind of class warfare argument," said House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Another big question is Medicare reform. Clinton is warming to a
Senate plan that would make elderly couples who earn more than $75,000
a year pay higher taxes.
Such means testing of Medicare is fiercely opposed by liberal
Democrats, who are in no rush for a deal. But Clinton and Republican leaders are in a hurry, and optimistic they can bridge their differences by the end of the month.
"This could end up being a very historic summer," said Gingrich.
Disagreements over education tax breaks also remain to be worked out.
But the White House and GOP leaders are voicing confidence they are
within reach of a deal that would provide the first balanced budget in
three decades, and the first big tax cut in 16 years.

Expert disputes charge of Windows backdoor

NSA key to Windows: an open question
(IDG) -- An independent security expert has questioned allegations made earlier this month (see "Microsoft denies crypto-flaw charge," link below) that the National Security Agency (NSA) has a backdoor to Microsoft Corp.'s Windows platform. Andrew Fernandes, chief scientist at a Mississauga, Ontario-based security software company called Cryptonym Corp., said one of the two keys that Microsoft uses to digitally sign cryptography suites that secure data is called "NSAKEY" in the code. This led to suspicions that the NSA had the ability to sign cryptography suites or insert a Trojan Horse -- both of which could compromise encrypted data on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and NT. But respected cryptographer Bruce Schneier, president of Counterpane Systems, a Minneapolis-based cryptography and security consultancy, noted that if the NSA wanted to compromise Microsoft's CryptoAPI, which supports the encryption of data in Windows programs, there are easier ways. The NSA could convince the company to divulge the secret-key portion of its signature key, for example; get Microsoft to sign an NSA-compromised security module; or install a module other than CryptoAPI to break encryption strategies. "It's not an NSA key so they can secretly install weak cryptography on the unsuspecting masses," said Schneier. "There are just too many smarter things they can do to the unsuspecting masses."

Schneier also pointed out that the NSA doesn't necessarily need a key to compromise security in Windows because programs like Back Orifice can do so on most systems without keys. Perhaps the biggest tip-off to skeptics was the name of the key itself. If the NSA did have a secret key, naming it "NSAKEY" seemed too obvious. While companies such as Microsoft, which don't release their source code for review, are always under suspicion that they could be hiding backdoors in their products, anyone with a debugger could have found the "NSAKEY" name, Schneier observed. Microsoft denies that the NSAKEY key is actually shared with the NSA and asserts that the company has no backdoors in any of its products. "We have not shared it with the NSA or any other third party. It's maintained by Microsoft, and we have it in a secured facility," said Scott Culp, Microsoft's security product manager. Culp said the NSAKEY key is a backup to its primary digital-signature key used to enforce encryption export regulations. Current U.S. law limits exportable software products to 56-bit cryptography unless a waiver is granted. Culp noted that export licenses are granted by the U.S. Department of Commerce, but the technical compliance review is conducted by the NSA -- hence the key name. "It was just a really bad name, just a really poorly chosen name, and I think its safe to assume that we will change the name of that variable," said Culp. Culp explained that developers of general-purpose programs that implement cryptography use Microsoft's CryptoAPI to let Windows encrypt and decrypt data. If developers want to create their own pluggable modules or cryptography suites to implement a particular algorithm in a Windows-compliant program, they can write a cryptographic service provider (CSP) that implements that function. Culp said Microsoft is required by law to make sure that only CSPs that comply with export regulations can be loaded in CryptoAPI. When the CSPs are run under the CryptoAPI, the key verifies the digital signature of the CSP as it loads, confirming that it has met export requirements. "It's not a backdoor. No data encryption is done with these keys; they are signing keys only," said Culp. Culp added that each signing key is actually a pair of keys -- a private and public key. The public signing key resides in every copy of Windows. And the private key, held by Microsoft, is matched with the public key to confirm the identity of the CSP. Culp says the backup NSAKEY was created to ensure that if the secure facility holding the private key was destroyed by an earthquake or other disaster, the company wouldn't have to replace all the public keys in every Windows system.
