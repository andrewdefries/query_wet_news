'Raw Politics': Religious right leaning toward Democrats?Story Highlights Influential Christian leaders are declaring they are tired of divisive politics Evangelicals could potentially be swayed to support Democrats on certain issues For decades, evangelicals have been seen as solid supporters of Republican Party Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO By Tom Foreman CNN Washington Bureau "Raw Politics" on "Anderson Cooper 360" delivers the latest political news with a wry sense of a humor and without spin. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- For decades, evangelicals have been seen as solid supporters of the Republican Party. That could be changing. The religious right, a cornerstone of the so-called Reagan revolution -- the battle over abortion law, and gay marriage -- wants a change. At least some evangelicals do. A group of influential Christian leaders are declaring they are tired of divisive politics, tired of watching fights over some issues trump all the good they could be doing. "Our proposal in [our] manifesto is to join forces with all those who support a civil public square. ... a vision of public life in which people of all faiths -- which, of course, means no faith -- are free to enter and engage public life on the basis of their faith," said evangelical leader Os Guinness. For Democrats, the timing is good. The party has been pushing to overcome the "faith gap," that many feel has hurt them with church-going voters. Candidates are appearing in more religious settings, and conversations. "What I try to do is as best I can be an instrument of His will," Sen. Barack Obama has said.

Election Center 2008
"I obviously was fortunate to be able to rely on and be grounded in my faith which has been anchor for me throughout my entire life," Sen. Hillary Clinton has said. Mara Vanderslice of Common Good Strategies is part of that effort. "I think the biggest thing that we've done wrong is sort of say that we just want a separation of church and state and only speak about religion in terms of separation," Vanderslice said. Evangelicals are now leading public support for many issues dear to Democrats: global campaigns against AIDS, hunger and poverty. Watch how evangelicals are reaching out » Even Congressional Democrats can see the power of a partnership, according to the Ethics and Public Policy Center's Michael Cromartie. "I think there are genuinely religious people, obviously in the Democratic Party, who've said, you know, 'we need to stop toning down how our faith relates to public policy issues,' whether it's the environment or whether it's questions of the economy or war and peace," he said. "And we need to start framing our concerns in religious language so that it might appeal to religious believers in America." Some staunchly conservative evangelicals are critical of the new approach. They are proud of the gains they have made through ties to conservative Republicans. And if Democrats want a share of their support, some political analysts say the Democrats will have to give something in return -- a hotly-debated issue like abortion.

Lawyer: Tabloid's take on Cruise and daughter a 'disgusting, vicious lie' By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 1:09 PM EDT, Thu July 19, 2012
Cruise and Holmes arrive at the 2012 Vanity Fair Oscar Party at Sunset Tower in West Hollywood, California, in February. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes are getting a divorce after five years of marriage, according to Cruise's attorney. Suri Cruise, the daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, plays in the Charles River Basin on October 10, 2009, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Holmes and Cruise were married in November 2006 after Suri, their only child, was born in April of that year.
Cruise plays with Suri in Cambridge on October 10, 2009. Cruise's lawyer said the actor "is very sad about [the divorce] and is concentrating on the kids."
Cruise and Holmes visit Schenley Plaza's carousel with daughter Suri in October 2011 in Pittsburgh. Holmes' lawyer released a statement saying, "This is a personal and private matter for Katie and her family. Katie's primary concern remains, as it always has been, her daughter's best interest."
Holmes shows off her engagement ring as she arrives with Cruise at the UK premiere of "War Of The Worlds" at the Odeon Leicester Square in London in 2005.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tom Cruise struck back at tabloid reports about his relationship with his 6-year-old daughter, Suri in the wake of his divorce from Katie Holmes.
"The tabloids are at it again, trying to make a buck by publishing more grotesquely false claims about Tom Cruise," the actor's attorney Bert Fields said Wednesday.
Fields singled out Life & Style, which he called "a sleazy magazine" for "a bogus cover headline that Suri has been 'ABANDONED BY HER DAD.'"

"That, as anyone knows who saw their photos together yesterday and today, is a disgusting, vicious lie," Fields said.
Cruise and Holmes announced a week ago that they "amicably settled" their divorce, just two weeks after Holmes filed for it.
"Until this week, Tom was shooting a film on location, but he spoke to Suri every day," Field said. "He's with Suri right now; and he was with her the day before Life & Style trumpeted their cruelly false accusation. Tom dearly loves Suri and the last thing he would ever do is abandon her."
Representatives of Life & Style did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.

Report: Gu Kailai admits poisoning British businessman, leading to his death
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 10:54 PM EDT, Thu August 16, 2012
This frame grab taken from CCTV video shows Gu Kailai, the wife of disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai, facing the court during her murder trial in Hefei on August 9, 2012.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The wife of ex-Chinese politician Bo Xilai says, "I suffered a mental breakdown"
A family aide confesses to his role, saying, "I really know that I did wrong" British businessman Neil Heywood died after being poisoned in his hotel room
Gu's murder trial occurred Thursday, though no verdict has been announced
(CNN) -- The wife of a former top Chinese politician has admitted to poisoning a British businessman, blaming a "mental breakdown" for her actions that resulted in Neil Heywood's death, state news reported.
The closely watched murder trial of Gu Kailai took place Thursday, adjourning in the afternoon without the announcement of a verdict, said Tang Yigan, deputy head of the Hefei Intermediate People's Court.
On Friday, the state-run Xinhua news agency offered details on what transpired in court the previous day during the seven-hour long trial. That included a statement by Gu in which she not only didn't deny the accusations levied against her, but "accepted all the facts written in the indictment" -- including poisoning Heywood at a time when she thought her son's life was in danger.
Who is Gu Kailai?
"During those days last November, I suffered a mental breakdown after learning my son was in jeopardy," Gu, 53, said shortly before the trial concluded. "The tragedy, which was created by me, was not only extended to Neil, but also to several families."
Her family aide and alleged co-conspirator, Zhang Xiaojun, likewise admitted to his part in the crime and said he wanted to say "sorry" to the victim's family.
Gu Kailai murder trial ends; no verdict Gu trial set to begin in China
Trying to gain access to Gu Kailai trial
"I hope the court can give me a chance to take a new lease on life," Zhang said in the court in the eastern city of Hefei, according to the Xinhua report. "I really know that I did wrong."
The pair were accused of killing the 41-year-old Heywood last November in a hotel room in the city of Chongqing. Chinese authorities had previously said that Gu and her son had "conflicts" with Heywood "over economic interests" and that she was motivated to kill the Briton because of fears for her son Bo Guagua's safety.
Reached Friday by e-mail, Bo Guagua declined to comment on his mother's confession or "any details pertaining to the case."
Gu's admission is the latest phase in the fall from grace of the prominent family of Bo Xilai, Gu's husband, who until earlier this year had appeared destined to join the elite committee of leaders at the top of China's ruling party.
The family's alleged involvement in Heywood's death triggered the most sensational Chinese political scandal in recent memory. And it created an extraordinary set of challenges for the central government as it prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year.
Why the Gu Kailai trial is important?
Prosecutors said in court Thursday that Gu had invited Heywood to the southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chongqing -- the city where Bo was then the Communist Party chief -- from Beijing. The trial took place 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) east of Chongqing, where Heywood died and where support for Bo and his family remains strong.
Heywood and Gu drank alcohol and tea in a hotel room, after which the Briton got drunk and began vomiting, a prosecutor said. When Heywood asked for water, Gu asked Zhang, who'd been waiting outside, to come into the room.
It was then that Gu got cyanide from Zhang and, after her aide carried Heywood to the bed, poured the poison into the Briton's mouth, according to the prosecutor.
Gu then scattered capsules containing narcotics on the floor to make it seem like Heywood was using drugs, the prosecution said. She put a "Do not disturb" sign on Heywood's hotel room door and told hotel staff not to bother him, a hotel employee said.
Neither Gu nor Zhang objected to the prosecution's outline of the case, according to Tang, the court official, though Gu's lawyer did argue for leniency.
Bo and Gu on trial, in different ways
In her statement, Gu explained how, in 2005, she and her son Bo Guagua got to know Heywood after he wrote them to introduce himself. The Briton later became an agent and participant in a land development project in China that never materialized.
When Heywood asked for compensation, he began to have disputes with the family and -- according to Gu -- threatened her son's personal safety. Prosecutors displayed numerous e-mails between Heywood and Gu's son showing the increasingly heated conflict.
At some point, Gu decided to kill Heywood, prosecutors said. They displayed a statement by Gu in which she said, "To me, that was more than a threat. It was real action that was taking place. I must fight to my death to stop the craziness of Neil Heywood."
In an e-mail to CNN Tuesday, Bo Guagua said he had submitted a witness statement to his mother's defense team.
"I have faith that facts will speak for themselves," wrote Bo, 24, who graduated from Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in May.
A Bo family friend said the court did not accept the younger Bo's statement as evidence Thursday.
Another facet of the case that's drawn international attention, as noted in the Xinhua report, was the fact that an official appointed by Bo's family initially was among those who first decided not to categorize Heywood's death as a criminal case. These authorities covered up Gu's presence at the scene by fabricating interview records and hiding evidence, among other measures, the report said.
The authorities "persuaded" Heywood's relatives to accept their conclusion and cremated the British citizen's body without conducting an autopsy, according to Xinhua. But the case was reopened after Wang Lijun, then vice mayor and police chief of Chongqing, tried to defect to the U.S. consulate in the neighboring Sichuan city of Chengdu.
In a related case, Chinese state media reported Thursday that four top Chongqing policemen will be tried for trying to cover up Heywood's murder to help Gu.
The four -- Guo Weiguo , Li Yang , Wang Pengfei and Wang Zhi -- were charged July 30 and will face trial in Hefei, Xinhua and CCTV reported.
They have been charged with "acting with partiality and defeating the ends of justice," the outlets reported.
CNN's Steven Jiang and Jason Kessler contributed to this report.

Ex-CIA chief Petraeus testifies Benghazi attack was al Qaeda-linked terrorism
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 9:02 PM EST, Fri November 16, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Rep. Peter King says David Petraeus' account differs from an earlier assessment
A U.S. ambassador and three others were killed in the Benghazi attack
Lawmakers say Petraeus said his resignation had nothing to do with Benghazi
Washington (CNN) -- Former CIA Director David Petraeus testified on Capitol Hill Friday that the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in September was an act of terrorism committed by al Qaeda-linked militants.
That's according to U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, who spoke to reporters after a closed hearing in the House, which lasted an hour and 20 minutes.
King said Petraeus' testimony differed from an earlier assessment the former CIA director gave lawmakers just days after the September 11 attack, which left four Americans dead, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.
"He (Petraeus) ... stated that he thought all along he made it clear that there was significant terrorist involvement, and that is not my recollection of what he told us on September 14," King said.
Congress sees attack video
Sen. Coats: No signs of demonstrations
Lawmakers' take on Benghazi footage Ayotte: Serious questions to be answered
"The clear impression we were given (in September) was that the overwhelming amount of evidence was that it arose out of a spontaneous demonstration, and was not a terrorist attack," he said.
U.S. officials initially said the violence erupted spontaneously amid a large protest about a privately made video produced in the United States that mocked the Prophet Mohammed. The intelligence community later revised its assessment, saying it believes the attack was a planned terrorist assault.
King said that the word spontaneous was minimized during Petraeus' testimony Friday, which was given one week after he resigned from the CIA. Lawmakers said they didn't ask him about why he left the agency. Petraeus has admitted an extramarital affair with his biographer.
Critics of the administration have suggested that his resignation might be linked to fallout over the attack.
What do we know so far about the Petraeus scandal?
The Benghazi attack became a political hot button during a presidential election year and raised questions regarding issues such as security at the compound and the Obama administration's initial description of the events.
King told reporters that he likes Petraeus and that it was uncomfortable, at times, to interview a man he considers a friend.
"He was a strong soldier. Very professional, very knowledgeable, very strong," King said. "He's a solid guy. I consider him a friend, which made the questioning tough. You realize the human tragedy here."
After he spoke at the House Intelligence hearing, Petraeus testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He was ushered into both sessions without reporters being able to get a camera shot of him, and after he testified he left the premises, CNN learned.
Petraeus was not asked to testify under oath, King said.
King and other lawmakers said Petraeus testified that his resignation had nothing to do with the consulate attack.
That matches what Petraeus told Kyra Phillips of HLN, CNN's sister network. He said his resignation was solely a result of his extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. He added that he never passed classified information to her.
Prior to Friday's hearings, it was thought that Petraeus would tell lawmakers that the CIA knew soon after the attack that Ansar al Sharia was responsible for it, according to an official with knowledge of the case. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject matter.
Ansar al Sharia is more of a label than an organization, one that's been adopted by conservative Salafist groups across the Arab world.
Related: What is Ansar al Sharia?
It was not known whether Petraeus spoke specifically about Ansar al Sharia during Friday's sessions.
After the House committee hearing, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, said the confusion over the consulate incident arose from there being essentially two threads of violence: one caused by the protest, which was chaotic, and a second that was orchestrated by terrorists, which was highly coordinated.
There were "two different types of situations at play," Ruppersberger said, explaining that in the hours and days after the attack, it was naturally difficult to clearly discern what happened.
Intelligence evolves, he said, and new information comes out when agents obtain it. He played down the idea that there was something untoward going on.
Petraeus: I did not pass on classified information
The former CIA chief has said there was a stream of intelligence from multiple sources, including video at the scene, that indicated Ansar al Sharia was behind the attack, according to an official with knowledge of the situation.
Meanwhile, separate intelligence indicated the violence at the consulate was inspired by protests in Egypt over an ostensibly anti-Islam film clip that was privately produced in the United States. The movie, "Innocence of Muslims," portrayed the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizing buffoon.
There were 20 intelligence reports that indicated that anger about the film may be to blame, the official said.
The CIA eventually disproved those reports, but not before Petraeus' initial briefing to Congress when he discussed who might be behind the attack and what prompted it. During that briefing, he raised Ansar al Sharia's possible connection as well as outrage about the film, the official said.
Earlier, an official said that Petraeus' aim in testifying was to clear up "a lot of misrepresentations of what he told Congress initially."
Petraeus testified that he developed unclassified talking points in the days after the attack but he had no direct involvement in developing the ones used by Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, King said.
"No one knows, yet, exactly who came up with the final version of the talking points, other than to say the original talking points prepared by the CIA were different from the ones that were finally put out," said King, stressing that the original talking points were more specific about al Qaeda involvement.
Rice has been under fire for suggesting the attack on the consulate was a spontaneous event spurred by a protest against the anti-Muslim film.
The three unclassified talking points that were used by Rice on September 16 were read aloud to reporters on the Hill Friday.
They are:
-- The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the US Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex. There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.
-- This assessment may change as additional information is collected and analyzed and as currently available information continues to be evaluated.
-- The investigation is ongoing, and the U.S. government is working with Libyan authorities to bring to justice those responsible for the deaths of U.S. citizens.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who leads the Intelligence Committee, read the points to journalists and vigorously defended Rice.
Feinstein said lawmakers should be careful not to "pillory" someone for intelligence failings.
"We have seen wrong intelligence before and it all surrounded our going into Iraq, and a lot of people were killed based on bad intelligence," she said. "And I don't think that is fair game. I think mistakes get made. You don't pillory the person.
"To select Ambassador Rice because she used an unclassified talking point, to say that she is unqualified to be secretary of state, I think, is a mistake," the senior lawmaker said. "And the way it keeps going it is almost as if the intent is to assassinate her character."
There has been speculation that Rice was among the people being considered as a replacement for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if she steps down as she has indicated.
But the committee's senior Republican, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, said he doesn't think the issue is settled.
He said the concern is not whether the talking points were correct, but that Rice didn't go far enough.
"She knew at that point and time that al Qaeda was very likely responsible in part or in whole for the death of Ambassador Stevens," he said, intimating that Rice should have said that.

Steubenville teens treated girl 'like a toy,' prosecutor says
By Michael Pearson, CNN
updated 1:52 AM EDT, Thu March 14, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Witness says she and the alleged victim shared vodka at a party
Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond,16, are charged with rape
The boys are accused of sexually assaulting a girl at end-of-summer parties
Football players bragged of what they did to a 16-year-old girl, a prosecutor says
(CNN) -- Two Steubenville, Ohio, football stars sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl, treating her "like a toy," a state prosecutor said Wednesday in the opening statement of the teens' rape trial.
Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, are accused of sexually assaulting the girl at a series of end-of-summer parties in August, according to prosecutors.
The case received widespread attention nationally after other Steubenville teens posted images of the alleged victim seemingly unconscious to social media sites.
Defense attorneys say the boys are innocent of rape. Mays is also charged with illegal use of a minor in nudity oriented material.
Although they are minors, they have been identified in court by the judge and attorneys, and in newspapers and other media reports. CNN is not naming the 16-year-old girl in line with its policy of not identifying the alleged victims of sexual assault.
Prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter detailed a string of degrading abuse she said the girl suffered at the hands of the boys, including having her clothes stripped off, while other teens joked about urinating on her.
She said they had "treated her like a toy."
Some of the abuse was captured in cellphone images retrieved from either the Internet or their phones. One, Hemmeter said, showed the girl lying naked on her side, apparently asleep, with what appeared to be semen on her stomach.
Hemmeter said witnesses will testify that the girl was highly intoxicated -- stumbling, slurring her speech, at times unable to walk.
Such impairment, Hemmeter said, would be the state's focus in proving the allegations against Mays and Richmond, not whether the girl consented.
The girl, Hemmeter said, was "too impaired to say no, too impaired to say stop."
In a brief opening statement, one of Mays' defense attorneys, Brian Duncan, told the judge that his client did not rape the girl.
"Trent Mays did not rape the alleged victim, and the prosecution cannot and will not be able to establish and substantiate their claim," Duncan said.
Richmond's attorney, Walter Madison, did not make an opening statement.
Six witnesses for the prosecution testified Wednesday, including a 17-year-old girl who went to a party with the alleged victim. The witness said she and the girl shared a half a bottle of vodka, which they each poured into a flavored crushed ice drink. The alleged victim also had one beer, the witness said.
The alleged victim seemed to get drunk very quickly, the witness said.
About 12:30 a.m., the party broke up and the girl left with Mays and Richmond, according to the witness who said she pleaded with her not go. The witness said she didn't see her again until the next day when she picked the alleged victim up at another home.
She described the girl as a "mess" with her shirt inside out.
Other witnesses said the girl appeared drunk on the night in question while she was at the second house.
Two police officer also testified, describing how they collected evidence.
During cross examinations, the teen's lawyers' tried to poke holes in the witnesses' stories.
While being quizzed by defense attorneys, at least one witness said he did not see the alleged victim drinking and he did not see Mays involved in any sexual contact with the alleged victim.
Another witness said, during cross examination, that she saw the alleged victim bring a bottle of vodka with her to one of the end-of-summer parties in August.
The case, which is being tried before Judge Thomas Lipps without a jury, has cast an unwelcome spotlight on Steubenville, a small, down-on-its-luck town along the banks of the Ohio River.
Social media
Photos, video and social media messages -- some of which the prosecutor displayed Wednesday in court -- are at the heart of criminal charges against Mays and Richmond.
Crime blogger Alexandria Goddard, a former Steubenville resident, discovered and preserved many of the online messages about the case, at least some of which are now in the hands of authorities. The girl's mother also gathered some of the material from social media and brought it to authorities.
One image circulated online and posted on a website maintained by Anonymous, a loosely organized cooperative of activist hackers, showed the girl, dressed in a T-shirt and blue shorts, her body limp, being held hand and foot by two males who appear to be teenagers.
Text messages posted to social networking sites that night seemed to brag about the incident, calling the girl "sloppy," making references to rape and suggesting that she had been urinated on, Goddard has said. CNN has not been able to establish whether this is true.
In one 12-minute video, a teenager who is not charged in the case jokes about the girl's condition, saying she must have died because she didn't move during one assault.
Police got involved on August 14, when the girl's mother reported the alleged assaults, according to Steubenville Police Chief William McCafferty. The family provided a zip drive showing a Twitter page, possibly with a photo, McCafferty said.
Unwanted spotlight
The allegations -- and the shadow it has cast over the town -- have gripped the area for months.
The case has attracted the attention of bloggers and even Anonymous, who have questioned everything from the behavior of the football team to the veracity of the investigation.
Rape allegations engulf town
Steubenville was once a thriving steel mill town. With the mills closed, the town is a shadow of its former self as some of its residents moved away to find work elsewhere and some businesses closed.
Today, its population is primarily blue collar with a median income between $33,000 and $34,000, well below the national average.
The Steubenville High School football games have long been a gathering point for residents, who point to the team's against-all-odds play that helped elevate its reputation in the state.
Critics have accused community leaders of trying to paper over rampant misconduct by players of the Steubenville High School team and have suggested that other students took part in the assaults or failed to do enough stop them.
While many residents express concern about the allegations against Mays and Richmond, they are also frustrated with how the town has been portrayed.
"We all want to see justice prevail for the victim and the defendants in this case. All of you are here today because you are doing your job and writing your story," Susan Hershey, the president of the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce.
"There (are), however, always multiple sides to every story. There is the other side of our community, a side that has been overshadowed by this incident. Unfortunately, our community has been painted with one very unflattering, broad brush."

Anton Hysen: Gay soccer players want to come out
By James Masters, CNN
updated 6:05 AM EDT, Fri September 27, 2013
In 2011, Anton Hysen became only the second active footballer to come out as being gay -- more than 20 years after Justin Fashanu did so. While Fashanu was a high-profile star in England, Hysen plays in Sweden's lower leagues.
Hysen supported a campaign asking players to wear rainbow-colored laces to promote awareness of homophobia in football. However, Fulham's David Stockdale (pictured) was one of the few players at British clubs who took up the invitation. Former United States and Leeds United striker Robbie Rogers used his website to announce he was gay earlier in 2013 -- but then promptly retired from football at the tender age of 25. However, just months later he returned to the game with Major League Soccer team Los Angeles Galaxy.
England international striker Fashanu, the country's first £1 million black footballer, could not live with the scars of his revelation. He committed suicide in 1998.
Former NBA player John Amaechi, who was raised in Britain, broke barriers as the first professional basketballer to announce he was gay in 2007. He made the revelations in his autobiography after retiring from the game.
Jason Collins of the Washington Wizards became the first active NBA player to announce that he is gay on April 29, 2013. The 34-year-old was made a free agent in July but said he wanted to continue playing.
Sport's biggest lesbian star is 18-time grand slam tennis champion Martina Navratilova, who announced she was gay shortly after gaining U.S. citizenship in 1981. Her revelation came relatively early in her career and she went on to win many more titles.
American four-time Olympic gold medallist Greg Louganis came out as gay when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1988. He told CNN's Piers Morgan in 2012 he believes in "equal rights for everybody."
Former Wales rugby union captain Gareth Thomas described the conflict between his sport and his sexuality when he came out in 2009, telling the Daily Mail newspaper: "It is barbaric. I could never have come out without first establishing myself and earning respect as a player."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Anton Hysen was the second active football player to come out as openly gay
He has received calls from players too scared to come out in the game
Labels Russia's anti-gay laws as "Stone Age" ahead of 2014 Sochi Games
Hopes he can help fellow gay players to come out in the future
(CNN) -- Anton Hysen is a football player. He is also gay.
"So what?" he says. "Being gay is not a choice -- I hate it when people say that."
In March 2011, Hysen, who plays in the lower leagues in Sweden, became the first man to come out in more than 20 years within the world of football. He broke the taboo.
Fast forward two years and, while his life has changed immeasurably, the same problems remain.
"There's so much ignorance," he told CNN in an exclusive interview.
"There's a lack of knowledge. Some people who are homophobic don't even know a gay person. It's all about preconceptions.
Tweets by @CNNFC
"I hear that football players are supposed to be masculine. I know plenty of straight guys who are more effeminate.
"There's this illusion that every football player has to be macho and have a model girlfriend. It's not acceptable to be a gay player.
"Why not? We can run, we can play, we can score. So what's the problem?"
Read: Is laces campaign tied up in knots?
The fight against homophobia in football has been stepped up in the UK in particular, with the "Rainbow Laces" campaign taking center stage over recent days.
Stonewall, a UK-based gay, lesbian and bisexual charity, teamed up with Irish bookmaker Paddy Power to promote the initiative -- which urged players to wear the colored laces to promote awareness.
The organization sent laces to all 92 professional clubs in England and the 42 in Scotland but enjoyed only limited success, with clubs unhappy with the inclusion of a gambling firm and a lack of notice given by the charity.
Many football fans took to Twitter to say they were unable to even see the laces, especially with players often boasting luminous footwear, while some professionals decided against wearing them for a multitude of reasons.
'It needs to be discussed'
But while he supports the campaign -- Hysen wore the laces during his most recent game -- he stresses that it is only a small step in bringing about a meaningful change in attitudes towards homophobia.
"I think it's a good idea," he said, after laughing that he had hit the post when he should have scored in that previous match.
"It's not a big change but it is a step forward. It's the least we can do. We can have lectures, we can ban people -- and laces won't change the mind of an idiot.
Former Missouri Tigers defensive end and 2014 NFL draft entrant Michael Sam tells ESPN and The New York Times that he is gay on February 9. Sam is seen here running on to the field before the NCAA Senior Bowl on Saturday, January 25, in Mobile, Alabama.
Robbie Rogers became the first openly gay male athlete to play in a professional American sporting match May 26 when he took the field for Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy during a match against the Seattle Sounders. Take a look at other openly gay athletes.
"I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation," NBA player Jason Collins said in a Sports Illustrated article. Sheryl Swoopes, a retired WNBA star and coach of the Loyola University Chicago's women's basketball team, came out in 2005.
Brittney Griner, selected No. 1 in the 2013 WNBA draft by the Phoenix Mercury, is openly gay. In an exclusive interview with CNN, former San Francisco 49ers player Kwame Harris came out as gay after rumors circulated in the media. Gareth Thomas of Wales spoke about being gay to a British news channel in 2009. Justin Fashanu became the first openly gay soccer player in Europe when he came out in 1990. Eight years later, he took his own life. Tennis great Martina Navratilova came out in 1981.
After his retirement in 2007, basketball player John Amaechi announced he was gay.
After retiring from professional football in 1972, David Kopay acknowledged to the Washington Star that he was gay.
Villanova University's Will Sheridan came out to his teammates in 2003.
In 2012, U.S. women's soccer player Megan Rapinoe confirmed in Out magazine that she was a lesbian.
Champion figure skater Johnny Weir confirmed in his 2011 memoir, "Welcome to My World," that he was gay.
Australia's Matthew Mitcham came out in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald in 2008.

Marcus Urban was an East German football player who turned his back on the sport in order to live as an openly gay man. Urban told his story in the book "Versteckspieler: Die Geschichte des schwulen Fußballers Marcus Urban", "Hidden Player: the story of the gay footballer Marcus Urban".
Urban, pictured on the far left, began his career in 1978 when he joined East German club Motor Weimar at the age of seven. He moved to Rot-Weiss Erfurt in 1984, where he won a youth championship.
The midfielder's reputation was growing and he was called up to the East German youth team in 1986. He made over 100 appearances for Rot-Weiss' first team, but Urban felt burdened by his sexuality. "Constantly hearing gay used as a curse word like s**t, made me think, 'Of course, I'm s**t," Urban told CNN.
Urban's form suffered and, following a stint with provincial club SC 1903 Weimar, he gave up on his dream of becoming a professional footballer. "I realized that if I became a professional footballer, I would suffer as a man," he explained. "I chose freedom over a constructed prison."
Since "coming out" Urban has been able to reignite his love for the beautiful game. He now consults with organizations, including football associations, on issues of diversity and integration. "There are certainly more boring lives than mine," he said.
Former United States international Robbie Rogers attracted headlines by announcing himself as gay after retiring for football, aged just 25, earlier this year. Rogers was recently invited to train with Major League Soccer champions Los Angeles Galaxy.
Jason Collins, currently a free agent, made NBA history last month by becoming the first male athlete in a major North American sport to come out as gay.
Urban believes rugby player Gareth Thomas set the perfect example for athletes wishing to "come out". "He proceeded in stages," Urban said of the Welshman who publicly revealed his sexuality in 2009. "First he outed himself to his wife. Then he told his coach and then two players. After each step he received positive feedback."

Marcus Urban's battle with homophobia in football
Olympian opposes Russia boycott
"A homophobe won't change his mind because players are wearing rainbow laces, but we're putting it into their minds and we're putting the issue into society so we can talk about it.
"It might make people more aware and make them reconsider but it's not going to make people come out instantly.
"We can talk about it and discuss it. It needs to be discussed. There are not many players out there (wearing them) but it's a nice gesture.
"I've heard some idiotic excuses. I respect anyone who doesn't want to (wear them) and has strong opinions on the matter but don't give lame excuses. That's silly.
"There are a lot of different things we can do -- but this shows some players are ready to show their support. Seeing a professional wearing them is great and gives comfort to gay people who are playing and aren't ready to come out."
Who's next?
In February, U.S. soccer player Robbie Rogers revealed he is gay but at the same time announced he was retiring from the sport.
Rogers, who was playing in England at the time, has since reversed his decision to quit and now plays back in his homeland with Major League Soccer side Los Angeles Galaxy.
But not since the tragic death of Justin Fashanu has a top-flight division witnessed an openly gay professional football player.
Fashanu, who committed suicide in 1998, became the first £1 million black player in the history of English football when he signed for Nottingham Forest in 1981.
Constant speculation surrounded his private life, and at one time he reportedly claimed he'd had affairs with Conservative MPs -- which further fueled media interest.

With the rumors continuing throughout his career, he finally came out in 1990 and continued to play for a whole host of lower league clubs.
Read: Rogers' retirement reasons could bring change
"You have to understand," he said in an interview before his death, "that footballers are very narrow-minded people. It's the nature of the business. When you put yourself in the firing line, you are open to attack. I know I'm there to be shot down in flames."
Following his passing, one particular group of fans would recite the chant: "He's gay, he's dead, he's hanging in a shed, Fashanu, Fashanu."
'I hope someone else will come out'
While there has been huge progress since those dark days, the presence of homophobia in football has not been extinguished.
Hysen had hoped that he would become a trailblazer -- but Rogers aside, there has been little movement in terms of players coming out.
"I've had quite a few anonymous phone calls from players who want to come out but I don't know who they are or where they play," said Hysen.
"I hope that someone else will come out just like Robbie Rogers did. That was great for U.S. soccer. At last we're having a discussion about it and that's huge.
"It has been pretty quiet and I understand that. People might not want to come out publicly and I understand.
There's this illusion that every football player has to be macho and have a model girlfriend. It's not acceptable to be a gay player.Anton Hysen
"For me, the whole experience has been really positive. I've not had any trouble at all. If somebody says something, then I don't care. I don't have time for any of that. I don't waste my energy on that.
"Lately it has been really good -- I don't know why it's a problem."
Putting the Gay in Games
But it's not just in football where the problem exists -- the 2014 Winter Olympics have also courted controversy following the Russian government's decision to implement a new law banning "propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors."
There have been protests across the globe, with some athletes threatening to boycott the Games over what they believe are archaic and draconian laws.
Russia says the legislation is intended to protect children by prohibiting discussion of gay rights and relationships within their earshot.

"I don't understand what's happening in Russia," sighs Hysen. "What year are we in?
"It's like the Stone Age out there. I respect their laws. It's their country and I respect that but it's all about human rights. We're all humans. It's prehistoric stuff. It's 2013 now.
"Athletes aren't going there because of their sexuality. You're going there to perform your sport -- you go out there and play and do your best.
"You're not living there -- you're just going to compete. It's a problem. It's difficult because you have to respect their laws but it's ridiculous how we treat people in the 21st century.

Hysen is not shy in giving his views -- although he does squirm at the thought that he has become some kind of spokesman for gay sports stars: "I always speak from the heart and don't care what I say."
With a strong family around him, he has grown into a confident and aspiring young man who quickly realized that his life would never be the same.
But by his own admission, the fact that he is the son of Glenn Hysen, the former Liverpool and Sweden international footballer, may have given him an advantage which others may not be as fortunate to enjoy.
Read: The gay footballer who chose freedom As a player, his father won the now defunct UEFA Cup twice with Swedish side IFK Gothenburg before moving to England, where he won the league title in 1991.
He is now on the coaching staff at Anton's third division club Utsiktens, while brothers Tobias and Alexander are also professional footballers.
Dancing star
But Anton is famous in his own right -- his story an inspiration to millions around the world -- while he cites his victory in Sweden's "Dancing with the Stars" as another reason for his current popularity.
"In Sweden I get recognized a lot from my football but also from the dancing," he laughs.
"I didn't think people would care that much but it's nice.
"When I first came out I thought I would be in the newspapers in Sweden for a couple of days and that's it -- I didn't think people would really care to be honest.
"And then suddenly it went crazy, and within two days the whole world knew, but it feels pretty good. I know that I've done something good with my life.
"I was just a kid who happened to be gay -- I never thought it would be such a big deal."
