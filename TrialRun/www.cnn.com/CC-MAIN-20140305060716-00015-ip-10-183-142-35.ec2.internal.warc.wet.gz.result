WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Check out the links below to hot political stories around the country this morning.
CLARK WINS: Wesley Clark won the initial votes cast Tuesday morning in New Hampshire's Democratic presidential primary, but final pre-primary polls rated Sen. John Kerry the favorite.
The Las Vegas Sun: Candidates wait as voting begins in N.H.
BITTER COLD: On the threshold of the nation's first primary, the Democratic presidential candidates raced across the frigid New Hampshire landscape Monday, offering closing arguments to large and attentive crowds and undermining their rivals with barbed exchanges on issues from abortion rights to the Iraq war. Kerry weighed in with a last-minute appeal to abortion-rights activists.
The Washington Post: In New Hampshire, a testy primary eve
LASAGNA NO MORE: John Kerry admits he's not on his game (actually, his exact words were "bleh"). And so help him God, if he sees another slice of lasagna today ....
The New York Times: Sleepless, grueling days are fine, but, please, no more lasagna
BEATING BUSH: A large number of New Hampshire voters were undecided as recently as last weekend. In interview after interview, Democratic and independent voters said beating President Bush was their No. 1 priority. The random interviews seem to confirm polls in Iowa, where voters said electability in November was one of their most important considerations. "Anyone but Bush" has become something of a mantra here.
The New York Times: Undecided, and out of time in New Hampshire
SEALING THE DEAL: The '04 Dems exchanged bitter words as they hurried across New Hampshire yesterday, overwhelming the state's towns, roads, and airwaves in their final campaigning before polls open today.
The Boston Globe: A fight to the finish in N.H.
GLORY DAYS: John McCain, called into action by Dick Cheney, returned to the site of his greatest political triumph Monday and campaigned for the man who ended his dreams for the White House in 2000 � President Bush.
USA Today: McCain campaigns for Bush in N.H.
THREE TICKETS OUTTA HERE: The big battle today is for third place, because voters appear poised to give John Kerry and Howard Dean a solid one-two showing. Wesley Clark, John Edwards and Joe Lieberman are in a three-way statistical tie for third place in one of the latest polls for the nation's first binding primary.
The Washington Times: Democrats battle for 3rd place
CORZINE FOR KERRY: New Jersey Sen. Jon Corzine will endorse Senate colleague John Kerry for president today during a news conference in Trenton, according to Democrats close to the decision.
The Star-Ledger: Corzine is expected to support Kerry's presidential bid today
WHAT THE TABS ARE SAYING:
SMEAR DEAN: Dean charged yesterday that unnamed opponents had unleashed a war of "dirty tricks" to try to stop him - including a forged anti-gay email. Dean's aides released 18 pages of documents that they said proved an organized attempt to discredit the ex-Vermont governor and turn off his supporters the day before the primary vote here. Dean refused to say who he thought was behind the smear.
The New York Post: Howard lashes out at cyber 'smear campaign'
CLAWING AND SWATTING: Howard Dean tried to claw his way back into contention on the eve of today's primary, swatting at John Kerry for his Iraq war vote and accusing the front-runner's campaign of dirty tricks.
Daily News: Dean rips Kerry in late offensive
KERRY'S NORTHERN STRATEGY: Certified front-runner or suddenly on the ropes, John Kerry peels out of New Hampshire tomorrow night into a far less certain spat of contests in the South, West and middle America. Though many say the first real test is in the South, Kerry openly questioned the strategy.
The Boston Herald: Kerry looks past South, focuses on national strategy

Is creatine a safe supplement? Asked by Ralph, New York I am a 48-year-old man who weight trains four times a week. I am thinking about taking creatine. What is your thought on this supplement? Diet and Fitness Expert
Dr. Melina Jampolis
Physician Nutrition Specialist
Expert answer Hi Ralph! Weight training four times a week is terrific. I hope that you are also getting regular aerobic exercise for cardiovascular health. To answer your question, creatine monohydrate, the most extensively studied form of creatine, is considered the most effective supplement for athletes looking to increase lean body mass and as well as enhance muscular strength, power and endurance. Despite a few widely publicized, but mainly anecdotal reports, of kidney or electrolyte abnormalities, hundreds of studies have found that it is safe in healthy individuals and may also be effective for people with certain medical conditions, including heart patients, and on some types of neuromuscular disease or orthopedic injury if taken at recommended doses. Creatine is produced in the liver and pancreas from the amino acids arginine, glycine and methionine. The majority of creatine is stored in skeletal muscle as phosphocreatine and free creatine. Phosphocreatine is a critical component of energy generation in the muscle. With intense exercise, levels are depleted and therefore the ability to exercise intensely diminishes. By increasing the amount of phosphocreatine in the muscle, this should allow you to work the muscle harder and longer, thereby increasing your muscle gains. Long-term supplementation has shown a 5% to 15% increase in strength and performance and double the gain in lean body mass compared to placebo. Dietary sources of creatine include meats and fish, but in order to consume effective quantities, large amounts would have to be consumed. Therefore, if you are eating a healthy diet with adequate amounts of high quality protein and training regularly, creatine may be effective if your goal is to increase muscle mass or strength. Many sports nutrition experts suggest "loading" for three to five days with 0.3 grams per kilogram per day followed by a maintenance dose of 3 to 5 grams per day. The loading phase is not essential but may allow you to see gains more quickly. Research suggests that combining creatine with carbohydrate or carbohydrate plus protein produces optimal results by enhancing creatine uptake and retention. There are numerous other combinations under investigation. Dr. Jose Antonio, CEO of the International Society of Sports Nutrition and professor at Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida, notes that one of the more promising for increasing lean body mass and strength is the combination of creatine and beta-alanine, a nonessential amino acid that has been shown to increase skeletal muscle carnosine. Increased muscle concentrations of carnosine have been shown to enhance anaerobic exercise performance. In summary, when used correctly, creatine can be a safe and effective performance-enhancing supplement for athletes or fitness enthusiasts who are willing to do the accompanying physical work necessary to fully benefit.

Will bin Laden's death end the United States' Afghan war? By the CNN Wire Staff President Obama has promised to start a withdrawal from Afghanistan in July and complete it by 2014. STORY HIGHLIGHTSSome analysts say the death of bin Laden will increase public pressure to leave AfghanistanAmericans remain opposed to the U.S. war in AfghanistanA congressional expert says Obama may feel emboldened to pursue any courseA political scientist says Obama has political cover to pull back from Afghanistan if he wants Washington (CNN) -- A decade ago, al Qaeda operatives working out of a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan planned the terror attacks against New York and Washington. Today, the Taliban has lost control of Afghanistan and al Qaeda's leader is dead. Is it time for the United States to declare victory and bring the troops home? The death of Osama bin Laden may prove to be a pivotal moment for both Democrats and Republicans exhausted by the conflict and seeking greater fiscal restraint in a new age of austerity, according to some political analysts. Others, however, argue the successful raid on bin Laden's Pakistani compound will only strengthen the hand of a president who has so far proven largely resistant to popular sentiment on the conflict. The U.S. war in Afghanistan has long been unpopular with the public. Forty-two percent of Americans supported the war in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released earlier this week. Fifty-two percent were opposed. Afghans react to bin Laden's death

Barack Obama
Opposition to the war remains strongest among more liberal voters -- President Barack Obama's political base. Obama has promised to start a withdrawal from Afghanistan in July and complete it by 2014. On Thursday, bipartisan legislation will be introduced requiring the president to submit a more specific timeline to Congress. The new timeline would, among other things, include dates specifying when the U.S. military will hand over security and military responsibilities to the Afghan government. It would also require the administration to file quarterly reports with Congress about the status and costs of the transition. Defense Secretary Robert Gates "has already said we will be there until 2014. I think we ought to be out of Afghanistan in the next year or so," said Rep. Walter Jones, R-North Carolina, one of the bill's sponsors. "The leader of al Qaeda is now dead. There are no al Qaeda to speak of in Afghanistan." Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has also questioned whether the United States now needs to change course, noting the reason the U.S. military first went to Afghanistan was to hunt down bin Laden. Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, hasn't backed Jones' measure, which appears to have little chance of clearing the Republican-controlled House. The successful raid on bin Laden's compound only "makes our engagement in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan more important," he said. Regardless of which way the political winds are blowing, "bin Laden's death gives the president more leeway in adjusting his policy on Afghanistan, such as hastening negotiations with the Taliban and making the initial troop withdrawal a substantial one," said Tom Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a Washington think tank. "I don't think increased political pressure to accelerate the timeline for U.S. withdrawal will force his hand, but it may strengthen his determination to follow the course he prefers," Mann told CNN. Adam Sheingate, a Johns Hopkins political scientist, agreed that "political pressure from Congress for an accelerated timeline will not affect U.S. policy on the ground." "This creates an opportunity for Jones ... and others to get attention for their policy views about Afghanistan," Sheingate said, referring to the North Carolina congressman. "However, the advantage remains with the president and not with Congress to decide what U.S. policy will be in the region." To the extent that the president wants to get Afghanistan off the political table before the 2012 election, he may now have added leverage against Republicans who would otherwise accuse him of weakness in light of a scaled-back American presence that country. "The capture and killing of Osama bin Laden may perhaps turn out to be precisely the kind of political cover that Obama needs to accelerate the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan without looking weak on the war on terror," said Wendy Schiller, a Brown University political scientist. "The bottom line is that there is a limit to the American public's support for war. The cost in dollars and human lives has been substantial, and with so many vitally important economic issues to be dealt with at home, there is a receptive audience for any proposal to bring our troops home sooner rather than later." In some ways, Schiller argues, "the death of bin Laden highlights the ambiguity of our mission in Afghanistan. Originally it was sold to the American public as a retaliatory strike against the Taliban for harboring a terrorist, but it has been sustained with the justification that supporting a democracy in Afghanistan will keep the Taliban from regaining power." Now, in the face of continuing struggles against the Taliban and allegations of corruption on the part of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, "the entire foundation for being there has deeply eroded," Schiller said. Some military and diplomatic experts argue that the death of bin Laden is actually the ideal opportunity for the United States to step up its commitment in Afghanistan. Former Gen. Wesley Clark, former NATO supreme allied commander, said recently that Washington can't afford to "invite a repeat of the Taliban takeover of the 1990s (or have) instability in Pakistan." "This argues for using the momentum of the success against bin Laden to intensify the military pressures against the Taliban, both inside Afghanistan and at their sanctuaries in Pakistan," Clark said. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested Monday that bin Laden's death offered a unique opportunity for a wider settlement with Taliban leaders now more eager to split off from a weakened al Qaeda. The political ball -- now more than ever -- appears to be clearly in Obama's court. CNN's Alan Silverleib and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report

Celebrating Thanksgiving with 'Generation Alzheimer's'
By Elizabeth Landau, CNN
updated 9:28 AM EST, Thu November 22, 2012
A family member with dementia will have a better Thanksgiving experience in a small-group setting, says expert Laura Wayman.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
About 10 million baby boomers will develop Alzheimer's, the Alzheimer's Association says
More than 15 million Americans are providing unpaid care for a person with dementia
Don't begin conversations with people with dementia with "Do you remember ..."
Instead, try saying "Wasn't it fun when we ..." (CNN) -- Judy Warzenski didn't realize how bad her father, Donald's, memory had gotten until he turned to her sister Joyce and asked, "Where's the girl who was sitting next to you?" He did not recognize Joyce as his own daughter.
This Thanksgiving, Warzenski and her younger siblings will eat Thanksgiving dinner with their father in a private dining room at a nursing home in Pennsylvania. Moving her father there in October was an agonizing decision.
"It's really very upsetting to me," said Warzenski, 62, of central New Jersey. "I promised him I would never do this. I promised him I would never put him in a nursing home, which I've come to realize is an unrealistic promise."
Warzenski, who had commented on a previous CNN dementia story, is one of many baby boomers who must watch their loved ones suffer from Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia. The condition, which robs people of their memory and thinking skills, necessitates tough decisions about caring for people as their minds slowly slip away.
"Often, the baby boomers are thrust into the position of caring for a loved one with dementia because that loved one declines and needs 24-hour supervision," said Laura Wayman, a dementia care specialist and author of "A Loving Approach to Dementia Care."

Dispelling myths about Alzheimer's
The Alzheimer's Association says that unless a treatment or cure is found, Alzheimer's "will become the defining disease of the Baby Boom Generation" or, as the association calls it, "Generation Alzheimer's." Currently, there is no proven method to fully stop the progression of symptoms or reverse them.
Approximately 10 million baby boomers will develop Alzheimer's, according to estimates from the Alzheimer's Association. Of those who reach the age of 85, nearly one in two will get it.
Most people with Alzheimer's begin experiencing symptoms after age 60, according to the National Institutes of Health. Only 5% of people with the condition start showing signs of it before age 65; this is called early-onset Alzheimer's. Symptoms can even begin in the 30s, 40s or 50s, and in some cases there is a clear genetic link.
Can hormone therapy help protect the brain?
Many of the boomers taking care of loved ones with dementia have children of their own, forcing them into a "sandwich generation" situation that comes along with a lot of financial strain.
Some caregivers are resistant to asking for help, but it's essential that they have a support network, Wayman said. The caregiver's own health, finances, income and employment may suffer. Wayman's own mother died of a heart attack while caring for Wayman's father.
"They feel like they should be able to take care of this person, and they can't do it by themselves," she said.
More than 15 million Americans are providing unpaid care for a person with dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association. That care amounts to $210 billion in unpaid hours. And 80% of home care for people with dementia comes from family members.
Living with Alzheimer's Bill Carey, 54, of Ferndale, Michigan, is one of those with early-onset Alzheimer's who is still able to articulate and understand what's happening. He is the third person in his family to receive a diagnosis of Alzheimer's.
Carey has known he has the condition for about nine years, as he wrote in the comments on a previous CNN story. A spinal tap confirmed that he has high levels of a protein associated with Alzheimer's. His speech is still coherent, but he had to give up his job as an apartment manager because he was making mistakes: for example, he could no longer handle adding up the amounts on rent checks.
"Even with simple arithmetic, my brain just shuts down," he said. "It's like there's nothing there."
Alzheimer's called 'defining disease' of baby boomers
But Carey isn't sitting by idly. He goes to a local support group with others who are in the early stages of Alzheimer's. They talk about the things that they remember and share coping techniques. He also takes the medications Aricept and Namenda, designed to slow the progression of symptoms, and they appear to be working. To keep his mind challenged, he does jigsaw puzzles on his computer.
Carey's domestic partner, Larry Stowell, sorts out his medications, handles Carey's finances and has "been extremely supportive" overall, Carey says. The two will spend Thanksgiving alone. Although Carey doesn't cook as much as he used to, he is charge of the turkey.
"I haven't set fire to the house yet," Carey said. "I'm sure Larry will tell me when I reach that point."
Caring for a wife Others are still in their 50s and further gone. Mike of Massachusetts writes in an e-mail that he is "Feeling as if I've lost my wife and had her replaced by a child who looks like her."
His wife, Sally, is only 51 and has dementia. The couple is unsure whether it is specifically Alzheimer's, but she may get further testing to find out.
"I feel as if we can't really talk seriously about anything anymore, and I have to make all of the decisions in our lives," Mike said.
Mike asked that his wife's name be changed and that their last name not be used. He requested to be interviewed over e-mail instead of the phone so that his wife would not overhear and get upset.
Their adult daughter lives with them and helps out. Mike is also looking into adult day care and is trying to get friends to take Sally out of the house now and then so he can have some respite.
Mike says the two are rarely physically intimate anymore.
Mike and Sally are not going to be celebrating Thanksgiving on Thursday. Mike has to work that day, and Sally cannot cook. She can no longer operate a shower, plug in a hair dryer or use a dishwasher, Mike says.
Report: Yearly cost of Alzheimer's tops $200 billion
What to do for Thanksgiving Wayman offers these tips for spending Thanksgiving with a person with dementia:
• While preparing the food, reminisce about past Thanksgivings. But don't ask, "Do you remember when ..." something happened, since you don't know how much has been forgotten. Instead, try starting your memories with "Wasn't it fun when we ..."
• Limit the number of guests at the meal. You might even want to have two different Thanksgiving meals if there are a lot of people who would want to come. People with dementia have trouble processing and tracking information, so if there a lot of people, they may have extra difficulty following a conversation.
• Make sure there is a place for the person with dementia to rest if he or she feels overwhelmed.
• Fill your home with pleasant, traditional, soothing aromas. Put a couple of teaspoons of vanilla in a baking pan to make the kitchen smell like desserts baking. Cooking the meal may also produce smells that are familiar to your loved one with dementia.
• Incorporate the person with dementia in food preparation as appropriate, perhaps by stirring a mixture or setting a table. But safety is the priority: Wayman knows a family whose mother with dementia went to get the turkey from the oven but fell and burned herself.
And after
Although Warzenski feels bad about her father having to be in a nursing home, he doesn't say that he needs to go home. Instead he might say, "I need to get my car," she says.
Warzenski is grateful that he is safe and won't hurt himself in the middle of the night. He does not appear to be aware that he's in a facility. At this point, she just wants him to be comfortable.
"For him to pass would be a blessing to him," Warzenski said. "He was a police officer. If he ever realized what had become of him, he would be mortified."

How to make your workout seem shorter
By Will Cleveland, Special to CNN
updated 4:32 PM EST, Fri February 22, 2013
Will Cleveland poses for a photo in Phuket, Thailand. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Will Cleveland imagines places he'd like to visit to motivate him through workouts
Cleveland wants to get and stay healthy so he can travel with his son
"Certain parts of the world simply require you to be fit to enjoy them," he says
Editor's note: Will Cleveland is one of six CNN viewers selected to be a part of the Fit Nation Triathlon Challenge program. Follow the "6-pack" on Twitter and Facebook as they train to race the Nautica Malibu Triathlon with Dr. Sanjay Gupta on September 8.
(CNN) -- When I hit what runners call "the wall," I imagine myself jogging along the coast of Cape Town during a sunset, smelling the salt in the air and hearing seagulls cawing.
When my pace in the pool begins to slow, I pretend I'm swimming upstream in the Amazon, pushing against the current. Or I let my mind wander to the rapids of the Congo or the beauty of the Great Barrier Reef as I swim by.
As I run drills, I am not on my usual trail on the back road of my neighborhood; I am kicking up sand in a foreign land that one day I wish to see -- like the Sahara Desert or the volcanic beaches of the Galapagos Islands.
Certain parts of the world simply require you to be fit to enjoy them -- such as a swim in the Mediterranean, a trek in the Andes of Peru or a bike ride through the Netherlands.

Feeling the burn with Jillian Michaels
When I turned 6, I remember what I got for my birthday: a G.I. Joe set with action figures and a tank, Legos, a soccer ball and an Atlas book that was as tall as I was. I remember this because that is when my interest in traveling started. I pretty much pushed the rest of my toys to the side and made that giant book my home.
My mother tells me, "You would keep coming up to me asking me what this place is like and what that place looks like." It was truly the beginning of an obsession that I have to this day.
My father was in the Army; my mom was Air Force civilian personnel. When I got my giant atlas I was living in Tacoma, Washington; shortly after, my mother and I relocated to an Air Force base at the Cotswolds in the United Kingdom.
While we lived in England, my aunt and uncle would come out to visit and take trips with us through Europe. I was 8 years old when I first saw the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. I still remember to this day touring Buckingham Palace and seeing Big Ben.
Getting fit for the family I love
When I turned 17, I joined the Army and started hopping countries on my own: Turkey, Kuwait, Iraq. I saw the Nur Mountains portside and enjoyed the sights of desert sunrises on many convoys. I also had the pleasure of visiting the Bahamas and some great areas of Arkansas. But there are still many things I haven't seen!
I have a son now. His name is Jaedon and he just turned 1. I want him to have the same passion for the world that I developed as a child. I want to share the world with him as he grows. The only way I can do that is by getting healthy -- and staying healthy -- long-term.
As I join the Fit Nation team in training for this triathlon, and learn to make healthy choices day-to-day, my boy and I will continue to learn and explore together. I've had problems in the past with partying and smoking. But to me there is no drug in the world that can replace the knowledge of different cultures and regions of our planet.
And that's why I run and bike and swim; why I picture running through the heat of the outback, biking down the steep hills of California, swimming through the thrashing waves of Hawaii or any other place that I have not yet seen.
Because it's what keeps me going.
I will continue to make my health a priority so that one day my boy will have to wonder why he can't keep up with his dad... wherever we may be.

From ducks to chickens to deadly virus
By Nathan Wolfe and Oliver Pybus, Special to CNN
updated 2:44 PM EDT, Wed August 21, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Authors: New study traces origin of flu virus that kills a third of victims
They say it shows the need for vigilance and prevention measures vs. flu
Ducks could help create the next flu pandemic, need careful monitoring, they say
Authors: There's a growing arsenal of tools that will be useful in prevention
Editor's note: Nathan Wolfe is Founder & CEO of Metabiota, a company addressing global infectious disease risk, & the Lorry I. Lokey Consulting Professor of Human Biology at Stanford University. Follow him on Twitter: @virushunter. Oliver Pybus is a Professor at the University of Oxford and a Consulting Senior Scientist at Metabiota and a co-author of a new study in Nature that reports the discovery of the origins of the H7N9 influenza virus.
(CNN) -- Influenza is a little like poker. Only when it wins, we lose.
When a new variant of influenza emerges, it starts with the viral equivalent of a poker hand made up of eight genetic segments. Like getting a four of diamonds or a queen of spades, H7N9 was effectively dealt a seven of Hemagluttinin (the H) and a nine of Neuraminadase (the N). Along with the genes on its other six segments, the H and N determine whether a new virus has the capability to spread in the global human population, the epidemiological equivalent of winning a championship pot.
A new report today sheds light on the origins of H7N9. The virus, which jumps from chickens to humans, has killed around a third of the 134 known human cases since it was identified in April. H7N9 has also shown some capacity to spread from person to person. It has rightly put the global health community on alert.
Nathan Wolfe
Oliver Pybus
Today's report shows that H7N9 came about through repeated shuffling of influenza viruses present in wild birds and domestic ducks and chickens. It also documents the existence of a previously unidentified virus spreading in chickens.
The new virus, an H7N7, shares much in common with H7N9. And experiments on ferrets, the standard mammal model for influenza, suggest that like H7N9 it may have the capacity to infect humans. This means that undiscovered human cases of the H7N7 may exist, and with additional shuffles and further mutation this virus's offspring could also represent a global health concern.
In today's world the fight against epidemics like influenza overwhelmingly involves chasing the viruses that have already begun to spread in people. The argument is that given all of the potential viruses and mutations that could lead to the next big one, attempting to predict or prevent it is a fool's errand. It's increasingly clear that argument is wrong.
Influenza epidemics are anything but random. The origins of H7N9 and H7N7 tell a specific story of transmission from wild birds to ducks and eventually chickens and people.
Because chickens are so numerous -- at 19 billion their numbers dwarf other domestic animals -- and commonly sold live in some places, viruses that can spread efficiently in our favorite consumable bird increase their opportunity to make that fateful jump into people. And because wild birds, the ultimate origin of all influenza viruses, share close connections with domestic ducks, from whom the H and N genes jumped, these ducks become an important stepping stone for new viruses.
Even what's absent in the viruses' genes themselves tell us something useful. The N genes in both the new H7N9 and H7N7 viruses contain remarkably similar deletions of genetic material -- modifications not seen in their duck virus ancestors. The independent occurrence of such deletions strongly suggests that the deleted region is critical to proliferation in chickens.
While still emerging, the story of H7N9 and H7N7 suggest highly practical recommendations. Ducks could help create the next pandemic influenza, so monitor them closely and consider ways to keep them separate from wild birds and other domestic animals.
As humans working alongside domestic birds will likely be hit first, monitor these sentinel populations, particularly in regions with novel types of avian influenza. Track the genetic geography of influenza during the process of its emergence as it moves between locations and wild and domestic animal hosts, because some genes will have a higher chance of successfully spilling over.
Together these steps will permit us to monitor the viruses we have most to fear from and optimize control measures, like the usefully deployed, but costly, closure of poultry markets.
Increasingly these recommendations are being heeded. The study released today represents part of a larger global effort to take stock of the viruses that can infect us, to document where they reside and to catch them when they spill over.
Governments, academic institutions, nonprofits and even a fledgling but rapidly growing private sector are working together in an unprecedented way to address a problem that increasingly threatens our globally interconnected world.
Together with our Chinese colleagues at the Guangdong Institute of Public Health, for example, we work to monitor new influenza and other viruses among people working in markets and other environments in precisely the regions where these viruses are emerging. The work represents a partnership with USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats Predict program, which supports these and other similar activities throughout the viral hotspots of the world.
The work is just beginning. Together with novel digital tools like monitoring internet search patterns and social media for signs of new epidemics, we are adding to a growing arsenal of approaches to catch epidemics and stop them before they become pandemics. In an increasingly interconnected world, where new epidemic threats surround us, it is time we elevate prediction and prevention of epidemics to a central element of global health.
A poker player may not be able to predict exactly when a royal flush will appear, but whoever is counting the cards and tracking the hands will always win in the end.

AS FOR TAN, LEONORA de Jesus, the president's chief of staff, insists that Estrada is demonstrating his independence by criticizing the government's tax case against the man. Tan's bad crony image is to Estrada "not an issue" because Erap himself has been similarly maligned by the media. Salonga asserts that both Tan and Cojuangco were "heavy financiers" of Estrada's presidential campaign, and the president has "a very keen sense of gratitude." This trait, says Salonga, is "part of our culture as a people." Neither Tan nor Cojuangco show up on the official list of Estrada's contributors. However, Cojuangco's brother Henry and a long-time business associate of Tan's, Ramon Lee, did give significant amounts. One businessman who used to work in government and says he understands how one hand washes the other in Manila, says Estrada has an abiding sense of gratitude toward the people who helped him get elected: "That's the character of the president. He owes you. He gives his word. He honors it." Where does gratitude stop and cronyism begin? For the above businessman, who voted against Estrada and asked not to be named, the gratitude will stop when it runs up against an issue that has been at the heart of Estrada's popularity: fair treatment for the poor. "I think he's very sincere about doing something for them," says the businessman. "If there's a real, real conflict between helping the poor and his friends and benefactors, I think he'll help the poor." Such words are music to the ears of Estrada's people. Says de Jesus: "[Estrada will] always decide for the greater good of the greater number."
But Estrada's administration may be developing a disturbing habit of saying one thing while doing another. Take the government's recently announced measures to grow revenues, which include a plan by Bureau of Internal Revenue Commissioner Beethoven Rualo to make the poor cough up taxes. Estrada critics are sure to have a field day pointing out that Rualo seems to find it easier to tax the poor than the rich. It was the revenue chief, after all, who last week reduced a $200 million tax bill for Tan in 1992 to $133,000. The bureau justified the action by claiming the tax evasion case against Tan was weak.
Not to say this puts Estrada in Marcos's league. Imelda recently broke a 12-year silence to provide some insight into how her late husband systematically bought up vital industries using the likes of Tan and Cojuangco as "trustees" ñ to help the poor and employ many people, she said. In an exclusive interview with the Philippine Daily Inquirer, she boasted how her husband raised Tan, a mere "bottle pedlar," to wealth and power. In all, she claimed personal ownership of nearly $13 billion in assets including major stakes in 150 Philippine blue-chip firms, half of them publicly listed.
The stock market has already discounted the ill-effects of cronyism, says stock analyst Ed Bancod of Paribas Asia Equity (Philippines) Inc. "I'm not worried. It never left us in the first place. What's different now is you have a democratic institution that one way or the other mitigates the excesses of its officials," he says. Political analyst Amando Doronila agrees: "It's not as brazen as in Marcos's time when he had dictatorial powers. Today, the areas for cronyism are more restricted than before because government does not have the power to award selective empires."
On the other hand, an owner of a medium-size firm, who asked not to be identified, says he is postponing a planned expansion because he is worried Estrada's cronies will corner most of the action. Doronila suggests that cronyism brings "a general demoralization in the business community." The president may at least be guilty of ignoring the troubling signals his actions give off. In October, Estrada was photographed sharing his limousine with Tan. Two months later, he cited the tax case against Tan as proof that he didn't have cronies. Shortly after, he said he wanted to drop the case. Since then, Estrada has hailed Tan a "hero" for "losing" $650,000 a day to keep the troubled national flag carrier, Philippine Airlines, flying. Responds one cynic: "If that's your criterion, you'll have an overcrowded constellation of heroes." It seems faith and trust in government have been early victims of the Estrada administration.

FEATURES HOME WEB-ONLY EXCLUSIVE Is Vajpayee Really Ill? The Indian Prime Minister's apparent health problems are causing alarm -- not to mention speculation

China once again throws the ball back in Taiwan's court  'A Moment of Dignity and Hope': ROC President Chen Shui-bian's inauguration speech Years ago, when a group of TIME editors met with former Indian Prime Minister Deve Gowda, they had a rather unusual experience: The leader of the world's largest democracy seemed to fall asleep mid-conversation. When the final question during the halting interview was asked -- "Prime Minister, what is your government's policy regarding liberalization?" -- for once, the pause was not particularly long. But the answer, when it came, surprised all. The Prime Minister burped.
The current Prime Minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, is not lacking either in social skills or in erudition. He is a great orator, he's witty and is renowned for taking firm decisions. Indians, however, are a little unsettled about him these days. First, Prime Minister Vajpayee noticeably stumbled after delivering the annual Independence Day speech in August and had to be helped by his bodyguards. Then he left early from his party gathering because his doctors had advised him to rest.
But it was his cutting short his visit to the United States -- just as everyone had started celebrating the thaw in Indo-American ties -- that got tongues wagging. Whispers began: prostrate cancer, a collapsing kidney, something unidentified but fatal... No one was buying the statements from the Prime Minister's office that Vajapyee suffered from osteoarthritis in the knees, which had led to the Independence Day lurching.
Before leaving for the U.S., the Prime Minister talked to leading editors and assured them of his good health. But the grumbling has not stopped. He has cut short his trip by a couple of days, snipping off a visit to Silicon Valley to meet with Indian millionaire geeks, much to the disappointment of all those who believe that information technology is the ticket to zero fiscal deficit and high growth.
There is an even greater cause of concern. The 'who-is-on-my-side' game that India and Pakistan play at every international meet is also under threat. The Indian Prime Minister may have been honored with an opportunity to address Congress, but Pakistan's robust ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, will meet many more heads of nations and without a doubt will push the Kashmir issue.
Prime Minister Vajpayee told the weekly India Today that his visit was not going to "lead to a dramatic breakthrough" to Indo-US ties, but would "give a new momentum." The magazine assured its readers that he was up to the job. Arrows leading from his body stated his heart was "in excellent condition," his kidney (he has only one) has "managed fine" and that his brain "remains sharp and alert." The Prime Minister has a pulse rate of 72 and near-perfect blood pressure at 80/130.
This Prime Minister, it seems, is doing great.
