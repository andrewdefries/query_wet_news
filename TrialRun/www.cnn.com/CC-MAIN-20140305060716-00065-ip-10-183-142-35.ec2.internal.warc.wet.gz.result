Obama: Health care reform means changes in treatment for the better Story Highlights President Obama says health care reform central to rebuilding economy In primetime press conference, Obama says reform will not add to deficit Obama chides opponents for reducing health care reform to "politics" Americans "cannot afford to wait for reform any longer," Obama saysNext Article in Politics » Read VIDEOSIDE-BY-SIDE WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama said Wednesday he was unable to guarantee that health care reform won't change how Americans get medical treatment, but he said any changes would be necessary and positive. President Obama is urging Congress to move quickly to pass comprehensive health care reform. In a nationally televised news conference dominated by the health care issue, Obama delivered lengthy statements in response to Republican attacks on proposals he favors. He also attempted to ease the concerns of people left confused by the fierce debate in Washington. He repeatedly emphasized that the spiraling costs of the current system would bankrupt the nation while denying coverage to millions more Americans. Asked directly if he could guarantee that an overhauled health care system won't change how people receive treatment, Obama said no. "The whole point of this is to try to encourage what works," Obama said, addressing concerns that reform would take away the ability of people to choose their doctors and treatment. Watch Obama describe importance of "getting it right" » "The government is already making some of these decisions," Obama said. "Insurance companies are making some of these decisions." The reform proposals he backs would have experts make decisions based on the best medical treatment, not accountants attempting to save money or doctors prescribing treatments that bring the highest fees, Obama said. "This will require patients ... to be more discriminating consumers," he said. "I think that's a good thing. Ultimately ... we just can't afford what's happening right now." Watch Obama defend health care reform » Republican opponents of Democratic bills in the House and Senate said earlier that most Americans like the current system, which they said must be made less expensive and more accessible. Obama and Democratic leaders say the problems are deeper and systemic, and the president spent all of his seven-minute opening statement at the 52-minute news conference outlining the challenges and his proposed solutions. "Even as we rescue this economy from a full-blown crisis, we must rebuild it stronger than before -- and health insurance reform is central to that effort," Obama said. "If we do not control these costs, we will not be able to control our deficit. If we do not reform health care, your premiums and out-of-pocket costs will continue to skyrocket," he said. As he laid out the list of benefits that health care reform offers, he dropped a direct reference to a government-funded public health insurance option. Until now, Obama has consistently touted the government-funded public option as competition for private insurers in expanding access to health coverage. It was unclear if Obama changed the wording to avoid a label opposed by Republican supporters, or if he was signaling a policy shift toward a compromise being negotiated by the Senate Finance Committee to have health insurance cooperatives rather than a government-funded public option. Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa told CNN on Wednesday that the Finance Committee was not considering a public option. Later in the news conference, Obama responded to a question about the public option by saying it was intended to "keep the insurance companies honest." Watch Obama take reporters' questions » He noted that some insurance companies recently reported record profits, and said offering a competing government-funded health plan would require private insurers to offer less-expensive coverage. Speaking about the benefits of his plan, he said it would offer "security" and "stability" to sick and healthy Americans. "It will prevent insurance companies from dropping your coverage if you get too sick. It will give you the security of knowing that if you lose your job, move, or change your job, you will still be able to have coverage. It will limit the amount your insurance company can force you to pay for your medical costs out of your own pocket. And it will cover preventive care like check-ups and mammograms that save lives and money," he said. He also said his program would not add to the deficit over the next decade, addressing concerns from Republican opponents and fiscally conservative Democrats over the costs of the program. Watch Obama describe how he plans to pay for health reform » "Already, we have estimated that two-thirds of the cost of reform can be paid for by reallocating money that is simply being wasted in federal health care programs. This includes over $100 billion in unwarranted subsidies that go to insurance companies as part of Medicare -- subsidies that do nothing to improve care for our seniors," he said. Obama also chided opponents of his health care reform push for making the issue purely political. Don't Miss Will Obama's health care plan mirror 1994 Clinton failure?
Gergen: A steep climb for Obama
Abortion complicates health care debate
"I've heard that one Republican strategist told his party that even though they may want to compromise, it's better politics to 'go for the kill.' Another Republican senator said that defeating health reform is about 'breaking' me," he said. "Let me be clear: This isn't about me," Obama said, noting that he and every member of Congress -- including those trying to scuttle health care reform legislation -- "have great health insurance." Instead, he said, the debate is about people lacking health insurance because they can't afford rising costs, get denied due to a pre-existing condition, or lose their jobs. "This debate is not a game for these Americans, and they cannot afford to wait for reform any longer," Obama said. He also confirmed an agreement with fiscally conservative Democrats to create an independent group of doctors and medical experts empowered to eliminate waste and inefficiency in Medicare. Obama said he backed adding such a panel to health care reform legislation. Such a panel could both save money and "ensure the long-term financial health of Medicare," Obama said. So-called "Blue Dog" Democrats questioning the costs of initial health care bills said Obama gave a "verbal agreement" Tuesday to including the independent panel in health care reform legislation. Earlier Wednesday, Obama worked the phones, urging lawmakers to embrace health care reform, White House Communications Director Anita Dunn said Wednesday. It follows the president's Tuesday meeting with Democrats at the White House, dubbed a "serious working session" where "major progress" was made, Dunn said. Officials said Obama will be taking a more hands-on approach with members of Congress in the days and weeks to come regarding the health care debate. White House aides say the administration is concerned about three centers of serious opposition from House Democrats: the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats who are worried about the cost of a public health care plan; the freshmen and other Democrats from high-income districts who are concerned about taxes for high-income Democrats, and the anti-abortion Democrats who are concerned about federal funding going for abortion services, and whether health care providers can opt out of certain procedures. One official said the administration is aware that "if any of these three groups abandon the effort the bill would be impossible to get out of committee, much less pass." Aides say the president and lawmakers also discussed the public option versus a co-op option.

Human rights group notes 'alarming spike' in Iran executionsStory HighlightsWatchdog group reports "no less that 115 executions" in just over 50 daysIranian government representative couldn't immediately be reached for commentMassive protests broke out after legitimacy of presidential vote questionedIran criticized for closing journalists' association, detaining three more journalistsNext Article in World » LONDON, England (CNN) -- There was an "alarming spike" in the number of Iranian executions between the disputed June 12 presidential election and Wednesday's inauguration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for a second term, Amnesty International reported Friday. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in for a second term Wednesday. "In just over 50 days, we recorded no less that 115 executions. That is an average of more than two each day," said Irene Khan, secretary-general of the human rights watchdog. "This represents a significant increase, even compared to the appallingly high rate of executions that has been so long a feature of the human rights scene in Iran," Khan said in Amnesty International's report. A representative of the Iranian government could not immediately be reached for comment. An Iranian state broadcaster recently reported that senior officials had approved the death sentences of 24 drug smugglers who were reportedly hanged in the city of Karaj. That report quoted a wire service story saying that 219 people had been executed in Iran this year. Massive protests broke out when Ahmadinejad's main opposition candidate, Mir Hossein Moussavi, questioned the legitimacy of the vote and accused the government of reporting fraudulent election results. The government is trying more than 100 people arrested after the balloting. Don't Miss Clinton says trial shows Iran 'is afraid of its own people'

In Depth: Iran election fallout
Between January 1 and June 12, Amnesty International said it recorded at least 196 executions, making Iran a global second behind China for the number of such deaths. There were 115 executions between the election and the inauguration. "In recent weeks, world attention has understandably been focused on the Tehran authorities' brutal attempts to suppress the mass and largely peaceful protests," Khan said. "Yet, as these grotesque figures show, there has been no let-up in other long-standing patterns of human rights abuse -- in fact, the reverse." Amnesty International said the true total number of executions is "almost certainly higher," explaining that its numbers come from official Iranian media and other sources. Most of those executed are said to have been convicted of drug smuggling or related offenses. All but two of those executed by hanging are believed to have been men, most of them between 20 and 50 years of age, the organization said. "This is a dreadful situation, and one that is made worse by the fact that all or most of those executed are likely to have been denied fair trials, in gross breach of international law," Khan said. On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the trial of more than 100 people whom Iran has linked to post-election unrest a "sign of weakness" that shows the Islamic republic "is afraid of its own people." "It is a show trial, there's no doubt about it," Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on his "GPS" program Sunday. Also in Iran, free-press advocates are criticizing the nation for closing a journalists' association and detaining three more journalists. Iranian authorities closed the Association of Iranian Journalists this week and arrested three journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement. "The closure of the Association of Iranian Journalists is the latest attempt to intimidate and silence critical journalists," the organization's coordinator for Middle East and North African programs, Mohamed Abdel Dayem, said in a statement. The association was closed Wednesday night, according to the semi-official Iran Labour News Agency, which quoted the association's secretary, Badrolsadat Mofidi. Meanwhile, agents arrested an editor for a newspaper owned by Mehdi Karrubi, an opposition presidential candidate, the committee said. The arrest happened not long after Ahmadinejad was sworn in Wednesday, the organization said. A second journalist who was arrested formerly worked for a news outlet affiliated with Moussavi, the committee said. A third journalist was arrested in Iran this week, though another was freed, it said. At least 38 journalists are behind bars in Iran, making that country the world's leading jailer of journalists, the committee said.

1 dead, 4 critically hurt after Arizona dust storm triggers pileups
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 9:33 PM EDT, Tue October 4, 2011
An Arizona dust storm caused wrecks involving at least 30 cars Tuesday on Interstate 10 north of Tucson, Arizona.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Two suffered critical injuries in chain-reaction incident 20 miles north of Tucson
One person died and two suffered life-threatening injuries in Pichacho Peak incident
The storm caused "minimal visibility" along Interstate 10 north of Tucson
(CNN) -- One person was killed and four critically injured Tuesday in a series of highway pileups triggered by a dense dust storm on Interstate 10 in central Arizona, a state law enforcement official said.
The dust storm moved through the Pichacho Peak area, about 40 miles north of Tucson, at about 12:15 p.m. (3:15 p.m. ET) and caused "minimal visibility" on a stretch of Interstate 10 there, said Bart Graves, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety.
"We have two chain reaction crashes in the westbound lanes," Graves said. "All involve commercial vehicles and passenger cars. There is one confirmed fatality and two additional victims with life-threatening injuries."
Graves said 16 vehicles were involved in the chain reaction accidents at Pichacho Peak.
Dust storm causes multiple accidents
"We closed the eastbound lanes to allow emergency responders access to the scene," he said. "Due to the poor visibility, all patients were transported by ground ambulance to Tucson area hospitals."
"The dust continues to cause a major hindrance to DPS officers and other rescue personnel," Graves said.
Another pileup, this one involving eight vehicles, occurred about an hour and a half later, 20 miles to the south on I-10, Graves said.
Two people were critically injured in that incident, which occurred on the eastbound lanes of I-10.
Graves said he could not estimate when the interstate would reopen in either direction.

What Zimmerman's all-female jury says
By Holly McCammon, Special to CNN updated 5:49 PM EDT, Mon June 24, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
An all-female jury will hear the George Zimmerman case in Florida
Holly McCammon: The gender composition of a jury will not affect the outcome She says research shows that no one juror trait, including gender, can determine the vote McCammon: Public attention to an all-female jury indicates we still think in gendered ways
Editor's note: Holly McCammon is professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University and edits the American Sociological Review. She is the author of "The U.S. Women's Jury Movements and Strategic Adaptation: A More Just Verdict." (CNN) -- Many are speculating whether an all-woman jury is a benefit or detriment to George Zimmerman, who stands accused in a Florida court for murdering Trayvon Martin.
Women jurors are a recent phenomenon in U.S. history. In the 1960s, numerous states still prohibited women jurors. The thinking was that women's place was in the home, not in the jury box. Women's jury service wasn't placed on equal footing with men's until a 1975 U.S. Supreme Court decision (Taylor v. Louisiana).
An earlier Florida case vividly illustrates this history. In the late 1950s, Gwendolyn Hoyt stood trial for murdering her husband with a baseball bat. Hoyt's guilt was determined by an all-male jury because at the time women in Florida had to volunteer for jury duty, while men were required to serve. Few questioned whether a female defendant tried by a jury of men confronted a "jury of her peers."
Holly McCammon
Hoyt and her attorneys, however, did pose the question and appealed the guilty verdict all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that the all-male jury denied her due process. One of Hoyt's attorneys noted that when she asked her male acquaintances whether a man tried by an all-female jury would receive a fair trial, they answered with a resounding "no!"
The 1961 Supreme Court ruling in the Hoyt case upheld a state's right to define women's jury service differently than men's. The court ruled that "woman is still regarded as the center of home and family" and for this reason a woman can "be relieved from the civic duty of jury service."
Times certainly do change. The 1975 Taylor decision overturned Hoyt, and women were able to participate equally in the democratic act of deciding community justice. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled that peremptory challenges could no longer be based on a prospective juror's sex. That is, lawyers could no longer dismiss women (or men) from a jury panel because of their sex. Women have clearly broken the glass ceiling in the courtroom.
But the public's attention to the all-female jury in the George Zimmerman case shows that we are not yet gender blind when it comes to the justice system. Many people ask right away -- how will these women weigh the evidence, deliberate and affect the outcome of the trial?
Zimmerman accepts all-female jury
Jury for Zimmerman trial is all women
The answer is likely to be that the all-female jury will have little or no effect on the ultimate decision in this case. Research shows that no one juror trait, including gender, is an accurate indicator of how a juror will vote. Rather -- and savvy trial lawyers know this -- the best predictor of whether a juror will side with the prosecution or defense is a mix of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, political ideology, personality, attitudes, and so on.
Jury selection experts understand as well how the complex mix is closely tied to the specific issues at stake in a particular trial. Jury composition alone rarely shapes the verdict in a trial. For example, a 2007 review of the scholarship on jury selection reported that the backgrounds and attitudes of jurors predict less than 15% of verdicts.
Women are now full citizens when it comes to jury service. If a man is being tried by an all-woman jury, he is likely being tried by a jury of his peers.

But our public attention to the fact of an all-female jury shows that we are still conditioned to think in gendered ways.
