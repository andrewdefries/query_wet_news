Missing teen's parents help other families copeStory Highlights Jason Jolkowski vanished on June 13, 2001, without cashing paycheck Parents delayed calling police under mistaken belief they had to wait 24 hours Case led to creation of statewide database, national nonprofit group Know something? Call Omaha, Nebraska, Police Department at 402-444-5818 Next Article in Crime » Read VIDEO By Rupa Mikkilineni Nancy Grace Producer	(CNN) -- When their 19-year-old son, Jason, disappeared eight years ago, any concept of a normal life ceased for the Jolkowski family. Jason Jolkowski would be 28 today and might look like the man shown in this photograph. Kelly and Jim Jolkowski and their other son, Michael, believed at first that Jason would walk through the front door of their Omaha, Nebraska, home at any moment. Now, every time a body is found somewhere, the news sets their hearts pounding. To this day, police say they have no evidence of foul play. Nor, they say, do they have any evidence that Jason simply ran away. It is a bona fide mystery. Kelly Jolkowski described her life in an open letter to her missing son a year ago: "We waited and hoped that you'd walk in the door ... and that the whole awful event would be over, but that didn't happen," she wrote. "It feels as if it never may end, and that we may have to wait for our life after this world to see you again." Watch a report on the case » Since shortly after Jason's disappearance, the Jolkowskis have thrown their energy into raising public awareness about what to do when a loved one goes missing. After three years of lobbying, they were able to get a law passed in Nebraska creating a statewide missing persons database. They founded a nonprofit organization called Project Jason, and its Web site tracks missing persons cases across the country. According to the site, Project Jason has distributed some 50,000 missing persons fliers since 2003. "We feel that some good is coming out of Jason's story," Kelly Jolkowski told CNN. But she said she still hopes to find her son someday. Nancy Grace

The last time anyone who knew him saw him, Jason Jolkowski was bringing the empty trash cans in from the curb. That was June 13, 2001. Since then, his cell phone has fallen silent and his bank account hasn't been touched. His last paycheck was never cashed. Jason was 19 and attending community college part time. He had a job at a restaurant and wanted to be a disc jockey. On the day he disappeared, Jason and his younger brother, Michael, were on summer break from school. Their parents were at work, and the boys were home alone. Jason worked at a restaurant called Fazoli's. His boss had called him that morning and asked him to come into work on his day off. Jason's car was at the mechanic's shop, so his boss arranged a ride for him with a co-worker. She and Jason were to meet at a high school parking lot that was within walking distance from the Jolkowskis' home. Don't Miss More on Project Jason

According to his mother, Jason had walked that seven-block route before. It took him along quiet, residential streets with little pedestrian or vehicle traffic. Jason was last seen at 10:15 that morning, standing at the end of his driveway. Less than an hour later, his boss called and spoke with Michael, complaining that Jason had not shown up for work and had never arrived at the high school to meet his ride. His parents arrived home from work to learn that Jason had been missing all day. They called Jason's friends. None of them had seen or heard from him that day. "Jason was a quiet boy," his mother said. "He only had a small handful of friends. He was shy." Jason did not have a girlfriend and was not the sort of person to take risks, like hitching a ride with a complete stranger, his mother insisted. His parents called police the next morning. Like so many people, the Jolkowskis mistakenly believed there was a 24-hour wait before police would accept a missing person's report. "And then it took at least another 10 days before police took Jason's disappearance seriously," Kelly Jolkowski said. "They assumed this was a typical teen runaway scenario." But according to the family, Jason did not have a history of running away and was not a troubled teen. He had no reason to run off. From the beginning, his family feared an accident or abduction. Police began to interview neighbors and conducted searches 10 days after his disappearance, but valuable time had been lost, Kelly Jolkowski said. "We'd have liked to see more activity in the first crucial hours, but we do feel they stepped up to the plate to do all they could and in the end, they did a proper investigation," the Jolkowskis said in a prepared statement. "We were pleased by the meetings they had with us, following up on any leads, talking to his friends, checking the computer and conducting interviews." Despite mounted searches, ground searches, a helicopter and the use of infrared technology, there was no sign of Jason or any clues to his whereabouts. The family is not certain whether dogs were brought to track the route between the Jolkowski home and the high school. But his mother said she believes that if police had any evidence, they would have shared it with the family. Detective Jim Shields of the Omaha Police Department said the case remains an open and active investigation. "I know his parents have expressed concern about how the investigation was handled in the beginning," he said, "but in missing adult cases, often we wait a few days because adults have the right to come and go freely." Police said they have no clues or evidence in the case. It is categorized as a missing person's case, and authorities have no evidence suggesting Jason is no longer alive. "We simply don't know and really hope for more tips," Shields said. At the time he went missing, Jason would have only had about $60 on him, his mother said. She speculated in her open letter about what his life might be like now. "If you are still with us, you could be married and have children. You may have graduated from college and be pursuing a career," she wrote. "So many life events which normally happen with someone of your age may have passed by. We hope and pray that you haven't been cheated of the life you were meant to live." Jason Jolkowski is described as 6 feet 1 inch and 165 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a Chicago Cubs T-shirt, black dress pants and black dress shoes. Anyone with information leading to his whereabouts is asked to call the Omaha police at 402-444-5818.

London (CNN) -- In the years leading up to 2011, several celebrities, royals and politicians had claimed to have had their phones hacked by News of The World. The paper's royal editor and a private investigator had even been convicted of intercepting phone messages and spent time in prison. The story was covered on the inside pages of selected newspapers but failed to really capture the British public's attention.
That all changed in July of that year when the Guardian reported that police suspected the cellphone of murdered teenager Milly Dowler had been hacked by News of the World and that messages had been deleted to free up space for new voicemail.
The allegations sparked outrage: amid condemnation from politicians on all sides of the spectrum, the paper's boss Rupert Murdoch closed down the 168-year-old tabloid newspaper and paid Dowler's parents and charities more than $4 million in compensation. At a parliamentary inquiry into the allegations, Murdoch declared: "This is the most humble day of my life."

Leveson Inquiry: What key players said
UK media ethics: What will Leveson Report recommend?
When Milly's parents appeared at the Leveson Inquiry set up by the government to investigate press ethics, they gave a raw assessment of the false hope that the deletion of messages had raised in the days after their daughter's disappearance in March 2002.
"I rang her phone," recalled Sally Dowler. "It clicked through on to her voicemail, so I heard her voice and it was just like, 'she's picked up her voicemail, she's alive.'"
Tragically, those hopes were dashed and six months later Milly's body was found in woodland in Hampshire in southern England. Although it was suspected that the deletion of the messages hampered the police investigation, the truth may have been more prosaic: later that year a lawyer acting for the country's biggest force, the Metropolitan Police, said there was no evidence News of the World had been responsible for deleting the messages. The Guardian issued a clarification, but the damage had been done to News of the World and Murdoch's reputation.
Whatever took place, the fact remains that it took police nine years to bring nightclub bouncer Levi Bellfield to justice. In June 2011 he was found guilty of murdering Milly Dowler and sentenced to life imprisonment. During the trial the jury was told Bellfield had previously murdered two other women and attempted to kill a fourth.
So who was the girl whose murder in a quiet suburb of southwest London led to the closure of the UK's top-selling paper, suspicions of collusion between police officers and journalists, and at one time even threatened to topple Murdoch from the media group he had led for half a century? The scandal also led to charges being brought against several Murdoch employees, including two of Prime Minister David Cameron's friends.
Press dishes it out, but can it take it?
She would always be trying to make people laugh, joking and smilingDanielle Sykes
Despite her extraordinary legacy, by most accounts Amanda Dowler, who was known as Milly, was a normal, bright 13-year-old schoolgirl who had a good relationship with her parents and elder sister Gemma. Her friends testified during Bellfield's trial in London that she had a sunny personality and was her normal self on the day of her disappearance.
"She was one of the funniest people I had ever met," Danielle Sykes said in a statement. "She would always be trying to make people laugh, joking and smiling.
"She was one of those sort of people that when she was happy she was exceptionally happy, an infectious personality. If she was sad about something she would be particularly sad and get upset. She valued her friendships and family a lot."
Sykes, who was one of the last people to see Milly alive, said she ate chips with her friend in a café in Walton-on-Thames after school. "We parted and I gave her a hug and asked if she would be alright walking home on her own and she said, 'Yeah, I'll be absolutely fine.'
"I then turned around and shouted back at her 'I would not tell anyone what we had been talking about.'"
I don't think it's as simple as the fact that Milly Dowler's phone was hacked and that led to the end of the News of the World. I think there are more layers to the story than that, and we may never know what actually happenedGeoffrey Wansell
Sykes added that they had been discussing a boy whom Milly fancied.
After the friends parted, Milly started to walk to her home nearby, but was snatched by Bellfield as she walked along a road.
Milly's sister also told the court she knew instinctively something was wrong when she returned home to find the house empty. She said: "I knew Milly wouldn't go out without telling Mum or Dad. I rang Milly's mobile. It was switched off so I left a message on her answer phone telling her to come home because Dad was really annoyed.
"I was worried because Milly would always ring to tell us she was going to be late. It was so unusual for her not to be home on time. I knew instinctively something bad had happened to Milly and that she had been abducted."
Milly's disappearance sparked a nationwide search involving more than 100 police officers and a reconstruction of her last movements on the TV program "Crimewatch." Detectives from Surrey police however suggested she had not been taken by force and had run away.
Some friends indeed portrayed a different side to Milly, suggesting she had been "distressed" at the time of disappearance, after finding bondage pornography belonging to her father Robert. Police initially considered him a suspect, but later apologized.
In a statement read to the court, Jacqueline Pignolly said: "Milly told me some pornographic magazines had been found in her Dad's drawer.
"At the time Milly was a bit upset about it, not much for herself but her mum. I know that Milly did see them and there was more than one of them."
During the trial Bellfield's lawyers used this testimony, along with a "goodbye" note that Milly had written to her parents and a poem in which she said "I hate myself," to paint a picture of the teenager as unhappy and distressed. His tactics caused great distress to the family, but the jury failed to believe his plea of innocence.
Geoffrey Wansell, the author of a book on Bellfield, "The Bus Stop Killer," told CNN that in the wake of the 2011 trial, during which the Dowlers were pilloried by the tabloids over the pornography revelations, the family grew to loathe the press. It was in this atmosphere that the revelation was made about the hacking of Milly's phone, which became, according to Wansell, "the defining moment from which News of the World could not recover."
"I don't think it's as simple as the fact that Milly Dowler's phone was hacked and that led to the end of the News of the World. I think there are more layers to the story than that, and we may never know what actually happened."

Thandie Newton joins women's protest, recalls exploitation
By CNN Staff
updated 7:20 AM EST, Fri February 15, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Actress is part One Billion Rising campaign to raise awareness of violence against women She recalled being exploited early in her career
(CNN) -- British actress Thandie Newton, who joined crowds of demonstrators in London on Thursday to protest violence against women, said she knows the feeling of exploitation and humiliation from the "kinds of things I was expected to do in auditions."
Newton recalled one incident as a teen, when she was exploited in a "casting couch" style interview, which she said many young actors can be forced to endure.
"There was one horrific incident where I went back for a second audition," she said. "The director asked me to sit with my legs apart; the camera was right positioned where it could see up my skirt."
Newton said the director told her to "put my leg over the arm of the chair, and before I started my dialogue, think about the character I was supposed to be having the dialogue with and how it felt to be made love to by this person."
Three years later, Newton -- who was then married -- learned from a conversation with a producer at Cannes Film Festival in France that the director had used the video to entertain guests during late-night parties.
The London native has since starred in such films as "The Pursuit of Happyness" and "Mission Impossible II."
On Thursday, she was apart of the throngs outside Parliament in support of a campaign called One Billion Rising that seeks to raise awareness of the attacks that women routinely confront.
CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.

'Buckwild' star, two others died of carbon monoxide poisoning
By CNN Staff
updated 9:37 AM EDT, Wed April 3, 2013
"MasterChef" runner-up Joshua Marks was in "the battle of his life fighting mental illness" when he killed himself on October 11, his family said.
Gia Allemand appeared on Season 14 of ABC's "The Bachelor." In a statement, her family said the 29-year-old's death apparently was suicide.
Shain Gandee of MTV's "Buckwild" was found dead in April in Kanawha County, West Virginia, authorities said. The body of Gandee, 21, was discovered in a vehicle along with the bodies of his uncle, David Dwight Gandee, 48, and Donald Robert Myers, 27.
Jennifer Lyon, who appeared on "Survivor: Palau" in 2005, died at her home in Oregon in January 2010. The 37-year-old was diagnosed with breast cancer after her stint on the reality show.
"The Real World: Hollywood" cast member Joey Kovar died of a suspected drug overdose in August 2012 at 29. Kovar also appeared on the third season of "Celebrity Rehab."
"Swamp People" star Mitchell Guist, right, died in Louisiana in May 2012. He was working to build a houseboat when he appeared to have a seizure and fell backward in his boat, said Assumption Parish Sheriff Mike Waguespack. Another person, who did not want to be identified, performed CPR and called 911.
In 1994's "The Real World: San Francisco," cast member Pedro Zamora shared his struggle with HIV/AIDS. After Zamora died in November 1994, President Bill Clinton said the Cuban-born reality star "changed the face of HIV and AIDS in America forever."
"Deadliest Catch's" Capt. Phil Harris died in February 2010 at 53. The reality star was hospitalized after he suffered a stroke on January 29.
Rachel Brown, a 2006 contestant on "Hell's Kitchen," which is hosted by Gordon Ramsay, was found dead of a gunshot wound in her Dallas home in 2007. The Tarrant County medical examiner's office said Brown's death was ruled a suicide.
"Jackass" star Ryan Dunn was drunk and speeding up to 140 mph when his 2007 Porsche 911 GT3 crashed and caught fire on a Pennsylvania highway in June 2011, police said. The 34-year-old died from "blunt and thermal trauma" in the fiery crash, according to the autopsy report.
Frankie Abernathy was a cast member on "The Real World: San Diego," which aired on MTV in 2004. Abernathy, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive track, was 25 when she died in June 2007.
New Jersey restaurant owner Joseph Cerniglia, who appeared on the first season of "Kitchen Nightmares," jumped from a bridge into New York's Hudson River in September 2010. The medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.
Russell Armstrong, left, hanged himself in 2011 while appearing on Bravo's "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills." The series featured his estranged wife, Taylor, grappling with the aftermath of his suicide.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Shain Gandee was one of nine cast members of the MTV reality show "Buckwild"
He was found dead along with two other men outside Sissonville, West Virginia
The deaths were labeled as accidental, according to preliminary autopsy findings
"This is the emptiest I've ever felt," a fellow cast member tweets
(CNN) -- Shain Gandee, one of the stars of the MTV reality show "Buckwild," and two other people died of carbon monoxide poisoning, the sheriff's office in Kanawha County, West Virginia, said Tuesday.
The deaths, discovered Monday, were labeled as accidental, according to preliminary findings from an autopsy report.
Gandee, 21, was found dead in a vehicle along with his uncle, David Dwight Gandee, 48, and Donald Robert Myers, 27, authorities said.
"This is a very sad and tragic event," Kanawha County Commissioner Kent Carper said Monday. "We live in a very small community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Gandee family."
MTV reality star Shain Gandee found dead
On Monday, the sheriff's office said they had "received word of a disabled vehicle in a wooded area" near Sissonville, that deputies and Sissonville Volunteer Fire Department personnel used all-terrain vehicles to reach the 1984 Ford Bronco belonging to the Gandee family.
Inside the MTV show 'Buckwild'
"Inside were the bodies of three people," the sheriff's office statement said.
Later, the sheriff's office said the vehicle was partially submerged in mud. It was uneven but upright; its muffler was below the surface. Mud covered the lower part of the Bronco's passenger side door, but the driver's side, where the younger Gandee sat, was free.
Shain Gandee was one of the nine cast members of "Buckwild." The show follows a group of young adults trying to have fun in Sissonville, pulling stunts such as turning a dump truck into a swimming pool or just riding around the woods on their ATVs. Gandee was billed as a former high school prom king who had done "every job from coal mining to being a garbage man."
MTV released a statement about Gandee: "We are shocked and saddened by the terrible news about Shain Gandee, and those involved in this tragic incident. We are waiting for more information but at this time, our main concern is for the Gandee family and their friends. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. Shain had a magnetic personality, with a passion for life that touched everyone he met and we will miss him dearly."
Some of Gandee's fellow cast members took to social media to express their feelings.
"RIP Shain Gandee," Ashley Whitt tweeted. "You were the most amazing person I've ever known. I know you will be watching over ..."
"This is the emptiest I've ever felt," Cara Parrish tweeted. "Please pray for Dale and Loretta [Gandee's parents]."
"Buckwild" has been compared to MTV's reality show "Jersey Shore," and on Monday, one of that show's stars, Jenni "JWoww" Farley, tweeted, "That's awful that shain passed... He was just a baby. Rip. #Buckwild."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Iranian cartoonists satirizing political system face great pressure
Book of Iranian political cartoonists' work published to honor their role in society
Satire used when straightforward expression is difficult or suppressed
More satirists and comedians appearing across the region, says U.S. Arabic comedian Dean Obeidallah
(CNN) -- In 2003, former newspaper editor Ali Reza Eshraghi made a mistake that cost him his freedom: he published a cartoon.
The sketch in question, a drawing from 1937 depicting U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt's pressure on the U.S. Supreme Court, seemed an innocuous choice for the Iranian newspaper, Hayat No.
But Iran's Special Court for the Clergy disagreed. According to Reporters Without Borders it ruled that that the cartoon's depiction of Roosevelt looked suspiciously like the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini and was insulting to his memory.
The court shut down Hayat No, and Eshraghi spent nearly two months in prison.
Backstage at Iraq's hottest TV talk show
A decade later, Eshraghi's friend and former colleague, journalist Omid Memarian, decided to honor the pressures placed on satirists in a book entitled, "Sketches of Iran: A Glimpse from the Front Lines of Human Rights."
The book, published in January by the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, was informed by Memarian's conviction that political cartoons played a unique role in his country's struggle for democracy.
Political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions.Omid Memarian
"Over the past ten years I've been working as a journalist both in Iran and out of Iran, and I've seen political cartoons have a very strong impact on political discussions and social discussions," he explained.
"Cartoons communicate with a much wider audience, with different layers of society, with people from different social economic class, with different levels of education."

Shirin Ebadi, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning lawyer, notes in her forward to the book that decades of censorship have also meant that the subtle, tongue-in-cheek wit of cartoonists takes on special power, writing that "a society stricken by years of authoritarian rule cannot express itself and its pains in a straightforward manner."
Satire has long been used as a powerful medium for veiled political commentary and political cartoons became a favorite medium for poking fun at authorities. The satirical magazine "Molla Nasreddin," an Azeri language periodical published between 1906 and 1930 enjoyed a wide readership across the Middle East.
The scope for public expression has become much wider; people feel much more empowered. Lina Khatib, director of the Arab Reform and Democracy Program at Stanford University
Its main character, a bumbling and backwards cleric often depicted in compromising scenarios, resonated with countries grappling with the thorny issue of modernization -- particularly Iran, where Molla Nasreddin's first year of publication coincided with the Constitutional Revolution, an attempt to reform Iran's monarchy.
The country's first experiment with liberal democracy was ended in 1907, but Molla Nasreddin's jokes lived on inspiring future generations of artists who have used political cartoons to offer subtle social commentary for decades.
"The reasons cartoons... have a very strong presence in Iranian culture is that in some of these cycles of oppression journalists or authors could not write. But cartoonists might find ways to express an idea or in a very delicate way," said Memarian.
Memarian believes cartoons have a unique ability to capture complex political problems in a succinct and visually powerful way, making them universally appealing.

Now, the dynamics of the Arab Spring have bred a new cartoon culture that has moved away from understated critique to direct assaults on authoritarnism.
"The scope for public expression has become much wider" said Lina Khatib, director of the Arab Reform and Democracy Program at Stanford University. "People feel much more empowered in being able to express how they feel about autocracy without the fear which used to force them to opt for subtlety."
Tarek Shahin, author of the graphic novel "Rise: the Story of the Egyptian Revolution as Told Shortly Before It Began," agrees.
"As recently as three years ago just the fact that I wrote about politics and other social taboos had many of my friends and family worried about my safety and theirs by association," said Shahin. "Today you can't keep up with all the political jokes, be they cartoons, internet memes or street graffiti."

Self-expression is finding new forms, too. Dean Obeidallah, founder of the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival and a stand-up comedian who conducts workshops in the Middle East, said he has witnessed an explosion in the number of local comics in the region.
But in Iran, according to Omid Memarian, many humorists have been forced to leave the country.
"Over the past seven to eight years, particularly over the past four years, many cartoonists -- like journalists -- have fled the country and live abroad," he said.
"They are under constant pressure to make sure their cartoons do not become a reason to harm the newspaper...There have been newspaper that have been shut down just for having a controversial cartoon."
Nonetheless, cartoonists in Iran are drawing on their creativity to evade censorship, which Memarian insists makes their work even more powerful.
"We're seeing actions become more ambiguous, more general, more interpretative," he said.
"(But) the process of decoding a message is more attractive. It's more appealing, more beautiful."

Egyptian demonstrator: Why we are willing to die
updated 10:16 AM EDT, Mon August 19, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The author says he voted for Morsy but is not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood
Most protesters are young people who are looking for a good future, he writes
He says: The protesters say that they will never give up until we have freedom and victory.
Editor's note: The author says he voted for President Mohamed Morsy but is not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He is a single man in his 20s who lives in Cairo with his parents, brothers and sisters. He asked us not to use his name because he says this would put him in danger.
Cairo (CNN) -- Cairo -- I write this after several days that have disheartened me and many Egyptian people. Many Egyptians desire freedom and a better life, and we love democracy. Imagine standing in long lines under the sun, waiting to give your vote for a new leader and then you wake up and he is no longer president?
CNN iReport: Cairo is not all on fire Egyptians do not want to live as slaves anymore, and we are extremely discouraged. Most of our people who peacefully protested are young people who are looking for a good future and a good life as you have in the West. Egyptians are hopeful, but unfortunately we now face guns and many have been killed.
Opinion: Egypt's identity torn in two Since the coup, many days have been bloody and the army has been extremely violent. The large-scale murders have angered and horrified many Egyptians. We were so happy to have a civilian president for the first time: a person who would put Egypt in his heart and stop corruption and not steal from us, but now we feel hopeless and desperate about the future of Egypt.

Mosque siege ends in Cairo
Egypt struggles with violence, bloodshed
We love peace, we do not hurt anybody, we protect all churches, and we love Egypt more than ourselves. We want to see Egypt grow as a good country. We hope that the world understands that most Egyptians are against violence. That is why people here refused to create a civil war.
We have not been armed during our protest which has been very peaceful until the army fired upon us. We hate to see blood and that is why what we witnessed by the Egyptian army is unprecedented, we have never seen such massacres before in Egypt. All of Egypt is in shock.
I saw no protesters with guns, only sticks and stones to defend themselves. As to the burning of churches, this is something that is strictly forbidden for any Muslim and I believe is most likely to have been done by fanatics or criminals, who are taking advantage of the unrest.
Opinion: Why U.S. hasn't cut aid to Egypt
The anti-coup group is a coalition of groups including democrats, unions, a wide range of religious groups, students and political groups -- and is comprised of hundreds of thousands of people. Many here want everybody to respect democracy and if they want to change Mohamed Morsy as the leader, then we believe it should be by election like in every other democracy. For me, the main issue is not about Morsy himself, this is a battle for democracy, respect, and justice. The fact remains Morsy won an election by a significant majority and he did so through a democratic process and they deserve to serve their term of office. I believe democracy cannot begin if it is strangled at birth.
Unemployment is very high in Egypt, and there is no way to earn money, so life is very hard. Universities have closed programs and Egyptians have fewer options. I lost my job and began studying languages to improve my skills but now my classes have been suspended.
Walking down city streets is not safe, and young people do not look forward to a good future in Egypt. Most of our people here are so sad from witnessing the killing of so many sons, daughters, and friends. We do not have many fanatical people in Egypt. Most people live together in peace even from different religions and backgrounds.
On Saturday we buried a friend who was killed in the protests. We went to put him in his tomb, but before that we walked and carried him through the streets until we reached his tomb. There were so many people with us and people carried his photo and many slogans saying we will never give up until we make his dream come true: Democracy for Egypt!
After we protested on Sunday, many people walked to his home and met his mom and family. His mom was crying and we promised her we would never give up until we get this justice.
Now we feel that we are in the darkest days. Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow but the protesters say that they will never give up until we have freedom and victory. We are willing to die for our freedom! The world is our witness.
