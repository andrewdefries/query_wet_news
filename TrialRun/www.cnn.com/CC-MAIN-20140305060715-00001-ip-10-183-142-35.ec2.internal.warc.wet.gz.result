(CNN) -- Investigators on Monday were examining two fires in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to determine whether they were set intentionally and, if so, whether they are related to a series of fires set at churches elsewhere in the state.The first blaze, early Friday, was at the Wesley Foundation Methodist student center on the University of Alabama campus, in the western part of the state. The second, late Friday, was at a Tuscaloosa warehouse that stored merchandise for a business that prints and sells religious articles, among other items.Neither blaze had been ruled arson Monday by the team of local, state and federal investigators, officials said.The warehouse fire broke out about 11:50 p.m. Friday, said Tuscaloosa Police Chief Ken Swindle. Authorities have no suspects, he said, but would like to talk to a man who witnesses reported was videotaping the blaze.Jim Cavanaugh of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said a national response team will be investigating the warehouse fire and will determine whether it is related to the church fires. (Watch Cavanaugh discuss the fires -- 5:13)"This one, right now, I don't feel like it's related, but I can't say for sure. I don't know," he said. "Fires happen a lot. If this was an average day in Tuscaloosa, there'd be a fire. What happens is, when you have a series of events ... everybody's radar is up."Authorities earlier had said the student center fire could be accidental, but the cause Monday remained undetermined pending tests conducted Sunday, said Ragan Ingram, assistant commissioner of insurance for the Alabama Department of Insurance, which includes the state fire marshal's office. Investigators are looking into the possibility the fire was started by candles, he said. A candlelight vigil was held there in the hours before the blaze began.Investigators have ruled that an attempted arson early Sunday, at a Church of God near the east Alabama community of Glencoe, was unrelated to the other intentionally set fires, Cavanaugh said. That attempt involved two Molotov cocktails thrown at the remote church, resulting in minimal damage."We don't believe it's related," Cavanaugh said. "We believe it's a very localized case, but we're working that heavy, too."Such unrelated fires, he said, serve as a "distraction" to agents investigating the series of church arsons, but "we've got the commanders focused on the mission."The 10 church arsons have all been at Baptist churches. Investigators have not decided whether one of them, which heavily damaged Beaverton Freewill Baptist Church in Lamar County on February 12, is related to the other nine. Cavanaugh noted that, in contrast to the others, it was set during the day.Five of the 10 churches have predominantly black congregations and five, including Beaverton Freewill Baptist, have mainly white members.Asked about the results of lab testing, he said "lots of stuff has come back," but would not elaborate."We feel good about the case," he said. "We've got a lot of leads to chase. This is not 'CSI.' I can't come back in an hour and have everybody wrapped up. It's difficult."This week, ATF agents will be handing out a church security brochure to area houses of worship and will meet with pastors, he said.Cavanaugh earlier said authorities believe the fires are being set by two young men in their 20s or early 30s who are an "inseparable team, always together" and live in western Alabama. They may keep late hours, he said.Authorities also are still looking for a dark SUV witnesses reported seeing at the site of at least one fire, possibly a black Pathfinder, Cavanaugh said."Burning a church is another dimension of crime," he said. "That's why it's important to us. A lot of people who would commit a crime wouldn't burn a church." Story Tools

Food 101: Seeking clues in the kitchen By Stephanie Chen, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ushered by Jamie Oliver and others, there's a push to get Americans back into the kitchen A lot of 20- and 30-somethings have no idea how to cook Food experts: Restaurants, processed foods took a toll on home cooking Food shows and food blogging have become popular in the past decade

Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The curious faces scrutinize the classroom kitchen, where pots and pans dangle from the ceiling and sharp knives glisten on the counter next to heaps of spinach and ripe green peppers. The one-night, hands-on course, called Food 101, is meant for them. They are the cooking inept, who can't properly to chop an onion, let alone sauté a medley of vegetables. First-time student Jessica Clark, 33, of Atlanta, is attending the course offered by Cook's Warehouse because she is dubious of her kitchen abilities. She only knows how to prepare grilled chicken and steamed broccoli (and on some nights canned black beans and rice). Her boyfriend is sick of eating the same thing at home. She is sick of eating out. "I usually make whatever is easy, and I guess that's not much," says Clark, dressed in an apron with her fingers still wet from fumbling through the tomato dicing activity. "I've avoided the kitchen for 33 years." Cooking dinner? There's an app for that From British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to First Lady Michelle Obama, a food revolution is brewing in America, a push to return to the bygone days when healthy home-cooked meals were much more frequent. Despite the efforts to get Americans back into the kitchen, there still exists a group of adults in their 20s and 30s -- like Clark -- who are clueless in the kitchen. Ironically, these 20- and 30-somethings may have stretched their palates while traveling the world and even spend hours watching the cooking shows and "Top Chef," but they are defeated when they enter the kitchen. They don't own cooking utensils in their Tupperware-filled cabinets. They rely on microwaves, restaurants and takeout menus to feed their empty stomachs. Simply put, they cannot cook. "Lots of people think, read and talk about food, but they don't know how to do anything," said Jennifer Berg, head of the Food Studies program at New York University. "There is an incredible disconnect to actually knowing how to do something." I never learned to cook No one tracks precisely how many young noncookers exist, but it's easy to find them. Just ask anyone between the ages of 20 and 40, and they will shrug and say either they can't cook -- or point to a friend who can't make anything. Lots of people think, read and talk about food. There is an incredible disconnect to actually knowing how to do something.--Jennifer Berg
They come with plenty of excuses for their cooking incompetence: "My friends would rather eat out. ... I don't like cleaning the mess afterwards. ... Cooking for one person is impractical. ... I'm too busy with my job to cook. ... I live in a city with plenty of affordable restaurant options. ... My New York City kitchen is too small." "I couldn't tell if she wanted the big bubbles or little bubbles," says Sharita Robertson of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reflecting back on a time in her early 20s when a friend asked her to boil some eggs. Robertson never had to boil anything before her friend asked her. She admits her mother cooked meals for her growing up, but she doesn't know why she never learned. "I just never had to do any of it," she says. Robertson, now 30, has a 7-year-old daughter, but she rarely prepares anything more complicated than opening a jar of spaghetti sauce and boxed pasta. One time, she tried to fry some chicken, but the attempt ended with a disastrous blister on her leg. Most of the time, her mother cooks for her daughter. Restaurants, processed foods take over At all ages, there are individuals who cannot cook. But NYU food studies expert Jennifer Berg theorizes the group of 20- and 30-somethings can't cook mainly because of a dependence on processed foods that took hold in the 1970s. Greasy snacks, frozen dinners and instant soups flooded the marketplace, replacing traditional home cooking as mothers joined the workplace. During this period, the feminist movement grew stronger, Berg explained. A stigma formed around mothers who cooked meals from scratch. They were labeled domesticated women tied to the household, Berg said. Home economics classes were out, working mothers were in. And so, Berg says a generation of children never learned from their mothers how to cook. Another reason why some people cannot cook, some food experts believe, is that the restaurant culture took hold of the American family. Dual incomes made restaurants more affordable to the growing middle class. In particular, fast food chains such as McDonald, Pizza Hut and Burger King began invading almost every community in America. Nearly half of spending on food in the American family went to "food away from home" in 2008, according to theU.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service. In 1970, about 30 percent of food dollars were spent away from home. "If you have a great food scene and so many affordable options, then you don't need to necessarily be in your own kitchen," said Amy Cao, 26, a food writer who created the AmyBlogsChow.com. "Cooking is no longer a survival tactic." Cao 26, admits on her blog that she cannot cook even though her job is to dine and review restaurants across New York City. Her inability to cook inspired her video series called "Stupidly Simple Snacks" on her blog, where she helps young noncookers learn how to prepare a quick snack. In one of her fast-paced, three-minute online videos, she looks uncomfortable in the kitchen as she teaches her viewers how to make a Greek salad that only requires putting chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and feta cheese in a large mixing bowl. She struggles to use the pepper grinder, and then casually tops the salad with balsamic vinegar and a few pinches of salt. Cao hopes the simple recipe can make cooking less daunting for young folks like herself. The great obesity war Studies have shown that eating out usually consumes more calories than cooking at home, which has complicated the obesity epidemic. About 34 percent of adults in the United States are considered obese, defined as having a BMI 30 or higher, according to the CDC. The obesity epidemic has motivated the food reform efforts by Jamie Oliver and Michelle Obama. "If you don't know how to cook, then you have no options," writes Oliver to CNN. "You're forced into a series of bad choices and a diet of mostly processed foods ... cooking skills are life skills and just as important as knowing how to manage your money." If you don't know how to cook, then you have no options. You're forced into a series of bad choices and a diet of mostly processed foods.--Jamie Oliver
In the March edition of Newsweek, first lady Michelle Obama, who has embarked on the fight against child obesity, wrote about the lack of healthy home cooking. "Back when many of us were growing up, we led lives that kept most of us at a pretty healthy weight," she wrote. "We walked to school every day, ran around at recess and gym and for hours before dinner, and ate home-cooked meals that always seemed to have a vegetable on the plate." A cooking comeback? Some food experts argue a revival of cooking has emerged among the young adults, both male and female, over the last decade. The Internet is loaded with young foodies, blogging and posting about their culinary adventures. The popular Food Netwook will launch the Cooking Channel this month, a trendier sister channel that targets younger audiences. Cao writes on her blog that she's trying to learn to cook for the sake of her health and wallet. Several weeks ago she learned to bake tarragon chicken. It's a recipe that took three times to get right. She mashed the spices into the butter and then coated the chicken breast all by herself. Barbara Fairchild, editor of Bon Appetit magazine, said she's noticed subscriptions jumped among 20- to 30-year-olds over the past few years. "Cooking is hip now," she said. "It's not just for someone with a French accent who is 70 years old and lives in Paris. It's become much more inclusive." Back in the Cook's Warehouse classroom kitchen in Atlanta, there is only one bloody finger by the end of the night from a dicing and chopping exercise. The steam from the freshly made vegetable stock is simmering in the pot. A steak is being seared on a pan in a homemade sauce. The students are eager to enjoy a home-cooked meal. Clark says she is inspired by the course. No more chicken and steamed broccoli. With some basic cooking skills, she's going to throw her friends a dinner party, all from scratch.

17 arrested in Philadelphia drug case
By Kristen Hamill, CNN
updated 8:03 PM EDT, Wed May 30, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Sinaloa drug cartel informer leads to arrests, officials say
Drug unit says it has seized almost $3 million in cocaine
Defendants range in age from early 20s to late 40s, officials say
New York (CNN) -- Seventeen people were arrested in Philadelphia in a multimillion dollar drug bust, with the help of a member of one of the world's largest drug cartels, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office announced Wednesday.
The city's Dangerous Drug Offenders Unit seized almost $3 million worth of cocaine in the bust, as well as 16 vehicles and five guns, after a three-month investigation. Authorities said they were tipped off in February by a confidential informant who said garages and auto body shops in the city were "equipping vehicles with special compartments to traffic drugs." The vehicles would pick up shipments of cocaine in New York and return them to Philadelphia, authorities said.
The District Attorney's office said the arrests Wednesday are a direct result of a series of arrests in September 2011 by the Dangerous Drug Offenders Unit that involved members of the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the largest drug cartels in the world, operating out of Sinaloa and Juarez, Mexico. Authorities said one of the defendants in those arrests became an informant for the unit and helped lead investigators to a garage, and subsequently other garages and auto body shops, involved in the drug ring.
It is unclear if the informant who tipped the police off in February and the Sinaloa Cartel informant are the same person.
"Back in September we announced that we had effectively cut off the head of a dangerous and deadly monster before it ever had a chance of poisoning our streets," said District Attorney Seth Williams. "Now thanks to those arrests, not only did we stop the Sinaloa Cartel from becoming a viable operation in Philadelphia, we have also shut down another drug ring that was trying to destroy our city."
The defendants range in age from early 20s to late 40s and include a married couple from Puerto Rico. Charges include criminal conspiracy, possession with the intent to deliver and unlawful use of a communication facility.

Conrad Murray invites Katherine Jackson to visit him in jail
By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 5:29 AM EDT, Fri July 27, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Conrad Murray extends the invitation through his lawyers from jail
"I've been told that she has a desire to speak with me," Murray says
"It would put her at peace," he says
"She appeared to be extremely sad," Murray says of news clips of Katherine Jackson
Los Angeles (CNN) -- Conrad Murray, the doctor convicted in Michael Jackson's death, is inviting the late pop star's mother to visit him in jail to "answer any questions she might have."
Murray extended the invitation Tuesday night in a statement released to CNN through his lawyers, Valerie Wass and Michael Flanagan..
"I've been told that she has a desire to speak with me before she departs this life," Murray said. "Seeing that she is up in age and in questionable health, and the fact that she is the mother of a very dear departed friend, it would give me great pleasure to sit with her one on one and answer any questions she might have."
Murray was sentenced to four years in prison last November after a jury convicted him of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's June 25, 2009, death.
Katherine Jackson: Rumors are 'stupid'
Kids forgotten in Jackson family feud?
Katherine Jackson speaks out about drama
Murray, who is expected to serve at least two years in a Los Angeles County jail, said he would put Katherine Jackson's name on his visitor's list.
"It would put her at peace," he said. "I would do that truly out of concern for her and altruistic love and concern for others. I want to see her. I do not want Mrs. Jackson to suffer. She remains as dear to me as my own mother, unbeknownst to her."
News coverage of the ongoing feud among members of the Jackson family apparently prompted Murray's offer.
Jackson family drama an unwanted reality show
"Although I am not permitted to see the news in jail, there are times when intermittent snippets are seen before a channel change occurs," Murray said. "I recently saw Katherine Jackson in one of those snippets. She appeared to be extremely sad. I also heard she is having a difficult time."
A representative for Katherine Jackson said he would present the offer to her, but he doubted she would accept.
Katherine Jackson is dealing with a major division in her family that grew larger when four of her children recently took her to Arizona for 10 days without letting Michael Jackson's three children speak to her.

Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- One year, 365 days and an endless number of seconds, transformed my life 360 degrees, made it go from color to black-and-white, turned laughter into tears.
I now no longer perceive the world as a 14-year-old innocent girl who takes everything for granted, more as a victim of a terrible experience that'll never fade away, always reminding me of what others go through and a memory that will forever stay with me.
Before the revolution, I remember how, on cold winter nights we would sit together as a family, around the crackling fire sipping hot chocolate. I remember the smoke from the fireplace, wafting upward, leaving a scent of burning wood in the air. I remember looking into my sister's eyes and that glimmer they always had, the smiles my parents would share.
I remember how I used to love breaking the silence of the moment by rushing into my father's lap, tracing the narrow path of velvet veins on his hand, as I enthusiastically told him about my day at school, my second home and my friends, my second family.
We don't live those days anymore. Now no one's eyes can lie, and the only sound I can hear is the screaming of sorrow.

Life when fleeing everything
Escaping Syria to marry Rebels pound Syrian troops in north
Rebel forces attack a Syrian prison
March 23, 2011 was the first day I saw a demonstration in Syria. I was driving to a friend's birthday party, through streets that were packed with people carrying flags and calling out chants in support of the regime.
I was oblivious to my surroundings, I didn't know what was going on. I thought it was just a demonstration that would blow over.
"Barely any one is coming! Their parents are too scared to send them because of what's happening," my friend cried when she saw me. I looked into her eyes and saw the tears slowly forming and streaming down her red cheeks, streaking her dark make-up.
As weeks passed by it kept getting worse. One day I jumped out of bed to the sound of something loud shattering the windows of my room. Breathless, I got up too quickly, barely noticing the glass sparkling on my dull rug. I ran but came to a sudden halt as I felt my head spinning and my vision darkening.
My mom was crying and hugging my sister tightly. "A bomb hit an area nearby," my mother stuttered, switching through the different news channels while trying to block us from seeing it.
I managed to get a glimpse of it, on the TV, something I wish I had never seen. I remember my eyes feeling assaulted by the brightness on the screen, a sight that haunts me every night; dead bodies, bits of human flesh, were spread out like dispersed glass.
I closed my eyes and opened them again, hoping I would go back to the life I was used to, where unicorns and rainbows existed along with Prince Charmings and forever afters.
Unfortunately now, the dark days, and the nightmares take place on a regular basis, devastating my country and reluctant as I am to let it in, taking over my life, and controlling my mind.
From then on the world changed for me. Instead of learning it slowly through experience it was taught to me harshly through the sound of gunshots and bombardments. I discovered how cruel life can be, and how in one second a smile can turn into a tear, peace into war, a friend into an enemy and life into death.
I lived in a blur, not knowing what had happened or what I was to do.
I woke up every morning to the sound of gunshots, bombs or the roaring helicopters accompanied by the sad news of the death or kidnapping of someone we knew.
I learned that though mom may be older, taller and more experienced, deep down she needs me just as much as I need her.Cayanne
Some evenings, I hid under my blankets, covered my ears, and thought of the past trying to feel safe again.
I silently peeked out my window to continuously stare at the moon in its different forms casting a dim light, to stare at the sky and the stars emerge taking their place in the night. The image drawing me further and further from reality, into the life I yearned to go back to.
My parents tried to stay strong teaching us to do the same, until one night it all fell apart. I was sitting in my room, the place I hadn't left for a long time, talking to my friend about our memories, and suddenly, I hear a cry, whispers, the sound of my mother's sobs, then her yelling. "I'm going out to find him!"
My family has its own business and my father was late coming back home, not answering his phone.
"But it's too dangerous!" my aunt screamed back at my mother. "I don't care!" my mother shouted back.
I ran down the spiraling staircase terrified, afraid of what was happening. Everything went black, like a starless night. I felt like the walls of the house were closing in, suffocating me.
The background noise was blocked out and all I could do was stand and stare in dismay at my mom in this state for the first time. She lay on the stone courtyard just outside our front door, crying, holding her phone with a shivering hand dialing my dad's number like her life depended on it.
Everything stopped. It was like someone pressed the pause button in a movie, and now the seconds felt like hours. All I could hear was the pounding of my heart screaming over my mom's voice.
I don't know how long we waited, or how fast my heart was beating, but when my dad's car turned the corner, I gave everything I had left to run and hug him tighter than ever.
I get angry when other people my age complain about their life, about the silliest things.Cayanne
At that moment my senses returned and I realized how cold the ground was under my bare feet. I carried my mom inside, and from that day on I learned that though she may be older, taller and more experienced, deep down she needs me just as much as I need her.
Now, the one thing I looked forward to was waking up every morning and creeping into my parents' bedroom to look at my dad's thin and frail face making sure he had made it in safe the night before.
In school, only half my class was left. "At least we have each other," said one of my five best friends with a comforting smile.
However that didn't last for long.
Devastating news kept coming at us, beginning with the death of my friend's uncle. "In one second I lost my uncle; a part of me," she whispered in a heartbreaking tone.
I looked at her hopelessly, trying to comfort her, but I knew no words could bring him back. Every morning for one month, no words were spoken by anyone besides the ones of regret.
"If we knew this was coming, we would have done things so differently," we would tell each other.
We wouldn't have taken so much for granted, we would have appreciated what we had. Instead it was ripped away.
Grades dropped, smiles faded, students left, and all that remained were the memories that we would safely lock away.
As my dad protectively drove us to and from school, the only places we could go to, I noticed the row of soldiers on the streets. They reminded me of domino pieces. Their presence radiated darkness.
Each one had a solemn appearance, frightening eyes that looked right through you below their crunched frown. However, what always caught my eye were their large guns, the color of the dark pine trees they leaned on.
I went from looking at colorful flowers and singing birds every morning, to dark killer weapons.
April 5, 2012 was my last day of school. My parents decided to move us all to Lebanon. I had known it was coming all along. It wasn't a surprise. Everyone was moving.
I sank in my seat that day at school, buried my head into my hands and cried like I did every day.
I remembered how when I heard the news about Egypt and the violence in Tahrir Square and thinking to myself that I was far from harm's way. Now I was considering how hard it would be to move away from my home, my dad, my friends and family -- not knowing anyone or anything, possibly never being able to contact them because of the broken phone lines.
My mind wandered back to 10 years ago when I first stepped foot into the school, only worrying about things like my friendship bracelets, and now I was expected to leave everything I ever knew behind. The people who knew me inside and out, who had carved a place in my heart.
Memories flashed accompanied by more tears as my friends gathered around me and I opened my swollen eyes trying to picture the scene hoping it would last forever.
I am angry and I feel hatred to the people that are ruining my country, anyone who is holding a gun and shooting no matter which side they're on. Those who stole my childhood and that of so many others.
My dream was to apply to universities with my friends as well as cry tears of joy when we threw our graduation hats in the air. Now that was crushed to pieces. One part of me, knows that this isn't good bye, and that no matter where this crazy world takes us when the time is right we will return.
Another part of me is scared that more people will die, even if they are not close to me. Everyone has a family, friends and they suffering. I am scared that I will lose the hope that I now have about being able to return, and being left with nothing but memories.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Julian Zelizer: President George W. Bush is enjoying another bounce in the polls Zelizer: With a few exceptions, presidential reputations are never fixed in stone
He says one reason is that passions for presidents tend to lessen after they leave office Zelizer: President Obama has done Bush a favor by continuing some of his policies Editor's note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of "Jimmy Carter" and "Governing America." (CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush is enjoying another bounce in the post-presidential polls. First, the opening of his presidential library produced a spate of positive coverage about his time in office. Now, Gallup has released a survey showing that for the first time since 2005, more people approve than disapprove of Bush.
This kind of shift in public opinion is likely to continue, with more upswings as well as downturns ahead. This is the nature of presidential legacies. They are a bit like what Mark Twain once said about the weather in New England: if you don't like it, just wait a second and it will change.
Presidential reputations are never fixed in stone.
With the exception of a few of our leaders, such as Abraham Lincoln of Franklin Roosevelt, people tend to remember presidents in different ways at different times. Even some of the more unpopular presidents have seen their support rise in the post-presidency period.
Why is it the case?
Julian Zelizer
The most obvious reason is that the passions for presidents -- both good and bad -- tend to go down after they leave office. Americans turn their attention to the new boss and to new issues, and the focus of their sentiment shifts elsewhere. This is particularly true in our heated political times when voters become so polarized on their feelings about a leader -- feelings that can become most intense as we approach the elections.
Another factor has to do with what the successor does in office.
Much of the controversy that surrounded Bush had to do with his national security policies. The war in Iraq caused a huge controversy with many Americans feeling the president had gone into an unnecessary war based on false evidence. By the second term, many Americans were also upset with some of the tactics the administration had used to pursue terrorists, such as interrogation.
But President Barack Obama, who campaigned as a critic of these policies, ended up leaving many of the programs in place and actually becoming more aggressive on certain fronts, such as the use of drone strikes. Obama has given these controversial policies a certain bipartisan imprimatur that has dulled the anger that existed toward Bush.
The ways in which a president's policies unfold over time is also essential. In some ways, Obama did Bush a favor. By bringing Iraq and Afghanistan to an end, he took these issues off the public radar. Without any kind of mass chaos in those countries, as some critics had warned would occur, the issues that caused Bush so much problems faded from the public mind.
The flip side is that some policies look better in perspective. Although the TARP program still has many critics, the fact that it stabilized the financial markets and ended up not costing the federal government any money makes one of Bush's most controversial decisions look better in hindsight.
Presidential reputations also can be shaped, in the relative short term, by what a president does after leaving office.
For example, former President Jimmy Carter has been successful in rehabilitating his image through his extensive post-presidential activities on foreign policy. Former President Bill Clinton has enjoyed strong approval for his work with his international foundation and, among Democrats, through his decision to engage in partisan wars after his time was done.
Bush might have helped himself by staying outside of the media spotlight.
There is a certain amount of good will that emerges as the structural problems with politics become clear. When a president is in office, they tend to receive all the blame, or credit, for what happens in Washington. When there are problems moving forward a policy, such as in reviving the economy, the public tends to blame the president. But when those problems continue long after a president is gone, as has been the case with the economy, the public tends to gain some perspective (even as they attack the existing president) about how the sources of discontent stem from the structural problems with the government and the economy rather than any individual person.
We judge a president based on the political times we are living in -- not simply in the times that they governed. Presidential reputations could improve if the polls are tallied at a moment when a president resonates with the politics of the moment.
Finally, and this is not relevant to Bush yet, the opening of archival records from the period a president is in office can dramatically change how we see him.
President Dwight Eisenhower, who was once treated as a popular yet bumbling president, was found to have had a firm grip on decision-making in the White House. Discoveries from the Ronald Reagan archives in Simi Valley, California, revealed that he was much more than a former Hollywood actor who moved to the top through charisma and luck.
Obama might want to take a close look at these kinds of swings.
On the one hand, it might give him some solace that even with all the grief he has faced over issues such as health care and sluggish economic growth, it is easy to see how his record could look much stronger to Americans over time.
On the other hand, he might want to be a bit cautious about taking too much comfort from positive approval ratings. After all, it's all relative with respect to time.

Is class the new race?
By John D. Sutter, CNN
updated 11:37 AM EDT, Wed October 30, 2013
August 28, 1963, was one of the most important days for the civil rights movement. Over 200,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington to hear Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his famous "I Have a Dream" speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Magnum photographer Leonard Freed (1929-2006) was there documenting that historic day.
The crowd gathers at the National Mall.
People sing together during the march.
Though the name March on Washington"is well known, the full title of the gathering the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
People sing together during the rally.
Ten leaders of the civil rights movement met with President John F. Kennedy, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Labor Secretary W. Willard Wirtz and Burke Marshall, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, in the Cabinet room of the White House during the demonstration.
People watch and wait for speakers.
Though the most iconic shot from the March on Washington may be of King waving to the crowd, Freed moved throughout the crowd finding the faces that weren't seen in the papers.
The marchers were entertained by big names such as Ossie Davis, Joan Baez, Bobby Darin, Odetta, Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul and Mary, and Jackie Robinson.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the historic march.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Fast-food workers scheduled protests across the country this week
John Sutter: Class seems to be the social justice issue of our time
It's been 50 years since the "March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom" Economic justice remains a distant dream for many, Sutter says
Editor's note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion and head of CNN's Change the List project. Follow him on Twitter, Facebook or Google+. E-mail him at ctl@cnn.com.
(CNN) -- Let's play a little game.
Which of the following signs did protestors hold at the March on Washington, 50 years ago this week, and which were held up this year by fast-food workers:
1. "WE MARCH FOR HIGHER MINIMUM WAGES
COVERAGE FOR ALL WORKERS NOW!"
2. "WE ARE WORTH MORE"
3. "I AM A MAN"
4. "WE MARCH FOR JOBS FOR ALL A DECENT PAY NOW!"
The exclamation points, which apparently were more popular in the 1960s (despite what Twitter would have you believe!!!), are your best clue.
John D. Sutter
Signs one and four are from 1963. Two and three are from 2013.
Fifty years later, it's easy to forget that the full name of the 1963 "March on Washington" was actually "The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom."
Sutter: 99 must-reads on economic inequality But flip through some pictures from that rally, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous "I Have A Dream" speech and where civil rights leaders, to borrow his words, bent the arc of history towards justice and greater equality, and you'll see protest signs that put the economy as a front-and-center issue, just as it is now.
"CIVIL RIGHTS PLUS FULL EMPLOYMENT
EQUALS FREEDOM."
Fast food workers demand fair pay
President Obama, in commemorating the 50th anniversary of that march this week, smartly picked up on the theme that economic equality is "the great unfinished business" of King's vision for a just and fair America.
"...[A]s we mark this anniversary, we must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many blacks had joined the ranks of millionaires; it was whether this country would admit all people who were willing to work hard, regardless of race, into the ranks of a middle-class life," Obama said Wednesday. "The test was not and never has been whether the doors of opportunity are cracked a bit wider for a few. It was whether our economic system provides a fair shot for the many, for the black custodian and the white steelworker, the immigrant dishwasher and the Native American veteran."
The subtext of his argument: Class may be the new race.
It's not that all battles for racial equality have been won -- they haven't -- or that we live in a post-racial society. But, in some remarkable and troubling ways, class has become an increasingly significant barrier to equality in modern America. The gap between rich and poor has been growing in the United States since the late 1970s, and our level of income inequality, one proxy measure for that gap, is now on par with many sub-Saharan African countries.
Sutter: Who cares about the economy? ... You!
It's become more difficult for the poor to move up into the middle class and more difficult for the middle to dig in its heels to stop from slipping into poverty.
The American mantra of "work hard and you'll get ahead" is not always enough to sustain people. It's harder now to secure a financial future.
This is the theme that underlies much of what's happening in America today. And it's something that goes back much farther than the recent recession.
The fast-food workers, for example, who scheduled demonstrations across the country on Thursday, are frustrated by the fact that they can't make ends meet on $7.25 per hour. If you doubt whether that's true, please take a look at one fast-food worker's budget. Some workers, as Forbes reports, have to choose between paying for rent or food. "Should I pay my light bill (or) should I pay my gas?" one fast-food worker asks in this CNNMoney video. "I never can pay it all at once."
"Right now the gas is off," she says.
The workers demand a living wage of $15 per hour.
I'm not sure what the fair wage would be. That's the subject for another column...or perhaps a book. But I do know that, as The Atlantic reports, fast-food workers in Australia make $14.50 an hour, about twice the U.S. minimum wage.
And burgers haven't become too expensive Down Under.
Some context is helpful for understanding that movement as well.
The U.S. minimum wage is actually lower than it was in the late 1960s. Five years after King's speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial, the federal minimum wage, when converted into 2013 dollars, was $10.70, compared to $7.25 now. (The nominal minimum wage, according to the Congressional Research Service, was only $1.60 per hour in 1968. The $10.70 amount is adjusted for inflation).
Sutter: White House should pay its interns
Education is another example. There's evidence poverty is a better indicator of educational achievement than race.
"According to a 2011 research study by Stanford sociologist Sean Reardon, the test-score gap between the children of the poor (in the 10th percentile of income) and the children of the wealthy (in the 90th percentile) has expanded by as much as 40% and is now more than 50% larger than the black-white achievement gap -- a reversal of the trend 50 years ago," Sarah Garland writes for The Atlantic.
"Underprivileged children now languish at achievement levels that are close to four years behind their wealthy peers."
Four years behind their peers. Just because of their income.
That challenges the very notion of who we are as Americans.
We see ourselves as a middle-class country -- a place where anyone can work hard and succeed. And many do. We're a country of fighters.
But it's become more difficult for the non-rich to make it.
The country has made great strides toward racial equality since the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. But, in the 50 years since King's speech, economic justice seems to have become the more distant dream.

(CNN) -- The death of movie star Paul Walker has both shocked and enthralled fans.
Perhaps it is because of the irony of the buff actor coming to fame in the "Fast & Furious" franchise to then lose his life in a car crash. Or maybe it is due to the fact that at the age of 40, his death was so unexpected and means he will now forever be frozen in time in the minds of fans -- defined not only by his roles and his philanthropy, but also by the footage of a smoking wreck which trapped him and his friend Roger Rodas.

Actor Paul Walker dies
Walker's pal: I feel like I lost my son
Did you hear what Paul Walker did?
Walker tribute video goes viral
1) Authorities are focusing on the car and how fast it was going
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office has said speed was a factor in the crash, which occurred after Walker hopped in Rodas' 2005 Porsche Carrera GT for a ride, according to witnesses. The rare vehicle has three times the horsepower of an average car and is reportedly not easy to handle.
Both Rodas and Walker were experienced drivers and had raced in competitions before.
2) Toxicology tests are not yet in
According to an autopsy report from the Los Angles County coroner's office, results of toxicology testing, which would show if drugs or alcohol played a role in the accident, won't be available for six to eight weeks. Both men's deaths have been officially ruled an accident.
3) Production of 'Fast & Furious 7' is on hold
"At this time we feel it is our responsibility to shut down production on 'Fast & Furious 7' for a period of time so we can assess all options available to move forward with the franchise," Universal Pictures said in a statement.
Walker was on Thanksgiving break from filming the latest movie in the franchise in Atlanta at the time of the accident. A source close to the production told CNN that the studio is trying to figure out how to move ahead with a movie featuring fast cars and crashes, given that one of its stars was so tragically killed in an accident. Editors have been reviewing footage that had already been shot with Walker in an attempt to see if any of it would work with a rewritten script, the source said.

4) The wreckage is of interest
Jameson Witty, 18, was arrested and accused of allegedly stealing a piece of the charred Porsche as it was being transported after the crash. Authorities arrested Witty in Tujunga, California, and said a red T-top roof panel was recovered from a residence in Canyon Country. The sheriff's department said a 25-year-old man connected to the case had also been identified and was making arrangements to surrender himself.
5) Friends and family are grappling with the loss
Those who knew and loved both Rodas, who was a married father of two, and Walker, who was raising his 15-year-old daughter Meadow as a single parent, have come to the crash scene to mourn as well as taken to social media to express their heartbreak.
The Walker family posted the following statement on his official Facebook page:
"Paul Walker's family appreciates the outpouring of love and goodwill from his many fans and friends. They have asked, in lieu of flowers or other gifts, that donations please be made to Paul's charity Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW). Donations can easily be made through their website at http://www.ROWW.org/.
"It's comforting for them to know that the son, brother, and father they love so much is equally adored, respected, and appreciated by so many. Paul founded the organization with the genuine desire to help others, and it's important to his family to keep his memory alive through ROWW."
According to 2011 tax information from the organization, 35% of the funds raised went to the charity's programs. The rest of the funds are used for administrative and fundraising costs.
