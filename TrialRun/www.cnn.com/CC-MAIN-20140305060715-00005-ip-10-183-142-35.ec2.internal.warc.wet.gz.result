To my critics: Teachers deserve rights By Diane Ravitch, Special to CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSDiane Ravitch's column supporting Wisconsin teachers got huge, emotional responseMany agree teachers demonized, she says, but others think they deserve itWisconsin public sector unions agreed to all the governor's financial demands, she saysAim is busting unions, she writes, to leave no barrier to more cuts in pay, benefits Editor's note: Diane Ravitch is a historian of education and the author of the best seller "The Death and Life of the Great American School System." (CNN) -- A few days ago, I wrote an opinion piece for CNN.com explaining why teachers in Wisconsin -- and throughout the nation -- are angry, and it isn't just because Gov. Scott Walker asked them to pay more for their pensions and health-care benefits. They are angry because of the unwarranted public vilification that has been heaped on them for the past two years. The response was unlike anything I have ever seen before, and I've been writing about education for 40 years. The column received more than 8,000 comments and more than 38,000 Facebook shares. I personally received scores of emails. The overwhelming majority came from teachers, who simply wanted to say "thank you" for showing them the respect they deserve. But about one of every 10 that I received came from dissenters complaining that teachers have an easy life, that their benefits are too generous, and that unions are selfish and greedy. A few were venomous and suggested anatomically impossible feats. One writer insulted teachers with this: "The majority of them have degrees in education, which are basically paths to baccalaureate degrees for people too stupid to get through degree programs in math, science, engineering, or even business." CNN.com commenter "26thirdstree" wrote: "If the teachers don't like it they can quit. The fact is the teachers unions in this country have been bilking the taxpayers for years." Another went so far as to suggest that all the teachers should be fired and replaced by anyone who wanted their jobs. Well, that would surely improve education! Anyone who has spent much time in schools today knows that it is not easy to be a teacher, especially when so many parents are missing in action. Teachers today face tough challenges: Some of their students have parents who are incarcerated or absent, some stay home while their parents look for work, some have varying degrees of disabilities, some don't read or speak English, some live in neighborhoods infested with gangs and violence, some of their students arrive in September far behind others in their grade. Opinion: Reinvent unions, don't gut them [Teachers] tell me about overcrowded classrooms ... about stabbings and funerals. This is not the age of 'Leave it to Beaver.'--Diane Ravitch
Ohio governor: Pensions 'not negotiable'
60 kids per class in Detroit schools
I hear from teachers all the time. They tell me about overcrowded classrooms, about how their school hasn't had an art or music teacher in years, about how they buy supplies out of their own pockets, about stabbings and funerals. This is not the age of "Leave it to Beaver." As for pension and health-care envy, it is a sad thing when working Americans complain that someone else has benefits, instead of agreeing that everyone should have coverage for their health and old age. It reminds me of an old Soviet joke where a peasant says, "My neighbor has a cow and I have none, I want his cow to die." We should not join in this race to the bottom. Here's a comment from CNN.com reader "feholder": "The real story in Madison is not about fed-up teachers. It's about gluttonous unions who don't realize the world has moved on." So, it is important to point out that the public sector unions in Wisconsin have already agreed to all of the governor's financial demands. Without any negotiations, they agreed to raise their pension contribution from less than 1% of their pay up to 5.8% and to more than double their contribution to their health care from 6% to at least 12.6%. "SarahInTexas" says: "Employers all across the U.S. are cutting salaries and wages .... Teachers or any other public workers should not be exempt from this reality." Teachers don't believe they are exempt. Sunday, Mary Bell, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said, "Money issues are off the table." Public employees "have agreed to Gov. Walker's pension and health care concessions." This is a controversy in which there are no more financial questions to be resolved. Roland Martin: Unions have to make concessions The only remaining issue is whether the unions will be permitted to bargain on anything other than wages -- such as working conditions -- whether pay raises will be limited by a pre-set formula, and whether unions will be required to hold annual votes on whether they should exist. It is a sad thing when working Americans complain that someone else has benefits.--Diane Ravitch

In other words, Walker talks budget, but his real goal is to bust the union and eliminate it as a force in Wisconsin politics. What this means, if the governor's bill passes, is that the only organized force that protects and defends education spending in the state of Wisconsin will be neutralized. If the union is reduced to political roadkill, the forces of privatization and educational austerity will have their way in Wisconsin. They will cut and cut and cut some more. Who will oppose them? This will not be good for the future of Wisconsin. Unions do not by themselves guarantee high educational achievement, but they certainly assure that adequate funding will be available to keep class sizes reasonable and to provide programs and services that children need. Without adequate funding, academic progress is unlikely to occur. Certainly other organized interests will continue to be heard in Madison, but not teachers or others who work in the public sector. If the voices of their teachers are silenced, who will stand up for students? The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Diane Ravitch.

Death toll in Japan tops 6,400 By the CNN Wire Staff Man's quest to support survivorsSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Police say 6,406 are confirmed dead and 10,259 are missingNEW:Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi plant continue efforts to douse a reactorThe Pentagon authorizes voluntary departures for some military familiesThe U.S. sends a special team to advise the Japanese governmentGet up-to-the-minute developments at CNN's live blog on the disaster in Japan. Washington (CNN) -- The death toll from the monster 9.0-magnitude earthquake and massive tsunami that hit Japan climbed past 6,400 Friday as search teams continued to comb through the rubble. Japan's National Police agency said 6,406 people were confirmed dead and 10,259 were reported missing as of 9 a.m. Friday (8 p.m. Thursday ET). Meanwhile Japanese authorities vowed Friday to keep dousing water on a troubled nuclear reactor, with its owner saying that earlier attempts have been "somewhat effective" in addressing radiation concerns. Still, the Fukushima Daiichi complex of six nuclear reactors remained a danger. Radiation levels there Thursday morning measured nearly 3.8 millisieverts per hour -- more than a typical resident of a developed country receives in a year -- Tokyo Electric said. A company official noted on Friday afternoon that radiation levels at the plant's west gate, measured at .26 to .27 millisieverts, have been fairly stable over a recent 12-hour span.

Japan: Survivors struggle to keep warm
U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday that he was "heartbroken" over events in Japan but was offering resources to help the Japanese recover as well as to keep U.S. citizens out of harm's way. In a statement at the White House, Obama noted that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Wednesday called for U.S. citizens to evacuate to beyond a 50-mile radius of the stricken plants in northeastern Japan. That figure exceeds the 12.4-mile evacuation radius and 18.6-mile shelter radius called for by the Japanese government. Obama said the stricter U.S. recommendation was "based upon a careful scientific evaluation." He also noted that the government has authorized the voluntary departure of family and dependents of U.S. officials in northeast Japan, and he called on all U.S. citizens in Japan "to carefully monitor the situation." The crisis poses little risk to people in the United States, he said. "Whether it's the West Coast, Hawaii, Alaska or U.S. territories in the Pacific, we do not expect harmful levels of radiation," he said. "That's the judgment of our Nuclear Regulatory Commission and many other experts." He added that public health experts do not recommend that people in the United States take precautionary measures beyond staying informed. Though U.S. nuclear plants "have undergone exhaustive study and been declared safe for any number of extreme contingencies," Obama said that, in light of the disaster, he has asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to carry out a comprehensive review of the plants. Meanwhile, the United States is "working aggressively" to offer support, with search-and-rescue teams and disaster-response teams and members of the U.S. military working in Japan. "To date, we have flown hundreds of missions to support the recovery efforts and distributed thousands of pounds of food and water." He added, "We're sharing with them expertise, equipment and technology so that the courageous responders on the team have the benefit of American teamwork and support." Earlier, during a visit to the Japanese Embassy, Obama said he was "heartbroken" over the events. "I'm going to be making a statement, communicate how heartbroken we are of this tragedy," he said at the Embassy, where he met with Ambassador Ichiro Fujisaki and signed a book of condolences. "Please know that America will stand by one of its greatest allies during this time of need," he wrote. "Because of the strength and wisdom of its peoples, we know that Japan will recover, and indeed will emerge stronger than ever." Outside the embassy, flags hung at half-staff. Washington's attention to the disaster came as thousands of Japanese settled, perhaps indefinitely, into shelters as the government scrambled to avert a wider nuclear disaster and foreigners sought to get out of the nation.

Foreign nationals formed long lines at the Tokyo immigration office for permits to temporarily leave, and the U.S. Defense Department authorized the voluntary departure of some relatives of servicemembers stationed in Japan. The State Department said Americans may still be inside the 50-mile evacuation zone. "I would be surprised if we don't (have Americans in the zone) because we have literally thousands of names of Americans who reside in Japan," Deputy Assistant Secretary of State James Pettit said Thursday. "It would be hard to believe some of them do not live within that zone." The State Department was sending a fleet of 14 buses to Sendai, Japan -- north of the evacuation zone -- to evacuate perhaps as many as 600 Americans who may still be in one of the areas hardest hit by the earthquake and tusunami and having difficulty traveling because of road damage. "Those buses are en route, the consular teams are up in that area. They are getting out the word where the rallying points are," Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy said Thursday. He said the Americans were private American citizens either living or touring in Japan at the time of the disaster. Kennedy said there were conflicting numbers of how many Americans were in Japan when the earthquake and tsunami hit, with some estimates as high as 550,000. "They are all guesses," Pettit said. The potential number of U.S. military evacuees is "in the thousands," Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said, adding that the authorization applies only to relatives living on the island of Honshu -- site of the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant -- and will not cover those who are simply visiting. The United States has also authorized $35 million in humanitarian assistance for Japan, Lapan said, and the U.S. military is sending a nine-member team specializing in responding to nuclear hazards to advise the Japanese government. The team can assess radiation damage and advise on cleanup, among other capabilities. In the hardest-hit parts of the country, thousands of people, many of them frail and elderly, settled into shelters not knowing when they might be able to leave. They busied themselves with the ordinary: standing in line for lunch, or arranging the few belongings they salvaged before water washed away their homes. The government tried furiously to cool nuclear reactors in its latest bid to avert a wider disaster. Helicopters, fire trucks and police water cannon dumped or shot water on the No. 3 unit at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Stocks dropped Thursday in Japan. The Nikkei 225 index, a measure of stocks traded in Tokyo, was down 454 points, or 5%, before rebounding and ending a nervous trading day down 131 points, or 1.4%. On Thursday morning, Japanese forces made four helicopter passes in about a 20-minute span, dropping 7.5 tons of seawater each time on the facility's No. 3 unit in an attempt to cool its overheated spent fuel pool. Video of the operation on public broadcaster NHK showed that only one of the loads appeared to drop directly on the building. Experts say that steam rising from that pool, which holds at least partially exposed fuel rods, may be releasing radiation into the atmosphere. But hours later, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the plant, said the efforts would continue. A Japanese government spokesman, Noriyuki Shikata, tried to allay fears of an imminent meltdown. "We have not seen a major breach of containment" at any of the plant's troubled nuclear reactors, he said. A meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods cannot be cooled and the nuclear core melts. In the worst-case scenario, the fuel can spill out of the containment unit and spread radioactivity through the air and water. That, public health officials say, can cause both immediate and long-term health problems, including radiation poisoning and cancer. Authorities also have banned flights over the area.CNN's Charley Keyes, Kyung Lah, Larry Shaughnessy, Gary Tuchman, Stan Grant, Brian Walker, Holly Yan, Ben Rooney, Jessica Ellis and Sean Morris and journalist Diego Laje contributed to this report.

Read a version of this story in Arabic.
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A senior al Qaeda leader was killed in a drone strike Thursday in Pakistan, two of the country's intelligence officials told CNN on Sunday.
Sheikh Khalid bin Abdel Rehman, who also went by the code name Abu Zaid al-Kuwaiti, was killed in the strike near Miran Shah in North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan, the officials said.
On Sunday, a suspected drone strike killed three militants in the region, intelligence officials said. Four missiles struck a hideout in the village of Tabbi in North Waziristan, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak to the media.
The militants' identities were not immediately announced.

By Natasha Dragun, Special to CNN
updated 9:02 AM EST, Fri January 4, 2013
A cycling storm is expected in Corsica in 2013, when the Mediterranean island hosts a leg of the Tour de France for the first time.
Having just celebrated the 50th anniversary of The Beatles' first record, Liverpudlians are looking forward to another installment of International Beatle Week in August and welcoming visitors to the freshly minted Museum of Liverpool.
The Harpa Reykjavík Concert Hall and Conference Centre opened here not long ago and is now the official home of the Icelandic Opera and Iceland Symphony Orchestra.
In 2013, Istanbul will host a handful of forward-thinking fetes, including the inaugural edition of Art Istanbul International at the Haskoy Yarn Factory.
Encircled by the Alps, Innsbruck offers the ultimate access to some of Europe's best ski fields.
It may be one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean, but Crete offers plenty of intimate experiences, plus plenty of reasons to party -- the island is celebrating a century of union with Greece in December 2013.
In Helsinki's Narinkka Square, the freshly minted Kamppi Chapel of Silence resembles a wooden egg, dressed in fir and with a halo-shaped skylight beneath which you can sneak a moment of quiet contemplation.
The old Harland and Wolff Shipyard has been reinvented as the Titanic Quarter and is now home to the spectacular Titanic Belfast complex.
Some of Amsterdam's blockbuster museums are reopening in 2013 after extensive renovations.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Corsica is set to host part of the Tour de France for the first time in 2013
The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is reopening in April after a 10-year renovation
Berlin is set to open a handful of luxury hotels
Istanbul will host the inaugural edition of Art Istanbul International
(CNN) -- Whether you're looking for culture or just a reason to party, you'll want to make sure these European destinations are on your radar in 2013.
Thanks to a slew of new galleries, hotels and museums paired with festivals, fairs and more, there's plenty to keep you busy across the Continent in the coming year.
CNN's 2013 travel wish list
Corsica, France
It's France, but not as we know it.
A petite island a couple of hundred kilometers from the French mainland, Corsica flies under the radar for the most part -- and that's part of its appeal.
Hillside Mediterranean towns are blissfully crowd-free compared to the streets of tourist hot spots like Cannes and Nice, and you'll have most beaches entirely to yourself.

Still, the real draw in 2013 will be thousands of men clad in Lycra.
For the first time in history, Corsica will host a leg of the Tour de France (June 29-July 21).
More than that, it will hold the opening of the event, celebrating the race's 100th year with pomp and ceremony -- and some serious cycling.
The 3,360-kilometer race weaves across the country until it reaches Paris, where the pedaling culminates against the backdrop of a floodlit Arc de Triomphe.

Liverpool, England
If you've heard Liverpool mentioned only in reference to its football club, you're missing out.
Besides London, it's arguably the most exciting destination in England at the moment, offering plenty of reasons to party well into the New Year.
Having just celebrated the 50th anniversary of The Beatles' first record -- the Fab Four formed here in 1960 -- Liverpudlians are looking forward to another installment of International Beatle Week in August, commemorating the music and lives of one of the most influential pop groups of all time.
The festivities continue at the freshly minted Museum of Liverpool, where a new theater (opening in early 2013) will host music and drama events alongside insightful exhibitions and film screenings, many of them free.

8 travel resolutions for 2013
Reykjavik, Iceland
The fact that it's one of the most affordable destinations in Europe aside, Iceland's capital is cool on many levels.
Kissing latitude 67 degrees north, the isolated island of volcanoes and glaciers is home to equal urban drama: the Harpa Reykjavík Concert Hall and Conference Centre opened here not long ago and is now the official home of the Icelandic Opera and Iceland Symphony Orchestra.
Local favorite Björk has also been known to belt out a tune or two in the shimmering glass-clad building, embedded with colored LED strips.
While the glowing hall is pretty, it's hard to beat the lights in the night sky. Until April, Reykjavik and much of northern Europe are forecast to be treated to some of the best showings of the Aurora Borealis in history.
The Winter Lights Festival (February 7-10) will bring music, performances and food to help you get in the mood.

Wishes for smooth journeys in the new year
Istanbul, Turkey
Turkey's biggest city delights visitors with some of Europe's hippest hotels and boutiques, not to mention a booming contemporary arts scene.
In 2013, Istanbul will host a handful of forward-thinking fetes, including the inaugural edition of Art Istanbul International at the Haskoy Yarn Factory (September 14-17), showcasing exciting new works from Turkey, the Middle East and beyond.
September also heralds the larger Istanbul Biennial (September 14-November 10), curated by renowned critic Fulya Erdemci.
Creative hoteliers are flocking to the city in response, which means that visitors can look forward to 2013 outposts from the likes of Shangri-La, Raffles and Hilton, among others.

A sweet tour of Istanbul
Innsbruck, Austria
The Austrian capital may steal the spotlight from the rest of the country -- let's face it, Vienna is one beautiful city -- but Innsbruck deserves a place in the sun.
Encircled by the Alps, the city offers the ultimate access to some of Europe's best ski fields: hop on a funicular in town, zip past jaw-dropping railway stations designed by Zaha Hadid and you'll find yourself flying down untrammeled snow in no time.
Visit early in the year and you'll share the slopes with the world's snowboarding elite for the 20th edition of the Billabong Air & Style (February 1-2).
White stuff aside, Innsbruck offers equal allure during its warmer months, when visitors jump on bikes and cycle between historic hillside towns.
Crete, Greece
It may be one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean, but Crete offers plenty of intimate experiences, plus plenty of reasons to party -- the island is celebrating a century of union with Greece in December 2013.
Away from the blissful beach resorts, still extremely good value thanks to the country's recent economic woes, chilling of another kind is in full swing.
Crete is developing a reputation as one of the region's finest wine producers, with a growing catalog of extremely drinkable native grape varieties: Vilana and Vidiano, Dafni and Kotsifali, Mandilari and Thrapsathiri.
The best bit? Many of the vineyards are wedged between languid towns where predictably good tavernas dish up uncomplicated, but classic, Cretan fare for a handful of euros.
Helsinki, Finland
The World Design Capital in 2012, Helsinki continues to push creative boundaries.
In Narinkka Square, the freshly minted Kamppi Chapel of Silence resembles a wooden egg, dressed in fir and with a halo-shaped skylight beneath which you can sneak a moment of quiet contemplation.
Another eye-opening building will soon feature pine, larch and spruce rooms: the upcoming Kulttuurisauna will be the first public sauna to open in the city in some 50 years.
And on the outskirts of Helsinki in Espoo, the WeeGee Exhibition Centre is now home to The Futuro, an elliptical plastic house showcasing the space-age architecture and design of the late 1960s.
An equal spectacle will unfold at sea in 2013 when Helsinki hosts the Tall Ship Races for four days (July 17-20), welcoming more than 100 imposing vessels on their voyage from Denmark to Poland.

Belfast, Northern Ireland
Near, far, wherever you are, you've no doubt heard a lot about Belfast -- and the legendary cruise liner it launched.
The ill-fated Titanic, which went down just over a century ago on April 15, 1912, was built and floated in Belfast and you can still visit the old Harland and Wolff Shipyard where the luxurious vessel was brought to life.
Today, the area has been reinvented as the Titanic Quarter -- Europe's largest urban regeneration scheme -- and is now home to the spectacular Titanic Belfast complex.
Newly opened, the space showcases an impressive collection of memorabilia, taking you from the conception to the destruction of the ship, and also hosts activities for the Titanic Belfast Festival (April 2013).
If that doesn't float your boat, book in for one of Titanic Walking Tours' excursions, where you'll learn yet more about the Titanic and how it changed the city forever.

Amsterdam, Netherlands
It's a bit obvious as a Euro hot spot, but there is a reason -- well, there are many -- why Amsterdam is a must-visit in 2013.
For a start, the Rijksmuseum will open once again on April 13, welcoming visitors after 10 years of renovations.
Highlights of the made-over space will include a dazzling new pavilion dedicated to Asian art, as well as lighter, brighter and impeccably restored halls, cupolas and galleries.
Other milestones over the course of the year include the reopening of the Van Gogh Museum (April 25), just in time to mark Vincent's 160th birthday and the gallery's 40th, and the 400th anniversary of the city's canal ring, which was added to the World Heritage List in 2010.
Celebrations will be in order.

Berlin, Germany
Come October 2013, Berlin will be much easier to fly into, thanks to the highly anticipated (and well overdue) opening of the Brandenburg Airport, replacing three other airports at a cost of more than €4.2 billion (US$5.4 billion).
Needless to say, it will be one of the most modern terminal buildings in the world.
And when you do finally touch down you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that Berlin is home to some of the most affordable five-star hotels in the world at the moment.
Newcomers to look out for include the 232-room Waldorf Astoria Berlin (opening February), as well as boutique properties Bikini Berlin and Leonardo Hotel Berlin Mitte. The Waldorf will be part of a large retail complex with upscale boutiques, a cinema and office space and will feature a spacious rooftop terrace and bar.
The Leonardo will resemble a glass-and-metal pyramid and has been designed by notable German architect Eike Becker.

Teacher talks armed student into giving up, police say
By Thom Patterson, CNN
updated 9:23 PM EST, Fri January 11, 2013
Authorities say teacher Ryan Heber helped talk the gunman into handing over his weapon.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Teacher rejects the label "hero"
A well-liked science teacher persuades a student to give up his shotgun
Also, a campus supervisor distracted the teen while other students escaped, police say
Taft, California, high school classes are canceled Friday as students receive counseling (CNN) -- The teacher stood in the classroom, face-to-face with his 16-year-old student, who was holding a shotgun.
Ryan Heber, 40, talked to the teen, trying to persuade him to end an armed assault in which one student had already been shot.
Heber had no idea whether the student -- whose pockets were filled with ammunition -- would put the gun down or pull the trigger.
Campus supervisor Kim Fields helped distract the teen, allowing other students in the classroom to escape, while Heber talked to him, according to CNN affiliate KGET.
Eventually, the teen let go of the gun, and police took him into custody.
That was how police described the frightening situation Thursday at Taft Union High School, about 30 miles outside Bakersfield, California.
"To stand there and face someone that has a shotgun, who's already discharged it and shot a student, speaks volumes for these two young men and what they may have prevented," Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood said Thursday.
Heber, however, hates the term hero. He told CNN Friday that he doesn't want to be labeled anything except "teacher."
Classes were canceled for Friday, the school website said, and on-campus counseling was being made available for students in the morning.
Student: Gunman had a hit list
NRA calls for armed security at schools
NRA pres.: Up to schools to protect kids The wounded student was in critical but stable condition Thursday night, and the shooter was in custody, police said. Heber and his wife, who also works at the school, visited the hospital Friday and met with the father of the victim.
The name of the student in custody was not released. He will be charged as a juvenile with attempted murder, according to Youngblood, who added that prosecutors will decide whether he should be charged as an adult. Authorities searched his home, according to sheriff's spokesman Ray Pruitt.
Heber, who teaches science, is known as a well-liked teacher at the school, according to his father, David Heber. He is himself a graduate of Taft, where he played football and served as student body president.
David Heber wasn't surprised that his son played a key role in defusing the situation, saying Ryan Heber makes a point of getting to know his students -- including the suspected gunman -- on a personal level.
"Because he knows the boy and the boy knows him ... I attribute that to why the boy talked and listened to my son," David Heber said. "It's all about kindness. It's all about my son being kind and caring about his students that makes this successful."
David Heber also said his son, who was standing just a few feet away from the student who was shot, had been hit in the head with a shot pellet, but was fine and didn't seek treatment for it.
Nonetheless, Ryan Heber will be coping mentally with a difficult situation, his father said, adding his son slept little Thursday night.
"This was a very upsetting incident," David Heber said, describing his son as "emotionally worn out."
"It was hard for him. ... but he's come to the conclusion that he did everything he could do."
Ryan Heber told CNN that it wasn't just his students he was worried about as he faced the gunman -- it was also his wife, who works in the business office of the school, and his two sons, ages 5 and 3, at home.
As the school went into lockdown amid the shooting, Heber's wife texted him from her office, reminding him to lock his classroom door. His response, according to his father, "The shooter is in my room."
Ryan Heber said the ordeal has really made him want to come home to his family.
He said, 'I can handle it.'David Heber, father of teacher Ryan Heber
The Taft shooting is the latest incident of gun violence that launched a fiery national debate over whether teachers should be armed.
Last month the National Rifle Association called on communities to arm teachers or place armed guards in schools as a solution following a Newtown, Connecticut, shooting spree in which a 20-year-old gunman killed seven adults and 20 children at an elementary school.
"The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun," said the NRA's Wayne LaPierre. The idea has been rejected by teacher's groups and mayors, including New York's Michael Bloomberg, Boston's Thomas Menino and Philadelphia's Michael Nutter.
Related: NRA clarifies its stance on arming schools
The debate prompted CNN commenter Adika to weigh in Thursday, saying, "So let me get this straight. The NRA wants to have police officers in schools ... yet an unarmed teacher talked a student into surrendering his gun. Besides being one heck of a hero, that teacher just might have some advice for the NRA."
Another CNN commenter, Frank455444, countered: "Well if the schools are armed and another nut shows up HE GETS SHOT! PROBLEM SOLVED!"
In Utah it's been legal for a dozen years for teachers to be armed in class. Since the law took effect, there have been no school shootings in the state, nor accidents or incidents involving educators' firearms.
Immediately after the Taft shooting Thursday, amid the frenzy of desperate parents coming to the school to retrieve their children, parents expressed concern about school security.
"It just goes to show you that we're going to have to do a lot more to protect our students in this small town," an unidentified parent told KGET. "It might be a small environment, but there's always that one bad apple."

Police target 38 'people of interest' in Madeleine McCann's '07 disappearance
By Laura Smith-Spark, CNN
updated 11:04 AM EDT, Fri July 5, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
UK police identify 38 "people of interest" in connection with Madeleine McCann's vanishing
The 3-year-old disappeared in 2007 from her family's holiday apartment in Portugal
UK police have been reviewing the evidence from the initial investigations
Police: "We continue to believe that there is a possibility that Madeleine is alive"
London (CNN) -- UK officers have identified 38 "people of interest" in connection with the disappearance six years ago in Portugal of British toddler Madeleine McCann, the Metropolitan Police said Thursday.
McCann disappeared while her family was on vacation on the Algarve coast in 2007. She was a few days shy of her 4th birthday at the time she vanished from the family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz.
UK officers who have spent two years reviewing the initial investigations into her disappearance have found "new findings and new witness evidence," a police statement said.
Is Madeleine McCann still alive?
Madeleine McCann investigation reopens
"Our review has now progressed to a position where we have identified 38 persons of interest."
Twelve of those are UK nationals who the police believe were in Portugal at the time the girl went missing.
All the others are European nationals. Metropolitan Police officers are talking to authorities in other countries to get more information about them and their potential involvement, the statement said.
"We continue to believe that there is a possibility that Madeleine is alive," said Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who heads the team.
"It is a positive step in our hunt for Madeleine that our understanding of the evidence has enabled us to shift from review to investigation."

George Zimmerman found not guilty of murder in Trayvon Martin's death
By Greg Botelho and Holly Yan, CNN
updated 11:50 AM EDT, Sun July 14, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS

Martin family attorney: The efforts of millions of supporters are "There are no winners," Zimmerman's brother says The George Zimmerman trial: What happened? What's next? Watch an Anderson Cooper 360 special tonight at 8 ET on CNN.
(CNN) -- George Zimmerman never denied shooting Trayvon Martin, but he said he did so in self defense. Late Saturday night, a Florida jury found him not guilty in the teenager's death.
The verdict caps a case that has inflamed passions for well over a year, much of it focused on race.
The six jurors -- all of them women -- deliberated for 16½ hours. Five of the women are white; one is a minority.
When he heard his fate, Zimmerman had little visible reaction. He turned and shook the hand of one of his attorneys before sitting back down, smiling only after court was adjourned.

Photos: Zimmerman trial
Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, were not in the courtroom when the decision was announced. But they shared their emotions on Twitter shortly afterward.
"Even though I am broken hearted my faith is unshattered I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MY BABY TRAY," Tracy Martin tweeted.
Martin's dad: My heart is broken
Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., said words can't express how relieved his family is.
"Having said that, I don't think this is a time for high-fiving," the brother said. "I acknowledge -- we all have acknowledged -- that Mr. Martin, Trayvon Martin, lost his life. (But) it was not an act of murder. It was not an act of manslaughter."
The decision The jury had three choices: to find Zimmerman guilty of second-degree murder; to find him guilty of a lesser charge of manslaughter; or to find him not guilty.
Defense: Prosecution was 'disgraceful'
Martin lawyer: 'We must all be peaceful'
Defense: Zimmerman did nothing wrong
'Outrage' over Zimmerman verdict
Zimmerman's brother reacts to verdict
Get caught up: Zimmerman trial in 3 mins
Father and son react to verdict For second-degree murder, the jurors would have had to believe that Martin's unlawful killing was "done from ill will, hatred, spite or an evil intent" and would be "of such a nature that the act itself indicates an indifference to human life."
What led jurors to this verdict?
To convict Zimmerman of manslaughter, the jurors would have had to believe he "intentionally committed an act or acts that caused the death of Trayvon Martin." That charge could have carried a sentence of up to 30 years in prison, though the jury was not told of that possible sentence.
Ultimately, they believed Zimmerman wasn't guilty of either charge. None of the jurors wanted to speak to the media after the verdict.
A call for calm Both sides of the case asked for peace after the verdict. In the immediate aftermath, they appeared to have gotten their wish -- even though the Internet erupted with outrage.
But now that Zimmerman is a free man, his defense and his brother fear for his safety.
"He has to be very cautious and protective of his safety because there is still a fringe element who have said, at least in tweets and everything else, that they want revenge -- that they will not listen to a verdict of not guilty," defense attorney Mark O'Mara said.
Anger, sadness but little surprise
Robert Zimmerman Jr. said his brother "is going to be looking around his shoulder for the rest of his life."
When asked if George Zimmerman will keep the gun he used to shoot Trayvon Martin, his brother said he has good reason to.
"I think he has more reason now than ever to think that people are trying to kill him because they express they're trying to kill him, all the time, every day, on my Twitter feed, on the Internet," Robert Zimmerman told CNN's Piers Morgan.
"He has always feared for his safety."
But Crump said everyone should stay calm, especially for Martin's sake.
"For Trayvon to rest in peace, we must all be peaceful."
The race debate
The trial may be over, but the race debate surrounding the case rages on.
"The whole world was looking at this case for a reason ... We'd be intellectually dishonest if we didn't acknowledge the racial undertones in this case," Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump said. "So we have to have very responsible conversations about how we get better as a country and move forward from this tragedy and learn from it."
Prosecutor Angela Corey said Martin was unfairly viewed as a criminal before he was shot.
Analysis: The role that race played
Amid the national debate about whether Zimmerman racially profiled Martin, defense attorney O'Mara suggested his client was actually profiled by critics.
"I think things would have been different if George Zimmerman were black for this reason: He never would have been charged with a crime," O'Mara said.
He said the country "absolutely" needs to have a conversation about whether young black males are treated differently in the criminal justice system -- but said that conversation is a separate topic from what happened the night Zimmerman and Martin met.
Sports stars sound off on verdict
Martin family attorney Natalie Jackson commended the millions of people who signed an online petition "not in an effort to persecute George Zimmerman, but in an effort to say a black 17-year-old child should be able to walk home from the store and not be shot."
She said their efforts were not in vain.
"I don't want them to be discouraged because I think they may have saved the life of another child," Jackson said. "I think that from now on, if there is someone who wants to follow someone with a gun, I think they'll think twice about it."
The fateful night The deadly encounter took place on February 26, 2012, as Martin walked back to his father's fiancee's house through the rain from a Sanford convenience store. The 17-year-old was carrying Skittles and a drink.
Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, spotted him and called police.
A 911 dispatcher told Zimmerman that officers were on the way and not to follow the allegedly suspicious person. But Zimmerman still got out of his car, later telling police he just wanted to get a definitive address to relay to authorities.
Sometime after that, Zimmerman and Martin got into a physical altercation. Questions later arose about who was the aggressor, about whether Martin may have seen or reached for Zimmerman's gun, and about whether Zimmerman should have had more injuries if he was pummeled, as he claims.
Prosecutors never accused Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, of being racist. But they did argue that he wrongly and spitefully prejudged Martin as one of those "f***ing punks," as he's heard saying under his breath in his call to police.
"The defendant didn't shoot Trayvon Martin because he had to," Assistant State Attorney John Guy said. "He shot him because he wanted to. That's the bottom line."
The defense contended that Martin jumped out of some bushes and pounced on Zimmerman as he was walking back toward his car that night, then punched him and slammed his head repeatedly into the concrete sidewalk.
Zimmerman's account of what happened the night of the shooting was a central part of the trial. He was the only living person who witnessed the entire incident, and there wasn't much physical evidence for either team to fall back on.
What's next?
The NAACP has called for the Justice Department to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman and urged the public to sign a petition to support the effort.
Feds are asked to act
"The most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin," the advocacy group said in a statement.
O'Mara said if anyone tries to sue Zimmerman, "we will seek and we will get civil immunity in a civil hearing. And we will see just how many civil lawsuits have spawned from this fiasco."
But for now, both families will reflect and try to move forward.
"Trayvon Martin will forever remain in the annals of history next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till as symbols for the fight for equal justice for all," Crump said.
When asked what he has to say to Trayvon Martin's parents, Robert Zimmerman Jr. said he understands their pain.
"There are no winners. They will not win or lose anything more than they already have lost, which is their son's life, by any kind of verdict for George," Robert Zimmerman said. "I applaud them for asking for the verdict to be respected. ... And I will pray for them."
