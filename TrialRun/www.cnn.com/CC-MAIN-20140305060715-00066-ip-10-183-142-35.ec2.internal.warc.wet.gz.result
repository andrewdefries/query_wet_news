Why McCain talks to the media ... and why he didn'tStory Highlights King: John McCain "most consistently accessible candidate" to news media Exception was McCain's anger about cartoon depicting his wife, says ex-aide Ex-aide: Furious McCain said, "We're done. We're not talking to them anymore" Next Article in Politics » Read PHOTOS QUIZ TIMELINE By John King CNN Chief National Correspondent WASHINGTON (CNN) -- This is my sixth presidential campaign, and without a doubt John McCain is the most consistently accessible candidate when it comes to the news media. Sen. John McCain's availability to the media has advantages and disadvantages, says a former aide.more photos » Daily "availabilities" are a staple of the senator's schedule; often these are held on his campaign plane or bus, sometimes just at the edge of the press area in the back of the room after a speech or town hall meeting. It is unquestionably part of his political appeal -- even critics applaud his willingness to take questions on any subject. Some of these same critics also suggest McCain gets more favorable press because he is so accessible, and because he so clearly enjoys both the serious exchanges and playful banter that punctuate his relationship with the media. It is nothing new. He "always enjoyed it," says Torie Clarke -- who was McCain's press secretary in 1983, when he was a freshman House member from Arizona or, as she put it, "a brand new, baby freshman congressman." But campaign staffers, then and now, don't always like it, because making candidates accessible to reporters puts candidates in danger of being -- to borrow the Washington jargon -- "knocked off message." See photos of McCain campaigning » That's when candidates are persuaded to talk about other issues during a day when campaign staffers want the candidate to focus solely on something else deemed more critical. Clarke, though, says McCain's political success is proof his instincts are good. Don't Miss In Depth: McCain & Obama Revealed

The night that changed McCain's life
"Ninety-five percent of the time that very forward leading, out front kind of attitude serves him very well," says Clarke. "Five percent of the time he can say something completely outrageous and that's when you wish somebody had told him to be a little more careful." There are exceptions to McCain's approach, and one stands out more than any other. Test your knowledge about McCain » In 1994, the senator's wife, Cindy McCain, acknowledged her battle with an addiction to prescription painkillers. Among her revelations was that she had diverted -- for her personal use -- drugs that were intended for a medical charity she ran. The charity helped poor and disadvantaged children around the world. The Arizona Republic, McCain's hometown newspaper, published an editorial cartoon that showed Cindy McCain stealing medication from the mouth of a poor infant. "I thought that that cartoon was gratuitous and obviously offensive," John McCain told CNN in one of three sessions he spent with us to discuss his life and career. "I'm very confident and proud of Cindy that she has overcome this and gone on to do some very good things in her life and this world." Reminded of the cartoon, Clarke says: "He was furious. ... He found me instantly and was just absolutely furious. ...He just said, 'I want nothing to do with these people -- I want nothing to do with them. .... That's it. We're done. We're not talking to them anymore.' " That boycott lasted a year, says Clarke. McCain himself refused to talk to anyone at the newspaper, whether they worked in Washington or Arizona, for the news department or the editorial page. His staff knew it wasn't a boycott meant just for the senator. "It was well understood you don't talk to them," Clarke says. Some people may describe that behavior as silly or irrational, says Clarke. But "understand the emotions," she explains. "Impractical as it was for McCain to act the way he did, by saying, 'I'm a senator from Arizona, but I'm going to blackball the biggest newspaper in the state,' ... God bless him for being that angry on behalf of his wife."

23 injured as Spain ski chairlift breaksStory Highlights Spain: Ski chairlift breaks at resort in southern Spain on Monday At least 23 people injured, the Sierra Nevada resort said Four people were listed in a serious conditionNext Article in World » MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A chairlift broke on Monday morning, sending skiers into the snowy hillside at a ski resort in southern Spain, according to the Sierra Nevada resort. At least 23 skiers riding the lift were injured, the resort said on its Web site. The resort, near the city of Granada, said the problem stemmed from a hanging arm-type device, which connects the lift chairs to the cable. CNN partner station CNN+ reported that the cable broke, causing the skiers to fall six to eight meters (19 to 25 feet) to the ground. The skiers suffered fractures and contusions, although it was unclear how many were taken to hospitals. Four were listed in serious condition, CNN+ reported from the scene. None of the injuries was considered life threatening, the resort said in the brief statement about the incident posted on its Web site.

Let Manti Te'o be the end of sports hero worship
By Howard Kurtz, CNN Contributor
updated 9:34 AM EST, Sat January 26, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Manti Te'o saga is the latest of a series of embarrassing failures by journalists
Howard Kurtz says reporters covering sports can't fall victim to hero worship
People in news business are accustomed to being lied to, Kurtz says
Kurtz: It's time for aggressive and tough-minded sports reporting
Editor's note: Howard Kurtz is the host of CNN's "Reliable Sources" and is Newsweek's Washington bureau chief. He is also a contributor to the website Daily Download.
(CNN) -- We in the media seem to be dealing with a whole lotta liars:
A college football star who told the world he had met his imaginary girlfriend. A cycling champion who lied about doping for a decade. A coach who abused boys and covered it up.
Howard Kurtz
And that's just from the wide world of sports.
What's clear, as these stories have unfolded, is that journalists don't possess lie-detector machines. But they do have BS detectors. And these are apparently getting rusty.
Take the case of Manti Te'o, who confessed to Katie Couric in an interview broadcast Thursday that, well, he kinda made up the minor detail that he had met his imaginary girlfriend. He was "going to be put on national TV" after saying that the girlfriend had died, Te'o told Couric. "You know, what would you do?"
Um, tell the truth?
Opinion: Te'o story, big fail for sportswriters
We still don't know whether the Notre Dame star was in on the hoax earlier. But we do know he didn't want to ruin the heartwarming story line that the media utterly swallowed -- that his play was inspired by the girlfriend's demise.
Couric, by the way, did a masterful job of poking holes in Te'o's tale while also expressing empathy for a troubled young man.
Hear voice mail left by Te'o 'girlfriend'
Hear voice mail left by Te'o 'girlfriend'
Manti Te'o's own words
Yet the lack of journalistic skepticism on this heartwarming tale of tragedy was stunning. No one had seen the girlfriend. Te'o said he mainly communicated with her online. There were no pictures of them together.
Watch: How Katie Couric artfully exposed Manti Te'o
The malfeasance was even worse after Lennay Kekua's alleged death. Pete Thamel of Sports Illustrated has acknowledged that he ignored a number of red flags. No obituary for Kekua. No funeral notice. No record of what Te'o described as an earlier car accident. No mention of her in Lexis Nexis. No record of her brother's name so he could spellcheck it. But he went ahead and published anyway, as did CBS, ESPN and others, to the shame of the sports journalism world.
Once there were rumblings that Kekua might not exist, ESPN was chasing that story but, after an internal debate, the network held off while trying to get an interview with Te'o, according to The New York Times. The hope of access trumped the investigative reporting, so the hoax was exposed by the snarky but solid sports blog Deadspin.
Watch: New York Post mocks Hillary's anger at Benghazi hearing
Lance Armstrong was another case study in deception and deceit. In the early years, as he won one Tour de France after another, virtually no one in the media wanted to mar the story line of the guy who overcame cancer and kept piling up championships. He said he never took banned substances -- wasn't that good enough? Didn't sportswriters hope to get the next Lance interview?
Obviously the story line about drug use grew in recent years as former teammates hurled allegations, and U.S. anti-doping officials mounted an investigation that would wind up stripping Armstrong of his titles. Finally, of course, he went to Oprah Winfrey and said he'd been lying all along.
Even so, some of his media defenders were less than outraged. Washington Post sportswriter Sally Jenkins told Charlie Rose that Armstrong had called her:
"He said he was sorry for misleading me. He said he was sorry -- and this is a very small thing -- but he expressed that he was sorry that my reputation had taken a hit because of my association with him, which I appreciated. And it wasn't a very long conversation, but it was a meaningful one to me."
Watch: Paula Broadwell and media redemption
Jenkins said she wasn't mad at Armstrong and that "that there's a level of anger at Lance that is out of proportion to the offense of doping."
I'm not feeling as charitable. I'm angry because Lance lied.
As for the Penn State debacle, it's hard to deny that the worship of college football blinded the media to the notion that the sainted Joe Paterno might do anything wrong -- such as looking the other way after allegations that his assistant, Jerry Sandusky, was sexually abusing children. This sickening scandal unfolded under the nose of the sports media establishment until it was exposed by a local reporter, Sara Ganim of the Patriot-News in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. (Ganim now works at CNN.)
We in the news business are accustomed to being misled and misinformed by politicians and their operatives. We've been through too many scandals to believe otherwise. And while we sometimes fall down on the job, we bring to the political arena a certain battle-hardened skepticism.
Watch: Beyonce lip-synced -- oh well
The tradition has always been that sports is different, a kind of protected zone where athletes compete and no amount of spin can alter their performance on the field. Hero worship was baked into the cake, especially when covering local teams.
If that was once true, it's hardly the case now in the era of steroids and strikes and lockouts and violence, as was sadly underscored when Jovan Belcher of the Kansas City Chiefs fatally shot his girlfriend and himself, and Bob Costas was skewered for talking about the NFL's gun culture.
The notion that today's sports journalism can be anything other than aggressive and tough-minded is now as fictional as Manti Te'o's imaginary girlfriend.

Do we want to die tethered to a machine?
By Stephan A. Mayer, Special to CNN
updated 2:14 PM EDT, Thu July 18, 2013
A resident of a Colorado hospice is comforted. In hospice, dying people are kept comfortable without extreme intervention.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Stephan Mayer: Critically ill for five weeks, Mandela makes us think of how we want to die
Mayer: There's an epidemic of people suffering as they die hooked up to machines
He says we deny death, are scared, don't want loved ones to go, allow medicine to prolong life
Mayer: One day you might need to decide when to allow someone you love to die
Editor's note: Stephan A. Mayer is director of the Neurological Intensive Care Unit at Columbia University Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York.
(CNN) -- Life is difficult. Death used to be simple. You simply died, and that was it. Now, in the modern era of high-tech medicine, death is difficult, too.
The predicament facing Nelson Mandela, who has been critically ill for the past five weeks and turns 95 on Thursday, brings into sharp focus an important question that eventually affects all of us. How do we want to die?
Mandela is one of the most influential and important people on Earth, but nothing about his situation is unique or special. Intensivists -- those doctors who specialize in intensive care patients -- will tell you that every day thousands of people all over the world are going through the same thing. Playing out the end game, many of them are stuck on a ventilator with a slim to vanishing chance of ever getting back to the life they knew and loved.
Stephan Mayer
Modern society is confronting a tragic, silent epidemic of frail elderly people who suffer needlessly at the end of life because of unwanted life support. These folks are effectively left to die a slow death connected to machines. As a critical care specialist who has seen this process play out many times, it can be agonizing to witness.
How did we end up here? Why has death become so complicated?
Modern medicine is powerful, but it is a double-edged sword. The way we can bring people back from the brink of death is truly amazing. There is nothing more satisfying professionally than having a grateful patent walk back into the ICU after surviving a near-death experience. But more often, for very old people, aggressive life support doesn't work out so well. Prolonged ICU care often gradually evolves into a checkmate situation.
Intensivists know what it usually means when the condition of an elderly person hospitalized for weeks is described as "critical but stable." After weeks of aggressive support, the patient still cannot survive off the ventilator.

When this happens, the muscles start to wither away from a condition called ICU-acquired myopathy. Little may seem to be happening, but as the body inevitably continues to weaken, a relentless series of secondary complications will ensue, such as pneumonia, delirium and failure of the circulatory system or kidneys. In most cases, patients need to be continuously sedated to minimize obvious pain and suffering.
When do you stop? How do you stop? And who decides? These are the wrenching issues that confront the family. The fundamental question is this: When is it time to accept the inevitability of death, change the goal of care to comfort, and let the patient have peace?
It used to be that doctors struggled with withdrawing life support, or wouldn't even consider it. At the height of the Jack Kevorkian era in the mid-1990s the chairman of our hospital ethics committee, a good friend and colleague, told me that withdrawing life support should always be difficult and make me uncomfortable. I couldn't have agreed less, but I didn't tell him.
Thankfully over the years, his views and those of most physicians have changed. Unlike my generation, medical students are now trained in ethics and palliative care. More patients have advance directives and living wills. Every intensivist will tell you that withdrawing life support and helping someone "make the transition" with comfort and dignity is one of the most satisfying and useful things that they can do. But despite this progress, there is still a fundamental disconnect. The epidemic of futile support at the end-of-life persists.
The major reason is a perfect storm created by the power of modern medical technology, our cultural emphasis on patient autonomy and the innate human tendency to deny and hide from the reality of death.
Death is scary and makes us uncomfortable. Modern culture has insulated us from witnessing death. We are out of touch with the life cycle. We deny death.
We also believe that the patient should call the shots and get the care he or she wants. But what happens when the patient can no longer express his or her wishes? Spouses, children and family are forced to make life-and-death decisions that they never volunteered to make, sometimes may not be equipped to make, or unrealistically assumed they would never have to make. But make no mistake: Unless death is sudden, one day you will need to decide when to allow someone you love to die, and someone will have to make that decision for you.
Intensivists often hear this: "I know my dad wouldn't want this, but I just can't bring myself to do it." Advance directives or a living will do not necessarily mean you will get the end-of-life care that you want. This is because withdrawing life support depends on your decision-makers, usually your loved ones, understanding and believing that you are past the point of no return. It depends on accepting death.
Mandela fought for freedom all of his life, and the world does not want to lose him. Now all we can hope for is that he is comfortable, and getting the care that he would want. If and when the day comes that he has fought long enough, it will be OK to let him be free.

Reno to Jewell: 'I regret the leak'
July 31, 1997
Web posted at: 12:13 p.m. EDT (1613 GMT)
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Attorney General Janet Reno expressed personal regret Thursday over a leak to the news media that cited Richard Jewell as a suspect in the Centennial Olympic Park bombing and led to months of intense public scrutiny of his life.
"I'm very sorry it happened," Reno said during her weekly news conference. "I think we owe him an apology. I regret the leak."
There has been no information made public as to who leaked Jewell's name.
The attorney general said she had not sent Jewell a formal written apology, but would be happy to talk with him.
Asked what she would say to Jewell if they met face-to-face, Reno said, "I would tell him I'm sorry."
Jewell discovered the bomb shortly before it exploded in Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta on July 27, 1996. The blast killed one person and injured 100. After being hailed a hero, he quickly became a lead suspect.
Following three months of intense FBI and media scrutiny, the FBI sent Jewell a letter last fall clearing him of any involvement in the blast.
On Wednesday, Jewell testified before a House subcommittee in which he called for an independent probe into methods used by FBI agents during their investigation of him.
Since he was exonerated, Jewell has maintained that the FBI and the Atlanta newspapers that first identified him as a suspect owe him a public apology.
