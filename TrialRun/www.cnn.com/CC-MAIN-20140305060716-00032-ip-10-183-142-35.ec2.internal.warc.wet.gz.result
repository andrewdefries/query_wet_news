Bill Clinton: I should have better regulated derivativesStory Highlights Obama did everything he could to get GOP support for stimulus bill, Clinton says Public will support Obama at least a year as he tries to work things out, Clinton says He says wife consulted him and others ahead of her stop in China Clinton says times in which he governed most like those of Theodore Roosevelt Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Former President Bill Clinton was in Austin, Texas, over the weekend to host the Clinton Global Initiative University, which encourages college students and administrators to come up with creative ways to address global issues. Former President Bill Clinton praises the Obama administration's handling of the stimulus bill. CNN's John Roberts sat down with Clinton to ask him about how the Obama administration is performing, how his wife, Hillary Clinton, is doing as secretary of state, and what responsibility he may have for the current financial crisis. John Roberts: Mr. President, in terms of the overall economic downturn, Time magazine had an article out this week in which it named 25 of the people most responsible for the economic downturn, and you were there. They, they had a picture of you in what looked like a police lineup. They had a little button where you could vote who's the most responsible? They pointed to your signing of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. I wonder what you think about that. Former President Bill Clinton: I think that the only thing that our administration did or didn't do that we should have done is to try to set in motion some more formal regulation of the derivatives market. They're wrong in saying that the elimination of the Glass-Steagall division between banks and investment banks contributed to this. Investment banks were already...banks were already doing investment business and investment companies were already in the banking business. The bill I signed actually at least puts some standards there. And if you look at the evidence of the banks that have gotten in trouble, the ones that were most directly involved in there ... in a diversified portfolio tended to do better. Some of the conservatives said that I was responsible because I enforced the Community Reinvestment Act, and they said that's what made all these subprime mortgages be issued. That's also false. The community banks, the people that loan their money in the community instead of buying these esoteric securities, they're doing quite well. Watch Clinton defend his economic record » Roberts: So what's your take on what Sen. [John] McCain said, that [President] Obama is off to a terrible start?

Holbrooke: India, Pakistan, U.S. face same threat
Clinton: I just disagree with him, but we have a different economic philosophy. For example, there's 100 economic studies which show that you get a better return in terms of economic growth on extending unemployment benefits or investing money in energy conservation jobs to improve buildings than you do giving people in my income group a tax cut. But it doesn't stop them. Those guys are on automatic. You punch a button and they give the answer they give you. There are a lot of tax cuts in that bill -- for middle-class families, for lower-income families. There's a $7,500 tax credit that will kick in when these plug-in electric vehicles go on the market, which could help us to become the world's leader in that and secure us jobs for a decade or more. Roberts: Do you really think the president can change Washington? Can he bring the type of change to Washington that he campaigned on? He's already up against a wall against the Republicans in Congress -- not quite as big a wall as you found yourself up against in 1993, but he does seem to be having some difficulty. Do you think he really can bring change to Washington? Clinton on 'King'

Clinton: Here's what I think will happen. I think that as we go along, if the American people stick with him and if he begins to have good results, then I think more and more Republicans will cooperate with him because they will see that he's right or because he carried their states or for any number of reasons. Roberts: How long do you think he has? Clinton: First, his next big challenge is to come forward with the details of how we're going to rewrite as many home mortgages as we can. How we're going to take some of these bad assets off the banks' books so they can get cleaned up and they can loan money and what conditions will we give more money to banks for. In other words, they're going to have to loan money from now on. That's what [Treasury] Secretary [Timothy] Geithner is working on. Those three things make a lot of sense. That's our long-term answer. Roberts: But how much time do you think he has? A hundred days, six months, a year, two years? Clinton: The public, I believe, will support him at least for a year in trying to work these things out. And he's been very straight forward in saying it might take as much as two years for the economy to really get in gear again. My instinct is it will happen a little quicker than that. Roberts: What do you think of the job that President Obama did on steering the stimulus plan through Congress, and does he in fact have the experience necessary to be a good president, reach across party lines and craft a bipartisan bill? Clinton: Well first of all, he has reached across, and it takes two to tango. I find it amazing that the Republicans who doubled the debt of the country in eight years and produced no new jobs doing it, gave us an economic record that was totally bereft of any productive result are now criticizing him for spending money. You know, I'm a fiscal conservative, I balanced the budget, I ran surpluses. If I were in his position today, I would be doing what he's doing. Why? Because the problem with the economy is the housing decline led to the general decline in values. Assets are going down. This stimulus is our bridge over troubled waters till the bank reforms kick in. He did the right thing, he did everything he could to get Republican support. He took some of their tax-cutting ideas. But if you look at this bill, it is designed do three things. And it does all three. It puts money in the hands of people who need money to survive -- unemployment benefits, food stamp benefits, tax cuts. Second thing it does is to give money to state and local governments so they don't have to lay a million people off or raise taxes. Either one would be bad for the economy. The third thing is it does is create new jobs. Given the Congress he had and the environment and the speed with which they had to move, I think he did a fine job with this. Roberts: Your wife is on a big trip over to the Far East, talking with the leaders of China. She's going to be taking on the North Korea issue. There's been some talk in the last week that with the appointment of all of these high profile envoys, from Richard Holbrooke to South Asia, George Mitchell to the Middle East, Dennis Ross in the same area, Vice President Joe Biden out there talking about foreign policy, that maybe she might get a little bit elbowed out here when she it comes to the big projects. Are you concerned about that? Do you talk to her about that? Clinton: No. I'm not concerned about it. And these envoys are her idea, both the idea of the envoys and the people who were selected. She thinks that Joe Biden has got one of the best foreign policy minds and certainly some of the most important foreign policy experience we've had. Let me remind you when I was president, Al Gore had special relationships with both Russia and South Africa. And it didn't undermine the authority of either Warren Christopher or Madeleine Albright as secretary of state. The reason they're doing this, and the reason the president agreed to support it -- and he came to the State Department to support the announcements of Holbrooke and Mitchell -- is that they all want to get off to a fast start and you've got to do a lot of things at once. It's inconceivable that she could devote the time and detailed attention right now to having a diplomatic strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan that exactly parallels the military strategy that [the head of U.S. General Command] Gen. [David] Petraeus has or figures out how to start the Middle East peace negotiations again and what the timetable is and do all this other stuff. So as long as they're working on a team and nobody is playing sharp elbows and this is a team -- these guys have got a team concept. The president has made it clear he wants everybody to be on the team, they all report in to her as well as to him. They're all working together. I'm very impressed by that. I think that she made a judgment that we needed in the country's interest to do everything at once. And I think she's right. Clinton says U.S. envoys are part of a team » Roberts: Of course, bilateral relations between the United States and China, a big focus of your administration, did you talk to her at all about this trip? Clinton: Sure I did. Just like she consulted with a lot of people, we talked about it. I told her what my take on the Chinese is and especially in light of the fact that I work there now in AIDS, I have a big AIDS project there. And I know how they think economically and I think she'll do quite well there. I think she made a really good decision obviously, she had to go to Japan and south Korea, but going to Indonesia, the word's biggest Muslim country, sends a loud signal because Indonesia has a part of it, Bali, which is predominantly Hindu, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks. It's a good deal, I mean the whole thing, it's the right place to start. Roberts: A couple of real quick questions, what president do you think you're most like? Clinton: Well, personally, I'm not sure. One guy wrote a book saying I was most like Thomas Jefferson, but the times in which I governed were most like Theodore Roosevelt. And the results I received were similar. He had enormous success, the country was better off when he quit than when he started, but several of the things he recommended were not actually done until his cousin, Franklin Roosevelt, became president more than 20 years later. I think a lot of things that I recommended in terms of health care reform will come to fruition now that we have more modern Democratic Congress and a new Democratic Congress and the Obama administration there. I'll be surprised if we don't get health care reform and some of the things I recommended. I'm excited about it.

Ron Paul hits government oil spill efforts; defends GOP chairmanFrom Kevin Bohn, CNN Senior Producer Rep. Paul talks about GOP riftsSTORY HIGHLIGHTSRon Paul's congressional district includes Galveston, where tar balls washed ashorePaul: Federal government has "done a lot to interfere" in Gulf spill cleanupNational Guard units should be aiding in cleanup, not "fighting wars we don't need," says PaulPaul defends GOP chairman who labeled Afghanistan war "Obama's choosing" Washington (CNN) -- With the first tar balls from the Gulf oil spill now washing ashore in Galveston, Texas, Rep. Ron Paul, whose district includes the affected area, said Monday the federal government is not doing enough in the recovery effort. "They have done a lot to interfere," Paul told National Political Correspondent Jessica Yellin on CNN's "John King USA." He said local residents and state officials in Louisiana and Mississippi have complained that some federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Fish and Wildlife Service, have not acted quickly enough to relax some regulations to fast-track recovery initiatives. Federal officials have previously defended their efforts. Another area of criticism by Paul concerned the deployment of National Guard troops to help in the cleanup. "If all our states had their Guard units back here maybe they would have the manpower to do more to help clean up the beaches and prevent the oil from coming in, but, no, our Guard units are all over the world fighting wars we don't need," said Paul, a critic of the U.S. deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. While 17,500 National Guard troops from Gulf Coast states have been authorized to respond to the crisis, currently 1,577 are active, according to the Obama administration. Paul has been one of the few the national Republican leaders to come out in support of embattled Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele after Steele told a fundraiser last week the Afghanistan war was "a war of Obama's choosing" and suggested it was not winnable. Many national Republicans immediately called for Steele's resignation, pointing out it was in direct contradiction to what they believed, especially since the war started under President George W. Bush after the September 11, 2001, attacks. "He did not deserve to be punished through the media in a sense that, 'Get out, we don't want you. We don't need you.' I think the party is doing reasonably well," Paul said on the program. The former GOP presidential candidate disagreed with his colleagues Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who over the weekend blasted Steele and his comments, calling them inaccurate, uninformed and unwise. "Millions of Americans feel frustrated. This war has gone on too long, cost us too much money, cost us billions of dollars, cost us thousands of casualties," Paul said. "People are tired of the war, and it is going badly." Paul finds himself in unusual company. A USA Today-Gallup Poll last week showed 66 percent of Republicans supported the war while only 27 percent of Democrats did. The eleven-term congressman said he has not spoken to Steele since the controversy erupted. Asked about criticism that his son, Rand, has received since winning the GOP nomination for the open Senate seat in Kentucky, Ron Paul said, "He got some bad raps... I guess I didn't warn him enough and prepare him enough." Rand Paul found himself in the middle of firestorms after criticizing the 1964 Civil Rights Act, calling President Barack Obama's criticism of Gulf oil well owner BP "un-American" and holding a recent fundraiser in Washington, D.C., which was criticized by some Tea Party members. Some of the members of Congress listed on the invitation as part of the welcome committee for the event voted for the 2008 financial bailout known as TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program). One of Paul's major campaign themes was his opposition to that initiative. "You can expect it after you win a primary... and beat the estabilshment. You can sort of expect something," is how the elder Paul Monday reacted to some of the criticism weathered by his son. Rand Paul, whose primary race had drawn a large amount of support from Tea Party activists both in the state and nationwide, had run as an anti-Washington candidate in the primary, beating the incumbent Kentucky secretary of state who had won the backing of many state party leaders. Ron Paul said he has refrained from offering his son advice. "I let him run his own campaign," he added.

U.S. soldier charged in infant's death By Katie Silver, CNN Pfc. Jeffrey Sliker, 23, earned recognition for meritorious service while in Afghanistan. STORY HIGHLIGHTSA decorated U.S. Army soldier allegedly admits killing a 4-month-old baby girlPfc. Jeffrey Sliker was charged in the death of Laurne Clark, also known as Mollie SlikerAn autopsy revealed blunt force trauma to the skull as the cause of deathThe suspect's brother says he can't believe Sliker was responsible for the death New York (CNN) -- A decorated U.S. Army soldier allegedly admitted he killed a 4-month-old girl he and his wife were trying to adopt, police said Friday. Pfc. Jeffrey Sliker was charged in the death of Laurne Clark, also known as Mollie Sliker, after police responded to a call from the couple's house on Wednesday, according to Julie Call, a court spokeswoman in Watertown, New York. Police say they found the infant with no obvious external injuries, but an autopsy later revealed blunt force trauma to the skull as the cause of death, according to Watertown Police spokesman Frank Derrigo. Upon questioning, Sliker allegedly admitted causing the injury, Derrigo said. Sliker's brother, James, says he can't believe his brother was responsible for the infant's death. "I don't see him ever trying to hurt someone, especially his own daughter." he told CNN affiliate WWNY. "I just don't understand what happened. He's not the brother that I know." The 23-year-old suspect earned recognition for meritorious service while in Afghanistan. He was arraigned Friday morning in Watertown City Court and is being held without bail. Sliker's attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. Sliker is expected to face a preliminary hearing in Jefferson County Court early next week.

John Brennan, Obama's counterterrorist
By Peter Bergen, CNN National Security Analyst
updated 1:35 PM EST, Thu February 7, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
John Brennan is up for a confirmation hearing before the Senate on Thursday
The nominee for CIA director has been at the center of Obama's counterterrorism policies
Peter Bergen says Brennan's been key in the drone program and in the bin Laden raid
Bergen: Brennan supported the raid while Biden and Gates argued against it
Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad," and a director at the New America Foundation.
(CNN) -- When Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Robert Gates advised President Barack Obama in late April 2011 that sending a Navy SEAL team into Pakistan to capture or kill Osama bin Laden was not worth the various risks that this operation entailed, John Brennan, the president's top counterterrorism adviser, urged the president to authorize the raid.
It's that kind of call that has made Brennan the president's go-to guy since the beginning of Obama's first term on all matters related to terrorism and has also thrust him into a broader policymaking role in the Middle East and in South Asia.
From his windowless office deep in the bowels of the West Wing a few steps from the Situation Room, Brennan has been at the center of every important decision in the war against al Qaeda.
Peter Bergen
Brennan is a serious, taciturn man who grew up in New Jersey and attended Fordham University in New York, where at one point he contemplated becoming a priest. Instead, he joined the CIA and spent more than two decades in the shadows, rising to take on important positions such as Bill Clinton's intelligence briefer and CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia.
Three years after 9/11, Brennan became the first director of the National Counterterrorism Center, which shapes overall strategy against al Qaeda and its allies across the 16 agencies of the U.S. intelligence community.
After he retired, Brennan went into the private sector, where he played an early role in advising the Obama campaign in the run-up to the 2008 election.

It's this long history with Obama and his depth of experience in the intelligence community that have made Brennan the president's pick to run the CIA.
Facing tough questions
On Thursday, Brennan will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, a milestone on the road to what is shaping up to be a contentious confirmation to be CIA director.
At his confirmation hearing, Brennan will be asked some tough questions about the administration's policies on CIA drone strikes, policies that he has played a key role in formulating.
Taking even the most conservative estimate of casualties during Brennan's time as Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, CIA drone strikes in Pakistan have killed 1,577 people, 143 of whom were identified in credible news reports as civilians, according to a count by the New America Foundation.
Brennan will also likely be asked to discuss the still-classified Senate Intelligence Committee's three-year investigation into the CIA detainee program and the extent to which coercive interrogations of some of those CIA-held prisoners elicited useful information.
The head of the committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, has said that coercive interrogations did not provide key leads in tracking down bin Laden, while a number of retired senior CIA officials have claimed that they did.
Targeting American terrorists overseas
2011: Brennan briefs on bin Laden raid
Undoubtedly, this discrepancy will be something that the committee will want to delve into with Brennan.
Opinion: Bring drones out of the shadows
Role in the raid
Perhaps more than any other official, he played a key role in what has surely been the Obama administration's greatest success overseas: tracking bin Laden to an obscure city in Pakistan and then formulating the overall plan that led to the death of al Qaeda's leader.
In August 2010, CIA Director Leon Panetta went to the White House to brief the president and a handful of his top national security advisers, including Brennan, that the CIA had a promising lead that suggested bin Laden could be living in a compound in the northern city of Abbottabad.
The case that bin Laden was living there was entirely circumstantial and was based on the fact that residing at the Abbottabad compound was a longtime al Qaeda insider and that he and the other people living in the compound were taking elaborate measures to deceive their neighbors about their identities.
One of the mysterious residents at the compound was a man who never left the compound's grounds and could be seen by U.S. satellites occasionally taking a quick walk in the garden. He would come to be nicknamed "the pacer." However, the CIA could never get a photograph of the pacer's face, nor was there any other definitive intelligence that bin Laden was living at the compound.
Brennan, who had spent almost all of his working life at the CIA, met regularly with the analysts working on the bin Laden case. According to senior White House officials, Brennan pushed the analysts to come up with intelligence that disproved the notion that bin Laden was living in the Abbottabad compound, explaining, "I'm tired of hearing why everything you say confirms your case. What we need to look for are the things that tell us what's not right about our theory. So what's not right about your inferences?"
The analysts working on the bin Laden hunt came back to the White House one day and started their intelligence update, saying, "Looks like there's a dog on the compound."
Denis McDonough, Obama's then-deputy national security adviser, remembers thinking, "Oh, that's a bummer. You know, no self-respecting Muslim's gonna have a dog." (Many Muslims believe dogs to be "unclean.")
Brennan, who had spent much of his career focused on the Middle East and speaks Arabic, pointed out that bin Laden, in fact, did have dogs when he was living in Sudan in the mid-1990s. (Indeed, when al Qaeda's leader was living in the capital of Khartoum, he had taken an interest in training police dogs.)
Report: Numerous countries involved in CIA interrogation programs
Creation of the "Red Team"
In addition to pushing the CIA to refine its analysis of the case that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad, two weeks before Obama made the final decision to launch the Navy SEAL raid, Brennan authorized the formation of a "Red Team." It was made up of four intelligence analysts who had had no prior role in making the case that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad.
The role of the Red Team was to see if there were alternative explanations that could explain the "pattern of life" of the mysterious residents of the Abbottabad compound. For instance: Could they be the retinue of some drug lord who was keeping a low profile? Or might they be on the fringes of al Qaeda but unrelated to bin Laden himself?
On Thursday, April 28, 2011, during the final National Security Council meeting to discuss what to do in Abbottabad, the Red Team briefed the president and his top advisers.
One of the Red Team analysts put the odds that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad at 40%, which was discomfiting to some.
Brennan recalls: "Some of us thought, 'Whoa! We thought the prospects were higher that he was in there.' And the president recognized that when people were saying, 'Well, there's only 40% of a chance,' that some people were going to get a little bit soft on this."
Was it too risky?
The uncertainty that bin Laden was even living in Abbottabad contributed to the advice that Biden and Gates gave Obama during this final National Security Council meeting: Don't authorize the SEAL team raid. It's just too risky.
By now, Brennan had come to a very different conclusion.
He had already told the president privately the CIA officials who had developed the intelligence on Abbottabad were "the people that have been following bin Laden for 15 years. This has been their life's work, this has been their life's journey, and they feel it very much in their gut that bin Laden is at that compound. I feel pretty good, if not certain, that bin Laden is at that compound."
Brennan urged a go on the raid.
As the SEAL raid unfolded in Abbottabad on May 1, 2011, Brennan was as anxious as anyone else in the White House Situation Room: "Might there be a quick reaction force that bin Laden may have had, security that we didn't know about?" he recalled thinking.
The raid, of course, succeeded.
When photos of the dead Osama bin Laden were passed around the Situation Room, Brennan nodded and said, "It's bin Laden."

Be a guest of Katmai's brown bears
By Matthew Casey, Special to CNN
updated 11:02 AM EDT, Thu June 27, 2013
Katmai has the bears that will make you gasp. Stop by again next week for Gettsyburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania.
Brown bears are the same species as grizzly bears. Keep at least a 50-yard distance from all bears in Katmai, and never separate a mother from her cub. Park ranger Roy Wood, seen here at Brooks Falls, has worked at Katmai National Park and Preserve since 2003.
The crater lake in the collapsed summit of Mount Katmai was formed by the Novarupta volcano's 1912 eruption.
Brooks Falls is a favorite salmon fishing hole for brown bears during the summer.
The salmon run draws anywhere from 70 to 100 brown bears to a one-mile area of Brooks Camp, says Wood. Can you find the wolf in the background?
Mount Martin, on the edge of the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, is one of Katmai's most active volcanoes.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Katmai's 4 million acres are home to more than 2,100 brown bears
Always maintain a 50-yard distance from bears and never separate a mother from her cub
The 1912 Novarupta volcano eruption was the largest of the 20th century
The eruption created the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, 40 square miles of volcanic ash Editor's note: CNN.com's weekly Summer in the Park series turns to rangers at the United States' most popular national parks to get insider recommendations for your visits, whether you have just one day or can stay longer. The series will run through Labor Day.
(CNN) -- A brown bear cub clumsily splashes into the Brooks River to receive his mom's first fishing lesson. Those too-big-for-his body paws will be perfect for catching sockeye salmon, which started running the river in late June.
Witnessing this passing of ancient knowledge to the next generation is a once in a lifetime opportunity -- from at least 50 yards away, as the mother bear is as dangerous and unforgiving as the rest of Mother Nature's Alaskan creations.
These bears live on the head of the Alaskan Peninsula, which is the gateway to the chain of Aleutian Islands, formed by ancient volcanic eruptions that built the geography that eventually made region habitable for human beings.
The 1912 eruption of the Novarupta volcano was the largest of the 20th century, and four years later, the National Geographic Society sent Robert F. Griggs to explore the bottomless lakes, soaring mountains and impenetrable forests of what would become Katmai National Park and Preserve.
Griggs' prize was the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, Novarupta's 40-square-mile stretch of then still-smoldering volcanic ash that ranged from 100 to 700 feet deep. Katmai, a national monument since 1918 and a national park since 1980, gives visitors the opportunity to see the wilderness as Griggs saw it, to witness bears, moose, eagles and salmon within the floral beauty and rugged expanse of Alaska.
Park stats: In great part because of its remoteness, tourists didn't begin regularly visiting Katmai until the 1950s. The 4-million acre park has averaged about 39,000 visitors a year since 2008, according to the park service. About 10,000 people visit Katmai in July to view the bears at Brooks Camp, says park ranger Roy Wood.
Summer in the Park: Great Smoky Mountains
The location: Katmai is on the Alaskan Peninsula, and park headquarters is in King Salmon. Visitors can get to the park via plane or boat, but there is no road access. There are daily commercial flights from Anchorage to King Salmon, about a 290-mile trip. Travelers can also access Katmai from Kodiak, Iliamna, Soldotna or Homer. Visitors can also charter flights and boat rides within the park, including the 30-mile ride from King Salmon to Brooks Camp.
If you go: Getting to Katmai is the hardest part, says Wood. But admission to the park is free. However, there is a camping fee for staying at Brooks Camp, and you will need a permit to do commercial filming or photography.
Summer in the Park: Grand Teton Meet our ranger: Roy Wood is Katmai's chief of interpretation, education and partnerships. Originally from Evansville, Indiana, Wood committed to becoming a park ranger after a college internship at Grand Canyon National Park. He also worked as a seasonal park ranger at Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Everglades national parks.
Wood came to Katmai National Park and Preserve 10 years ago and fell in love with the brown bears.
"I got to the point where I could recognize the bears," says Wood, producer of "Katmai: Alaska's Wild Peninsula," which will debut July 5 on PBS. "They ceased to be anonymous, wild animals in the forest. They became individuals with behaviors and identities. It's been really fun to see bears that I saw as cubs come back with their own cubs."
For a day trip, don't miss: Brooks Camp. The park service operates a visitor's center there from June 1 through September 17, and the area offers fishing, anthropological history and world-class bear watching. Overnight visitors can purchase a camping permit or stay at Brooks Lodge.
Katmai is home to more than 2,100 protected brown bears. Wood says that during July, 70 to 100 brown bears are concentrated within a square mile of Brooks Camp. The bears can be observed from the trail or from stands that provide increased protection.
"We don't put radio callers or ear tags on the bears," Wood says. "There is nothing to ruin your photos."
Travelers to Brooks Camp should come prepared, as the NPS website advises travelers to bring proper gear for rugged terrain and unpredictable weather, which often results in travel delays.
Summer in the Park: Yosemite
Favorite less-traveled spot: Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. While noting that most of the park is "less traveled," Wood suggests visitors to Brooks Camp take the 23-mile daily bus ride to the valley. Created by the Novarupta volcano's 1912 eruption, it was the sight that so awed explorer Robert Griggs. Wood recommends visitors spend a night camping there.
"You have the volcanoes, the valley and beautiful uncluttered sky," he says. "That intense solitude is available to just about everyone."
Favorite spot to view wildlife: When Brooks Camp is slow for bear watching, Wood says experienced outdoor explorers should check out any place on the Pacific coast where sedges, a grass-like plant that bears eat, grow above the high-tide line.
There are pilots who will take you to Geographic Harbor, Swikshak Lagoon and Hallo Bay for bear watching during the spring and summer, he says. The northern edge of Katmai is best for viewing wildlife in August and early September, says Wood, but that the local names don't exist on a map and are known only by pilots who fly there.
Summer in the Park: Cuyahoga
Most magical moment in the park: The first time Wood stood in a river to watch salmon run to their spawning grounds. "We often speak of salmon being the lifeblood of the region and its people," he says. "When you are waist deep among them, it is easy to see why. At first, the salmon deflect around you. But if you remain still, they gradually accept your presence and resume their normal upstream movement."
Funniest moment at the park: A dominant male bear reclaimed his favorite fishing spot from younger male by intimidating the young bear into falling over the waterfalls. "Bears can be unintentionally funny," says Wood. "Every now and then their comedic timing is impeccable."

Summer in the Park: Isle Royale A ranger's request: Katmai is home to brown bears, which are the same species as grizzly bears but have different behavior patterns, says Wood. Keep at least a 50-yard distance from all bears, which are solitary animals.
You should never separate a mother from her cub, says Wood. The mother will interpret the separation as a threat. Since brown bears can move at speeds up 35 miles per hour, escape will be practically impossible.
"A common misconception about Katmai and Brooks Camp is that since they (the bears) don't run, they're tame or they like us," says Wood.

Another park he loves: Canyonlands National Park in Moab, Utah. Wood says he would like to return to the Colorado River Plateau, the region where his long trek to becoming a park ranger began. Canyonlands is on the plateau and is a series of geographical forms created the by ancients flows of Colorado River and its tributaries, Canyonlands is home to Horseshoe Canyon's, rock art, Island in the Sky mesa and the Cedar Mesa Sandstone spires at Needles.

Slain American teacher in Libya devoted to his faith By Ashley Fantz, CNN
updated 7:05 PM EST, Fri December 6, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Ronnie Smith was a deacon in his church in Austin, Texas He moved to Libya a year and a half ago and taught chemistry at International School Benghazi
Gunmen killed the 33-year-old as he jogged outside his home in Benghazi
(CNN) -- Ronnie Smith believed in three things: teaching, Libya and Jesus Christ.
The 33-year-old educator from Austin, Texas, was gunned down Thursday as he went on a morning jog outside his home in the Libyan city of Benghazi.
No one has claimed responsibility for the slaying. Libyan authorities have pledged to investigate the killing, the latest in a series of assassinations in some Libyan cities. There have been near-daily targeted killings in Benghazi and Derna, with the victims mainly security forces, activists and members of the judiciary.
Smith's death is a reminder of how dangerous eastern Libya has become, awash in weapons and armed groups since the 2011 ouster and street-mob killing of dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
American teacher killed in Libya
Smith moved to Libya a year and a half ago and took a job with the International School Benghazi, a new school on the outskirts of Benghazi where English was taught, according to its site. Hundreds of comments praising the teacher flooded the school's Facebook page within hours of his murder.
"You didn't have to know him to know what he was about -- which was respect, optimism, cooperation, team work," posted Noor Hewaidi. "He believed in his students, and that's the greatest gift any teacher can grant a child."
Some grieved for his wife, Anita, and their young son who Smith often wrote about on his Twitter account.
The teacher recently tweeted: "It's official. I miss my family."
According to members of Smith's church back home in Austin where he served as a deacon, the teacher chose to stay in Libya while his wife and son returned to the States, because he wanted to support his students through midterm exams.
Shortly after Smith's slaying, the Austin Stone Community Church removed from its website a video that shows Smith talking about his "need to spread a spiritual message," according to CBS News.
"I want to go where no one could find a church if they wanted to, where no one has access to this gospel," Smith said of his impending trip to Libya.
The church sent only parts of that video to CNN.
In one part, Smith says, "If there's any single person in the entire universe that you can take a chance on, it's God."
Another clip provided to CNN shows Smith lovingly looking at his wife, with the sun setting in the background, as he proclaims his strong belief that God will be with him in heaven. "That can never be taken away from me no matter what happens," he says. "I'm good. That gives me peace. I'm OK with that."
On Smith's personal page on the Austin Stone Community Church's site, he wrote about his devotion to Christ.
"I was raised in the church from the time I was an infant. It was only by the grace of God that I went through my high school and college years free from the major struggles that many of those I knew dealt with. It was not always sunshine and lollipops but God's hand was always leading me and He brought me to where I am today."
If the chemistry teacher could spend an evening with anyone who lived in the past 1,000 years, he wrote he would choose Jonathan Edwards, a Christian theologian who died in 1758.
Edwards "understood that God gave us minds for the soul purpose of glorifying Him. All of his writings and personal letters are saturated with Christ and he always seemed to have the glory of God in the forefront of his thinking. As a man of supreme intellect and prestige, he was refreshingly humble and holy. If I could model my life after anyone in the last 1000 years it would definitely be Edwards," the teacher posted.
"Ronnie's greatest desire was for peace and prosperity in Libya and for the people of Libya to have the joy of knowing God through Christ," Dave Barrett, executive pastor of Austin Stone Community Church, wrote on the church's site.
Could Smith's openness about his beliefs have made him a target?
Proselytizing has long been illegal in Libya. Since the 2011 revolution there has been a real phobia spreading among certain circles that Christians and Shiites are doing missionary work in the country, particularly in the eastern part of the country.
Earlier this year, dozens of Egyptians were accused of proselytizing and were rounded up in Benghazi. According to some reports, Islamist militiamen tortured them. Pictures released at the time showed piles of Bibles and Christian children's coloring books.
In the spring, the European Union Delegation in Tripoli said it was worried about the detention and treatment of people held on alleged charges of proselytism in the country. In March Coptic Christians in Benghazi had their church ransacked and set on fire.
Before this attack, Egyptian Copts attacked the Libyan embassy in Cairo, burned the Libyan flag and erected a cross over the entrance, according to Foreign Policy. Around this time, Egyptian Christian Ezzat Atallah, arrested on charges of proselytizing, died while being held in Libya. He was reportedly tortured.
CNN requested to speak with Barrett, who declined to answer questions and referred CNN to church spokesman Paul Lee.
Lee said that Smith was not working as a missionary for the church in Libya but that the church does have missionary programs. Lee declined to say where in the world those missionary programs operate.
Apart from being a country where religious expression could result in arrest or worse, Libya has been a particularly dangerous place for Westerners.
On September 11, 2012, militants attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, killing four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens.
Several Facebook posts on the international school's site about Smith allude to the ambassador.
Mahmoud Agni wrote: "I wish to God that justice take its way & I hope that God does not waste his blood like Chris Stevens."
"I understand hatred for what the US government does," Brian Kav posted. "This man was not the US government. He wanted to help kids learn."
Another post refers to Abu Anas al Libi, an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
U.S. special forces captured al Libi in Tripoli in October. He has pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges brought against him in federal court in New York.
"This is exactly what I said a few weeks ago after the stupid US foreign policy advisers OKed kidnapping the wrong guy from Libya," someone posted on the school Facebook page. "You think his family will just stand still and wait for mercy? No. They will go around shooting random Americans or kidnapping them for revenge. This administration killed this teacher by their stupid acts. You kidnapped the Libyan guy and you don't even have a case against him and you just have him in a jail in NYC waiting for nothing. and you know you cannot bring a case against him because you have no case..."
A leading Libyan terrorism analyst told CNN that he believes Smith was killed by groups linked or sympathetic to al Qaeda.
"You need to analyze the target," said Noman Benotman, a senior analyst at the Quilliam Foundation. "It was most likely he was targeted because of his nationality, and the groups most interested in doing that are al Qaeda and local Jihadists allied with them in Benghazi."
Benotman pointed to a 17-minute Arabic language video released last week in which American al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn called for al Qaeda supporters in Libya to avenge al Libi's capture.
"I say to the people of Libya in particular and the sons of the Ummah in general: Do not leave this criminal cowardly act to pass without punishment," Gadahn stated, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence group.
Three days after al Libi's arrest, the American teacher expressed his opinion about Islamist hardliners.
Smith tweeted: "Libyan Islamists are threatening kidnappings. As if they can fit kidnapping in to their 2 hr work day that already includes a nap. Losers."
