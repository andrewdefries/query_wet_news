POTTUVIL, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Till Mayer is a journalist working for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Galle, Sri Lanka. He is writing about his experiences as part of the relief effort for CNN.com.Part 1: Sunday, January 2Part 2: Monday, January 10Part 3: Tuesday, January 25Tuesday, January 25The crane is straining. The massive fishing boat swings in the air hanging meters above on steel ropes, between golden beach and blue sky.The tsunami waves tossed heavy wooden vessels ashore on December 26 like paper boats. Now they lie scattered over the whole beach, stranded between palms.Many of them are only wrecks. Broken wood, where rocks shattered the heavy planks. Maybe one day some of the boats can sail again. The crane starts with the clearing up.I return to the car and continue the journey south towards Galle. To the left and right are remnants of the disaster. Sometimes all that remains are heaps of stones, reminding me of the fishing huts that stood there one month ago. The rubble passes me by.But there is not only destruction to see. Everywhere along the coasts of Sri Lanka people are still clearing up and sometimes even beginning to rebuild. Fires burn beside the roads: mattresses, splintered timber and broken furniture transformed into ash. From the debris the tsunami victims collect what is useful for reconstruction: roofing tiles, stones and corrugated sheet. Neighbors help each other.And the aid workers of the Red Cross lend a hand. At the next stop the sun already beats down from the sky. Sweat runs down of the faces of 25 Red Cross volunteers from Bentota. "Straight after the tsunami disaster I joined the Red Cross. Now I clear up the rubble with my friends", says a 23-year old.In the background a wrecked house rises up into the sky. The tidal wave shattered the timber roofs like matches, tearing away furniture, windows, doors, everything.Red Cross workers, many young, push squeaking wheelbarrows along the affected coastline.They provide first aid, clean salted wells, distribute humanitarian goods or transport clean drinking water.The disaster has tapped into the humanitarian spirit and the number of Red Cross volunteers has increased, a fact Vpali Sirimanne is proud of.Sirimanne is the honorary Red Cross chairman of the district of Bentota. He used to work as a full-time diving instructor. Before the tsunami he ran his own equipment and boat rental business. The wave destroyed everything.Not far away a Red Cross truck stands next to the road delivering water. The pump is roaring, filling up a black plastic tank. The village inhabitants line up with cans and buckets. Clean drinking water is essential to avoid the outbreak of diseases and epidemics.I think of my German Red Cross friends in Pottuvil. They prepare 120,000 liters of drinking water daily, supplying camps for the homeless. Then there are the two basic health care centers run by the Finnish and French Red Cross societies.The tsunami has brought me back in touch with colleagues from other missions. Dieter Mathes is the German Red Cross ERU team leader, an aid-worker with decades of experience, and Konrad Kerpa, whom I met last year in Bam.Then an enormous earthquake had transformed the entire Iranian city within seconds into a sea of rubble. Both disasters happened on December 26.The city of Pottuvil looms -- a particularly sad chapter in my Sri Lanka mission. The former paradise for surfers is now only a field of rubble. Thousands died here. I will never forget the sight of numerous corpses floating in the water. It was terrible.The bridge between the city center and the former tourist area was destroyed. The German Red Cross water team managed to get water over the destroyed bridge using a 728-meter hose.The German Red Cross is also operating a field hospital in the north of the country and is one of several National Societies working in close cooperation with the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Sri Lanka Red Cross.My journey continues. The road is hopelessly overcrowded. A railway track runs parallel to the road. Or rather, what remains of it. The waves bent the rails like play dough. Nearby an iron rail hangs over a palm trunk.I come to the town of Tellwatte. The place looks like it a bomb site. What's left of the train station stands amid the rubble. Walls have been partly washed away. Villagers set up a Buddha statue on a broken roof, lost between the remains.Behind the station a reddish-brown train appears. Over 1,400 people died when the wave hit the wagons, tearing the carriages apart. Heavy equipment has set the death train again on its track.The bodies of the dead have been recovered, but still there are sad reminders. In front of the wagon lies a small doll, its legs ripped off. Its painted eyes staring into the sky. The girl, who played with the doll, is dead. The tsunami disaster claimed nearly 40,000 lives in Sri Lanka. An incomprehensible number.Red Cross and Red Crescent planes and ships have brought tons of goods to the vulnerable. The first new houses are appearing while others are being reconstructed."The acute emergency phase is over, reconstruction can start", says Axel Pawolek, the FACT team leader with the Federation.One month after, it is still hard for me to comprehend the extent of the disaster. If it is difficult for me as a visitor to this country, imagine how hard it is for the innocent, bewildered victims such as the children. In a few minutes the world as they knew it, was washed away. Beloved ones will never return again.There are wounds you cannot see, and they will take a long time to heal. That is a further challenge for the Red Cross/Red Crescent.Monday, January 10 The clean-up operation has begun in Pottuvil.POTTUVIL, Sri Lanka -- The advertising sign is lost in amid the rubble. On it is written "Tsunami Hotel" in big letters, and a giant wave is breaking over it.A favorite place to stay for surfers from all over the world -- until December 26.Now the sign rises up in the sky like a monument. In a cruel irony, the tsunami has taken the hotel named after it.Mohammed Ali passes by the remnants with slow steps. The disaster has made an old man out of the 52-year-old. The wave washed away his house like a sand castle, his brother-in-law will never return with his boat from fishing.Heavy bruises cover the body of the fisherman. Every breath hurts. Deep inside there is a stronger pain. It will stay for a long time. Mohammed Ali knows it too well.Along both sides of the road there are long rows of destroyed houses. Not long ago they were guest houses, small pubs and shops. Pottuvil was well known as a paradise for holiday makers. For Mohammed Ali that now seems a lifetime away."Sometimes I do not know what I should believe. That this sea of rubble is reality? Or that I am just dreaming? When I wake up, will I see again the bustling city with all the tourists and the owners of the restaurants, who are buying my fresh fish", he says softly.The leg of a plastic doll juts out of the rubbish that was swept up by the tsunami. Next to it lies a baby bottle. On a wall nearby a painting depicts a surfer riding a wave.Mohammed tries to walk faster. He tries to avoid thinking about something which he is unable to find an explanation for.A young man waves from a roof of a destroyed house. "Is everything okay with you?" he asks.Mohammed Ali nods and the man continues to throw down the roof tiles that are still unbroken to another man who catches them cheerfully.In Pottuvil like everywhere else alongside the coast of Sri Lanka people start to clean up, sometimes even to rebuild.Marie Mauret, a psychologist with the French Red Cross basic health care unit in Pottuvil has been impressed with the coping mechanisms of the local community."People are really brave here. And there are so many volunteers to help us. Despite the sorrow everybody is working hard to cope with these terrible times. People are proactive. They do not wait until someone comes to help them, she says.The Red Cross has erected a basic health care post in a hotel. Plastic sheeting covers holes in walls damaged by the tsunami.Mohammed Ali takes a seat on a rickety chair. Like so many others he is waiting patiently to get treated. Word of the Red Cross health post is being spread by word of mouth. An island of safety in the sea of rubble.The Red Cross mobile medical team has also been established to cover scattered temporary shelters south of Pottuvil to provide services to patients who would find it difficult to get to the center.The psychological impact on the community is something that Mauret says cannot be stressed enough."Many of them are deeply traumatized. It is especially hard for children to understand what happened", she says.Children are finding it difficult to sleep and their rest is blighted by nightmares. They react by crying after the unbelievable things that happened to them and their families, like the girl who is being treated by a doctor at the center. The Red Cross-worker smiles at the girl, speaking calming words.Where the town of Pottuvil ends, a green paradise stretches as far as the eye can see. In the sunlight lush green rice fields are shining. Between them palms and huge trees grow.A road winds through the landscape and next to it are a couple of big blue water tanks. Here the German Red Cross emergency response unit is purifying up to 120,000 liters of drinking water a day for more than 15,000 affected people."Without our friends from the Sri Lanka Red Cross we would have had great trouble becoming operational. With a group of young Red Cross members we have been able to install everything fast. It is a good feeling to work in a strong team together with our local colleagues and friends", says Dieter Matthes, the experienced German Red Cross-team leader.Then he trudges through the mud to the water pump. Heavy rain is affecting the region. Many centers for displaced people are situated around the water-purification unit. Some of the fisher families who escaped from the beach found shelter here and receive water from the unit.A few kilometers away there are the big white tents of the basic health care center established by the Finnish Red Cross. The unit also makes home visits and together with the center, providing vital health services to affected communities."In addition to delivering basic health care, we are promoting hygiene and health education which is vitally important for people who have lost everything", says Red Cross doctor Ilkka Mikkonen.Sunday January 2, 2005 GALLE, Sri Lanka -- The waves are beating on gray stones, hiding the rubble in the sand. Between broken bricks and mud sticks a silver-colored lady's shoe. Behind it lies a piece of bent metal.M.K. Ahula kicks a scratched teapot with his toe. Then he pushes his bicycle over the devastated area between the beach and the road, passing the remnants of a wall and a broken palm tree. This is all that is left of his house.The wave washed everything away on December 26, together with seven members of his family, among them two babies, his mother and his eldest son.It is hard to recover from such a disaster. Ahula gives the sea a quick glance. "I hate it," the 34-year-old fisherman says softly.He used to enjoy sailing in his boat, far out into the sea until the beach was only a tiny small yellow strip with the palm trees as a gray background. At night, he would see the lights of his hometown, Galle, reflected in the water. Now, the sea has taken his boat and nets. If he still had his wooden craft, he would sell it for sure.Ahula pushes his pedals. The rainy season has created large puddles in the bumpy street. Water splashes all around. But Ahula does not care about it. To his left and right, the street looks as if it has been bombarded.The flood took anything that was not attached to the ground with concrete, flushing the rubble through the narrow alleys with terrible violence. Broken wooden beams and bent steel roofs are all that remain of the fishing huts along the coast.In the center of the city. the old Portuguese fortress rises up against the sea. On the green lawn in front of it, people are gathering around a small lorry. They keep handkerchiefs against their noses and faces. When the breeze stops, the smell is unbearable.Ahula stands against his bike. The four dead bodies are so heavenly swollen that relatives hardly recognize them. Today he will not find out anything about his three missing relatives.The Buddhist Mahagoda temple is at a safe distance from the devastating sea. It seems like an idyllic picture for a postcard: Old walls surrounded by lush greenery. High trees protect against sun and rain. In the shadow stands an old Minor Morris.The temple offers no clues that the city was struck by the tsunami. At first sight. nothing reminds of the death toll -- believed to be 140,000 -- among them about 30,000 in Sri Lanka alone.But the harmony of the temple is misleading. Between its walls, 100 people left bereft of everything by the tsunami are looking for shelter.A mini van rolls through the temple gate, carrying a team of young Red Cross volunteers. The pebbles crunch under their feet. Like so many other volunteers, these youngsters -- aged 18 and 25 -- are on the road providing first aid treatment. There are 2,500 volunteers on duty, cleaning wells, distributing goods and searching for the missing.They also try to dispense some hope, to people like L.P. Seteen. The 72-year-old carpenter clutches his umbrella. There is no handle anymore. But it was the only thing he could get a hold on when he was running out of his house.He describes in a soft voice to Red Cross leader Nandana Wickamanyake how he was able to save his own life."Thanks to God nobody of my family got killed. I am so thankful for this," says the old man to the volunteer.Meanwhile, some Red Cross volunteers put on bandages and disinfect wounds. Many of the homeless were injured when they escaped the wave.Wickamanyake is proud of his group. "We have been on duty for days. Everybody is contributing all their energy. We must set an example. Now is the time for everyone to start cleaning up and rebuilding," explains the 35-year-old.Gradually, all traces of the destruction in Galle will disappear. In the lush green hills close to the city, the heavy sound of traffic roars among the palms and trees. Heavy Caterpillar machines are digging mass graves.About 4,000 people have perished in the district of Galle. The last mass graves have already been filled up. Close by, Buddhist monks pray for the victims.But the grief is touchable and will remain for a long time, long after the damage from the tsunami has been repaired.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Man dies after cop hits him with Taser 9 timesStory Highlights Suspect died after police officer Tasered him nine times; investigation launched Coroner rules death homicide, says man might've been dead after seventh shock Family outraged it has taken months for any action: "The family wants justice" Prosecutor is expected to decide soon whether to file charges Next Article in Crime » Read VIDEO INTERACTIVE From Drew Griffin and David Fitzpatrick CNN WINNFIELD, Louisiana (CNN) -- A police officer shocked a handcuffed Baron "Scooter" Pikes nine times with a Taser after arresting him on a cocaine charge. Baron Pikes, 21, was Tasered nine times by a police officer in January in Winnfield, Louisiana. He stopped twitching after seven, according to a coroner's report. Soon afterward, Pikes was dead. Now the officer, since fired, could end up facing criminal charges in Pikes' January death after medical examiners ruled it a homicide. Dr. Randolph Williams, the Winn Parish coroner, told CNN the 21-year-old sawmill worker was jolted so many times by the 50,000-volt Taser that he might have been dead before the last two shocks were delivered. Williams ruled Pikes' death a homicide in June after extensive study. Winn Parish District Attorney Christopher Nevils said he will decide on any charges against the ex-officer, Scott Nugent, once a Louisiana State Police report on the case is complete. Watch coroner describe how cop might've Tasered a dead man » "It's taken several months for this case to even be properly addressed, so one has to wonder, why did it take so long?" said Carol Powell Lexing, a lawyer for the Pikes family. "Obviously, a wrongful death occurred." Nugent's lawyer, Phillip Terrell, said his client followed proper procedure to subdue a man who outweighed him by 100 pounds. But Williams said Pikes was already handcuffed and on the ground when first hit with the Taser, after the 247-pound suspect was slow to follow police orders to get up. Winnfield, a sleepy lumber town about 100 miles southeast of Shreveport, Louisiana, is best known as the birthplace of legendary Louisiana governors Huey and Earl Long. It's also about 45 miles northwest of Jena, Louisiana, where a racially charged assault case sparked a September 2007 demonstration by an estimated 15,000 people.

Nugent is white; Pikes was black. His death led to demonstrations that drew several dozen people in Winnfield, where the population of about 15,000 is roughly half African-American. "The family wants justice," Lexing said. "This is just another example of why it's very important to stay vigilant with these types of cases, on the injustice that's been perpetrated on the disadvantaged." But Winnfield police Lt. Chuck Curry said race "isn't an issue at all" in the matter. "This has come down to a police officer that was trying to apprehend a suspect that they had warrants for," he said. "He done what he thought he was trained to do to bring that subject into custody. At some point, something happened with his body that caused him to go into cardiac arrest or whatever." See how Tasers work » According to police, Pikes was wanted on a charge of possession of cocaine when police tried to arrest him outside a shopping center January 12. "He would not stop for the officer," Curry said. "At some point in there, he was Tased to bring him under control, and several hours later, died at the emergency room." Terrell said Pikes was fighting Nugent "on uneven ground" amid obstructions such as concrete blocks and barbed wire. "He's fighting, wrestling with an individual who weighs 100 pounds more than him," he said. "His partner had just come back to the police department from triple bypass surgery and could not assist Officer Nugent." Terrell said his client "used every means possible" to take Pikes into custody before pulling out his Taser, a weapon Winnfield police purchased in 2007. "The only thing he could have done other than to say, 'OK, we're going to let you go' is to beat him or Tase him. He did the right thing," Terrell said. Williams, who ruled Pikes' death a homicide in June after extensive study, said Nugent fired his Taser at Pikes six times in less than three minutes -- shots recorded by a computer chip in the weapon's handle. Then officers put Pikes in the back of a cruiser and drove him to their police station -- where Nugent fired a seventh shot, directly against Pikes' chest. Don't Miss Accused, arrested, Tasered

"After he was given that drive stun to the chest, he was pulled out of the car onto the concrete, " Williams told CNN. "He was electroshocked two more times, which two officers noted that he had no neuromuscular response to those last two 50,000-volt electroshocks." Williams said he had two nationally known forensic pathologists, including former New York city medical examiner Michael Baden, review the case before issuing his conclusions. He said it's possible Nugent was shocking a dead man the last two times he pulled the trigger. "This fellow was talking in the back seat of the car prior to shot number seven," he said. "From that point on, it becomes questionable [if Pikes was still alive]." Curry said Pikes told officers he suffered from asthma and had been using PCP and crack cocaine. But Williams said he found no sign of drug use in the autopsy, and no record of asthma in Pikes' medical history. In the year since Winnfield police received Tasers, officers have used them 14 times, according to police records -- with 12 of the instances involving black suspects. Ten of the 14 incidents involved Nugent, who has no public disciplinary record. Nugent was suspended after Pikes' death, and Winnfield's City Council voted 3-2 to fire him in May. He is appealing his dismissal, and his lawyer says he followed proper procedures in Pikes' case. He was trained in the use of the Taser by a senior police officer who was present during the incident that led to Pikes' death, Terrell said. Curry said Taser International, the device's manufacturer, indicates that "multiple Tasings do not affect a person." But he said he could not explain why Pikes was shocked so many times, and said whether Nugent followed proper procedure was "yet to be determined." But a copy of the Winnfield Police Department's Taser training manual, obtained by CNN, says the device "shall only be deployed in circumstances where it is deemed reasonably necessary to control a dangerous or violent subject." And Williams said regulations regarding the use of Tasers were not followed. "It violated every aspect -- every single aspect -- of the department's policy about its use," the coroner said. Winnfield has seen a spate of high-profile corruption cases in recent years. One of Nevils' predecessors as district attorney, Terry Reeves, killed himself amid allegations of embezzlement and extortion. The town's current police chief, Johnny Ray Carpenter, is a convicted drug offender who received a pardon from former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards who himself is now serving a federal prison term for racketeering. And Carpenter's predecessor, Gleason Nugent -- the father of Pikes' arresting officer -- committed suicide in 2005, after allegations of fraud and vote buying in the race for police chief, an elected position in Winnfield. Now Nevils is awaiting the state police report on Pikes' death, which will be presented to a grand jury for possible charges against Nugent -- a possibility Curry said would be a blow to the department. "It's one of these no-win situations," he said. "No matter the outcome, nobody's going to win in this case."

Obama: Troops alone cannot win in AfghanistanStory Highlights President Obama: Diplomacy will play a bigger role in Afghanistan in future Obama's promise comes after announcement of U.S. troop increase U.S. is sending up to 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan, Pentagon says Obama also promises more development to win AfghanistanNext Article in Politics » Read VIDEO EXPLAINER WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Diplomacy will play a bigger role in U.S. efforts in Afghanistan in future even as the Pentagon announced a significant troop increase, President Barack Obama said Tuesday in an interview on Canadian television. President Obama says al Qaeda threatens American from the Afghan-Pakistani border. "I am absolutely convinced that you cannot solve the problem of Afghanistan, the Taliban, the spread of extremism in that region solely through military means," Obama told journalist Peter Mansbridge as part of a wide-ranging interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. "We're going to have to use diplomacy. We're going to have to use development." The Pentagon said Tuesday that Obama had approved a significant troop increase for Afghanistan, which is expected to include 8,000 Marines and 4,000 Army troops. An additional 5,000 troops will be deployed at a later date to support combat forces, bringing the total to 17,000, the Defense Department said later in the day. Canada has about 2,800 troops in Afghanistan, but parliament has voted to pull them out by 2011. Obama suggested he will take up the issue with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper when the two meet Thursday in Ottawa. "My hope is that in conversations that I have with Prime Minister Harper, that he and I end up seeing the importance of a comprehensive strategy, and one that ultimately the people of Canada can support, as well as the people of the United States can support," Obama said. The White House is reviewing America's strategy in Afghanistan, according to the president, who said the situation "appears to be deteriorating." iReport.com: Do youths have "war fatigue"?

A "Buy American" provision requires the use of U.S.-produced iron, steel and other manufactured goods in public works projects funded by the $787 billion package. Obama said Canadians shouldn't be too worried about the provision. "My administration is committed to making sure that even as we take steps to strengthen the U.S. economy, that we are doing so in a way that actually over time will enhance the ability of trading partners, like Canada, to work within our boundaries," he said.

John McCain, Obama said he believes in fair trade, but added, "NAFTA did not have enforceable labor agreements. ... We should make them enforceable." iReport.com: "Afghanistan: The real war on terror" Environmental and labor protections are side agreements to NAFTA. "My argument has always been that we might as well incorporate them into the full agreement so that they're fully enforceable," Obama said in the CBC interview.

Conservatives rally against health care billFrom Paul Courson, CNN STORY HIGHLIGHTSRallies come before expected House vote on $875 billion measure House Democrats still plan to make revisions to billNorth Carolina man closes his business for the day to attend rallyHe says he protested "economic terrorism going on in Washington" Washington (CNN) -- Conservative activists tried to put the brakes on health care reform Tuesday, holding rallies on Capitol Hill intended to sway wavering Democrats days before a final expected House of Representatives vote on a sweeping $875 billion measure. The plan, which would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than 40 years ago, passed the Senate in December. If it clears the House, it will go to President Obama's desk to be signed into law. Although Democrats still plan to make revisions to the bill, final passage of the landmark measure would be a huge victory for the president. It would also mark a major legislative defeat for Republicans and their allies in the conservative movement. "If [the] bill can't pass the House, scrap the bill, start over," Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana, told demonstrators from a range of conservative organizations, including the Tea Party Express, Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks. Video: Tea Partiers: 'Kill the bill'

U.S. House of Representatives
Christina Latchford of Florida said she opposes the individual coverage mandates in the bill, as well as the methods being used by Democrats to push it through Congress. "The way they're trying to put it through is unconstitutional," she said. "One house is not approving it, and the other is trying to pass it. [That's] my understanding." Latchford was referring to a strategy being considered by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that would allow House Democrats to avoid a direct vote on the Senate bill. The speaker may call for a vote on a rule that would simply "deem" the Senate bill passed. The House then would proceed to a separate vote on changes that would make the legislation more acceptable to House Democrats. "That goes totally against the Constitution," Latchford said. Both chambers must pass individual bills before they can be signed into law, she said. Luis Padilla, a Virginian who is originally from Latin America, said he turned out for the rally because for the "10 years that I've been in this country, I've been making my own decisions -- the doctor, the dentist ... and I want to keep it that way." Padilla said he believes that the bill would take his medical choices away while providing a handout he doesn't want. "I don't expect the government to pay for me," he said. "If I come to this country expecting the government to take care of my family, to take away my responsibility, it takes away the incentive for me to prosper, the incentive for me to get a better job. "I want to do it myself," he said. James Bond said he temporarily closed his cleaning business in Wilmington, North Carolina, to attend the rally. He said he wants to "protest against the economic terrorism going on in Washington with the passage of this bill." "I'm very concerned with the price tag associated with it," he said. "I would really love to see things worked out where we do have insurance reform but at a reasonable price." Bond's 7-year-old daughter, Taylor, was riding on her father's shoulders dressed as the Statue of Liberty. She cheerfully shouted the word "liberty" as people gathered for the demonstration at a park across from the U.S. Capitol. Jim Fernander of Douglas Hill, Georgia, says he doesn't like the bill. "I don't want the same people that run the post office running my health care." Informal estimates put the number of protesters between 500 and 1,000.CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this story.

Rio's slum faces challenges after police pacification
By Shasta Darlington, CNN
updated 6:39 AM EST, Tue November 15, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A door-to-door search follows a raid to take control of a Brazilian favela, or shantytown
"It's 100% better. It's better than normal," a food vendor says
Rio de Janeiro is trying to crack down on crime before the 2014 World Cup
Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Rio de Janeiro's special forces moved quickly and didn't stop to chat Monday as they peered in windows and knocked on doors in Rocinha, the city's biggest shantytown.
In a predawn raid the day before, 3,000 troops seized control of the hilltop favela, wresting from the hands of drug traffickers. They declared victory in just two hours, without firing a single shot.
"Today a lot of the drug dealers are gone," said Luis Machado, one of the officers in charge of the door-to-door searches. "Others are hidden. And it's now that we're going to find them and the weapons."
The massive operation was part of efforts secure Rio de Janeiro and eliminate bloody drug gangs ahead of the 2014 World Cup and the Olympic Games two years later.
For many of Rocinha's 100,000 residents, it was business as usual on Monday.
Food stalls displayed strings of garlic and onions while motorcycle taxis zipped up and down the winding roads.
"Thank god it's over," said Giovani, a food vendor. "It's 100% better. It's better than normal."
Police raid notorious Rio shantytown
Rio police storm city's largest slum
Rocinha's top drug trafficker, Antonio Francisco Bomfim, known as Nem, was captured by police last week, days before the invasion.
According to residents, a three-story house overlooking the shantytown and beachside condominiums below had been his home until his arrest.
Inside, all appliances and even bathroom fixtures had been ripped out, but the signs of luxury are evident, including a small pool and private gym. An empty bottle of Black Label whiskey sits on the glass bar.
Still, in many ways, the hard work has only just begun.
Mountains of trash line the streets, and tangled masses of electrical wires dangle over houses.
"Before this was called a favela because it was full of criminals," said Juliete, an 18-year-old physical trainer. "Now things have to be done to call it a neighborhood. We need running water, proper sewage and things for young people to do."
Raimundo Cesario, who has lived in Rocinha for 40 years, agreed.
"The system trapped young people in a life of crime. But it's also true that they helped people when they needed it," he said. "We'll have to see if things are better or worse under the police."

Move over iPhone: In China, it's cool to call on 'Xiaomi'
By Kristie Lu Stout, CNN
updated 10:08 AM EDT, Tue October 2, 2012 | STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Analyst: China is set to surpass the U.S. this year as the top smartphone market
Three of the top five selling smartphone brands are local Chinese makers
Lenovo, Coolpad and Huawei smartphones all outsell Apple's iPhone in China
Xiaomi brand smartphone has become a cult favorite among Chinese tech geeks
Editor's note: A self-described media junkie, China nerd and geek mom -- Kristie Lu Stout is also an anchor/correspondent for CNN International. Join her on News Stream, each weekday at 8pm Hong Kong time, 1pm London, 8am New York.
Hong Kong (CNN) -- He's the 20-something blogger who created the iconic Steve Jobs action figure.
He's also the Hong Kong-based gadget fan who worked his supplier contacts in China to leak authentic components of the latest iPad before the official launch.
And yet, despite his devotion to all things Apple, MIC Gadget's Chris Chang says if it came down to just one device -- he would choose a Chinese-branded smartphone over the iPhone.
"I like spending less money to get a similar performance from the iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy series," says Chang. "The China-branded smartphone is my choice."
Evolution of the mobile phone
Open Mic: Is cell phone dependency bad?
Hong Kong: We love our smartphones
London: Mobile phone gave me street cred
Chang shows me his preferred smartphone -- the roughly $400 OPPO Finder. The Android-powered phone is just 6.65 millimeters thin -- thinner than the iPhone 5. That said, it's not a 4G handset.
But it's enough for Chang and a growing number of discerning Chinese smartphone users.
China is forecast to overtake the U.S. in smartphone shipments and become the world's leading smartphone market this year, according to research group IDC.
Break it down by marketshare and, according to IHS iSuppli Research, in the first half of 2012, three of the top five smartphones sold in China are local Chinese brands: Lenovo, Coolpad and Huawei. All three individually outsell Apple's iPhone in China.
The mainland China smartphone market has been partly fueled by the demand for lower-cost handsets. In China, a 16GB iPhone 4S sells for RMB4,488 ($712). Traditionally, Huawei and Coolpad have been selling to the lower-end of the market, below RMB1000 ($160).
But China's Meizu, Xiaomi and OPPO are climbing up the value chain -- not so high as to angle for the top tier of the market with Apple and Samsung, but right in the middle.
"Meizu, OPPO and Xiaomi are poised to differentiate themselves as strong mid-range smartphones, like a sedan," says Josh Ong, China Editor of The Next Web. "At RMB 1,999 ($317), the (Xiaomi) Mi-Two will be 'good enough' for millions of consumers who aren't willing to spring for the more expensive devices."
Meizu was formerly the coveted smartphone brand in China, but that mantle has passed on to Xiaomi which -- like Apple -- masterfully markets its technology like a lifestyle.
Xiaomi is the smartphone cult hero in China with its intensely loyal fans who adore the company's charismatic founder, Lei Jun, and the brand's distinctive style.
How China's mobile market breaks down
How China's mobile market breaks down
Bottom line -- in China today, it's cool to have a Xiaomi phone.
"Watching a thousand Xiaomi fans give Lei and the new phone a standing ovation last month really drove home the company's success at connecting with its customers," says Ong.
So how can the rest of the world get their hands on a cult Chinese smartphone?
Well, you can't. They're only available in China. Xiaomi may have an English language Twitter feed, but it didn't want to lend its Mi-Two phone for review to international audiences on CNN's News Stream. (We had to borrow the phone from Chris Chang.)
Meizu has an English language Website, but there's no option provided to buy the phone. There is, however, a retail store outside the mainland... in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.
The fan base for China's sleekest smartphones will remain in China for now.

Why China won't turn the other cheek over foreign policy
By Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, Special to CNN
updated 3:54 AM EST, Thu November 15, 2012
A man shouts anti-Japanese slogans during a protest against Japan's 'nationalizing' of disputed islands, September 19, 2012.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
China appears to toughen its foreign policy to match its economic might
Beijing uses perceived provocations to assert itself
Examples of conflicts with Japan, Philippines, Vietnam
Editor's note: Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt is China Adviser and Northeast Asia project director for the International Crisis Group. She is based in Beijing.
Beijing (CNN) -- China's change of leadership that began last week comes as domestic pressure mounts for the world's second largest economy to toughen its foreign policy to match its economic might.
Yet Beijing is keen to prevent the world from concluding that China has discarded the notion of a peaceful rise. The result has been reactive assertiveness; a foreign policy tactic perfected during China's ongoing maritime disputes. This approach allows Beijing to use perceived provocations as a chance to change the status-quo in its favor -- all the while insisting the other party started the trouble. Those expecting China to turn the other cheek are mistaken.
Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt of the International Crisis Group
The prolonged stand-off with Japan over the sovereignty of a few islets offers a vivid example of this approach. In September, the Japanese government announced that it was finalizing the purchase from their private owner of the disputed islands -- called Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China -- in the East China Sea. But Beijing interpreted the move as a betrayal of the two countries' agreement to shelve their quarrel, and saw the timing as a deliberate attempt to disrupt the leadership transition and foment instability at a vulnerable moment.

China responded decisively, with what state media called "combination punches." These measures ranged from the verbal -- leader-to-be Xi Jinping labeling Japan's purchase of the islands a "farce" -- to economic retaliation and large-scale anti-Japan protests and naval exercises in the East China Sea.
But the real game-changer in the stand-off came when Beijing declared its territorial baselines around the islands; a move that legally places them under Chinese administration. Once the announcement was made, China began to regularly dispatch law enforcement vessels to patrol waters off the disputed islands, directly challenging Japan's de facto control of the area for the past 40 years. Such is the new normal, claim Chinese officials.
CNN
In recent weeks, Chinese media have been trumpeting the efforts of Chinese ships to expel Japanese Coast Guard boats. Reminding the world that the troubles were all started by Tokyo, China claims that the burden is entirely on Japan to find a way out of the mess.

Similar heavy-handed action was used against the Philippines in a spat over the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea in April. When Manila maladroitly responded to a fishing run-in by sending a warship, China took the opportunity to strengthen its claim over the disputed shoal by deploying law enforcement vessels to the area, extending its annual unilateral fishing ban to cover the waters around the shoal; quarantining tropical fruit imports from the Philippines and suspending tourism; and roping off the mouth of the lagoon to prevent other fishermen from entering.
By maintaining regular law enforcement patrols and preventing Filipino fishermen from entering those waters, China has managed to establish a new status-quo in its favor.
In recent months, a territorial dispute over a set of islands in the East China Sea has strained Chinese relations with Japan. The dispute flared when Japan announced it had bought the islands from private owners. Protests swept through China as citizens expressed their anger at Japan's island purchase.

A similar blueprint was then used in June in response to a maritime law passed by Vietnam with new navigation regulations covering the disputed Spratly and Paracel Islands. Before the ink on the law had dried, China upgraded the administrative status of Sansha city encompassing a group of disputed islands in the South China Sea and established a military garrison.
Furthermore, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) offered oil exploration leases in nine blocks located within Vietnam's Exclusive Economic Zone, which overlap with blocks offered by PetroVietnam.
A key component of Beijing's counter-punches are the use of economic punishments, including suspending imports, halting tourism, encouraging boycotts, offering up oil blocks in disputed areas, or impeding fishing access.
Disputed islands in East China Sea
In contrast to a time when foreign policy was designed to serve economic growth, China is now increasingly using its economic might to advance political ends -- even when this hurts China itself. According to one Chinese analyst, "These measures will hurt China. But they hurt Japan more".

For its part, Japan says that it purchased the islands to prevent the hardline Tokyo mayor from acquiring them and carrying out a plan to build there. It also wanted to avoid "punching the new Chinese leadership in the face" just after the transition.
Now, analysts in Beijing claim that a Pandora's Box has been opened and there is no going back to the tacit agreement that has kept peace in the East China Sea for decades.
Read more: Why China's reforms have hit a brick wall
Right now, Beijing is primarily preoccupied with maintaining the momentum of economic development and preventing domestic troubles from erupting into potentially destabilizing unrest. The new leaders will not want to look weak, thus blunting the edge of their "reactively assertive" foreign policy.
If there is any perceived slight, no matter how minor, expect China to pounce.

How to bridge fiscal cliff
By Edward D. Kleinbard, Special to CNN updated 11:40 AM EST, Fri November 30, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Edward Kleinbard: America's fiscal policy faces an apparent Hobson's choice Kleinbard: But the dilemma of fiscal cliff is more apparent than real He advocates a three-year transition from current policies to a more sustainable mix
Kleinbard: We can do it without being sure what the new taxing and spending rules will be
Editor's note: Edward D. Kleinbard is a professor at Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California. He is the former chief of staff of Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation.
(CNN) -- America's fiscal policy faces an apparent Hobson's choice. On the one hand, we need to tame federal deficit spending by imposing new across-the-board spending cuts and higher taxes. We are told that if we do not act on this soon, the debt markets will choke on the overabundance of government debt issued to fund those deficits, causing interest rates to climb. As a result, businesses and homeowners will be unable to borrow on reasonable terms, which will lead to a slowdown of the economy.
On the other hand, we also are told that allowing this deficit reduction program actually to take effect in 2013 would precipitate a new recession.
Edward D. Kleinbard
Faced with two genuinely unpalatable courses of action, it's no wonder that Washington struggles to find a consensus.
But, the dilemma is more apparent than real, because it confounds the dimension of time.

What we need to do is to commit today to a transition -- a ramp -- from our current taxing and spending policies to a more sustainable mix. A firm congressional commitment, for example, to a three-year ramp, by means of which we move to a sensible combination of higher taxes and lower spending, should enable the economy to heal while reassuring markets that the long-term fiscal health of the country will be restored.
Of course, advocating a three-year transition from where we are to where we need to be is the easy part. The real challenge is to identify the new policies.
A bona fide "grand bargain" might need to encompass as much as $8 trillion in lower spending and higher taxes over 10 years to address fully the underlying fiscal trends, not the much smaller numbers currently bandied about. Figuring out how to do that will be extremely painful for Congress, because regardless of party affiliation, members like to give more than they like to take away.
Tax cuts and political reality
Barrasso discusses the fiscal cliff
Rep. Cole: Tactic strengthens position
The genuine difficulty of defining the new mix of taxing and spending policies that will apply at the end of the ramping-up period means that negotiations will take a great deal of time. But our dilemma reminds us that we do not have the luxury of time to thrash out all the components of this sustainable path, if we are to avoid an immediate recession.
We have to define the ramp to a new fiscal policy without being sure exactly what those new taxing and spending rules will be. This sounds impossible: How do you build an off ramp from a highway to connect to another road that does not exist and has not yet even been mapped?
There is a way to do just that. First, let all the Bush tax cuts and other temporary tax discounts expire (which is what legislative inaction will trigger on January 1), but phase in the expiration of the Bush tax cuts over three years (so that a third of the extra tax bite is added each year). At the same time, repeal the $1 trillion of new across-the-board spending cuts (the "sequestration") to which Congress committed itself when the budget "supercommittee" failed.
These two steps define the ramp. The repeal of the spending cuts adds to the deficit but is far outweighed over time by the incremental taxes that would be raised if all the Bush tax cuts expired.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that those higher tax revenues largely solve the deficit problem over the next 10 years or more. The resulting tax system can simultaneously be improved, for example by eliminating the hated Alternative Minimum Tax, without any further revenue costs through a few surgical strokes I have advocated before.
Then, let Congress do what it does best, which is to cut taxes starting three years from now -- but with a catch. The deal must be that Congress bind itself in advance automatically to apply new spending cuts (compared with the budget office's projections) to tax rate rollbacks. So, for every $1 billion reduction in government spending, Americans' tax bills automatically would be cut by $1 billion.
Those tax rate rollbacks should start with the lowest tax bracket first. The reason for this ordering is that all taxpayers, rich and poor alike, get the benefit of the lower tax brackets on their income in that bracket. By buying down tax rates from the bottom up, the proposal shares the savings from new government spending cuts across the broadest possible number of Americans.
Under this proposal, the ramp up to a sustainable budget would be set in advance (through the three-year staged repeal of all the Bush tax cuts), as would the way to lighten the load without deviating from the path's ultimate goal of fiscal sustainability (through spending cuts automatically applied to buying down those scheduled tax rate hikes).
Given this opportunity, both parties will have strong incentives to agree to spending cuts, because each net spending reduction will bring new tax relief to constituents. If Congress enacts large enough spending cuts, all the tax rate hikes would automatically roll back.
Over time, Congress will reach a balance between new taxes and reduced spending through negotiations that offer members a positive reward -- tax relief -- to counterbalance the bitter pill of spending cuts. But the key is that those scalebacks in government spending programs do not have to be identified before this Christmas; as each is enacted in the months or even years to come, the automatic mechanism would deliver tax rate rollbacks to Americans.

(CNN) -- You would click on the link, and there you'd find the Tea Party Patriots' mailer, calling for liberty and asking for money, decrying "big-government Republicans" and "leftist Obama Democrats" alike.
But the real target of this particular pitch was none other than Karl Rove himself, the "architect" of George W. Bush's two White House wins, accused in the ad of trying to "crush the Tea Party movement."
And he was depicted as a Nazi.
John Avlon
Photoshopped into the uniformed visage of vicious SS commandant Heinrich Himmler, no less -- the architect of the Holocaust.
It's hard to imagine a more offensive piece of political e-mail.
Not surprisingly, within hours, the e-mail was retracted and apologies offered all around. It was a terrible case of mistaken identity, an inexplicable bit of human error, the Tea Party Patriots said through a high-priced PR agent when called by Politico's Ken Vogel, who broke the story. The Virginia-based political fundraising firm, Active Engagement, promptly fell on its sword, which is the decent thing to do when you've been paid $1.5 million and screw up this definitively.
The tea party's impulse to attack Rove personally -- so deeply felt that putting an SS uniform on him seemed like a good idea to somebody in the chain of command -- is a sign of just how bitter this GOP civil war is becoming.
Rove's alleged sin is the formation of a group dedicated to nominating electable congressional candidates for the GOP. It seems that some folks in "the establishment" don't like losing Senate races every year because the partisan primary system keeps kicking up extreme candidates who are beloved by the hyperpartisan base but can't win in a general election.

Cases in point: Senate candidates Sharron Angle, Ken Buck and Christine ("I am not a witch") O'Donnell in 2010; the no-abortion-even-in-cases-of-rape duo Richard Mourdock and Todd Aiken in 2012. If those five tea party favorites hadn't imploded in spectacular fashion, Republicans could be in control of the Senate right now.
So Rove & Co. are backing more centrist Republican candidates who they think have a chance.
Borger: Obama can't kick his legacy down the road
The midterms are 18 months away, but the fault lines are already forming. Two states -- Georgia and Iowa -- appear primed to put forward the next Angle and Aiken in the form of two right-wing congressmen: Paul Broun and Steve King.
GOP prevents Hagel Senate vote
Obama, GOP clash on forced spending cuts
Rep. King: Healing today, work tomorrow
It turns out that Broun has a bit of a Nazi-calling problem himself. Days after Barack Obama's first election in 2008, Broun was first out of the gate on this ugly front, comparing the president-elect to Hitler.
In his apology, Broun tortuously explained that "I'm just trying to bring attention to the fact that we may -- may not, I hope not -- but we may have a problem with that type of philosophy of radical socialism or Marxism." In recent years, Broun has become best known for proclaiming evolution and the big-bang theory "lies from the pit of hell" and asserting his belief that the Earth is 9,000 years old. Despite these and many other slips into the fringe, Broun was uncontested in his most recent election and serves on the House Science Committee. If he is the GOP nominee, Democrats could have a chance at winning the Georgia Senate seat for the first time since Max Cleland.
Likewise, Iowa congressman Steve King is the proud father of a steady stream of hyperpartisan howlers, beginning in the 2008 election, when he predicted that if Obama were elected, "The radical Islamists, the al Qaeda ... would be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11, because they would declare victory in this war on terror." When the McCain campaign sensibly disavowed his statements, King pushed back and said terrorists would view Obama as their "savior" and "That's why you will see them supporting him, encouraging him." Tell that to Osama bin Laden.
In recent years, King has been the lone "no" vote on a congressional resolution apologizing for the use of slaves in building the U.S. Capitol, supported deporting "anchor babies" and, yes, defended Akin's campaign comments by saying he hadn't heard of any young woman getting pregnant from rape or incest. You see pretty quickly where this campaign is likely to go in a swing state that voted for Obama twice.
LZ Granderson: Rubio missed the year of the woman
Nonetheless, Broun has thrown his hat in the ring, and polls show King a favorite among rank-and-file conservatives in Iowa. Hence Rove's group, getting ready to do some reverse RINO-hunting of its own with a spinoff of the Crossroads super PAC. It's called "The Conservative Victory Project."
I appreciate how tea party groups might howl when the outside money is directed against them, but a taste of your own medicine is sometimes morally clarifying.
In a larger sense, this family feud is fascinating for several reasons. It represents a realization by Rove -- the father of the "red state vs. blue state," "play to the base" strategy -- that there is such a thing as too extreme. Some of the forces that the Republican establishment encouraged when its self-righteous hate was directed against Obama have found that venom can be directed at them. In this same vein, House Speaker John Boehner has found that 50 or so tea party radicals are his biggest problem in governing; they are quick to undercut him and eager to gamble with the full faith and credit of the United State. Golem always turns on its creator.
In the end, the Republican Party does need to reform. It needs to rebuild the big tent and reach out beyond its base. It needs to stop coddling the angry and unhinged in its ranks. And it needs to become more philosophically consistent when it comes to advancing individual freedom as well as fiscal responsibility.
Count me with Karl Rove and Co. -- in at least this one case. The Tea Party Patriots' misfired e-mail was an ugly tell, a reminder that angry conservative populist passions can transform into a mob mentality. Extremes are always ultimately their own side's worst enemy.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Emirates Executive offers chartered flights on a luxury Airbus A319 Airline hopes to tap into a growing niche market, especially in emerging regions
Plane-maker Bombardier forecasts the private jet market will exceed pre-2008 levels by next year
(CNN) -- For those that love the luxury of first class air travel but loathe the imposition of having to share it with others, Emirates thinks it has the aircraft for you.
The Dubai-based airline is aiming for the high-end business traveler with a new luxury private jet service. Launched this week, Emirates Executive is a bijou and bespoke version of its premium product in a dedicated Airbus A319. It can be chartered by individuals, groups or corporations through the website. Qatar Airways and Korean Air are two commercial airlines that offer a similar executive jet chartering service.
"We have seen an increasing demand in the private travel segment, especially in the Middle East and Europe as well as in markets such as India, Russia and China," said Adnan Kazim, Emirates' Divisional Senior Vice President for Planning, Aeropolitical & Industry Affairs.
"We are looking to tap into this niche market with the high quality of service and attention to detail."

Private jets of the super rich
The Emirates Executive Airbus A319 can accommodate 19 people, with the plane divided into two main zones.
The front of the aircraft has a dining area and executive lounge designed to seat 12 people. Mechanically activated tables can be raised in front of two large sofas, while one of 1,500 channels of in-flight entertainment can be watched on two 42-inch LCD screens.
The rear of the aircraft has ten private suites -- similar to the ones found in Emirates' First Class cabins. Live TV, video conferencing facilities and high speed internet and mobile phone connectivity are also available on board.
Passengers with an appetite can have specially prepared meals served on board by Emirates crew, while a full-height shower with heated floor is available for those who need refreshment after all that exhausting pampering.
Google Street View explores the Airbus A380
While the world's super-rich may still be able afford their own private aircrafts, the chartering of executive jets is a growing market. It's certainly a more affordable option than buying a large private jet outright; an Airbus ACJ318 (similar to the Emirates Executive A319) or long-range Gulfstream G650 costs around $65 million from the respective manufacturers.
While it took a big hit after the global recession that began in 2008, the private jet market is on the rise. According to forecasts by Canadian private jet manufacturer Bombardier, the industry is expected to exceed pre-2008 levels for the delivery of new jets by next year.

North America, with around 40% of the market, remains the biggest destination for private executive travel but the largest growth is expected to come from emerging regions in Latin American and Asia. Although hampered by lack of airspace and facilities, in the coming years China is expected to see a 15% increase in number of private jets flying in its skies, according to Bombardier.
The sector is worth $626 billion to manufactures like Embraer, Bombardier and Gulfstream. Boeing and Airbus produce executive iterations of their planes, including the 747 and A380.
David Velupillai, marketing director of executive and private aviation for Airbus says that their jets -- from A318s to superjumbo A380s -- can be fitted out according to their clients' needs.
"We can do features which the Chinese market particularly appreciates, such as a large round table which is the focus of Asian life. We can do Karaoke bars," he said.

Car Tax Opposition Propels Gilmore's Candidacy
GOP candidate pulls ahead in Virginia governor's race By Charles Bierbauer/CNN
FALLS CHURCH, Va. (Oct. 31) -- Republican candidate Jim Gilmore has ridden one issue, Virginia's much-loathed car tax, to a lead in the race for governor. Gilmore, who campaigned at a Halloween parade on Wednesday night, has turned the property tax on cars into the scariest thing in the race.
Polls show his plan to cut the tax have propelled him ahead of his Democratic opponent, Don Beyer. One survey has Gilmore 13 points ahead.
Beyer's running behind, trying to show there's more trick than treat in Gilmore's proposal to cut Virginia's property tax on vehicles.
Each county sets its own rate. But the tax adds up to hundreds and even thousands of dollars depending on how fancy Virginians' cars are.
Republican Gilmore proposes ending the tax on cars valued up to $20,000. Democrat Beyer offers to offset the car tax with a credit up to $250 for families earning up to $75,000.
Beyer, a car dealer before he was elected lieutenant governor, is a late convert to any cut. He says Gilmore's plan is a "gimmick."
"The slogan from hell, 'No Car Tax,' doesn't tell you the truth," Beyer said. "It takes five full years to phase in, until 2003 ... "
Gilmore says he's been up front. "You phase it in, and you return the funds back to the counties, the cities dollar for dollar so there's no loss of revenue ... " Gilmore said.
Gilmore has made inroads against Beyer in usually Democratic and more affluent northern Virginia. So Beyer has struck back along the state's political divide, as competing ads playing in the more Republican Southwest show.
One Beyer ad warns of $600 million flowing to Northern Virginia. A Gilmore ad counters, " ... Every tax dollar you pay in Southwest Virginia will stay in Southwest Virginia ..." Beyer has sought to divert attention from Gilmore's tax plan.
Another of his ads says, "Pat Robertson, the polluters, big tobacco. They all want Jim Gilmore to be governor. Do you?" Gilmore dismissed that strategy. "Every year the Democrats try that same old scare tactics toward the end of the campaign," he said.
Beyer's got a potential problem with the African-American vote a Democrat needs, because former Gov. Doug Wilder has withheld his endorsement, though President Bill Clinton has pitched in to help.
The Virginia race is a chance for Democrats to regain a governor's seat. But Republican Gilmore seems to be in the driver's seat, mostly because he's discovered Virginians really get angry about the high cost of getting behind the wheel.
