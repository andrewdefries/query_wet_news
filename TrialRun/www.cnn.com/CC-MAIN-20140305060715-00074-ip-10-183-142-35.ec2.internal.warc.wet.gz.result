Ugly to compare tea party with terrorists By John Avlon, CNN contributor John Avlon STORY HIGHLIGHTSDemocrats frustrated with debt-ceiling deal equated the tea party with terroristsUgly comparison continues "cycle of incitement," says John Avlon Fear-monger fundraising deployed quickly in Michele Bachmann e-mail on incidentEditor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is the author of "Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America." (CNN) -- The cycle of incitement continued this week as Democrats frustrated with the debt-ceiling deal equated the tea party with terrorists, just weeks before the 10th anniversary of 9/11. It is an ugly and unacceptable comparison, especially coming -- as it did -- on the heels of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' triumphant return to Congress after being shot in Tucson in January. The instinct to raise funds off fear-mongering was also deployed in record time, as GOP presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann -- no stranger herself to the politics of incitement -- fired off an e-mail which read: "The Democrats have stooped to a new low. This afternoon, Vice President Joe Biden reportedly led a congressional meeting where tea party members were labeled as 'terrorists.' " Biden was falsely implicated in initial reports, and on CBS' Face the Nation, Biden said: "What happened was there were some people who said they felt like they were being held hostage by terrorists...I never said that they were terrorists or weren't terrorists, I just let them vent." He added: "I said even if that were the case, what's been happening when you now have taken and paid the debt and move that down so we can now discuss, the nuclear weapon's been taken out of anyone's hands." In the same time frame, newly minted New York Times columnist Joe Nocera fired off a piece, "The Tea Party's War on America," centered on the same theme. Among the more explicit imagery deployed was this: "The tea party Republicans can put aside their suicide vests." He apologized in a column Friday. Obama: Debt issue 'self-inflicted wound'

U.S. Congressional Politics
Talking about "hijacking" debates is an acceptable part of political discourse -- a vivid metaphor for a vocal minority taking control of the entire ship of state. Extending that to comparisons with terrorists -- who by definition kill innocent civilians -- is a bridge way too far. Conservatives were rightly upset at the relative lack of media outrage about these statements that might have been broadly denounced if they came from a sign at a conservative populist rally. In this case, it was fascinating to see the debate descend into screeds about terrorist tactics: "Trying to save the world as we know it today" (that was Pelosi) and "Satan sandwiches" (I have no idea what that is). After all, this was a policy debate over the debt; a fight over funding, albeit with default hanging in the balance. As James Piereson, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and author of a book on John F. Kennedy and American liberalism, told me: "The out-of-control rhetoric directed against the tea party is truly bizarre, especially given the fact that it was provoked by a complex budget debate that few Americans even understand, including those tossing about terms like 'terrorist' and 'jihad.' Temper tantrums and name-calling are rarely helpful in advancing understanding and good policy." He's right. But this hair-trigger cycle of characterizing political opponents as personal enemies and demonizing people who disagree with you has proliferated, as the two parties have become more ideologically polarized. Talking about the apocalyptic intentions of the other side has become part of the fundraising pitch and national political conversation, pumped up through partisan media. With that has come a pervasive tendency to excuse or ignore extreme statements that come from your side of the aisle. The rationalization seems to be "they may be crazy; but they're our crazies," offered with a wink and a nod. Michele Bachmann in particular has made the cycle of incitement a profitable sideline, playing politics by talk radio rules in which there is no such thing as too extreme. A standard-part of Bachmann's repertoire is warning of the president's determination to impose "tyranny" and "slavery" on the American people. This fear-mongering helped her to raise $13.5 million in national activist cash, while playing the victim card whenever she was called on her tactics. Both Michele Bachmann and DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz used the term "dictator" to describe their political opponents on the same day last week. The two gaffes were almost unremarkable in the current spin cycle -- part of the scenery. Terrorist comparisons have surfaced since the '08 campaign, when -- to use just one example -- Iowa Congressman Steve King declared, "If (Obama) is elected president, then the, the radical Islamists, the, the al Qaeda, and the radical Islamists and their supporters, will be dancing in the streets in greater numbers than they did on September 11." Sarah Palin's accusation during the '08 campaign that Barack Obama was "palling around with terrorists" referred to his acquaintance with Bill Ayers, but the implications were far broader. And when it comes to fear-mongering as policy re-framing, Palin's raising the specter of government "death panels" that would sentence your parents and children to execution remains a memorable low. But the conservative outrage over the recent "tea party = terrorists" rhetoric also seemed to be tinged with a satisfied sense of hypocrisy-hunting. After all, President Obama and the Democrats were the ones who called for a "new tone" after the shooting of Gabby Giffords, a call for civility that was much-mocked on right-wing talk radio at the time. For example, Rush Limbaugh, who after the Giffords shooting announced "Civility is the new censorship" now greeted news of the Democrats' comparison by asking semi-sarcastically "Where is the civility?" This is, of course, the man who calls President Obama 'imam child.' Behind the outrage seemed to be a sense of vindication of the view that this is the way politics is run in practice and aspirations toward civility are naïve at best -- that it's time to embrace gutterball as the new normal. So how will this cycle of incitement stop? It will only happen if responsible Republicans and Democrats start standing up to the extremes of their own party as a matter of principle. The godfather of the modern conservative movement, William F. Buckley Jr. famously stood up to the John Birch Society founder Robert Welch after he published a book alleging that President Eisenhower was a Soviet spy. He understood that extremists were ultimately their own side's worst enemy and that unhinged attacks reflected badly on the broader movement he was trying to build. But in our time, we rarely see such moments of courage rewarded. Instead, standing up to the extremes in one's own party usually is greeted with a talk of primary challenge and over-heated accusations of disloyalty. This is part of what happens with polarization -- the fringe starts to blur with the base. The impulse to play to the lowest common denominator and pander to special interests starts to crowd out considerations of the national interest. We need a reset in American politics -- and that will only happen when Democrats and Republicans are willing denounce extreme statements and professional polarizers on their side of the aisle. This is not evidence of moral equivalence. It is an attempt at moral clarity.

Barroso: Europe federation 'unavoidable'
By Richard Quest and Oliver Joy, CNN
updated 11:21 AM EDT, Mon October 1, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso says a federal Europe is "unavoidable" European institutions are already moving toward a more unified Europe in attempts to stem crisis
Barroso's call is the latest in a long line of measures taken by European politicians
According to Barroso, integration is the only way to compete on the global stage
Editor's note: Watch Quest Means Business on CNN International, 0600pm GMT and 0800pm CET weekdays. Presenter Richard Quest is CNN's foremost international business correspondent. Follow him on Twitter.
London (CNN) -- The European Commission's president Jose Manuel Barroso says a federation of Europe is "unavoidable" if Europe's embattled common currency is to survive the financial crisis.
Barroso's comments to CNN followed Wednesday's annual "State of the Union" address, which he delivered in Strasbourg, France, making the case for a unified Europe to stem the euro-area's debt crisis.
In reference to the euro, shared by 17-member states, Barroso told CNN: "A single currency depends on the solidity, on the credibility of the institutions and the political construct behind it. So, I believe [a federation] is going to happen.
"We are saying that in some areas, like the common currency, like the supervision of the banks, like the common supervision of the budgets, we need this sharing of sovereignty," he added.
Plans for EU banking union under way
European institutions are already moving toward a more unified Europe in attempts to drag the euro bloc out of its financial mire.
Are central banks doing enough?
The European Central Bank -- led by president Mario Draghi -- is undertaking a bond-buying program for fiscally-frail nations in an effort to reduce borrowing costs for the likes of Italy and Spain.
More: Crisis in-depth
On Wednesday, the European Commission -- the executive branch of the EU -- presented plans to extend the bank's powers further. Barroso wants to give the European Central Bank a regulatory role for over 6,000 banks operating in the eurozone.
This raised concerns, particularly by Germany, over sovereignty and banking supervision.
But Barroso told CNN: "citizens of Europe are now paying very, very heavy bills because precisely we don't have that, because the banks are transnational, but the supervision until now is purely national."
His comments follow this week's decision by Germany's Constitutional Court to green light the European Stability Mechanism -- the euro area's permanent bailout fund for debt-ridden nations -- that will come into force in October.
According to Barroso, "the European Stability Mechanism has a capital that is comparable to the International Monetary Fund, so it's the European IMF we have now."
Read: Eurozone now has time, but needs growth
"It's quite obvious that to sustain a common currency, we need more common power," he added.
Barroso's call for a federal Europe is the latest in a long line of measures taken by European politicians to forge closer financial ties. Moves include March's deal for a "fiscal pact" which will come into force January 2013, should it be ratified by 12 of the 17 euro countries.
But Barroso said such measures would not threaten the sovereignty of participating countries: "It's a shared sovereignty," he said. "It's not a transfer of powers from the capitals."
Read: Draghi's gamble
Barroso said he had "no doubts" about the determination of Greece -- at the center of the eurozone debt crisis -- to implement reform and retain its place in the common currency.
According to Barroso, integration is the only way to compete on the global stage. "Even the biggest countries in Europe alone, if they are on their own, they will not have the leverage to deal with these issues globally, with our American friends or with the giants of power, like China and others that are emerging," he said.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Many find it hard to disconnect, even when on holiday
Westin Dublin hotel lets users swap cell phones for "detox survival kit"
"Digital detox" next big thing, according to travel industry report
But many guests still prefer hotel wi-fi to ditching technology
Business Traveller is a monthly show about making the most of doing business on the road.
(CNN) -- With the advent of smartphones we've become used to being constantly connected, even when we're on the road or on vacation. But now a growing number of hotels are adding "digital detox" packages to their roster of offerings.
Detox packages are nothing new. For decades, hotels and vacation retreats have enticed guests to "clean out," often with the help of a specialized diet plan and fitness regimens (with a massage thrown in for good measure). These days, the concept is being pushed to help us disconnect from technology. The World Travel Market Global Trends Report even listed digital detox as one of the next big trends to hit the hospitality industry in the coming year.
The push has come on the heels of increasing reports of travelers' inability to "unplug." A recent Google survey found that in the United States, 80% of smartphone users almost never leave their home without their device, while a TripAdvisor survey found nearly half of mobile owners use their phone to augment their vacation (e.g. taking travel photos, researching restaurants, and so on).

We've witnessed the increased dependency people now have on their electronic devices.Andrew Henning, general manager, The Westin Dublin,
"We've witnessed the increased dependency people now have on their electronic devices," notes Andrew Henning, the general manager at The Westin Dublin, in Ireland.
In March, the hotel introduced a digital detox package to combat this gadget addiction (recently classified in the media as "nomophobia"). Guests that partake in the package stash their electronic devices in a safe, and in exchange get a detox survival kit, which includes a board game, a walking map, a tree-planting kit, and other reminders that life exists beyond the confines of an iPad.
Via Yoga, a company that hosts yoga retreats in Mexico and Costa Rica, feels so strongly about the need for its guests to unplug that it decided to offer a 15% discount as an incentive for anyone willing to give up their iPhone.
"In the last couple of years, people have started carrying their phones and tablets with them all the time," notes Suzie Cavassa, the company founder.
In-flight Wi-Fi finally takes off?
"Our customers were even using them at dinner, or when hanging out by the pool," she says. "They were so preoccupied that they were missing out on the experiences they were paying for."
For guests that take the detox option (about 15 per season), Cavassa will lock away their devices and give them an emergency number, so that if someone does really need to reach them, they're not completely out of touch.
The cost of hotel Wi-Fi
"If someone needs to get hold of you, they can. But you're not working or checking Facebook; you're just experiencing the moment, checking out the sunset, or having a great conversation with someone you just met."
Cavassa admits that it takes a few days for most guests to stop feeling antsy as a result of the separation from their devices. Physical activities, like surfing and yoga, help make the transition easier, she notes.
Surfing is the type of activity that forces you to be in the present. There's no way you're thinking about Facebook or what you have to do at work when a giant wave comes at you. Suzie Cavassa, founder, Via Yoga
"Surfing is the type of activity that forces you to be in the present," she says. "There's no way you're thinking about Facebook or what you have to do at work when a giant wave comes at you."
Via Yoga's detox package is popular, but other venues offering similar packages admit that while there's interest, they're not flooded with bookings.
The Hotel Monaco Chicago provides guests with a "black-out" option, whereby they surrender their gadgets to reception upon checking in.
"We were constantly hearing from guests how they loved that the Monaco was an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city," says Marco Scherer, the hotel's general manager. "We decided to allow our guests the option to experience the ultimate seclusion by voluntarily forfeiting all methods of electronic communication at check-in."
Though guests are intrigued by the package, Scherer says very few actually opt to give up their devices.
"Most guests prefer our free wi-fi," he admits.

Henning says the same is true at the Westin. While guests from as far afield as Belgium, France, Poland and South Korea have called and expressed interest in the package, none have yet booked it.
He says: "We have found that guests are intrigued by the idea of detoxing from their electronic devices, but are not quite willing to make the commitment to a full digital detox."

Obama and Rubio: How did they do?
updated 1:48 PM EST, Wed February 13, 2013
(CNN) -- CNN asked for views on President Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night, which was dominated by domestic issues such as the economy and need to reinvigorate the middle class, gun control, minimum wage, early education and immigration. Afterward, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida delivered the Republican response. Sutter: A night that offered no hope for the jobless
John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion. He heads the section's Change the List project, which focuses on human rights and social justice.
After Barack Obama's speech and Marco Rubio's rebuttal, we should have heard from Kim Peters.
The 47-year-old single mother, who has been more or less unemployed since the start of the Great Recession, wore fuzzy Shrek slippers as she watched the president's State of the Union address Tuesday night from the middle of an empty living room south of Atlanta.
If the country and the president could have peered back at her through her small TV, they would have seen the piles of black trash bags, full of clothes, in the corners of the room. They haven't been unpacked since she was evicted from her last apartment. They would have seen the worry in her eyes -- felt the panic that wakes her up at 3 a.m. and makes her wonder how long it will be before she and her 7-year-old daughter end up homeless. Full story
Granderson: Rubio must have missed the year of the woman
LZ Granderson, who writes a weekly column for CNN.com, is a senior writer and columnist for ESPN the Magazine and ESPN.com
You would think that in the shadow of a general election dubbed "Year of the Woman," the last thing any Republican in Washington would want to do is tick off women.
And while the Violence Against Women Act passed in the Senate by a healthy bipartisan majority a few hours before President Obama's State of the Union address, the fact that 22 senators -- all Republicans, all men -- voted against it should be troubling to GOP leaders.
And perhaps the most troubling aspect of that is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the so-called savior of the Republican Party, was one of those Republican men.
Just think: A few hours before Rubio was to deliver a message reflecting a new Republican Party, he casts a vote that screams more of the same. Full story
Welch: Obama's 'do-something' plan for 'have-nothing' government
Matt Welch is editor-in-chief of Reason and co-author of "The Declaration of Independents: How Libertarian Politics Can Fix What's Wrong With America." The two most memorable lines of President Barack Obama's fourth State of the Union address were the ad-libbed: "Get it done" (which doesn't appear in the remarks as prepared), and the emotional "They deserve a vote," concerning victims of gun violence.
As exasperated appeals for an obstructionist Congress to get off its duff, the exhortations provided emotional catnip for Democrats. For the rest of us, however, they were sobering reminders of what governing liberalism has deteriorated into: content-free calls to take action for action's sake.
Consumers of national governance are within their rights to ask just what we've gotten in return for ballooning the cost of the stuff since 2000. The answer may lie in not just what the president said, but what he has assumed we've already forgotten. Full story
Rothkopf: Obama's message: I'm in charge
David Rothkopf is CEO and editor-at-large of the FP Group, publishers of Foreign Policy magazine, and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
It is sometimes said of a great actor that he could hold an audience spellbound while reading a laundry list. This is essentially what President Obama tried to do on Tuesday night. As State of the Union addresses go, his was artless. It lacked inspired phrases or compelling narrative. Save for the energy he gave it at key moments, it was pedestrian.
It was also very important.
It was important because with it, Obama returned in earnest to the work of governing. Having won a clear victory in November, and having spent the intervening months putting out the wildfires our Congress likes to set, he delivered word Tuesday night that he had a clear and full agenda for his second term. Full story
Navarrette: A kinder, gentler, wiser Marco Rubio
Ruben Navarrette is a CNN contributor and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group.
Sen. Marco Rubio was ready for his close-up, and he got it. Now you know what all the fuss is about.
Rubio, a rising star and possible 2016 GOP presidential hopeful, was picked to deliver the official Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union sddress.
The selection tells you a lot about what the Republican Party has in store for Rubio, and what this 41-year-old son of Cuban immigrants can do for a party that needs to become more user-friendly for Latinos. His remarks were also delivered in Spanish. Full story
Slaughter: Obama dares Congress to get the job done
Anne-Marie Slaughter is a former director of policy planning in the U.S. State Department and a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University.
The hallmark of the 2013 State of the Union address was progressive pragmatism.
Time and again, President Obama punctuated his proposals with the refrain: "We should be able to get that done." After his call for "bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit," he said: "We can get this done," and later, "That's what we can do together."
When he proposed the addition of three more urban manufacturing hubs and asked Congress "to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America," he added: "We can get that done." Full story
Coleman: Where was the foreign policy?
Isobel Coleman is the author of "Paradise Beneath Her Feet" and a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
President Obama's State of the Union address predictably focused on his domestic priorities.
Immigration reform, a laundry list of economic initiatives including infrastructure improvements (Fix it First), clean energy, some manufacturing innovation, a bit of educational reform and the rhetorical high point of his speech -- gun control.
As in years past, foreign policy made up only about 15% of the speech, but even within that usual limited attention, Tuesday night's address pointed to few new directions.
On Afghanistan -- America's longest war -- Obama expressed just a continued commitment to bringing the troops home, ending "our war" while theirs continues. On Iran, there was a single sentence reiterating the need for a diplomatic solution, which makes me think that a big diplomatic push is not likely. Full story
Greene: In 2013, democracy talks back about State of the Union
CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose 25 books include "Late Edition: A Love Story" and "Duty: A Father, His Son, and the Man Who Won the War."
"To report the state of the union." Within the first few seconds of President Barack Obama's address Tuesday night, he quoted the late President John F. Kennedy, who 51 years ago used those words to describe a president's annual duty.
As Obama spoke, citizens around the country were tapping away at keyboards, posting and sending messages -- public and private -- characterizing their own view of how the union, and its president, are faring.
Obama told the packed House of Representatives chamber: "We can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger." And those citizens around the country, typing away, were in essence saying: We'll be the ones to decide that, thank you very much. Full story

Sarah Palin follows the Donald Trump method
By James C. Moore, Special to CNN
updated 8:46 AM EDT, Tue October 29, 2013
Sarah Palin speaks at the National Rifle Association Leadership Forum in Houston in May.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
James Moore: Sarah Palin's revival on the tea party stage increases her brand recognition
Moore: She's a marketing machine, taking every opportunity to raise her profile Moore: Palin promotes tea party candidates in safe districts, never runs for office
He says her re-emergence comes just before release of her book defending Christmas
Editor's note: James C. Moore is a business consultant and partner at Big Bend Strategies, a business messaging firm. He is co-author of "Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W. Bush Presidential" and a TV political analyst. (CNN) -- Sarah is selling Sarah. The former vice presidential candidate and half-term governor of Alaska is a commodity of one and a marketing machine. She has created a new politics of profit.
Palin's reanimation on the tea party stage probably means no more than the other intentions she has floated but never executed. She spent almost a year of the last presidential election cycle teasing the far right that she was going to run for president. She never did, but lots of network TV interviews and speculative articles drove up her name recognition and brand identification.
And she's not running again.
James C. Moore
Palin is re-running the same show in her home state of Alaska by hinting that she is going to be a candidate for the U.S. Senate. She will not run though. There is too much risk of failure. She's not the near-unknown who was elected governor of Alaska and then quit 2½ years into the job. She has a profile, and she intends to use it to make money, which is one commitment she knows how to keep. Running and losing is always bad for business.
Palin is a product. Not a candidate.
Politically, Sarah Palin is an opposite gender version of Donald Trump. She makes grandiloquent statements about candidacies and a future that she knows will never transpire. Trump and Palin lack the courage to run for president but have profitably monetized the speculation about a candidacy. Trump cannot abide the notion of losing, which he knows is inevitable, and he fears what that might do to his image and revenue stream. Palin is self-aware enough to realize that she has neither the intellect nor popular support outside the increasingly unpopular tea party.
So why not make a buck?
In the detritus of the McCain-Palin presidential campaign, the second name emerged as the lead act. The first nine months after her resignation as governor, at the end of July 2009, Palin reportedly earned $12 million, including a book deal, a TV show and speaking fees that were generally more than $100,000 per appearance.
It's not hard to tell whether principle is more important than profit for the failed vice presidential candidate. The tea party has been charged $100,000 for a Palin speech, and, even as she promotes support of charities, a Toronto cancer center a few years ago paid $200,000 for her to attend a fund-raiser, and the event sold out at $200 a seat. Her politics and intelligence might be trifling, but Palin appears to have evolved a very nice business model: Raise the profile to raise the revenue, mostly for herself.
And she's back at it.
Until recently, Palin hasn't been too active, except on social media. She seems to have the entire national tea party population on her Facebook page, but the TV cameras had not been showing up when she gave her bargain-priced speeches. A love spat with Fox News that kept her off the air and then back into the network's arms has left her fans confused. Donations to Sarah PAC fell off. Why was no one paying attention?
Palinians should not fear. She has seen opportunity in the tea party and its plans to beat moderate Republicans in GOP primaries. This is a nearly risk-free approach to increased Sarah-wareness.
The candidate runs, Palin speaks and rallies the initiates. She endorses, and if the campaign fails it is the candidate's fault, not Palin's; she's moved on to help in another race. But the cameras came, reporters took notes, images were broadcast, words were published, and Palin's price went up.
Timing is critical to maximizing opportunity, of course. When the federal government shut down as a consequence of tea party obstinacy, Palin jetted off to Washington to help her ideological consort, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, as they crashed the "Barrycades" at the National World War II Memorial.
Those cameras and bullhorns and journalists were there. Palin had just arrived from New Jersey, where she had endorsed the hopeless tea party candidacy of Steve Lonegan, who lost, soundly, but not without Sarah getting TV time in New York.
In business school, they teach "know your customer." Palin might have attended that class because she is promising to help tea party candidates unseat GOP U.S. senators in South Carolina, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee in 2014. The Sarah Promoting Sarah tour begins, however, several months ahead at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Foundation dinner on November 9.
In what is almost certainly a coincidence of timing, just three days later, Palin's new book goes on sale for the holidays. She has not written about the Constitution or her understanding of Paul Revere in the Revolutionary War; Palin, instead, is doing the much more challenging work of preventing further harm to Christmas. "Good Tidings and Great Joy: Protecting the Heart of Christmas," can already be pre-ordered. Get yours now. Or just send a check to Palin. She might not understand politics or policy, but Palin knows money.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
CNN rode high over Atlanta this week with Goodyear blimp pilot Matt Lussier
The helium-filled airship flies "slow and low" at about 2,000 feet
Takeoffs and landings are a different experience in the blimp
(CNN) -- It's New Year's Eve, and we're suspended 2,000 feet above Atlanta by an iconic bag of gas. It's kind of hard to believe I'm actually flying the Goodyear blimp.
For a guy with zero piloting experience, I have to ask: Is this legal?
"Yep," Goodyear pilot Matt Lussier says, sitting on my right. "I'm a certified instructor, and you're my student."
Let me set the scene. High above the downtown Georgia Dome, where the Chick-fil-A Bowl is being played, Lussier, camera operator Tom O'Keefe and I are sitting in a tiny metal gondola with a passenger and cockpit area about 6 feet wide and 15 feet long. We're surrounded by windows, some of which are open.
This football season, Goodyear's three blimps are set to hover over eight college football bowls, including Atlanta's Chick-fil-A Bowl, Florida's Orange Bowl, California's Rose Bowl, Arizona's Fiesta Bowl, Louisiana's Sugar Bowl and the National Championship on January 6 in Pasadena, California. Goodyear began operating its own blimps in 1919. Now, an estimated 60 million Americans get a first-hand look at the company's airships every year. Dazzling computer-controlled signage called Eaglevision is visible up to a mile away, according to Goodyear.
The blimps fly at a maximum of about 53 mph but typically cruise at around 35 mph. Spirit of Innovation Capt. Matt Lussier says he likes moving "slow and low" because it allows him to appreciate the view. "When I fly over the beach, I can see sea turtles and sting rays and manatees. It's cool. It really is."
When landing a blimp, Lussier says, "you point the nose of the aircraft down and use power to get to the airfield." Then ground crew members grab the blimp's rope lines and tether the airship to a mast.
In 2013, Budweiser used a 130-foot-long American Blimp model A -60 Plus to promote its designated driver campaign. MetLife has been touring sporting events with its A-60 Plus model blimps since 1987. Its fleet includes "Snoopy One," Snoopy Two" and "Snoopy J."

Photos: America's airships
Big blimpin' over Atlanta
Can a high-tech blimp find Bigfoot?
Army's new souped-up blimp makes debut
Cancer patient's blimp dream
Looking out those windows ... it's a loooooooong way down.
And winds out of the northwest at about 12 mph are making it a little chilly.
We have to wear headphones to communicate with each other above the roar of the blimp's twin propeller engines. I don't mind telling you, it's more than a little unnerving.
As Lussier put it more than once this night: "That's blimpin'!"
In front of me on the floor are two pedals.
"Put your feet on the pedals, and push the right pedal down about four inches," Lussier says. When I do this, the rubbery 192-foot-long aircraft slowly begins to turn right. "Now, push the right pedal all the way to the floor." As I do that, I'm surprised when the left pedal starts to push up against the sole of my left foot.
Now, the blimp's right turn begins to speed up.
Next, Lussier tells me to floor the other pedal -- the one under my left foot.
Slowly, the lumbering airship reverses itself, bringing us back to a straight course.
A wooden "elevator wheel" to the right of the pilot's seat is used to point the airship up or down. No fancy "fly-by-wire" electronics here. It blows my mind to think that the controls at my feet are directly connected by cables to the rudder and elevators on the blimp's tail.
My five minutes as a blimp pilot trainee hammered home this fact: These aircraft are the ships of the skies. They perform a lot like ships or even submarines, Lussier says. The wind is the equivalent of ocean currents.
The 32-year-old Lussier, who's been "blimpin' " for Goodyear since 2011, answered some of CNN readers' blimp questions. I'll tick a few off:
• Nope, no bathrooms aboard. It takes discipline.
• No parachutes, either. The blimp flies too low for them to be effective safety equipment.
• No seat belts. No oh s**t handles like you might find in an SUV.
• The blimp does have Sirius/XM satellite radio, when the signal isn't blocked by the giant helium bag.
• Via radio, an ESPN TV director orders specific beauty shots for the bowl broadcasts from Lussier and O'Keefe. Those images are beamed via microwave to a truck on the ground. Although we can't watch the ESPN broadcast, we can see O'Keefe's video on a cockpit monitor.
• The blimp has the same cockpit indicators you'd expect on a plane, including altitude, speed and direction.
• The blimp has radar to track nearby aircraft.
• Rules call for the blimp to stay 1,000 feet above any obstacles, including skyscrapers, and 2,000 feet away horizontally.
Goodyear blimp: Surprising facts I also got a heart-pounding first-hand look at what makes blimp takeoffs and landings so challenging.
But first, some of you wanted to know why an experienced airplane pilot like Lussier, who's been flying since his teen years in North Carolina, would shift his career from flying private corporate planes to a whole other kettle of fish: blimps.
The answer: Lussier loves working with people. As a pilot, he wanted more than a job that flew passengers from point A to point B.
Flying for Goodyear -- and showing off what's arguably the world's most iconic blimp -- means he and the other blimp crews help raise hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for groups such as the Boys and Girls Club and the United Way. Hour-long blimp rides are auctioned off at fundraisers, and the money goes to help the needy.
Lussier seems to have been born to fly. When he was 3, Lussier's mother asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. "I told her I wanted to be a bird. So I guess I found the next best thing: flying."
He competed against about 1,600 other applicants to join Goodyear's blimp team, surviving a half-dozen interviews before he got the gig.
"I don't want to fly anything else ever again," Lussier says. "It's absolutely my dream job."
Blimpin' is all about appreciating the joy of flying "slow and low," as Lussier puts it -- sometimes so slow and so low that it's not unheard-of to be passed by flocks of Canada geese.
While we regular travelers enjoy the comfort of being sealed away from the forces of nature in airline cabins, blimpin' puts Lussier closer to the true experience of flight. He loves to fly with the windows open. In hot weather, he'll often lean out the window at 2,000 feet to cool off.
Helium heads
Many of the blimp's controls and flight procedures are the same as airplanes. But airship aficionados, affectionately known as helium heads, know what really sets these machines apart: helium.
The helium inside the blimp's giant gas bag, known as "the envelope," is lighter than air. It makes the blimp always want to rise, even when you're trying to land.
"They're homesick angels," says Lussier.
Airplanes take flight when wind rushes across and under their wings, pushing them into the air. With blimps, the lift of the helium creates a pulling sensation, as if a puppeteer is in control from above.
These homesick angels also have a devilish side: The helium and the wind can make takeoffs and landings very tricky.
For some reason, I thought the takeoff would be more like a balloon ride, gently rising from the ground to our eventual altitude. The reality is a bit more dramatic.
I'm not overstating it when I say this: Taking off in the blimp is a scary, thrilling, white-knuckle ride. On this night, Lussier performed one of blimpin's more difficult maneuvers: a "pull off."
Blimps take off best by heading directly into the wind. But that's not always possible. A "pull off" is a trick that pilots use when obstacles stand in the way. In this case, the obstacles are a ditch and a huge mast that is used to tether the blimp.
Using the rudder pedals, Lussier "threads the needle" between the two, steering the blimp like a boat crossing a river with a strong current.
Next, using engine control levers with his left hand and the elevator wheel in his right hand, Lussier points the blimp's nose upward and guns the power.
The blimp's two engines throttle up to a deafening roar as they push their propellers 2,800 revolutions per minute. Suddenly, I'm nearly on my back as Lussier points the blimp up at a 25-degree angle -- only 5 degrees short of maximum.
Heeeeeeeere we go.
The airship ascends at 1,500 to 2,000 feet per minute. In no time at all, we're 1,000 feet high and beginning to level off.
Here come the Zeppelins
At the stroke of midnight, hours after our rumbling takeoff, we find ourselves looking down at the city's traditional giant "peach" drop. This might well be the most unusual New Year's transition I'll ever see.
2014 also will be unique for Goodyear.
Zeppelin: Latest way to see Paris
It plans to begin phasing out the GZ-20A blimps -- like I'm riding in -- and replacing them with high-tech Goodyear NTs. These sleek, new bad boys are co-produced by the maker of the famous Zeppelin airships of the early 20th century. Goodyear NTs will have internal frameworks, unlike blimps, which will allow the fleet to go faster and maneuver better than ever before.
Eventually, Goodyear's current fleet of three iconic blimps will retire -- perhaps, some speculate, to become museum exhibits.
Of course, the usefulness of airships extends way beyond broadcasting and promotional purposes.
A U.S.-based company called Aeros is developing a new kind of airship that would carry cargo long distances over the Arctic. The defense industry has also been working on an airship that would carry heavy military equipment and be able to land or takeoff from virtually any terrain. The Pentagon tested a surveillance blimp in 2012.
Dirigible resurgence?
Those airship applications are taking off, but after more than six hours aboard the Spirit of Innovation, I'm ready to experience a blimp landing.
Atlanta's brightly lit skyline is dotted with spectacular orange, red and green fireworks shooting into the air far below as we motor toward DeKalb-Peachtree Airport.
Obviously, planes rely on gravity to bring them down to Earth. With blimps, not so much, because the helium makes them want to keep going up. "You drive it down; you don't fly it down," Lussier explains.
A weather event called a temperature inversion is going to make this landing a little more challenging. This happens when warmer air traps cooler air near the ground. The cooler air will cause a blimp to lift when it approaches a landing strip.
The runway looms large in our windshield, about 100 feet under the gondola.
To cut the blimp's tendency to lift, Lussier comes down low to let the chilly air near the ground cool his helium. Then we circle back around for a landing attempt.
"We'd better try to stay above airport property," Lussier says. We'd very much like to avoid any surprise New Year's Eve fireworks from the neighbors. Should I be nervous?
Armed with red flashlights, a 15-member Goodyear ground crew lines up along the airstrip and grabs the rope lines hanging from our blimp.
Lussier aborts our first landing attempt, a common occurrence. Circling back, we try again.
As the wheel under the gondola hits the pavement, you hear a comforting shushhhhhhhh as Lussier reverses engines to slow us down.
This unforgettable ride is done. All in all, we've burned about 62 gallons of "100 Low-Lead" airplane fuel.
The next day, the crew will pack up its five-vehicle convoy and follow the Spirit of Innovation as it flies toward Florida for another college bowl. There, they plan to do it all over again, practicing a century-old profession unique among aviators.
Like Lussier says: That's blimpin'!
