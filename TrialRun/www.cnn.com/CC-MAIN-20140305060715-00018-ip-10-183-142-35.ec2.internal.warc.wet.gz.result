Palin arrives in Haiti with humanitarian delegation By the CNN Wire Staff Sarah Palin visits with children after her arrival Saturday in Haiti. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Sarah Palin has landed in Haiti, a Graham spokesman saysShe is traveling with Franklin Graham, the head of Samaritan's PurseShe has not commented publicly on the tripThe visit comes as Haiti is fighting a massive cholera outbreakAre you in Haiti? Share your Palin images and cholera updates with CNN iReport. Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin arrived in Haiti on Saturday as part of a humanitarian delegation led by evangelist Franklin Graham and his relief organization Samaritan's Purse. "I am pleased that Gov. Palin will accompany us on a brief trip to Haiti this weekend, and I appreciate her willingness to visit Haiti during such troubled times," Graham said in a statement on the organization's website. "I believe Gov. Palin will be a great encouragement to the people of Haiti and to the organizations, both government and private, working so hard to provide desperately needed relief." Palin -- the Republican vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election -- has not commented on the widely reported trip. Many observers believe she is considering a run for president in 2012. The visit comes as Haiti is fighting a massive cholera outbreak that has killed more than 2,000 people and sickened nearly 100,000. The country has been struggling to recover from January's massive earthquake that left more than 220,000 dead. A disputed presidential election has threatened to plunge the country into further chaos. Graham's delegation is expected to stop at a cholera clinic where they will deliver holiday gifts to children under Samaritan Purse's Operation Christmas Child.

Rescue plane leaves Antarctica after picking up patient
By Josh Levs and Phil Gast, CNN
updated 5:07 PM EDT, Thu August 9, 2012
An Australian medical team flew on an A319 Airbus, similar to this one, from Christchurch, New Zealand.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Australian plane has left Antarctica for New Zealand
The patients needs medical attention
The plane uses an ice runway at McMurdo Station
The station is the hub of the U.S. Antarctic Program
(CNN) -- A patient in need of medical care was en route Thursday from a research station in Antarctica to Christchurch, New Zealand.
The patient "may require immediate corrective surgery best delivered at a more capable facility than is available at McMurdo," the National Science Foundation, which manages the U.S. Antarctic Program, said in a statement.
"The facility at McMurdo is equivalent to an urgent-care center in the U.S., and is not equipped for the type of procedure being contemplated."
The patient's identity has not been revealed publicly.
An Australian medical team, which had been asked by the United States to assist, flew into the remote research base on an A319 Airbus from Christchurch. The team landed on an ice runway at McMurdo Station about 1:15 p.m. Thursday (9:15 p.m. ET Wednesday), said Patti Lucas, spokeswoman for the Australian Antarctic Division.
They got a chilly reception: temperatures Thursday were -13 degrees Fahrenheit (-25 Celsius), according to the U.S. Antarctic Program.
The plane was airborne and en route with the patient back to Christchurch within about 75 minutes, said Debbie Wing, a spokeswoman for the U.S. National Science Foundation, which oversees the facility.
The patient was in stable condition before the plane's arrival, said Wing, adding that she could not say whether the person's condition is life-threatening.
Rescue mission to Antarctica underway
2011: Stuck at the South Pole
The mission to the hub of the U.S. Antarctic Program was occurring during the Antarctic winter, when there is little daylight for six months.
The Australian team was enlisted to carry out the rescue because no U.S. aircraft was in a position to respond quickly, the NSF said in a statement.
The U.S., Australian and New Zealand research programs in the Antarctic "have existing agreements under which such assets may be shared as needed," the statement said.
From the archives: Stranded American researcher rescued from South Pole
Wing said she could not say whether the patient had become sick or injured while at the facility, but she noted that anyone contemplating a trip to the facility must first pass "a very rigorous health screening process."
McMurdo can accommodate nearly 1,500 people, but only some 60 to 70 people stay there during the winter, when the extreme weather precludes regular flights, Wing said.
From the archives: Doctor rescued from Antarctica in 1999 dies at 57
The station, established in 1955, is built on volcanic rock on Ross Island, the solid ground farthest south that is accessible by ship, according to the NSF, an independent U.S. government agency. The station is equipped with landing strips built on sea ice and shelf ice, as well as a helicopter pad.
Researchers there conduct studies in astrophysics, biology, medicine, geology, glaciology and ocean and climate systems.
In 2010, New Zealand's air force -- in two separate incidents -- evacuated two Americans from McMurdo.
Last October, the U.S. Air Force rescued an American researcher who had suffered a suspected stroke while working at the South Pole. She was flown from the South Pole to McMurdo Station, then on to Christchurch.
In 1999, a then-47-year-old U.S. physician found a lump in her breast while stationed at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Station. Dr. Jerri Nielsen diagnosed herself with breast cancer and commenced treatment on herself with chemotherapeutic agents that were parachuted to the station.
It was later revealed, according to a March 2009 article in the Detroit Free Press, that Nielsen -- an emergency room doctor from Cleveland, Ohio -- had performed a biopsy on herself with the help of non-medical crew, who practiced using needles on a raw chicken.
Her cancer returned and Nielsen, then 57, died in 2009.

Brazil unveils shaky answer to the vuvuzela for World Cup
By Sarah Holt, CNN
updated 11:14 AM EDT, Wed July 24, 2013
The World Cup in Brazil will be filled with many noises. But what sound will the caxirola, which will be musical instrument of choice for the 2014 World Cup, make?
Designed by Brazilian composer Carlinhos Brown the caxirola make a sound similar to maracas or rainsticks.
Vuvuzelas are used regularly at football matches in South Africa but when the 2010 World Cup came to town a vuvuzela frenzy was born. But the magic of the monotone plastic horn didn't last long and they were soon banned from many grounds.
These happy fans are on their way to the English FA Cup final in 1952 but they would not be allowed to support their team using rattles or loudhailers at many global stadiums today.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The caxirola has been unveiled as the "new vuvuzela" for the 2014 World Cup
The instrument has been designed by Brazilian musician Carlinhos Brown
President Dilma Rousseff has endorsed the caxirola as a fitting symbol of Brazil
Whistles will also be produced for the 2014 World Cup
Editor's note: (CNN) -- Friends, Brazilians and soccer fans lend me your ears -- the shimmy and shake of the caxirola is coming to a football match near you soon.
The pear-shaped plastic percussion piece is to be the musical instrument of choice for the 2014 World Cup after it was given the seal of approval by Brazil's Ministry of Sport.
About time too some might argue after the raucous cacophony of the vuvuzela -- the long, plastic horn trumpeted on the terraces during the 2010 soccer World Cup in South Africa.
"For many people, the vuvuzela is very noisy, but the truth is that no one forgets," said the caxirola's inventor Brazilian composer Carlinhos Brown, who was nominated for an Oscar in 2012.
"She foretold that we should continue the pace. As a musician, I could not stop and there arose caxirola, a little less noisy."

If the buzzing vuvuzela, whose raspy monotones drew comparisons to a swarm of angry bees and divided opinion, provided the sound track to the World Cup three years ago, Brazil's aural arouser is based on the caxixi, a woven Indian instrument filled with dried beans.
Designed to produce a gentler sound -- similar to maracas or rainsticks -- and dressed in the green and yellow colours of Brazil's national flag, the caxirola has also been given a ringing endorsement by the country's President Dilma Rousseff.
"This image of the green and yellow caxirola, it enchants because of the fact that we are talking about a 'green' plastic in a country that leads in sustainability in the world," she said at the instrument's recent launch.
"And at the same time it is an object that has the ability to do two things, to combine the image with sound and take us to our goals."
Pedhua whistle
Vuvuzelas were so popular during the 2010 World Cup that manufacturers such as Masincedane Sport were selling as many as 50,000 of them a month.
Brown wants his invention to have similar mass appeal when the World Cup arrives in Brazil for its fiesta of football.
"The caxirola as with the vuvuzela, is the ball of the fans," explained Brown. "We want every South American to have a caxirola in their hands."

However, Brazil might not want their musical invention to follow quite the same path as the vuvuzela.
Attempts to ban the plastic horn during the World Cup itself may have failed but it soon found itself on the not-wanted list at global sporting tournaments.
Europe's governing soccer body UEFA banned them from all competitions, including the Champions League, the Europa League and Euro 2012 matches.
Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur were among the first English Premier League clubs to silence the vuvuzela, banning it from their grounds because of concerns over irritation and safety.
Vuvuzelas got such a bad reputation that they were also barred from the Wimbledon tennis championship at the All England Club.
Traditional football rattles, though they were lessening in popularity, also disappeared from stadiums in the 1970s because of safety concerns.
If the caxirola follows the fate of the vuvuzela or rattle, Brazil has a Plan B involving the production of a plastic version of the indigenous pedhua whistle, which mimics bird calls.
So, whoever wins the 2014 World Cup can blow their own whistle -- or do the caxirola shake.

Are we too quick to cry 'bully'?
By Jamie Gumbrecht, CNN
updated 9:47 AM EDT, Tue October 8, 2013
Rachel McAdams, left, plays Regina George, the meanest of the "Mean Girls" in the 2004 film, and she's particularly cruel and controlling toward her friends.
Just as bullying has shifted over the years, Hollywood has shifted how bullies are portrayed in film and TV. Take a look back at some of pop culture's best-known bullies.
Here Matt Dillon, second from left, is the head bully in charge of runt Chris Makepeace, right, who hires a very large classmate to take on his tormenter in the 1980 film "My Bodyguard."
In the classic tale of a bullied kid who fights back, "The Karate Kid," Ralph Macchio, right, is confronted by Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), a member of the fearsome Cobra Kai dojo.
Jason Isaacs, left, as Lucius Malfoy and Tom Felton as the mean and creepy Draco Malfoy in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 1."
Rainn Wilson, left, as Dwight Schrute and David Koechner as the crude, rude office jokester Todd Packer in "The Office."
Roy Stalin (Aaron Dozier, seated with a girl on his lap) is the captain of the high school ski team who terrorizes John Cusack's character, Lane Myer, right, in "Better Off Dead."
In "Some Kind of Wonderful," actor Craig Sheffer plays Hardy Jenns, boyfriend of Lea Thompson's character, left, and a world-class jerk.
Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) terrorizes Marty McFly Jr. (Michael J. Fox) in "Back to the Future II."
In "Valley Girl," Julie's boyfriend Tommy (MIchael Bowen) is handsome but mean as a snake.
The jocks wreak havoc on dorks like Robert Carradine's character, Lewis Skolnick, center, in "Revenge of the Nerds."
On "Glee," Tina and Kurt (Jenna Ushkowitz and Chris Colfer) get guff from high school toughs Karofsky and Azimio (Max Adler and James Earl III).
Naya Rivera plays acid-tongued cheerleader Santana on "Glee."
In the holiday classic "A Christmas Story," Zack Ward plays Scut Farkus, who's always gunning for a fight.
The dark comedy "Heathers" was the original "Mean Girls." Left to right are stars Winona Ryder, Kim Walker, Lisanne Falk and Shannen Doherty.
James Spader played the classic rich slime ball Steff opposite Molly Ringwald in "Pretty in Pink."
Lucy, far right, is a killjoy who always dampens the mood of sad sack Charlie Brown in the "Peanuts" cartoons.
Kiefer Sutherland, right, plays Ace Merrill, an older townie who gives the kids of the movie "Stand By Me" something else to fear as they go in search of a body.
Nelson Muntz, left, of "The Simpsons" will take your lunch money and add insult to injury with his signature taunt: "Haaa-haaa!"
In "Bully," Nick Stahl plays Bobby Kent, a boy who was killed by neighborhood friends after they said he tortured one of them relentlessly. The film was based on a true story.
In the '80s classic "The Breakfast Club," Judd Nelson, left, plays the tough guy to Emilio Estevez's jock, Ally Sheedy's "basket case," Molly Ringwald's popular princess and Anthony Michael Hall's nerd. It's not always clear who the bully was here.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
October is National Bullying Prevention Month, a time to raise awareness about bullying
Some say the term "bullying" has been overused, watering down its meaning
Experts: Bullying is repetitive, intentional and involves a power imbalance
Educators say it can be tough to untangle whether an incident is bullying

(CNN) -- In the last few months, the word rippled through news reports of tragic teen suicides in Connecticut, New York, Nova Scotia and Britain.
It's the same word sometimes used to describe the way reality TV stars treat one another on camera, or how unfriendly office mates interact or why grade school pals stop getting along.
Every parent, teacher and child knows the word: "bullying." But this month, as schools and communities launch fresh campaigns around National Bullying Prevention Month, some are urging more precise use of the B-word.
"Bullying," some researchers say, has been misused and abused in the last few years -- too casually uttered about every hurt, slight and fight, too frequently used in place of "teasing" or "fighting," too often brought up before there's proof it happened.
The very word, some say, has been bullied.
"By calling everything bullying, we're actually failing to recognize the seriousness of the problem," said Elizabeth Englander, a professor of psychology and founder and director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center at Bridgewater State University. "It's one of the unfortunate side effects of doing an awareness campaign ... everyone wants to adopt it."

It began a few years ago, as horrifying stories of bullying hit the media and serious awareness began to spread. Educators, lawmakers, parents and children all tried to make sense of it, even as it evolved with the latest social network. But along the way, people sometimes confused bullying with the unfortunate -- but normal -- moments of angry, thoughtless or hurtful behavior.
Actual bullying, many educators and social scientists say, is intentional, repetitive abuse by a powerful person toward a less powerful target.
But not everyone defines it the same way: Although most states have bullying laws on the books, according to the Education Commission of the States, it's handled differently around the country. New Hampshire's law specifies that an act need occur only once -- not multiple times -- to be bullying. Nebraska's law calls on local districts to create bullying policies. Several states recently added provisions to cover cyberbullying -- bullying or harassment through technology. Laws in Massachusetts and New Jersey detail how educators should prevent, report and investigate bullying.
Say the word in almost any school these days, and it will get a quick reaction. In many cases, advocates said, that's helpful. But sometimes, when it's not really bullying, kids miss out on a chance to learn to cope with minor conflicts on their own.
"The label 'bullying' is really incendiary," Englander said. "It ratchets everything up emotionally. It makes it hard to really address, rationally, what the best course of action is."
The people hurt most by the overuse of "bullying," Englander said, are young people most desperate for a solution -- those in the midst of very real, traumatic instances of bullying, students whose pain might be overlooked in a crush of reported cases.
"Being deliberately isolated and laughed at cruelly every single day can be devastating socially and academically, because the target must both endure the present and constantly dread the future," Englander wrote in the book "Bullying and Cyberbulling," released this month. "It's this unrelenting cruelty and the callous nature of such an environment that is watered down when we include every social slight or quarrel under the bullying rubric."
"If everyone's a victim," she wrote, "then no one's a victim."
Still, some educators and parents worry that even scaling back on the word "bullying" could put a chill on training and conversations about bullying -- and quash the newfound courage some have found to stand up against it.
'It wasn't all that simple'
Even after years of training, it can be hard to untangle the threads of a possible bullying case.

Expert: Cyberbullying can be final straw
Becki Cohn-Vargas, an educator for more than two decades, recalled how conflicts between students were never as black-and-white as they seemed at first. A child who bullied might express remorse, then relapse. A girl would complain of bullying by a child she'd once targeted. LGBT students in a school known for its kind atmosphere would quietly admit to daily torment. Religious students were targeted, and secular students, too. All over the playground and lunchroom, students might freeze out another child, demeaning him without saying a word.
To identify a child as a bully or victim was difficult -- and dangerous.
"As a principal, parents would come to my school and you'd kind of dig in, and it wasn't all that simple," Cohn-Vargas said. "It's not like there are bad bullies and good kids. Every kid is able to do some kind of bullying behavior."
People should be diligent about how they use the word bullying, Cohn-Vargas said, but that doesn't mean they should stop talking about it. As the director of Not in Our School, she now advocates creating "identity safe" schools. The idea is to prevent bullying and create a positive learning spaces by teaching kids about each others' cultures and encouraging them to step up if they believe someone will be hurt by another person's actions.
Englander, of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center, suggests teachers and parents talk with students immediately if they see a behavior that violates social norms; whether it's the only time it has happened, or it's part of a bullying situation, young people need to hear right away that it's not OK to whisper about others or tease people, for example.
But even schools that feel safe will sometimes experience fist fights, tearful teasing -- and bullying. After many years of research and practice, Cohn-Vargas now knows she shouldn't respond to them all the same way, and that bullying prevention training has to be ongoing.
"It's not a one-shot assembly or learn the rules thing," she said. "You have to have a really good understanding of the definition, and everyone has to know how to respond."
It's one thing to train teachers and school staff members, but it can be tough to train people outside the school, especially parents.
"Nothing was bullying 25 years ago. It was kids being kids. Not saying it was right, but parents thought it was part of growing up," said Kevin Quinn, president of the National Association of School Resource Officers. "Now we see a lot of parents trying to generalize what bullying is -- any time kids do something to each other, let's call it bullying and deal with it that way."
At the Arizona high school where he works, they get more reports of bullying than they once did, but they also spend time researching whether they're really onetime scrapes, minor offenses, criminal activities that should be handled by police or acts of bullying that need to be reported to administration.
"The last thing we want to do is start turning every single kid in the school into a suspect," he said. "You've got to train teachers, staff, get information to parents. The definition (of bullying) is only as good as the people that know it."
'Not a word we're afraid to use'
Susan Guess now knows the definition by heart, for reasons she never could have imagined.
Just a few years ago, neither Guess nor her daughter, Morgan, thought they needed to know much about bullying. She was a fixture in her daughter's classroom. They were close, always talking. If there was ever a problem, she was sure Morgan would tell her.
But when Morgan entered third grade, Guess began to notice a few changes -- little things, like how Morgan walked past her friends to spend time with one girl, or how that girl always seemed to lead Morgan around. Morgan mentioned nothing, and at first, Guess didn't ask. When she finally did, Morgan was ready to talk.
The girl was pinching her and pulling her hair, Morgan said. She might elbow her in the back one day, and hold her hand the next. She wouldn't let her play with her other friends. If she complained, Morgan feared it would get worse.
The girl wanted to be her friend, Morgan explained, but she didn't know how.
Meanwhile, Morgan had grown anxious and depressed. She began to have stomach spasms, and to struggle more academically. The realization made Guess felt a little ill, too.
"Our schools spent time talking about the issue, but she did not know -- and I had not equipped her -- with the skills she needed to stand up for herself," Guess said, recalling those hard months two years ago.
Guess worked with the school to separate the girls, and the physical bullying mostly stopped. Guess would still sometimes find the child trying to block Morgan -- "a power play" -- or inserting herself among Morgan's friends.
Eventually, the girl changed schools.
Guess realized, though, that just as her daughter struggled to tell an adult what was happening, parents might not realize that their children were being bullied, or might worry they'd be seen as a troublemaker.
The mother and daughter launched the Guess Anti-Bullying Foundation to help educate their western Kentucky community about what bullying looks like, and how to create kinder, more empathetic schools. It can be difficult: Schools can't label a bully with the "Scarlet B," she said, but it was hard to feel any sensitivity toward the girl who'd hurt her daughter.
She's grateful for the education she's received on bullying, but doesn't believe the word is overused. You have to say it, she said, to help children understand which relationships are healthy, which ones aren't, and how to help a person in need.
"A child is suffering, and we spend so much time saying, 'This is bullying, this isn't bullying,' " Guess said. "If we've gained anything, I hope we're better people, more sensitive to our interactions with other people."
At age 10, Morgan is now doing wonderfully, Guess said. She's stronger academically, less shy than before and has been honored for her work to help people understand bullying. Bully, Guess said, "is not a word we're afraid to use anymore."
Last month, as Guess walked through the hallway of her daughter's school, she noticed a handwritten poster hanging on the wall.
"What is a bully?" it said in a child's writing, a small heart atop the "I."
"A bully is a bigger or stronger person that hurts or frightens a smaller or weaker person on purpose," it answered in rainbow letters, "over and over again."
Guess snapped a photo, and posted it on her anti-bullying foundation's Facebook page: "Every single act of education," she wrote,"makes a difference."

Chow Yun-fat and Zhang Ziyi in a scene from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
Martial Masterpiece
Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun-fat and two young stunners help director Ang Lee fashion a thrilling action drama that roars and soars
By RICHARD CORLISS From the beginning, the film seemed cursed. "We started shooting in the Gobi Desert," Ang Lee recalls. "That night, the crew got lost in the desert and it wasn't until 7 a.m. that we found them. We delayed shooting until 2 p.m. After the second shot, a sandstorm came in." Halfway through the shoot, cast and crew looked like survivors of the Long March, with no Tiananmen Square triumph in sight. "We shot around the clock with two teams," says the 45-year-old director, dimpled but unsmiling. "I didn't take one break in eight months, not even for half a day. I was miserableI just didn't have the extra energy to be happy. Near the end, I could hardly breathe; I thought I was about to have a stroke. It was bad. Six months later, I'm still resting now, trying to get fit again. But since I'm middle-aged, I'll probably never come back to normal."
The gentle listener wants to shout: "It's only a movie, Ang." But people working on even the lamest film know it's never only a movie. So much is at stake. So many egos, fragments of an artistic vision or commercial ambition, battling like Qing Dynasty swordsmasters. It's amazingnot that a film emerges from this mix of summer camp and boot camp, but that the combatants survive and come back for more.

Back to China In the martial-arts drama Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee and a cast of big stars struggle with moviemaking on the mainland (11/29/99)
PHOTOESSAY
On Set With Ang Lee
Elaborate sets, derring-do and big stars are all found in the martial-arts drama "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" Now consider the cinematic and emotional vectors converging in Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. A $15 million action movie and a poignant tragic romance. A fight choreographer, Yuen Wo-ping, who had won international acclaim for his work on The Matrix and was bound to tangle with the soft-spoken, hard-to-budge Lee. A top-flight, all-Asian cast, with Chow Yun-fat (Hong Kong), Michelle Yeoh (Malaysia), Zhang Ziyi (Beijing) and Chang Chen (Taiwan). Only one of the castZhang, then a 19-year-old ingenuespoke anything like the mainland Mandarin that Lee demanded. (Lee, also raised in Taiwan, didn't speak it either.) At least these dangers were built into the scenario. What no one expected was that Yeoh would break her knee and need a month's rehab, or that it would rain sheets in the Gobi.
As the sage said: dying is easy, filmmaking is hard. But everyone was so serious on Crouching Tiger because Lee, who made his reputation with adult dramas-of-manners like The Wedding Banquet and Sense and Sensibility, had a child inside screaming to get out. He was finally ready to pay homage to his lifelong ardor for martial-arts novels and pictures. He had made beautiful films; now he would bend his considerable artistry to make, dammit, a movie. And nothing only about it.
Now that Crouching Tiger is opening in Asia, after stoking enthrallment at this May's Cannes Festival, viewers can see that all the agony produced exactly what Lee hoped to create: a blending, not a collision, of Eastern physical grace and Western intensity of performance, of Hong Kong kung-fu directness and British attention to behavioral nuance. Chinese stars convene from three movie eras: pioneer kung-femme Cheng Peipei from the '60s, Chow and Yeoh from Hong Kong's glorious '80s, and bright new lights Zhang and Chang. The fight scenes evoke grand old movies with computer technology. It's contemplative, and it kicks ass. High art meets high spirits on the trampoline of the movie's plot. Lee initially described the film to Yeoh as "Sense and Sensibility with martial arts." But it's not a hybrid; it's a new, exotic strain. Put it this way: a powerful film, a terrific movie.
Based on part of a Wang Dulu novel that runs to several volumes and thousands of pages, the script by James Schamus, Wang Huiling and Tsai Kuojung concerns the theft of a sword, the Green Destiny. This is the holy weapon of Li Mubai (Chow), a noble and expert warrior looking for peace in his later days. He entrusts the sword to Yu Shulien (Yeoh), a gifted martial artist with whom he shares an unspoken love. Then Jen (Zhang), daughter of a political bigwig, arrives, and everything tips off-balance. The wiser, more cautious adults are both drawn to and upset by Jen's beauty and vagrant energy. They sense Jen's avidity for rare toys like the Green Destiny. They are also suspicious of her governess (Cheng Peipei), who bears a resemblance to Jade Fox, a ruthless thief and the killer of Li Mubai's master. And then one night, the sword disappears.

The Green Destiny is what Hitchcock called the MacGuffin: the object that kick-starts the adventure and puts everyone in frantic, purposeful motion. In Crouching Tiger, that motion has its own poetry; for these semi-gods and demidevils have a buoyancy to match their gravity. The film's first action scene, with Shulien chasing the sword's thief (who, we soon learn, is Jen), sets the tone and the rules. The two fight hand-to-hand and foot-to-foot, with elbows at the ready. Jen suddenly floats up, as if on the helium of her young arrogance, and cantors up and down the courtyard walls as if they were velvet carpets, with Shulien in graceful pursuit. Jen executes a squat spin, then rises like a vertical dervish and escapes. At its screenings in Cannes, this scene was greeted with spontaneous applause, even from those professional misanthropes, the critics. From that moment on, Crouching Tiger had the Riviera swells in its pocket. They gasped with glee as Jen and Jade Fox soared into the night (Who does that? Angels and witches). They misted up at the friendship of Mubai and Shulien, two brave warriors who haven't quite the courage to say I love you. They happily took the film's 20-minute detour to the Gobi, where in a flashback Jen meets her bandit beau Lo (Chang) and makes love with the spontaneity of a first-time tryst and the calculation of a girl who has to be on top. (Forget the tepid marriage her father has arranged. Jen wants to love a fighter and fight her lover.) At the end, they sobbed farewell to an old friend who gives a beautiful valediction. To Western viewers, Crouching Tiger has the tang of novelty. But Asian moviegoers, especially those of Lee's age, need no scholarship to plumb the lore of martial arts, or wuxia (knightly chivalry). In the '60s and early '70s young men came to maturityor were pickled in adolescencewatching sabre-rattling heroes of both sexes in such classics as Chang Cheh's The Golden Swallow (starring Cheng Peipei, the avenging villainess of Lee's film) and King Hu's epic A Touch of Zen. Some of the Crouching set-pieces, like Jen's one-woman stand against half a dozen marauders at an inn, are echoes of more recent films; Yeoh herself laid righteous waste to many a hostelry (in Tai Chi Master, Wing Chun, etc.). But as a newly illustrated memory book of youthful obsession, the movie has its roots in films of 30 years agobefore and after Bruce Lee. In A Touch of Zen, the knights prudently do battle under bamboo trees. Lee had the inspiredor crackpotidea to stage the fight between Mubai and Jen on the tree's branches. Says Zhang: "I had to swing up and down, swirl and remember to try and act, all at the same time." Chow was grateful to the action director: "Wo-ping gave me as much protection as he could. He knows I'm not a martial arts man. And when you're hanging 60 feet up in the air in a bamboo forest, you need protection."
When he thinks about the scene, Lee is both chagrined and giddy. "It's nuts," he says. "It's sexy. Nobody wanted to do it. And there's a reason why people don't do that: because it's almost impossible! The first three days of shooting we did were a complete waste of time. There were 20 or 30 guys below the actors trying to make them float. It was just chaotic." Finally it worked: a scene so buoyant that the audience roars and soars along with the stars.

In other martial-arts scenes, it was Yuen, the old action pro, who had to bring Lee back to earth. "Ang would say he didn't want to shoot things the Wo-ping way because it was an Ang Lee movie," Chow recalls. "But his ideas couldn't be worked out in reality. Finally, he'd go to Wo-ping and say 'Master, I'm wrong. Let's do it your way now.'" Lee doesn't dispute this account of his Method martial artistry. "I wanted kung fu to be a dramatic experience as well as a performing experience," he says. "I wanted action, suspense and emotionand those are almost contradictory things. I'd fantasized about this since boyhood, and I was full of ideas, but a lot of them weren't feasible or didn't look good. It was difficult for Wo-ping and distracting to the actors." Lee is a visionary and a perfectionist; the movie he's directing rarely measures up to the one in his mind's eye. "The art of film," he says, "is the art of regret." So he fights for what he can get, which is often more than his colleagues can freely give. "Detail by detail, we had to find a way to make things work. And the actors aren't machines. After a few takes they're worn out. Then you're doing Take 31, and things are getting worse instead of better." Yet Lee's doggedness impressed and inspired at least one participant: Yeoh. "Usually when we do martial arts," she says, "we shift the focusthe action becomes everything. But here there's such a balance. It's emotional, it's dramatic. It transcends everything." Lee might not like to compromise, but he has to adapt. He had first thought of Jet Li, he of the flying feet and dour demeanor, as Li Mubai. When Chow took the role, the action scenes were reduced but the character ripened. And, at times, what seems like a disappointment can be a sweet surprise. That was the revelation of Zhang Ziyi. For all its pan-Asian star power, the movie depends on Jen and the actress who plays her. When first seen, Jen seems lovely but unformed, a dreamy adventuress who wants the freedom of the heroes she reads about. In one sense, she's the spoiled rich girl with a racing emotional motor. She aches for the forbidden thrill because she knows she would like itand knows she'd be good at it. Gradually, though, Jen (or, rather, Zhang) reveals the steel will beneath her silky waysand a more toxic, intoxicating beauty. On the cusp of womanhood, she could tumble either way: become a fearless heroine or a ferocious harlot. We know that she is guilty of one theft: she steals the film.
Everything is pretty in movies, but nothing is easy. And that includes Zhang's immersion into the character. She got to know the actor who would play her demon lover because, as Chang says, "We took acting lessons before we started the parts, so we were familiar with each other before shooting started." Lee's pre-production instructions to the young actor were simple: eat. "My biggest task was to put on weight, as the director said I was too skinny." (He bulked up fine; he's halfway to hunkdom.) But Lee had stricter demands of his starlet. "For a time," he says, "she was nowhere near where I thought Jen should be. But when you can't get something to work, you improvise. If the mountain doesn't turn around, make the world turn around. So we made the character closer to her until there was a meeting in the middle. We veered the movie toward her. She is very sexy and we thought, sure, let's use that. It makes things start to happen. She is the most marvellous thing I've found."
Zhang Ziyi, though a game gal, was not schooled in martial arts, so lithe young stunt doubles, male and female, executed the more strenuous feats. "To find a good stuntwoman," Lee says, "is harder than finding a good wife." And to find a woman who is tops in stuntwork, acting and all-round allure is almost impossible. That's why Yeoh is so precious. On one good leg or two, she wore those wires, scaled those walls. Russel Wong for TIME.
Malaysian-born actress Michelle Yeoh is no stranger to action-packed films.
"I've waited 15 years to work with this guy," says Yeoh, who signed on early and accompanied Lee on some location scouting. "He's gentle and very emotional. During a sad scene at the end of the film, he kept telling me to do different things, and when he'd come over I saw he was red-eyed, teary. I could barely look at him. He gets so completely involved. And when he says, 'Good take,' after a shot, he really means it." For Lee, that was a great take. "I know those weren't 'acting' tears, they were real tears. It works, and it brought tears to my eyes. Michelle had to cry in every take, for five hours. At the end she was drained."
Lee drove Yeoh nearly to tears with his insistence on precise Mandarin speech. "I don't think I studied this hard even for exams," says the actress, whose family language was English. "Every single word needs the right intonation. I'd deliver a 16-line speech, get one word slightly wrong and Ang would say, 'Let's do it all again.' I'd say, 'Can't we just do the one word again?' 'No, let's do it all.' So many times I thought, 'I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid, why are you using me?' But it builds character. If you don't listen to Ang, then you're gonna do it again and again, so you'd better listen up." After two Hollywood tough-guy films and a lovely turn as the King of Siam in The King and I, Chow was used to learning a new language with each script: "First English, then Thai, now this." But the experience was, as he says, "awful. The first day I had to do 28 takes just because of the language. That's never happened before in my life. It gave me a lot pressure."
So Chang and Zhang went to acting school; Chow and Yeoh crammed to speak Mandarin. And throughout, Lee was learning the limitations in the laws of stunt physics from Yuen. Movies, like life, are an education on the fly, with pop quizzes every moment. How apt, then, that the theme of Crouching Tiger should be teaching. In this war of the generations, the adults are as eager to instruct the young as the kids are to rebel against authority. And the wicked carry grievances for years. Jade Fox says she killed Mubai's master because "he would sleep with me but never teach me" the secrets of wuxia; and she bitterly resents Jen because the child hoarded martial lore for herself. Here, knowledge is power. And only the most powerful, like Mubai, can share it. The star pupil, of course, is Jen, and the film's main question is: From whom will she agree to learn? Shulien and Mubai both want to test themselves against her precocity. But for Mubai it is a mission. "What do you want?" Jen asks him, and he replies, "What I've always wantedto teach you." For him education is a kind of intellectual and ethical parenting. Teaching this bright, willful girl is as close as he will come to fatherhoodeven if, as he must be aware, the job carries fatal risks.
"She needs direction and training," Mubai says of Jen." Surely that is Ang Lee speaking. A film director is the ultimate father figure, doling out responsibility, praise and censure. On Crouching Tiger, Lee, who secured his early fame with the so-called Father Knows Best trilogy (Pushing Hands, The Wedding Banquet, Eat Drink Man Woman), was a father-teacher to Zhang the budding actress, to Yeoh the first-year Mandarin student, to Chow the man on the flying bamboo. And behind Lee was another family figure: the young Ang, mesmerized by tales of great fighters and images of impossible physical grace. However much the middle-aged Ang Lee suffered in making this exquisite film, he should take a little pleasure knowing he helped realize the young Ang Lee's dream. Reported by Stephen Short/Hong Kong Write to TIME at mail@web.timeasia.com This edition's table of contents TIME Asia home Quick Scroll: More stories from TIME, Asiaweek and CNN LATEST HEADLINES: WASHINGTONU.S. secretary of state says China should be 'tolerant'

About the project
Photographs by Christopher Griffith
Analysis of polling, voting patterns, political spending and other trends led CNN to six types of undecided voters being targeted by the campaigns -- and then, to these six individuals in six battleground states. They speak for themselves, of course, and not for their demographics. But their stories illuminate the intersection between real life and politics, where personal histories, challenges and hopes mirror those of the nation. Writers and videographers spent several days with each, documenting their lives and the complexity of the choices they will make on November 6. A photographer captured the essence of The Undecided in portraits and still-life images.
