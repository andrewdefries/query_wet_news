Helping establish stability and security
HIGHLIGHTS
� Introduction � Handing over authority to a sovereign Iraqi government � Helping establish stability and security � Continue rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure � Encouraging more international support � Moving toward free national elections � Completing the transition "The second step in the plan for Iraqi democracy is to help establish the stability and security that democracy requires."Coalition forces and the Iraqi people have the same enemies: the terrorists, illegal militia and Saddam loyalists who stand between the Iraqi people and their future as a free nation. Working as allies, we will defend Iraq and defeat these enemies."America will provide forces and support necessary for achieving these goals."Our commanders had estimated that a troop level below 115,000 would be sufficient at this point in the conflict. Given the recent increase in violence, we will maintain our troop level at the current 138,000 as long as necessary."This has required extended duty for the 1st Armored Division and the 2nd Light Cavalry Regiment -- 20,000 men and women who were scheduled to leave Iraq in April. Our nation appreciates their hard work and sacrifice, and they can know that they will be heading home soon."General Abizaid and other commanders in Iraq are constantly assessing the level of troops they need to fulfill the mission. If they need more troops, I will send them. The mission of our forces in Iraq is demanding and dangerous. Our troops are showing exceptional skill and courage. I thank them for their sacrifices and their duty. In the city of Fallujah there has been considerable violence by Saddam loyalists and foreign fighters, including the murder of four American contractors. American soldiers and Marines could have used overwhelming force."Our commanders, however, consulted with Iraq's governing council and local officials and determined that massive strikes against the enemy would alienate the local population and increase support for the insurgency."So we have pursued a different approach. We're making security a shared responsibility in Fallujah. Coalition commanders have worked with local leaders to create an all-Iraqi security force, which is now patrolling the city."Our soldiers and Marines will continue to disrupt enemy attacks on our supply routes, conduct joint patrols with Iraqis to destroy bomb factories and safe houses, and kill or capture any enemy. We want Iraqi forces to gain experience and confidence in dealing with their country's enemies. We want the Iraqi people to know that we trust their growing capabilities, even as we help build them."At the same time, Fallujah must cease to be a sanctuary for the enemy. And those responsible for terrorism will be held to account."In the cities of Najaf and Karbala and Kufa, most of the violence has been decided by a young radical cleric who commands an illegal militia. These enemies have been hiding behind an innocent civilian population, storing arms and ammunition in mosques and launching attacks from holy shrines."Our soldiers have treated religious sites with respect, while systematically dismantling the illegal militia."We're also seeing Iraqis themselves take more responsibility for restoring order. In recent weeks, Iraqi forces have ejected elements of this militia from the governor's office in Najaf."Yesterday, an elite Iraqi unit cleared out a weapons cache from a large mosque in Kufa. Respected Shia leaders have called on the militia to withdraw from these towns. Ordinary Iraqis have marched in protest against the militants. As challenges rise in Fallujah, Najaf and elsewhere, the tactics of our military will be flexible."Commanders on the ground will pay close attention to local conditions and we will do all that is necessary by measured force or overwhelming force to achieve a stable Iraq."Iraq's military police and border forces have begun to take on broader responsibilities. Eventually, they must be the primary defenders of Iraqi security as American and coalition forces are withdrawn. And we're helping them to prepare for this role."In some cases, the early performance of Iraqi forces fell short. Some refused orders to engage the enemy. We've learned from these failures and we've taken steps to correct them."Successful fighting units need a sense of cohesion so we've lengthened and intensified their training. Successful units need to know they are fighting for the future of their own country, not for any occupying power. So we are ensuring that Iraqi forces serve under an Iraqi chain of command. Successful fighting units need the best possible leadership. So we improved the vetting and training of Iraqi officers and senior enlisted men."At my direction and with the support of Iraqi authorities, we are accelerating our program to help train Iraqis to defend their country."A new team of senior military officers is now assessing every unit in Iraq's security forces. I've asked this team to oversee the training of a force of 260,000 Iraqi soldiers, police and other security personnel. Five Iraqi army battalions are in the field now, with another eight battalions to join them by July 1st."The eventual goal is an Iraqi army of 35,000 soldiers in 27 battalions fully prepared to defend their country."After June 30th, American and other forces will still have important duties. American military forces in Iraq will operate under American command as a part of a multinational force authorized by the United Nations."Iraq's new sovereign government will still face enormous security challenges and our forces will be there to help."Continue rebuilding iraq's infrastructure >>Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

Researchers spend year at ends of Earth
By Marsha Walton CNN Adjust font size:
(CNN) -- During International Polar Year, scientists from more than 60 countries are working at the far ends of the Earth, looking for clues about climate change, weather forecasting, even cures for diseases.This is the fourth time scientists have cooperated on such a research mission. Earlier studies took place in 1882-83, 1932-33, and 1957-58."We are in a completely different place than 50 years ago. There are amazing new technologies," said David Carlson, Professor of Oceanography at Oregon State University in Corvallis. He is serving as director of the International Polar Year International Program Office.Carlson said researchers can talk to each other, share photos, video and data nearly instantaneously -- they won't have to wait months for scientific papers to be published."We want to make the process of the science as immediate and accessible as possible," Carlson said.What's also different about this endeavor, said Carlson, is the human dimension. Along with glaciologists, astronomers and geophysicists, there are anthropologists, sociologists, physicians and linguists gathering the perspectives of indigenous people in the polar regions.Carlson says it takes a tremendous amount of work to get scientists, their governments, and funding together for such a big undertaking. For the current polar study, there's the additional urgency of monitoring polar changes tied to climate change.The International Council for Science and the World Meteorological Organization are co-sponsors of the International Polar Year, which began March 1.The communication and interactivity also is allowing students and anyone else interested to monitor the research."Public interest helps a lot," said Carlson. "The public looks at polar environments as exotic and attractive and visually stunning. That's a very powerful combination," he said. Tools:	Save |

Judges say Franken is winner of Senate race Story Highlights Judges: Democrat Al "Franken is entitled to receive the certificate of election" Franken led Republican Norm Coleman by 225 votes after recount Coleman went to court over some absentee ballots Decision could still be appealed to state Supreme Court Next Article in Politics » MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- A three-judge panel ruled Monday against Republican Norm Coleman in his dispute with Democrat Al Franken over who should be declared the winner of the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota. GOP Sen. Norm Coleman, left, and Democrat Al Franken are in a battle for a Minnesota Senate seat. The judges determined that "Franken is entitled to receive the certificate of election" after defeating Coleman by 312 votes. The Minnesota secretary of state is unlikely to issue that certificate, however, until all legal proceedings have been completed. Coleman has 10 days to appeal the 68-page ruling to the state Supreme Court and could opt to continue into the federal arena if he loses at the state level. Defense attorney Ben Ginsberg told CNN that the court's order "wrongly disenfranchised" thousands of voters. "The court's ruling tonight is consistent with how they've ruled throughout this case but inconsistent with the Minnesota tradition of enfranchising voters," he said. "This order ignores the reality of what happened in the counties and cities on Election Day in terms of counting the votes. "By its own terms, the court has included votes it has found to be 'illegal' in the contest to remain included in the final counts from Election Day, and equal protection and due process concerns have been ignored. For these reasons, we must appeal to the Minnesota Supreme Court so that no voter is left behind." Franken, saying he was confident he would eventually be certified, urged Coleman not to appeal and to "let me get to work as soon as possible." "The campaign for this Senate seat has been long and expensive," he told reporters outside his home. "The fight ahead, the fight to rebuild our economy and broken healthcare system and to restore our standing in the world, that's a fight we must win. It's a fight we must win by setting aside partisan gamesmanship and working together." Coleman, the freshman senator who's seeking a second term, led Franken after Election Day by 215 votes out of nearly 3 million cast in the contest. That tiny margin triggered an automatic recount, which took nearly two months to complete. Franken, the progressive radio talk show host, comedian, and former cast member of "Saturday Night Live," led by 225 votes after the statewide recount results were announced at the beginning of this year. Coleman contested the results and took the case to court. The key issue in the proceedings was whether some rejected absentee ballots should have been included in the recount. Earlier in the process, the panel allowed the addition of more than 300 wrongly excluded absentee ballots, resulting in 198 more votes for Franken and 111 more for Coleman. But Monday's decision dismisses Coleman's complaint and orders him to pay attorneys' fees. The court rejected Coleman's arguments that Minnesota's election laws violate the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution, acknowledging that some errors were made but that the simple fact of an error does not automatically rise to the level of a violation. "Equal protection does not guarantee a perfect election," the judges wrote. Further, the judges said, equal protection does not require that each county in the state handle ballots "with rigid sameness." The bottom line, the judges said, was that Coleman failed to meet the burden of proof and especially, they said, did not show that "errors or irregularities affected the outcome of the election." "The overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that the November 4, 2008, election was conducted fairly, impartially and accurately," the judges wrote in an addendum to the ruling. "After seven weeks of trial, the factual record is devoid of any allegations of fraud, tampering, or security breaches on Election Day, during the recount process, or during the election contest," they wrote. "On the contrary, the general election resulted in a 'fair expression' of the voters of Minnesota. If Franken is ultimately determined to be the winner, he would become the 59th member of the Democrats' coalition in a chamber that requires 60 votes to break a filibuster.

Sculptor shows softer side of formidable Ferguson
By Tom McGowan, CNN
updated 10:59 AM EST, Fri November 23, 2012
Like Alex Ferguson, sculptor Philip Jackson was born in Scotland. Here he is pictured working on The Bomber Command Memorial Sculpture, which is situated in London's Green Park, and was unveiled by the Queen in June.
Jackson was also the artist who created the statue of former England captain Bobby Moore, which is located at Wembley Stadium. The statue, standing six meters in height and weighing approximately two tons, commemorates when Moore captained England to World Cup glory in 1966.
The Alex Ferguson sculpture is the third Manchester United piece Jackson has produced. His statue of George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton, which stands outside Old Trafford, depicts three of the club's greatest players.
Jackson's first Manchester United related sculpture depicted former manager Matt Busby, who was a key figure in creating the club's attacking philosophy of football which Ferguson has helped maintain.
Jackson's bronze scultpture of Ferguson is nine foot in height. It will be unveiled ahead of United's home game against Queens Park Rangers on November 23.
A number of other English clubs have commissioned artworks to remember former managers, notably Bobby Robson, who managed a number of clubs including Ipswich Town, Barcelona and Newcastle United as well as England. This statue of Robson is outside Newcastle United's St James' Park.
Manchester United's great rivals Liverpool have a statue of former Scottish manager Bill Shankly outside their Anfield ground.
It is not just managers and players who have been immortalized in sculpture form. In Baku, Azerbaijan, there is a statue of the 1966 World Cup final linesman Tofig Bahramov outside the Tofig Bahramov stadium. Here former West Germany goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski and former England striker Sir Geoff Hurst are pictured standing next to the the Bahramov statue in June 2011.
The moment French football superstar Zinedine Zidane headbutted Italy's Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup final has been immortalized in a five meter bronze statue. The statue, positioned outside of Paris' Pompidou Museum, is the work of Algerian-born artist Adel Abdessemed.
More unusually in April 2011, Fulham chairman Mohamed Al Fayed unveiled a statue in tribute to singer Michael Jackson, who died in 2009, outside the English Premier League club's Craven Cottage ground. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Alex Ferguson will be honored with a statue outside Man Utd's stadium
The nine-meter bronze sculpture will be unveiled on November 23
Briton Philip Jackson is the artist commissioned to produce the artwork
Jackson has worked with United on two previous commissions
(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson is the legendary Manchester United coach who once sent a boot flying into the face of David Beckham, but a British sculptor has revealed a softer side to the formidable Scot.
Ferguson recently celebrated 26 years as United's manager this week, during which time he has won trophies at home and abroad as well as gaining a fierce reputation for the "hairdryer treatment" he dishes out to his players.
But that was not the man sculptor Philip Jackson encountered after being commissioned to produce a nine-foot bronze statue of Ferguson which was unveiled on Friday with a host of United legends in attendance.
"He's a very interesting character," Jackson, based in the English county of Sussex, told CNN when asked about the 70-year-old United boss.
"He's much more than you seen on the television.
"When he came down to the studio he said, 'Did you know that Gore Vidal had died?' and 'Have you read the new biography of Charles de Gaulle?' He's a very well-read man."
Artist Michael Kirkbride's painting, "Armchair Ride," was inspired by a poem about Frankel demolishing the field in last year's 2000 Guineas race.
Kirkbride painted the piece in egg tempura; a mixture of colored pigment and egg yolk which dates back to the 1st Century.
The British artist is perhaps best known for his paintings of English football scenes, including "Bar Kick," a surrealist look at sporting revelry in a pub. British thoroughbred Frankel remained unbeaten in 14 consecutive races. The colt won his last ever race in the Champions Stakes at Ascot.
Leonardo da Vinci's 16th Century masterpiece "Mona Lisa," on display in Paris's Musee du Louvre, is one of the most visited artworks in the world. The famous portrait is thought to be of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo. Pablo Picasso's 1937 painting "Weeping Woman" depicted long-time mistress Dora Maar. Their notoriously tempestuous relationship lasted nine years.
Frida Kahlo was the wife and muse of Mexican artist Diego Rivera. An acclaimed artist in her own right, today Frida is the more renowned of the pair, with actress Salma Hayek playing her in the 2002 biographical film "Frida."
Spanish artist Salvador Dali's wife Gala featured in many of his works, including 1949 painting "The Madonna of Port Lligat". She was also the muse of first husband, French poet Paul Eluard.
Andy Warhol catapulted model and actress Edie Sedgwick to "It Girl" status in his avant-garde films of the 1960s.
British artist Lucien Freud caused a stir with his 1995 painting of Job Centre supervisor Sue Tilley, called "Benefits Supervisor Sleeping." The naked woman weighed around 127kg at the time.

My muse: A race horse called Frankel
Expectation weighs on Andy Murray at Wimbledon every year, with the British crowd eager to see one of the nation's male tennis players win the singles title for the first time since 1936.
Murray has assumed the position once held by Tim Henman as Britain's premier tennis hope. Henman reached the Wimbledon semifinals on four occasions between 1998 and 2002.
It has become a Wimbledon tradition for fans to gather on a large grassy bank outside of Centre Court to watch games on a large screen. The area was once known as "Henman Hill" and has since been rechristened "Murray Mound".
The last British winner of the men's singles title was the great Fred Perry, who won Wimbledon in three consecutive years between 1934, 1935 and 1936. British tennis fans aren't the only supporters who have had to wait for glory. The Boston Red Sox won baseball's World Series five times between 1903 and 1918.

Sport's longest waits
Over the last quarter of a century, Ferguson has overseen United's ascent to the top of English football.
The Old Trafford team has won 12 league titles under his stewardship, helping it to a record 19 English championships overall, in addition to two European Champions League triumphs.
Benign expression
Raised in the working-class district of Govan in Glasgow, the 70-year-old Ferguson is a staunch supporter of the British Labour Party.
As a manager Ferguson has a no-nonsense reputation, letting go of top players like Beckham, Roy Keane, Jaap Stam and Ruud van Nistelrooy when he senses they have outlived their usefulness to the United cause.
A long-running spat with the BBC saw Ferguson refuse to speak with the British broadcaster for seven years after a 2004 documentary made unproven allegations of wrongdoing against his football agent son Jason.
But fellow Scotsman Jackson wanted to capture a different side of Ferguson for the sculpture which was unveiled during a ceremony ahead of Saturday's match with Queens Park Rangers -- the team he faced in his first match in charge at Old Trafford in 1986.
"I wanted him to have a slightly benign expression on his face, so that's what he's got. He's wearing the sort of clothes he would wear at a match in the winter."
Amalgam
Jackson was already known to United's hierarchy after producing sculptures of former manager Matt Busby and the legendary playing trio of George Best, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law.
"I'd already done the Matt Busby sculpture for Manchester United some 12-15 years ago," said Jackson, who in his role as royal sculptor has produced works ranging from the archangel Gabriel and Constantine the Great to the young Mozart.
"I did the United trinity of Best, Charlton and Law and when that was completed we talked about doing Alex. I didn't do anything immediately.
"There was an opportunity when his 25th anniversary came up and they decided to name a stand after him. So it was decided it should be done to go in front of that."
Read: Man Utd buy out sponsor
In order to do justice to a man as respected as Ferguson, Jackson built up an in-depth knowledge of his personality and appearance during several meetings.
"I went up to see him, took a lot of photographs of him and spent some time watching him at a match," explained Jackson, who also produced a sculpture of England's World Cup-winning squad of 1966 which is outside Wembley Stadium.
"I got a lot of photographs from the Manchester United archives and also a lot of books that had been written about him.
It has been suggested the rivalry between the cities of Manchester and Liverpool can be traced back to the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal. Tired of paying their dues to import through the Mersey estuary, Manchester merchants built their own waterway, leaving Liverpudlian dock workers disgruntled and out of pocket.
Both United and Liverpool are have had to endure their fair share of tragedies. United lost an entire generation of young, promising stars in 1958, when a plane carrying the team back from a European Cup match in Belgrade crashed on a snowy runway in Munich -- killing eight players.
The shadow of the 1989 Hillsborough Stadium disaster has loomed large over Liverpool for over two decades. A total of 96 Liverpool fans lost their lives in a fatal crush before and during an FA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest. An independent report recently released absolved Liverpool fans of any blame for the tragedy, instead pointing the finger of blame at the authorities.
At times, the two sets have fans have used the two tragedies as a way of trying to provoke each other. On the pitch, this picture shows Manchester United captain Gary Neville wearing a black armband in honor of the Hillsborough victims during a match in 2004.
United and Liverpool have both enjoyed success in the European Cup, now known as the Champions League. In the 1999 final, United stunned the footballing world by scoring twice in injury time to beat Bayern Munich 2-1 and complete an historic league, FA Cup and Champions League treble.
Liverpool pulled off a shock of their own in 2005. At half-time against Italian giants AC Milan in Istanbul, Rafael Benitez's Liverpool found themselves 3-0 down. During an incredible second half, Liverpool scored three times before sealing a fifth European triumph when goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek saved Andriy Shevchenko's penalty in a shootout.
The rivalry between Manchester and Liverpool also spills over into areas of popular culture. Indie band Oasis are arguably Manchester's most famous musical export. Brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher are, however, Manchester City fans.
To this day, the music of the Beatles helps to put the city of Livepool on the map. "The Fab Four" of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison were global megastars between 1960 and 1970.
By winning the Premier League title at the end of the 2010-11 season, Manchester United became English champions for a record 19th time -- overhauling Liverpool's total of 18.
The rivalry between the two clubs reached new heights last season. Liverpool's Luis Suarez was handed an eight-match ban by the Football Association for racially abusive Manchester United's Patrice Evra. In the return fixture, Suarez refused Evra's hand in the pre-match handshake.

Liverpool vs. Manchester United: A rivalry in pictures
German Martin Kaymer milks the moment as his putt on the 18th green ensures Europe will retain the Ryder Cup. His defeat of Steve Stricker capped an improbable comeback, as the Europeans triumphed 14½-13½ despite trailing 10-4 at one stage on Saturday.
Justin Rose punches the air as he caps an unlikely comeback of his own, defeating Phil Mickelson on the 18th green after being one down with two to play. The American described his loss as one of the turning points of the 2012 Ryder Cup. Europe's victory echoed the 1999 Ryder Cup, where the U.S. also came from 10-6 down to win 14½ - 13½. The 'Battle of Brookline' was bathed in controversy as U.S. players stormed the 17th green in celebration at s crucial Justin Leonard putt. Golfing etiquette had been broken as Leonard's opponent, Jose Maria Olazabal, could still have squared their match. Jean Van de Velde (middle) looks bewildered as he reflects on his defeat in the 1999 British Open. The Frenchman blew a three-shot lead on the final hole, so forcing a play-off with Justin Leonard (right) and Scotland's Paul Lawrie (left) which the latter won to seal his first major, despite trailing Van de Velde by an enormous 10 strokes before the final round took place. Liverpool players celebrate with goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek (in black) after the English side completed their remarkable comeback against Italians AC Milan in the 2005 European Champions League final. Trailing 3-0 at half time, Liverpool scored three goals in six second half minutes in Istanbul to force extra time and a penalty shoot-out, which they won 3-2. Players and fans of Manchester City celebrate after winning their first English title since 1968. City trailed Queens Park Rangers 2-1 but scored two stoppage time goals to win 3-2 - and so deny city rivals Manchester United the title. The success echoed United's 1999 Champions League triumph in Barcelona, where they beat Bayern Munich 2-1 despite trailing after 90 minutes. Having won the last four gold medals, the Soviet Union were hot favourites to win ice hockey gold at the 1980 Winter Olympics. Few expected Team USA - made up of amateur and college players - to stop them but they defied the odds to beat the Soviets 4-3 in a semifinal which became known as 'The Miracle on Ice.' They went on to win gold against Finland in the final.
Despite being two sets and 5-1 down in his semifinal, Frenchman Henri Cochet managed to win the 1927 Wimbledon title. He stunned the world No. 1, American Bill TiIden, in the semis before repeating his escapology act in the final, trailing by two sets once more and surviving six match points before rallying to win in five sets for a third successive game.
It is the one-day cricket international that may never be equalled. Set a world record score of 435 to win in their allotted 50 overs, Graeme Smith's South Africa beat Australia in Johannesburg after racking up 438 runs, with just one wicket and one ball to spare.
It is baseball's greatest fairytale comeback. In August 2001, the Seattle Mariners were on their way to equalling the major league record of 116 victories in a season. They led the lowly Cleveland Indians 14-2 at the halfway stage and though the Indians rallied they still needed five full runs with only one out remaining - and got them to win 15-14 in the 11th innings, with Kenny Lofton grabbing the crucial score.

The greatest sporting comebacks
"To start of piece of sculpture is almost like researching for a book, you have to get to know the person very well.
"It's an amalgam of everything I've seen of him and the meetings I've had with him. I've done him fairly pensive. He often stands on the edge of the pitch deciding on what's going to happen next. That's the moment I've chosen to record."
When capturing a character like Ferguson, how did Jackson select one stationary pose to epitomize a coach who is most often seen wildly gesticulating from the sidelines?
"I imagine him standing on the touchline in deep concentration, about to say something to the team which is going to change the tactics somewhat," he replied.
"One of the things he does is when the team has won or someone has scored a goal, he tends to put his hands in the air and wave them backwards and forwards.
"That's a very good pose for film, but it's not a good pose for sculpture as it makes him look like he's surrendering."
Ancient tradition
Sports stars have long been the subject of works of art, with the athletes of ancient Greece often honored with carvings and statues.
"Sports sculptures, the tradition goes back to Greco-Roman times," said Jackson.
"If you look at Greek sculpture, it's all of athletes or people who took part in the Games. It is carrying on a very long tradition."
There are practical advantages of depicting sportsmen for sculptors.
"They have generally come to a job through being young, athletic sportsmen," added Jackson.
"The theme of fitness continues throughout their life. It makes them easier to sculpt because their bodies are well proportioned."

The sculpture of Ferguson will be the latest in a long line of monuments proudly displayed by English football clubs.
Ferguson's fellow Scot Bill Shankly has a tribute outside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium for the three league titles he won for the club between 1964 and 1973.
Newcastle United unveiled a statue of much-loved former manager Bobby Robson earlier this year. Robson, England's coach during the 1990 World Cup, was a native of the north east and occupied the Newcastle hotseat for five years.

Battle over blame after horse meat found in beef products
From Josh Levs and Per Nyberg
updated 4:11 PM EST, Fri February 15, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Six big French retailers pull lasagne and other products
Comigel CEO tells a French news agency his company was "fooled" Findus Nordic CEO calls Comigel "the villain"
Horsemeat isn't a health hazard, but could contain a veterinary drug unsafe for humans
(CNN) -- High-stakes lawsuits, overlapping investigations and a bitter battle over blame are spreading across Europe in the wake of a scandal that has rocked the meat industry.
Horse meat was discovered in products that are supposed to be 100% beef, sold in Sweden, the United Kingdom and France.
On Sunday, a major company under scrutiny called one of its suppliers a "villain" responsible for the fraud. The supplier, in turn, insisted it was "fooled" by a subsupplier.
While authorities say there is no immediate cause for health concerns, the discovery was a new shock to an industry already reeling from a bombshell last month when Irish investigators found horse and pig DNA in numerous hamburger products.
The blame chain
Europe deals with horse meat scandal
Swedish food producer Findus has been a focus of the uproar since it announced Thursday that it had withdrawn its lasagna from stores as a precaution. The products were pulled Monday after French supplier Comigel raised concerns about the type of meat that was used, Findus Sweden said.
Findus said a letter from Comigel dated February 2 informed Findus that the contamination may date back to August 2012.
Horsemeat found in hamburgers in Britain and Ireland
Findus is only one of several companies that receive products from Comigel. Others include Axfood, Coop and ICA, which have recalled some meat products in Sweden, and Aldi, which has pulled some products from shelves in Britain.
Six big French retailers -- Auchan, Casino, Carrefour, Cora, Picard and Monoprix -- said Sunday that they were recalling lasagne and other products.
Findus Nordic, which oversees Findus throughout the Nordic region, said it has begun legal action against Comigel and its subsuppliers.
"We are only at the beginning of our legal process. Comigel will end up in a lot of legal processes going forward, I imagine," Findus Nordic CEO Jari Latvanen said Sunday in an interview with CNN. "Comigel is the villain."
Comigel has not responded to CNN's requests for comment. The company did not answer its phones when CNN called repeatedly, and did not respond to an e-mail request for comment. Neither did CEO Erick Lehagre.
But Lehagre told French news agency Agence France-Presse on Sunday that his company had been "fooled" by a French supplier. "We were victims," he said, according to AFP.
Comigel apparently took its website down, posting a sign that it is "under construction." Previously, the site described the company as offering a wide array of products through partners, including major European retailers.
Criss-crossing investigations
Probes are under way in France, Sweden, and Britain. The supply chain being studied includes still more countries.
France's consumer affairs minister, Benoit Hamon, ordered an immediate investigation and said results will be available by midweek.
In a statement, Hamon said a provider in Luxembourg and traders in Cyprus and the Netherlands are part of the chain being probed.
The Swedish National Food Agency announced Sunday that it is reporting Findus to police, which is the standard course of action when products have been sold with the wrong labels.
British police are investigating as well.
British officials held an emergency meeting Saturday in London. Participants agreed "meaningful results" must be achieved by Friday, UK Food Standards Agency spokesman Brad Smythe said.
Officials discussed what tests are possible, what laboratory capacity is needed, and what can be done to protect consumer confidence, he said.
The evidence so far suggests "either criminal activity or gross negligence," Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said, adding that "more bad news" could come.
UK food businesses have been ordered to test all processed beef products for authenticity and report back to the authorities by Friday.
"I am determined that we get to the bottom of this and that any wrongdoing discovered is punished," Paterson said in a statement.
Prime Minister David Cameron weighed in Friday on Twitter. "This is completely unacceptable -- this isn't about food safety but about proper food labeling and confidence in retailers," he wrote.
Legal action under way
Latvanen credits his company with uncovering "a serious case of fraud."
"What has happened with Comigel is a crime, a scandal," he said in an interview with CNN.
Burger King finds horse meat at European supplier
While Findus has begun legal action in Sweden, Findus France previously said it will file a legal complaint Monday against a Romanian business that is part of the supply chain. It did not name the business publicly.
"There are two victims in this affair: Findus and the consumer," Findus France said in a statement.
The British arm of Findus said it is considering legal action against suppliers as well. Early results of an internal investigation "strongly suggest" the horse meat contamination of a beef lasagna product "was not accidental," the company said.
Tests showed up to 100% horse meat
Aldi said tests on random samples demonstrated that the withdrawn products contained between 30% and 100% horse meat.
"This is completely unacceptable and like other affected companies, we feel angry and let down by our supplier. If the label says beef, our customers expect it to be beef."
Samples of the affected Findus lasagna contained between 60% and 100% horse meat, according to UK and Irish food safety inspectors.
In January, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland found that 10 out of 27 hamburger products it analyzed in a study contained horse DNA, while 23 of them -- or 85% -- tested positive for pig DNA.
In nine out of the 10 burger samples, the horse DNA was found at very low levels, the inspectors said. But in one sample from Tesco, Britain's largest retailer, the horse meat accounted for about 29% of the burger.
Tesco apologized and vowed to make sure it never happens again.
Irish officials blamed ingredients from Poland.
Concerns about a veterinary drug
While horse meat is not itself a food safety hazard, food inspectors are concerned it may contain the veterinary drug phenylbutazone, or "bute," commonly used to treat horses.
Meat from animals treated with phenylbutazone may pose a risk to human health and is not allowed to enter the food chain as it may pose a risk to human health.
Findus has been ordered to test the lasagna withdrawn from shelves in the United Kingdom for the drug's presence.
The revelations have revolted many meat eaters in the United Kingdom, where horse meat is generally considered taboo, although it is commonly eaten in neighboring France, as well as countries including China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Italy.
The discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products. Jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horse meat.
The UK Justice Ministry confirmed last week that a number of meat pies and similar items supplied to prisons in England and Wales were labeled and served as halal -- prepared in compliance with Islamic dietary law -- but contained traces of pork DNA, the Food Standards Agency said.
Horse meat is not commonly eaten in the United States, but the country does export it to Canada and Mexico. Congress passed a bill in November 2011 that lifted a 5-year-old ban on the slaughter of horses for meat in the United States.

Doctors to Obama: Let us treat hunger-striking detainees at Guantanamo
By Chelsea J. Carter and Kevin Liptak, CNN
updated 10:14 AM EDT, Wed June 19, 2013
Protresters demanding the closing of the Guantanamo detention facility and the end of the ongoing hunger strike by 103 of the inmates stand outside the White House in Washington on May 24, 2013. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The Lancet medical journal published the open letter on Tuesday
The letter is signed by more than 150 doctors and medical professionals
They are asking the president to allow them to treat the hunger-striking detainees
Thirteen detainees wrote an open letter in May pleading for civilian doctors
(CNN) -- In an open letter to President Barack Obama published Tuesday, dozens of doctors asked to be allowed to treat hunger-striking prisoners at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
For four months, many detainees at Guantanamo have been on a hunger strike, protesting their detention at the facility.
"It is clear that they do not trust their military doctors," the more than 150 doctors and other medical professionals wrote in an open letter published online by The Lancet medical journal.
"They have very good reason for this, as you should know, from the current protocols of the Joint Task Force Guantanamo, which those doctors are ordered to follow."
Obama renews call to close Gitmo
Gitmo prisoners being force-fed
In May, 13 detainees wrote an open letter in the UK-based Guardian newspaper asking to see civilian doctors because they said they did not trust the military doctors whom they accused of force-feeding them against their will.
In their letter to Obama, the doctors and medical professionals said: "The orders they receive are ultimately your orders as their Commander-in-Chief. Without trust, safe and acceptable medical care of mentally competent patients is impossible. Since the detainees do not trust their military doctors, they are unlikely to comply with current medical advice."
Of the 166 detainees at Guantanamo, 104 are on a hunger strike to protest their treatment an indefinite detention, according to Capt. Robert Durand, a spokesman for the detention facility.
Forty-four of the detainees have received "enteral feeding," where a tube is inserted through the nose and down the throat to administer liquids, military officials said.
The detainee protest began last year, with five to six detainees starting and stopping hunger strikes. But the number grew after lawyers for some of those held drew attention to conditions at the facility, Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, a spokesman on detainee issues at the Pentagon, said earlier this year.
Human rights groups have long protested the detention of suspected enemy fighters who haven't been charged with crimes.
The government says the detainees are too dangerous to transfer but cannot be tried, characterizing them as war prisoners under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Act.
Obama has recently renewed his vow to shut the prison established last decade to house suspected terrorists.
The open letter from the doctors came a day after the federal government was forced to release the names of dozens of detainees at the military prison after a newspaper sued the federal government for the information.
The list released Monday identifies 46 inmates being held for "continued detention" at the facility. The report was made public after a lawsuit by the Miami Herald. The Obama administration first acknowledged that detainees were being held indefinitely in Guantanamo in 2010 but didn't make their identities public until now.
Of the 46 detainees listed for indefinite detention, the report shows that 26 are from Yemen, 10 are from Afghanistan, three are from Saudi Arabia, two each are from Libya and Kuwait, and one each are from Kenya, Somalia and Morocco.

Small plane makes forced landing on Bronx highway By Ray Sanchez. Sho Wills and Felicia Schwartz CNN

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Forced landing in the Bronx on major highway
3 people on board
No reports of any vehicles struck by the aircraft
New York (CNN) -- A small plane with apparent engine trouble made a forced landing Saturday on a busy highway in the Bronx, injuring three people, authorities said.
The 1966 Piper PA-28-180 aircraft landed about 3:20 p.m near the East 233rd Street exit on the Major Deegan Expressway, authorities said.
It appears the single-engine plane avoided cars on the normally busy highway that connects the Bronx with Westchester County, said police spokeswoman Annette Markowski.
The sight of a small plane on its belly near the snowy edge of the highway surprised passing motorists.

"It didn't look like it crashed or hit any cars," said Patricia Sapol, 29, who was driving south on the highway with her husband shortly after the landing. "It didn't look damaged in anyway. It was remarkable, to be quite honest."
She added, "We're like, Is this really happening? There's a plane on the highway. It was pretty neat. You don't see that every day."
Police said there were three people on board: the pilot and two passengers.
The three were were taken to St. Barnabas Hospital, fire department spokesman Frank Dwyer said.
A hospital spokesman, Steve Clark, said one man and two women were transported. Two refused treatment and a woman was treated for a minor head injury, he said. The three were to be discharged.
Fire officials initially said the three suffered serious injuries.
Images from the scene showed the small plane on the highway, surrounded by emergency vehicles and first responders.
There was no immediate information about damage to the aircraft or traffic on the highway at the time of the landing, authorities said.
The northbound lanes on the Major Deegan -- where the plane landed -- were closed until about 6 p.m., police said.
The plane is registered to a resident of Westchester County.
