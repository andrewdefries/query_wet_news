Review: Even Depp can't save clogged 'Pirates' Story Highlights• Johnny Depp brilliant again in new "Pirates of the Caribbean" • Movie has so much going on, however, hard to follow • Special effects great, plot falls apart By Tom Charity Special to CNN Adjust font size:
(CNN) -- It takes an age before Johnny Depp shows his face in "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," and when he does, it's the tip of his nose that looms into screen left, eventually succeeded by a flaring nostril.I doubt there's been a larger, longer close-up of a proboscis this side of "Seabiscuit," and there's no rhyme or reason for it, really. But our indulgence is rewarded when not one, not two, but an entire crew of digital Depps bounce into view, flouncing and flailing for all they are worth. One even lays an egg.Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, you may recall (spoiler!), bought a one-way ticket to Davy Jones's Locker when he went down with his ship at the end of the last film, "Dead Man's Chest." Not that death is a terminal condition in this series; before "At World's End" is through, most of the cast will have perished at least once and returned to the fray.For Sparrow, perdition is to be marooned on the Black Pearl in the middle of a desert without a whisper of a breeze. The doldrums. It's enough to drive a buccaneer to distraction.He's not the only one.The entire franchise seems on the verge of collapse, propelled to construct ever more grandiose flights of fancy. Without those sequences, there would be nothing there -- but a movie cannot exist on rollick alone (not by the second sequel anyway). I kept flashing to the image of a doomed mariner furiously bailing out his boat as it sinks inexorably beneath the waves.The problem is not so much that the energy -- or the invention -- flags. But the audience may. Screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have been working overtime. Having fabricated an entire supernatural pirate mythology from odds and ends (a theme park here, a Flying Dutchman there), they now feel duty-bound to lay it all out for us as they go.And the more that is explained, the murkier everything gets."World's End" features so many detailed negotiations between charlatans with obscure cross-purposes you head for the exit more confused than when you went in. Still, it's all as splashy as $250 million can buy, and on occasion the CGI guys conjure something akin to poetry: for example, a sampan gliding through a vast arctic cave, then emerging like a spaceship into an inky black sea reflecting the stars above ("You have to be lost to find a place that's never been found," rationalizes Capt. Barbossa, once again played by Geoffrey Rush).Or the Black Pearl surfing through the sand on the back of a million crustaceans. Or the climactic sea battle on the cusp of an oceanic whirlpool. Or its wonderful character creations, notably Davy Jones himself (again by the terrific Bill Nighy).We critics routinely shortchange such wonders, but blockbusters thrive on spectacle, and any movie that can produce a 50-foot woman almost as an afterthought has no worries on that score.At the same time, it's easier to warm to the vaudevillian Hope-and-Crosby-style comedy director Gore Verbinski keeps trying to smuggle in under the radar, in dozens of throwaway sight gags, madcap verbal non-sequiturs, and slapstick set pieces. Depp is his principal ally, of course, the agent of chaos swanning his way through the heart of the whole shebang.It's really too bad this wonderful anarchy is swamped by the movie's noisy inconsequence. Fully an hour too long -- 2 3/4 hours! -- and emotionally frigid, "Pirates" is scuppered by nothing so much as its own inflated self-importance."Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" runs 168 minutes and is rated PG-13.

What makes a viral ad?Story Highlights Raging debate on whether clip is real or computer-edited drives viewers to watch Do a video contest, because everyone else is Virals can be more believable than the regular 30-second ads Next Article in World Business » From Colvyn Harris, CEO of JWT India, for CNN	(CNN) -- How do you create something that people want to spend more time with, and also want their groups of friends or social community to spend more time with? In this award-winning viral, a John West "spars" with a grizzly bear over a fish. The answer lies in the idea that it's "oh so viralicious," it's got to be shared -- with your friends and colleagues at the very first instance, at that second. And what will drive that is the power of that idea -- its creativity, its point of view, or sheer genius in expression. Take an idea that infects you with a compulsion to hit the forward button a second after you experience it. Start a viral chain reaction from one outbox to another. Virals are the measurable equivalent of the old-fashioned word-of-mouth, but the virus can't be controlled. Most often, if it's any good, it will exceed expectations on the Web. It's primary to think beyond the adaptation of a 60-second spot, because the online audience can smell an ad from a mile away. Obviously, it's got to be irreverent, weird, funny and different. But more importantly, the Web has the ability to make the viral event a dialogue and, in some cases, create a community around the very "viralicious" idea. At the cutting edge of building brands and selling products is the viral campaign. The short video clip, game, widget or ad is so compelling that much of an advertiser's work is done when their prospective customers forward it to their contacts and friends across various social networks, quickly building up an audience of millions at costs that will surprise every marketing budget planner. It could potentially drive the revenue out of traditional media as we know it. The various "hows" to inject that vital viral infection are listed here with a few examples: Viralicious #1: The Controversial Edge Forward: Hey guys check this out. Someone's had the guts to spray graffiti on the president's plane. Controversy is the mother of advertising. The edgiest ideas of them all can lead to massive attention and in fact become hot topics of debate on national television. Watch what happened to Mark Ecko with Droga 5. Having started several enterprises around the hip/hop, skater and style scene, Ecko decided to create an ideological statement on the First Amendment. He filmed a session of himself "tagging" Air Force One and used the following hype to explain why. Did he really spray graffiti on the president's plane? The Still Free campaign has generated several million blogs, questions and video views worldwide. The U.S. authorities and investigation agencies felt compelled to investigate whether it was "real." The controversial video was awarded the Grand Prix award in the Viral Marketing category at the Cannes Festival. Viralicious #2: Shock [I don't believe this] Value Forward: Hey, I don't believe Ronaldinho did this for real, but it looks real mate. The Nike Ronaldinho Touch of Gold "Crossbar" video: This clip is one of the most-watched virals ever, with more than 50 million views globally. Featuring world-famous soccer star Ronaldinho hitting the crossbar no less than four times, without the ball touching the floor. The product on display is the Nike R10 football boot. A massive discussion and raging debate on whether the clip was actually real or computer-edited drove millions of interested viewers to the campaign online and was the most forwarded video that year. Viralicious #3: Ignite the Community Forward: Hey, I've voted for my leader in the Lead India online/SMS poll . Have you voted yet? This idea aimed to ignite every young mind in the world's largest democracy to actually elect a leader based on his abilities and leadership skills, rather than vote for someone who's already a politician. Probably the first viral campaign with a serious purpose, this campaign shook the nation with a million blogsites; millions of views and downloads of the campaign videos; millions of online participants; and spread like wildfire across all media in a nation of a billion people. Don't Miss JWT's Bob Jeffrey on The Boardroom
This idea created several hundred communities that are still debating the novelty of this cause on Orkut and several other social networking sites. The audience embraced the idea and made it viral by continuing the conversation, and posting and reposting the various episodes of Lead India and the videos online across video sites and blogspots. This is one big idea that created its own popular culture. Viralicious #4: D.I.Y Online Contests Forward: Hey, I watched this video and ripped a phonebook with my bare hands. Can you beat that? There have been plenty of online video contests, but the Sulekha.com R.I.P Yellow Pages Challenge is already the most responded contest of all time on YouTube with over 3,000 user-generated video responses, each one trying to out-rip the other with thicker phonebooks and faster rips. In fact, there's Ed Shelton, the Guinness world-record holder for the most number of phone book rips in two minutes; ripping his own world record. Other contests that are a rage in the viral arena are the Mentos Geyser Contest and the BarterBee's Contest. Do a video contest, because everyone else is. This online-video "contest bug" will continue, and it will become more difficult to activate consumers to promote your product. In the case of Sulekha.com, the contest idea of ripping yellow pages as a show of strength online has created a community of rippers across various networks who work underground to rip and recycle yellow pages, and therefore promote the paperless Sulekha.com online yellow pages. Viralicious #4: Laugh Out Loud Forward: Hey I couldn't stop laffing after this, truly LOL, enjoy :) Every once in a while, we see an ad that actually becomes LOL content for the same or a completely different audience. In this case, a John West employee fights a grizzly bear off to land a fish -- just to go that extra mile for quality. Obviously, it is set up, with costumes that look surprisingly real, until the bear starts throwing kung fu tricks at the "fisherman." An unusual viral, it created more than 300 million views and has won 10 awards, including "Best Commercial of the Year" from British Television Advertising Awards and a Gold Lion at the Cannes Lions Festival. Viralicious #5: Topless celebrities/wardrobe malfunctions/accidental nudity Forward: Hey, have you seen Kylie ride a bucking bronco in her underwear? Really sexy. Kylie Minogue rides a velvet bucking bronco wearing nothing but lingerie from Agent Provocateur. This video was originally meant for a cinema audience, but, after being judged too explicit, it went viral and started spreading aggressively throughout the Internet. The video is completely in harmony with the Agent Provocateur corporate vision to provoke and create controversy, which it most definitely did, with more than 360 million views -- and still counting -- more than five years after its release. Marketers have embraced this emerging media and are increasingly weaving viral components into their marketing plans. Guess what's really working for the "very viralicious" idea is the fact that it can be more believable than the regular 30-second ads. And always at the center is an idea, an expression, that captures one's imagination.

Killing shows Mexico clergy no longer cloaked from cartels' aimStory Highlights Priest's murder crosses a line, says Manuel Corral of Mexico's Council of Bishops Of 15,000 priests in Mexico, 1,000 have been threatened by traffickers, Corral says Clergy have long denounced drug world, but now have become targets themselvesNext Article in World » By Mariano Castillo CNN	(CNN) -- The killing last weekend of a Catholic priest and two seminary students in southwest Mexico marked the first time that drug cartel hit men have purposefully targeted a clergyman, said Manuel Corral, public relations secretary for Mexico's Council of Bishops. The Rev. Habacuc Hernandez Benitez, 39, was gunned down as he traveled in a vehicle in the town of Arcelia in the state of Guerrero, together with two seminary students, Eduardo Oregon Benitez, 19, and Silvestre Gonzalez Cambron, 21. "In this case the drug traffickers followed them and ambushed them," said Corral, who declined to name which cartel is suspected behind the incident. Authorities have not stated a motive in the case, but Corral said one line of investigation is that one of the seminary students had a family member involved with a drug cartel, and that the three were killed as revenge for some cause. At least seven priests have been killed in Mexico since 2005 under violent circumstances, including being kidnapped, shot and beaten. Organized crime has been suspected in some of these cases, but Saturday's killing in Guerrero left no doubt of the perpetrators' business, Corral said. Hernandez and the two seminarians had just celebrated Mass in Arcelia and were leaving the area when a group of unknown gunmen pulled up next to their vehicle and opened fire, according to the local human rights organization Montana Tlachinollan. Local reports added that after shooting the priest's vehicle, the gunmen pulled the men outside and shot them in the back. The incident paralyzed area residents to the point that no one in the town would go to identify the bodies, Montana Tlachinollan reported. The three victims remained "unknown" until someone from out of town came to officially identify them. Don't Miss U.S. may help train Mexican customs agents under pact

Since taking office in 2006, Mexican President Felipe Calderon has made the fight against drug cartels a priority. He has dispatched more than 25,000 troops to augment local police forces. Last year, drug violence was blamed for the deaths of 78 Mexican soldiers and more than 6,000 others. This year, the drug violence has claimed more than 2,900 lives, according to the newspaper El Universal. The clergy has not been spared from the spike in drug-related violence that has afflicted regions of Mexico, Corral said. "The threats are not new," he said. "As drug trafficking continued to grow, from about 2004 on, the priests continued to denounce it, and they themselves were threatened." In April, the archbishop of the northern state of Durango raised fears of attacks on the clergy after he said that Mexico's most wanted man, Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, lives in a Durango town and that "everybody knows it except the authorities." The comment, which was made in private conversation, stirred fears of retaliation and the archbishop backed off his statement after it quickly spread. Of the 15,000 priests in Mexico, Corral estimated that 1,000 had been threatened in some form, and that 300 priests have been threatened directly. Those direct threats -- usually in the form of "shut up, or we'll shut you up" -- have come from intermediaries for organized crime or anonymously, Corral said. The threats against the clergy have been serious enough that in some 20 cases, priests in Mexico were transferred to other parishes out of regard for their safety, he said. The targeting of a priest is significant because it marks another boundary crossed by drug cartels, Corral said. Bishops have noted that in surveys they conduct with families in their dioceses, drug dealing and domestic drug use top the list of problems families face, whereas three or five years ago it didn't make the list. As enforcement action in Mexico and the United States has increased, domestic drug consumption in Mexico has increased. Domestic drug use has torn families apart and made the new generation of traffickers more violent and less respectful of institutions like the church, Corral said. But these same traffickers who threaten priests are paradoxically the same people that the church wants to reach. "Rebuilding the social fabric has been a mission of the church," Corral said. "We can't live in fear." Another notable killing, the 1993 murder of Guadalajara Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, has been attributed by some as a case of mistaken identity by drug traffickers, though church officials have publicly expressed doubts that the killers were traffickers. The state of Guerrero, known for its beach destination of Acapulco, in recent years has been the setting of turf wars over drug trafficking routes between the Gulf cartel, the Sinaloa cartel, and an organization known as La Familia.

Moussavi website: Tear gas fired to disperse Iran protesters By the CNN Wire Staff Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: Police used tear gas on protesters Tuesday in Tehran says opposition website. STORY HIGHLIGHTSProtests called for International Women's DayThere was a large security presence on squares across TehranOpposition to the ruling clerics has simmered since '09 election

Government of Iran
(CNN) -- Security forces in Iran's capital used tear gas to disperse protesters near Revolution Square Tuesday, according to the website of opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi. Iran's opposition movement called for demonstrations to mark International Women's Day, and the security presence and car honking was widespread throughout Tehran. Thousands of Basij security forces were patrolling Revolution Square and other major squares and intersections in Tehran Tuesday. Cars honked in an apparent show of protest and security agents ripped off the license plate of a car that was honking. The driver apologized and the plate was returned. Two young women in a car said something to several members of the Basij. The agents took out cell phones and photographed their license plate before they drove off. Opposition to the ruling clerics has simmered since the 2009 election, when hundreds of thousands of people filled Tehran streets to denounce President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election as fraudulent. Iranian authorities began rounding up many government opponents in February amid calls for protests like those that have swept across North Africa and the Middle East.

U.S. declines Pakistani radical's offer to help Sandy victims
From Saima Mohsin, for CNN
updated 5:46 PM EDT, Wed October 31, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: United States declines offer of aid from Hafiz Mohammad Saeed
U.S. government had offered $10 million for information leading to his capture
He is accused of involvement in the Mumbai attacks in 2008
He denies the allegations and says the Pakistani courts have cleared him
Read a version of this story in Arabic here
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- As residents of the U.S. Northeast grapple with the destruction wrought by Superstorm Sandy, an offer of assistance has come from an unlikely quarter: the leader of a radical Muslim group in Pakistan that Washington has branded a terrorist group.
"We offer our unconditional support and help for the victims" of the storm, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, head of the Islamic charity Jamaat-ud-Dawa, said in a statement late Tuesday. "If U.S. government allows, we will send our doctors, relief and rescue experts, food and medicine on humanitarian grounds."
India accuses Saeed of masterminding the 2008 terrorist assault on Mumbai that killed 166 people -- an allegation he denies.
The United States, which has declared Jamaat-ud-Dawa a terrorist organization and put up a $10 million reward for information leading to Saeed's arrest and conviction, declined the offer.
"While we have great respect for Islamic tradition of social assistance to those who are in need no matter where they might be, this particular offer strikes us as very hollow," State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Wednesday.
Is Sandy a taste of things to come?
Saeed said in the statement posted on Jamaat-ud-Dawa's Facebook page Tuesday that despite the bounty and U.S. allegations about his organization, helping Americans struck by adversity is "our religious and moral obligation."

Photos: Sandy's destructive path

Crane continues to dangle above midtown
"Islam orders us to help them without discriminating between religion, cast or creed," he said in the statement, which was set against the backdrop of an apparently fabricated image of a scuba diver swimming through a submerged Times Square subway station.
His organization said on its Twitter account that it had previously carried out relief efforts following natural disasters in Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
Sandy's impact: State by state
The "wanted" notice for Saeed issued by the State Department's Rewards for Justice program in April described him as a former professor of Arabic and engineering who helped found Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which aims to bring about Islamist rule in India and Pakistan.
The group's military wing, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which means army of the pure, is blamed for violence in the disputed territory of Kashmir aimed at liberating Muslims.
After the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba began operating outside Kashmir. It is suspected of carrying out several high-profile attacks in India in the past few years.
How you can help storm victims
The United States labeled it a "foreign terrorist organization" in December 2001, and under pressure from Washington, Pakistan banned it in 2002. But the group continues to function freely.
After the U.S. government announced the reward for his capture in April, Saeed appeared on Pakistani television and seemed unruffled by the move.
"I am living my life in the open and the U.S. can contact me whenever they want," he said.
Saeed said the Pakistani Supreme Court had cleared him and his organization of wrongdoing in relation to the Mumbai attacks in which gunmen stormed locations throughout Mumbai, killing scores of people and taking hostages. Six American citizens were killed in the carnage.
"The U.S. government is listening to the Indian lobby and not making its own decisions," Saeed said regarding the allegations against him. He condemned the Mumbai attacks.
Pakistani authorities have refused to take him into custody, saying they haven't received "concrete evidence" against him.
The Indian government has issued a notice with Interpol against Saeed in relation to his alleged role in the attacks. India accuses him of participating in the training of the gunmen in the Mumbai attack and has charged him in absentia.
Saeed has not been indicted in the United States, but the Treasury Department designated him and three other Lashkar-e-Tayyiba leaders as terrorists in 2008. It froze their assets in the United States and prohibited Americans from doing any business with them.

'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey': Your unexpected questions answered
By Jennifer Vineyard, Special to CNN
updated 12:25 PM EST, Tue December 18, 2012
Dean O'Gorman, left, and Aidan Turner are among the dwarves in "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey."
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"The Hobbit" has to play catch-up with what we're presumed to know
Even if you read "The Hobbit," some parts of the new film could raise questions
In "The Lord of the Rings" films, there's one main dwarf, but "The Hobbit" has 13
Those who remember "The Lord of the Rings" will recall Elrond's foster child was Aragorn
(CNN) -- Now that you've watched "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," you may have some unexpected questions.
Even if you read the book long ago or quite recently, some material was not from "The Hobbit" proper, but from the appendixes to "The Lord of the Rings," which helped connect the stories. Of course, we had the benefit of seeing "The Lord of the Rings" films first. Despite being a prequel, "The Hobbit" has to play catch-up with what we're presumed to know -- that there exists a Ring of Power that Sauron has lost and Gollum has found/stolen, which Bilbo finds/steals during a detour on a separate adventure.
This is the main connective tissue -- the Ring itself -- but since everything else can get confusing pretty quickly, we'll try to sort out some of the pressing matters for you.
How do you tell the dwarves apart?
In "The Lord of the Rings," films, we had one main dwarf -- Gimli, played by John Rhys-Davies. In "The Hobbit," we have 13. The tallest one (and the leader, with the most lines) is Thorin Oakenshield, played by Richard Armitage. After that, it gets a bit harder. If the dwarf is bald, that's Dwalin, the first to arrive at Bilbo's home.

If the dwarf is older with a white beard, that's his brother Balin (whose tomb you visit in "The Fellowship of the Ring" in the Mines of Moria scene). If the Dwarf looks like Gimli, that's Gloin, Gimli's father, who was present during the Council of Elrond scene in "Fellowship." If the dwarf is older with a gray beard, he's either Dori (chin-strap beard) or Oin (no chin-strap beard) -- unless he has also has an ax in his head, which would make him Bifur. Bifur doesn't speak much, because of the whole ax-in-the-head thing.
If the dwarf wears a hat and has an Irish accent, that's Bofur. If the dwarf is fat, providing comic relief, and has an extreme beard (compared to the others), that's Bofur's brother Bombur -- they're both cousins of Bifur.
Of the youngest dwarves, there are two subsets -- the ones who are hot (Fili the blond and Kili the brown-haired one) and the ones who are not (Nori with three braids and Ori with a perpetually perplexed look on his face -- both younger brothers of Dori). Ori, by the way, is the one who wrote about Balin's death in the book found in the Mines of Moria, so he's a bit of a historian.
Five things changed/expanded from the book for 'The Hobbit' films
Why is Gandalf so eager for Bilbo to risk his life?
Gandalf tricks Bilbo into "advertising" as a burglar by putting a rune on his door to indicate his availability to help the dwarves retrieve some gold from the dragon Smaug. But why would a wizard of Gandalf's stature care whether the dwarves got their gold -- and their homeland -- back or not?
Because he doesn't want Sauron, now known as the Necromancer, to have access to Smaug, and so killing the dragon is their common goal.
In scenes from the appendixes that might be depicted in the upcoming "Hobbit" films, Gandalf has run-ins with Thrain (Thorin's dad, who gives him a map and key to Erebor before he dies) and then with Thorin himself, en route to the Shire.
According to the appendixes, Gandalf knew that Sauron was plotting war and intended to attack Rivendell. What was to stop him? "Only the Dwarves of the Iron Hills. And beyond them lay the desolation of the Dragon. The Dragon Sauron might use with terrible effect. How then could the end of Smaug be achieved?" So Gandalf convinced Thorin that they could be of use to each other, and that a Hobbit could be of help, considering his scent would be unfamiliar to the Dragon.
'The Hobbit' breaks December record with $84.8 million weekend
How come Gandalf doesn't do more? How many wizards are there anyway?
The wizards, or Istari, were apparently sent to Middle-earth "to contest the power of Sauron, and to unite all those who had the will to resist him." But they were forbidden to confront him directly, according to the appendixes. So while Gandalf could face off against a Balrog in "Fellowship," or the Mouth of Sauron in "Return of the King," he can't go mano-a-mano with Sauron.
Gandalf, as we know from "The Lord of the Rings," isn't the only wizard in Middle-earth, and in "The Hobbit," we meet a new one: Radagast the Brown.
So is there a wizard for every color of the rainbow? No -- but there are at least five and maybe as many as seven. We've now met three. (Tolkien mentioned two others, Alatar and Pallando, both Blue in his notes).
And Radagast's role has already been inflated from the books. (In "Fellowship," Gandalf tells of Radagast's warning about the Ringwraiths, and how Saruman mocked the Brown wizard as "Radagast the Bird-tamer! Radagast the Simple! Radagast the Fool!" so at least that's intact).
Why don't we see Aragorn?
We get some familiar characters in the Rivendell scene, such as Galadriel and Saruman, who join Elrond and Gandalf for the White Council confab. But those who remember "The Lord of the Rings" will recall that Elrond's foster child at the time was Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), son of Arathorn and heir of Isildur. As a child, he was called Estel, meaning Hope, and his true name and heritage were kept a secret.
But if the events in "The Hobbit" take place as written in the books, with Aragorn born in the year 2931, and Gandalf, Bilbo and the dwarves visiting Rivendell in 2941, he would be about 10 years old. Sixty years pass, and then Bilbo has his 111th birthday party.
"The Lord of the Rings" films, however, condense the timeline between Bilbo's birthday in 3001 and Frodo's quest in 3018, at which point, the long-living Aragorn is supposed to be 87.
Given this flexibility, Aragorn could have been depicted as either a child or a grown man in "The Hobbit." Maybe this passage in the appendixes explains where he is right now: "When Estel was only twenty years of age, it chanced that he returned to Rivendell after great deeds in the company of the sons of Elrond." So he's away, doing great deeds. With any luck, we'll get to hear about those in later films.
Has Gollum ever had a girlfriend?
No.

Sandy Hook students return to class for first time since Newtown shooting

The gunman shot his mother before killing 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary
(CNN) -- For the first time since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Christine Wilford plans do something remarkable on Thursday that once was routine: drop her child off at school.
The last time her 7-year-old son, Richie, was in class was on December 14, when a gunman smashed his way into his school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 children and adults.
As shots rang out, Richie's teacher locked the door and huddled her students into the corner as the shooter roamed the hallways, wielding an AR-15 assault rifle and firing.
When it appeared safe, the children were then hurried away to a nearby fire station, where teary parents either reunited with their sons and daughters or learned that they had been killed.

Reaction to Newtown school killings
Principal's daughter: She'll be with them
Source says Lanza cut dad out of his life
Sandy Hook: Obama's worst day Nearly a month later, Wilford said her son still has trouble sleeping and is often scared by loud noises.
Newtown chooses faith, charity, hope
But on Thursday, he will join hundreds of other Newtown students returning to class for the first time since the tragedy.
"We think it's good he's going back," Wilford said. "If I leave my child anywhere, I'm leaving a piece of my heart, so it's difficult to leave him."
'I think I'll be OK,' Sandy Hook student says after first day
But Richie apparently isn't afraid and says he's looking forward to seeing his friends, she said.
They won't be attending Sandy Hook Elementary, which police say remains part of an ongoing investigation into Adam Lanza, the gunman who also killed his mother before opening fire at the school.
Instead, Richie and his classmates are expected to travel to Chalk Hill Middle School in the nearby town of Monroe, where a green-and-white banner greeting the children hangs on a fence.
Survivor's attorney withdraws lawsuit
I think right now it has to be the safest school in America.Monroe Police Lt. Keith White Newtown Public Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson said that part of the building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school.
"(We want) to have as much (of) a normal routine as possible," she said. "(Thursday) is a regular schedule, and we will do the kinds of things that we know are good for kids."
The school has also been outfitted with rugs and furniture similar to those at Sandy Hook to help ease the transition for students. Even the school's pet turtle was relocated, Robinson said.
Security measures have also been increased, with a new system incorporating more cameras and locks, according to Jim Agostine, superintendent of Monroe Public Schools.
"I think right now it has to be the safest school in America," Monroe Police Lt. Keith White said.

Teens accused of posting pictures of sexual assault
By Mariano Castillo, CNN
updated 5:13 PM EDT, Mon April 15, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Three teenage boys were arrested Thursday; they face charges of sexual battery
The girl who allegedly was attacked took her own life last year
The boys are accused of sharing photos of the attack and posting them online
(CNN) -- Three teenage California boys are facing charges of sexual battery in connection with the alleged rape of a girl who subsequently committed suicide, authorities said.
The incident happened at an unsupervised house party in Saratoga, California, in September, but the three 16-year-olds were arrested Thursday, said Santa Clara Sheriff's Office spokesman Jose Cardoza.
When evidence goes viral
The case is similar to one that played out in court this year in Steubenville, Ohio, where two star football players were convicted of rape for assaulting a girl who had too much to drink. Images in that case were posted on social media sites.
Teen before suicide: 'My life is over'
Cyberbullying blamed in teen suicides
In the California case, Santa Clara County Sheriff's detectives say Audrie Pott had too much to drink at a party and passed out. That's when the boys are accused of attacking her.
How to help and support young rape victims
The boys are accused of taking photos of the attack and sharing them at school, as well as texting them and posting them online.
After learning that photos had been posted on the Internet, the 15-year-old Potts wrote in an online post that her life was ruined. She took her own life a few days later.
"What happened to Audrie was tragic. It should never have happened," Lauren Cerri, the Pott family attorney, told CNN affiliate KGO. "She had no idea what occurred until she woke up the following morning and had some drawings on her body and in some private areas."
The three unidentified boys face two felony and one misdemeanor charge of sexual battery, Cardoza said. Formal charges will come next week.
Rape accusations, teens and Twitter attacks in another U.S. town
A fellow student told KGO that along with the shock of Pott's death was the chatter of who was involved and how they remained in school.
"That it took that long (for an arrest) was pretty ridiculous," Samir Ingle told KGO. "It was maybe half a year. I find that really, really disturbing."
In the Steubenville case, Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl who had had too much to drink.
That trial that gained media attention for its lurid text messages, cell phone pictures and videos, and social media posts surrounding the sexual abuse of the girl.

The singer was there to lead the stadium in the national anthem, but instead of "The Star-Spangled Banner," he began singing "America the Beautiful." He's not the only star who's been caught in an awkward patriotic moment:
Comedian Roseanne Barr's disastrous rendition of the national anthem during a San Diego Padres game in July 1990 drew almost unanimous boos. In a 2012 interview, Barr told CNN's Piers Morgan it was "a huge regret that was hard to come back from."
But Whitney Houston hit the right notes at Super Bowl XXV in January 1991, stirring Americans' patriotic feelings during the Persian Gulf War. Her version of "The Star-Spangled Banner" reached the Billboard chart's Top 20 that year.
No stranger to performing the national anthem, Christina Aguilera nevertheless forgot some of the words when she did the song at Super Bowl XLV in February 2011. "I got so lost in the moment of the song that I lost my place," Aguilera told CNN. Cyndi Lauper becomes another singer to flub the national anthem when she performs at the U.S. Open tennis tournament around the 10-year anniversary of 9/11. "The moon shone done on us and I tried to say a prayer at the same time.. I hope I didn't mess up too bad. I wanted it to be comforting," she tweeted afterward. Beyoncé wows the nation with a rendition on Inauguration Day in January. The singer later told reporters "she decided to sing along with my prerecorded track," a decision she made in part because she didn't have time to rehearse with the U.S. Marine Band and had had "no proper sound check." But she wowed any doubters in her rehearsals and halftime show at the Super Bowl in February.
Marvin Gaye, pictured in 1984, sang a memorable but untraditional version during the 1983 NBA All-Star Game.
Luke Bryan was so nervous about becoming one of the stars famous for messing up the national anthem, he wrote a few lyrics on his palm before singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at a baseball game in July 2012 -- and was swiftly called out for it. "I had a few key words written down to ensure myself that I wouldn't mess up," Bryan later explained. "I just wanted to do my best. I promise it was from the heart. If I offended anyone with my approach I sincerely apologize. Anytime I sing the anthem it is an honor and my heart beats out of my chest."
Canadian singer Alexis Normand made headlines when she forgot the words to "The Star-Spangled Banner" at a hockey game in May. Normand, pictured perfoming at a later game, tweeted she was sorry.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
James Taylor messed up his national anthem performance He began singing "America the Beautiful" instead of "The Star-Spangled Banner"
The singer quickly and smoothly recovered
(CNN) -- All future singers of the national anthem should pay close attention to James Taylor's performance at Game 2 of the World Series on October 24.
If you're going to make a mistake, this is the way to make it.
On Thursday, the musician was at Fenway Park in Boston to lead the stadium in a rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner." But when he opened his mouth to sing, the words of "America the Beautiful" started pouring out.
James Taylor talks World Series
Rather than "Oh, say can you see," Taylor kicked off the song with, "Oh, beautiful ..."
But the singer quickly -- and rather smoothly -- recovered, going straight into the correct lyrics without missing a beat.
While other singers have caught major flak for messing up the words to the national anthem at such events, Taylor did have an excuse: he was also performing "America the Beautiful" that same night during the seventh inning stretch.
He was joined by several survivos of April's Boston Marathon attack.

Tributes and Information
Charles Henry Karczewski, Chuck as we knew him, was a loving husband, son, brother, godfather and honored friend. He was my dearest friend, a brother in my heart, a unique and genuine person. He wanted only for others to enjoy life with him. His character was that of a mature thoughtfulness with just enough innocence. His desire to learn and try new things was indeed infectious. Chuck possessed this wonderful quality of making all who met him feel comfortable in his presence. There was no pretense. He commanded a rare and wise soul. An emotional wound was opened that will be difficult to heal in the absence of this kind and noble gentleman. We will miss him, but we will never forget him.
James Wiggins, friend
