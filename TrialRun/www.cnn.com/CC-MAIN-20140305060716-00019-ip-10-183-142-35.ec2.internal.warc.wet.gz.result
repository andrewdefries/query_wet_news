LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters) -- Three days after a Princeton graduate student posted a paper on his Web site detailing how to defeat the copy-protection software on a new music CD by pressing a single computer key, the maker of the software said Thursday it would sue him.
In a statement, SunnComm Technologies Inc. said it would sue Alex Halderman over the paper, which said SunnComm's MediaMax CD-3 software could be blocked by holding down the "Shift" key on a computer keyboard as a CD using the software was inserted into a disc drive.
"SunnComm believes that by making erroneous assumptions in putting together his critical review of the MediaMax CD-3 technology, Halderman came to false conclusions concerning the robustness and efficacy of SunnComm's MediaMax technology," it said.
SunnComm, which trades on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, said it has lost more than $10 million of its market value since Halderman published his report.
The software was used on a CD, Anthony Hamilton's "Comin' From Where I'm From," released last month. Halderman, who has done research in the past on other CD protection technologies, said the software could also be disabled by stopping a driver the software loads on the computer when the CD is played.
SunnComm alleged Halderman violated criminal provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in disclosing the existence of those driver files.
Halderman -- who received an undergraduate degree from Princeton earlier this year and is now pursuing a doctorate in computer science with an emphasis on computer security -- said he had not yet heard directly from SunnComm in regards to litigation but was unconcerned.
"I'm still not very worried about litigation under the DMCA, I don't think there's any case," he told Reuters. "I don't think telling people to press the 'Shift' key is a violation of the DMCA."
A spokesman for BMG, the unit of Bertelsmann AG that licensed SunnComm's software and released the Hamilton CD, declined to comment on the planned suit.
The music industry, claiming a sharp decline in CD sales is the result of digital piracy through online file-sharing services, has worked to develop methods to secure music on discs and restrict its copying.
Halderman's graduate advisor at Princeton is Ed Felten, a computer science professor who once sued the Recording Industry Association of America in a challenge to the constitutionality of the DMCA.
The RIAA had threatened action under the DMCA against Felten and colleagues after they said they would publish a paper disclosing flaws in an industry security initiative. That suit was eventually dismissed.

Washington (CNN) -- Diane Wilson, arrested during a Senate hearing on the Gulf oil spill, protested again Saturday outside a BP gas station in Washington. She and more than a dozen other protesters chanted "boycott BP" while a man dressed as the Grim Reaper poured chocolate syrup over an inflatable planet Earth to symbolize the oil destruction. "I think this country needs to get behind the Gulf Coast. We are all in this together," Wilson told CNN. "It is like a body. If you got your foot being amputated, by gosh the rest of the body better take notice or we are all going to go down," said Wilson. She was arrested Wednesday after dumping fake oil on herself during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on the spill. She was in the audience when she began her protest and she was removed from the hearing room. "After doing this for 21 years, being nice, writing a letter, sitting down and talking to your congressman doesn't hack it," said Wilson, a fourth-generation shrimper from the Texas Gulf Coast. "You have to go out and do these outrageous actions." Saturday's protest drew little response. Customers continued in and out of the BP gas station, and the station's lone employee on duty had no comment. There were no arrests.

NYPD commissioner's son investigated over rape allegations, source says
From Susan Candiotti, CNN
updated 4:29 PM EST, Thu January 26, 2012
Kelly is a co-anchor on "Good Day New York" on the local Fox station WNYW, and formerly co-anchored "FOX & Friends Weekend."
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: WNYW says Kelly has requested time off
Kelly's attorney met with the DA on Thursday, according to a source
The district attorney's office says it "will not confirm or deny an investigation"
Kelly is a co-anchor on "Good Day New York" on WNYW
New York (CNN) -- The lawyer for the son of New York's police commissioner met Thursday with the Manhattan district attorney amid allegations that the son raped a woman three months ago, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.
Another source with knowledge of the investigation, who declined to be named citing the sensitive nature of the probe, said the district attorney's office is handling the investigation of Greg Kelly, 43, because of the apparent conflict of interest with the New York Police Department.
Kelly, who has not been charged with a crime, is the son of Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.
District attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero said her office "will not confirm or deny an investigation."
According to The New York Times, which cited a law enforcement official, a woman and her sister reported the incident Tuesday night.
After the alleged attack, a man presumed to be the alleged victim's boyfriend sought out the elder Kelly at a public event, according to Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne.
The man said to the commissioner, "Your son's ruining my girlfriend's life,'" Browne said.
"Kelly asked, 'What do you mean by that?'" Browne added.
"But the person said there were too many people around, and so the commissioner told the man to write him a letter," Browne said.
It could not be confirmed whether that occurred.
Andrew Lankler said his client is "cooperating fully."
"We know that the district attorney's investigation will prove Mr. Kelly's innocence," Lankler added.
Kelly is a co-anchor on "Good Day New York" on the local Fox station WNYW, and formerly co-anchored "FOX & Friends Weekend."
Kelly did not anchor the Thursday morning show. WNYW reported that Kelly has requested time off following the allegation.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg also weighed in Thursday, saying that "everyone has a right to have their complaints investigated."
"I also point out that as far as I know, Greg Kelly has not been charged with anything ... so I don't know how that is going to turn out, but I think any questions you have are going to have to be addressed to the district attorney," he said.
Before his career in news, Kelly spent nine years as a fighter pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps.

Why Dean Martin's still so cool
By Bob Greene, CNN Contributor
updated 9:39 AM EDT, Sun April 8, 2012
Years after his death, Dean Martin's relaxing singing voice is still a presence on TV, in shopping malls and restaurants.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Bob Greene says the coolness of Dean Martin seamlessly crosses generations
He says the crooner's calm, cool delivery slows everything down Greene: Martin's ease on stage made audiences feel at ease too
Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose books include "Late Edition: A Love Story" and "And You Know You Should Be Glad: A True Story of Lifelong Friendship." (CNN) -- A few years ago a group of us were having dinner at a steakhouse, and among the people at the table were the terrific sports columnist Mike Downey and his wife, Gail Martin. The manager of the place came over to say hello; introductions were made.
At one point in the evening I was making my way to the men's room and ran into the manager again. I said to him, "That Gail Martin you met? I think you're probably familiar with her late father."
"Who was her dad?" the man said.
"His first name was Dean," I said.
Within minutes the taped music that had been playing in the restaurant stopped, and a new tape was substituted -- a Dean Martin tape. Any steakhouse worthy of the name has his music on hand.
There it was, coming out of the ceiling: "You're nobody till somebody loves you. ..."
And just the sound of it -- just that instantly recognizable deep tremolo of Martin's voice, so warm and easy and seemingly effortless -- had an effect on the room. It was as if someone had sprayed some kind of invisible muscle relaxant into the air. People visibly loosened up, they smiled a little more, it was like a friend had arrived and had said: Quit worrying about things. Life doesn't have to be so serious.
He's been gone for more than 16 years now -- he died on Christmas Day, 1995 -- yet he seems to get only bigger as the years go by. I've been noticing it in recent days: That voice keeps drifting out of radios, out of television sets, out of hidden speakers in malls and coffee shops and clothing stores ... it's as if his voice, and his face, have by some sort of silent national acclamation been voted the quasi-official antidote for tense times. In a lousy mood? That changes as soon as you hear: "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie. ..."
The coolness of Dean Martin seamlessly crosses generations; young guys heading for a weekend in Las Vegas with their buddies understand his appeal just as viscerally as their grandparents do. He never, in life, actively campaigned for this role -- the eternal model of coolness -- and in death it has just seemed to be bestowed upon him naturally.
His friend Frank Sinatra may have liked the image of being Chairman of the Board, but the core of Martin's enduring allure is that not only did he not want to be chairman, he didn't even want to serve on the board: It would mean that he would be cooped up in some boardroom for meetings when he'd rather be out playing golf. The sight of him in a tuxedo -- he wore it as comfortably as most men wear a pair of pajamas -- says to people who weren't even born when he was at the height of his fame: Take a deep breath and let yourself grin. Your problems can wait until tomorrow.
He didn't like to rehearse, his friends said, because he knew he would do just fine without it. As he grew older he didn't feel the need to endlessly seek out applause, because he had been so famous for so long -- his nightclub and motion picture partnership with Jerry Lewis, his own movie career, the Rat Pack years, his success as the host of his television shows, his sold-out concerts -- that he'd heard enough ovations to last a lifetime. His ease onstage made his audiences feel at ease, too; he seemed as at home in front of a packed Vegas concert crowd as he was in the den of his own house (his line at catching his first glimpse of an audience: "How did all these people get in my room?").
It had been a while since I'd talked with Gail Martin, but I called her the other evening, and she told me that, like the rest of us, she is forever encountering her dad's voice unexpectedly in public places: "It's always reassuring, it's always nice. I was in a store one holiday season, and there was a Christmas tape playing. A choir of some sort was singing a Christmas carol, and that ended and then there was my dad: 'Oh, the weather outside is frightful...' I just smiled a quiet smile. He's always there."
She said the reason he appeared so relaxed while working was because it wasn't an act. "Nothing seemed to bother him. And if something ever did, he sure wasn't going to bother anyone else with it." She said that when she was a girl and was in a bad mood at home, her dad, in that voice of voices, would say to her, without a bit of rancor: "Go up to your room if you're going to pout. Come on back down when you're happier."
In Florida the other night I was walking along the street and thought I heard him singing. It was a restaurant with an outdoor terrace; a local duo -- they billed themselves as Frank and Dean — was performing in front of one of those digital music machines that can replicate the sound of a full orchestra.
The shorter of the two was singing Sinatra songs, the taller was doing Dean Martin. The physical resemblance wasn't really there, but the songs were right. Whenever it became the Dean imitator's turn for a tune, he would jack the vibrato in his vocals into overdrive: "Everybody loves somebody sometime ... "
And the thing is, the people at the cafe were gravitating toward him. They were on their feet, beaming, moving closer to the microphone, some of them dancing, some just blissfully staring, seduced by the sound.
The singer looked as if he was accustomed to getting this reaction. It turns out that it's cool to be Dean Martin even when you're not really Dean Martin. Ain't that a kick in the head?

'Mother Nature's one-two punch' pounds Northeast
By David Ariosto and Tom Watkins, CNN
updated 10:41 PM EST, Wed November 7, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: "It's testing the resolve and the grit of my state," Newark mayor says
On Long Island's hard-hit coast, towns such as Oceanside still largely without power
"Everyone's really frazzled, angry," says Rick Wolkenberg, 59 Contractors go door-to-door to check electrical wiring on homes, businesses

New York (CNN) -- Residents of the northeastern United States, still reeling from the havoc Sandy wreaked October 29 on the region, learned Wednesday that the same holds true for snow and wind, which buffeted the coast in the form of a nor'easter.
More than 600,000 households who have been without power since October 29 hunkered down for a long, cold night.
"While this storm is not as dangerous as Sandy was, New Yorkers should still take safety precautions today and tonight," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Wednesday.
By 10 p.m., some four inches of snow had fallen on Staten Island, the borough of New York that was hard hit by Sandy. Parts of Connecticut saw more than eight inches.
"It's Mother Nature's one-two punch," Cory Baker, mayor of Newark, New Jersey, told CNN's "Piers Morgan." "It's testing the resolve and the grit of my state and my city and, obviously, this region."
Some 25,000 residents of Newark had still been without power from Sandy, he said. "Now, this is being dumped; it has the potential to knock out more power within my state."
Indeed, that is what happened. Power outages in New York and New Jersey rose from 607,000 during the day to 652,000 customers by 10 p.m.
Soon after, Elizabeth Flagler, a spokeswoman for the Long Island Power Authority, said the company had tallied 100,000 new power outages since the storm began, bringing its total to 193,000.
"We're getting hit pretty hard between the snow and the wind," she said.
Forecasters predicted gusts of up to 60 mph in shore towns and cities across New York and New Jersey, bringing 2- to 4-foot storm surges just as homes and office buildings had begun to dry out and floodwaters to recede after Sandy.
Coastal erosion caused by last week's storm sparked fears of more flooding in storm-battered communities, while incoming cold weather was expected to hamper utility restoration efforts across the region.

Photos: New York recovers from Sandy
Cold brings fresh misery to Sandy victims
Bloomberg urged residents in the city's low-lying areas -- especially Breezy Point, Hamilton Beach and Gerritsen Beach -- to "consider going someplace else tonight, to be a little bit on the safe side."
But he issued no mandatory evacuation orders, other than for a handful of chronic-care facilities and an adult-care center in areas that were hit hard by Sandy.
"If people think you're crying wolf, the next time, when it's really a serious threat, they might not do it," the mayor said.
That was not the case in New Jersey, where the Brick Township Office of Emergency Management had issued a mandatory evacuation order for all residents of low-lying waterfront areas of town.
Meanwhile, freezing temperatures ushered in snow and potentially deadly conditions for those without shelter, as displaced residents struggled to stay warm with generators and blankets. Others continued to camp with family and neighbors as they awaited the return of electricity.
On Tuesday night, about 8,500 Sandy victims had taken refuge in more than 100 Red Cross shelters. Temperatures were expected to dip again Wednesday night into the 20s, forecasters said.
Shelters were opened across the city for displaced residents or those without power.
"We think we're ready for anything," said Bloomberg, who ordered patrol officers to use their cruisers' loudspeakers to encourage elderly or homebound residents to go somewhere warm and safe and advised residents to check on neighbors.
Bloomberg tells struggling New Yorkers to get off the road
More than a week after Sandy struck the Northeast, its death toll in New York City climbed to 41 as a 78-year-old man died Tuesday of injuries suffered in the storm, police said.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo fired his chief of emergency management, Steven Kuhr, for having arranged for the Suffolk County Office of Emergency Management to clear a tree from his driveway, a Cuomo administration source told CNN.
CNN was not able to reach Kuhr.
The continuing recovery effort had already left thousands of area residents tired, homeless and looking for answers.
New York City's Penn Station was shut for a time on Wednesday evening because of overcrowding after the Long Island Railroad halted service systemwide, Metropolitan Transit Authority spokeswoman Marjorie Anders told CNN.
The stations reopened later in the evening and service resumed, she said.
As many as 20,000 households across New York City and Westchester County were not expected to be back online by the weekend because of damage to their homes' electrical systems, officials said.
Contractors will need to check the electrical wiring in each home and business to ensure that power can be safely restored, Bloomberg said. Salt-caked wiring could ignite once the power is restored.
Superstorm Sandy's victims
On Long Island's hard-hit coast, towns such as Oceanside remained largely without power.
"The lights came on for three minutes here. Everybody cheered like A-Rod (Alex Rodriguez) hit one out at Yankee Stadium," said Rick Wolkenberg. "Then there was this weird hum and everything went out again. They teased us, and now we're sitting here in the dark again."
The 59-year-old mortgage lender said his staff has been working for days in his office by means of a small generator and flashlights.
"Everyone's really frazzled, angry," he said. "It's not just the power. Now it's getting an electrician to evaluate the house, then getting a plumber -- and nobody's coming because they're all overwhelmed."
His 81-year-old mother, Edith, moved in with his family after Sandy slammed through her home in Oceanside.
"There just seems so many obstacles now," Wolkenberg said.
"It is like a war zone down there," Gov. Chris Christie said, referring to places such as Ocean County's Mantoloking, where flooding and fires wiped out large sections of the town last week.
At least 20 homes burned to the ground there, mirroring an incident in Breezy Point, a Queens neighborhood where a cluster of more than 100 houses caught fire during the storm.
"We don't know what to expect for the flooding situation as the shorelines have been changed," Christie said. "For many of them, the dunes are gone. So, moderate flooding under normal conditions becomes major in these conditions."
More than three-fourths of New Jersey's school systems were operating Wednesday and 1,728 public schools were open in New York.
Elsewhere, there were signs of the region rebounding.
The PATH train between New Jersey and New York resumed limited service under the Hudson River on Tuesday, after being shut ahead of the storm.
Commuter traffic reopened Wednesday in the Holland Tunnel, where about 91,000 vehicles typically pass under the Hudson River between Manhattan and Jersey City, New Jersey.
Air travel continued to be affected. Authorities advised air travelers to check with their carriers ahead of the storm.
"Airlines serving the Port Authority's major airports -- Newark Liberty International, John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia -- have canceled all or a significant number of their flights beginning at noon today and continuing through early tomorrow," the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said Wednesday in a statement.

New late-stage breast cancer treatment approved By Ashley Hayes, CNN
updated 5:43 PM EST, Fri February 22, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The drug, Kadcyla, presents a new way to knock out cancer cells
It's meant for some patients with a certain type of metastatic breast cancer
The drug should be available to patients within two weeks
(CNN) -- A drug that presents a new way to knock out cancer cells was approved Friday to treat patients with a certain type of late-stage metastatic breast cancer.
The drug, referred to as T-DM1 during clinical research, will now be known by the brand name Kadcyla, the Food and Drug Administration said in its approval announcement. It's a new therapy for women with HER2-positive breast cancer.
Kadcyla is a combination of the targeted drug trastuzumab -- better known by the brand name Herceptin -- and a powerful chemotherapy drug called DM1. It's designed to work when Herceptin alone can no longer keep cancer in check.
DM1 is too toxic to deliver directly into a patient's bloodstream, like other chemotherapy drugs. The Herceptin part of the new drug homes in on cancer cells, sparing other healthy cells, and delivers DM1 into the cell.
Is less more in breast cancer treatment?
Fighting cancer with fashion
"Kadcyla delivers the drug to the cancer site to shrink the tumor, slow disease progression and prolong survival," said Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a statement. The drug is the fourth approved to target the HER2 protein.
Genentech, the company that developed the drug, is working to get it to patients "imminently," said spokesman Susan Willson. "As soon as humanly possible, but within two weeks at the outside."
Kadcyla will cost about $9,800 monthly, which Willson said is "similar to the cost of other treatment regimens in this line of therapy." The estimated cost of a course of Kadcyla -- 9½ months -- is about $94,000.
But "we want to ensure that people who are eligible for this medicine have access to it," Willson said. Genentech plans to initiate patient assistance programs for the drug to help those who might not be able to afford it; those without health insurance or those who have reached the lifetime limit set by their insurance companies may qualify to receive Kadcyla for free.
Experimental drug offers new way to battle certain breast cancer
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women, according to the National Cancer Institute and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell growth. It's found in increased amounts on some types of cancer cells. In HER2-positive breast cancers, the increased amount of the protein contributes to cancer call growth and survival. Nearly 20% of breast cancers have increased amounts of HER2.
Researchers announced the results of a large three-year clinical trial of Kadcyla in June, saying they were optimistic about it. One significant benefit, according to lead study author Dr. Kimberly Blackwell of Duke University, is the lack of significant side effects and a better quality of life for patients on the drug.
Patients participating in the trial, she said, were the first group for whom officials worried about fixing their hair for media interviews.
It's important to note, however, that Kadcyla is not the same as Herceptin and could cause serious side effects including liver problems and heart problems such as congestive heart failure or even death. It also can cause life-threatening birth defects, meaning pregnant women should not take it.
The FDA's approval of the drug comes with the requirement that the prescribing information comes with a boxed warning alerting patients about the possibility of these side effects.
However, the potential risks may be acceptable to women who have no other options, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.
Kadcyla, known as an "antibody-drug conjugate," represents "a completely new way" to treat HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, said Dr. Hal Barron, chief medical officer and head of global product development for Genentech.
An antibody-drug conjugate is described by the company as "a new kind of targeted medicine that can attach to certain types of cells and deliver chemotherapy directly to them."
"We currently have more than 25 antibody-drug conjugates in our pipeline and hope this promising approach will help us deliver more medicines to fight other cancers in the future," Barron said in a statement.

Massive spying on Americans is outrageous By Coleen Rowley, Special to CNN updated 10:53 AM EDT, Tue June 11, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Coleen Rowley: Surveillance programs create huge profit for private contractors Rowley: More importantly, stopping terrorists through mass data collection doesn't work She says just look at how the Bush administration failed on 9/11 despite early warnings
Rowley: Secretive spying programs harm national security and threaten democracy Editor's note: Coleen Rowley, a FBI special agent for almost 24 years, was legal counsel to the FBI Field Office in Minneapolis from 1990 to 2003. She wrote a whistle-blower memo in May 2002 and testified to the Senate Judiciary on some of the FBI's pre-9/11 failures. She writes and speaks about ethical decision-making and civil liberties issues. (CNN) -- "Everything secret degenerates, even the administration of justice; nothing is safe that cannot bear discussion and publicity." -- Lord Acton The recent disclosures about the National Security Agency's massive and aggressive spying on the world, including U.S. citizens, along with other scandals showing Associated Press and Fox News reporters targeted in "leak" investigations, should make us realize that John Poindexter's plan for "Total Information Awareness" never died: It merely went underground and changed its name.
When the TIA idea was first proposed by the Bush administration after 9/11, along with a "Big Brother" all-seeing eye logo, it was widely considered a crazy notion, resulting in an outcry. That data collection plan, which involved indiscriminate spying on Americans, was quickly squelched -- at least publicly.
The truth, however, was that it was reborn under dozens of massive data collection and surveillance programs within each of our 16 highly secretive intelligence agencies, under a variety of cute acronyms.
Coleen Rowley
These programs falsely purport to get "novel intelligence from massive data." (In fact, NIMD is the actual, self-explanatory name of one such program). Few within the national intelligence community complained about the wrongfulness, illegality or ineffectiveness -- let alone the waste and fraud -- of programs that create billions in profit for private surveillance contractors, technology experts and intelligence operatives and analysts.
But there's no evidence the NIMD theory has worked. Researchers long ago concluded that the NIMD-type promise of detecting and accurately stopping terrorists through massive data collection was simply not possible.
Opinion: Edward Snowden is a hero
Think about how Bush administration officials defended themselves from not following up on the incredibly specific intelligence warnings urgently going to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet and National Counterterrorism Director Richard Clark in the months leading up to 9/11. Their common response back then was something along the line of: intelligence is like a fire hose, and you can't get a sip from a fire hose. There was apparently too much for top officials to even read the key memos addressed to them.
Assange to Snowden: Go to Latin America
What is the NSA leaker's endgame?
But if intelligence was a fire hose before 9/11, it quickly became Niagara Falls.
And now, with so much data (almost all of it irrelevant) that has been sucked into government databases and computers, one might liken the "intelligence flow" to a tsunami, with analysts asked to find just the right drop of water. Good luck.
In fact, The Washington Post's well-researched series in 2010 on "Top Secret America" reported that the NSA was collecting and storing around 1.7 billion pieces of information every 24 hours, even back then.
To switch metaphors, it does not make it easier to find a needle in a haystack if you continue to add hay. No one has ever explained why it was left to fellow passengers or alert street vendors, not the "intelligence" agencies, to stop the last four major terrorist attacks or attempted attacks on U.S. soil.
When the Bush administration's illegal monitoring was revealed by The New York Times in December 2005, a cover-up of sorts ensued. By labeling it the "terrorist surveillance program," Bush and his closest intelligence officials scared Congress and the people into believing that the surveillance was something other than a dragnet -- that it was limited to terrorist suspects, or at least to foreign nationals, and did not encompass all Americans. Few believed at the time that such a colossal secret system could eventually be used against American news agencies and reporters, activists and other officials.
Fast forward to President Barack Obama's response to the recent confirmation about the extent of the NSA's "metadata" collection of our telephone and Internet information. Keep in mind that the NSA is just one of the 16 agencies involved in data gathering and storage.
Opinion: Your biggest secrets are up for grabs
A courageous person of conscience -- Edward Snowden -- has now openly confirmed it all but is already suffering official demonization because he felt it important for the wider public to know and debate the magnitude and reach of the U.S. government's secret monitoring. The disclosures have caused Obama and other officials to more or less admit that massive government surveillance erodes citizens' individual privacy, but they claim that it is a necessary trade-off in the quest for security. Omitted was proof that such a strategy even works.
The excessive secrecy and increasing compartmentalization in "top secret America" actually reduces information sharing, which the post 9/11 investigations concluded was the major failure and root cause that allowed the 9/11 attacks to occur. Some of us even wonder if the 9/11 attacks could have been prevented if WikiLeaks or a similar channel had existed to get out the serious threats and information that surfaced in the months beforehand but were ignored, unread or became blocked in the "fire hose."
Secretive spying programs actually harm national security. And arguably worse, they pose, as Snowden stated, "an existential threat to democracy." The Bill of Rights limits government prerogative by ensuring that a measure of evidence and proof are necessary before police can detain people or search their homes and other areas of privacy.
The threat to democracy lies not only in the evisceration of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process, right against self-incrimination and coerced confessions and other rights that form the backbone of the criminal justice system, but also in eroding freedom of the press, seeing journalists and reporters as "aiding and abetting" the criminal telling of government secrets. Secrets, by the way, that shouldn't even be secret.
Few graphs climb as sharply upward as this one tracing the line from 6 million government documents classified "secret" in 1996 to 92 million secret in 2011. What will be the figure in 2013? Will we need someone such as Snowden to tell us? Has Thomas Jefferson's notion that the bedrock of democracy rests on an informed citizenry become as "quaint" as the Geneva Conventions?
The notion that we must choose between abiding by the Constitution and improving security is fundamentally false, as Obama noted when first campaigning for the presidency. But his recent response was a flip flop exploiting people's fear of terrorism to say he cannot ensure their "100% security" unless people give up their privacy and convenience to allow the massive NSA monitoring. A lot more than privacy and convenience is at stake.
What is at risk here is simply the rule of law, whose keystone is the concept of due process, as derived from the Magna Carta and enshrined in the Bill of Rights. Once due process goes, we can wave goodbye also to freedom of speech, freedom of press and freedom of assembly.
Opinion: Why we need government surveillance
It has happened before.
One need to only look to the operation of the House Un-American Activities Committee in the late 1940s and '50s to recall a time when rights were suspended and to be accused meant to be convicted of a thought crime. Often considered the smartest man of the last century, Albert Einstein died with a nearly 2,000 page FBI file.
J. Edgar Hoover gathered secret information on anyone and everyone of consequence, which gave him power over some presidents. In the 1960s, the FBI's COINTELPRO (counter-intelligence program) secretly monitored civil rights, anti-war and even feminist groups.
Hoover's "black bag jobs" against such public activists as Martin Luther King Jr., secret blackmailing attempts and nonjudicial "disruption" of these groups is what actually led to the Church Committee investigation of abuses and the creation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which the NSA has now effectively dismantled.
Who wants to go back to the good ole' HUAC-Hoover era?
I'm afraid that secrecy will inherently continue to degenerate everything and everybody it touches. Thank goodness for some persons of conscience such as Edward Snowden and for a little truth getting out!

Humans the biggest threat to marine species
The gentoo penguin population on the Falkland Islands has fallen about 43 percent since surveys were first conducted in 1932-33
October 12, 1998
Web posted at: 4:30 PM EDT
By Environmental News Network staff
(ENN) -- Seaweb, an organization devoted to raising public awareness of the world ocean, has issued its monthly Ocean Update for October, and the news is not good. The update summarizes research on fisheries, global warming and bycatch. In all of these categories human impact on marine species is the biggest threat they face. Some of the studies reviewed:
The barndoor skate, one of the largest skates in the northwest Atlantic, is close to extinction as a result of being killed as by-catch in cod, redfish and other trawl fisheries. The report's authors estimate that in a large fisheries area south of Newfoundland, the barndoor skate population probably numbered some 600,000 individuals in the 1950s; by the 1970s, this number was likely around 500. The authors also say that if a large, easily identified species can dwindle away in a well-surveyed area, then the fate of poorly-known species is probably worse.
Black guillemots have only been hanging around in northern Alaska for the past 25 years, but it looks like they're moving on as a result of global climate change. Arctic sea ice, on which guillemots rely as refuge and as habitat for the Arctic cod on which they feed, is retreating, forcing the birds to fly farther in search of food. The guillemots' decline is, according to the author of the study, one of the "first documented biological effects" of climate change in the Arctic.
Spectacled eider population declines on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, are probably the result of eating lead shot. The populations have declined rapidly during the 1980s and low adult female survival is the likely cause of the decline. The authors found that adult females exposed to lead prior to hatching their eggs survived at a much lower rate each year than females not exposed to lead before hatching.
Gentoo and Rockhopper penguin populations on the Falkland Islands have undergone precipitous declines. The gentoo penguin population has fallen about 43 per cent and the Rockhopper penguin population has declined about 90 percent since surveys were first conducted in 1932/33. Recent monitoring suggests that the declines in both species are continuing. The news is particularly bad for the rockhopper since the Falklands represent the world's most important breeding site for the species.
King penguins, another Falklands penguin, is the only species that seems to be thriving; their numbers have increased by 700 percent -- to about 400 pairs -- since 1980-81, in line with worldwide trends for this species. The fourth main Falklands penguin, the Magelannic, was not included in the census because of the difficulties associated with counting a species that nests in burrows.
Humpback whales, predominantly calves, are suffering from more fishing line entanglements and human-related deaths off the coasts of Hawaii than ever before. Figures showed an increasing trend of entanglement in natural fiber and synthetic lines since 1992 and a three-fold increase in death and entanglement occurrences related to human activity in 1996.
The Australian king prawn fishery was studied to assess levels of bycatch, and the news could hardly be worse. Researchers chose an oceanic prawn trawl fishery off the coast of southeastern Australia that involved some 280 vessels. They monitored four of the largest and most important fleets (out of 11). In catching an estimated 1,579 tons of prawn, the four fleets also caught some 16,435 tons of bycatch involving 80 species of finfish, crustaceans and mollusks. This makes the bycatch to prawn ratio 10.4:1. Of this, an estimated 2,952 tons was retained for sale and the remainder, 13,458 tons, was thrown overboard.
Florida Keys coral reef fish stocks have been something of a mystery to scientists because of a lack of data. However, a recent study showed that of the 35 fish stocks looked at, which included 16 grouper species, 13 of snapper, five of grunt, and the great barracuda, 22 -- or 63 percent -- were in an "overfished" condition. The authors of the study said that given the inevitable increases in fishing effort and habitat degradation by rapid human population growth, overfishing is likely to continue. They also felt that the dynamics and structure of the overall coral community may have already seen "substantial changes."
Sharks are severely threatened, and a failure to enact state regulations by Atlantic and Gulf Coast states is seriously undermining federal efforts to protect them, according to a report released by the Ocean Wildlife Campaign. Five years ago, the National Marine Fisheries Service instituted a fishery management plan to prevent overfishing of sharks in federal waters but the sharks aren't seeing the lines, apparently, and move in and out of federal waters and get caught in state waters where they aren't protected. In addition, says the report, sharks are threatened by high levels of bycatch and by destruction of bays and estuaries that are important nursery grounds for their young.
