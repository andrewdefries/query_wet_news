World views: Nice style, now action neededStory Highlights Obama's lifted restrictions for Cuban-Americans traveling home Drugs, poverty and climate change is also on the minds south of the U.S. South Korea and U.S. appear to be seeing eye-to-eye over North Korea Kenya waiting to see how African policy develops but pleased he spoke out on piracy Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- A new tone between Venezuelan firebrand President Hugo Chavez and the new man at the helm of what Chavez calls the U.S Empire. Obama and Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez shook hands but Chavez then gave Obama a book accusing the U.S. of neo-colonialism. Obama's only concrete step in Latin America in 100 Days was lifting restrictions on Cuban-Americans visiting their homeland. But former Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia says Obama is fueling a new mood. She said: "We've received more signals in Obama's first 100 days than we did over eight years with President Bush." With pressing problems like the bloody drug war sweeping Mexico Obama will need big actions to match big words. For the last 20 years U.S. administrations have waged but never won a military offensive on narcotrafficking in Colombia. Mejia is urging Obama to not repeat those mistakes in Mexico. But Colombia-American Chamber of Commerce director Miguel Gomez said: 'The top problem for Latin America must be social inequality and poverty, the issue of economic growth must be the most important point of our agenda." Gomez and Mejia agree Obama musat learn to live with leftist regimes -- like Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador -- even if they have been hostile to Washington.

Obama more popular than policies, poll shows
And from a forgotten corner comes another message to the U.S. president -- from ancient indigenous tribes, self-declared guardians of the natural world. One spiritual authority warned political and economic progress could not come at the expense of the planet. With his performance at the Americas Summit, Obama showed a lot of style. Now Latin America will look for the substance. South Korea Walk into most book stores in South Korea, and there will likely be a special corner dedicated to Obama-related books. Not just his own writings, but both critical and observations about the new U.S. president, books dealing with the new first lady, and an army of CDs and other products that offer a variety of Obama speeches for the English-learning hungry South Koreans. In the children's section of one of the biggest bookstores in Korea there was a number of comic books dedicated to telling Korean kids what a great thinker and role model Obama was. Watch opinions from around the world » The infatuation Koreans feel towards all things related to the U.S. first family is a welcome relief for the country's troubled publishing industry. Among the books are some that deal with the U.S. president's North Korea policies. When Obama was elected, there were many that expected a much softer policy towards North Korea. The carrot over the stick approach to getting Pyongyang to agree to disable and dismantle its nuclear facilities. Not everyone was pleased. Especially since the new South Korean president put forth a tougher more hard-lined North Korean policy. But Secretary of State Clinton has so far maintained a firm stance towards Pyongyang and it seems Seoul and Washington so far have seen eye to eye on how to deal with the difficult North Korean situation. Africa During the U.S. election campaign and at inauguration Kenyans were mad about Obama. In fact, Kenya was the epicenter of global Obamamania. After all, Obama's father was Kenyan and he still has family in the west of the country. After 100 days in office, Obama is still wildly popular here, but that has been tempered by a dose of reality. "Everyone in Kenya wants to call Obama a Kenyan," says Samson Josiah, a marketing business owner in Nairobi, "but Obama is not the president of Kenya, he is not the patron of Africa, he is the president of America." The refrain is the same throughout the capital. "We are sort of getting used to him now," says Diana Ngila, a communications student, "We are not really seeing much. I think (we need to see) his actions -- then we can say we are celebrating Obama." While George W. Bush had dismal approval ratings across the world, here in sub-Saharan Africa he is perceived to have done a lot to fight AIDS and malaria and expand trade links. And so far, say Kenyans, Obama hasn't said much about the continent. "He has spoken about the issue of piracy," says Ngila, "but not much else." Kenyans are pleased that Obama has spoken out on the headline grabbing scourge of piracy. But they are hoping for more to be done on the ground. But while Kenyan's might grumble about the lack of policy attention, they universally find him a likeable president that they feel has changed the viewpoint on America. iReport.com: Grade Obama's first 100 days "His personality is not at all imposing," says Alan Alabu, a small business owner in Nairobi. "You feel like you connect to him on a human level."

Ashley Judd confronts Africa's deadly mineral issue STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ashley Judd: Humanitarian travelers should check motives, learn local context Judd: Valuable minerals in electronics fuel mass rape in Democratic Republic of Congo "Until we disrupt how lucrative it is for the militias, things are not going to change," she says Help victims by donating to aid groups, e-mailing electronics makers, Judd says Editor's note: Ashley Judd traveled to eastern Congo, her second time to the region, with John Prendergast of the Enough Project at the Center for American Progress (http://www.enoughproject.org/). Since 2003, Ashley has traveled the world visiting vulnerable populations, especially girls and women, focusing on grassroots solutions that transform and save lives. Amongst other affiliations, she serves on the board of Population Services International. For more information on the campaign against conflict minerals visit raisehopeforcongo.org. (CNN) -- With a dozen humanitarian missions behind her, Ashley Judd has ventured to Africa to challenge the relationship between valuable minerals and unspeakable violence. She's meeting this week with local businessmen, officials and victims of rape and other atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to raise awareness about the issue of conflict minerals. Natural resources such as tin, tantalum and tungsten -- which are used to make the world's cell phones, computers and other electronics -- fuel continued violence in Congo, especially mass rapes. Judd spoke to CNN on Monday from the city of Bukavu in eastern Congo about what she witnessed at one of the African nation's camps for displaced persons and how she prepares for difficult humanitarian trips. Complete coverage: Humanitarian Travel CNN: Could you help us to connect the dots between the rape victims you've met in these camps and the materials used in the electronics industry? JUDD: The armed militias make war on a woman's body. In Congolese society, women are the pillars. They are the backbone. They are the heart, and so when an external force wants to destroy a society, wreck havoc, disrupt, the most efficient, direct and -- in a way -- sickeningly cunningly brilliant way to do it is to literally attack the woman's body. Gallery: The journey of conflict minerals
Map: Democratic Republic of Congo
The armed militias can simply set up ... access to phenomenal mineral wealth.--Ashley Judd
And by humiliating women and terrorizing families, the militias achieve their objective of literally displacing them, literally running them out of their homes so that the armed militias can simply set up without obstacles, without barriers -- access to phenomenal mineral wealth on which these families are living. If a family is not displaced, they are wholly subjugated. Perhaps they don't vacate their homes, but they're dominated and tyrannized by the ongoing presence of the militias. When I arrived at the camp ... the situation is so jaw-droppingly raw. They lack basic services. There's no running water. The water that they do have access to is not really safe for drinking, but they drink it anyway. There's certainly no water for showers or luxuries of that nature. The latrines are poorly dug holes. And people's accommodation is corn husks and sticks and sometimes UN-issued sheets of plastic or -- ironically in one of my new friends' homes -- a cardboard box that American-made goods had been transported in. Her interior decoration was cardboard stamped with "USA." All three of the women I met had been living in the camp for two years. All three of them had been raped multiple times. Two of them had been gang-raped twice; one of them had been gang-raped three times. Part of what's really important to note is that the perpetrators of these atrocities were both FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda] and Congolese militia. [Editor's note: The FDLR consists of Rwandan Hutus blamed for the 1994 genocide who fled into the lawless provinces of eastern Congo, where their presence fueled a five-year war that killed more than 3 million people.] It was pretty stunning that these women were willing to admit that they had been raped, in fact, by Congolese militia. All three of them had borne children conceived in rape. All three of them said they made no distinction between the children and the baby born of rape. All three were unimaginably and desperately poor. When I asked them what kind of future they could possibly envision for themselves, they're in survival mode, and it literally was about where the next meal is coming from. They couldn't even get to the place where we could talk about the dream of an education for their children. They're just not there. We need to put so much pressure on these electronics companies, because it's incredibly lucrative right now, and until we disrupt how lucrative it is for the militias, things are not going to change. See more on the connection between minerals and militias CNN: What can Americans do that would directly improve the future of women like the ones you met? JUDD: I have four things that I suggest. For immediate triage, something that can literally in a very short amount of time make an appreciable difference in the life of a survivor of gender violence is to sponsor Congolese women through Women for Women International. Anyone can go to womenforwomen.org and literally with a click and a small financial commitment put money in the hands of a survivor of gender violence. The other immediate piece of triage that Americans can do is contribute to Population Services International, which has grass-roots health interventions and helps poor women deal with preventable disease, family planning, HIV, because a lot of them become HIV positive after they've been raped, because they're raped by so many men, their exposure to HIV is very high. Also, we can contribute to Doctors Without Borders. See a map of the Democratic Republic of Congo To genuinely end the root causes of mass rape in eastern DRC, people can send an e-mail immediately to the world's top 20 electronics manufacturers and absolutely demand insist that these manufacturers create a clean supply of minerals that they use in their products and that end up in our pockets. Opinion: Stopping flow of conflict minerals to your cell phone CNN: How do you maintain the commitment to your cause while maintaining the rest of your life? JUDD: In a way, what happens to the women of Congo is also happening to me, and I also lose my humanity. I compromise my integrity when I do not engage in their struggle. And it's not easy. One of the things that has really helped me cope over the years is keeping an extensive diary. I started in Cambodia on the first day I went to a genocide museum there. And then the next thing I knew, I was at Svay Pak. I didn't even know what Svay Pak was. It took me a while to figure out that the first brothel I ever went to was one of the most infamous notorious brothels in the entire world. And that night, I thought I was going to die. I thought I was going to die from grief. The grief comes up even when I just remember it. It's amazing, I walk into a woman's home, and she opens up her life to me. She tells me everything. She endows me with this beautiful sacred trust of her story, and I'm telling you that's all she has. She has her children, and she has her story. That is it. And I promise her, I will never forget her. I tell her I will share her story with other American women, and I will speak her story to power. I say, "I cannot make promises to you about what my government will do, but I promise you I will take action on your behalf." U.S. law targets 'conflict minerals' in Congo CNN: What are some of your personal emotional driving forces behind your humanitarian journeys? JUDD: The trips I take are indeed phenomenally emotionally grueling. I always go through a breakdown, and by the grace of God today and because of the brilliant grass-roots solutions that already exist in most countries that simply need to be amplified and incorporated into policy on the government and transnational level, I also have a breakthrough. CNN: In general, how should travelers planning humanitarian missions prepare emotionally, mentally and practically for journeys to remote and possibly dangerous places? JUDD: Number one: Check your motives. That's the most important thing. That night, I thought I was going to die. I thought I was going to die from grief. --Ashley Judd

Number two: Understand the local context. Educate yourself. Reach out to experts, both at the policy level as well as the grass-roots level. Read books about the history of the place. And also be savvy about the particular historical perspective that the author may have. Watch documentaries. I watched "Born into Brothels" before I started spending time in brothels in Mumbai, India, and it was very helpful for me to kind of spiritually fortify myself because I had the visual. I knew what they looked like, what they sounded like, before I went, and so that helped me skip over the visceral shock of walking into these phenomenally crowded, fetid brothels. I had a spiritual director in my life and a spiritual community with whom I stay very current -- and that's enormously important to me. Because eastern Congo is what it is, it's such a severe place and the problems are so huge, I had my crisis of faith and my breakdown within 72 hours of getting here. Normally, it happens like three weeks into a trip, but this place just cut me off at the knees immediately, and I had to reach out to people with whom I'm walking this walk -- both through e-mail and through telephone -- and that sort of helped me have that breakthrough and tap back into my resilience. CNN: There is often a significant cultural divide travelers encounter when journeying to places like the Eastern Congo. Are there any strategies you'd recommend for folks who are facing this challenge? JUDD: Learn the difference between pity and empathy, charity and self efficacy. Abandon the former, which is patronizing, practice the latter, which builds capacity. Accept your will, in spite of your most noble intentions and earnest aspirations, bring unconscious biases and prejudices with you. It is impossible not to. Have the humility to spot, admit, and correct your own thinking. Live your amends. Take care of your mental health. Any unhealthy coping mechanism you have, or -ism (compulsion/obsession/addiction), will be triggered and amplified. You are not the exception, no matter how strong your faith and will. Consider therapy, a 12-step program, or other healing modality before you go, and continue to seek help and support. Remember: denial stands for "Don't Even Know I Am Lying." The work may be rewarding, but it is also intensely grueling. You will pay high costs for not taking care of yourself. Rejoice in your opportunity. Practice an attitude of gratitude in everything you do. The world, even in the most desperate places, is full of wonder and miracles.

'The Dark Knight Rises' ranks on American Film Institute's best-movies list
By Anthony Breznican, EW.com
updated 4:50 PM EST, Mon December 10, 2012
Christian Bale and Anne Hathaway star in "The Dark Knight Rises."
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"The Dark Knight Rises's" AFI mention could remind the Academy to consider it
The Academy expanded its best picture field three years ago
the Oscars could select anywhere from five to 10 nominees for best picture
(EW.com) -- The American Film Institute has thrown an awards lifeline to "The Dark Knight Rises."
The group doesn't choose a best picture, it only ranks the 10 best movies of the year and lists them alphabetically, and this year's list could easily mirror the eventual best-picture field for the Academy Awards. The six locks for a nomination — "Argo," "Les Miserables," "Life of Pi," "Lincoln," "Silver Linings Playbook" and "Zero Dark Thirty" — are all on AFI's list.
But the Oscars could select anywhere from five to 10 nominees, and with so many worthy contenders this year the list is likely to go long. So could AFI's choices be a good gauge for what might fill those other four slots?
If you're Christopher Nolan, you've got to hope so.
When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences expanded its best picture field three years ago, it was in part due to the feeling that "The Dark Knight" was best-picture worthy, but fell just short. Including more movies, including pop favorites like that one, was seen as a way to excite more viewers about the telecast.
L.A. and Boston critics hand out awards
But so far, "The Dark Knight Rises" hasn't generated the same awards heat. It's in the conversation, for sure, but this is also a stellar year for films and competition is fierce.
Among the other movies jockeying for a slot on the best picture list are "Moonrise Kingdom," "Beasts of the Southern Wild" and "Django Unchained" — which are also on AFI's list.
The choice by the AFI jury, made up of scholars, and film and TV professions, to include "The Dark Knight Rises" gives that movie a much-needed jolt of adrenaline in the awards race. Oscar voters are certainly aware of the film, and Nolan and company have been out campaigning for it a lot lately, but the AFI mention should remind those Academy members to give it some consideration for best of the year.

From public transport to popemobile: Bergoglio's journey to top of the church
By Dana Ford, CNN
updated 7:58 AM EDT, Thu March 14, 2013
Pope Francis pauses for a moment to pray and lay his hands on a man with a disfiguring disease. His encounter with the ailing man occurred in Vatican City on Wednesday, November 6, at the end of the general audience, which had about 50,000 attendees.
Pope Francis celebrates mass in St. Peter's Square to mark the 30th Sunday of Ordinary Time and the World Family Day on October 27.

Before becoming Pope Francis, he was Argentinian Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the former archbishop of Buenos Aires. The announcement for the selection of a new pope came on Wednesday, March 13, the first full day of the cardinals' conclave in the Sistine Chapel.
Bergoglio arrives for the congregation meeting at Synod Hall in the Vatican on March 7.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The new pope reportedly has just one lung; he is 76
He is the first Jesuit to become pope
He will be called Pope Francis, in honor of St. Francis of Assisi He is the first non-European pontiff of the modern era, the first from South America
(CNN) -- Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina is known as a humble man, a capable administrator and -- as expected of a new pope -- a man of great faith.
Those and other qualities will be put to the test as he embarks on his most historic role yet.
Cardinal Bergoglio elected pope
On Wednesday, cardinals elected Bergoglio to be the first non-European pope in the modern era. He is the first pontiff from South America, and the first Jesuit to be elected head of the Roman Catholic Church.
"The new pope is a very humble man," said the Rev. Eduardo Mangiarotti, an Argentine priest. "He takes public transport every day. He is a strongly devoted man to the poorest and suffering people in his dioceses. He is a passionate preacher and a man of prayer."

New pope 'big surprise' for Argentina
At the same time, Mangiarotti described Bergoglio, who will be called Pope Francis in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, as a man of action, and someone who can command attention.
5 things to know about Pope Francis
"When he preaches, he's a man who can make the people listen to him. And not only Catholic people, I mean not only the people who belong to the church, but he's also very known nationwide. The people in our country really know him and also look up to him --- the way he addresses issues regarding social justice, education, our own identify as a nation," Mangiarotti said.
In his first public act, the new pope broke with tradition by asking the estimated 150,000 people packed into St. Peter's Square to pray for him, rather than bless the crowd first.
"He is a very simple man," said Luis R. Zarama, auxiliary bishop of Atlanta. "It's very clear from the way he approached the people and asked them to bless him and pray for him. It's a beautiful sign of closeness and humility."
A voice for the poor
Francis, 76, was born in Buenos Aires on December 17, 1936. The son of an Italian immigrant, he trained as a chemist before deciding to become a priest.
He was ordained by the Jesuits in 1969 and became co-archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1997, sole archbishop of that city one year later. He was made a cardinal in 2001 and served as president of the Argentine bishops conference from 2005-11.
As cardinal, Francis clashed with the government of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives.
Pope's name choice 'precedent shattering'
He was runner-up in the 2005 papal conclave, behind then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, according to a profile by CNN Vatican analyst John Allen published by the National Catholic Reporter.
The new pope brings together the first and the developing worlds, Allen writes. Besides his Italian roots, Francis studied theology in Germany.
His career coincided with the so-called Dirty War in Argentina, which lasted from 1976 until 1983. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 people were killed or disappeared during the country's military dictatorship.
The church was seen by some as having not have done enough that period. In particular, Francis was accused in a complaint filed three days before the 2005 conclave of complicity in the 1976 kidnapping of two liberal Jesuit priests, Allen writes. Francis reportedly denied the charge.
He is known for his simplicity and has a reputation of being a voice for the poor.
"We live in the most unequal part of the world, which has grown the most yet reduced misery the least," Allen quoted Francis as saying during a gathering of Latin American bishops in 2007. "The unjust distribution of goods persists, creating a situation of social sin that cries out to heaven and limits the possibilities of a fuller life for so many of our brothers."
First Latin American pope 'very exciting'
'The butt kicker that's needed'
Francis is fan of the San Lorenzo soccer club in Argentina, and a lover of tango, according to Telam, Argentina's state news agency.
Telam says the new pope has just one lung, but a Vatican spokesman said he was unable to confirm whether that report was true.
As a Jesuit, Francis is a member of the Society of Jesus, one of the biggest and most important orders in the church. Jesuits are recognized for their exceptional educational institutions and focus on social justice.
"The new Pope Francis is supposedly a reformer of sorts. He reformed the Jesuits, fighting against liberation theology when that was on the rise in Argentina," said Raymond Arroyo, a CNN contributor and Catholic television host.
About 480 million of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics live in Latin America, but no one from the region had ever been chosen as pope. By electing who they did, the cardinals sent a strong message about where the future of the church may lie.
Francis takes the helm of a Catholic Church that has been rocked in recent years by sex abuse by priests and claims of corruption and infighting among the church hierarchy.
"From the people I've spoken to here in the Vatican who know him well, they say he is, pardon the French here, the butt kicker that's needed," Arroyo said.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Walter Olson: Those upset with verdict call for giving new powers to prosecutors Olson: The unintended effect of this would be that more black men would end up in prisons
He says what really went wrong in the Zimmerman case is the prosecution's misdeeds
Olson: To help minorities in the justice system, don't look to taking away defendants' rights Editor's note: Walter Olson is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies.
(CNN) -- People upset at George Zimmerman's acquittal are calling for awarding various new powers to prosecutors at the expense of protections for criminal defendants.
Maybe this would make it easier to hang a rap on some future Zimmerman. But it also would have an effect that its backers probably don't intend: increasing the number of persons convicted and sent to prison. As part of that effect, more young black men -- as well as more members of other groups -- will end up behind bars.
On Twitter and Facebook, many people have expressed frustration with the conviction standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt," which the state of Florida was unable to overcome. Couldn't we lower it? Others hoped prosecutors could appeal the verdict (right now, they can't; an acquittal is final).
Walter Olson
To change either of these basic features of our judicial system, we'd have to overturn the Supreme Court's settled view of the Bill of Rights or amend the U.S. Constitution itself. And what would happen if we did? Convictions would rise, and the nation's outlandishly large and disproportionately black prison rolls would swell yet further.
Or consider the popular notion of retrying Zimmerman on federal charges.
Under our Constitution, even serious crimes such as murder are traditionally offenses under state law only.
In a controversial 1959 opinion, Bartkus v. Illinois, the Supreme Court ruled that consecutive prosecutions under state and federal law do not violate the Constitution's ban on double jeopardy. Interestingly, that was the view of the court's five more conservative justices. The dissenters, who warned eloquently of the dangers of letting government try people twice for the same conduct, were the four liberals: Earl Warren, William Douglas, Hugo Black and William Brennan.
Trayvon Martin's parents talk verdict Trayvon's mom: Verdict was total shock
For many years thereafter, such prosecutions were a rare exception. Occasionally they were of national note, as when a Jim Crow authority would refuse to prosecute a white-on-black crime. Only with the Rodney King case in California in 1993 did anyone seriously propose giving prosecutors a second bite at the apple after a state prosecution pursued in good faith before an ordinary jury ended in an unpopular acquittal. If the floodgates now open, how long before we see federal enforcers begin to second-guess state-court acquittals in, say, drug cases?
Others call for narrowing self-defense rights, though the Zimmerman case wound up being tried under pretty much the same self-defense standard that prevails in the great majority of states. Florida's so-called "stand your ground" law, which did away with the "duty to retreat," was ignored by both prosecution and defense, and the jury appeared to accept Zimmerman's contention that retreat was not an option for him once the altercation began.
A key constituency seeking to roll back stand your ground in the Florida legislature is prosecutors, whose interests just might not be fully congruent with those of the people they prosecute.
Although critics insist that stand your ground leads to racially disparate effects, the Tampa Bay Times, a paper that has been highly critical of the law, concedes its in-depth investigation "found no obvious bias in how black defendants have been treated" under the law.
It also quoted Alfreda Coward, a black Fort Lauderdale lawyer "whose clients are mostly black men," as saying it had sometimes worked to the advantage of her clients facing charges over altercations. "Let's be clear," Coward told the paper, "this law was not designed for the protection of young black males, but it's benefiting them in certain cases."
If you're looking for things that really went wrong in the Zimmerman case and are part of wider patterns unfavorable toward minorities, try looking at the prosecution's misdeeds.
In particular, Florida State Attorney Angela Corey overcharged, going for second-degree murder when even manslaughter was shaky. That didn't cow Zimmerman, who had a sizable legal defense fund, but such tactics work every day in extracting plea-bargain surrenders from ordinary-Joe defendants who fear a worse verdict.
Corey's team also tried the case in the news media, made jury-inflaming assertions it couldn't back up with proof, and (according to a whistle-blowing employee, soon fired by Corey) even withheld evidence from the defense side, an ethical breach should it be proven.
A public stirred up to outrage over sins like those might come to realize that they're not a fluke of the Zimmerman case, but crop up regularly in the everyday criminal justice system, to the disfavor of minority (and nonminority) defendants.
When the emotional grip of the moment has relaxed, we may wonder how we ever imagined that the way to help minorities in the justice system was to take away criminal defendants' rights.

This is their lives
I had just put down my lunch plate from the hotel buffet when the first siren went off. I never took a bite, and I am just realizing, I never paid either.We scrambled out onto the hotel restaurant's balcony, where we could see most of Haifa spread out down the hill below us.The scary thing about rocket strikes is that even with the siren sounding you can't see them coming. No streak of fire across the sky. Not a lot of sound. That is, not until the thump when it hits.This time, the thump was very close, and soon, a plume of thick white smoke started to rise. Within a few minutes, we jumped into our van and tore down the hill.The site was pure chaos -- filled with police, EMTs, onlookers, and of course, the throng of world press. Bullhorns were blasting and photographers snapped endlessly at the blast-splattered building.Then, just as we felt we had a grasp of the scene around us, the siren sounded again. The crowd went from pushing and shoving in the street to huddling together under any cover we could find.I found myself squeezed in a boarded-up shop doorway with a cop and a photographer. A second dull thud and a second sprint to the van. By then, we were all drenched in sweat. Summer in Israel really isn't body armor weather.This strike felt very different. The first rocket hit an unoccupied office building. This one hit a more residential neighborhood.I watched as the apartment building slowly started to catch fire. I saw a man holding a woman in the alley behind me. She was shaking violently in his arms as he tried to console her.I've never blogged before, so forgive me if this rambles. But as we rushed off to feed tape and throw the rest of our gear in the van to make the next flight to the next story, I am still thinking of that couple, people for whom this war isn't dramatic pictures and adrenaline.When the crowds leave the neighborhood, this tale won't be just another story running on tonight's news. For the countless innocent people in Israel and Lebanon, this is their lives.
Posted By Thomas Evans, CNN Producer: 2:43 PM ET 50 Comments Dear Mr. Evans.As a Muslim who lived in Haifa, I think it is absolutely terrific that you are making an effort to see what is really going on in this crazy region of the world. All we get in most media outlets are either stock of military operations or pictures of bombs going off from a long way away. it is nice to see somebody in journalism is actually there and witnessing these terrorist attacks first hand.It has become very en vogue as of recently to blame more developed and civilized countries for all the problems in the world. We're adopting a type of blame the victim mentality that is really upsetting. Instead of feeling sympathy for the Israeli civilians who are dealing with these constant attacks by a terrorist nation within a nation, the media seems instead to want to ignore it because of the relatively low loss of life. One country values the lives of their people enough that they provide bomb shelters and air raid warnings, go after kidnapped citizens, and attempt to create a safe buffer zone while the other seems to only care about inflicting as much carnage as possible. The Israeli's are using targeted weapons to attack legitimate military and terrorist targets while Hezbollah launchs unguided missiles at civilian cities in an attempt to cause as much murder as possible. And yet most people believe that Israel is the villian. It is simply baffling to me. The use of such rockets shows a distinct and murderous disregard for human life. They aren't targeting military infrastructure, i.e. power plants and airports, nor are they targeting military forces, instead they are just launching them at random against civilian populations.If Lebanon truly cared about the lives of their people, instead of parading there casualties around on network television, they would prevent them. Prime Minister Olmert has made it quite clear that this entire conflict would stop if they release the kidnapped Israelis, stop the terrorist rocket attacks, and deploy forces to keep the Hezbollah from starting another conflict. Right now Lebanon is only interested in being "right." Hezbollah launches its attacks from amongst civilian populations in order to use the Israeli's morality against them.It has been said about the Palestinian people but it is true also for the Lebonese it would appear: "The violen ce will only stop when they love their children more then they hate us." Please stop using innocent civilians as a shield and weapon, Hezbollah. Islam is the religion of peace, and you are making all of us Muslims look bad.

This was never 'just another story running on tonight's news'. Every one of those people walking dazed through an alley, exiting a burning building, lucky enough to survive, is family or friend to people around the world. Reporters can rush in and out for the story, but those left behind with damaged homes, damaged lives, are left to live it all over again the next day. This is their life, and I'm sure most of them wouldn't rather be anywhere else.
Posted By Josh, Boston, MA : 3:04 PM ET
Hey Anderson. I'm amazed that you can blog at all, let alone try to eat plus watch for mortor and mines. I'll bet you get some mean indigestion!! Please be extra careful you and your crew. You almost sound like you've bitten off more than you can chew. Knowing you though, it'll be come hell or high water(or guns, or mines, or whatever they have to dish out at you.Please you and your crew be extra safeand may God and CNN bless you allBev
Posted By bev Whitby, Ontario,CANADA : 3:05 PM ET
To the crew of 360:As indicated your coverage of the Middle East crisis is undoubtably nerve-racking and dangerous. Your coverage from deep in the region is, however, very much needed as it allows the world to first hand view what is happening in the region and not just hearing about it. It makes it real. Stay Safe
Posted By David Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada : 3:06 PM ET
For many of us these air strikes are simply political problems. It's too easy to forget that the homes, workplaces, and lives of people, people like us, are being destroyed. What we hear on today's news is forgotten by tomorrow.I pray that we are not on the brink of WWIII. Thank you for keeping us informed. Stay safe.
Posted By Sana A., Boca Raton, FL : 3:07 PM ET
That's nice.And is it any less terrorizing to Lebanese civilians who have no siren sounding, who can see the Israeli warplanes coming, with streaks of fire across the sky and a lot of sound, knowing you or a loved one will probably die from a no-less indiscriminate attack by Israel? And that there will be no "throng of world press", save Arab media, which the West will shrug off as biased.This is their lives.
Posted By John - Boston, MA : 3:12 PM ET
Anderson, when are you going to go to Lebannon and report from there? You have alot of fans in the USA that deserve to see both sides. In my opinion, it is unfair that any type of Arab or Iranian resistance is called terrorist and Israelli resistance is justified, even praised by our government in the U.S. What did Pres. Bush mean when he said that any nation is justified in defending itself from terrorists? Who are the terrorists? Aren't they everywhere? Aren't they the people that feel so justified in their beliefs and their land that they will do anything for it?? Hasn't Israel fallen into that category, along with other POWERFUL nations?
Posted By ST, STL, MO : 3:12 PM ET
Thanks to the entire 360 Crew for all their dedication and efforts to bring the stories back home into our living rooms. One can only imagine how all those people must feel that are impacted by this current Middle East Crisis. Let's just hope, for everyone's sakes, that there will be a cease fire soon and this madness will have an end. I hope all parties involved will show judgement enough to end this crisis.And you guys at CNN stay safe and don't take any risks. Everybody wants to see you all come home safe and in one piece!

I spent a year in DaNang Vietnam (68 & 69) and know these 122 mm rockets all to well. Your observations are correct. You don't know where they are going to hit since they can be just leaned against a mound of mud or said and launched with flashlight batteries. Yes, we had the sirens too and we would run for the bunkers (not the best idea) or usually, just lay flat on the gound. Your chances are better laying on the ground since they can hit very close to you if you are on the ground and you will survive. You mentioned the "thump" sound. They are not close. When they make more of a "crack" or "Whack" sound, it is time to start digging with your fingernails. I was in DaNang less than 12 hours when I experienced my first rocket attack. I know how you feel. I eventually got used to it but then, my best friend was hit by a rocket. That changes things.Anyway, stay put during an attack and lay flat. You will survive a hit 20 feet away (may bust your eardrums). Standing up and running, the shrapnel may kill you 100 feet or more away.August
Posted By August De Vico, Hillsborough, New Jersey : 3:12 PM ET
Neither Israel nor Hezbollah have the moral high ground on this conflict. Both have committed atrocities in the name of their own causes. They both antagonize one another (e.g., Israel regularly invades Lebanese airspace or bombs Hezbollah positions. In turn, Hezbollah reacts by firing rockets at Israeli planes, most of which miss their target and land in Israel, to which more military actions (by Israel) occur as a response). The Lebanese and Israeli people are both suffering. However, Israel, the more powerful of the two nations is systematically destroying Lebanon.

Sounds like a peice of text from a reporter during the bombing of The King David Hotel, that of course was 50 years ago and it seems "the more things change the more they stay the same". J.P.Naughton
Posted By J.P.Naughton New York City : 3:23 PM ET
Dear Mr. Evans:Congrats on your first blog! The life of a journalist/producer is very different. While others are running away from the bombs, you, Anderson and the 360 team are running towards them! Not two minutes ago I was complaining about the 100 degree heat in NJ and now I'm sitting here reading your account and thanking the good Lord that I'm not in your place. Too often, we take our life here in the States for granted. I wish peace for the all of the people in the Middle East. My prayers are with them today.Thank you for your update. Please stay safe over there. Annette
Posted By Annette LaCanna, Alpha, NJ : 3:25 PM ET
I love '360' because of stories like you just shared. Living in the United States and never having lived through any major tragedies, it is often hard for me to imagine how anyone can live through war year after year and still continue on with their lives. Thank you for sharing this with all of us and I hope you and everyone at CNN stays safe.
Posted By Kimberly Miller, Lancaster, PA : 3:26 PM ET
This is their lives, and the true shame is that only after 6 days the media seems to have lost focus of what the really is the crisis. **it happens right, people curse some more than others, but do I really need to hear about it each time I'm looking for fresh news trying to find out about these poor people and the terror that they must go through constantly. This very same lack of attention span was the subject of a totally different conversation at our Physics Library at SUNY Buffalo, however it had little to do with Lebanon, and we were speaking on out nation's lack of interest in the sciences. Truly the headline of this very website that I just accessed to post this comment is more than just a brief distraction; I believe it to be a microcosm of so much that has gone wrong with this world today. Here's to the people of the world who are so quickly forgotten, here's to peace in the east.
Posted By James Paul McMillan Buffalo NY : 3:27 PM ET
It is true that you dont realize what is going on - on that side of the world when you are reading about it on this website or watching it from the comfort of your living room. It is very upsetting to me that innocent people are getting caught up in a sensless war. I feel for that couple- I feel for anyone who is just trying to live their lives until it is interrupted by war. Thank you for reporting on this and risking your own life to get the truth out there. Be safe.
Posted By Krista, Cincinnati, Ohio : 3:28 PM ET
Taking 5 moments from my computer desk internship at Purdue University, I'm struck by Anderson's observations and recordings of the activities in Isreal. I can't even imagine what kind of disruption that must cause to life. I've never experienced it and hope I never have to. I couldn't dream what it would be like to possibly have your world over turned by a bomb or gunfire for political reasons or at all. I hate how desensitized we, as Americans, have become to violence that is not personal. My heart goes out to those experiencing loss and pain.After a weekend of wonderful experiences at my cousin's wedding, the only thing that was a pain to endure was the 95 degree heat and humidityin formal wear. And we weren't even wearing body armor.I give thanks.Keep up the reporting and showing the humanity behind the headlines.
Posted By Cait Tiller, Glenview, IL : 3:52 PM ET
More than half a century ago, Europe decided it would be an okay thing to do to steal Palestine from the Palestinians and give it to the Jews.And people are surprised that the Palestinians got mad? And that the rest of the Arabic-speaking world joined them in getting mad?Back then, the Western view of the heirs of the civilisation that saved Europe from barbarism a thousand years ago was one of condescending contempt. That still seems to be a popular view. But that view has led to what some commentators are calling the advent of World War III.On a personal level, I have enormous empathy for the individuals caught up in these events. They--Israelis, Lebanese, and Palestinians alike--are all victims. But they're not victims of each other, they're victims of past, present, and probably future Western meddling, of the Law of Unintended Consequences, of post WW II Western arrogance in deciding that they were entitled to draw the world's maps in any way they saw fit.
Posted By Henry Miller, Apex, NC : 3:52 PM ET
Just as it was the couple in the alley that made the story "human" for you, it is that story - the couple - that also engages the viewer. We have seen the bombs and explosions, just name the war or conflict, now let us see the people. It is not the adrenaline rush that engages a viewer but the humanness of the story. Stay safe.
Posted By Cassie Dallas,PA : 3:53 PM ET
Keep up the great work and reporting friend. We starve for first hand accounts like yours. I've been following some of the blog links from folks inside Lebanon and the raw nature of the reporting is truly captivating. Please stay safe and keep up the great work. As someone who has family in the region (Tel Aviv), and as one who has also been to Haifa and surrounding areas, I wish you and all other civilians the best in these trying times. There's an entire world of us online who are watching every minute of these developments. regards, --brian

It means the world to me that there are crews out there who truly care about unbiased, true reporting. I'm glad to say that you have provided more coverage of this conflict through being there than many others have provided throughout. May you be safe and may this end soon.

Excellent first blog, Thomas. You did a great job capturing the reality of the situation - all the people caught in the middle.
Posted By Rhonda, Chapel Hill, NC : 4:17 PM ET
Thank you for capturing the human dimension of this tragedy. It amazes me that some in the Arab world still haven't learned the childhood lesson that if you throw a stone at a beehive, expect to be stung (repeatedly). What other re-action was the media expecting from a sovereign nation (Israel) attacked by citizens (call them Hezballah if you will but they are Lebanese citizens who follow that ideology) from a neighboring nation (Lebanon), who cross the border to kill and kidnap? I'm only surprised that Israel has allowed those sworn to their destruction this much time to acquire long range missiles, and guess that this is the result of being lulled by people with good intentions from the West who said that if Israel withdrew from Lebanon and Gaza that all would be well.
Posted By David, Toronto, Ontario, Canada : 4:21 PM ET
While I run the risk of sounding redundant, I want to personally thank you for your obvious dedication to seeking the truth and ensuring that Americans are aware of it.Please stay safe and come home to your families...America cannot bear anymore casualties of another war that is not ours to fight.
Posted By Shannon, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania : 4:22 PM ET
There are people putting comments up trying to suggest a moral equivalence between Israel and Hizballah. I disagree. Looking at any conflict from a distance, it is human impulse to say -- "they are both in the wrong". However, Hizballah is a terrorist organization, as labeled by our government and the EU. It has killed more Americans (Beirut, Khobar Towers) than any terror organization save Al Qaeda. Whereas Israel seeks to attack combatants, Hizballah's entire purpose is to kill civilians. They are, as a senior US Gov't official put it, "The 'A-team' of terror." It is too bad for Israel: if they pull out from a territory, (such as they did in Gaza and Lebanon) their opponents simply use it as a "hudna" to arm themselves for the next attack on the Jews. If they go into the territory to clean up, then they are occupiers who offend Western liberals.
Posted By Brett, New York, NY : 4:27 PM ET
It puts such a human touch on the news to read the back-story. Too often we are desensitized to the real story by the constant barrage of pictures of suffering on television. To read a first hand account of someone covering the news helps to make it 'real' to us sitting in the comfort of our homes in the US.
Posted By Prentiss, Phoenix, AZ : 4:35 PM ET
Thank you for writing from the heart. I've been in and around the media for the last 20 years. There are some things that get through the armor that you put around yourself to get the job done.

I applaud Hamsah,I wish more muslims would speak out against terrorists and radicals that commit terrible acts in the name of Islam. I don't think view points will change for Islam until the non-radicals start speaking out against those that trash their religion for their own radical intentions.

As I've been following the news since the crisis began in the Lebanon, I am disheartened with destruction taking place. I agree with one of the other bloggers here regarding you moving into Lebanon and getting public opinion from the other side. I know that the situation there is very dangerous and fluid, but hope that you will eventually make it over there.Having had family visit Lebanon on a yearly basis over the last several years along with having some cousins and other relatives who live there, I know you will get an interesting view of what public opinion is over there. My sister was there last year and Israeli jets would scream over Beirut and other civilian areas at low altitudes on a regular basis to instill fear into the people.Here is another interesting statistic that I was reading in the news today..."Israel's campaign has killed 203 people, all but 13 of them civilians"...what is this false rhetoric about precision targeting?This is their lives...
Posted By HT, Los Angeles California : 5:06 PM ET
Thomas,It doesn't matter how well you do or don't "blog". It doesn't matter whether or not you use a lot of fancy terms and twists to your descriptions. What matters is getting the info to your readers and doing it in a way that they feel what you feel. As much as possible, anyway. I don't think someone who has nwver been in such a situation can ever know the fear, the smells, or the pain you see.Give my prayers and gratitude to your companions, tell them how brave I think they all are.Take care, Stay safe.Maggie
Posted By Maggie, Grain Valley, MO : 5:07 PM ET
I agree w/ New York Brett. Palestine's credo is "Israel does not have a right to exist". Israel on the other hand has never said that about Palestine.p.s. How would you react if someone said to you that you "don't have a right to exist?"

I'm glad this blog gives us the opportunity to hear from everyone connected with the show and their perspective on what's taking place. Very engrossing post, Thomas.
Posted By Fay, Vacaville, CA : 5:09 PM ET
Gilberto from LA has hit it right on the head. The attempt to justify either side's position as "moral high ground" is ridiculous. Furthermore the idea that the groups inside of Lebanon and Palestine are "terrorists" based on their tactics is silly. What about the Israeli death squads, the USA's atomic bomb drops... the boston tea party for christ's sake. Don't get me wrong, I don't agree with either side, but the holier than thou stuff is a bit tough to swallow. The truth is that to anyone with any sense of intelligence both sides are mad and destroying life after life in a primitive mindless exchange within a society that attempts to sell itself as civilized. I promise you, from someone who has lived in the region, and knows through blood both sides of the coin that this can only stop when the populas has had enough and pushes the maniacs on both sides of the fence into the sea. They're the same animal afterall.... just different head dress!
Posted By George Chicago, IL : 5:16 PM ET
Lebanon is to blame for all this by allowing the Muslim terrorist organizations to use them and their country to launch attacks against Israel. It doesn't matter whether Syria and Iran or anyone else was involved.If Lebanon wants to end this and evict the Muslim terrorists, they only have to ask Israel for their help.Otherwise, this response by Israel will not necessarily stop in a few days.Israel has lost all patience with terrorists that camp out next to their borders, and then sneak into their territory at night and kidnap their people.The Muslims of the World have to wake up!!! Every morning at your prayers you need to focus on just "Who are you praying to?" The terrorists are obviously praying to falsehoods. They are non-believers, or simply fools. I do not believe the terrorists represent a majority of the Muslim World.But just as Lebanon layed back, ignored the terrorist activities, and is now being blamed by the victims, so this will happen to the truely innocent Muslims of the World.The World has lost all patience with terrorists.

Well we see the results of the "civilized west" supporting the zionists from eastern europe to invade, rob, kill qnd expell some nine million Palestinians. The only thing that will stop this now is a one state democracy in all of Palestine: return and restitution for all victims, one man one vote, equal rights for all and NO religion in government.
Posted By Lawrence, London UK : 5:35 PM ET
Dear all,you are obviously ignoring what is really going on in Lebanon. Unfortunately those people that you call terrorists are desperate in order to defend their land and don�t possess the sophisticated weapons the "oh so poor" Israelis do.Just wake up and realise that the holocaust has been over for a while now and it is weak to still use it as a means to make everyone pitty them for what happened! Come on people take a look at what is happening around you, stand up for the real victims and instead of supporting the massacres israel is performing condemn them! They are destroying the whole infrastructure of a city and seclude innocent citizens from the world like cattle. Now, tell me in this whole war, who is the real victim? Dare to dig deeper into the problem and LOOK at both sides...unless you are israeli of course!
Posted By Stefanie W., Salzburg, Austria : 5:35 PM ET
It would be nice if you could report from Lebenon so that you can report how Israel is bombing that country back to the stone ages. The affect on the Lebonese is far worse than it is on the Israelis. I am embarrassed by my country's response to this over-reaction by Israel.
Posted By Shelly, Atlanta GA : 6:13 PM ET
I'm a Lebanese. Lebanon is not a country or people but a number ofcountries and peoples squeezed together into on of the smallestterritories of the world. Most Lebanesewith some Shi'ites includedhold a grudge against Hizbollah, its bombast and repressionist policy against other Lebanese, and makingLebanon a hostage to its Iranian/Syrian agenda. These guys simply won't cooper-ate with other factions to rebuild the country and make it prosper again. Theyhold their military parades, have their own state within a state, andare bankrolled by Iran. It was abouttime that they get humiliated as much as they humiliated other Lebanese

It's not an overreaction by Israel at all.In my opinion, what they are doing is not enough.They need to take out Iran and Syria too.Now can they? I don't know.But those 2 countries are mostly responsible for the worlds problems.
Posted By Newark,nj : 9:46 AM ET
Newark, you hit the nail right on the head.. With a very large sledge hammer perhaps.. but very accurate. It is heart wrenching to see the destruction in Lebanon. Lebanon is a beautiful place with great people. It is very unfortunate for the Lebanese people that they do not have the power to expel Iran's puppet army, Hezbolla, by themselves. The Majority of Lebanese do not want a war with Israel. They recognize Israel's right to exist and want to live their lives in peace. As does Israel.Iran and Syria, on the other hand, want the destruction of Israel. The real criminals here are Iran and Syria. What we are seeing here is Israel's attempt to convince ALL of the Lebanese people that, to allow a terror group like Hezbolla to operate,and kill Israelis, within it's borders will cost,,,,, ALOT. It is sad to see the Lebanese people suffer for the actions of Iran. Iran could care less if Israel destroyed all of Lebanon. Iran is playing a dangerous chess game using so called freedom fighters as pawns in other countries to start conflicts so that the world's attention is not focused on their atomic program that Pakistan and China supplied all the technology and material for. And it is the Lebanese that are paying for it this time. Usually it is the Palestinians.
Posted By Robert, Cotati, CA : 2:42 PM ET
Dear Mr. Evans,Your first blog ever, and look at all the criticism and discussion you've encouraged! I want to congratulate you on the highly descriptive, riveting and heart wrenching use of language you have displayed. It takes us directly to the center of the conflict, and helps to understand what is exactly going on without leaving the comfort of our living rooms. it's only too bad that the people of both israel and lebanon do not have such a luxury. i find it so disturbing that after so many efforts to deliver peace to this region it should only lead back to this violence. The same old problems that have plagued the Middle East for thousands of years, or at least since Israel was formed, will probably never be resolved at this rate, but at least i have the ability to turn off the TV, or walk away from the internet, and know that my living room will be in the same state i left it in when i get back..albeit a warzone in and of itself. My last thought, grossly unoriginal-i give you that-but relevant nonetheless, is if only women were in control of this region of the world...i think we are much better at negotiating compromises. After all, it's what we are taught to do at a very young age, even in this day and age and even the women brought up in that region of the world. I know, because some of my women friends are both Arabic and Jewish, and actually from Lebanon and Israel, and I don't think any of them, suppposing for a minute they were politicians, would consider this a viable option guaranteed with certain success. It's total madness, smelling suspiciously like over-exuberent testosterone and malicious male pride.Good luck in Lebanon, Thomas Evans.....i hope all of you return home to the safety of your New York apartments soon.

Hi, this brings back memories of when I worked at the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia some many years ago. During my short tour, there were nights that I layed awake and heard incoming rockets going over my house. But the saying is, if you hear them coming, not to worry. It's the one that you don't hear that will get you. : )The next morning after the nightly rocket attacks I did see big chunks of shrapnel laying in the street on my way to work, but my guardian Angel must have kept them out of my yard.Thanks for taking my call.
Posted By Rollo Rogers, San Diego, CA : 5:09 PM ET
Just a comment to Adele from Gothenburg: you mentioned in your comment that "The same old problems that have plagued the Middle East for thousands of years, or at least since Israel was formed, will probably never be resolved at this rate." Pessimism over this seemingly irresolvable conflict is pretty common. Despite the dark times that have descended upon the region in recent years, I don't believe that this conflict is irresolvable for the following reasons: 1). I lived in Arab East Jerusalem and Bethlehem for four months two years ago. I also spent some time in Nazareth, Tel Aviv, Haifa and some other places in Northern Israel. I have interacted with Jews, Muslims and Christians on both sides of the conflict in that land. I heard a lot about "the Situation" from many. My conclusions were these: the conflict is being fueled by a small minority of bloodthirsty extremists on both sides who are utterly unwilling to compromise at all. On the other hand, both Israeli and Palestinian society are very fractured, riven by factions and internal conflicts. Not all Israelis or Palestinians see eye to eye with the wild-eyed nutters on their respective sides. In fact, most of both are just normal people that want to live in peace and be left alone to make a living and raise their families unmolested. The fact of the matter is, there is ALREADY peace in many parts of Israel and the Occupied Territories. Israelis and Palestinians in many parts of the country alread work peacefully side by side, have friendships that cross the line, depend on each other economically to run their business (in such a small country as Israel, it cannot be otherwise; people HAVE to depend on each other to make it, like it or not). I worked as a volunteer for a summer camp in Northern Israel two years ago. The campers were both Messianic Jewish teenagers and Israeli Arab/Palestinian Christian teenagers. They had their issues, of course, relating to "the Situation," but on the whole, they got along really pretty well. These same kids belong to a youth group that meets regularly throughout the year. 2). When I lived in Israel, I met two guys from Belfast in Northern Ireland. One of them was first a bus-driver along Shankill Road (the road that separates the Catholic and Protestant sides of the city), then a bus inspector back in the '70s and '80s, when the Troubles were at their worst. He told me that the Troubles was actually WORSE than the current Arab-Israeli conflict: bloodier, more vicious, and charged with mutual seething hate. I personally never expected to see an end to that conflict in my lifetime. Yet, we have begun to see that very thing. If the Northern Irish can do it, I believe the Palestinians and Israelis can do it too. Unfortunately, it will take years of what we're seeing now before both sides finally gets religion on this and puts an end to it. Nonetheless, I think it can happen.
