Palin draws Democrats with rallying cryStory Highlights V-P candidate Sarah Palin pulling in Republican crowds in battleground state Virginia Republican Virginians say John McCain can still take state despite trailing in polls Palin supporters cite her honesty, straight-talking as her most appealing traits Palin vows to shake up Washington, clean up Wall Street, win war in Iraq Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO PHOTOS INTERACTIVE By CNN's Simon Hooper	FREDERICKSBURG, Virginia (CNN) -- Lula Easterling and her friend Bill Hardenburgh have voted Democrat all their lives. But browsing through a pile of Sarah Palin t-shirts, baseball caps and other merchandise as they wait to gain access to the Republican vice-presidential candidate's campaign rally in Fredericksburg, the pair admit next week they will be casting their votes elsewhere. Palin supporters braved chilly conditions and heavy rains to greet the Republican vice-presidential candidate.more photos » "We're here to show our support for John McCain and Sarah Palin," Easterling tells me. "We like their strategy on the economy and everything they say. He's an honest man, he doesn't lie and she's the same." Most of all though, Easterling doesn't like Barack Obama. "I'm scared to death of him," she admits. "I'm scared of what he stands for, the whole nine yards. He hangs with the terrorists and he lies. He never tells the truth and he's a flip-flopper. He's not to be trusted." Hardenburgh meanwhile has picked out a badge featuring a mocked-up image of a stars-and-stripes bikini-clad Palin wielding a rifle with the slogan "Caribou Barbie Shoot First!" "That's what I like about her, right there," he says, pinning it to his Harley Davidson jacket. A small town halfway between Washington DC and Richmond that was the focus of a series of bloody battles during the American Civil War, Fredericksburg and its citizens wear their history, an unselfconscious patriotism and an almost pathological suspicion of "big government" proudly. Follow the campaign trail in Virginia » And while Obama and his supporters may have ambitions of carrying Virginia for the Democrats for the first time in more than four decades, on the evidence of the 6,000 or so people who waited for hours and braved a freezing rainstorm to hear Palin speak -- one of three campaign stops by the Alaskan governor across the state Monday -- Republicans have no intention of surrendering without a fight. "Keep Virginia Red," reads one of dozens of banners capturing the mood of the audience. Watch Palin supporters rally in Virginia Don't Miss Virginia holds keys to White House
Battle for Virginia shifts to getting voters to the polls
"I love Sarah Palin. She's just like I am. She's a straight talker. You may not agree with what she has to say but she's going to tell you the truth," says government employee Jeanette Montoya. "I hope she gets in there and takes out the trash." See photos of McCain-Palin supporters » Taking a prompt from one of Palin's unofficial campaign slogans -- "Drill Baby Drill!" -- Montoya cites rising fuel costs and American dependency on foreign oil supplies as her principal concerns: "I want them to start drilling in Alaska. I want them drilling in South Dakota, North Dakota and everywhere there's oil." Merle Fallon, a 62-year-old attorney and Vietnam veteran -- one of many ex-servicemen in the crowd -- professes admiration for McCain and Palin and believes the election race is far from decided. "I think a lot of people will have to walk into the polling booth to make a decision and hopefully they'll make the right one. It would be terrible if the Democrats were to control the House, the Senate and the Presidency." Speaking under ominous skies that quickly spill open into a downpour that leaves her soaked but her folksy enthusiasm undimmed -- "By the way, I love this weather because it reminds me of home." -- Palin's message is blunt, unequivocal and ideally pitched to an audience that requires less convincing on policy issues than reassurance that they are still in the game and in with a shouting chance. "You can do the math or you can go with your gut but you can make your own decision. Barack Obama will take your money and give it to someone else according to his priorities... We're all Joe the Plumber now," she says of Obama's tax plans -- prompting dozens of "I'm Joe the Plumber" signs to be brandished enthusiastically. "You betcha!" she adds with a practised flourish. "If you're ready to shake up Washington, clean up Wall Street, and if you're ready to get our economy back on track and you want to win the war in Iraq then Virginia we're after your votes... We are the people who will work for you. So, Virginia, will you hire us?" Maintaining a low key presence among the hockey moms, Obama supporter Eileen Limas, a 43-year-old martial arts instructor from nearby Stafford, is worried. She says she has come down to witness the "Palin phenomenon" at close hand. "She's not my role model. I don't identify with her. And it scares me because I feel she's not going away -- win or lose," says Limas. "She will go back, she will educate herself on things and re-tool herself and she is going to be around a while. I think she is going to be a substantial political player for the Republicans for a long time to come."

Commentary: Obama summons ghosts of American historyStory Highlights Paul Begala: Obama's speech was a brave and bracing departure He says Obama showed belief in realism and his faith we can overcome problems Begala: He evoked ghosts of American history, who would approve He says Obama symbolizes American dream of remarkable achievement Next Article in Politics » By Paul Begala CNN Contributor Editor's note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. Paul Begala says Obama embodies the American dream, and our fate is now tied to his fate. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sometimes pictures tell a story better than words. On Inauguration Day, we saw Barack Obama, strong and certain, striding purposefully into the presidency. And we saw Dick Cheney, once one of the most powerful people on Earth, reduced to being wheeled out of the White House. Of course, we all wish good health for the former vice president, but the contrasting images were stark. Barack Obama's inaugural address was a bracing, brave break with the past. "On this day," he said, "we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics." He sternly scolded the "greed and irresponsibility" of our current era, and called for "action, bold and swift." Take that, George W. Bush, whose false promises and worn-out dogmas have turned so much of the nation against him. Barack Obama's story is unique in its particulars, but it is universal in its appeal. One grandfather a Kenyan goat herder who opposed colonial rule, the other a Kansas farm boy who joined Patton's army to fight the Nazis. His parents' marriage was illegal in 16 states, and his mother struggled, turning to food stamps to keep body and soul together, and waking young Barry up at 4:30 in the morning to nourish his brain. He understands and appreciates the American Dream because he is its living embodiment. His story is our story. And now his fate and ours are inextricably intertwined. Don't Miss Commentary: Obama the kind of hero we need now
Commentary: What Obama's "best" should know
In Depth: Commentaries
As a speechwriter, I know you say a lot in the quotations you choose. President Barack Obama chose two and he chose wisely. First, St. Paul's letter to the Corinthians in which he exhorts the people of Corinth to, in effect, grow up. "When I was a child," Paul wrote, "I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, and reasoned like a child. But when I became a man I put aside childish things." The new president used that ancient letter to deliver a badly needed message after eight years of anything goes: Put your big-boy pants on, America. The president closed by quoting the words from Tom Paine that Gen. Washington ordered read aloud at Valley Forge. "Let it be told to the future world," Washington said, "that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]." The quote shows Obama's belief in unflinching courage, unblinking realism and an unrelenting faith that by coming together we Americans can bend history to our will. Of course, even as Washington words echoed, other ghosts of American history were milling about. Abe Lincoln prowled the Mall. FDR, his ever-present cigarette holder clenched in his smiling teeth, cheered zestily. Dr. King called out from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and John F. Kennedy called back to him from the steps of the Capitol. When Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech in 1963, President Kennedy watched it on TV from the White House. As King concluded, Kennedy said, "He's good. He's damn good." I like to think that as Barack Obama concluded his inaugural address, Dr. King turned to President Kennedy and said, "This young man's pretty damn good, too." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.

General: Iran won't return U.S. drone it claims to have
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 2:40 PM EST, Mon December 12, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
General: "No one sends back the spying equipment and its information back"
Iran says it downed an American drone on December 4
The Pentagon says it lost contact with a drone and has not recovered it
U.S. officials say it was part of an Afghan mission (CNN) -- Iran will not return an unmanned American stealth plane that it says it has, one of Iran's top generals said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency on Sunday.
"No nation welcomes other countries' spy drones in its territory, and no one sends back the spying equipment and its information back to the country of origin," said Gen. Hossein Salami, deputy commander of the Armed Forces.
"It makes no difference where this drone originated and which group or country sent it to invade our air space," Salami said. "This was an act of invasion and belligerence."
American officials have not confirmed that the drone in a video released Thursday is a U.S. aircraft, but Pentagon spokesman George Little has said that an American drone is missing and had not been recovered as of Thursday.
But two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that the missing drone was part of a CIA reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in Afghanistan.
Iran's official Iran Republic News Agency said the country's armed forces had downed the drone near Kashmar, some 225 kilometers (140 miles) from the border with Afghanistan on December 4.
Salami said downing the plane was "very valuable for us" and "a victory for us and a defeat for our enemies," IRNA reported.
He also claimed Iran had downed other drones earlier but had not announced those instances because they were not as important.
Iranian TV aired images Thursday of what it says is the drone, an apparently intact RQ-170 drone propped on a pedestal and triumphantly displayed.
There was disagreement among Pentagon officials about whether the drone in the video was real. Military and intelligence officials were analyzing the Iran television footage.
One U.S. official said the United States can't be certain it's the real stealth drone, because U.S. personnel don't have access to it. But he added there's no reason to think it's a fake.
However, a second senior U.S. military official said that a big question is to how the drone could have remained virtually intact given the high altitude it is believed to have crashed from.
The condition of the drone in the video suggests it was not shot down but suffered a system failure, aviation analyst Bill Sweetman said. There are no burn marks from a fire, no holes and no outward damage. Sweetman noticed a dent along the leading edge but doesn't know what that means.
"It's fairly clear here from the pictures that the outer wings have been separated. The question is, did that happen in the accident or (did they take) them off to move the aircraft?" Sweetman asked.
The CIA and the Pentagon would not comment on the video shown Thursday.
A senior U.S. official with direct access to the assessment about what happened to the unmanned aircraft said it was tasked to fly over western Afghanistan and look for insurgent activity, with no directive either to fly into Iran or spy on Iran from Afghan airspace.
A U.S. satellite quickly pinpointed the downed drone, which apparently sustained significant damage, the senior official said.
Iran's U.N. ambassador said in a letter Thursday that the drone flew 250 kilometers (150 miles) into Iranian territory "to the northern region of the city of Tabas."
The letter from Ambasador Mohammad Khazaee to U.N. Secretary-Genera Ban Ki-moon and the heads of the General Assembly and Security Council said the drone "faced prompt and forceful action" by the armed forces.
"My government emphasizes that this blatant and unprovoked air violation by the United States government is tantamount to an act of hostility against the Islamic Republic of Iran in clear contravention of international law, in particular, the basic tenets of the United Nations Charter," Khazaee's letter said.
He called for U.N. condemnation of U.S. "acts of aggression," as well as "clear and effective measures to be taken to put an end to these dangerous and unlawful acts in line with the United Nations' responsibilities to maintain international and regional peace and security."
Journalist Shirzad Bozorgmehr and CNN Pentagon Correspondent Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.

Bear Grylls survives new book
By Mike Ayers, Special to CNN
updated 1:12 PM EDT, Wed May 9, 2012
Bear Grylls has a new book out and a series of commercials.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Survivalist Bear Grylls has released his autobiography
He is best known for hosting the series "Man vs. Wild"
Grylls said he's working on some new upcoming shows
(CNN) -- Best known for hosting Discovery Channel's enormously popular series "Man vs. Wild," British extreme adventurist Bear Grylls recently released his autobiography, "Mud, Sweat & Tears."
The book is essentially the story of how Grylls became the grub eating, naturalist risk taker that has captivated a global audience. The chapters are short and punchy; rarely do they go over three pages and Grylls opens up about his formative years growing up on the Isle of Wight, his time spent at boarding schools and in the SAS (the British Special Air Service), his inabilities to woo girls and his recovery from a parachuting accident that left his back broken.
Earlier this year, Grylls and Discovery failed to come to contract agreements, so at the moment he's currently searching for a new television project. Meanwhile he's enjoying a bit of success for his appearances in a series of Degree deodorant commercials.
CNN recently spoke with Grylls in New York as he was preparing for a book signing.
CNN: Everyone knows about the extreme conditions you put yourself through. Do you write in extreme conditions?
Grylls: No, I didn't want to be away filming, then get home and be a dad and be writing. So I made a rule: I would only write on flights. And I had a load of those. Maybe 18 months on a plane. So I didn't write at home; I need every sense and focus when I'm there.
CNN: But it was at a high altitude, just a little more contained.
Grylls: (Laughs) Yeah. When you're out there, you need every sense of your body working for you. That's why I'm always exhausted at the end of those days. You don't have time for anything like that.
CNN: At this point for you, which is harder for you: surviving a publisher deadline or surviving deadly conditions?
Grylls: Well, the deadlines aren't going to kill you. I don't adhere strictly to deadlines -- writing ones. It's always going to be delayed because stuff takes longer ... I always figure no rush. I take the deadly deadlines more serious than the publisher's deadlines.
CNN: The first third of the book, you discuss your formative years. You seem like a pretty well-adjusted guy. No rebellious drug phase or dark Goth phase.
Grylls: I think there was more stumbling than that, but I was focused. I found at a young age that I could do well at what I loved.
CNN: In the early chapters, it becomes evident that you're not self-conscious about your body. In fact, you seem to generally okay with getting naked.
Grylls: Yeah, I grew up on an island so for me, I was always running around naked. Still am when I'm around good friends. I loved it in my workouts in the morning, at dawn, without any clothes on, doing pull ups on the bar. I loved that. Obviously on the show, you're always getting naked diving in the water, but the truth is, however many days of filming, I'm going to get my skivvs off and have a wash.
But they always film that and that's out of my control. I'm usually naked for about 3 minutes over four days, but that happens to be 3 minutes of the show. It's a little bit harsh, but when I'm relaxed and with friends and stuff, I'm always skinny dipping in the sea. I love all of that.
CNN: You also detail your time spent in the SAS and British Army -- did you identify more with the idea behind the SAS or more of the physical aspects of it?
Grylls: I always loved the ethos there. The regiment of character of the individual. There was something I loved about that. You could be a scruff, but everybody was encouraged to have peers and you've got be able to laugh at yourself and work under pressure with each other and not have an ego. Those sort of things mattered. The unofficial motto is the "the regiment, the misfits working together."
CNN: You discuss the parachuting accident that you had where you broke your back. Were you classified as depressed during that time?
Grylls: People said you must've been positive to go through a broken back but the truth was it wasn't like that. It was a very dark time with struggle and doubt. I think the hard thing for me was not knowing. None of the doctors could tell me if I would walk properly again or climb properly again. I realized I could determine what was best for me and that's why I chose (to climb) Mount Everest as the goal. People looked at me like I was crazy, but the staff at the rehab center knew the power of a dream and having a focus like that.
CNN: Watching your shows and reading your book, there's the idea that you don't need a lot of modern technology to live. What are your thoughts on that? Are we too reliant on technology these days?
Grylls: Technology is great; it allows me to communicate with my family when I'm in remote areas. But the downside is that it disempowers people to display skills that without technology they could depend on for their life. So I think the key is to still having those skills, but using technology to help you.
You always got to plan for the worst and hope for the best. If the GPS isn't going to work, if the lifeboat isn't going to work, you still got to know how to navigate across the mountains, across the bridges. Skills like that are very natural and basic to learn. It'll surprise you. I've taken people out who have more money than the world and they start smiling when they make their own fire. It's deep inside thousands and thousands of years in our psyche. It's the best free entertainment you can get. It's the natural world. Technology is great but it's never going to be as much fun as creating something out of nothing.
CNN: Are you working on any shows for this year or next?
Grylls: Yeah, well we're kind of offers and ideas coming in at the moment. We're just trying to be smart and wise. Definitely making programs that are about adventure and empowering people. That's been the driving force for me in the TV side of my life.

(CNN) -- Andy Murray became the first British man to win a Grand Slam final since Fred Perry in 1936 after defeating Novak Djokovic in the final of the U.S. Open.
The Scot even surrendered a two-set lead during a five-set thriller that lasted almost five hours, before he regained his focus to win 7-6 (12-10) 7-5 2-6 3-6 6-2 in swirling winds at Flushing Meadows.
It proved to be fifth time lucky for the Olympic champion, who -- like his coach Ivan Lendl -- had lost his previous four Grand Slam finals.
Murray will now replace the injured Rafael Nadal as world No.3 in the official men's rankings.

2012 U.S. Open Men's Final
With his support team in New York swelled by fellow celebrity Scots, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and actor Sean Connery, the 25 year old singled out Lendl, a three-time U.S. Open champion, for praise.
Fred Perry, winner of all four Grand Slams, poses with his trophy on September 12, 1936, after winning the men's singles against Donald Budge at what was then called the U.S. Championships. Not for another 76 years would another British man, Andy Murray, win a Grand Slam title. CNN looks at other momentous events that happened in 1936.

German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler violates the Locarno Pact and the Treaty of Versailles on March 7, 1936, by sending German forces, seen here receiving flowers by well-wishers, to the demilitarized Rhineland.
April 19, 1936, marks the first day of the Great Uprising in Palestine. Begun as a general strike, the protest against Jewish immigration into Palestine -- and for national independence -- led to British troops, such as those pictured manning an armored train, being sent to keep order.
A group of soldiers from the army of Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) is pictured with reinforced shields and rifles during the war with Mussolini-led Italy. Italy would take Addis Ababa and annex Abyssinia on May 9, 1936, after its emperor, Haile Selassie, flees.

1936 in photos: When last British man won
"He was one of the greatest," Murray said. "He has helped me through the tough times as have all of my team. It's the best feeling for me, I've had an unbelievable summer."
Can Murray win first tennis grand slam?
Murray put the bitter disappointment of losing this year's Wimbledon final against Roger Federer behind him by taking the Gold medal at the London Olympics at the Swiss star's expense -- a result many believed could be a turning point in the Dunblane-born star's Grand Slam fortunes.
Andy Murray carries the Olympic torch But it was never going to be easy on Monday night.
After narrowly losing the first two sets, Djokovic proved why he was the 2011 champion in New York, as he battled back to take the third and fourth sets with apparent ease as far as the scoreboard was concerned -- but in reality both players fought tooth and nail for every single point.
Though the momentum appeared to be with Djokovic, Murray refused to give up and summoned his earlier verve and aggression to put his visibly tiring opponent on the back foot once again.
Federer reflects on Wimbledon win
Not even a late pause for treatment on the Serb's cramping leg could prevent Murray from closing in on the prize British tennis has coveted for 76 years, much to the delight of the crowd inside the cavernous Arthur Ashe Stadium.
Wimbledon: Murray fans disappointed
When the final shot of the match -- a rasping forehand from Djokovic -- went long, Murray was left visibly stunned by his achievement. But he had finally overcome lingering doubts about his mental fortitude when it mattered most.
Despite his own disappointment, Djokovic was quick to pay pay tribute to his great friend and rival.
"It wasn't to be and I want to congratulate Andy on a first Grand Slam. He deserves it," said the Serbian.
"I tried my best and I gave it my all. It was another tremendous match and I am proud to have been part of it. It went to the last moment."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Catalans go to the polls on Sunday November 25 in a vote that trigger a referendum for independence
Catalonia is home to tourist attractions -- Barcelona Football Club and the Gaudi House Museum The CiU is raising the debate on sovereignty at a time of public frustration over taxes in Catalonia
London (CNN) -- It's September 11, 2012. The National Day of Catalonia. And an estimated 1.5 million people are on the streets of Barcelona waving banners "Catalonia -- The next state in Europe" and "Independencia."
Separatist Catalans are calling for sovereignty from Madrid and the rule of the conservative Popular Party, led by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.
Losing 20% of the economy is the last thing the Spanish government needs right now. But if those calling for independence get their way, that could be exactly what happens when Catalans go to the polls this weekend.
Catalonia -- a region in the northeast of Spain and home to global brands and tourist attractions including Barcelona Football Club and the Gaudi House Museum -- represents one fifth of the Spanish economy.
The Catalonia issue comes at an inconvenient time for Rajoy's government, which opposes any talk of independence. Spain, part of the eurozone mainstay, is grappling with unsustainable borrowing costs and a soaring public deficit while trying to placate public anger over a lack of jobs and stringent austerity.
Out of the hardship, regional disputes in northern Spain have started to resurface, particularly in Catalonia. Economists at Deutsche Bank say the political turmoil in such a prosperous region could be the catalyst that forces the Spanish central government into seeking aid from Europe's permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.
As the industrial heartbeat of the eurozone's fourth largest economy, Catalonia is the most important economic region in Spain. Situated on the Mediterranean and bordering France, the area is home to seven million people and made up of four provinces: Barcelona, Lleida, Tarragona and Girona.
Calls for independence
Cashing in on reusable diapers
The debate over Catalan independence is not new. Strained tensions between Madrid and Catalonia have been around for centuries.
Spain's indebted regions
But Salvador Giner, sociologist and president of the Intitut d'Estudis Catalans, told CNN the vehemence of the debate fluctuates depending on the political and economic zeitgeist.
Spanish protesters gather at courthouse
Artur Mas, head of the Catalan government, has announced a snap regional election on November 25. If his nationalist CiU party win, a referendum on Catalan independence is expected to follow shortly after, according to Gilles Moec, co-head of European economic research at Deutsche Bank.
Giner told CNN that a victory for Mas and CiU should be considered a certainty. He said: "The socialist party in Catalonia is in disarray. He [Mas] knows that he'll win hands down."
However, Xavier Sala-i-Martin, a professor in economics at Columbia University, says that Mas is simply "following the crowd" on calls for sovereignty.
He said: "Up until September 11 his strategy was to go to Madrid and ask for a better financial deal or "fiscal pact" as he called it. I guess that the massive demonstrations convinced him that his people no longer want a better financial deal from Spain. They want independence. And he joined the bandwagon... Mas doesn't lead. He follows."
Catalonia's nearby regions, the Basque country, and Galicia in the Northwest of Spain also have self-governance mandates under the Spanish Constitution of 1978. And while not wholly independent from Spanish state law, they are still considered autonomous.
On October 21, both the Basque country and Galicia held regional elections. Rajoy received a boost in his home region of Galicia where his centre-right party won a majority of the parliamentary seats against two nationalist groups and a socialist party. The win represented support for Rajoy's government as it tries to reduce Spain's deficit through a rigorous austerity program.
The Basque elections presented a very different outcome. The nationalist party -- known as PNV [Partido Nacionalista Vasco] won 27 seats while the pro-independence party, Bildu, secured 21 and Rajoy's Popular Party won just 10 seats of the 75.
Spain protests turn violent For over 50 years, the Basque region was home to a paramilitary group known by the acronym "ETA" and in English "Basque Homeland and Freedom."
Does Spain need a bailout?
The terrorist group -- formed in 1958 -- carried out a number of attacks on Spanish citizens in the name of sovereignty and but declared a permanent cease-fire last year. Giner says their activities failed to help the Basque country's cause and he would like to see Catalan independence achieved peacefully.
Spain's Red Cross focuses on unemployed
He told CNN: "I believe full sovereignty for Catalonia is absolutely possible and we can achieve this in a civilized manner, without the use of terrorist groups."
Spain's austerity drive
Today, Spain is suffering. The Madrid-based Popular Party is introducing deeply unpopular policies. These include a fiscal cocktail of severe budget cuts and rising taxes on a population already afflicted by the highest rate of unemployment in Europe at 25.1%, according to Eurostat figures.
The CiU is raising the debate on sovereignty at a time of public frustration over taxes in Catalonia. Moec said in a note that the CiU blames the central government for disproportionate taxes levied at Catalans -- with the wealth then re-distributed to Spain's poorer regions.
Salvador Giner says he understands the need for Spanish solidarity and to help struggling regions, but says a large proportion of the revenue generated from taxes is not being reinvested in Catalonia.
He added: "Catalans are fed up with the current situation on taxes. Catalonia gets back only about 19% to 21% of our contribution to the central government."
According to Sala-i-Martin, taxes and regional distribution of wealth are a large part of the problem for Catalans -- but the biggest tensions are steeped in the country's modern history.
Catalonia's past
After the country's military dictator, Franco, died in 1975, Catalans thought that they could be part of a country that recognized its different cultures, languages and nations, Sala-i-Martin said. Initially, that looked possible.
But then: "In 1981, after the military coup attempt, the monster woke up," the Columbia professor added. "All the Spanish institutions reinterpreted the constitution in ways that did not allow Catalunya to feel comfortable within that country."
In 2010, the Spanish constitutional courts ruled that although the term "nation" could be applied to Catalonia, the description had no legal validity.
The recession and financial crisis of 2008 then exacerbated the tensions between Catalonia and Madrid, Sala-i-Martin said.
This forced the Catalan administration to make a plea to the central government in Madrid for a regional bailout of five billion euros from an 18 billion euro credit line set up for debt-ridden Spanish regions.
Employment in Catalonia is also causing a political headache for the CiU and the national governing Popular Party. According to a report by the Organization of Cooperation and Development [OECD], unemployment in Catalonia has jumped by 8.6% to 16.3%, since the collapse of the housing market and the global financial crisis began in 2008.
Salvador Giner says the unemployment rate is in part due to immigrants -- largely from Southern Spain and North Africa -- settling in the region. The situation has been aggravated by an extended period of low economic growth.
The Catalan people are becoming steadily disillusioned with the economic management from Madrid, says Sala-i-Martin. He said: "If Spain came back today with an offer to solve the financial problems, most Catalans would still like to be given the right to vote for independence."

Obama: No sign Petraeus scandal hurt national security
By Gabriella Schwarz, CNN
updated 3:03 AM EST, Thu November 15, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: President Obama expects immigration bill to be introduced after inauguration
Obama offered fierce defense of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice over Benghazi comments
Obama said unaware of any disclosure from Petraeus scandal that could harm national security
President opened door to compromise regarding the impending fiscal cliff Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday he was unaware of any disclosure of classified information from the scandal engulfing former CIA Director David Petraeus and Gen. John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, that could damage national security.
"I have no evidence at this point from what I've seen that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security," Obama said in his first post-election news conference.
Obama, addressing the ongoing controversy for the first time publicly, said Petraeus tendered his resignation because his actions "did not meet the standards he felt were necessary as the director of the CIA."
The former four-star general admitted last Friday that he had had an extramarital affair with a woman who was later identified as a co-author of his biography.

Obama: 'Outrageous' to sully Rice's name
McCain, Graham after Susan Rice on Libya
The FBI is also investigating Allen over his contacts with another woman whose complaints about anonymous, harassing e-mails led to the discovery of the Petraeus affair.
When asked if he should have known about the investigation into his former CIA chief earlier, the president said he is "withholding judgment" because all of the information is not yet available.
"I'm going to wait and see ... how this whole process unfolded," Obama added.
The scandal has threatened to complicate Obama's focus on critical negotiations with Congress over spending cuts and taxes.
It has also raised questions surrounding the CIA's response to congressional inquiries into the September terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
On that matter, Obama offered a fierce defense of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who has come under scrutiny for public comments in the days following the attack in which she placed blame for it on a mob enraged by an anti-Muslim video.
The president said Rice was speaking with the information provided by the intelligence community and has acted with "skill, professionalism, toughness and grace."
In response to statements Wednesday from Sen. John McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said they would block a potential Rice nomination for a Cabinet position, Obama said if the lawmakers want to "go after somebody, they should go after me. I'm happy to have that discussion with them."
"For them to go after the U.N. ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received, and besmirch her reputation is outrageous," he said.
On another pressing foreign policy issue, Obama said he was not ready to arm the Syrian opposition movement, saying that the nation needed to avoid indirectly providing weapons to groups or people who would seek to harm Americans or Israelis.
The United States is supporting a new coalition of Syrian dissidents and is seeking to accelerate assistance in their effort to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to leave office.
On budget matters at home, Obama opened the door to compromise regarding the impending fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts.
The president said he was encouraged by recent comments from members of the Republican Party surrounding the need for more revenue from the wealthiest Americans as part of a plan to reduce the deficit.
"Both parties voted to set this deadline, and I believe both parties can make these decisions together ... in a balanced and responsible way," Obama said.
Obama stood by his previous statements about tax rates. He called on House Republicans to agree to Senate-passed proposals that would extend current tax rates for those making $250,000 a year while allowing rates to return to higher levels for those making over that amount and insisted he would not accept a lower tax rate for the wealthiest 2% of Americans.
His comments should not come as a surprise, he said, given his statements during the election.
"I've got one mandate to help middle class families and families working hard to get into the middle class," Obama said.
Letter to President Obama
Letter to President Obama
He specifically referenced a letter he received from a man in Tennessee who said he did not vote for Obama.
The voter said he was watching Obama's comments recently on CNN about the fiscal cliff and said his hope "is that we can make progress in light of personal and party principles, special interest groups, and years of business as usual. We've got to work together and put our differences aside."
After reading from the letter, Obama added: "I couldn't say it better myself. That's precisely what I intend to do."
The president is often criticized for not forging relationships with Congress, to the detriment of his agenda. On Wednesday he acknowledged that history and said he can "always do better."
His relationships haven't "always manifested itself in the kind of agreement I'd like to see between Democrats and Republicans," he said.
Obama is set meet with major CEOs following his news conference, some of whom flexed their political muscle to defeat Democrats in elections last week.
He is expected to find backing for some of the administration's positions ahead of negotiations with Congress on avoiding the fiscal cliff. Leaders of the largest companies have indicated they are holding back hiring and spending because they are worried about Washington gridlock over the fiscal cliff.
The president sat down Tuesday with labor leaders and the heads of six independent groups involved in organizing grassroots support for progressive causes and told them that he intended to allow the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans while preserving them for middle-income earners, according to several people at that meeting.
"The president was very strong on saying there's going to be an end to the Bush tax cuts one way or another," said one participant who requested anonymity to discuss the off-the-record meeting.
Obama is to meet with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at the White House on Friday.
The president took on two other issues that he has said he will address during his second term: immigration and climate change.
An increase in the Hispanic vote that helped him win battleground states, created an opening, Obama said, to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something he and members of Congress failed to pass during his first term.
He expects a bill to be introduced soon after his inauguration in January, adding an agreement should address border security and pathways to citizenship for thousands of illegal immigrants if they go to college or serve in the military.
Obama also reaffirmed his belief that "climate change is real" and is "impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions." He said it could be tackled if members of both political parties are prepared to make some "tough political" decisions.
The last time Obama held a full-blown news conference at the White House, his first campaign rally was two months away and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum looked to have the upper hand over Mitt Romney in the GOP presidential primaries.
To be sure, in some ways the political landscape has changed dramatically since Obama fielded questions from the White House press corps on March 6: He is now assured of four more years in the Oval Office and can claim fresh leverage in his dealings with Republicans over reaching a budget deal.
But in many ways, the political environment closely mirrors what it looked like eight months ago: Republicans remain in control of the House of Representatives, the GOP leadership maintains it is opposed to any measure that will raise tax rates on the nation's top earners and the president's approval rating remains stubbornly stuck around a less-than impressive 50%.
Moreover, with election-year politics having largely rendered Congress unproductive over the past year, many of the same issues remain at the forefront as they did the last time the president held a formal news conference -- namely the ballooning national debt, the tepid economic recovery, unrest in the Middle East and the specter of a nuclear Iran.
To be fair, Obama has taken the national media's questions in other forums since his March news conference, most recently in late August when he made an unannounced stop at the regular White House briefing in the midst of the heated campaign and a week before the start of the Republican National Convention.
But he only took four questions that day and the entire session lasted less than 30 minutes.
Moreover, the president ran for re-election while largely ignoring White House reporters in favor of local outlets and entertainment shows.
Pressed on why he wasn't taking more questions from national media outlets, Obama campaign aides said the president could reach more battleground voters via local news than through network television programs or national publications.
Fiscal cliff headache for middle class
Those interviews were largely filled with predictable softball questions, though it should be noted that one Colorado news anchor drew wide praise for aggressively questioning the president over conflicting White House accounts in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack.
The president also showed a preference for more light-hearted forms of media during the course of the campaign, granting interviews with comedians Jon Stewart and Jay Leno, daytime talk show "The View," and MTV's Sway Calloway.
Again, Obama aides stressed the president was likely to reach more undecided voters through these programs than traditional news shows. But critics, including some who are part of the very press corps Obama appeared to be ignoring, questioned whether the president was attempting to dodge more hard-edged questions.
Indeed, White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked last week if the president's more or less avoidance of the White House press corps over the last eight months showed a "certain amount of disdain" for them.
"Absolutely not," Carney replied. "Absolutely not. The president was out there campaigning for re-election and giving interviews daily to reporters ... from news organizations across the country, from regional newspapers and television stations, and answered a lot of tough questions."

'Oblivion' aims for the moon, falls short
By Tom Charity, Special to CNN
updated 8:51 AM EDT, Fri April 19, 2013
Tom Cruise stars as Jack Harper and Morgan Freeman stars as Malcolm Beech in "Oblivion."
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"Oblivion" is a Tom Cruise sci-fi film; he stars as the last guy on Earth
Critic Tom Charity says movie is shot beautifully but doesn't deliver
Director lacks the poetic imagination to animate this requiem, Charity says
Editor's note: This review may contain spoilers.
(CNN) -- Remember when the movies held the impending extinction of human life on the planet as a worst-case scenario -- something that could and would be heroically averted, if only at the last second? Nowadays, the end times are only the beginning: an apocalyptic backdrop is something we're going to be seeing a lot of this year, so we might as well get used to it.
In the glossy, derivative, ambitious and fatally underpowered "Oblivion," Tom Cruise is the last guy on Earth. He's Jack, a technician -- a mechanic, really -- whose job is to fix broken down drones (in a cute touch he sticks the first one back together with chewing gum). In other words, he's a bit like WALL-E, and Andrea Riseborough is his latter day Eve.
They live in a billion-dollar birdhouse perched up above the clouds, and in a quaintly chauvinist set up, he reconnoiters the skies in a flashy starfighter prototype, while she sits at an interstellar telephone exchange and relays the commands of mission controller Sally (an irritatingly twangy Melissa Leo) from on high.
See, the remainder of the human race has taken refuge on a giant spaceship (it looks like a floating audio speaker, something that wouldn't be out of place on the cover of an '80s progressive rock album). The plan is to scoot over to Saturn just as soon as they have sucked up enough hydropower from the Earth's oceans to fuel the journey.
Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman's bromance
Tom Cruise denies talking about divorce
But why? Well, because of the alien invaders who destroyed the moon and threw the biosphere out of whack, that's why. As Cruise mournfully intones in the movie's lugubrious prologue, we won the war, but lost the planet.
That's what the drones are for: to kill off the last remaining hostiles, or "scavs," who have taken refuge on the edge of the radioactive wastelands that cover most of the globe.
That's more than enough backstory, I know, but there's much more to come out, even as Jack goes about his daily routine, tracking down lost drones, revisiting ruined New York landmarks (the top of the Empire State Building now sits at ground level on a sea of dust), and occasionally going AWOL himself to grapple with fragmentary memories of a beautiful girl (Olga Kurylenko), and a lost world he has no right to remember.
The story is officially credited to an unpublished comic book by the film's director, Joseph Kosinski. But if you poured all the most memorable sci-fi films from the past half century into a blender, from "2001: A Space Odyssey" and the original "Planet of the Apes" all the way down to last year's "Prometheus," you would probably wind up with something very similar and equally synthetic -- though quite possibly more exciting.
While he immerses us in an often dazzling futurescape, for the most part Kosinski ("Tron: Legacy") lacks the poetic imagination to animate this requiem for a dying world -- comparisons with "WALL-E" are certainly not to this film's advantage -- and fails to convince us that he genuinely cares about the fate of his characters, let alone the planet. The movie's few action scenes are competent but unlikely to wow any battle-seasoned gamers out there.
Kosinski does produce one rabbit from his hat, a real surprise late in the game that sends the movie for a loop, but also undermines a good deal of the credibility he's worked hard to build up over the preceding hour and a half or so. Like "Prometheus," this is another of those earnest, overdetermined spiritual allegories that falls apart in the rear-view mirror.
It is certainly nice to look at though.
Director of photography Claudio Miranda was last seen picking up an Academy Award for his breathtaking work on "Life of Pi," and his images of an Earth turned to ash are almost as alluring. They're enough to lend the picture a sense of scope and even grandeur, but they can't paper over the cracks running right through its core.
"Oblivion" shoots for the moon and falls short.
