 Special Report
(CNN) -- All roads that lead to Baghdad are now controlled by coalition forces, CNN Correspondent Walter Rodgers was told by U.S. Army officials Sunday. He spoke with CNN anchor Bill Hemmer about recent developments.
RODGERS: Bill, good news for the United States and the coalition. Army sources have told CNN that the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, is completely encircled. U.S. forces, the Army and Marines, control all roads into and out of Baghdad. One senior officer told us if you want to stay alive, you better stay inside the city.
Baghdad is now completely encircled.
We do know that there was another army foray into the city throughout the hours a short while ago. Second Brigade, Third Infantry Division did a repeat tour pushing inside the city, flexing the U.S. Army's muscle -- very little action. She went into the city and came out again.
Seventh Cavalry, the unit with which I'm embedded just southwest of the city, has been under considerable fire throughout last evening and today. The Iraqis are firing antitank missiles at the U.S. Army vehicles. There have been no hits, but again, very serious fire against the 7th Cavalry. In point of fact, what we've been hearing is explosions intermittently throughout the day and heavy fighting again last night. Again, no 7th Cavalry casualties in all of this.
But what's been happening, and this is very interesting, is some of the Iraqi civilians are beginning to step forward and collaborate with the U.S. Army -- for example, the army interpreters and intelligence officers are talking with some of the Iraqi civilians in the roads along the way, and they are now telling the army where the Fedayeen -- that is, Saddam Hussein's most fanatic fighters -- are hiding.
What they're saying is the army has been told the Fedayeen hide in schools during the day and then come out and conduct guerrilla attacks, these hit-and-run attacks on the 7th Cavalry at night after dark. But again, the Fedayeen are, according to local Iraqi civilians, taking refuge in schools during the day and then coming out and trying to strike the 7th Cavalry.
HEMMER: Walt, you talk about surrounding and sealing off Baghdad. That has to be a huge task based on the sheer size of that city. Have they talked about how many entrances, how many roads, how many highways might be affected right now?
RODGERS: They have a list of the highways, they rattled off the names and numbers of each highway. But again, according to a high-ranking senior officer with the U.S. Army here, attached in this area, we were told that all roads into and out of Baghdad are now controlled by the U.S. Marines who have moved into positions, as well as the United States Army, of course, being the first here. All those roads in and out have been sealed. And as I say, one officer said if you want to stay alive, stay off those roads now.

'Healing process' begins at Discovery Channel By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Authorities find four other devices linked to Lee at a residenceDiscovery employees hold town hall and meet with crisis counselorsA police sniper shoots James Lee after Lee aims a gun at hostages, police sayAuthorities clear Discovery Channel headquarters (CNN) -- There were "a lot of hugs" and "a lot of tears" among employees at Discovery Channel headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, on Thursday -- one day after police shot and killed a man there who was holding three hostages. "The healing process" has begun, said David Leavy, a company spokesman. "Yesterday knocked us off the horse. But we're back in the saddle today." Leavy said the company's employees spent much of the day in a "town hall" with senior managers, and that over a dozen crisis counselors had been called in. Wednesday's hostage crisis "was a scary situation," he said. "I don't think anyone walked into the building today with the same bounce in their step." Leavy addressed reporters several hours after authorities gave an "all clear" after sweeping the Discovery building. The suspect killed by police was identified by Manger as James Lee. The hostages were unharmed. Police on Thursday said that Lee had two starter pistols that he used during the standoff, and not handguns as previously thought. Video: Gunman known for online rants

Montgomery County Fire Chief Richard Bowers said that authorities recovered four devices from the scene, and an additional four devices from a residence. He described the objects only as "devices," and said that they were rendered safe and detonated. Police Chief J. Thomas Manger said that if the devices Lee had strapped on exploded, they would have injured him and the hostages. He said police were investigating whether Lee acted alone. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and other elected officials praised the work of police and other authorities who responded on Wednesday. "They took a very bad and dangerous situation and they prevented it from becoming a lot worse," he said. "The actions they took prevented further loss of life." Manger said hostage negotiators negotiated for almost four hours by phone with Lee on Wednesday afternoon while police officers watched and listened to Lee on the building's surveillance system. "At times during the negotiations, he was calm, but I wouldn't call him lucid. The conversation was indicative to me he was dealing with some mental issues," he said. Manger said the three hostages were lying on the ground, but were not otherwise constrained. He said Lee mainly dealt with the hostage negotiators and did not communicate with the hostages. "He stayed on point with his issues with Discovery," Manger said. At one point, one of the hostages moved, drawing Lee's attention, Manger said. Lee pulled his gun and aimed it at the hostages, and it was at that point that a sniper inside the building took the shot that killed Lee, he said. Another police official, Capt. Paul Starks, said the decision to shoot the gunman was made after authorities heard a gunshot or explosion go off in the area. As the police moved in, the hostages were running out, he said. During the negotiations, Lee exhibited a "range of emotions," Manger said. At times he was agitated and at times he was calm, but he never strayed far from his grievance against Discovery, he said. According to a police spokesman, the suspect entered the building's main entrance "wearing what appeared to be metallic canister devices on his front and back. He also pulled a handgun out and was waving a handgun." According to Manger, Lee may have fired a shot when he entered the building. The three hostages held inside were a security guard and two other males, he said. Leavy said Wednesday that company officials were familiar with Lee, who had protested at the network in 2008, but the company "did not take his threats or demands seriously." During the standoff, fewer than 10 Discovery Channel employees remained in the building "for a while, to assist law enforcement on navigating the building and the infrastructure and then we were all evacuated about an hour, 90 minutes into it," Leavy said. Lee was linked to a manifesto that was posted on the internet, a source close to the investigation told CNN. The angry manifesto repeatedly refers to humans as "filth" and demands that the Discovery Channel "stop encouraging the birth of any more parasitic human infants." "Civilization must be exposed for the filth it is," the 1,149-word statement says. The online screed said in part, "Humans are the most destructive, filthy, pollutive creatures around and are wrecking what's left of the planet with their false morals and breeding culture." The writer blasted immigration, farming, weapons of mass destruction, automotive pollution, "and the whole blasted human economy." He demanded that the Discovery Channel broadcast daily prime-time shows devoted to "solutions to save the planet," perhaps in a game-show format, insisting, "Make it interesting so people watch and apply solutions!!!!" Many of the writer's comments were directed at "the media," saying, "You can reach enough people. It's your responsibility because you reach so many minds!!!" "The world needs TV shows that DEVELOP solutions to the problems that humans are causing, not stupify the people into destroying the world. Not encouraging them to breed more environmentally harmful humans," the manifesto says. "These are the demands and sayings of Lee," the manifesto concludes. Aaron Morrissey, the editor-in-chief of the web publication DCist, said he came across James Lee's anti-Discovery Channel manifesto in 2008, when Lee was planning to hold a protest against the channel. The 2008 protest, he said, "was not that well attended." A month or so later, Lee was arrested near the building on littering and disorderly conduct charges, Morrissey said. The littering charge stemmed from Lee's throwing money into the air, he said. According to court records, a man with the same name and age as Lee was found guilty in 2008 of disorderly conduct. James Lee was acquitted of littering in the same case, according to Montgomery County, Maryland, Circuit Court records, said Eric Nee, a senior assistant state's attorney. Lee's two-year supervised probation ended August 18, records show. Because of the 2008 incident, a judge had warned Lee that year not to come within 500 feet of Discovery Communications, according to Maryland's Gazette newspaper. Lee spent nearly two weeks in jail following his arrest and several days being evaluated by state psychiatrists, he said. ''I told them my idea of saving the planet," Lee was quoted in the Gazette. ''They couldn't find anything wrong with me." Lee said he began his crusade to save the planet after being laid off from his job in San Diego and reading ''Ishmael," a novel by Daniel Quinn about a gorilla that tells a man what it is like to live in captivity in a world where humans exploit natural resources. Lee said he then felt an ''awakening," watched former Vice President Al Gore's documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth," and decided he had been doing too little to protect the environment.CNN's Mike Ahlers, Charley Keyes, Carol Cratty, Brianna Keiler and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.

Obama: Republican criticism of Rice 'outrageous'
By Gregory Wallace, CNN
updated 2:42 PM EST, Thu November 15, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
President Obama in news conference defends U.N. ambassador against criticism over Libya attack
Obama tells Graham, McCain if they want to criticize someone, "they should go after me"
Graham, McCain respond to Obama by renewing calls for Watergate-style investigation
Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama called out Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain for their "outrageous" comments saying they would block U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice if she is nominated for secretary of state.
"If Senator McCain and Senator Graham and others want to go after someone they should go after me," Obama said at a White House news conference on Wednesday. "When they go after the U.N. ambassador apparently because they think she's an easy target, then they've got a problem with me."
Earlier Wednesday, Graham and McCain said they would use parliamentary means to hold up her nomination, should it be made, over her characterization of the deadly September attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya.
Rice was dispatched to several talk shows, where she said the incident involved a "spontaneous" demonstration. Senior administration officials later said Rice was speaking from talking points prepared for official use and the word "spontaneous" was a poor choice to describe what is now understood to have been a terrorist attack.
The assault killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans and was a flashpoint n the just completed presidential election campaign.
Transcript: Obama news conference
Rice is among the potential nominees to replace Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has said she does not wish to serve in Obama's second term but is willing to stay on until her replacement is confirmed by the Senate.
McCain to Obama: Not picking on anyone
McCain, Graham after Susan Rice on Libya
McCain took to the floor of the Senate about an hour after Obama's remarks and said that the president and other statements by officials on the attacks were "not true."
"The president of the United States did not tell the American people the truth about the attacks that took four brave Americans' lives that went on for eight, seven hours, for which we were totally unprepared. Mr. President, four brave Americans died. It has now been eight weeks. The American people have received nothing but contradictory statements from all levels of our government," he said, pounding his hand on the lectern.
Graham: I don't trust Susan Rice McCain charged that "this president and this administration has either been guilty of colossal incompetence or engaged in a cover up, neither of which are acceptable to the American people."
Graham responded to Obama with a sharp statement of his own: "Mr. President, don't think for one minute I don't hold you ultimately responsible for Benghazi. I think you failed as commander-in-chief before, during, and after the attack.
Live blog: President Obama's news conference
Asked off the Senate floor how personal the exchanges between the senators and Obama got, Graham said, "Well, you know, all I can say is I do hold him responsible. If he's worried about me not holding him responsible, he's wrong."
"I want to work with him on the fiscal cliff. I want to work with him on immigration. I'd like to work with him on other things that we need to do as a nation but I'm not gonna give him a pass here," Graham said.
Asked if he thought Rice should step down, Graham said, "I'm not asking her to step down. I'm just not going to promote anybody that I think is up to their eyeballs in the debacle."
Graham: I don't trust Susan Rice The scandal's impact on the military
In his remarks on Wednesday, Obama defended Rice's earlier televised comments, saying "she made an appearance at the request of the White House in which she gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her."
He said he is open to the appointment for Rice, although he said has not yet decided who he will advance when Clinton steps down. Speculation has also centered on U.S. Sen. John Kerry for secretary of state or defense.
Rice previously served as assistant secretary of state under former President Bill Clinton and was a foreign policy adviser to Obama's 2008 campaign.
Graham and other Republicans have not only questioned her statements, but also why the administration put her forward, rather than another top official who might have been more directly connected to the Libya situation.
"The reason I don't trust her is that I think she knew better, and if she didn't' know better, she shouldn't be the voice of America," Graham said.
Obama's opening bid on taxes
Both Graham and McCain have called for a select committee to investigate the Benghazi attacks, including the U.S. response and preparations, such as whether the consulate had adequate security.
"I just want to find out what happened in Benghazi in a coordinated fashion that the work product would be accepted by the American people," Graham said. "I've got some firm opinions. I think it was poorly handled. But we'll never know. I think it's a symptom of a greater problem."
He reiterated his call for one committee to investigate.
"Instead of going off in three different directions, where you don't coordinate your questions, and having people testify multiple times, let's put one committee together. Democrats will lead it. They should, they're in charge. And find out what happened.
"I'm dying to know -- Mr. President, I've got a simple question: Did you know the consulate was attacked in June? And if you do know it was attacked in June, why didn't you do something about protecting it?"
But Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who has joined forces with Graham and McCain in calling for a select committee investigation of Benghazi, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room" that she would put a hold on any Rice nomination until she answered questions.
"Then then I will reassess what her answers are on those questions," Ayotte said.
"I have serious concerns about where we are right now and trusting what she has to say, but I'm willing to listen to what she has to say," Ayotte added.
Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" that someone should lose their jobs over Benghazi but Rice should not be the issue. He said security questions are paramount.
"I think really the more important question isn't really about whether it was caused by terrorism or whether it was caused by a movie," he said. "Obviously it was terrorism, but I think the more important question is why were there no Marines guarding our ambassador. Who made the decision -- not an immediate... decision, but a month-long desk decision to send an ambassador into a war-torn country without any uniformed Marines."
Paul said he did not want to "pre-judge" any nomination for the secretary of state.

Snake on a plane forces emergency landing
By Jim Barnett, CNN updated 4:54 AM EST, Wed December 5, 2012
An Egyptian cobra like this one escaped from a carry-on bag on an Egypt Air flight from Cairo to Kuwait.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
A reptile shop owner smuggled an Egyptian cobra in his carry-on for an Egypt Air flight The snake's escape forced an emergency landing, where it was removed
The snake bit its owner, but the man refused medical attention, saying bite was superficial
(CNN) -- Ninety passengers aboard an Egypt Air flight from Cairo to Kuwait could have used actor Samuel L. Jackson this week after a snake reportedly bit a Jordanian man who smuggled the reptile onboard.
Jackson's character in the movie "Snakes on a Plane" tries to figure out how to save the aircraft after crates of hyped-up serpents started killing the cast.
There wasn't quite that kind of drama on Monday, but the incident forced the pilot to make an emergency landing in the Egyptian resort town of Al Ghardaqa on the Red Sea, according to The Jordan Times.

Staying safe around snakes
An Egypt Air official told the paper an investigation revealed that the 48-year-old passenger, who owns a reptile shop in Kuwait, had hidden the Egyptian cobra in a carry-on bag. The passenger was trying to control the snake after it bit his hand and started slithering under the seats.
The Egyptian daily al-Masry al-Youm reported that the man refused medical treatment, claiming his wound was only superficial. The plane resumed its flight to Kuwait after local authorities confiscated the snake.
Doctors told the passenger he should spend 24 hours in a hospital for observation, but the man refused, the Egyptian Air official said, according to The Jordan Times.
Egyptian cobras are commonly found across North Africa.
According to wildlife experts, the cobra's venom is so deadly it can kill a full-grown elephant in three hours or a person in about 15 minutes. The venom destroys nerve tissue and causes paralysis and death because of respiratory failure.
Legend has it that in ancient times, the Egyptian queen Cleopatra used an Egyptian cobra -- also known as an asp -- to commit suicide.

Meteor shows why it is crucial to keep an eye on the sky
By Colin Stuart, special for CNN
updated 10:12 AM EST, Fri February 15, 2013
A large chunk of a meteor that exploded over Russia is found in a lake on Friday, February 15.
A meteor streaks through the sky before exploding with a flash and boom that shattered glass in buildings and left hundreds of people hurt.
Workers repair a damaged power line near the wall of a local zinc plant. About 270 buildings were damaged -- mostly broken glass -- by shock waves caused by the blast, said Vladimir Stepanov of the National Center for Emergency Situations at the Russian Interior Ministry.
The meteor leaves a white streak through the sky. The national space agency, Roscosmos, said scientists believed one meteoroid had entered the atmosphere, where it burned and disintegrated into fragments, according to RIA Novosti.
The meteor's vapor trail passes over the city. A man removes shards of glass from the frame of a broken window. The meteor damaged windows at a sports hall.
By noon Russia time more than 725 people had sought medical help. HIDE CAPTION

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Meteor explosion above Russia left hundreds of people injured
Meteor came on day asteroid expected to pass 27,000 kilometers from Earth
Earth is sprinkled with around 170 craters also caused by debris falling from space
Stuart says unexpected meteor shows importance of monitoring space for potential threats
Editor's note: Colin Stuart is an astronomy and science writer, who also works as a Freelance Astronomer for the Royal Observatory Greenwich in London. His first book is due to be published by Carlton Books in September 2013. Follow @skyponderer on Twitter.
London (CNN) -- Reports coming from Russia suggest that hundreds of people have been injured by a meteor falling from space. The force of the fireball, which seems to have crashed into a lake near the town of Chebarkul in the Ural Mountains, roared through the sky early on Friday morning local time, blowing out windows and damaging buildings. This comes on the same day that astronomers and news reporters alike were turning their attention to a 40 meter asteroid -- known as 2012 DA14 -- which is due for a close approach with Earth on Friday evening. The asteroid will skirt around our planet, however, missing by some 27,000 kilometers (16,777 miles). Based on early reports, there is no reason to believe the two events are connected.

And yet it just goes to show how much space debris exists up there above our heads. It is easy to think of a serene solar system, with the eight planets quietly orbiting around the Sun and only a few moons for company. The reality is that we also share our cosmic neighborhood with millions of other, much smaller bodies: asteroids. Made of rock and metal, they range in size from a few meters across, up to the largest -- Ceres -- which is 1000 kilometers wide. They are left over rubble from the chaotic birth of our solar system around 5000 million years ago and, for the most part, are found in a "belt" between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. But some are known to move away from this region, either due to collisions with other asteroids or the gravitational pull of a planet. And that can bring them into close proximity to the Earth.

Meteor explosion caught on video
Once a piece of space-rock enters our atmosphere, it becomes known as a meteor. Traveling through the sky at a few kilometers per second, friction with the air can cause the meteor to break up into several pieces. Eyewitnesses have described seeing a burst of light and hearing loud, thunderous noises. This, too, is due to the object tearing through the gases above our heads. If any of the fragments make it to the ground, only then are they called meteorites.
Such events are rare, but not unprecedented. An object entered Earth's atmosphere in 1908 before breaking up over Siberia. The force of the explosion laid waste to a dense area of forest covering more than 2000 square kilometers. It is not hard to imagine the devastation of such an event over a more highly populated region. The Earth is sprinkled with around 170 craters also caused by debris falling from space. The largest is found near the town of Vredefort in South Africa. The impact of a much larger asteroid -- perhaps as big as 15 kilometers across -- is famously thought to have finished off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.
Opinion: Don't count 'doomsday asteroid' out yet
It is easy to see why, then, that astronomers are keen to discover the position and trajectory of as many asteroids as possible. That way they can work out where they are heading and when, if at all, they might pose a threat to us on Earth. It is precisely this sort of work that led to the discovery of asteroid 2012 DA14 last February by a team of Spanish astronomers. However, today's meteor strike shows that it is not currently possible to pick up everything.
A non-profit foundation, led by former NASA astronaut Ed Lu, wants to send a dedicated asteroid-hunting telescope into space that can scan the solar system for any potential threats. For now, astronomers will use Friday's fly-by to bounce radar beams off 2012 DA14's surface, hoping to learn more about its motion and structure. One day this information could be used to help move an asteroid out of an Earth-impacting orbit. This latest meteor over Russia just goes to show how important such work is and how crucial it is that we keep our eye on the sky.

Bassem Youssef: 'Sarcasm is a weapon'
By Ian Lee and Teo Kermeliotis, CNN
updated 7:08 AM EDT, Fri June 28, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Bassem Youssef is known as 'Egypt's Jon Stewart'
He is the host of a popular TV show poking fun at Egyptian news and politics
But his satire has often caused him trouble, and lawsuits have been filed against him
Youssef says comedy is key to rebuilding Egypt
African Voices is a weekly show that highlights Africa's most engaging personalities, exploring the lives and passions of people who rarely open themselves up to the camera. Follow the team on Twitter.
(CNN) -- There's a plaque affixed to the wall inside the lounge room of the downtown Cairo studio where Bassem Youssef films "Al Bernameg" ("The Program"), the Arab world's most watched TV show.
"Sarcasm," reads the top line in big capital letters. "Because beating the f*** out of people is illegal," it continues.
Reading the sign, Youssef's face instinctively turns into a familiar wide grin, similar to the one with which he greets the legions of viewers who tune in every week to watch him poking fun at news and politics.
But seconds later he shifts to a slightly more pensive stance. "Sometimes you are too emotional to do things that might be illegal, so you revert to sarcasm and comedy," says Youssef, who is frequently described as "Egypt's Jon Stewart."
Behind the scenes of 'Al Bernameg'
Bassem Youssef the politician?
"It's a huge weapon," he adds. "It's a very important weapon."
Egyptian movie star: 'Arabs are not terrorists' Armed with sharp-tongued humor, Youssef has become an icon for many in post-revolutionary Egypt. A trained heart surgeon, he started his satirical show from his flat amid the uprising, posting his work on YouTube. It got so popular that a major Egyptian channel picked it up. Since then, his satirical show has been drawing in tens of millions of viewers week in, week out, not just in Egypt but also across the Middle East and North Africa.
Yet not everyone is a fan.
Just a few months ago, Egypt's public prosecutor charged him with defaming President Mohamed Morsy, insulting Islam and spreading false news. Islamists have also filed a number of legal complaints on political or religious grounds, but activists say it's part of a campaign to silence the TV host.
Youssef says the reaction is rooted in Egypt's patriarchal society, a culture which, he says, does not tolerate criticism of those who are deemed more powerful: from elders to authorities.
"This is what has put us down as a community, as a population, for so long. We can't really talk back," says the 39-year-old.
I'm going to do this until the ceiling is broken or we are shut down.Bassem Youssef, Egyptian TV host
"It was fine when it was your parents but it's not fine when it's people with authority," he adds. "But we do that and we do it with humor and we do it with sarcasm. And people equate being laughed at as being ridiculed, (saying) 'I can't be ridiculed by this little dot dot dot brat' -- you can put whatever you want about me."

Last week Youssef welcomed to Al Bernameg Jon Stewart, the popular American comedian and host of the "Daily Show." For 20 minutes, the two satirists engaged in a wide-ranging conversation that veered from hilarious to serious to poignant, notwithstanding Stewart's support for his Egyptian counterpart.
"It doesn't get me into the kind of trouble that gets you into," Stewart told Youssef in response to a question about any backlash he's faced. "I get into trouble but nowhere near what happens to you," added Stewart, before continuing, "if your regime is not strong enough to handle a joke, then you don't have a regime."
While Youssef's comedy has brought him trouble on many occasions, the satirist says he's going to continue pushing the boundaries and battling for freedom of speech.

'Egypt's Jon Stewart' interrogated
"This is by far the most important issue that everybody should fight for," he says. "If you start to suppress people's freedom of speech under whatever excuse you want -- 'it's not good for the country, it's not good for the building of the country' -- so every time they say this, we raise the ceiling, we raise the roof, we push it further. And I'm going to do this until the ceiling is broken or we are shut down."
Shutting down is a real possibility, as lawsuits continue to be filed. But Youssef shrugs off the prospect with his usual humor. "I'm going to have a holiday if they stop me," he smirks. "Ah, I need a holiday."
He admits, however, that dealing with Egypt's day-to-day reality does have an effect on him.
"It brings me down all the time," says Youssef. "It's very difficult to write a show with all this happening; it becomes very depressing and it's overwhelming, it overshadows everything that you do."
Yet he remains adamant that comedy is key for Egypt to get through the current turmoil.
"Countries aren't built by boring people," he says. "As matter of fact, entertainment is a great industry so it helps to actually build the country.
"The thing is we aren't just being funny 'haha,' we are criticizing political situations. You can't just let it go. Other people can talk for hours about what's going on in the country. We take a couple of jokes and everyone talks about the problem.
"So, in a way, we are building the country."

Uncertainty after North Korea announces execution of leader's uncle
By Jethro Mullen and Tom Watkins, CNN
updated 10:58 AM EST, Fri December 13, 2013
In an image taken from footage shown by North Korea's KCTV and released by South Korea's Yonhap news agency on December 9, 2013, Jang Song-Thaek is reportedly being dragged away from his chair by two police officials during a meeting in Pyongyang. North Korea confirmed on December 9 that the powerful uncle of Kim Jong-Un, the nation's leader, had been removed. New reports from North Korea say that Jang has been executed. Japanese lawmaker Antonio Inoki, left, Jang Song Thaek and Kenshiro Matsunami, a former Japanese lawmaker, hold a meeting in Pyongyang, North Korea, on November 6. Jang Song Thaek was regarded as the second most powerful figure in North Korea.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
North Korea seems "not as stable as we thought," one analyst says
Some observers warn a provocative move like a missile or nuclear test could follow
Jang Song Thaek was married to Kim's aunt, was vice chairman of the top military body
North Korea state media say Jang was convicted and executed
(CNN) -- As the shock sinks in of North Korea's extraordinary announcement of the execution of leader Kim Jong Un's uncle and former protector, government officials and analysts are trying to decipher what the brutal move means.
The ruthless disposal of Jang Song Thaek -- Kim's uncle by marriage who had, until recently, been regarded as the second-most powerful figure in the secretive, nuclear-armed nation -- has serious implications for North Korea, its neighbors and the United States, observers said.
But exactly what is going on inside the notoriously opaque North Korea regime remains as murky as ever.
"We don't have a clear sense of this at all," said Victor Cha, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who represented the United States in nuclear talks with North Korea.
Some saw the execution, which North Korean state media reported early Friday, as a chilling demonstration of total control by Kim, the young leader who came to power two years ago.

"I think what he's telling people -- the United States, South Korea, China, others -- is that he is his own man, that you are going to have to deal with him," said Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshares Fund, a nuclear nonproliferation group.
Who is Jang?
Jang, who was married to Kim's aunt, was vice chairman of North Korea's top military body and had often been pictured beside the young leader, who is believed to be around 30. He was considered to be the regent who secured Kim's assumption of power after the 2011 death of his father, Kim Jong Il.
But in a lengthy article foaming with outraged rhetoric, North Korea's official news agency on Friday accused Jang of trying to overthrow the state, describing him as "despicable human scum."
One big question is whether Kim acted out of strength, consolidating the power he has amassed over the past two years, or out of fear his uncle was building a rival force inside the regime.
Kim already removed the country's top general last year, Cha noted. By taking down Jang, he's axed a powerful figure from the country's dominant Workers' Party.
"It makes you wonder: If he's consolidating his power, what is he building it around?" Cha said. "He's basically attacking the two most important institutions in North Korea, which is the party and the military."
A U.S. official said, "Executing someone with Jang's pedigree would be a dramatic statement that Kim Jong Un intends to be ruthless in consolidating his control.
"The public airing of the power play under way -- which is highly unusual -- is probably sending shockwaves through North Korea's leadership cadre."
Provocative moves
Few analysts interpreted the execution, which took place days after the North had said Jang had been dramatically removed from his government posts, as a healthy sign.
"If two weeks ago, we thought that North Korea was somewhat stable, I think today people feel that it's not as stable as we thought it was," said Cha, author of "The Impossible State: North Korea, Past and Future."
North Korean citizens bow before the portraits of the founding father Kim Il-Sung, left, and his son Kim Jong-Il, in Pyongyang, North Korea on Monday, April 9, 2012. April 15 marked the 100-year anniversary of the founder's birth and journalists were allowed inside the country.

Citizens dance on Monday during a rehearsal for the commemoration of Kim Il-Sung's 100th birthday anniversary. Japan, the United States and South Korea see the launch -- which would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions -- as a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. And a South Korean intelligence report says it's likely to precede a nuclear test, as it did in 2006 and 2009.

U.S. President Obama said the real consequence for North Korea, should it go through with the launch, is that the country's leaders will miss an opportunity. "I hope that at some point the North Koreans make the decision that it is in their interests to figure out how to feed their people and improve their economy rather than have big parades where they show off weapons," he said in March.

Photos: A glimpse inside North Korea

Writer Johan Nylander and his guide, Ko Chang Ho, watch as a North Korean guard deletes 90 photos deemed unacceptable. Nylander was able to recover the photos with the help of an IT specialist -- the images that follow are an edited selection.
This propaganda monument of "Dear Leader" Kim Jong-Il by a countryside road, not far from the border to China, was deleted by authorities. North Korea required images of leaders be full body shots. People standing by the train track, while a guard is monitoring the bike race. In the city of Rason, people are leaning out of windows to get a glimpse of the Western cyclists.

Photos: Kim Jong Un's military
Suh Sang-ki, a lawmaker in South Korea's governing Saenuri Party who sits on a parliamentary intelligence committee, said the decision to kill Jang suggests Kim's power is weaker than that of his father.
In a statement issued after a phone briefing from South Korea's National Intelligence Service, Suh said the execution appeared to be a pre-emptive effort to prevent any internal unrest over Jang's ouster.
Analysts said North Korea was likely to continue with the provocative moves under Kim that have strained its relations with South Korea, the United States and others.
"I think there's going to be a clear amount of brinksmanship," said Yun of the Ploughshares Fund. "I think if we continue to wait for him to do things, he's going to continue to shoot missiles, and he'll probably at some point decide to test a nuclear weapon."
Missile and nukes
North Korea carried out a long-range rocket launch a year ago and an underground nuclear test, its third so far, in February. The U.N. sanctions that followed were met by a barrage of threatening rhetoric from Pyongyang, directed at South Korea and the United States, which ratcheted up tensions in the region.
The situation has calmed since, and the North and South have resumed dialogue. The two sides have agreed to meet next week in their joint industrial zone on the North's side of the border.
But with the anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death, last year's rocket launch and now Jang's execution, Seoul is keeping a close eye on Pyongyang's actions, officials said.
The South Korean defense ministry said Friday that no unusual activities by the North Korean military had been detected.
"December has always been a month in which something happens with North Korea," Cha said. "And we're only halfway through it."
In Washington, a State Department official acknowledged having seen the report of Jang's execution. "While we cannot independently verify this development, we have no reason to doubt the official KCNA report," deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement, referring to North Korea's state news agency.
"If confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime. We are following developments in North Korea closely and consulting with our allies and partners in the region," Harf added.
China, whose senior officials were considered to have close ties to Jang, described the recent developments as North Korea's "internal affairs."
Beijing hopes and believes that relations between the two countries "will continue (to) advance healthily and steadily," Hong Lei, a foreign ministry spokesman, said at a regular briefing Friday.

'Worse than a dog'
The official North Korean report on the execution said a special military tribunal had been held Thursday against Jang, who was accused of trying to overthrow the state "by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods."
It added, "All the crimes committed by the accused were proved in the course of hearing and were admitted by him."
Once his guilt was established, Jang was immediately executed, it said.
The KCNA report described Jang as a "traitor for all ages" and "worse than a dog," saying he had betrayed his party and leader.
Jang and his allies were accused of double-dealing behind the scenes, "dreaming different dreams" and selling the country's resources at cheap prices, thereby threatening North Korea's economic development, according to a KCNA statement this week.
"Jang desperately worked to form a faction within the party by creating illusion about him and winning those weak in faith and flatterers to his side," the statement said.
It also accused Jang of womanizing, drug use, gambling, eating at expensive restaurants and undergoing medical treatment in a foreign country.
Friday's KCNA report said Jang distributed pornographic pictures among his confidants and took at least 4.6 million euros ($6.3 million) "from his secret coffers and squandered it in 2009 alone."
Analysis: North Korean execution raises more questions than answers

China's next leaders: Who's who
China's ruling elite meet at the 18th Communist Party National Congress this year to reveal new members of the Politburo Standing Committee. At least five places are up for grabs on the team to lead China for the next 10 years. With leading analyst Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution, CNN profiles the top contenders.
Xi Jinping
Li Keqiang
Zhang Dejiang
Li Yuanchao
Wang Qishan
Yu Zhengsheng
Wang Yang
Liu Yandong
Hu Chunhua
Liu Yunshan
Zhang Gaoli
Xi Jinping
The 59-year-old presumptive next leader of China is a so-called "princeling," the son or daughter of a revolutionary veteran. Born in Fuping County, Shaanxi Province, Xi was sent to work on an agricultural commune before being accepted into the prestigious Tsinghua University in 1975.
Xi studied chemical engineering and went on to serve as a personal secretary to the then minister of defense Geng Biao. His early political career took him from his native province to Hebei and later Fujian, where he served as vice governor in 1999, before being promoted to governor a year later.
In 2002, Xi took up senior government and Party positions in Zhejiang, a province on the country's southeast coast. He entered the Standing Committee of the Politburo in 2007 and in 2008 became the country's vice president. In 2010 he was also promoted to vice chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission and China's Central Military Commission. He's also president of the Central Party School.
Personal life
Xi's father, Xi Zhongxun, was a top Communist who was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution. After his release, Xi senior was elected to the Politburo and served as vice premier. During his time in power, he supported economic liberalization and was instrumental in creating China's Special Economic Zones. Xi is married to Peng Liyuan, a famous Chinese folk singer and his second wife. They have one daughter, Xi Mingze, who is reported to be studying at Harvard University.
Inside track
Xi is considered to be a protégé of former Chinese leaders President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Zeng Qinghong. Xi has long been known for his market-friendly approach to economic development," said Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution in a report on China's Top Future Leaders to Watch. "Yet he has also displayed strong support for 'big companies,' especially China's flagship state-owned enterprises," Li added.
"Xi's experience in the military -- serving as a personal assistant to the minister of defense early in his career -- also makes him stand out among his peers."
Li Keqiang
Unless there's a major upset, China's 57-year-old Vice Premier Li Keqiang looks set to replace Premier Wen Jiabao in March 2013, when the reshuffle of government posts is formalized. Li is already the seventh-ranked member of the Politburo Standing Committee after rising through the Communist Youth League, a training ground for party leaders. Born in Dingyuan County, Li was in his late teens when he spent four years doing manual labor with the Dongling Production Brigade in his native Anhui Province. In 1978, he went to Peking University, where he graduated with degrees in law and economics.
In the 1980s and '90s, Li served as secretary-general of the All-China Students Federation, then held party positions in the Communist Youth League Central Committee. In 1999, he was promoted to governor of Henan Province and later became chairman of the Standing Committee of the Henan's Provincial People's Congress.
From there, he moved to Liaoning before being made a member of the Politburo Standing Committee in 2007. Li is considered a core member of President Hu Jintao's "Tuanpai faction," whose ties originate with the Communist Youth League.
Personal life
Li is one of the non-princelings vying for a place at the top of China's political hierarchy. According to Brookings, he comes from a midlevel official family; his father was a county-level cadre. Li's wife, Cheng Hong, is a professor of English language and literature at Capital University of Economics and Business in Beijing, according to reports, which also suggest they have one daughter who is studying in the United States.
Inside track
"Based on his previous work and the populist policy agenda he shares with his mentor Hu Jintao, Li's hot-button policy issues will include increasing employment, offering more affordable housing, providing basic health care, balancing regional development and promoting innovation in clean energy technology," according to Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution.
Zhang Dejiang
Zhang Dejiang was vice premier of China's State Council until he was suddenly diverted to replace disgraced party chief Bo Xilai as leader of Chongqing in March 2012.
Born in Tai'an, Liaoning province, 65-year-old Zhang was in his early 20s when he was sent to the countryside to work at the Luozigou Commune in Wangqing County, Jilin Province.
In the early 1970s, Zhang worked in the county propaganda department before studying Korean at Yanbian University. He served as secretary of the local Communist Youth League branch in Liaoning before crossing the border to North Korea to study economics at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang.
In the '80s, Zhang returned to Yanbian, where he held senior positions in the Communist Party before taking a role as the vice minister of civil affairs. Senior party positions followed in Jilin until Zhang moved south to Zhejiang to become secretary of the CPC's Provincial Committee.
In 2002, he entered the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee and become secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee. Zhang's political record is alleged to have been blemished by incidents while in Guangdong, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which claimed he was implicated in efforts to conceal the SARS epidemic. Railways were also under his portfolio during the public outrage that followed the collision of two high-speed trains in July 2011.
Personal life
Zhang is a princeling, the son of Zhang Zhiyi, a former PLA major general who is reported to have served as deputy commander of the Artillery Force in the Guangzhou Military Region. Zhang's wife, Xin Shusen, has a long history of holding senior positions at the China Construction Bank and is also said to be a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, according to the Brookings Institution. Zhang is considered a protégé of former leader Jiang Zemin.
Inside track
The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said Zhang's sudden appointment to Chongqing may indicate that he won't be on the short list for the Politburo Standing Committee. If he is, Brookings expert Cheng Li said he may "continue to promote policies in favor of the development of state-owned enterprises, state monopoly and so-called indigenous innovation (economic protectionism)."
Li Yuanchao
The current head of the Organization Department of the Communist Party, Li Yuanchao is considered a strong contender for entry into the Politburo Standing Committee, the small team of men steering China's future policy.
Another princeling, 62-year-old Li is the son of Li Gancheng, a former vice mayor of Shanghai. Born in 1950 in Lianshui, Jiangsu province, Li was sent to work on a farm in Dafeng County for four years before studying mathematics at Shanghai Normal University and becoming a middle school teacher.
Li taught at two schools in Shanghai -- Nanchang Middle School and Luwan District Sparetime Vocational School -- before returning to study at Fudan University, where he majored in mathematics. He also holds a doctoral degree in law from the Central Party School and spent time studying public administration at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
Li's political career took off with senior positions in the Chinese Communist Youth League in Shanghai. He later worked at the Information of the State Council and General Office of Foreign Publicity of the CCP Central Committee, before taking the role of vice minister of the Ministry of Culture. Li also occupied top party positions in Jiangsu Province.
As the current head of the Organization Department, Li wields a lot of power and influence in the promotion and demotion of party and government officials nationwide. He, too, is considered a member of Hu's "Tuanpai faction."
Personal life
Li is married to Gao Jianjin, a professor of music at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing, according to the Brookings Institution. They have one son, Li Haijin, who is said to have worked as sales person in drug companies in the United States and in Switzerland. He is now studying at Yale University.
Inside track
"His unusual combination of identities -- a Shanghai-originated leader who has not been associated with the so-called Shanghai Gang, a princeling who advanced his career primarily from the CCYL, and an enthusiastic supporter of Hu-Wen's macroeconomic control policy who recently ran a fast-growing coastal province -- may help him gain broader support in the leadership," said Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution. "Li is one of the few fifth-generation leaders who have called for serious political reforms, inner-party democracy, and tougher measures to deal with official corruption."
Wang Qishan
Described by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as "decisive and inquisitive" and possessing a "wicked sense of humor," Wang Qishan currently serves as the vice premier in charge of economic, energy and financial affairs under Premier Wen Jiabao. Born in 1948 in Tianjin, Wang was sent to work at the Fengzhuang People's Commune in Yan'an County, Shaanxi Province, before taking a job at the Shaanxi Provincial Museum.
After graduating from Northwest University with a degree in history, Wang returned to the museum before embarking on his ascent of China's political ladder. He held top positions at the Rural Development Research Center under the State Council in the '80s before joining the China Rural Trust and Investment Corporation. Wang later joined the People's Bank of China and China Construction Bank before filling senior party roles in Guangdong and then Hainan. In 2004, he became mayor of Beijing, and as executive chairman for the Beijing Organizing Committee, played a key role in pulling together the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Personal life
Wang is married to Yao Mingshan, whom he met in Yan'an in 1969 when both were sent to work in the countryside, according to the Brookings Institution. Yao's father is Yao Yilin, a former Politburo Standing Committee member and vice premier. Wang is thought to have strong ties to former President Jiang Zemin who counted Yao Yilin among his supporters in the Politburo Standing Committee.
Inside track
"His widely known nickname in China is 'the chief of the fire brigade.' The Chinese public regard Wang as a leader who is capable and trustworthy during times of emergency or crisis," said Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution.
"Based on his previous leadership experiences and policy initiatives, Wang will most likely promote the development of foreign investment and trade, the liberalization of China's financial system, and tax-revenue reforms, which are crucial for central-local economic relations."
Yu Zhengsheng
Yu Zhengsheng has a remarkable family background that includes a connection to the former wife of Mao Zedong and a brother who dramatically defected to the United States in the mid-'80s. He also occupies one of the top jobs in Chinese politics and is considered a strong contender for the Politburo Standing Committee, although analysts say his age may work against him.
Born in 1945, Yu majored in ballistic missile automatic control at the Harbin Military Engineering Institute before working as technician in radio factories in Hebei Province. In the late 1970s, Yu started working his way up the promotion scale in the Fourth Ministry of Machine-Building Industry and later joined the Ministry of Electronics Industry.
He spent some time working as the president, vice chairman and member of the Leading Party Members' Group of the China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped before taking a political position in Shandong Province.
Yu rose to become mayor of Qingdao, a major city in eastern Shandong, before being appointed minister of construction in 1997. As the current CPC party chief in Shanghai, a position he took in 2007, Yu presides over China's largest city for finance and business.
Personal life
Yu is also a princeling whose father, Huang Jing (Yu Qiwei), a former mayor of Tianjin, was the first husband of Jiang Qing, a famous actress who later married Mao Zedong and was vilified for her role in the Cultural Revolution. Sensationally, Yu's brother -- Yu Qiangsheng -- was a top Chinese intelligence officer who caused a diplomatic storm when he defected to the United States in 1985.
Yu is considered a protégé of former leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin. Deng's son, Deng Pufang, ran the China Welfare Fund for the handicapped where Yu worked in the '80s. Yu also worked under Jiang, who was once head of the Ministry of Electronics Industry. Yu is married to Zhang Zhikai, the daughter of Zhang Zhenhuan, a former major general with the PLA.
Inside track
"Based on his previous leadership experiences and recent public speeches, Yu's hot-button policy issues may include the promotion of the private sector, urban development, legal development and social reform to promote confidence-building and mutual trust in society," said Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution.
Wang Yang
A one-time factory hand at a food processing plant in Anhui Province, Wang Yang is a non-princeling contender for the Politburo's Standing Committee.
As party chief of Guangdong province, Wang presides over a population of 100 million, including millions who have moved to the region to share in its recent economic growth. The 57-year-old is seen as open-minded and unorthodox, especially after negotiating a peaceful resolution to unrest in the fishing village of Wukan in 2011. Wang bowed to villagers' demands, returned some contested land and allowed local democratic elections to be held for the first time in China. The unusual move earned Wang a place on TIME's 2012 list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World. Born in 1955, Wang graduated from the University of Science and Technology with a master's degree in engineering. He started his career in Anhui Province, where he later served as mayor of Tongling City from 1988. In the 1990s, Wang served as executive vice governor of the province before he joined the central government, where he became vice minister of the National Development and Reform Commission and then deputy secretary-general of the State Council. Between 2005 and 2007, Wang served as party chief in Chongqing, a role he passed to the now disgraced politician Bo Xilai.
Personal life
According to the Brookings Institution, Wang was born into a humble family. As the eldest child, Wang is said to have started work at age 17 to help support the family after his father's death. His political talent was spotted early when he became mayor of Tongling while in his early thirties.
Inside track
Wang is said to have developed "a very unusual" rivalry with disgraced politician Bo, centered on their models of provincial reform, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.
However, Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution said Bo's removal does not necessarily give Wang a clear shot at the leadership. "Bo's downfall does not necessarily mean an absolute victory for Wang. Other princelings now believe Wang's power and influence will expand very quickly, and thus they may create barriers to his quick advancement to the PSC, the pinnacle of power," he said.
Liu Yandong
The only female member of the Politburo, Liu Yandong is considered a possible contender for entry to the Standing Committee. If she succeeds, she'll be in the first woman to hold a top position in the Chinese leadership.
Born in 1945 in Jiangsu Province, Liu graduated from Tsinghua University in the late 1960s with a degree in chemical engineering. She also holds a master's degree in sociology and a doctoral degree in law from two other universities.
After working at a chemical plant in Hebei Province, Liu spent most of the 1970s working at the Beijing Chemical Experiment Plant, where she filled senior party roles. In the early '80s, Liu became a cadre in the Organization Department of the CCP Committee before joining the All-China Youth Foundation, which she chaired.
Liu joined the United Front Work Department in the early '90s and it wasn't long before she took the top position, where she remains.
Personal life
A princeling, Liu is the daughter of Liu Ruilong, the former vice minister of agriculture. She is also said to have strong family ties with former Chinese President Jiang Zemin. According to the Brookings Institution, Liu's father introduced Jiang's adoptive father to the Communist movement in 1928. Liu is said to be a close supporter of President Hu Jintao, who she met four decades ago while a political councilor at Tsinghua University, according to the U.S. think tank.
Inside track
"(Liu) is often seen as liberal minded, and may call for the greater political participation of other parties, interest groups, and NGOs in China's political process," said Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution. "In recent years, Liu has advocated for the promotion of China's cultural exchanges overseas."
Hu Chunhua
One of seven siblings born to a poor farming family in 1963, Hu Chunhua is considered an outside chance for entry to the Politburo Standing Committee because of his strong ties to his mentor, President Hu Jintao. The two were said to have met in Tibet, where the younger Hu worked as a clerk at the Organization Department in the CCP Committee of Tibet after graduating from Peking University with a degree in Chinese literature. Hu worked his way up the political hierarchy as a member of the Chinese Communist Youth League in Tibet. He then served at the CCYL National Committee and China's Youth Federation in Beijing, before returning to Tibet, where he filled the role of deputy party secretary and executive vice governor. In 2009, Hu was promoted to governor of Hebei Province and is currently the Communist Party Secretary for Inner Mongolia.
Personal life
According to the Brookings Institution, Hu is considered a "carbon copy of Hu Jintao." "Both come from humble family backgrounds, both were student leaders in their college years, both advanced their political careers primarily through the CCYL, both worked in arduous work environments such as Tibet, both served as provincial party secretaries at a relatively young age and both have low-profile personalities," the think tank said. Hu was married in Tibet and has one daughter.
Inside track
According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Hu is considered by many to be a front-runner to succeed Xi Jinping as the party leader and president in 2022. However, it said competition from more senior party members and factional pressure may put him in line for a "less dramatic" promotion to the full Politburo.
Liu Yunshan
The head of China's Propaganda Department is considered one to watch as the country identifies its future leaders.
Born in 1947 in Xinzhou, Shanxi Province, Liu Yunshan worked as a teacher in Inner Mongolia, before being sent to do manual labor in a rural commune in Sobugai People's Commune during the Cultural Revolution. After leaving the commune, Liu spent a number of years in Inner Mongolia, working as a journalist and in public relations before taking a party position with the Communist Youth League Committee in the autonomous region.
In the early '90s, Liu moved to Beijing to become deputy director of the CCP Propaganda Department, where he was later promoted to director. Personal life
Liu has close ties with Hu Jintao, formed when both of them worked at the CYL, according to research by the Brookings Institution. Liu's son, Liu Lefei, heads CITIC Private Equity Funds Management and was last year named by Fortune Magazine as one of the 25 most powerful business people in Asia. The young Liu is married to Jia Liqing, the daughter of Jia Chunwang, the former chief of state security, according to research from the Brookings Institution.
Inside track
"The possible reduction of the number of PSC seats from nine to seven may undermine Liu's chance for promotion," said Brookings' China expert Cheng Li. However, a report form the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said his prior experience makes him a "natural candidate" to succeed Li Changchun as head of the "Propaganda and Ideology" policy portfolio.
Zhang Gaoli
Born in 1946, in Jinjiang City, Fujian province, Zhang Gaoli is currently party secretary of Tianjin, a bustling city of around 13 million people and one of China's four municipalities.
Zhang started his career in the oil industry, at the Guangdong Maoming Petroleum Company, after studying planning and statistics at Xiamen University. He spent around 12 years working his way up the political ladder in Guangdong Province, including a stint as party secretary in the special economic zone of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong.
In 2001, Zhang became governor and later party secretary of Shandong Province before moving to Tianjin in 2007.
Personal life
Believed to be a protégé of former President Jiang Zemin, Zhang is also thought to have received support in his latter career from former Vice President Zeng Qinghong. According to the Brookings Institution, Zhang married a former university classmate with whom he has one daughter who is married to a wealthy Hong Kong businessman.
Inside track
Zhang's "hot-button" issues remain unknown due to his "low-profile" approach to career advancement, according to Brookings' expert Cheng Li. However, "in general, Zhang has been known for his pro-market economic policy orientation, especially evident in his leadership tenure in Shenzhen," he said.
