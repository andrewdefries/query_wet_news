Pregnant Marine missing from North Carolina baseStory Highlights Lance corporal due to give birth at any time, sheriff says Marine's car found Monday at bus station Mother reported Marine missing on December 19 Sheriff: Marine was to testify about incident at base, according to mother Next Article in U.S. » Read VIDEO (CNN) -- A search is under way for a pregnant 20-year-old Marine who has been missing from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, since December 14. Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach was eight months pregnant when she went missing on December 14. Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach could give birth at any time, Onslow County Sheriff Ed Brown told the Jacksonville, North Carolina, Daily News on Monday. The sheriff's department said Lauterbach's mother said that her daughter, of Montgomery, Ohio, had witnessed an incident at Camp Lejeune and was to testify about it. Sheriff's department officials said evidence causes them to be concerned about Lauterbach's disappearance, WITN reported. The Marine's car was found Monday at Jacksonville's bus station, Brown told the Daily News, and her cell phone had been found at Camp Lejeune's front gate on December 20. Her mother reported her missing on December 19, and told the sheriff's department "that she was very suspicious that something bad may have happened to her daughter," the department said in a news release. Watch Lauterbach's mom say what raised her concerns » Investigators told the Marine Corps Times that a withdrawal from Lauterbach's bank account was made on December 14 and said there was "suspicious activity" on the account 10 days later. December 14 was also the last time Lauterbach's cell phone was used, authorities told the Marine Corps Times. The Raleigh News and Observer, citing Brown, reported that the woman's mother said her daughter phoned home or her relatives up to 12 times a week and the mother became concerned when she did not hear from her daughter for five days.

WDTN: Marine talked to mom before disappearance
A Facebook page established to help find Lauterbach says she was last seen December 14 in Jacksonville. "Call mom!!! You know the number," the page says. "All of us love you and we miss you. Please come home!" The page contains pleas for contacts from fellow Marines and friends of Lauterbach in Ohio. Lauterbach is a personnel clerk assigned to Combat Logistics Regiment 27, 2nd Marine Logistics Group, II Marine Expeditionary Force, the Marine Corps said. She joined the service on June 6, 2006.

Date for Tibetan 'Serfs Emancipation Day' set Story Highlights Day to mark when China says one million people freed from serfdom 50 years ago Dalai Lama spokesman says China needs to deal with the problem in Tibet Tibet is technically autonomous from the central Chinese government But its current government is directed from Beijing Next Article in World » Read VIDEO By Miranda Leitsinger CNN	(CNN) -- Lawmakers in Tibet have approved March 28 as a day to mark the freeing of serfs in the troubled region, a move that a Dalai Lama representative said Tuesday did not address problems facing the area "realistically and seriously." Tibetan monks in exile pray at a temple in Dharamsala, India, in November. The bill approved by legislators on Monday will mark the date that China says about one million people were freed from serfdom 50 years ago in the Himalayan region, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The legislation was aimed at "reminding all the Chinese people, including Tibetans, of the landmark democratic reform initiated 50 years ago," said Pang Boyong, deputy secretary general of Tibet's regional parliament, Xinhua reported. While Tibet is technically autonomous from the central Chinese government, its current government is directed from Beijing. The Dalai Lama, traditionally the spiritual and political leader of the Tibetan Buddhists, lives in exile in India. The "Serfs Emancipation Day" falls near the 50th anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against Beijing's rule that sent the Dalai Lama into exile. "March 10th will be the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan national uprising and actually we would consider this an opportunity now for the Chinese to show to the world what a great upcoming power they are in being able to come to terms with accepting that there is a problem inside Tibet and with committing themselves to finding a realistic solution that would bring about stability and unity, and which would be mutually beneficial to both parties where Tibet would also remain with the People's Republic of China," Tenzin Taklha, joint secretary of the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, said. "It's best not to avoid the situation, that we accept the reality that there is a problem inside Tibet and that was clearly demonstrated by the demonstrations we saw that took place in March of last year. So I think the Chinese, instead of trying to hide this fact by declaring these new holidays, they should address the issue realistically and seriously," he added. Tibetan Buddhists say they resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in China. Resentment against the Chinese in Tibet spilled over last March, when Buddhist monks initiated peaceful anti-Chinese protests -- on the anniversary of the failed 1959 uprising -- in the regional capital of Lhasa. The protests soon turned violent, with demonstrators burning vehicles and shops. Some protesters advocated independence from China, while others demonstrated against the growing influence of the Han Chinese in the area and other regions of China with ethnic Tibetan populations. The subsequent crackdown left 18 civilians and one police officer dead, according to the Chinese government. Tibet's self-proclaimed government-in-exile put the death toll from the protests at 140. China accuses the Dalai Lama of fomenting the discord in his homeland -- a charge he denies. The Dalai Lama has said he does not advocate violence or a separate and independent Tibet. He has said he wants a genuine autonomy that preserves the cultural heritage of the region.

Opinion: Tibetans reject Chinese rule with one voice
By Stephanie Brigden, Special to CNN
updated 9:22 AM EST, Tue December 11, 2012
Protesters carrying posters of Tibetans who have self-immolated walk to the United Nations in New York on December 10, 2012.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Free Tibet: We have seen protesters die from their injuries, survivors disappear by authorities
As many as 29 Tibetans have self-immolated in protest against Chinese rule, group says
Without legal or political recourse to address their grievances, they risk their lives, says Brigden
Brigden: World remains largely unaware of the situation as the region is effectively cut off
Editor's note: Stephanie Brigden is Director of Free Tibet, a London-based organization that campaigns for self-determination for Tibetans and human rights in Tibet. Please note the opinions expressed are those of Brigden and Free Tibet. Her claims cannot be verified by CNN.
London (CNN) -- As I write, we have just received news of what we believe to be the 29th Tibetan in the past month to set fire to themselves in protest at Chinese rule in Tibet. By the time you read this, it is likely that more have made this extraordinary choice.
At Free Tibet we have seen protesters die from their injuries and survivors disappear by Chinese state authorities. It's hard to imagine how bad the circumstances must be for a person to decide that the most effective way they can make their views known is to wrap barbed wire around their body -- so that burning clothes cannot be pulled off them -- drink gasoline, pour it over themselves, light the fuel and be consumed by fire.
Tibetans can't vote, their petitions to government are ignored, protest of any kind is criminalized and, once imprisoned, most Tibetans are denied a lawyer.
Read: How many more Tibetans will sacrifice themselves?
Without legal or political recourse to address their grievances, they risk their lives, their liberty and the safety of their families to protest China's occupation of Tibet. This goes some way to explain why more than 90 Tibetans from all walks of life have called for freedom by setting themselves on fire -- all other avenues have proved futile. There are thousands more who have protested in other ways.
China has responded not by negotiating, but by perpetrating further violations of Tibetans' human rights in efforts to stamp out dissent, which is deemed a threat to "One China."

New realities for Tibetans in China
Read: Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture explains position on self-immolations
We have seen military and security forces descend in large numbers on places where self-immolations have taken place. Over much of the last year and a half, since a young monk called Phuntsog set fire to himself there, the Chinese military have lined the streets of the town of Ngaba; road blocks restricting people's movements. Free Tibet has received reports of security forces ransacking homes, beating people in their houses and in public in a show of force and intimidation of the community.

People suspected of being involved with those who have set fire to themselves are criminalized. Rewards -- the equivalent of a generous annual salary -- are on offer for information about collaborators, and anyone suspected of collaboration can expect to receive a prison sentence of up to 13 years.
Free Tibet has documented a number of incidents of collective punishment of communities where protests have taken place. Last month, a public information broadcast on Tibetan television outlined, in great detail, collective punishment measures for communities where self-immolations take place: the families of those who set fire to themselves will have any state benefits removed, communities where protests take place will not receive investment for local projects for three years; government officials will be "removed."
Read: Act of faith, desperation or protest: Self-immolations through time
Although protests by fire have captured the attention of the international media, there are other protests across Tibet that have not gained such coverage.
Thousands, from school children to the elderly, are engaging in peaceful protests. They have been shot at -- some killed, many more wounded -- by Chinese security forces. Over five days in January, in three separate incidents, Free Tibet received reports that five Tibetans were shot dead, many more wounded, when security forces opened fire on peaceful protesters. We believe those suspected of involvement in the protests have been rounded up and detained in their hundreds; scores have been disappeared; many have been tortured and some have died while in detention, most likely from the wounds they sustained during torture.
Others have acted alone. Jigme Dolma, a 17-year-old girl, was beaten and detained by security forces for throwing Buddhist writings in the air and calling for the release of political prisoners. Her protest lasted five minutes; her sentence, after having been disappeared for several months, is three years in prison.
The rest of the world knows very little about the situation in Tibet because few places today, except perhaps North Korea, are so effectively cut off from the rest of the world.
Internet and mobile phone signals are routinely blocked, particularly in areas where protests take place. When they aren't blocked they are tightly monitored and Tibetans suspected of "sharing information" are regularly disappeared or detained and receive up to life imprisonment just for sending an e-mail. One Tibetan, who declined to be identified, recently told us: "I really don't have the courage to sacrifice my life with immolation but I can spend time in Chinese jail for passing on the truth."
Human rights monitors and international diplomats are refused entry to Tibet and the international media are banned. The only journalists who have reported from Tibet over the last two years have done so by entering the country undercover, hidden on the back seats of cars. Even then, most only manage to film through a car window.
All these impediments make securing and verifying information an extremely dangerous job for anyone inside the country, and a constant challenge for organizations like Free Tibet.
Free Tibet ensures that governments do know what is happening in Tibet, despite China's best efforts to gloss over and conceal the truth. Sadly, many countries choose to turn a blind eye.
We welcome steps taken by the U.S. -- for instance Ambassador to China Gary Locke's public statement urging Beijing to negotiate with the Tibetan people to address policy failures in Tibet -- but there is so much more that the international community must do if Tibetans are to enjoy the freedoms so many of us take for granted.
*Please note CNN has offered the Chinese government a chance to comment but we have not yet received a response.

Protests erupt in Bangladesh after war-crimes verdict

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The demonstrations began Tuesday, when Abdul Quader Mollah was sentenced to life
He was found guilty of 5 of 6 charges, including crimes against humanity
He declared he is innocent and cursed the judges in court
Four people have died in related violence in the port city of Chittagong
Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Outraged by a court verdict they considered too lenient, thousands of people took to the streets across Bangladesh on Wednesday demanding the death penalty for an Islamic party leader convicted of war crimes carried out more than four decades ago.
"We've taken additional measures across the country to heighten security," State Minister for Home Affairs Shamsul Hoque told reporters.

The demonstrations began Tuesday, when an International Crimes Tribunal sentenced Abdul Quader Mollah, assistant secretary general for the Jamaat-e-Islami party, to life in prison.
The Jamaat-e-Islami party had called for a two-day general strike across Bangladesh beginning Tuesday, and demonstrators clashed with police and demanded that ruling party officials scrap the trial process.
The government on Tuesday evening called in paramilitary troopers to maintain law and order in Dhaka and elsewhere as deadly protests erupted after the verdict.
Jamaat-e-Islami protested the verdict as demonstrators -- including some from ruling party alliances -- took to the streets demanding the death penalty for Mollah.

"We've deployed troopers from the Border Guards of Bangladesh to maintain law and order," Hoque said.
Hundreds of Dhaka University students took to the streets in the capital's Shahbagh Square, where they were joined by other city residents in protests that began Tuesday.
Home Ministry officials said security forces were patrolling in Dhaka and other major cities, including in the large southeastern port city of Chittagong, where at least four people were killed Tuesday during clashes between police and supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami.
Police opened fire and shot tear-gas shells to disperse the protesters, who torched and otherwise damaged more than 100 vehicles in major cities.
Jamaat-e-Islami said its members would continue to protest; many of its leaders are behind bars facing charges of murder, arson, looting and rape stemming from the war of independence in 1971.

They said the war-crimes trials, which began after more than 40 years of independence, was done with "ill political motive."
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina showed no sign of backing down, saying the trials would be completed at any cost.
The government, which promised in its election pledges in 2008 to complete the war-crimes trials, set up the tribunals in 2010.
Amid tight security, a three-member panel of judges of the International Crimes Tribunal-2 delivered the judgment against Mollah in a crowded courtroom on Tuesday.
Mollah, 64, was found guilty of five of six charges, including murder.
They included crimes against humanity, tribunal Chairman Justice Obaidul Hassan said.
After the verdict was read, Mollah stood from the chair on which he had been seated and cried, "Allahu Akbar!" (God is Great!)
He declared he was innocent and began to curse the judges and the government.
He then pulled a copy of the Quran from his pocket and held it in front of him, saying that the judges would one day find themselves on trial in accordance with the holy book's law.
Lawmakers of the ruling party alliance criticized the verdict in parliament and asked the prosecution to appeal for the death penalty.
Mollah, who was the chief of the students' wing of Jamaat-e-Islami in 1971, is the first Jamaat-e-Islami leader convicted in a war-crimes case by the tribunal.
On January 21, the same tribunal sentenced to death the first war crimes convict, Abul Kalam Azad, alias Bachchu Razakar.
Bangladesh had been the eastern portion of Pakistan until it gained independence in 1971 in a war that killed 3 million people.

Support swells for trooper who released Boston bombing suspect photos By Ashley Fantz, CNN
updated 9:33 PM EDT, Mon July 22, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Sgt. Sean Murphy will face a hearing Tuesday, Massachusetts State Police spokesman said
He was suspended for releasing unauthorized photos of alleged Boston bomber hunt and arrest
Boston magazine published images in stark contrast to controversial Rolling Stone cover (CNN) -- In the span of a few days, more than 51,000 people have thrown their support behind a Massachusetts State Police trooper who was temporarily suspended for giving Boston magazine photos of the hunt and capture of one of the Boston bombing suspects.
Sgt. Sean Murphy, who was suspended for a day last week for releasing the photos without authorization, will face a closed hearing Tuesday to determine his professional future with the agency, said state police spokesman David Procopio.
Boston magazine published what it said were Murphy's images in a story last week. The piece quoted Murphy as saying that he felt the Rolling Stone cover image -- showing a doe-eyed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with tousled hair -- was an insult to the victims of the April bombings.
What do you think of the Rolling Stone cover?
Boston magazine said it received images that Murphy, a tactical photographer, took of the hunt and capture of the alleged Boston bomber.
Bombings at the Boston Marathon on Monday, April 15, followed by a manhunt kept the Boston area reeling until the surviving suspect was captured on Friday, April 19. Pictured, the second explosion goes off near the marathon finish line on Monday while smoke from the first bomb still hangs in the air. Here's a look at how the week unfolded: A man comforts a victim on the sidewalk at the scene of the first explosion April 15 near the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon. The two explosions killed three people and wounded more than 170 others.
Runners react near Kenmore Square after two successive explosions at the marathon.
Rescue workers tend to the wounded on the scene. First responders tried to save lives and limbs before transporting victims to hospitals.
People gather Tuesday, April 16, at Garvey Park in Boston for a vigil for 8-year-old Martin Richard, killed by one of the bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager from Medford, Massachusetts, and Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old Chinese national attending graduate school at Boston University, also were killed in the bombings.
A young runner, left, collects his thoughts on Tuesday, April 16, in a church blocks away from the scene of the bombing attack at the Boston Marathon. The city was quiet the day after the tragedy.
On Wednesday, April 17, a federal law enforcement source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation told CNN that a lid to a pressure cooker thought to have been used in the bombings had been found on a roof of a building near the scene. It was one of several pieces of evidence authorities found.
The device also had fragments including nails, BBs and ball bearings, the FBI said.
On Thursday, April 18, the FBI released photos and video of two suspects in the bombings and asked for public help identifying them. The FBI later identified the suspects as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev.
FBI Suspect No. 2, later said to be Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is apparently seen in this picture, far left in white cap, from Boston Marathon runner David Green at the scene of the bombings on Monday, April 15.
The man identified as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev appears in a tighter crop of David Green's photo. Green submitted the photo to the FBI, he told CNN's Piers Morgan in an interview.
Late on the night of Thursday, April 18, police responded to a call that a campus officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was shot and killed. Police say a man later reported being carjacked by the brothers. The two are stopped in Watertown, where police said they threw explosives and shot at the officers. One man, assumed to be Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, drives off and the other, later identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is injured and later dies at the hospital. Shown is the scene early Friday in Watertown, Massachusetts, after the gunbattle between police and the suspects.
Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis speaks to the media in Watertown on April 19 and explains that the city is on lockdown until the surviving suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is found. The manhunt begins.
Officers scoured Watertown, where Dhokhar Tsarnaev was last seen. A Massachusetts State Trooper checks a building along Mount Auburn Street in Watertown.
Frightened residents were questioned near the home of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, on Norfolk Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
SWAT teams conducted door-to-door searches in Watertown while looking for the suspect.
Ruslan Tsarni, uncle of the Boston bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, urges the brothers to turn themselves in. In an interview Friday, April 19, outside his home in Montgomery Village, Maryland, he calls the bombers "losers." SWAT teams continue to search for the man identified by the FBI as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Friday, April 19, in Watertown, Massachusetts. The lockdown for the Boston area is lifted at 6 p.m., meaning people can again leave their homes, even though a suspect remains at large. On the evening of April 19, a Watertown resident reports seeing a man on a boat in his backyard and calls the police. Residents ran from the area where police say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was hiding on Franklin Street in Watertown, Massachusetts, on April 19.
Helicopters with infrared devices detect a man under the boat tarp. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's frame is seen in this thermal image released by Massachusetts State Police.
Police throw "flash-bangs" devices -- meant to stun people with a loud noise -- at the boat and start negotiations with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. He eventually surrenders and is transported to a local hospital in "serious condition."
People wave U.S. flags as police drive down the street in Watertown on Friday around 9 p.m. after it was announced that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been captured.

Boston bombings: A week in photos
Boston officer suspended over photos
McCain: Rolling Stone cover 'stupid'
Rolling Stone cover rocks the nation
"I hope that the people who see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets," Boston magazine quotes Murphy as saying alongside numerous images, including one of the suspect appearing bloody, looking down, his shirt raised and what looks like a red dot laser trained on his forehead.
"This guy is evil," Murphy told Boston magazine. "This is the real Boston bomber. Not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of Rolling Stone magazine."
A day before three commissioned officers will decide if the sergeant will remain on full or restricted duty pending an investigation or suspended with or without pay during a probe, there was very little hair-splitting on "Save Sgt. Murphy" about how people feel.
"If the powers that be do the right thing, they'll give Sgt. Murphy a medal, a long weekend off with pay, a new camera, and an apology," Richard C. Martin posted on the Facebook page. His comment alone garnered 160 likes.
"I support Sgt Murphy for standing up for the victims," posted John W. Patterson, "he's a true hero for doing what he thinks is right."
But there were a few people who understood why the trooper was in trouble.
Darin Vance, a 16-year-old from West Virginia posted, "I hate to see him lose his job, but what he did really was illegal; those pictures were not his, since he took them for his employer. Therefore, legally speaking, he stole the picture, and published it. I guess it depends how his contract was set up, but I think all copyrights would have been given over to the state..."
Vance reiterated his support for the trooper to CNN Monday and said that he worried that the Rolling Stone cover might inspire someone to commit an act of terror hoping to land on the cover of a legendary magazine.
On Monday CNN reached a woman who said she was the organizer of the page but would only give a first name -- Lisa. She said that she felt compelled to create the page because her own father was a Massachusetts State Police trooper.
"I thought this page would only be popular among my friends, but I'm getting private messages from people across the country, in Germany and in England, all over, who believe this trooper did the right thing," she said. "I was so angry when I heard that Sgt. Murphy was going to suffer for trying to stand up for victims."
Fast Facts: Boston Terror Attack
Before quoting Murphy in several long passages, Boston magazine wrote: "Here, in his own words, Murphy shares his thoughts on the Rolling Stone cover. He stresses that he is speaking strictly for himself and not as a representative of the Massachusetts State Police."
John Wolfson, Boston magazine's editor in chief, said the magazine has hundreds of photos similar to the ones Murphy provided and will publish more in its September issue.
He said Murphy was "conflicted on some level" about releasing the photos, but "genuinely worried" about how the Rolling Stone cover will affect the victims' families.
The Rolling Stone cover unleashed a wave of intense reaction on social media, which played out in brick-and-mortar stores. Three prominent New England-based businesses -- CVS pharmacies, Stop & Stop, and Tedeschi Food Shops -- heard the public outcry and announced they would not sell the print edition of the magazine. The 7-Eleven corporation said Thursday its nearly 1,700 company stores across the country won't sell the issue.

Some have defended the cover, arguing that it draws much needed attention to a young man who seemed an unlikely terrorist and makes us all reconsider our ideas of what a terrorist would look like. Rolling Stone issued a statement saying that the story "falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage..."
"The fact that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is young, and in the same age group as many of our readers," the statement read, "makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain a more complete understanding of how a tragedy like this happens."
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in connection with bombings and is awaiting trial. His brother Tamerlan, suspected to have helped carry out the attack, was killed during a gun battle with police.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
George W. Bush goes on "The Tonight Show"; Bill Clinton gets Medal of Freedom
Julian Zelizer: The two are taking opposite approaches to managing presidential legacies
Clinton takes initiative in pushing his view of how Democratic Party should act, Zelizer says
Zelizer: Bush takes more passive role, letting his controversial record speak for itself Editor's note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of "Jimmy Carter" and "Governing America."
(CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush briefly jumped back into the national conversation Tuesday night with his interview on "The Tonight Show." Bush told host Jay Leno that "I don't miss the spotlight" and that he was thoroughly enjoying his post-presidential life. On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton is in the news as he receives a Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama.
The two former presidents have taken a very different approach to their time after the White House. In an era when former presidents are often younger and healthier than in the past, the post-presidency offers a huge opportunity for them to help shape their legacies.
Julian Zelizer
Former President Jimmy Carter raised the bar after he lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980. Rather than going into political hiding, the Georgian launched the Carter Center, which has been a hub of international diplomacy. Carter remained an important voice in discussions about foreign policy and has even played a role in resolving some tense diplomatic situations.
Clinton's approach to life after the White House has reflected his general style of politics. Clinton has never been passive. As governor of Arkansas and as president of the United States, Clinton has believed it is essential to maintain an aggressive and proactive stance.
In an era when many Democrats felt defensive about their ideas, Clinton never let his opponents define him. He responded to every attack throughout his presidency by going on the attack and tried to influence the national conversation about how he was doing.
Obama and Clinton: Bros or foes?

See George W. Bush's painting for Leno
When Republicans shut down the government in 1995 claiming to be fiscally responsible, Clinton turned the tables on them by depicting them as politically reckless. When House Republicans moved to impeach him for perjury in 1997 and 1998, Clinton painted his opponents as partisan zealots who were using the constitutional process for crass political ends.
Since 2000, Clinton has continued to inject himself into the political arena. Understanding that presidential legacies evolve in real time, Clinton has remained a forceful presence in the Democratic Party. He has worked hard to strengthen his image as an effective partisan fighter who knows, and knew, how to make things work in a dysfunctional political period.
During the 2008 campaign, while supporting his wife's candidacy he promoted a vision of Democratic politics that he said would be most effective in getting things done in Washington.
After Obama won office, Clinton made his peace with the President and in 2012 was one of the most effective advocates for the White House by articulating a powerful critique of Republican economic policies.
President Barack Obama with ex-Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter in Dallas. In recent weeks, Clinton spoke out on the health care program, urging Obama to honor his commitment for people to keep their insurance plans and aiming to shore up Democrats as they have struggled through the problematic rollout of the Affordable Care Act.
Not only does Clinton want to demonstrate his political skills, but he remains devoted to a Democratic Party that is strong and effective -- which in his mind would be the best proof that his term in office helped to revitalize a party that had been politically devastated in the Age of Reagan. Clinton also would like his wife to be elected president so as to create a political dynasty of sorts.
Bush has taken a different approach, letting his record stand on its own. Bush left the White House hugely unpopular and controversial. Bush had little appetite for the toxic environment of Washington and has been remarkably quiet since leaving. Although Americans saw some of him following the release of his book and in relationship to the opening of his presidential library, that's about it.
The strategy follows the kind of politician he was. Bush liked to call himself "The Decider" and in many ways he was. Bush preferred to make decisions and let them stick, regardless of how controversial or problematic they were.
Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and ex-Presidents Clinton and Carter at the March on Washington's 50th anniversary. We have seen the same strategy in his post-presidential career. Rather than being part of the political conversation and trying to shape his party in the years that followed, Bush has let the record speak for itself. By many accounts, he has watched as the GOP moved rightward despite his own inclinations about what would be best for the future of the party.
Each strategy carries its rewards and risks. For Clinton, his stance allows him to be part of the conversation and to try to make sure that his party remains in a strong position. He can paint himself in a good light as people examine what he was doing as president. The danger is that his actions make him a target of controversy and that by making himself so doggedly political he undermines the aura of a statesman that has been so beneficial to rebuilding the damaged image Americans often have of their leaders.
During the 2008 presidential campaign, criticism from the African-American community about his statements regarding Obama weakened some of the strong support that the community held toward his presidency.
For Bush, the benefit of his relative silence is that he avoids all of the pitfalls that face Clinton. As feelings about him start to soften simply because we are further removed from his presidency, he has created the space for more careful and rigorous analysis of what he did during the White House. By showing how difficult the political environment is regardless of whether he is in office, Bush can allow for more sympathy to develop of challenges he faced.
The dangers for Bush are twofold. By being so removed, he can convey a level of dispassion for politics that plays into criticism that it was never a job he was driven to do in the first place. He has also failed to play a forceful role as his party plunges in its approval ratings.
Presidential legacies are a tough thing to predict. Like the weather in New England, they change by the minute.
As the nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assassination, we can see how presidential reputations fluctuate dramatically (historians often remember his failures as president, while many others recall his presidency in heroic terms). But in this day and age, former presidents have significant opportunities to shape how the nation remembers them and to influence the political world in which they will be judged during their lifetime.
As Obama reaches the final period of his presidency, he would do well to look at what his predecessors have done and start thinking through what his strategy will be in the years ahead.

From the Warp CNN vault: Barry Bonds
A blast from the past. Back in April, as the baseball season was just getting underway, we asked three of our I-Report cartoonists to offer their unique look at Giants slugger Barry Bonds. It seemed topical then, but even more so now. For those of you still reading Harry Potter book 7 -- Bonds passed Hank Aaron this week on the all-time home run list. Oh yeah, Bonds is also a key figure in the BALCO scandal. A number of journalists have alleged that Bonds has used performance-enhancing substances. Bonds denies those claims, and has not been charged with any crime in connection with steroids or the BALCO incident.Anyway, check out all three toons, then let us know which one you think hits closest to the mark -- and why -- by posting a comment. Better yet, send your own cartoon response. Take 1: 'Heroes' From cartoonist Brixton Doyle See more of his work Take 2: 'The Bonds Effect' From cartoonist Jim Brenneman See more of his work Take 3: 'Bonds-Aid’ From cartoonist Dean Turnbloom See more of his work OK, now we want to hear from you. Tell us which cartoon is best by sending a comment, or better yet, pick up your pen and draw your own take on this week's topic.
