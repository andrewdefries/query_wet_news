Germany charges 3 for Iraq PM plotBy CNN Correspondent Chris Burns
Allawi was in Berlin at the time of the alleged plot. BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- Three suspects have been charged in Germany over an alleged December 2004 plot to kill then-Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi during a visit to the country. The three were identified as a ringleader and two suspected members of Ansar Al Islam, a Kurdish militant group that has largely been overshadowed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's al Qaeda in Iraq. Their names were listed as Ata A. R., 31, of Stuttgart, Mazen A.H., 23, of Augsburg, and Rafik M.Y., 31, of Berlin. The prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe did not elaborate on their names in a statement Tuesday. The three plotted to kill Allawi at a Deutsche Bank reception in Berlin on December 3 last year, the prosecutor's office said. Police foiled the plot by arresting them that morning.All three, who were charged last Thursday by German federal prosecutors, were also accused of providing logistical support, collecting and sending funds, to Ansar Al Islam, the statement said. Ata R. and Rafik M.Y. also sought to recruit suicide bombers for Iraq, the statement said. Story Tools

What's new on Capitol Hill? MotherhoodStory Highlights Pelosi: "Dream come true" that several new moms are serving in Congress Working mothers of Capitol Hill juggle legislating with day care and breast-feeding "Sometimes I need to get creative," says Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin Rep. Linda Sanchez about to become eighth woman to give birth while in office Next Article in Living » Read VIDEO By Dana Bash CNN Senior Congressional Correspondent	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- At 8:30 a.m., Kirsten Gillibrand looks like any other working mom in a minivan dropping off her baby boy at day care and her other son at school. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and her 11-month old son Henry. But one hour later, she is gaveling the United States Senate into session. Sen. Gillibrand, D-New York, is part of a different kind of "change" in Washington -- a baby boom among female lawmakers. She had her son Henry 11 months ago, when she was serving in the House of Representatives. "I think it makes me and the other women better legislators, because we really understand some of the struggles that other moms and other families have," Gillibrand said. Watch more from Gillibrand on other moms » Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, D-South Dakota, had her first baby, Zachary, 5 months ago. Even though she's a member of Congress, she has to wait her turn on a waiting list with other Capitol Hill employees at the congressional day care center, which is at capacity. Until he can get in, Henry usually spends his days with a nanny or family. Don't Miss In Depth: Having It All
Like Gillibrand, Herseth Sandlin juggles legislating with breast-feeding. "Sometimes I need to get creative," Herseth Sandlin said. "We try to carve out that 20 minutes, but there will be a series of votes; I've got constituents waiting. Sometimes I take my black bag with my breast pump over to the Capitol in the Ladies' Reading Room." Watch more from Herseth Sandlin about life as a lawmaker mom » Herseth Sandlin is only the seventh lawmaker in U.S. history to give birth while serving in Congress. Gillibrand was the sixth. It's a relatively new dynamic for women in politics, because most used to take the path followed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California -- have children first, then run for office. But during the past several years, there has been a concerted effort in both parties to recruit younger women. "When you look at public service earlier it means you have children while we're serving," said Gillibrand, "and it's exciting, and I think it's good for the Congress." Herseth Sandlin agreed. "Our approach to policies that were important to us before become even more important, whether it's early childhood development and how you fund it, child-care, quality child-care, child nutrition, prenatal care," said Herseth Sandlin. Watch more from Herseth Sandlin on child-care policy » Both women admit it's easier for them than most moms to balance babies and work, because they're the bosses and -- for the most part -- can decide when to schedule meetings or travel back to their home states. "When I was working all hours at a law firm in New York City, a lady would come in and start cleaning the offices at 8 p.m. Where are her kids? How hard is it for her to manage her schedule?" asked Gillibrand. Watch more from Gillibrand on her motherhood experience » But members of Congress do sometimes have late-night votes, and their arduous campaign schedules create unique challenges. Both Gillibrand and Herseth Sandlin said they rely heavily on their parents, grandparents and other family members to help with their children. The lawmakers also help each other. "As all women do, we talk all the time," said Gillibrand. "Any time you need advice, you know, who do you ask? You ask your girlfriends." In fact, she and Herseth Sandlin recently attended a baby shower for Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-California. Watch the full story on the baby boom on Capitol Hill » Later this month, Sanchez is due to become the eighth woman in two centuries of congressional history to have a baby while serving. It's a sign of the changing times, and a source of pride for history's first female U.S. House speaker. "To have new moms in the House is really a dream come true," said Pelosi during a recent news conference. "It's a real message to working moms and young moms across America that someone who shares their experience and their aspirations for their children is a voice for them in the Congress."

Arab League calls meeting on Syria demands
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 1:15 PM EST, Tue December 6, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: No date or place for the meeting is set, Arab League source says
NEW: U.S. sends ambassador back to Syria
At least 30 people were killed Tuesday in Homs, group says
Syria says it will let Arab League observers in, but wants sanctions lifted (CNN) -- Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Arabi called for a meeting of foreign ministers to consider their response to Syria's conditional agreement to allow observers into the country, according to a source close to the secretary-general.
No date or location has been revealed, but the call for the league meeting came a day after Syria said it would allow the observers in on the condition that the league immediately drop sanctions and agree to amendments that league officials have previously rejected.
"The Syrians' acceptance of the protocol does not mean that we will suspend the sanctions," el-Arabi told CNN on Monday.
Arab League officials met with Syrian opposition groups in Cairo on Tuesday, the same source said.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held a rare meeting with leaders of a leading Syrian opposition group Tuesday, a sign of the Obama administration's deepening engagement with political dissidents seeking to oust embattled President Bashar al-Assad.
Clinton invited activists belonging to the Syrian National Council to discuss their plans to establish a new democratic government in Syria and reach out to Syria's minorities, many of whom remain loyal to the Assad regime.
"Obviously, a democratic transition is more than removing the Assad regime," she told them. "It means setting Syria on the path of the rule of law and protecting the universal rights of all citizens regardless of sect or ethnicity or gender."
Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi told reporters Monday that Syria is committed to reforms to end the crisis, pointing to decisions to pull back some troops and release some prisoners as evidence.
U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford headed back to Damascus, after leaving in October amid threats to his safety. Syria followed suit by recalling its ambassador to Washington.
Ford had antagonized the Syrian government with outspoken criticism of the regime and support for the protesters. Before he left, al-Assad supporters attacked the U.S. Embassy and the ambassador's convoy.
State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Ford's return "is among the most effective ways to send the message that the United States stands with the people of Syria."
"He will continue the work he was doing previously," Toner said. "Namely, delivering the United States' message to the people of Syria; providing reliable reporting on the situation on the ground; and engaging with the full spectrum of Syrian society on how to end the bloodshed and achieve a peaceful political transition."
The Local Coordinating Committees of Syria, an opposition umbrella group, said 31 people had been killed Tuesday. All but one of the deaths occurred in the city of Homs, the scene of much of the recent unrest, the group said.
The United Nations estimates more than 4,000 people have been killed in Syria since February, when al-Assad began attempting to put down anti-government protests with police and troops. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 34 civilians died in Homs on Monday.
CNN is unable to verify the reports because Syrian officials have restricted access to the country by reporters.
Syrian officials say they are battling "armed terrorist gangs" that prey on civilians. But the crackdown has led to widespread criticism throughout the region and economic sanctions by the Arab League and neighboring Turkey.
Syria is among the Middle Eastern and North African countries wracked by the "Arab Spring" demonstrations that arose after the revolt that toppled Tunisia's longtime strongman in January. Subsequent uprisings ousted two of the region's longtime autocrats, Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Moammar Gadhafi in Libya, while Yemen's Ali Abdullah Saleh has signed an agreement to step down by February in the face of widespread unrest there.
Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are risking their future ties with Syria by supporting al-Assad now, the head of a leading Syrian opposition group says.
Burhan Ghalioun, the chairman of the Syrian National Council, told CNN in an interview airing Tuesday that Iran is "participating in suppressing the Syrian people" by backing al-Assad, whose family's 40-year regime has been a longtime Iranian ally. He also warned that the crackdown could lead to international military intervention.
"I hope that Iranians realize the importance of not compromising the Syrian-Iranian relationship by defending a regime whose own people clearly reject it and has become a regime of torture to its own people," Ghalioun said. Tehran must understand "that this is the last chance to avoid an unwanted fate to the Syrian-Iranian relationship," he said.
As for Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia that was allied with Syria during the years that Damascus dominated its smaller neighbor, Ghalioun said, "The Syrian people stood completely by Hezbollah once. But today, they are surprised that Hezbollah did not return the favor and support the Syrian's people struggle for freedom."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Police: A death at the residence of the Swedish prime minister is not linked to terrorism

Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt was not present when the death occurred, his office says
(CNN) -- A man has died in an incident at the official residence of Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt in Stockholm, Swedish police confirmed Friday.
The incident is not being treated as terrorism, and the man who died is not connected with the Swedish government, a police spokeswoman said.
Investigations are continuing into the circumstances of his death. His family still has to be informed, police said.
Reinfeldt was not at the residence at the time of the incident, spokesman Markus Friberg told CNN.
"I can confirm that the prime minister was not in the building; he was in a meeting in another place. He and his family are fine. Police are trying to get more details about this incident," Friberg said.

Magazine vows to print pics of pregnant, bikini-clad Duchess of Cambridge
By Greg Botelho and Susannah Palk, CNN
updated 4:11 PM EST, Tue February 12, 2013
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave a hospital where she was treated for acute morning sickness in January. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The Italian magazine, Chi, says it will print photos of the Duchess of Cambridge on holiday
The photos show her in "a small bikini that enhances her now visible (baby) bump," Chi says
A disappointed St. James's Palace says the pics violate her privacy
Chi was among the publications to run photos of Catherine sunbathing topless last year
London (CNN) -- The Duchess of Cambridge has been photographed furtively once again: An Italian magazine announced Tuesday it will publish vacation photos of the pregnant royal and her baby bump, despite her objection.
The magazine, Chi, said Tuesday that it will print "extraordinary images of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their dream holiday in the Caribbean" in the issue coming out Wednesday.
"The future mum, now in her fourth month of pregnancy, wears a small bikini that enhances her now visible bump," the magazine said.
St. James's Palace -- which represents Catherine, her husband, Prince William, and his brother, Harry -- responded with dismay.
"We are disappointed that photographs of the Duke and Duchess on a private holiday look likely to be published overseas," a palace representative said. "This is a clear breach of the couple's right to privacy."
Duchess of Cambridge's fashion secrets
A royal baby on the way
It was not immediately clear when or exactly where the pictures were taken. British and U.S. media -- including People, like CNN a division of Time Warner -- reported that the royal couple recently vacationed on the secluded Caribbean isle of Mustique.
The Duchess, whose maiden name is Kate Middleton, has kept a low profile since the announcement in December she is set to give birth to her first child in July. Images showing any evidence of a baby bump have been hard to come by in that time.
The Chi photos, though, are not her first encounter with paparazzi -- which tracked her during her long courtship with William, their engagement and their time since April 2011 as a married couple.
The highest-profile example came in September 2012, when the French magazine Closer ran photographs of Catherine privately sunbathing topless while on a holiday with William in France.
Besides that magazine, some of those photos also were published in the Irish Daily Star newspaper and Chi, which according to its parent company Mondadori is a women's magazine with an average circulation of more than 218,000 and a readership well beyond that.
Soon after the photos came out, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took legal action against Closer -- which was fined by a French court and ordered not to distribute the edition in print or online. It was also told to hand over the photos to the royals.
CNN's Susannah Palk reported this story from London, and Greg Botelho wrote it from Atlanta. CNN's Gisella Deputato contributed to this report.

Navy catapults drone from aircraft carrier
By Brad Lendon, CNN
updated 4:54 PM EDT, Wed May 15, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The launch from the USS George H.W. Bush is called a "watershed event"
The drone landed at an air station in Maryland after a 65-minute flight
The Navy hopes to land a drone on a carrier this summer
(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has pulled off what the service's "air boss" called "a watershed event," launching a drone from an aircraft carrier.
The X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS) demonstrator completed a catapult launch from the USS George H.W. Bush off the coast of Virginia Tuesday morning.
"Today we saw a small, but significant pixel in the future picture of our Navy as we begin integration of unmanned systems into arguably the most complex warfighting environment that exists today: the flight deck of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier," the "air boss," Vice Adm. David Buss, commander of Naval Air Forces, said in a statement.
An X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System demonstrator leaves the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush on Tuesday, May 14. The drone, propelled by a catapult, was the first to be launched from an aircraft carrier.
The drone demonstrator is loaded onto an aircraft elevator in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia.
The drone taxis on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier.

Dave Lorenz, a deck operator for Northrop Grumman, has control of the drone as he moves it via an arm-mounted controller.

Photos: Drone launches from aircraft carrier
CNN Explains: Drones
The drone landed at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, after a 65-minute flight around Chesapeake Bay, the Navy said.
"The flight today demonstrated that the X-47B is capable of operation from a carrier, hand-off from one mission control station to another, flight through the national airspace, and recovery at another location without degradation in safety or precision," Matt Funk, the lead engineer for the UCAS program, said in statement.
The next milestone will be landing the craft back on the carrier as the flight deck pitches in the open sea, something onboard pilots consider one of the most difficult things they do. That may come sometime this summer, the Navy statement said.

Jason Collins came out; NBA should let him play
By Jeff Pearlman, Special to CNN
updated 8:20 AM EDT, Thu October 17, 2013
Jason Collins, who played with the NBA's Washington Wizards this season, has disclosed that he is gay, making him the first active openly homosexual athlete in the four major American pro team sports. Collins (No. 33) played college ball for Stanford, here against Maryland in 1998. He has been in the NBA for 12 seasons. With the New Jersey Nets, Collins guards the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal in 2002 in Los Angeles. Collins played for the Nets from 2002 through 2008.
Collins and his twin brother, Jarron, pose for a portrait during the 2004 NBA All-Star Weekend. Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic steals the ball from the Nets' Collins in 2005 in Orlando, Florida.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Jeff Pearlman: NBA player Jason Collins came out in April and his move drew support
Collins has yet to be signed; where did all that support go?
He grants Collins' game is off, but lesser players have been invited to training camp
Pearlman: NBA missing chance to give Collins' courageous move the conclusion it deserves
Editor's note: Jeff Pearlman blogs at jeffpearlman.com. His most recent book is "Sweetness: The Enigmatic Life of Walter Payton." Follow him on twitter @jeffpearlman.
(CNN) -- It was merely a dream, wasn't it?
That whole Jason Collins thing of six months ago -- never happened, right? The headline news of his becoming the first openly gay active male professional athlete in a team sport. The Sports Illustrated cover. The supportive tweets from everyone ranging from Barack Obama and Bill Clinton to Jason Kidd and LeBron James. The interviews. The raves ("Game-changing!"). The altered landscape.
Remember when The Guardian newspaper called Collins' emergence significant for LGBT acceptance ... "as professional sports had long been seen as the final frontier"?
Remember when the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network presented Collins with its courage award? Remember when the veteran NBA center was being likened to Jackie Robinson?
Jeff Pearlman
Well, eh, forget it. Forget the whole thing.
As you read this, Collins is likely sitting somewhere inside his California home, twiddling his thumbs, watching reality TV, waiting, hoping, waiting, hoping, waiting, hoping for the groundbreaking opportunity that looks, increasingly, unlikely to occur. Put differently: For one to actually become the first openly gay active male professional athlete in a team sport, one must be an openly gay active male professional athlete playing a team sport.
And Collins ain't playing squat.
With the NBA opening in less than two weeks, it has become clear that the league's 30 teams have no interest in Collins, a 34-year-old journeyman. From a purely basketball standpoint, this is understandable: Once a valuable role player on a New Jersey Nets team that reached back to back NBA Championship series in the early 2000s, Collins is a shell of his former self.
Playing with Boston and Washington last season, he averaged but 1.1 points and 1.6 rebounds in 38 games. He is -- to be blunt -- a slow, nonathletic player with creaky joints and no offensive repertoire of which to speak. Were this any other similarly submediocre player in any other sport, his departure would register nary a blip on the radar. He would vanish, and life would move on.
Costas: Collins is 'the perfect guy'
Collins: I'm the happiest I've ever been
'We planned our lives together'
Jason Collins, however, ceased being ordinary the moment he announced he was gay.
To thousands upon thousands of Americans, he became a beacon of hope and a sign that maybe sexuality would matter not the in machismo-stuffed world of professional sports. If LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and Chris Paul could embrace a gay man as a teammate, what excuse would the loudmouth, homophobic blockhead at the construction site or law firm have for his close-mindedness?
Finally, things were about to change.
Only they weren't because, well, nobody called. The NBA has been repeatedly defended in its inaction with predictable attacks on Collins' game -- too slow, too marginal, too worthless. Yet could somebody (anybody?) have at least invited him to training camp -- land of myriad oafs and fringe players itching to land a job?
Hell, the Los Angeles Lakers' preseason roster included Dan Gadzuric and Eric Boateng, two men with limited skill sets and without Collins' great teammate/dogged worker resume. Hell, the Atlanta Hawks briefly employed David Lighty, a 6-foot-6 shooting guard with no redeeming NBA attributes. Hell, the New York Knicks, according to NBC Sports' D.J. Foster, "have basically worked out everyone who has ever touched a basketball this offseason." Everyone save Collins.
This isn't a hard one to figure out.
As the late Branch Rickey of baseball fame repeatedly pointed out, change within the sports landscape doesn't come easily.
Just as members of the Brooklyn Dodgers were loathe to share locker space with Robinson in the summer of 1947, many NBA players (whether they admit it publicly or not) were likely not thrilled by the idea of showering alongside a gay man even if they'd been showering alongside said gay man for more than a decade.
Adding Collins to a roster -- even a preseason roster -- would likely have meant awkwardness, confusion and weirdness.
There almost inevitably would have been conservative Christian teammates asking to change in a designated private space. Special press conferences would need to be arranged.
Gay rights groups would flock to the arena -- and they'd be loud. And what of the slurs that fly across courts during practice with staggering regularity, and without much thought? What would happen the first time a Clipper or Piston or Spur uttered the word "f****t," even if it were not directed at Collins?
Could all this trouble (and it would, inevitably, be trouble) be worth it for at best a seldom-used 12th man?
Answer: Absolutely.
Opportunities like this don't happen often, and the NBA -- arguably the most progressive of the four major American team sports -- is failing miserably.
Where is Kidd, the Nets' new coach and former Collins' teammate, with a camp invite? Where is Mark Cuban, the forward-thinking Dallas Mavericks owner, with a pen and a contract? Where are the Golden State Warriors, the team whose arena is 18 miles from the spot where Harvey Milk was murdered? Where are the Lakers, a franchise desperately in need in grit and toughness? Where are the Miami Heat, whose bench could use a bruiser of Collins' ilk?
How in the world could no one think to add Collins to a roster, if only to give his courageous first step the conclusion it deserves?
How are we letting this one slip away?

'My son is mentally ill,' so listen up
He is 14 and hears voices. He's been hospitalized more than 20 times. Stephanie Escamilla is tired of seeing the country focus on the mentally ill only when there's a national tragedy. So she and her son are telling their story — of a family on the brink.
By Wayne Drash
Video and photography by Evelio Contreras
San Antonio, Texas (CNN)
The boy wears SpongeBob pajamas and sits up in bed, a blanket draped over his shoulders. In his right hand he holds a rosary.
"Please, please, please help me," he whimpers. Imaginary voices bark at him. "Go away," he tells them. "Go away! Go away!" He screams for his mother: "They're making me have these bad thoughts." Stephanie Escamilla is videotaping her son Daniel. He is 10. Nobody believes her when she says he hears voices. This tape will be her proof. When the voices come, they tell Daniel to kill his brother, his mother and himself. Sometimes he turns the TV on full blast to drown out their commands. Or sprinkles holy water around his bed. As the camera rolls, Stephanie calls psychiatric hospitals near her home in San Antonio. Repeatedly she is turned down. Nothing can be done for her son, she is told, unless "he is a danger to himself or others." It is December 2009, and Daniel's hallucinations last more than two hours.

Daniel is 14 now, and his mother no longer needs to convince doctors that he is mentally ill. He suffers from bipolar disorder with psychosis. In the past four years, he has been hospitalized more than 20 times.	But a diagnosis merely marks a beginning. Raising a child with mental illness is "a roller-coaster ride through hell," Stephanie says. She is engaged in an epic battle on multiple fronts.
What if Daniel has an outburst in public and is misunderstood? What if he succumbs to the voices? How can she help Daniel find joy?
And what about the rest of her family? They need her, too.
With broad shoulders and a thick frame, Stephanie looks the part of a worthy combatant and strong advocate. It wasn't always this way. She was a single mother with self-doubt, quick to blame herself for Daniel's plight. Imagine what it's like for a mother to watch her son suffer – the little boy who sang and danced to Michael Jackson tunes, who tossed the baseball out back, who she dreamed would become a doctor. Think how painful it is to hear him say nearly every day that he wants to kill himself.
Stephanie's fight is literally one of life and death – a desperate attempt to win back her son from the mental illness trying to consume him.
She'll do whatever it takes to save Daniel.
One family's experience
The Navy Yard.
Newtown. Aurora.
Tucson. Virginia Tech.
The only time mental illness dominates the national conversation is when something goes tragically wrong. But the dialogue doesn't last. It gets buried under arguments about gun control, video game violence and unheeded signs of trouble -- until there's yet another mass shooting.

When Daniel feels he might have an episode of psychosis, he goes outside to ease his anxiety and to make sure he is not around his siblings.
"What we always say is we had the tragedies in Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut and Virginia," says Mike Fitzpatrick, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, "but there are smaller tragedies that happen every day in this country because people are untreated for mental illness. And they end up in jails, in homeless shelters – and families are torn apart."
Those small, quiet tragedies don't usually make headlines. The 75 million American families touched by mental illness, like Stephanie Escamilla's, largely deal with it in private. Every day.
It frays bonds, breaks up marriages. It steals hope.
People don't ask how to help boys like Daniel. It takes a James Holmes to grab the nation's attention. A Jared Loughner. An Adam Lanza.
Something has to be done about America's mentally ill.
That refrain emerged stronger than ever last December after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut. Never mind that no one knew whether it was mental illness that drove Lanza. He killed 26 people, including 20 children. Wasn't that the definition of madness?
I covered the tragedy in Newtown the week after the massacre and returned there a few times in the months that followed. A shuttered mental hospital overlooks the idyllic New England town; just down the hill sits a high-security prison housing the criminally insane. Standing there, I wondered about the state of our mental health system. I later learned the scope of the problem: More than 60 million adults and about 15 million children in America suffer some form of mental disorder. That's one in every four adults, one in five children. Far fewer live with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, but the numbers are still large: 13.6 million adults and about 2 million children. The mass shootings that shine a spotlight on mental illness actually stigmatize those who suffer with it. The vast majority, advocates point out, are far more likely to be the victims of violence – they often get beat up or bullied -- than to commit a violent act.
What if the issue could be seen through the prism of an average American family – not just through the lens of a national tragedy? What could be learned from people who deal with the day-to-day reality of mental illness?
I asked the largest nonprofit mental health advocacy group, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, to spread the word of my interest in telling that story. I recognized the hurdles. A family would open itself to scrutiny and, possibly, judgment – on top of everything else it faces.
"It is a risk factor for a marriage, for a family, to have a seriously ill child," says Ken Duckworth, medical director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Even for families who have resources and do everything right, it can take years to find the proper care, he says. But people who get that help can stabilize – and function in the world.
Duckworth cautions against drawing conclusions about the paths of children or teens with mental illness. "One person who loves you," he says, "can make all the difference."
Stephanie Escamilla believes that. She also believes complete strangers could make a difference if only they understood. That motivates her to try to teach people about what it's like to walk in her son's shoes. A board member of the San Antonio chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, she welcomed CNN into her home beginning in June. In the months that followed, I witnessed her resolve to change the path of a 14-year-old boy oscillating between the trials of adolescence and the anguish of mental illness.
It's not just her fight, or Daniel's. It touches the entire family. Stephanie, 37, and her fiancé, Jose Farias, 33, are raising three other children, ranging in age from 7 to 10, in their merged household. Also living with the family is Stephanie's mother, who has brain cancer.
Stephanie and Jose asked that CNN refer to their oldest son as Daniel; that is not his real name, and his last name is different from theirs. They also asked that CNN photograph him in a way that keeps his face hidden. Many in his hometown know Daniel has a mental illness, but the family didn't want that label to extend to the Internet, where it could dog him when he seeks a job or applies to college. If his illness has taught them anything, it's that people judge.
But Stephanie and Jose – and, indeed, Daniel – are willing to take that risk. By telling their story, they hope to help others raising a mentally ill child and shed light on mental illness for those who remain clueless.
Stephanie included Daniel in the decision to lay their lives bare.
"I'm going through a lot of stress and a lot of things that no kid should see, no kid should hear – and things you shouldn't do," he told me. "I just don't want anybody else to go through that."
If it's true that one person who loves you can change your outlook, that force in Daniel's life is his mother. Stephanie hasn't sold out her son's dreams. She believes he can accomplish whatever he sets out to do. Yet she worries for his future: Will people accept him? Will he adapt to the world around him? Will he someday live under a bridge?
'I thought I hated my son'
The lights go dim. Stephanie stands at the podium and shows a photograph of Daniel looking dapper with deep brown eyes, trimmed brown hair and a broad smile. It's a recent picture. The next one shows him at 6 months, dressed in a Dallas Cowboys bib and winter cap. "You would never know that he was going to have a mental illness," she tells the crowd. "I mean, does he look like he has one there?"
Seventeen cadets being trained to work in the Bexar County jail system sit in the audience and shake their heads. Several blurt out: "No."
"He was a baby," she says. "He was awesome. He was always happy."
On the day Daniel was born -- January 29, 1999 -- Stephanie eyed his tiny frame, all 5 pounds and 15 ounces, and marveled at how delicate he was. She felt a bond that touched her soul. She dreamed he would become a doctor, or join the military to explore the world. She was 23 and single. Raising a child alone, she knew, would not be easy. She promised her son one thing: I will always take care of you, no matter how hard it gets. The PowerPoint presentation moves to the next slide. This one, titled "Many Hospitalizations Thereafter," is jarring. It shows the dates of Daniel's hospitalizations:
-- 03/25/09
-- 12/11/09
-- 03/26/10
-- 04/29/10 ... On and on, the list goes: 17 in all. She tells the cadets the slide isn't up to date – the hospitalizations now number about 20.
"It is a roller-coaster ride," Stephanie says. "I don't know if any of you guys have anybody in the family that have mental illness or have dealt with anybody with mental illness, but it is a ride that no one wants to take."
Stephanie moved from the rural town of Uvalde, Texas, to San Antonio to gain better access to mental health treatment. She took an overnight job at a hospital so she could be around during the day for her son. She works in a tuberculosis ward and once was a 911 dispatcher. Those experiences gave her another view of the mentally ill – from medical and law enforcement perspectives. She realized she could help her son by educating others.
Two years ago, she did her first session for the Bexar County Sheriff's Office, which puts its personnel through mandatory crisis intervention training aimed at teaching the best ways to deal with the mentally ill.
The goal is to "de-escalate a situation and get people the help they need before going hands on and taking them to jail," says Cpl. Shannon Lunski, who helps lead the program. For these cadets, Stephanie puts a face on the struggle.
She tells them about her long and frustrating journey: Daniel was diagnosed with ADHD at age 6, his first manic meltdown came at 10, hospitals kept refusing to admit him "because he had not hurt himself and he had not hurt anybody, and he didn't have a plan" to act – the legal threshold required for hospital admittance.
She plays a video of Daniel enduring an episode of psychosis from May 1 of this year. His legs and arms shake while he sits on a picnic table in the backyard. He places his head between his knees. Then, he stands and paces. He swats the air. His head darts back and forth, as if trying to shake the demons he sees and hears.
"This doesn't happen all the time," she says. "It happens when he has something really stressful going on at school or he has a cycle. Sometimes, the cycle comes every two months; sometimes they're more frequent. I'm happy when they're gone for five months, but that hasn't happened for a while."
Stephanie's voice trembles. Some of the cadets cry. "You guys are my psychotherapists," she tells them. "Not a lot of people want to sit and hear you talk about mental illness."
She admits there were days when she wished she could just give her son away. She's ashamed of that thought now, but realizes she's only human. She turned her sorrow into action when she finally accepted Daniel's illness. It took time, and came only after she realized his condition was getting worse. She had an epiphany. "I thought I hated my son," she says. "But then I realized it wasn't him that I hated. It was his bipolar disorder."
Stephanie Escamilla became an advocate for those with mental illness after her son's condition worsened.
She implores the cadets to show compassion when they arrive at a scene involving a disruptive child.
"You're going to be walking up, and what's going to be your first reaction?" she asks.
"It's a kid acting bad," one cadet says.
"You're going to be judgmental, right? Is that actually how you should approach that?"
The cadet shakes his head. Think of families like hers, she tells them. "Put yourselves in their shoes. You have officers come into your house, would you want them to judge you?
"I tell you this because you're going to come across homeless people like that, who are schizophrenic, who have not been on meds and are hearing voices," she says. "Calm them down, talk to them. Tell them: 'It's just a voice. The voice isn't going to hurt you.'"
That's what she hopes someone would do for her son.
The diagnosis: 'I was really, really scared' The boy just needs a good spanking. Daniel needs a proper male role model. You're a bad mother.
Stephanie has heard it all. Her mother, three sisters and brother abandoned her when Daniel was first diagnosed. They didn't believe Stephanie. There had to be another reason for his behavior. Friends told her, please, don't talk about mental illness around the children. But word leaked out. Kids taunted Daniel.
Hey, stupid! You're mental!
Once, Daniel was beaten by an acquaintance while a friend shot video that was later posted on YouTube. It showed Daniel getting punched in the face, then falling to the ground and being kicked. Some friends shunned Daniel and his mom. The phrase "mental illness" was met with fear, disbelief, prejudice, ignorance. Stephanie herself had not understood the early signs. At age 6, Daniel complained he heard voices. She downplayed it. She told herself the walls were paper thin, that he was hearing conversations throughout the home.
Then, everything changed.
On a fishing trip one weekend in March 2009, Stephanie watched as Daniel pushed their lunch supplies, one by one, off the top of a picnic table. Chips, cups, napkins. When she scolded him, he apologized: I'm sorry. I'm just clumsy.
He kept the real reason to himself: Voices urged him to shove his 3-year-old brother into the lake so he would drown. Daniel pushed stuff off the table instead; it was his way of deflecting the voices, of keeping his brother safe. At school the following Monday, Daniel's hallucinations intensified. He stabbed himself in the head with a pencil because he was having more thoughts about hurting his brother. Finally, he confided in his teacher. Only then did his mother learn the truth.
Mom, I have been having thoughts of wanting to hurt my brother, he told her, but don't worry, I don't want to harm him. Stephanie shifted into overdrive. She stayed home to monitor Daniel's behavior. She began trying to get him admitted to a hospital for evaluation. It took five days but she succeeded. On March 25, 2009, she went with him to Southwest Mental Health Center.
"I had never seen anything like I did that night," Stephanie recalls. Daniel's mood changed every second. He was happy, sitting next to his mother. Then, suddenly, he was under a table, clinging to a leg and crying. He ran around the room, announced he could fly. Then he stopped and looked at his mother: Mom, did you know I can see through doors?
To Daniel, all of it was real.
"Patient reports he started hearing voices within the last week that he describes as multiple voices, mainly telling him to hurt his brother and specifically to stab him with a sharp object," the hospital evaluation said. "Also telling him to hurt self. Prevents acting on these commands by hurting self or doing things with other objects."
Daniel was hospitalized for two weeks. His diagnosis: type 1 bipolar disorder, compounded by episodes of psychosis. Stephanie went to Barnes & Noble and bought nearly every book they had on bipolar disorder. She learned to understand what she had witnessed. Daniel's impulsive urges, his sudden bursts of energy fit the description of mania; his extreme lows matched the depression that accompanies bipolar disorder. The voices and visions her son described met the definition for psychosis.
Stephanie also grappled with something the hospital report hinted at: Guilt that her recent divorce from Daniel's stepfather had scarred a boy who'd never known his own father.
Daniel suffered from a lack of self-esteem, and he was "likely to feel he lacks control and things happen to him," the report said. "This could be influenced by the early 'loss' of his biological father and more recently the reported relational loss with his stepfather." Stephanie renewed the pledge she'd made to her son on the day he was born. "Daniel will never know how heartbreaking it was to watch him spiral up and down in a matter of seconds," she wrote in her journal, "but he will know that no matter how hard it gets, I will always be there to pick him up."
Her son understood for the first time that he suffered from mental illness. "I can tell you how I felt," Daniel says. "I was really, really scared."
That year, Stephanie took the summer off to spend time with her boys. She bonded with them over fishing. "I was the only mom out there," she says. The other boys all had their fathers in tow. Stephanie brags: "We caught more fish than anyone else."
But by year's end, Daniel was in the hospital again. His episodes changed with every medication regimen. Drug combinations that were meant to control his state of mind seemed only to make his condition worse. The frequency of hospitalizations soon picked up. The year 2010 was marked by four, and in 2011 there were five, including a 90-day court-ordered commitment. That was one of the toughest for Stephanie. The doctor suggested that route because outpatient therapy wasn't working. Agreeing to a court commitment meant a loss of control. He'd be away for three months minimum.
In a way, she felt relief. Her son was where he needed to be, getting professional care, and she had time to breathe. She recalibrated and devised a long-term plan for Daniel. She taught a class for medical assistants at a local trade school and continued working full-time.
But she couldn't help but wonder: Am I doing the right thing?
She visited Daniel every day for the first two weeks. She fretted the staff would deem her a bad mother if she didn't show up. But the visits were awful. Daniel hurled insults at her, said he hated her. Once, he threw a chair at her during a family session. He accused her of wanting to get rid of him. Every time, she left the hospital more miserable than when she entered. "I dreaded going there instead of being happy to see him." She dubbed the stroll from the hospital to her car in the parking lot "the walk of shame."
It didn't help that her siblings weren't supporting her. They thought she exaggerated Daniel's problems. Initially, so did Jose.They met at the trade school, where Jose was teaching, too. Stephanie told him up front about her son's illness.
If you want to run, she said, go right ahead.
They've been together two years now.
When a child suffers from an "invisible" illness, Jose says, "You just have a hard time accepting that there's something wrong." "Once I understood better," he says, "that's when it got easier."
But he adds, "I don't think everyone can do it."
Jose runs his own air conditioning business and can rush home when needed. He has filled a void in Daniel's life. The first hospitalization occurred exactly one year after Daniel's stepfather left. And every year since, that anniversary has triggered an episode resulting in hospitalization.
It's taken time to build trust, but Daniel now calls Jose "Dad." Not only has Jose not turned and run, but he embraces the messy life of raising a teenager, one who happens to be mentally ill. Many people, he says, don't view those with mental illness as human; they're freaks, crazies, even monsters. Other people, Jose says, have this Hollywood vision of mental illness: It's difficult but then -- ta-da -- everything is fine. "The reality is people have to live with it for a lifetime," he says. "The illness doesn't end when the credits roll. If you don't have the resolve or the stamina to handle it, you're in a lot of trouble."
In real life, the script gets ripped up.
A suicide attempt, and understanding
On a day in late June, Uncle Joe's custom-made barbecue pit, complete with a bottle opener the shape of Texas, covers Stephanie's front lawn. Three massive smokers house a Texas-sized feast: 80 pounds of brisket, platters of sausage links, nine dozen ears of corn, and heaps of barbecued cabbage. More than 100 relatives mingle in and around Stephanie's house to celebrate the 63rd birthday of her mother, Rosa. It's as much a goodbye party as it is a birthday celebration. Rosa's cancer is progressing.

Daniel’s family attends a Catholic healing mass for his grandmother, Rosa, who is battling brain cancer.
The family lives in a modest four-bedroom ranch in a working-class neighborhood in suburban San Antonio. Stephanie's living room has four framed photographs on the wall, including one of the children with this motto:
"Family: Other things may change us, but we begin and end as a family."
Outside, the children play on an inflatable water slide. Relatives scarf up the food at tables covered with floral prints. When supper is done, everyone's attention turns to a television set on the patio. Images of a vibrant Rosa with her daughters and son flash across the screen. Rosa sits nearby but is too weak to say much. She waves to everyone and thanks them for their love.
Laughter fills the backyard. Tears roll down faces, too. Among those captivated by the display is Daniel. He almost left the family nine months earlier. That's when he tried to kill himself. He'd gotten into an argument with his mother about breaking curfew. She said he could no longer be trusted. His response: Gulping down every pill he could get his hands on.
Stephanie and Jose rushed him to the hospital. It took 10 men in the emergency room to hold Daniel down. Let me die! he screamed. The suicide attempt turned the tide for Stephanie's family.
Her mother and sisters could no longer ignore the severity of his illness. At the hospital, everyone wept except for one person: Stephanie. "I didn't want him to see me break, because if I broke down it would make his situation a lot worse."
On this night, after guests leave, Stephanie's sisters talk about their guilt for abandoning her and their ignorance of mental illness.
Lamar Enriquez is the oldest sister and knows the pain of a loved one going untreated. Her husband of 13 years shot himself in the head last year. "That's what scares me about Daniel," she cries, "because he's only 14. I wouldn't want my sister to go through what I went through."
Mari De La Cerda had an awakening after Daniel twice went into psychosis while she was babysitting. "When it happened, it was scary. Very scary, because I didn't know what was going through his mind. "I don't know how my sister handles it," she says. "But we're here for her. Now, we totally understand."
Adds Chel Ruiz, Stephanie's youngest sister: "You have to reach that point and realize and accept that he does have a problem. That's the hardest part."
The most striking story comes from a family friend. His 11-year-old son told Daniel he planned to hang himself because his mother left home. Don't do it. You've got people who love you, Daniel told him. I love you and your daddy loves you.
The father fights back tears. "I thank God for him being my son's friend," he says. "The way I look at it, Daniel is an angel."
'I see demons flying everywhere'
Above Daniel's bed hang a crucifix, a drawing of him swinging a baseball bat and a postcard from New York City. A hand-written banner for his favorite television show scrawls across the room. "The Walking Dead," it says.
Clothes overflow drawers. Five baseball mitts sit in a carton on top of books and accumulated junk. Neatness isn't Daniel's strong suit.
In that way – and others -- he's like most teens. His passions are music, dancing, basketball, video games. Martial arts is one of his favorite activities – it helps channel his thoughts in a positive fashion. He hopes to become a UFC fighter one day.
Daniel also knows he's different from most other teens -- in a big way.
"I've seen like bodies on the floor when they're not even there," he says. "If I look up in the sky and I'm outside, it's like everything's just dark, like the sky is red and I see demons flying everywhere.
"When I hear voices, it's hard to like deal with it because you're going crazy, because you don't know what to do."
His mental illness is a terrible thing, he says, not just for him but his whole family. "I hate when it happens. Like I hate it. I hate it," he says. "I don't like having a mental illness because it hurts my mom, it hurts my brother and it hurts my dad. It's just, I don't like it."
He's afraid he will have to deal with the hallucinations for the rest of his life, because "I should be growing out of it by now."
He doesn't want to harm people. He averts his anxiety by running around the neighborhood, pacing in the backyard and cutting his arm, which brings relief. He punches walls and kicks the fence out back so as not to carry out the voices' commands. Daniel dislikes going to the hospital, "but I have to get stable," he says. "It's better than hurting someone."

Daniel and his youngest brother play together in the family SUV. Daniel doesn’t like having his sibilings see his episodes. “I hate it,” he says.
Five medications attempt to regulate his mood swings, control his anxiety, tamp down the episodes of psychosis. The family takes safety precautions. Guns are no longer kept in the house. Sharp knives are out of reach. Stephanie sent her youngest son to live with his father for a year while she got Daniel treatment. Now, with four children in the home, Daniel is not left alone with the others. That requires extensive planning and coordination. Daniel's psychiatrist, Corey Hough, works with him to pinpoint what exactly causes his anxiety and triggers his episodes. "One of our big goals is to get him to identify when he's heading that direction, rather than wait until he's already there and already feeling like he wants to hurt himself," says Hough, a psychiatrist at the Clarity Child Guidance Center, the facility where Daniel has been hospitalized the most.
Daniel's suicide attempt was a cry for help, he says. "When you have individuals with bipolar and they have an elevated mood and they're manic, they're very impulsive and reckless," he says. "Something doesn't go their way, and they'll go and drink a bottle of pills. They don't really put any thought into it – and that's a very risky situation and that's something Daniel has done."
School acts as his biggest stressor. Daniel worries about fitting in. He struggles to concentrate. The start of the school year might bring anxiety to any kid, Hough says, but for Daniel it means he worries about it constantly. "It takes over a significant part of his day, just thinking about what's going to happen," Hough says.
He describes Daniel as a "very sweet kid" who is outgoing, friendly and personable. Most people with mental illness deny they have a problem. The fact Daniel not only recognizes his wild mood swings, but is also "very willing to discuss what's going on," signifies a major step toward getting better.
"To have to deal with some of the things he has to deal with – the hallucinations, the thoughts of hurting himself, the anxiety – none of those are pleasant feelings. And he's done a very good job of articulating how he's feeling and communicating to myself and his mom and to his family of what's going on."
What about his thoughts of harming siblings? Hough explains it is "more of a control thing." "Fantasizing in his head of hurting people that piss him off helps make him feel better. It's not that he wants to do it; he doesn't. It's his way of sort of coping with it and coping with the moment."
What pushes a person across that edge, to act on the voices' commands, remains the great unknown in psychiatry. "I don't have a crystal ball," Hough says. "I can't say for sure what happens when a patient leaves my office."
The protocol is to err on the side of caution. A family must take measures around the home, and the psychiatrist must recognize when hospitalization is needed. Hough remains optimistic for Daniel. If Hough can help him better identify the triggers and minimize his medication, there will be success. "I want to get him through high school," he says. "I'd like for him to go on and do what he'd like to do."
But that will take time.
'I'm going to hurt them, Mom'
Stephanie is resting in bed ahead of her overnight shift on a Friday night in August when Daniel walks in.
Two of his siblings have been teasing him. A rage is building inside, he says. Stephanie tells Daniel to take some melatonin to take the edge off his anxiety.
He leaves the room, takes the medicine but soon returns.
This time is different. A dead serious look spreads across his face, and his pupils are dilated. Stephanie has never seen her boy like this.
I'm going to hurt them, Mom, he says.
Stephanie springs from bed.
Well, baby, let's go to the hospital.
She gathers her stuff and calls the Laurel Ridge Treatment Center, the closest hospital to the family's home. Bring him as soon as possible, she's told. She hops into the family SUV. Daniel gets in the passenger seat. It's only the second time she's driven him to the hospital by herself during an episode. She keeps an eye on the road and one eye on her boy. He sits quietly in the front seat, but it's clear he's still agitated. She finally engages.
You had thoughts of hurting the kids. Do you still have those feelings?
Actually I still do, he says.
The drive becomes a blur.
Four days later, Stephanie returns to the hospital for a family session with Daniel and his counselor. But first she meets with the counselor alone. She speaks of her stress – caring for her dying mother, trying to help her son, making ends meet. The counselor reassures her that's enough pressure to make anyone implode.
"That's a lot to go through," the counselor says. "You're not getting a break at all. You're go, go, go. You have to be on 24/7. And it's like to the point of, 'Who is taking care of you?'"
Stephanie utters: "Uh-huh."
"That has to be frustrating. I know it is," the counselor says.
Stephanie bursts into tears.
The counselor stresses the positive – that Daniel is keenly aware of the things going on with him and that he seeks his mother's help when he can't handle his thoughts. Not too many children, especially those with mental illness, have that type of relationship with a parent.
"You know, if you find any encouragement in the fact you're doing a great job with Daniel, he's a great kid."
Daniel enters the room and first explains what happened with the most recent episode.
"I guess I was mad that the kids were home because of the way they treat me."
How do they treat you?
"Well, they treat me like I'm stupid and then they just do every little thing to bother me. They bring me into their arguments, when I don't want to be in their arguments."
As he speaks, Stephanie cries. "Are you OK?" he asks his mom.
"Yeah," she says.
Stephanie tells the counselor that she and Jose have spoken with the children about the need to go easy on Daniel – that normal sibling spats can easily get overblown. The family will need to address it further.
"We can try it," Daniel says, "but honestly I don't think it will work."
Mother and son then have a heart-to-heart. She begins with the news she's received while he's been in the hospital.
"First of all, you passed into the eighth grade," she says.
"Aww, I did. Yes!"
"I'm just worried about you starting a new grade," she continues, "and getting frustrated so easily with the work and it being stressful at home. So we need to figure out how you're going to be able to have a normal school life."
"I know I've said this before," Daniel says, "but I know I didn't try last year. But I'm kind of tired of that, too. Honestly, it's like since I came here, I've realized a lot of things. I've gotten mad over stupid crap. "I want it to stop."
"It only stops when it comes from you," his mother says. "You are the one that has to initiate stopping it."
"Yeah, that's what I'm going to do," Daniel says. "I'm going to try to stop, and I'm going to try to work harder, like the hardest I've ever done before, which is nothing actually."
The counselor advises him to draw up an action plan, and Daniel agrees. Stephanie bids farewell to her son.
Leaving Daniel behind in the hospital is no longer a walk of shame. It's become part of the healing process.
'He's not trying to be mean to you'
The day Daniel comes home, Stephanie and Jose call a family meeting. First they talk with Daniel at the table before calling the other three children into the room.
It's a tricky conversation. Jose and Stephanie try to shield Daniel's siblings from the severity of their brother's illness. They don't want them to know everything because then they will be afraid of him. "We have to figure out ways to discourage behavior" that sets Daniel off, Stephanie told me the day before, "without saying, 'You drive Daniel crazy.'"
Stephanie sits at the head of the table with Daniel at the far end, Jose next to him. The other three children take up their seats. Then, Jose begins.
"The certain comments you make, the certain things you say," Jose says. "You guys can't do it anymore."
They've had this conversation before and it must end now, Jose says. "When he says, 'Don't touch me,' don't touch him," Stephanie says. "When he tells you, 'Get out of my room,' you need to just get out of his room. OK?
"He's not trying to be mean to you. He's not trying to be rude. It's just sometimes he doesn't feel well. OK? It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Sometimes, he just has a bad day and he's not in the mood to be picked on."
Jose: "The thing is you take it to a point where you don't realize how upsetting that is, especially to Daniel. You may get upset, but it's not as bad as Daniel gets."
"There's a difference," Stephanie says.
Jose: "And it has to do a lot with the way Daniel thinks. You doing that to another person – it's still not right, but it has far less of an effect on that person than it does Daniel."
The three siblings remain quiet.
Earlier, Daniel told his parents the other children hate him. "That's how he feels. He really feels you guys don't like him," Stephanie says.
"We can't have that anymore," adds Jose. "Do you guys get it? Are we going to have this conversation again?'"
One of his brothers interjects. "But Daniel has told me he hated me."
"No, I haven't," snaps Daniel.
"Yes, you have."
"I'm not going to get in an argument," Daniel responds. "I'm not going to even argue."
He tosses his hands in the air and then puts them down. Daniel doesn't like having an episode in front of his siblings. He looks for ways to divert his thoughts, and it's clear he's trying to contain his agitation.
Stephanie works to calm him. "If that's the case, then I think you guys all should apologize to each other."
Daniel stands up and walks into the kitchen. "And let bygones be bygones and start fresh," Stephanie continues. Daniel heads toward the front door.
"Daniel!" Stephanie screams.
The door slams. Daniel is gone.
"You have to understand that you're not better than anybody else," Jose tells the kids. "That's the biggest thing: We always try to take very good care of you guys. Don't make anybody feel bad. Don't make anybody feel that they're not as good as you."
The meeting is already over when Daniel returns 10 minutes later. But worry will occupy Stephanie the rest of the night.
"If we're asleep and he does something, you know, that's just one of my fears," she says.
"I've never had that fear as bad as I have it now because he's getting older, bigger, stronger."
Another night, another episode
Ten minutes to go, then it's sangria and flamenco dancing.
The white Chevy Suburban eases to a halt at a stoplight. It's been a long day – a Catholic healing Mass for Stephanie's mother followed by dinner with cousins at a Mexican restaurant. Stephanie and Jose are nearing a long-awaited night on the town. School starts in two days and already stress is building in the household. "I need to get out," Stephanie said at the start of the evening.

Daniel paces the backyard during an episode of psychosis in August. His mother tries to distract him from the voices he hears. She knows if the episode isn’t brought under control within about 20 minutes, it can last hours – perhaps even days.
The couple has deposited Jose's two children with grandparents. Stephanie's other son is with his biological father. A sitter is lined up for Daniel. All they have to do is drop him off at home. The SUV lurches forward. From the back seat, Daniel calls for his mother. "I think I need my pills," he says.
Stephanie perks up. They're almost home, she says, and he can take his medicine as soon as he walks through the door. The family outing took hours longer than expected. Stephanie didn't bring his nighttime dose.
Daniel's tone turns almost shrill. "I need them now."
Jose floors it. The Suburban hurtles down the highway – 65 mph, 70, 75. The couple have been through this drill before. They know it's key to distract Daniel from the voices he hears. Jose asks him about the priest's sermon on the strength needed to reach heaven.
"How do you get there?" Stephanie asks.
"You get there ... " Daniel places his hands on his head. "I don't know."
"My stomach hurts and my head hurts," he says. "I'm dizzy and everything's blurry."
"You've been in the car a little too long," Stephanie says.
"We're almost home," Jose says. "My head hurts, too. Less than 10 minutes away."
Stephanie: "What are you hearing?" "Just some weird voice," Daniel says. "It just sounds weird. It doesn't sound like what I used to hear. It's just really, really different."
"Just remember who is in control, right?" Stephanie says.
"Yeah, I know, but it's just like I've never heard this before," Daniel says, his voice rising. "It's creepy. It's different. I can't get it out of my head. The VOICE!"
Jose whips in and out of traffic. He glances from the road to the rearview mirror. Daniel grimaces and begins talking in a strained tone. The demons are showing him something. "It's a picture of an arm with cuts on it."
"Just take a deep breath," Stephanie says. "Just remember, you're the one in control."
The boy moans. "Are you all right?" Stephanie says.
"I don't know," Daniel whines.

"We've gone through too many of these things," Stephanie says, "and every time you're all right. Right?"
"Yeah," he says.
Silence consumes the vehicle for 20 seconds. Then, Daniel screams. "I'm seeing things." His voice is hesitant, almost hushed with worry.
"OK," his mom says. "What are you seeing?"
"I looked out the window, and I saw a face pop up."
Daniel curls into a fetal ball.
Moments later, Jose cuts the SUV down a side street, hooks a left and pulls up to the house. The truck comes to a halt in the family's front yard. The three jump out as if the vehicle is on fire. They have about 20 minutes to calm him, or the episode will last a couple of hours, perhaps even days.
Stephanie ushers Daniel through the front door, into the living room, and onto the patio. Daniel sits in a rocking chair. He sways back and forth, his legs and arms fidgety. "There's things all around," he says.
Stephanie tries to soothe him, gives him his medication. "What do you think triggered it?"
"I don't know," he says.
"Do you want to walk around for a little bit?"
He rushes from the chair and paces in the backyard. "I'm just trying to make it go away," he says. "It's weird. It's like a conversation's going on."
He plops down at a picnic table. A neighbor's dog barks from behind a wooden fence. Daniel douses his head with a bottle of water. Stephanie and Jose ask him about a summer reading book, "Moby Dick," to get him to think about something else – anything else.
"What do you remember?" Stephanie says.
"What they have is an old man who wanted revenge," Daniel says. "All he had was hate."
"OK," Jose says.
"Who'd he have hate towards?" Stephanie asks.
"Moby Dick, just because he took his leg off."
"Who's Moby Dick?" Stephanie says.
"The whale."
It's a little past 10 p.m., and the temperature hangs in the 90s, the Texas heat adding to the intensity of the moment. A few minutes pass, the medication kicks in and Daniel's mood eases. He heads inside to bed.
Stephanie and Jose sigh. They've conquered this episode just in time, right around the 20-minute mark. But they're exhausted, exasperated. Stephanie's word is traumatized.
"It takes a lot out of you," Jose says.
Stephanie: "Yeah."
Jose: "Even when it's simple like that."
Just as Ahab's quest for the great white whale seemed futile at times, so does the family's quest for normalcy. There will be no sangria or flamenco dancing tonight.
Epilogue
Daniel began eighth grade two days later, on Monday, August 26. By the end of that week, anxiety overwhelmed him. He went back into the hospital for a six-day stay.
But Daniel didn't give up on school. He returned to class.
Good news came with Daniel's midterm report card in October. He received passing grades in all but one subject for the first time since fourth grade. The marks reflect Daniel's resolve, and that buoys his mother. The report card, Stephanie says, is a "huge accomplishment in our own mental health world."
About this story
Stephanie Escamilla agreed to let CNN into her home to document what it is like to raise a child with a serious mental illness. Her 14-year-old son, whose real name is not used in the story and whose face is obscured in the video and photographs, also agreed to participate. In June 2013, reporter Wayne Drash made the first of many visits to their home in San Antonio, Texas. Video producer Evelio Contreras also spent weeks with the family.
The dialogue and direct quotes in the story were heard by Drash or drawn from documents, videos or audio recordings. Italics are used in the instances where the dialogue was recalled by a participant and not witnessed by the reporter.
