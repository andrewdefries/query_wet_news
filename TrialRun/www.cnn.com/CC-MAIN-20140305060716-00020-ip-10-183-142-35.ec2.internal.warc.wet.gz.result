Experts: Many young Muslim terrorists spurred by humiliationStory Highlights Most assumptions about young Muslim terrorists are wrong, experts say They say those that turn to violence are shaped by several common factors Terror expert: 'They are not crazy people' Next Article in World » Read VIDEO By John Blake CNN	CNN -- At first, no one seemed to notice the young man who walked into the hotel lobby at around 7:45 that Friday morning. Boys (whose faces are blurred out in this photo) attend a "summer camp" sponsored by Hamas. He wore a baseball cap, a backpack and dragged a wheeled suitcase behind him. He casually checked his watch as he calmly walked toward a hotel restaurant filled with Western business executives. A hotel security camera caught what happened next. In a matter of moments, the lobby was engulfed in billowing white smoke and flying debris. Another suspected suicide bomber had left his bloody mark. The bombing at the JW Marriott Hotel and the adjacent Ritz-Carlton in Jakarta, Indonesia, on July 17 killed nine people, including the presumed bombers. Investigators are looking at a link between the attacks and a Muslim terrorist group fighting a "holy war" against the West. Terrorism is not confined to any faith or any culture. Terrorists are driven by varying impulses. Yet since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America, terrorism has often been associated with young Muslim men. Watch as CNN's Christiane Amanpour investigates how one madrassa student is recruited to join the Taliban » People often assume that Muslim youth who turn to violence are ill-educated fanatics inspired by visions of meeting virgins in paradise. But that portrait is rarely true, terror experts say. "They are not crazy people," says James Jones, author of "Blood That Cries Out From the Earth," a book that examines the psychology of religious terrorism. "They [terrorist groups] won't recruit psychotic people," Jones says. "Crazy people are unstable. That's exactly what you don't want." Then who are these Muslim men and women who turn to violence? Terror experts say they are shaped by several common factors. They see no way up or out Fathali M. Moghaddam, director of the conflict resolution program at Georgetown University in Washington, says some Muslim youth may embrace violent causes because they believe they have no chance for upward mobility in their country. "Imagine if you're a 20-year-old and you want to get on in Egypt or Saudi Arabia," Moghaddam says. "You better be connected by family or know somebody important."

Many don't view politics as a plausible vehicle for social change, Moghaddam says. Their countries are often run by dictators who crush secular opposition groups -- with the tacit support of the U .S. government, these youth believe, Moghaddam says. The only opposition groups that these Middle East dictators dare not attack are those based in the mosque, Moghaddam says. Those mosque-based groups, though, tend to be open to the influence of fundamentalists. "There's no opportunity for voice, no opportunity to express yourself," Moghaddam says. "Politics is out of the question for the secular opposition -- you're either dead or go to jail." Politics, though, is part of the answer for Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist group that rules Gaza. The group, which has admitted responsibility for attacks against Israel soldiers and civilians, won a landslide victory in the 2006 Palestinian legislative election. Watch a young man who chooses to join the Hamas militia » "Some young people are inevitably attracted to the more risky positions and actions taken by a group such as Hamas because Hamas is critical of corrupt and inept dictators in the Arab world," Moghaddam says. "This resonates with Arab youth." They're driven by a sense of humiliation Some Muslim youth may turn to violence for another reason: revenge. Basel Saleh, an assistant economics professor at Radford University in Virginia, recently studied the socioeconomic factors that helped shape 82 Palestinian suicide bombers and 240 militants. He says he knows those factors firsthand. Saleh's father's village was razed by the Israelis in 1948 and is now an Israeli settlement. He says he grew up in the West Bank where he once considered using violence to vent his anger after a group of Israeli soldiers came to his family's home unannounced and interrogated him while his younger sister cried. "But I was on the verge of getting there," he says. "I almost crossed that line." Most Palestinian youth who did cross that line weren't driven by religion, Saleh says. "Many weren't motivated by Islamic fundamentalism," Saleh says of the Palestinian militants in his study. "They were motivated primarily by personal grievances. They had been arrested, shot or seen family arrested." Saleh says some Palestinian youth who believe Israeli soldiers have mistreated their family members may feel duty-bound to retaliate with violence. Protecting one's family against humiliation is important in Middle Eastern culture, he says. "If anything is done to your family, it's personal," Saleh says. "It has to do with the honor of the family. Family is everything in the Middle East. Your honor is defined by your family." Saleh says if Israel did more to help improve Palestinians' living conditions, fewer Palestinian youths would turn to violence. "You have to open a new path for them [Palestinians]," he says. "They want freedom of movement. Give them an airport, a port. Don't demolish their schools and their universities. Pay attention to basic human rights." The anger felt by some Palestinian youth is also stoked by propaganda, says Michael Jacobson, a senior fellow in The Washington Institute's Stein Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence. Hamas sponsors children television shows and summer camps that are designed to indoctrinate Palestinian children with the same message, Jacobson says. Watch Amanpour go inside a Hamas boys summer camp » "From an early age, they're taught that fighting the jihad against Israel and being a martyr are great things to be," says Jacobson, author of "The West at War: U.S. and European Counterterrorism Efforts Post-September 11." Other extremist groups use another medium, the Internet, to radicalize Muslim youth, says Jones, author of "Blood That Cries Out From the Earth." Muslim youth who spend time on the Internet are exposed to sophisticated videos from terrorist groups showing Muslims being killed in places such as the West Bank, Iraq and Chechnya, Jones says. The sophisticated videos tell the life stories of young Muslims who have volunteered to be martyrs, Jones says. "There's this constant message that Islam is under attack," Jones says. "Your brothers and sisters are being killed. It's your duty to do something for them." They're driven by a need to join a cause Jones says the appeal of terrorist groups taps into an even deeper yearning in many youth, no matter their religion or culture: the desire to give one's self to a transcendent cause. Jones, who joined civil rights demonstrations in the South during the 1960s, says he knows how exhilarating it can be for young people to join a cause that they believe demands some form of sacrifice. Any effort to turn Muslim youth away from violent groups must make a similar appeal, and come from fellow Muslims, Jones says. "We need something that has an equal amount of passion and moral seriousness that makes them believe they are making the world better," he says. "We need something with those elements but something that's more constructive than blowing yourself up."

Mexico City woos same-sex honeymoonersBy Catherine E. Shoichet, CNN Mexico City officials cut a rainbow ribbon to open the city's new gay tourism office. STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe first couple to wed under Argentina's new same-sex marriage law arrives this weekA new government tourism office in Mexico City aims to attract more gay visitorsOfficials hope the city will become the top destination for gay travelers in Latin AmericaProfessor: Latin America has some of the most gay-friendly cities in the developing world

Argentina
Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- As more governments approve same-sex marriage laws, officials here are hoping to attract a growing part of the tourism market: gay honeymoons. The first couple to wed under Argentina's recent law allowing same-sex marriages nationwide arrives in Mexico this week on an all-expenses-paid trip -- part of a new push by the government in Mexico City, Mexico to woo gay travelers. "We hope that many same-sex couples who get married around the world spend their honeymoons here," says Alejandro Rojas, the city's tourism secretary. In July, the city opened an office aimed at catering to gay tourists that officials describe as the first of its kind in Latin America. "We are a very tolerant, liberal, avant-garde city," Rojas says. Officials inaugurated the new office by cutting a rainbow-colored ribbon. Rojas said the office's goal is to make Mexico City the No. 1 gay-friendly destination in Latin America. "Mexico has a tradition of being a rather macho culture... This is a sign of a very important social change," says Argentinean architect Jose Luis David Navarro, who will be spending part of his honeymoon in Mexico City this week. The city's tourism secretary called to congratulate Navarro and his husband soon after they wed in northern Argentina in July. For years, it was rare to see gay rights issues gaining traction in Mexico and other Latin American countries. Not anymore, according to Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts. "Latin America currently has some of the most gay-friendly cities in the developing world," says Corrales, who ranks cities' gay-friendliness in a new book he co-edited, "The Politics of Sexuality in Latin America." Homosexuality remains a divisive issue in much of Mexico, with conservative politicians pushing for laws banning same-sex marriage in many states after Mexico City approved a gay marriage law last year. The country's Roman Catholic Church leaders have been vocal opponents of the Mexico City law, which took effect in March and also allows married gay couples to adopt children. But Mexico City officials say they hope to set a strong example that the rest of the country will follow. Project plans for the new gay tourism office are still in the works. In addition to training local hotels and restaurants on how to be sensitive to gay clientele, officials say they hope to create maps of the city highlighting attractions for gay tourists and possibly host an international gay tourism conference. Hotels, restaurants and businesses in Mexico City have responded positively to the program so far, Rojas said. So many sponsors offered to chip in for the Argentinean couple's free honeymoon that the city government didn't have to contribute any funds. The annual economic impact of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender travelers is about $63 billion in the U.S. alone, according to Community Marketing, Inc. of San Francisco, California. On the global scale, Rojas says, that number is even greater. "Around the world, it is a very important market," Rojas says. Gay tourists represent 15 percent of the world's tourism market, and they spend more money than heterosexual tourists when they travel, he says. Recognizing the commercial value of gay tourism is a positive step, Navarro says, but it also shows that more social change is needed. "I hope that there comes a day in the future when they don't have to have an office for gay tourists, just like there isn't an office for Asian tourists," Navarro says. But for now, he says, he and his husband are looking forward to the chance to visit Mexico City for the first time. "Our suitcase is already packed," he says. "After 27 years of happiness together, this is the icing on the cake."

Supreme Court decision on polarizing health care law looms
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 9:53 PM EDT, Wed June 27, 2012
Supporters of the health care legislation celebrate after the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in a 5-4 ruling Thursday, June 28. Journalists and supporters and protesters of the health care law gather outside the Supreme Court after the justices ruled in favor of its constitutionality in a narrow decision.
Protesters against the health care law rally outside the Supreme Court before the justices issue their ruling Thursday.
Reporters and camera crews begin waiting early Thursday outside the Supreme Court in anticipation of the court's health care ruling.
President Barack Obama signs the health care legislation in a March 23, 2010, ceremony with Democrats in the White House East Room. The law, which critics dubbed Obamacare, is Obama's signature legislation.
The constitutionality of the 2,409-page act was challenged by 26 states. The most controversial aspect of the law -- the "individual mandate" -- would require individuals not covered by insurance via their employer or the government to purchase and maintain minimal health insurance or pay a penalty.
The Supreme Court held three days of politically charged hearings in March on the Affordable Care Act. Opponents of Obama's health care legislation protest in front of the Supreme Court on March 28. Critics argued the law's requirement that most Americans have health insurance or pay a fine was an unconstitutional intrusion on individual freedom.
Advocates for universal, government-financed health care carry signs one month before the health care overhaul was signed into law.
Two years after Obama signed the health care legislation, the Supreme Court took up the historic test of whether it's constitutional.
The Rev. Patrick Mahoney leads demonstrators in prayer outside the Supreme Court on Monday, June 25, as they await the court's ruling. The high court upheld the law's central provision -- a requirement that all people have health insurance. The decision will have an immediate and long-term impact on all Americans, both in how they get medicine and health care.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The Supreme Court decision on health care will come Thursday
The Affordable Care Act was passed in March 2010 along partisan lines
The law requires individuals to buy health insurance or face a fine
Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court will rule Thursday on the constitutionality of the sweeping health care law championed by President Barack Obama, in a hotly awaited decision that is bound to divide the country.
The stakes cannot be overstated: what the justices decide will have an immediate and long-term impact on all Americans, both in how they get medicine and health care, and also in vast, yet unknown areas of "commerce."
Five scenarios: Health care options before the justices
According to a poll released Tuesday, 37% of Americans say they would be pleased if the health care law is deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
Twenty-eight percent would be pleased if the Affordable Care Act is ruled constitutional, the NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey showed, compared to 35% who said they would be disappointed if the court came back with that outcome.
But nearly four in 10 Americans surveyed said they would have "mixed feelings" if the justices struck down the whole law. The survey of 1,000 adults was conducted June 20-24.

How SCOTUS rulings could shape 2012 race
Bachmann: Obama not talking health care
Previous surveys have indicated that some who oppose the law do so because they think it doesn't go far enough.
The polarizing law, dubbed "Obamacare" by many, is the signature legislation of Obama's time in office.
Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told supporters in Virginia on Tuesday: "If Obamacare is not deemed constitutional, then the first three and a half years of this president's term will have been wasted on something that has not helped the American people."
Romney, whose opposition to the law has been a rallying cry on the stump, continued: "If it is deemed to stand, then I'll tell you one thing. Then we'll have to have a president -- and I'm that one -- that's gonna get rid of Obamacare. We're gonna stop it on day one."
Speaking to supporters in Atlanta Tuesday, Obama defended his health care law as the way forward for the American people.
Opinion: Aging boomers need health care law
"They understand we don't need to re-fight this battle over health care," he said. "It's the right thing to do that we've got 3 million young people who are on their parent's health insurance plans that didn't have it before. It's the right thing to do to give seniors discounts on their prescription drugs. It's the right thing to do to give 30 million Americans health insurance that didn't have it before."
White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that the administration is "confident that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional, in keeping with decades of precedent under the Commerce Clause. We continue to implement the law accordingly, and we are ready for the Supreme Court's decision, whatever it may be."
In its ruling Thursday, the nation's highest court could rule the whole law constitutional or unconstitutional, or strike down certain portions of the law while letting other provisions stand.
The Supreme Court heard three days of politically charged hearings in March on the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a landmark but controversial measure passed by congressional Democrats despite pitched Republican opposition.
The challenge focused primarily on the law's requirement that most Americans buy health insurance or pay a fine.
Supporters of the plan argued the "individual mandate" is necessary for the system to work, while critics argued it is an unconstitutional intrusion on individual freedom.
All sides preparing for political fallout from health care decision
Four different federal appeals courts heard challenges to parts of the law before the Supreme Court ruling, and came up with three different results.
Courts in Cincinnati and Washington voted to uphold the law, while the appeals court in Atlanta struck down the individual mandate.
A fourth panel, in Richmond, Virginia, put its decision off until penalties for failing to buy health insurance take effect in 2014.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed Congress along strictly partisan lines in March 2010, after a lengthy and heated debate marked by intense opposition from the health insurance industry and conservative groups.
When Obama signed the legislation later that month, he called it historic and said it marked a "new season in America."
While it was not the comprehensive national health care system liberals initially sought, supporters said the law would reduce health care costs, expand coverage and protect consumers.
Health care's big four issues: What the justices are tackling
The law establishes a staged series of reforms over several years, including banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, forbidding insurers from setting a dollar limit on health coverage payouts, and requiring them to cover preventative care at no additional cost to consumers.
It also required individuals to have health insurance, either through their employers or a state-sponsored exchange, or face a fine beginning in 2014.
Supporters argue the individual mandate is critical to the success of the legislation, because it expands the pool of people paying for insurance and ensures that healthy people do not opt out of buying insurance until they needed it.
Critics say the provision gives the government too much power over what they say should be a personal economic decision.
Twenty-six states, led by Florida, say individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a "product" they may neither want nor need. And they argue that if that provision is unconstitutional, the entire law must go.
The Justice Department countered that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not "choose" whether to participate in the health care market.
Congress ready for high court's health care decisions -- then it gets tricky
The partisan debate around such a sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed almost every traditional hot-button topic: abortion and contraception funding, state and individual rights, federal deficits, end-of-life care, and the overall economy.
During arguments on March 27, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the law appeared to "change the relationship between the government and the individual in a profound way."
Chief Justice John Roberts argued that "all bets are off" when it comes to federal government authority if Congress was found to have the authority to regulate health care in the name of commerce.
Liberal justices, however, argued people who don't pay into the health system by purchasing insurance make care more expensive for everyone.
Timeline of the health care law
"It is not your free choice" to stay out of the market for life, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said during arguments.
"I think the justices probably came into the argument with their minds made up. They had hundreds of briefs and months to study them," said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a prominent Washington attorney, though he conceded that "the oral arguments (in March) might have changed their minds around the margin."
The law, which helped spur the creation of the conservative tea party movement, is likely to be a centerpiece of the presidential election campaign.
The legislation signed by Obama reached 2,700 pages, nine major sections and some 450 provisions.
The first lawsuits challenging the health care overhaul began just hours after the president signed the measure.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Carl Pettersson of Sweden sets early pace at PGA Champinship with six-under 66
2011 U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy in group on five under
Tiger Woods in contention after three-under opener at Kiawah Island Defending champion Keegan Bradley well placed after 68
(CNN) -- Carl Pettersson of Sweden set the early pace in the PGA Championship at Kiawah Island but a gaggle of golf's elite were firmly in contention after the opening round of the final major of the season.
Pettersson carded six birdies in a flawless six-under 66 in South Carolina but 2011 U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland was only one back -- tied with Gary Woodland and Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano of Spain.
Defending champion Keegan Bradley -- a winner last week on the PGA Tour -- was in a group at four under, including veteran John Daly, while Tiger Woods carded six birdies on the way to a three-under 69.
"Anything in the 60s is going to be a good start in a major championship. I'm right there," Woods told gathered reporters.
"The wind kicked up a little bit and it changed things quite a bit and it's actually changed direction too," he added.
Latest leaderboard from PGA Championship
McIlroy has failed to mount a lasting challenge in the majors since his remarkable win at Congressional last June, but was also happy with his efforts after not dropping a shot on the Ocean Course.
"It is a great way to start a tournament," he told gathered reporters. "I thought I had to take advantage of the conditions. I am very happy."
Unheralded Dutchman Joost Luiten had looked set to lead the way as he reached eight under, but finishing at the ninth, he spoiled his round with a run of four straight bogeys to close with a 68.
Australia's Adam Scott -- a man who knows all about dropping four shots at the end of a round -- also opened with a 68, while Open champion Ernie Els compiled a steady par round of 72.
The 34-year-old Petterson, who is based in the United States, took dual citizenship earlier this year and in April achieved his fifth victory on the PGA Tour when he won the Heritage tournament.
Like the other leaders, he took advantage of drying conditions on a course hit by thunderstorms earlier this week.
World number one Luke Donald of England failed to capitalize as he struggled to a two-over par 74, one better than compatriot Lee Westwood who finished with a disappointing 75.

Tunisian artist graffitis minaret, fights intolerance By Catriona Davies, CNN
updated 1:38 PM EDT, Thu September 20, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
eL Seed painted tallest minaret in Tunisia with passage from Quran that tackles intolerance
Artist's work combines Arabic calligraphy and street art to form his distinctive "calligraffiti"
Says he was reacting to clashes between hardline Islamist Salafists and artists
Street art has boomed in Tunisia since the revolution, says eL Seed
(CNN) -- Fine Arabic calligraphy and street art may seem worlds apart, but for artist eL Seed, they're one and the same thing.
eL Seed, a 31-year-old French Tunisian artist, has just used his distinctive style of Arabic street art, which he calls "calligraffiti," to decorate the tallest minaret in Tunisia with a verse from the Quran that tackles intolerance.
The mural, on the Jara Mosque in eL Seed's hometown of Gabes is 47 meters tall, 10 meters wide and covers two sides of the minaret, his biggest artwork to date.
eL Seed said he was reacting to clashes between hardline Islamist Salafists and artists at an art fair in Tunis in June that showed works the Salafists believed was insulting to Islam.
Tunisia has experienced the resurgence of ultra-conservative Islamist groups since since the revolution that ousted president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.

eL Seed said he believed both the artists and the religious extremists were showing intolerance and he wanted to bring a message of tolerance.
"My goal was to bring people together, which is why I chose these words from the Quran," said eL Seed. "I like graffiti because it brings art to everyone. I like the fact of democratizing art.
"I hope it will inspire other people to do crazy projects and not to be scared."
I hope it will inspire other people to do crazy projects and not to be scared.eL Seed
eL Seed, who was born and raised in France by a Tunisian family, grew up speaking Tunisian dialect. He did not learn to read or write Arabic until his late teens and discovered a renewed interest in his Tunisian roots.
He began experimenting with street art both in France and Tunisia at the age of 16, and gradually increased the scale of his work. He said street art has boomed in Tunisia since the revolution.
"Street art is not new to Tunisia, but it was much more small scale before the revolution," he said. "I would do a wall in a community and people in the neighborhood would come along and help me.
"In the beginning I would work when no-one was around, but as I got more well-known, people would invite me to decorate their walls."

After the revolution in January 2011, street art was possible on a bigger scale, he said.
"Before the revolution art in Tunisia was quite bourgeois, but if you put big pieces of art on walls it is for everyone," said eL Seed, now living in Montreal, Canada.
"The revolution pushed people to be more creative because before they were scared -- and now they have more freedom."
Exactly a year after the start of the protests against President Ben Ali which sparked uprisings across the Arab world, eL Seed took on his first large-scale mural to celebrate Tunisia's revolution.

In the city of Kairouani, he painted a giant mural with a passage from a Tunisian poem he intended as a message of hope to all those engaged in struggles against tyranny, corruption, and injustice.
The wall he used had been used during the revolution to voice dissent during the revolution, he said, adding that six others spontaneously joined him to help with the mural.
Before the revolution art in Tunisia was quite bourgeois, but if you put big pieces of art on walls it is for everyone.eL Seed
eL Seed wrote on his website: "The wall on which we painted had actually been used to voice dissent and commentary throughout the protests. Folks painted freely on this wall and would discuss current opinions and the changing state of Tunisia.
"This wall, however, was painted over not long after the ousting of Ben Ali: Those revolutionary words no longer able to conjure the memories of defiance and dignity. In this sense, the mural creation became a public memorial commemorating these words and their meaning."
Also on Inside the Middle East: W hat happened to Tel Aviv's tent city?
For his recent projects, eL Seed worked with a community organization Al Khaldounia, which obtained authorization for his murals. He was sponsored to do the minaret mural by Barjeel Art Foundation in the United Arab Emirates.
In his earlier works, he simply asked people if he could paint on their walls.
eL Seed chose his nickname as a tag for his grafitti at the age of 16 while studying a French novel "Le Cid."
"My teacher said 'le cid' comes from the Arabic word 'el sayed' which means 'the master, the man'. So I was 16 years old and I said to myself ' I am the master, the man' so I called myself 'eL Seed.'"
eL Seed has a solo exhibition opening at Gallery Itinerrance in Paris 13 on October 12.

Bafana Bafana tops group from Cape Verde in Group A
(CNN) -- Its coach, Lucio Antunes, is an air-traffic controller, but not even he would have predicted that the tiny island of Cape Verde would soar into the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations Sunday.
The smallest ever nation to score and win at the tournament, Cape Verde defeated Angola 2-1 in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.
There are 10 islands -- with a population of just half a million -- which make up Cape Verde's archipelago.
But in its first ever appearance at the finals, where most were expecting it to fail, the 'Blue Sharks' have captured the imagination of the watching world with its fairytale story.

Jerome Valcke: Match-fixing a 'disease'
Footballing maverick on giving back
Antunes, whose side defeated the might of Cameroon in the qualifying playoff, had drawn with host South Africa and Morocco in its previous two group games.
And despite trailing 1-0 through an own-goal, the 'Blue Sharks' hit back with two strikes in the final nine minutes to see off Angola.
"My team and I dedicate this victory to the wonderful people of the Cape Verde Islands," he told reporters.
"Our objective at this tournament has been achieved. We wanted to reach the quarterfinals."
After earning independence from Portugal in 1975, Cape Verde had to wait 17 years before being able to play a competitive match.
But Antunes, who revealed before the tournament in an interview with CNN's Human to Hero series that he had received advice from Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho, has created a team which is keen to make up for lost time.
And it showed all its fighting qualities after falling behind in the 33rd minute when skipper Neves put the ball into his own goal.
That setback appeared to rouse Antunes' side and after Gege had headed home an 81st minute equalizer, Heldon popped up at the death to fire home a dramatic winner.
Africa Cup of Nations 2013: The teams
Cape Verde progresses to the last eight along with host nation South Africa, which claimed a 2-2 draw against Morocco in an entertaining game in Durban.
Issam El Adoua and Abdelilah Hafidi put the Atlas Lions ahead only for May Mahlangu and Siyabonga Sangweni to level and condemn Morocco to a fourth consecutive first round exit.
It means the host, which has only won a single game in the past nine years at the tournament, finishes top of Group A, much to the delight of coach Gordon Igesund.
South Africa finally up and running
He told reporters: "We feel very, very proud to have achieved our first objective. I must thank the players and the fans.
"Morocco was a very tough team. I do not want to point out mistakes, but we conceded two goals we should not have done. There are now two games to the final and I believe in my players."
Rival coach Rachid Taoussi said: "I am very disappointed with the result, but we fought with dignity and honor. I am satisfied. We did not lose a game and the tournament was a positive one for me."

Police: In Florida girl's slaying, generous offer led to deadly crime
By Catherine E. Shoichet and Alina Machado, CNN
updated 9:54 AM EDT, Tue June 25, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Donald James Smith has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping and murder charges
Smith had promised to buy the girl's family clothes and hamburgers, a sheriff's official says
Cherish Lilly Perrywinkle's mother reported that she was missing from a Walmart
(CNN) -- The night that ended with Cherish Perrywinkle's disappearance started with a generous offer at the dollar store.
Investigators said a man met the 8-year-old's mother at a Dollar General in Jacksonville, Florida, Friday evening. He told her that the family looked like they were down on their luck and that he wanted to take them to Walmart and buy them new clothes.
Hours later, the mom called 911. Her daughter was missing.
The mother and her three children had spent hours shopping at Walmart with the man when he offered to buy hamburgers at the store's McDonald's, according to Michael Williams, director of investigations and homeland security for the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.
The man set off toward the front of the store with Cherish.
That, Williams told reporters, is when something went horribly wrong.
Suspect Donald James Smith has "a very extensive criminal history" that includes a kidnapping conviction.
"They walked to the front of the Walmart toward the McDonald's. They did not stop at the McDonald's," he said. "They walked outside, got in his van and left."
On Saturday morning, investigators found Cherish's lifeless body in a wooded area near a church 4 miles away.
Authorities accuse the man who offered to buy her family clothes at Walmart, Donald James Smith, with kidnapping and killing her.
He was arrested Saturday morning after an officer spotted his van driving on a local highway.
Suspect appears in court
Smith, 56, pleaded not guilty when he appeared in court on Sunday, CNN affiliate WAWS reported. He is being held without bond. It was not immediately clear whether Smith has a lawyer.
Smith is a registered sex offender who was released from custody less than a month ago, Williams said. Authorities from the sheriff's office had just made contact with him to verify his address on Friday morning.
According to the Florida Department of Corrections, Smith has a lengthy criminal record that includes crimes involving children. He was most recently convicted of impersonating a public employee and aggravated child abuse by willful torture.
Court records show he was sentenced to a year in the county jail and was released on May 31.
Investigators have not released information about how Cherish died or what they believe Smith was doing from the point of the abduction until his arrest.
Her mother, Rayne Perrywinkle, hasn't spoken publicly about what happened Friday night, and she declined to discuss the case with WAWS on Sunday.
Cherish's father, Billy James Jarreau, issued a statement Saturday through his attorney thanking law enforcement for their investigation and the public for their condolences.
"Mr. Jarreau hopes that his daughter's death sheds light on the dangers of allowing dangerous pedophiles to remain in our community," said the statement from attorney Gerald Wilkerson.
Williams told reporters that investigators had used all the resources they could to find the child. He said the tragic case offered a sobering reminder.
"Pay attention to your surroundings," he said. "Pay attention to who you meet, who you give access to your children."
A devastated community
A makeshift memorial of flowers, balloons, cards and stuffed animals has piled up in front of the church near the area where Cherish was found over the weekend, WAWS reported.
Devastated friends left hand-written notes.
Kendall Cabanda, an elementary school classmate, cried as she told WAWS about how much fun she had riding the bus with Cherish.
"We talked about stuff like TV shows, like girly things about dolls and fairies," Cabanda said, "about stuff that is imaginary."
On Sunday, hundreds attended a candlelight vigil to honor Cherish, whom friends described as a vibrant girl who liked to play dress up and loved to sing.
At the vigil, her 5-year-old sister sang "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" for her.

Ex-cops acquitted in beating death of homeless man in California
By Chuck Conder, CNN
updated 8:48 AM EST, Tue January 14, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The victim's mother says the officers got away with murder
The verdict was read in a Santa Ana, California, courtroom Monday afternoon
Eight women and four men began deliberating the case last Thursday
The beating was recorded by security cameras on the night of July 5, 2011
Los Angeles (CNN) -- A jury has acquitted two former Fullerton, California, police officers on trial in the beating death of Kelly Thomas, a mentally ill and homeless man.
The verdict was read in a Santa Ana courtroom Monday afternoon. Eight women and four men began deliberating the case on Thursday.
"I'm just horrified. They got away with murdering my son," Cathy Thomas, the victim's mother, told reporters after the verdict was read.
The victim's father, Ron Thomas, said that everyone now needs to be afraid.
"This is carte blanche to police officers to do whatever they want," he told reporters.
The beating of Thomas in a transit parking lot was recorded by security cameras on the night of July 5, 2011. The surveillance camera footage shows Thomas being beaten, clubbed and stunned with a Taser by police. The video sparked a nationwide outcry.
Former officer Manuel Ramos was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. A second former Fullerton officer, Jay Cicinelli, was charged with involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force.
Manuel Ramos, right, and Jay Patrick Cicinelli appear at their arraignment in September.
Both were found not guilty on all charges.
"These peace officers were doing their job. They had no malice in their heart," said John Barnett, an attorney for Ramos.
When asked about the video, he said it's "not the entire case."
In closing arguments, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told jurors that Ramos bore responsibility for Thomas's death because he issued a threat to the uncooperative homeless man. Ramos can be seen on the surveillance video putting on gloves and shaking his fist in Thomas' face.
