Craigslist diamond ad leads to deadly home invasion, police sayBy Gabriel Falcon, AC360 Writer James Sanders was shot and killed in a home invasion after he and his wife placed an ad in Craigslist. STORY HIGHLIGHTSFour suspects are charged with first-degree murder in death of James SandersSanders placed ad on Craigslist, arranged meeting for sale April 28He was shot three times while trying to defend son, 14Three suspects arrested after car stop; fourth surrenders Thursday (CNN) -- Four suspects have been charged with first-degree murder in connection with a home invasion that began with an ad on Craigslist, Washington state authorities said Friday. Three of the suspects were arrested on May 1. A fourth suspect, Clabon Terrel Berniard, 23, turned himself in Thursday, police said. Berniard and the others are accused of killing a man on April 28 in Edgewood, a city outside Tacoma. They are charged with first-degree murder, robbery and assault. The case began when James Sanders and his wife posted an ad on Craigslist offering a diamond ring for $1,050, said Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist. Sanders arranged to meet prospective buyers of the ring at the family's home, the prosecutor said. "Two people show up and act like a couple looking for a ring for the mother-in-law," Lindquist said. But once they entered the house, he said, the man posing as the husband pulled out a handgun. The victim, his wife, and their sons, ages 14 and 10, were restrained with plastic handcuffs, Lindquist said. Two other suspects then entered the home. One pistol-whipped the older son, he said. Sanders broke out of his restraints and attempted to defend the 14-year-old, and was shot three times, the prosecutor said. "While this is going on," Lindquist said, "other bad guys are kicking Mom in the head while she's lying on the floor." This is a cautionary tale.--Mark Lindquist, Pierce County prosecutor

The three suspects arrested in May were caught in California after a traffic stop. They have been identified as Kiyoshi A. Higashi, 22, of Tacoma; Joshua N. Reese, 20, also from Tacoma; and Amanda C. Knight, 21, from Sumner. Knight posted bail in California and subsequently surrendered to authorities in Sumner on Tuesday, authorities said. She pleaded not guilty at her arraignment. Her bail was set at $2 million. Higashi, Reese and Berniard are expected to be arraigned next week. The killing came a year after a medical student in Boston, Massachusetts, was charged with killing a woman who advertised a massage service on Craigslist. "You hate to tell people to be wary of your fellow citizens, but the reality is you've got to be wary when you are doing something when interacting with strangers on Craigslist," prosecutor Lindquist said. "This is a cautionary tale."

Bin Laden's final days -- big plans, deep fears
By Peter Bergen, CNN National Security Analyst
updated 3:05 PM EDT, Mon March 19, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Peter Bergen: Osama bin Laden's final writings show al Qaeda felt under siege
He says the al Qaeda leader was still determined to strike at the U.S.
Bergen says bin Laden urged assassination attempts against U.S. officials
He says bin Laden's writings showed his final days were filled with paranoia
Editor's note: Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, is a director at the New America Foundation. His book "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for Bin Laden; From 9/11 to Abbottabad" will be published on May 1.
Washington (CNN) -- Tapping away at his computer in the study of the suburban compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that he called home for the last years of his life, Osama bin Laden wrote memos urging his followers to continue to try to attack the United States, suggesting, for instance, they mount assassination attempts against President Obama and Gen. David Petraeus.
While he urged his organization on to attack America, bin Laden was also keenly aware that al Qaeda was in deep trouble because of the campaign of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and also because the brutal tactics of his followers had alienated many Muslims.
According to senior Obama administration officials who have reviewed the "treasure trove" of the thousands of documents that were picked up by the U.S. Navy SEALs from bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, the leaders of al Qaeda understood that the group they led was "beleaguered." CNN was given a briefing this week by senior administration officials who have been analyzing the documents.
Peter Bergen
Bin Laden wrote a 48-page memo to a deputy in October 2010 that surveyed the state of his organization. He was particularly concerned that al Qaeda's longtime sanctuary in Waziristan in Pakistan's tribal areas was now too dangerous because of the campaign of American drone strikes there that had picked off many of his key lieutenants.
According to a count by the New America Foundation, the CIA launched a record number of 118 strikes into the tribal regions during 2010, the year bin Laden wrote this memo.
Bin Laden advised his followers not to move around the tribal regions except on overcast days when America's all-seeing satellites and drones would not have as good coverage of the area.
He also urged his followers to depart the tribal regions for the remote Afghan provinces of Ghazni, Zabul and, in particular, Kunar, pointing out that the high mountains and dense forests of Kunar provided especially good protection from prying American eyes.
Bin Laden fretted about his 20-year-old son, Hamza, who had recently been released from house arrest in Iran, instructing his deputy to tell his son to move out of Waziristan. He also provided elaborate instructions about how Hamza might evade the surveillance of the American drones in the tribal regions by meeting members of al Qaeda inside a particular tunnel on the road between the western Pakistani town of Kohat and the city of Peshawar.
During his final days, bin Laden's world was filled with paranoia. He instructed that Hamza should throw out anything he had taken with him from Iran as it might contain some kind of tracking device, and that he should avoid the company of a man who might have ties to the Pakistani intelligence services.
Bin Laden also reminded his deputies that all internal communications should be made by letter rather than by phone or the Internet.
As a result, according to administration officials, bin Laden had to wait for responses to his queries to his deputies that could sometimes take up to two or three months to be delivered -- surely not an efficient way to run any organization.
Bin Laden also advised his lieutenants that when they kidnapped someone they should take many precautions during the negotiating process and also throw away any bags that contained ransom money because they might also contain a tracking device.
The spectacular set of self-inflicted mistakes made by al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq weighed heavily on the minds of bin Laden and his top advisers. Privately, they criticized the brutal tactics of al Qaeda in Iraq, which had provoked a tribal uprising against al Qaeda that had dealt a large blow to the group's position in Iraq from 2006 onward.
Until the end, bin Laden remained fixated on attacking the United States, prodding his deputy to "nominate one of the qualified brothers to be responsible for a large operation in the U.S."
According to administration officials, bin Laden's number two, Ayman al-Zawahiri, pushed back, telling bin Laden it was much more realistic to attack American soldiers in Afghanistan than American civilians in the United States.
Bin Laden did urge his followers to scope out opportunities to attack President Obama or Petraeus while they were in Afghanistan. At the time, Petraeus was the commanding general of NATO soldiers in Afghanistan.
Bin Laden noted snidely that killing Obama would pave the way for Vice President Joe Biden to assume the presidency. The al Qaeda leader said Biden was "totally unprepared" for the job.
Above all, bin Laden constantly fretted about his media image, pointing out to his deputies that "a huge part of the battle is in the media."
For the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, bin Laden wanted his media team to emphasize particularly that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were one of the main reasons for the financial crisis in the United States. (Bin Laden bought his compound in Abbottabad with cash, so presumably he didn't quite understand the dimensions of the subprime mortgage debacle.)
One of his media advisers, who U.S. officials believe to be the American al Qaeda recruit Adam Gadahn, suggested bin Laden take advantage of the 9/11 anniversary in 2011 to record a 'high definition' videotape message that could be given to all the major American news networks, except to Fox News, which Gadahn said "lacks neutrality." It doesn't appear that bin Laden made such a tape.
Administration officials say it is strange that in all the documents recovered at the bin Laden compound there is no mention at all of al Qaeda's plot to use liquid explosives to bring down as many as seven American, British and Canadian passenger planes flying from Heathrow Airport in 2006. If this plot had succeeded it might have rivaled 9/11 as a spectacular attack.
Bin Laden moved into his Abbottabad compound either at the end of 2005 or sometime in 2006 and an administration official says that, perhaps, information about the Heathrow plot "got lost in the move."

Detecting the dangers of Greenland's giant icebergs
By Frederik Pleitgen, CNN
updated 10:52 AM EST, Tue December 4, 2012
Ice Patrol helicopter flies across southern Greenland. The chopper is operated by the Danish Meteorological Institute. Giant icebergs beneath the helicopter. Some can easily be as long as an aircraft carrier. From the air it is easy to see that most of the icebergs' mass is below the water surface making it dangerous for ships to pass them. Ice observer Jane Robertson keeps a lookout for icebergs that clog shipping lanes.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins Danish meteorologists as they chart the passage of Greenland icebergs
More icebergs have been observed in recent years but experts unsure of long-term trend
Observers fly missions three times a week before filing reports on dangerous ice
Ice Patrol founded after "Greenlandic Titanic" sank off the island's coast in 1959 killing all crew and passengers Narsarsuaq, Greenland (CNN) -- Every year, we hear stories of global warming advancing and the effects that has on the earth's climate patterns.
One phenomenon that is often used to illustrate ice melt in the Arctic is giant icebergs, often the size of whole towns or even small countries, breaking off the ice shield and drifting south.
In reality, icebergs constantly break off both the arctic ice shield and Greenland's inland glaciers, a process that scientists call calving.
To find out whether that process is accelerating a CNN crew traveled to southern Greenland, to the small village Narsarsuaq, where the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) keep a unique unit of experts.
They are called the Ice Patrol and the unit consists of ship navigators and pilots who fly across the south of this vast island to monitor the movement of icebergs, to prevent collisions with cargo ships navigating in the waters around Greenland.
"If the icebergs have been traveling in the water a long time they become almost colorless and nearly invisible in the oceanJane Robertson
"We keep an eye out for icebergs that are bunched together in narrow waterways," said ice observer Jane Robertson on an airborne mission around the southern tip of Greenland. While big icebergs can pose a threat to vessels going through here, surprisingly it is smaller ice pieces that are even more dangerous.
"The smaller icebergs are much harder to detect," Robertson said as she was surveying the ice with her binoculars, "especially if the icebergs have been traveling in the water a long time they become almost colorless and nearly invisible in the ocean."
Flying over the majestic landscapes of this part of Greenland, observers see a huge amount of icebergs, some almost the size of aircraft carriers and several stories tall, others shaped in a distinctive blue coloring because the air has been pressed out of the ice in its glacial journey.
Some experts believe that the glaciers in Greenland are calving at a higher rate as temperatures rise, but the ice observers say their observations are not long term enough to speak of a general trend.

Greenland: Secrets in the Ice -- Part 2 Greenland: Secrets in the Ice -- Part 3 Greenland: Secrets in the Ice -- Part 4
Greenland: Secrets in the Ice -- Part 5
Greenland: Secrets in the Ice -- Part 6 "In the past two years there have been more icebergs here," Robertson says, "but then again in the years before there were a lot fewer so it really varies from year to years."
However, other observers point to the fact that Greenland's glaciers have been receding for years, pointing to increased ice melt in the polar region. But even on fairly clear days it takes an experienced captain to navigate a ship through the waters around Greenland.
Robertson is also an officer on the Royal Arctic Line, Greenland's own shipping company and says it takes years to understand the challenges involved sailing in Greenland.
"When you encounter masses of icebergs you can either try and go through it or you can go around it," Robertson said. "In most cases the captain will usually try and go around it if he can because no matter how slow you go and how careful you are there will always be damage to the ship and then the weather can get much worse very quickly and you don't want to be in a field of icebergs if it does."
Her experience as a ship's navigator make her so valuable as an ice observer for the DMI, but the everyone in the crew needs to be at the top of their game.
Karsten Andsbjerg pilots the helicopter through the fjords and hills in this extremely rugged terrain. A difficult task as he often deals with severe weather while having to make the ride smooth enough for the observers to do their job.
"Yeah, there are some pretty heavy and gusty winds here," Andsbjerg said shortly after landing at a Danish weather outpost right at the southern tip of Greenland.
"The other thing is that the weather changes so quickly here, you always have to call ahead to all the airfields and weather stations and keep yourself updated. Otherwise you can be in severe weather in no time."
The observers fly missions three times a week if the weather permits. Afterward they file reports on the location of dangerous ice clusters with photos that show vessels what they are in four if they try to get through. The Ice Patrol's reports are vital and may have already saved lives.
The unit was founded after a ship sank off the coast of Greenland in 1959, killing all crew and passengers on board. The MS Hans Hedtoft disaster is known as the "Greenlandic Titanic" in this part of the world.
"When you encounter masses of icebergs you can either try and go through it or you can go around itJane Robertson
Eydun Simonsen, the chief ice observer during CNN's stay with the unit said: "Just like the Titanic, it was her maiden voyage. To this day we don't know exactly what happened, but we do know that she hit an ice berg and sank with all souls on board. She did manage to send an SOS and later some rescue equipment was recovered."
There hasn't been a major incident in the waters off Greenland since the ice patrol was founded. Better satellite images and more advanced ships will also have played a role in this improved track record, but there is no doubt that captains navigating the cold and often treacherous water of the Arctic value the detailed and up to date information the observers provide.

China needs smog-free air in a can
By John D. Sutter, CNN
updated 11:00 AM EST, Fri March 1, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
This year has been one of the worst for air quality in China
Residents have termed the smog event the "air-pocalypse"
John Sutter says the country should pass a Clean Air Act
It's a matter of human rights and public health, not image
Editor's note: John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion. He heads the section's Change the List project, which focuses on human rights and social justice. E-mail him at CTL@CNN.com.
(CNN) -- Air pollution in China has gotten so bad lately that one environmentalist's wacky idea for a solution doesn't seem all that far-fetched: putting clean air in a can.
Last week, when a thick gray haze blanketed Beijing and several other Chinese cities, sending kids to the hospital, grounding planes and causing the government to order cars off the road, Chen Guangbiao took to the streets in Beijing to hand out yellow and green cans of smog-free, non-carcinogenic air.
"Free fresh air. Open it and drink it and breathe it!" the Guardian quoted the multimillionaire and national celeb as saying. "It keeps you fresh the whole day!"
Ego aside (the bright cans feature an image of Chen's face and the words "Chen Guangbiao is a good man" on them), the clever political stunt is just the sort of thing that China needs these days. Such creative and public protests should help push forward much-needed national reforms to combat air pollution in the country.
A "Clean Air Act" for China is long overdue.
John D. Sutter
And the recent "air-pocalypse," as the suffocating air pollution that hung over several Chinese cities in January has been termed, should be more than enough proof of that.
The pollution during the 2013 Great Smog of China was so thick last month that it was visible from space (from space!). Breathing in Beijing was "akin to living in a smoking lounge," according to an analysis from Bloomberg. Air quality readings literally were off the charts. An index reading below about 50 is considered healthy. Readings for Beijing in January hit 500, the top of the index, and went higher than 700, according to the U.S. Embassy.
"The air has this kind of greenish-gray pallor to it. And it smells like you're standing next to a chemical plant, really chlorine-y," said David Pettit, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. "It's an awesomely bad smell."
What causes Beijing's hazardous smog?
Dangerous smog blankets Beijing He was telling me about Beijing air on a normal day.
"I'm standing outside my office building but am unable to see its top," one Beijing resident said, according to China's state news agency, Xinhua.
"The new normal in Beijing is sending your kids to school wearing gas masks," Christina Larson wrote in Bloomberg Businessweek.
Fixing China's air pollution is not just about the country's image or economy, although those certainly suffer because of smog, too. It's about the right of all humans to walk outside and breathe in air that won't choke them or make them sick.
The AFP reports hospital visits for respiratory problems were up 20% during the air-pocalypse. Last year, small particle air pollution, called PM2.5, in four major Chinese cities resulted in 8,572 premature deaths, according to a December study by Greenpeace East Asia and Peking University's School of Public Health.
Similar deaths can and should be prevented.
And I'm optimistic they will be. For several reasons.
The first is history. It wasn't all that long ago, in 1952, that the "Great Smog" covered London in gray, sooty pollution, resulting in an estimated 4,000 premature deaths.
The government reacted by passing sweeping reforms.
Beijing experiences terrible air quality
'I haven't seen the sun' in four days
Greenpeace on Beijing's hazardous smog
Smog cloud blankets Beijing Now London is known for its real fog, not smog.
Air pollution in Los Angeles was handled in a similar fashion.
After the city's car culture created a smog problem, scientists started researching protective helmets to protect people. Others wore gas masks. But, eventually the government took action to reduce the pollution. California led the way for the nation, and in 1963, the United States passed the Clean Air Act.
That law is credited with preventing 205,000 premature deaths, 843,000 asthma attacks and 18 million child respiratory illnesses in 1990, based on the first 20 years of the law.
These changes took time. And it's unfortunate that things had to get bad before they could get better. But China, like others, is finally realizing that its air really is that bad.
Its own people are calling for the change and more vigorously than before.
More than 200 students at a Beijing high school school signed a petition asking the city to "amend air quality regulations and take specific emergency measures," according to Calum MacLeod from USA Today. And on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, Pan Shiyi, a real estate magnate, called for the country to adopt its own Clean Air Act. When he posed the idea to his 14 million Weibo followers in an online poll, nearly all of the 50,000-some people who responded said they supported that type of national legislation.
Maybe that's just one man's social media feed. But there's a history of this kind of thing working in China. In 2011, Pan successfully used his online network to press Beijing authorities to report more smog data, according to the Wall Street Journal's China blog.
It's clear the government has taken notice this time as well. Beijing implemented several emergency measures to curb smog. State media is talking about the pollution.
After speaking with a few experts, it seems clear what needs to be done: China has to reduce its reliance on coal, increase renewable energy, regulate the amount of smog-causing sulfur that can go into its diesel fuel and increase vehicle efficiency.
"It's not rocket science," said the Natural Resources Defense Council's Pettit.
There will, of course, be costs and significant challenges. China burns "nearly as much coal as the rest of the world combined," according to a recent report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Beijing catches so much of the pollution from coal-burning power plants because it sits at the center of a ring of mountains, which help trap the smog. Throw a bunch more cars into the mix, 13 million of them were sold in China last year, according to IHS Automotive and the problems start compounding.
Fixes may be expensive, but the United States has made the compelling case that the costs of enforcing clean air regulations are offset by gains in health and worker productivity. China, which does have some air quality regulations, already seems to be realizing this. The country on Wednesday announced stricter fuel standards that go into effect by the end of 2014 for diesel and 2017 for gas, according to the Financial Times. An environmental official, Wu Xiaoqing, also told state media this week that "China will formulate regulations, standards and policies to reduce air pollutants and control coal burning."
The energy industry estimates it will costs billions for China to meet tougher fuel standards. It may be up to people like artist Ai Weiwei, who posed in a photo wearing a gas mask, and Chen, the man who's peddling cans of clean air, to ensure that the public and the government see that clean air is worth the cost.
"I want to tell mayors, county chiefs and heads of big companies: Don't just chase GDP growth, don't chase the biggest profits at the expense of our children and grandchildren, and at the cost of sacrificing our ecological environment," Chen told Reuters.
If Chinese leaders don't want to drink air from a can, they should listen.

Military chiefs warn forced budget cuts undermine security By Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 12:43 PM EDT, Wed September 18, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Army chief says sequestration cuts threaten combat readiness
The House Armed Services Committee looks at forced spending cuts
Wednesday's hearing comes as Congress faces another budget showdown
Washington (CNN) -- Less money means less military, the nation's armed forces chiefs told Congress on Wednesday.
The heads of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines explained -- again -- to the House Armed Services Committee that their services will be unable to meet their strategic responsibilities if forced budget cuts in coming years take effect as planned.
The forced cuts, known in Washington-speak as sequestration, affect the military and other discretionary government spending except for entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
At Wednesday's hearing, the military chiefs all said sequestration cuts in coming years would leave their forces without the resources needed to fulfill the requirements of the Obama administration's strategic defense guidance for the military through 2020.
"These reductions will put at substantial risk our ability to conduct even one sustained major combat operation," Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno told the panel, adding that it was "imperative that Congress not implement the tool of sequestration."
Calling himself a realist, Odierno said the end result would be an 18% cut in total Army forces over seven years.
"There are some who have suggested there will be no land wars in the future," Odierno said. "While I wish that were true, unfortunately there is little to convince me that we will not ask our soldiers to deploy again in the future."
Past reductions in military readiness showed that "the full burden of an unprepared and hollow force will fall directly on the shoulders of our men and women in uniform," he added.
"We have experienced this too many times in our nation's history to repeat this egregious error again," he said.
The hearing came amid another budget war in Congress, with threats of a government shutdown in less than two weeks without a compromise.
One issue in the budget debate is whether a new spending plan should contain the sequestration cuts forced by a 2011 budget deal. Both Democrats and Republicans say they don't want sequestration, but they cannot agree on a new spending plan.
Republicans insist on holding overall spending to the level that included the sequestration cuts, while Democrats generally want to provide some more funding while adjusting spending levels.
CNN's Virginia Nicolaidis contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Pope Francis calls while nuns at a Spanish convent are praying, leaves voice mail
"What are the nuns doing that they can't answer?" he asks jokingly
Eventually Francis calls back, talks with the nuns on speakerphone
"The message from Pope Francis was to never lose hope," says prioress
Madrid (CNN) -- The nuns in a Carmelite community in Lucena, Spain, received a voice-mail message on New Year's Eve that they had to share with the world. The caller was Pope Francis.
"What are the nuns doing that they can't answer?" the Pope said jokingly. "I am Pope Francis, I wish to greet you in this end of the year, I will see if I can call you later. May God bless you!"
The nuns passed the audio message to the Spanish radio network COPE, which is linked to the body that runs the Roman Catholic Church in Spain.
The nuns were praying when Francis called shortly before noon, and so didn't answer, the radio network said.
Pope Francis leaves voice mail for nuns
When they played the voice mail back, they got a surprise.
The prioress of the convent, Sister Adriana, told the radio network she "literally wanted to die" when she first heard the message.
"Our friendship goes back 15 years but we never thought the pope would remember to think of us," she said.
After the nuns realized that they had missed a phone call from the Pope, they didn't know what to do. They consulted with their local bishop and tried to call Francis back, without success, the radio network said.
The nuns decided simply to wait in hope of another call.
Hours later, the phone rang again -- and this time they answered.
Poll: Pope's approval rating sky high
Francis talked with the community's five nuns, three of whom hail from his native Argentina, on speakerphone, COPE said.
"The message from Pope Francis was to never lose hope, because sadness leads to spiritual sloth and hopelessness," said Sister Adriana.
She added she had known Pope Francis for years and admires his simplicity and closeness to people.
The pontiff's call came on the 400th anniversary of the community.
Pope celebrates birthday with homeless
The popularity of Francis, the first pope from Latin America, is sky-high, a CNN/ORC International poll released last month showed.
Since being elected in March, he has made headlines by embracing a humble way of life, caring for the poor and people with disabilities, and reaching out to the gay community.
Are rich Catholics mad at the pope? CNN's Al Goodman reported from Madrid and Radina Gigova from Atlanta. Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.

'The Walking Dead' returns: What to expect next
By Henry Hanks, CNN
updated 11:27 AM EST, Fri February 7, 2014
Characters come and go quickly on the gruesome AMC show "The Walking Dead." Here's a look at some of the key characters we've lost.
Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) turned on his best friend, Rick Grimes, and lured him into the woods, apparently with plans to kill him and steal Rick's wife, Lori. Rick stabbed Shane, but he came back as a zombie, and Rick's son Carl had to shoot Shane to put him down.
T-Dog (IronE Singleton) was bitten helping Carol escape zombies at the prison.
Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) was killed by a zombie.
Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) died during childbirth. Her son, Carl, apparently shot her (heard, but not seen on camera) to prevent her from becoming a zombie.
Sophia Peletier (Madison Lintz) got lost in the woods. She later turned up as a zombie locked in the barn on Hershel Greene's farm. Sheriff Rick Grimes shot her in the head to finish her off.
Amy (Emma Bell) was bitten by a zombie. Her sister, Andrea, had to put her down after she revived as a zombie.
Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker) was killed by the Governor, reanimated as a zombie and put down by his brother, Daryl, who stabbed him multiple times.
Andrea (Laurie Holden) was bitten by Milton, who became a zombie after being stabbed by the Governor. She shot herself so she wouldn't become a zombie. This was heard off camera but not seen.
In one of the show's most heartbreaking losses, Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) was decapitated and killed by the Governor.
After being stabbed by Michonne, the Governor (David Morrissey) was shot to death by Lilly.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Fans have loved "The Walking Dead's" sword-wielding character Michonne
Danai Gurira was introduced as Michonne at the end of season two
Gurira tells CNN about what to expect for the second half of this season
Gurira is blown away by the fan support and having her own action figure
Editor's note: Warning: This story contains spoilers.
(CNN) -- She had the most memorable entrance of any character on "The Walking Dead" so far.
Just as Andrea was about to be set upon by a herd of walkers, a shadowy figure dispatched them -- with a Katana sword. It was one of the standout moments of the season two finale, and we would soon learn that this person's name was Michonne, a quiet warrior who had seemingly mastered how to survive in the zombie apocalypse (one bright idea: bring along a couple of chained walkers with no hands or mouths to draw away the others).
Ever since that moment, Michonne, played by Danai Gurira, has been rivaled only by Daryl Dixon in terms of rabid fans. At times, she is a silent force of nature, but has opened up a good deal to the rest of the survivors lately.
The season's midway point having ended with (spoiler alert!) a brutal attack on the prison, sending the group off in different directions, not to mention the horrifying death of Hershel. CNN spoke with Gurira about what fans can expect when the season returns on Sunday.
CNN: Michonne has been through a lot already. Where is her head after the attack at the prison?
Gurira: It was deeply trying for her and a major loss for her. The idea of finally connecting with people -- that's not easy for her at all. She's very guarded and really has serious armor on. She's slowly letting that armor chip away, opening up to people. She actually spent some time being in this community full time, so to have this happen under her watch, and to see all the trauma it causes, and the things she was trying to avoid, is very traumatic to her. She's still just starting to invest again in people.
She has suffered great loss and it's a question of how she responds to it. There are a couple of ways it could go down. We'll have to see which road she takes.
CNN: She lost a good friend in Andrea last year, and now more loss. Does she still feel a connection to this group? Would you describe her as very loyal?
Gurira: Even in the first episode this season, you see how she's very connected to Carl, bringing him comic books and candy. There are tons of little moments between her and Daryl as well. In terms of her opening up to the group, she's become very connected.
Yes, she was very loyal to Andrea, very loyal to the people with whom she goes outside of the prison. She risks her life for them. She actually really wants the best for these people. Most recently, she didn't run away, she went back to make sure that Rick wasn't killed by the Governor.
CNN: Where are things headed for the rest of season four? Is there a big difference from the first half?
Gurira: It's gonna be a very different tone. You see people going in different directions, you don't know who's going to align with whom, who's going to make it. It's going to be a whole different tone from what's been done before on the show. It's going to be very exciting and thrilling, and no one knows what's coming next. There will be very powerful moments, and very powerful character developments.
CNN: Did you have to learn any different forms of fighting or different stunts this season?
Gurira: I always like trying out different things. There are always ways that the writers will write something that will allow me to attack it in a different way. Absolutely -- we try to make things a little different than they were last time. There's always that journey I'm taking with the physical demands of the character -- I want to do as many different things as I can!
CNN: This show has a very passionate fan base, and there is certainly a big fan base for Michonne in particular. Does this still surprise you?
Gurira: It's a worldwide thing now. I was in Zimbabwe and there were fans there who would stop me on the street. It does still take me aback how much the show has resonated across culture, class and creed.
CNN: Any interesting fan moments lately?
Gurira: The one that comes to mind most immediately are two different guys who have me tattooed to them, so that was a little shocking and unexpected. I've seen about three now like that.
CNN: Do you think Michonne can be seen as someone to look up to, or do you try to play her that way?
Gurira: What you have to do as an artist is invest your character with as much life and dimension, and stick to what's written. You stay true to that -- you don't think "let me make this character someone to look up to." I don't know how to play that. All you can do is function in the character that's been crafted. However she resonates, I just have to go with that. You really can't bank on that. The beauty of the show is that -- and I share this with her -- we're not people pleasers.
And the writers are amazing, so they know exactly how to give her a story that's rich -- we have wonderful conversations and I'm able to collaborate with them in terms of what they're going for, and I give my all to that fiction.
CNN: What has been the toughest scene for you so far?
Gurira: Shooting the Hershel death scene was very difficult emotionally for us. It was very tough. That was definitely way up there.
CNN: Do you own an action figure of Michonne?
Gurira: I get given them, I don't go out and buy them. There's been a lot of stuff lately, so I don't know if I've kept up with it! The initial stuff that came out, I definitely have most of it. I've given away some of it.
CNN: Was it interesting to see yourself as an action figure?
Gurira: It was, it was! The first time I got the model -- it was very different and unexpected. It wasn't something I thought of in acting school. It was pretty darn cool! "When I get into the world, I want to have an action figure!" I never dreamed that dream, but to see it was very cool.

CNN - Nerves fray as Simpson trial winds down - Sept. 21, 1995
Nerves fray, tempers flare as Simpson trial winds down
September 20, 1995 From Correspondent Anne McDermott
LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- Marcia Clark and Johnnie Cochran will be allowed to talk as long as they like in closing arguments -- as long as they don't repeat themselves. If they do, said Judge Lance Ito, he'll shut them up. His words of wisdom to the lawyers: "Be prepared ... be ready ... be concise." Prosecutors called Los Angeles Police Cmdr. Keith Bushey to the stand Wednesday in an effort to counter a defense attack on Los Angeles Police Detective Philip Vannatter, who said he went to Simpson's house simply to notify Simpson of the murders. On Tuesday, the defense had presented witnesses who said Vannatter told them he went to Simpson's house because Simpson was a suspect. But Ito said the fact that the alleged conversations took place in casual, beer-drinking, cigarette-
smoking venues prompted him to give them little weight.
Bushey said he ordered his officers at the scene of the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman to notify the next kin, particularly O.J. Simpson, as soon as possible. Bushey said his earlier experience with the high profile death of comedian John Belushi in 1983 guided his decision. "The Belushi situation was very troubling for me personally because the time frame from that time that his body was discovered until the media had that information was very, very short, and I felt very bad at the number of his relatives who most certainly learned about his death through the media," he said. Bushey was asked if the Simpson case got preferential treatment. Yes, he said, because he knew it would be closely scrutinized. Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran pointed out that it took a while before officers carried out Bushey's order. "Would you be surprised that the notification was made after five o'clock in the morning, perhaps two-and-a-half hours later?" he asked.
"I would have preferred the notification happen before that," Bushey replied. Cochran later seemed to lose his temper with Bushey
(49K aiff or
49K wav). Then the court reporters, whose job is to record his words, lost patience with Cochran. The defense attorney sometimes speaks quickly, and speaks over answers. Tuesday, according to the transcript of a sidebar conference, Ito warned Cochran of the court reporters' anger. "They said, 'If Cochran is doing the next witness, I am quitting,'" Ito said.
Ito warned that the jurors might also be losing patience with the lawyers.
"Now counsel," Ito said, "I realize that we are all tired, and we wish this were over sooner than later, but this kind of petty bickering is not appropriate, and if you heard the snickering of the jurors as they were going out, they think it was pretty silly, too."
(144K aiff
or

Ito said he expects the jurors will hear the last of the witnesses this week. One they won't hear from is the FBI's Frederic Whitehurst, a critic of FBI agent Roger Martz. Martz testified earlier that blood samples he tested did not contain a blood preservative. In a two-page ruling Wednesday, Ito said Whitehurst had "no direct or specific knowledge concerning the testing done by Martz. To put Whitehurst on the stand would only serve to aggravate and confuse the sequestered jury," Ito ruled.
