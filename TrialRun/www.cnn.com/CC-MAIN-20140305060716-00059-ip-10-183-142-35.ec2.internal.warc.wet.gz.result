League sponsors shrink from $45K to $3K, baseball plays onStory Highlights North Rialto Little League brings small joys amid economic woes The league has seen sponsorships drop from $45,000 to $3,000 "We're all just trying to come up with enough money so that our kids can play" Next Article in Living » Read VIDEO By Paul Vercammen CNN RIALTO, California (CNN) -- The baseball diamonds and bleachers are filled with tales of moms and dads pitching in to put their kids on the field -- Foreclosureville's version of "Field of Dreams." Jim Underwood says the league has provided parents and children with relief from the economic hard times. North Rialto Little League has seen its annual $45,000 sponsorships shrink to a mere $3,000. Parents have lost their jobs, even houses, amid the nation's economic woes. But the families in this corner of California's economically ravaged region known as the Inland Empire have kept the aluminum bats swinging and the crowd roaring. Not a single game has been missed because of hard times. "Even though we are in bad times, it still brings out something good," says Janis Strong, the president of North Rialto Little League. "What worked for you a long time ago, it'll work for you now. ... That's what we're supposed to do, have family involvement." Watch Foreclosureville's field of dreams » The families and the league had no choice but to rally around each other when the sponsorships plunged. Bread-and-butter small-business sponsors closed up or lost too much revenue to help the league. The links to other financial donors were severed when parents lost their jobs at the sponsoring businesses. It's a story echoing across America's fields, gyms and rinks for youth sports programs. Parents are often struggling to raise money, even in elite leagues that in the past had large financial treasure chests. "Some of the parents who are used to putting money out every summer for these travel teams, they are saying that the dollars are a little tighter," says Abe Key, president of PONY Baseball and Softball, a nationwide organization of elite travel teams. "Those teams are not traveling as much." Don't Miss North Rialto Little League

Recession snapshots
At North Rialto, the parents of roughly 200 kids turned to both new and old fundraisers, from cars washes to candy sales to candle sales. They kept the games going while the economy kept tanking. One T-Ball team raised $990.68. North Rialto sits in San Bernardino County, which consistently ranks in the top five for highest foreclosure rates in the country. The county's unemployment rate is 12.5 percent. The Little League is steeped with tradition; some of its players have gone on to the Majors, including All-Star Jeff Conine, who played 17 years in the bigs. North Rialto coach Steve Thompson, and Cheryl Johnson, his common-law wife of 23 years, are enduring life's equivalent of a strikeout. Both got laid off this year, they're four payments behind on their home mortgage, and they lost health insurance. Johnson worked as a contract clerk at a Pontiac dealer and would be fine with a new lower-paying job. "I've been told too many times that I am overqualified and I won't stay," she says. Thompson lost his job as an automotive technician at a Chevy dealership. But that didn't stop this tireless volunteer. "This is my outlet," says the coach. "This is where I come to be out with the kids. Because it's not about me, it's about them." The couple could not afford the league fee of $100, so a little creativity was put into play. With the league unable to pay for field maintenance, it allowed some families' children to play for free or at a discount, in exchange for their parents' labor. Thompson and others water the field, lay chalk in the batters' box and compact the holes in the pitchers' mounds. Junior Padres coach Jim Underwood pitches in with the labor too. He and his family -- wife Tammy, 14-year-old son Tyler and 7-year-old son Tayler -- have been on the financial bubble. "Life was good, work was good, and everything was good," says Underwood, a land surveyor. "Then all of a sudden, bills come due, and all of a sudden, there is not enough money. It happens fast." Underwood had to start paying for his own health insurance. And without warning, the bank posted the notice for sale on their house. "We caught it three or four days before the auction," his wife says. "My mom and dad got involved and refinanced their house and lent us a lot of money to save our house." Underwood adds, "We're all just trying to come up with enough money so that our kids can play baseball and we can have an outlet." Tayler and Tyler find refuge from the family's financial troubles between the chalk lines laid down by their father. "I don't think about that stuff," Tyler says of his family's economic status. Scanning the baseball field, the boy says, "It's just an escape for me to get away from it. And I don't worry about nothing. I love it." These aren't isolated stories. Coach Danny Ruiz of the minor division Pirates, made up of mostly 9- and 10-year-olds, says his team's parents have suffered through foreclosures and job loss. Many of the parents are working extra hours to try to make up for plunging commissions or work once done by laid-off colleagues. "We had to ask some of our parents to gather up some of their used cleats that maybe their kids had outgrown, or maybe some used gloves," Ruiz says. "We had to supply some kids with used equipment just so they could play." After the game on this day, a 10-year-old boy spits sunflower seed shells through a wide smile. The Pirates found him a fielders' glove and shoes, and the league let him pay for free. "We're a nonprofit group," league president Strong says. "So we don't have to make money. We just have to have enough so the kids can come out and play."

Nigeria oil cleanup could take 30 years, U.N. says By the CNN Wire Staff U.N.: Nigeria oil cleanup lengthy, costlySTORY HIGHLIGHTSA landmark U.N. report says the cleanup could be world's largest-everThe Niger Delta's waterways are devastated from more than 6,800 spills Shell oil company admits liability for two spillsThe Delta's Bodo people are suing Shell for damages Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Restoration of Nigeria's environmentally devastated oil-producing Niger Delta region could take up to 30 years, cost $1 billion and become the largest cleanup operation in history, the United Nations said Thursday. A landmark report from the U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP) concluded that pollution from more than 50 years of oil operations in Nigeria's Ogoniland region is more far-reaching than thought. The assessment, commissioned by the Nigerian government and funded by oil giant Shell, comes on the heels of the company admitting liability for two spills in Nigeria. Nigeria's Niger Delta, the world's third largest wetland, is diverse and rich with mangroves and fish-rich waterways. But oil drilling has turned it into one of the most oil-polluted places on Earth with more than 6,800 recorded oil spills, accounting for anywhere from 9 million to 13 million barrels of oil spilled, according to activist groups. But the environmental disaster has never received the kind of attention paid to last year's oil catastrophe along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Amnesty International, which has researched the human rights impacts of pollution in the Delta, said people in the region have experienced oil spills on par with the Exxon Valdez disaster every year for the last half century. Oil cleanup could cost $1 billion

Many residents make their livelihoods from fishing and are dependent on the polluted mangroves and creeks. "This report proves Shell has had a terrible impact in Nigeria, but has got away with denying it for decades, falsely claiming they work to best international standards," said Audrey Gaughran, the monitoring group's global issues director. In a statement issued Thursday night, Shell said the two spills to which it has admitted liability amounted to about 4,000 barrels. The statement from Mutiu Sunmonu, managing director of Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, blamed most of the spills on sabotage or attempts to steal oil. "It is regrettable that any oil is spilt anywhere, but it is wildly inaccurate to suggest that those two spills represent anything like the scale which some reports refer to," Sunmonu said. He called on the Nigerian government "to end the blight of illegal refining and oil theft in the Niger Delta." In a 2009 report, Amnesty cited independent environmental and oil experts in estimating that between 9 million and 13 million of barrels had leaked in the five decades of oil operations in the Delta. It also quoted U.N. figures of more than 6,800 recorded spills between 1976 and 2001. Oil companies operating in the region believe the figures are exaggerated. In the 1990s, Shell was forced to stop operating in Ogoniland after mass protests against the lack of investment and environmental damage culminated in a military crackdown. Then, a special tribunal found Nigerian writer-activist Ken Saro-Wiwa guilty of complicity in the murders of four Ogoni chiefs. The government executed him and other activists in a move widely condemned internationally. Shell last year paid $15.5 million in an out-of-court settlement in a civil case brought by members of Saro-Wiwa's family and others. Now Shell has accepted responsibility for two oil spills in 2008 and 2009. The Bodo fishing community sued Shell in Britain alleging that oil spills in 2008 and 2009 had destroyed the environment and ruined the livelihoods of 69,000 people. Martyn Day, who represents the Bodo people, said cases like this one languished in the Nigerian court system for years, if not decades. That's why the claim was brought in London, Day said. "In the end there was no resolution, no compensation and there was no cleanup," Day said. He said Shell could have to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements. The U.N. assessment team examined more than 200 locations over a 14-month period for the assessment. Among its findings: -- Some areas that appear unaffected at the surface are in reality severely contaminated underground. -- In at least 10 Ogoni communities contaminated water has seriously threatened public health. -- In one community, at Nisisioken Ogale, families are drinking water from wells contaminated with benzene, a carcinogen, at levels over 900 times above World Health Organization guidelines. Individual contaminated land areas in Ogoniland can be cleaned up within five years, the report said. But heavily affected mangroves and swamplands will take up to 30 years. Before any clean-up can begin, the report said, ongoing contamination has to end.CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.

High court appears to lean toward Arizona in immigration law dispute
From Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer
updated 8:49 PM EDT, Wed April 25, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Roberts says it seems the federal government doesn't want to know immigration status
The solicitor general warns against state "interference" in immigration
Justice Sotomayor says the federal government's case is "not selling very well"
The court's ruling will affect similar laws in several other states
Washington (CNN) -- Parts of Arizona's sweeping immigration law received a surprising amount of support from a short-handed Supreme Court Wednesday.
States throughout the country considering their own tough immigration laws are closely following the proceedings over what has become a thorny issue.
Fed up with illegal immigrants crossing from Mexico -- and what they say is the federal government's inability to stop it -- legislators in Arizona passed a tough immigration law. The federal government sued, saying that Arizona overreached.
"If, in fact, somebody who does not belong in this country is in Arizona, Arizona has no power?" asked Justice Antonin Scalia. "What does sovereignty mean if it does not include the ability to defend your borders?"

Even liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor told the federal governments' lawyer that key parts of his arguments were "not selling very well."
Federal courts had blocked four elements of the state's Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act, known as SB 1070.
While intense oral arguments took place among the justices, outside there were competing demonstrations on the courthouse plaza, with the law's opponents saying it promotes discrimination and racial profiling. Backers say illegal immigration has created public safety and economic crises.
At issue is whether states have any authority to step in to enforce immigration matters or whether that is the exclusive role of the federal government. In dry legal terms, this constitutional question is known as pre-emption.
Other states watch for outcome
Paul Clement, lawyer for Arizona, told the high court the federal government has long failed to control the problem, and that states have discretion to assist in enforcing immigration laws.
But the Obama administration's solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, strongly countered that assertion, saying immigration matters are under the federal government's exclusive authority and state "interference" would only make matters worse.
Several other states followed Arizona's lead by passing laws meant to deter illegal immigrants. Similar laws are under challenge in lower courts in Georgia, Alabama, Utah, Indiana and South Carolina. Arizona's appeal is the first to reach the Supreme Court.
Arizona is the nation's most heavily traveled corridor for illegal immigration and smuggling.
Opinion: What if justices let states make immigration policy?
Justice Elena Kagan did not hear this case. Before taking the bench last year, she had been involved in the administration's initial legal opposition to the law as solicitor general. A 4-4 high court split would be likely to keep the Arizona law in legal limbo, preventing the four provisions of the law from going into effect but not settling the larger constitutional questions.
It would also shift the election-year fight over the issue to other states with current or pending crackdown laws.
The four Arizona provisions on hold are:
-- A requirement that local police officers check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws if "reasonable suspicion" exists that the person is in the United States illegally.
-- A provision authorizing police to arrest immigrants without warrant where "probable cause" exists that they committed any public offense making them removable from the country.
-- A section making it a state crime for "unauthorized immigrants" to fail to carry registration papers and other government identification.
-- A ban on those not authorized for employment in the United States to apply, solicit or perform work. That would include immigrants standing in a parking lot who "gesture or nod" their willingness to be employed.
Although the specific question before the high court relates to the law's enforcement, the justices could use the appeal to address the broader constitutional questions.
Mexican migration slows, but debate isn't over
During the 70-minute arguments, Clement faced relatively little tough questioning from left-leaning members of the bench.
"There will be a significant number of people who will be detained at the stop, or in prison, for a significantly longer period of time" if the state law is allowed to be enforced, warned Justice Stephen Breyer.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the provision on carrying registration is especially problematic. "Congress enacted a complete registration scheme which the states cannot complement or impose even auxiliary regulations," she said. "We want the registration scheme to be wholly federal."
But the consistently tough questions were aimed at Verrilli from conservative members of the high court.
Even before the solicitor general began speaking midway through the argument, Chief Justice John Roberts framed the debate away from what has become a major complaint about the law: that it would target mostly Hispanic people for scrutiny and detention.
"I'd like to clear up at the outset what it's not about," Roberts said. "No part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling, does it?" Verrilli readily agreed.
Later the chief justice raised more serious concerns. When enforcing other law, "the person is already stopped for some other reason. He's stopped for going 60 in a 20 (mph zone). He's stopped for drunk driving. So that decision to stop the individual has nothing to do with immigration law at all. All that has to do with immigration law is whether or not they can ask the federal government to find out if this person is illegal or not, and then leave it up to you," Roberts said to Verrilli. "It seems to me that the federal government just doesn't want to know who is here illegally or not."
Justice Anthony Kennedy echoed the thought, suggesting the federal government is not doing enough on illegal immigration, which might give states discretion to intervene. Suppose, he offered, "the state of Arizona has a massive emergency with social disruption, economic disruption, residents leaving the state because of a flood of immigrants. Let's just assume those two things. Does that give the state of Arizona any powers or authority or legitimate concerns that any other state wouldn't have?"
Kennedy was echoing what the state had long been arguing, and he later suggested there is such authority.
Verrilli argued the law would hurt Washington's ability to carry out diplomatic relations with other nations, noting, "We have very significant issues on the border with Mexico."
"Well, can't you avoid that particular foreign relations problem by simply deporting these people?" Scalia asked. "Free them from the jails and send them back to the countries that are objecting. What's the problem with that?
"We have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please Mexico. Is that what you're saying?"
The Justice Department said Arizona's population of 2 million Latinos includes an estimated 400,000 there illegally, and 60% to 70% of deportations or "removals" involve Mexican nationals.
A tale of opposing views in Arizona
The court hearing over the illegal immigration law comes at an interesting time. The Pew Hispanic Center this week released a report that found that Mexican immigration to the United States has come to a standstill.
The economic downturn in the United States and better conditions in Mexico, along with deportations and other enforcement, has led many to return to Mexico.
However, the debate continues as more than 10 million unauthorized immigrants -- from Mexico and other countries -- continue to live in the United States.
Even if immigration has slowed to lows not seen in decades, proponents of tough immigration laws want to beef up enforcement ahead of any future pressures.
After the arguments, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer expressed hope the state would prevail at the high court.
"We likely will not know the court's decision for weeks," she said. "But I am filled with optimism-- the kind that comes with knowing that Arizona's cause is just and its course is true."
The administration, backed by a variety of immigrant and civil rights groups, says allowing such discretionary state authority would hurt relations between the United States and other countries, disrupt existing cooperative efforts and unfairly target legal immigrants.
The legislation has a variety of supporters and detractors.
Republican lawmakers, outspoken Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio and various state governments were among those filing briefs supporting the law. The Mexican government, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Immigration Lawyers Association and the city of Tucson, Arizona, were among those supporting the Justice Department's side.
The outcome of the Arizona appeal could set important precedent on similar laws pending across the country.
The case is Arizona v. U.S. (11-182) and is to be the last argued before the high court this term. A ruling could come in late June, just before the justices recess for the summer.

Human to Hero: Wheelchair warrior in the world of 'murderball'
By Paul Gittings, for CNN
updated 10:40 AM EDT, Wed May 9, 2012
Garret Hickling, right, wrestles with an opponent during Canada's losing clash to eventual winners Australia at the Paralympic test event in London.
Hickling won a silver medal at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens, with Canada beating the United States in the semifinals.
The final did not go so well, with Canada losing to New Zealand. It was the second time "murderball" had been a fully-fledged sport at the Paralympics. Hickling says Canada's rivalry with the U.S. is no longer guaranteed to feature in the medal matches.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Garet Hickling is one of the top players in wheelchair rugby The 41-year-old Canadian will be targeting gold at the 2012 Paralympics
Hickling broke his neck in a fall in 1987 which killed one of his friends
He is renowned for his robust play in a sport once named "murderball"
London (CNN) -- Garett Hickling's personal motto is, "No fear -- give 110%" -- and he certainly lives up to it.
Despite having broken his neck in a 300-foot cliff fall that killed one of his friends, the 41-year-old Canadian is a legendary figure in the brutal Paralympic sport of wheelchair rugby -- or "murderball" as it was originally named.
Teams are 12-strong but only four wheelchair athletes are allowed at any time on the court, which is similar to a basketball space, with the basic aim of crossing into the scoring zone at either end while carrying the ball.
Contact between wheelchairs is allowed -- and frequent -- while players often get tipped out of their chairs as the action is fast and furious.
Human to Hero: Garett Hickling
Hickling, who took up the sport in 1993, is one of its leading players and has the scars to boot. He had to have his neck realigned in 2004, ripped his left tricep in 2008 and last year separated his right shoulder.
He has been MVP many times at major international competitions with Canada, including the 2002 world championships in Sweden, where he led his country to the gold medal.
Canada won a bronze medal when wheelchair rugby was introduced to the Paralympics in 1996 as an exhibition sport, and then placed fourth when it gained full status at the 2000 Sydney Games.
Garett Hickling: Fast facts
Lives: Ontario, Canada
Age: 41
Sport: Wheelchair rugby
Profession: Full-time athlete since 2000
Training regime: Six or seven days per week
Diet: About 3,500 calories per day
Relaxation: Watching a comedy like "Family Guy"
Silver and bronze medals have followed in Athens and Beijing for Hickling and his teammates.
Broken neck Hickling was brought up in British Columbia and played "pretty much any sport imaginable," including ice hockey, baseball and football.
But in February 1987 came the accident which was to leave him in a wheelchair.
Out with friends, tragedy struck when they fell down a 300-foot cliff. One died, the other suffered severe injuries, and Hickling broke his neck.
Determined not to let his disability curtail his sporting activities, Hickling initially took up wheelchair basketball and road hockey, but it was a meeting with Duncan Campbell, one of the Canadian founders of wheelchair rugby, which changed his life.
"He got me to come out, hit my first guy -- knocked him out of his chair -- and haven't looked back since," Hickling told CNN's Human to Hero series.
That was in 1993, when he was 23, and he has now been competing at the top level for nearly 20 years.
North American rivalry
For much of that period, Canada's players have been battling with their neighbors in the United States for global supremacy in wheelchair rugby.
Human to Hero: Mary Killman
Human to Hero: Mohamed Sbihi In the five world championships held since 1995, the U.S. has come out on top four times, with Canada's 2002 triumph in Gothenburg breaking that chain.
But the most recent championships on home courts in Vancouver saw Hickling and his teammates back in fifth spot.
Despite that setback, he still relishes the competition, particularly against the Americans.
"There's definitely a little bit of rivalry there because the U.S has been ranked number one for many, many years," he said.
"There's definitely a rivalry because we want to be there, and being such close neighbors we compete against each other a lot. "
But with the growing popularity of the sport, other countries are muscling in on the medal action.
Golden dream
Heading into the 2012 Paralympics in London, which begin in late August two weeks after the Olympics finish, Hickling believes that the destination of the gold medal is no foregone conclusion, despite the traditional U.S. domination.
Human to Hero: Veronica Campbell-Brown
Human to Hero: Nadia Comaneci
"Now, it's anybody's game. In these Olympics you actually don't know who's going to win," he said.
The result of the Paralympic test event in London last month would appear to back up Hickling's assertion, with Australia beating hosts Great Britain in the final.
Canada claimed the bronze medal, beating Sweden, but all the matches were close and high-scoring affairs.
In the likely autumn of his outstanding career, Hickling is desperate to add gold to his collection, having come so close in Athens and Beijing.
"I've always enjoyed rugby but my ultimate is to go for that gold," he said.
"That helps motivate me, makes me train harder, makes us go out six or seven days a week and try to be in the best shape we can be and ready to go out there and pound some chairs."
Sporting philosophy
As Hickling's motto suggests, he is not an athlete who leaves anything on the court.
"I try to give 110% no matter what I do, whether it's writing a paper or trying to hit a guy ... you know? It's give it all you got, whenever you can."
Despite his uncompromising attitude, Hickling has made many friends off the court, even among his American rivals.
"We do go out and have a drink or social after wards with the guys, but when it's on the court, it's game on!"

State Department upheaval follows Benghazi report
By CNN Staff
updated 6:35 AM EST, Thu December 20, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Benghazi report results in 1 resignation, 3 disciplinary administrative leaves Eric Boswell and Charlene Lamb oversaw decisions on security at the diplomatic outpost
Report shows a "massive failure of the State Department at all levels," Rep. Mike Rogers says
CNN/ORC poll: 43% are satisfied with how the Obama administration handled Benghazi Washington (CNN) -- Four State Department officials have been disciplined in the wake of a review of the security failures that led to the deaths of four Americans at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, a department spokeswoman said Wednesday.
One resigned, while three others have been placed on administrative leave and relieved of their duties, said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.
The independent review released Tuesday examining attacks that occurred last September 11 cites "systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies" at the State Department.
The failures resulted in a security plan "that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place," the 39-page unclassified version of the report concludes.
Read the full report Attackers set the U.S. Consulate compound in Benghazi, Libya, on fire on September 11, 2012. The U.S. ambassador and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack.

Cole on 'systemic failures' re: Benghazi
Benghazi three months later, no answers
Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was among those killed in Benghazi.
Eric Boswell, assistant secretary of diplomatic security, resigned, effective immediately, Nuland said.
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Charlene Lamb is among the officials placed on administrative leave, a source told CNN.
Earlier Wednesday, a senior official had told CNN that Lamb and another State Department official had resigned as well.
Boswell and Lamb oversaw security for the Benghazi mission. Lamb testified before Congress about the security precautions. Documents show Lamb denied repeated requests for additional security in Libya.
Veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering, who was chairman of the review board, said the members placed primary blame "at the assistant secretary level, which is in our view the appropriate place to look, where the decision making, in fact, takes place. Where, if you like, the rubber hits the road."
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was recovering from a stomach virus and concussion, ordered the review in the aftermath of the attack. Such reports are mandated by Congress when Americans working on behalf of the U.S. government are killed overseas.
Clinton is expected to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee about the Benghazi attack next month, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, the outgoing chairwoman of the committee, told CNN.
Read Clinton's letter to Rep. Ros-Lehtinen
Deputy Secretaries of State William Burns and Thomas Nides were to testify Thursday before the House and Senate committees.
Pickering and former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen, the review board's vice chairman, visited Capitol Hill Wednesday to brief members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees in private.
"The report makes clear the massive failure of the State Department at all levels, including senior leadership, to take action to protect our government employees abroad," said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican.
Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, who is considered the top prospect for the secretary of state job being vacated by Clinton, said the State Department "has taken a huge step forward to address the lessons learned from Benghazi."
"It's a dangerous world we're in, and I think that this report is going to significantly advance the security interests of those personnel and of our country," Kerry told reporters Wednesday.
Red Clinton's letter to Sen. Kerry A CNN/ORC poll conducted Monday and Tuesday suggests most Americans are dissatisfied with how the Obama administration has handled the aftermath of the attack, but a majority believe that the administration did not attempt to intentionally mislead the American public about that attack.
Four in 10 Americans believe that inaccurate statements by administration officials after the Benghazi attack were intended to mislead the public, while 56% said they thought those statements reflected what the Obama administration believed to be true at the time.
In all, 43% said they are satisfied with the way the Obama administration has handled the matter in the past few months; half said they are dissatisfied.
The review board cited a lack of resources as at least partly to blame for the deaths in Benghazi.
"The solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from Congress to support State Department needs," it said.
The board found that Washington tended "to overemphasize the positive impact of physical security upgrades ... while generally failing to meet Benghazi's repeated requests" to beef up personnel.
The board completed its investigation this week and sent a copy Monday to Clinton, who said in letters to the heads of the Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations Committees that she accepted all of its 29 recommendations. They include strengthening security, adding fire-safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high-threat areas.
The report says "there was no protest prior to the attacks," which were described as "unanticipated in their scale and intensity."
It also cites the Bureau of Diplomatic Security staff as "inadequate" in Benghazi on the day of the attacks and in the months and weeks leading up to it, "despite repeated requests from Special Mission Benghazi and Embassy Tripoli for additional staffing."
The report says there had been a "lack of transparency, responsiveness, and leadership at the senior levels" in Washington, Tripoli and Benghazi.
CNN Poll: Majority dissatisfied but don't think administration misled on Benghazi attack
"Security in Benghazi was not recognized and implemented as a 'shared responsibility' by the bureaus in Washington charged with supporting the post, resulting in stove-piped discussions and decisions on policy and security," it says. "That said, Embassy Tripoli did not demonstrate strong and sustained advocacy with Washington for increased security for Special Mission Benghazi."
The report says the short-term nature of the mission's staff, many of whom were inexperienced U.S. personnel, "resulted in diminished institutional knowledge, continuity and mission capacity."
The mission was also "severely under-resourced with regard to certain needed security equipment," it says.
It singles out for criticism dependence on "poorly skilled" members of the Libyan February 17 Martyrs' Brigade and unarmed local guards who were supposed to provide security. It noted that, at the time of Stevens' visit, militia members "had stopped accompanying Special Mission vehicle movements in protest over salary and working hours."
Though it said there had been no specific, credible threats on the day of the attack, the significance of the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 had led Stevens to hold meetings on the compound on September 11 of this year.
But security systems and the Libyan response "fell short" when the compound was penetrated "by dozens of armed attackers."
The report presents a detailed description of what happened that night. It says Libyan mission guards were not present, local militia fled their posts and "there simply was not enough time for armed U.S. military assets to have made a difference."
The board said it could not determine how a gate at the compound was breached, "but the speed with which attackers entered raised the possibility" that the guards had left it open.
The politics surrounding the events that led to the report have claimed one political casualty, with Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, last week pulling her name from consideration to succeed Clinton. Some Republican senators had said they would put a hold on her nomination if President Barack Obama had submitted it, based on comments, later determined to have been inaccurate, that Rice made in the days after the attack.
Benghazi problems suggest long list of changes for security of diplomats

Police: LAX dry ice explosions 'an internal job, maybe a labor dispute or a prank'
From Michael Martinez and Diahann Reyes, CNN
updated 7:53 PM EDT, Tue October 15, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Incidents at LAX "reveal a vulnerability that we're gonna shore up," deputy chief says
NEW: LAX should have cameras in public access and restricted areas, police say
"This appears to be an internal job, maybe a labor dispute or a prank," police say
Dry ice, used for shipping meats and ice cream, turns directly to vapor when warmed
Los Angeles (CNN) -- Authorities intensified their investigation Tuesday into a mystery at Los Angeles International Airport: Who's behind the explosions of dry ice in containers for two days in a row?
For the moment, police say they don't believe terrorism is at work. No injuries have been reported in the explosions.
"This appears to be an internal job, maybe a labor dispute or a prank," said Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Michael Downing. "But we do take this very seriously. This is along the lines of planting a pipe bomb.
"It's a destructive device. The detonation or possession of a destructive device is a felony," Downing added.
Dry ice bombs discovered at LAX Dry ice blast at LAX, again
Expert: Dry ice blasts no prank
The incidents demonstrated that LAX has vulnerabilities, Downing said. The airport is the sixth busiest in the world and third busiest in the United States, according to its website.
"I think it does reveal a vulnerability that we're gonna shore up and that is that you have cameras in public access areas," Downing said. "We should also have cameras in restricted access areas to maintain the integrity of the security system."
Los Angeles police Detective Gus Villanueva said there's "no nexus to terrorism at this point."
The FBI has been called in, though Los Angeles police are the lead investigating agency, said FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller.
"There's no established motive based on the evidence, and there is no articulated threat associated with the various incidents. Until a suspect or suspects are identified, it would be difficult to comment on motive," Eimiller said.
When asked if the explosions were a prank, she said: "There are many reasonable theories in a situation like this, and none have been ruled out."
Dry ice, which is carbon dioxide in solid form, is used as a refrigerant for meats and ice cream, especially when shipped in a box. When dry ice becomes warm, it transforms into vapor.
The more recent incident occurred at 8:30 p.m. Monday at the Tom Bradley International Terminal, airport police said.
CNN affiliate KCAL said the blast took place in an employee restroom, inaccessible to nonemployees.
Three plastic bottles containing dry ice were found, but only one had exploded, Villanueva said.
Police and bomb experts cleared the scene by about 9:45 p.m., KCAL reported. There were no injuries, and no flights were delayed.
On Sunday, dry ice in a plastic bottle exploded in an employee restroom at the airport, causing a brief shutdown of Terminal 2, the FBI said. No injuries were reported, and Terminal 2 resumed operations after a brief evacuation.
The airport has nine terminals.
CNN's Paul Vercammen contributed to this report.
