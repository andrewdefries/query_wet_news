Worm rot or not In some cases, I do suspect there are people whose computer is taken over by third parties. It's also a clever defense to exculpate your client.

SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Prosecutors looking to throw the book at accused computer hackers have come across a legal defense expected to become even more widespread in an era of hijacked PCs and laptops that threatens to blur the lines of personal responsibility: the computer did it.
In one case that was being watched as a bellwether by computer security experts, Aaron Caffrey, 19, was acquitted earlier this month in the United Kingdom on charges of hacking into the computer system of the Houston Pilots, an independent contractor for the Port of Houston, in September 2001.
Caffrey had been charged with breaking into the system and crippling the server that provides scheduling information for all ships entering the world's sixth-largest port.
Although authorities traced the hack back to Caffrey's computer, he said that someone must have remotely planted a program, called a "trojan," onto his computer that did the hacking and that could have been programmed to self-destruct.
In two other cases, British men were accused of downloading child pornography but their attorneys successfully argued that trojan programs found on their computers were to blame.
In all three cases, no one has suggested that the verdicts were anything other than correct.
Some legal and security experts say the trojan defense is a valid one because computer hijacking occurs all the time and savvy hackers can easily cover their tracks.
"I've seen cases where there is a similar defense and it could work or not work based on corroborating evidence" such as how technical the defendant is, said Jennifer Stisa Granick, clinical director of the Sanford Law Center for Internet and Society.
It is relatively easy to trace a hack back to a particular computer, but proving that a specific person committed the crime is much more difficult, she and others said.
Someone other than the computer owner could use the machine, either by gaining physical access or remotely installing trojan software that was slipped onto the computer via an e-mail sent to the computer owner or downloaded from a malicious Web site, they said.
"On the one hand, this is 100 percent correct that you can not make that jump from computer to keyboard to person," said Bruce Schneier, chief technology officer at Counterpane Internet Security based in Cupertino, California. "On the other hand, this defense could [be used] to acquit everybody.
"It makes prosecuting the guilty harder, but that's a good thing," he added.
Mark Rasch, former head of the U.S. Department of Justice computer crime unit, agreed.
"The more difficult problem is people could actually go to jail for something they didn't do" as a result of trojan programs, said Rasch, chief security counsel for computer security provider Solutionary. "If I want to do something illegal I want to do it on someone else's machine."
But Dave Morrell, a computer consultant for the Houston Pilots who worked with the FBI after the attack, said the defense also opened the door to hackers.
"It sets a precedent now in the judicial system where a hacker can just claim somebody took over his computer, the program vanished and he's free and clear," he said
Michael Allison, chief executive of computer forensics firm Internet Crimes Group in Princeton, New Jersey, said experts should have been able to prove if there had been a trojan on the computer in question.
The defense is likely to become more widespread especially given the increasing use of "spyware" programs that can be used by hackers to steal passwords and essentially eavesdrop on a computer user, experts said.
"The emergence of spyware will only enhance these claims," said Michael Geist, a law professor at the University of Ottawa Law School in Canada. "We're going to have to sort through the level of responsibility a person has for operating their own computer."
The trojan defense has not yet been put to the test in the United States.

Swedish wrestler throws away Olympic medalStory Highlights Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian throws away bronze medal in disgust China's Zhang Juanjuan breaks South Korean dominance in women's archery Zhang defeats defending champion Park Sung-Hyun 110-109 in a tense final Heavy rain disrupts Olympic program with rowing and canoeing all washed out Next Article in World Sport » (CNN) -- Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian threw away the bronze medal he won in the Greco-Roman category in disgust in a protest over judging in his semifinal bout. Abrahamian places his medal on the competition mat in protest at a judging decision. Abrahamian was beaten in the 84 kg class by eventual gold medal winner Andrea Minguzzi of Italy but was furious with the verdict, shouting at the referee before confronting the judges. The Athens silver medal winner had to be restrained by teammates and later went on to win a bronze medal match. But the row continued at the medal ceremony as he only grudgingly mounted the podium and after receiving his medal made a point of taking it off and leaving it in the center of the competition mat. Swedish fans in the arena disagreed strongly with the original decision, jeering the judges, while coach Leo Myllari also weighed in. "It's all politics," he said. The medal was later returned to the sport's governing body. In archery, China's Zhang Juanjuan has broken one of the Olympics' tightest strangleholds by upsetting South Korea's defending champion Park Sung-Hyun to win the women's individual gold medal. Korean women archers have won every Olympic gold since Seo Hyang-Soon first took the title at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. But roared on by a passionate home crowd, Zhang beat Park 110-109 in a tense final on a rain-swept course for a famous victory. The bronze went to second seed Yun Ok-Hee, also of South Korea, who was desperate to win a medal for her coach Moon Hyung-Cgul who is fighting thyroid cancer. Zhang beat all three South Koreans on her way to the title, setting a new Olympic record of 115 in her semifinal victory over world record holder Yun. "I have won this honor for all archers in China and I believe the future will be brighter," said Zhang. "I dreamed I could win a gold medal every day. I was well prepared. It was a hard journey but I finally made it." Zhang needed to shoot a nine on her final arrow to win, but said she never doubted she could do it. "I was quite confident," she said. "I shot the last arrow with no hesitation because I was confident." South Korea had earlier won both the men's and women's team gold medals. There was another gold for the host nation in the judo hall when Yang Xiuli won the women's 78kg competition -- China's second judo gold. Don't Miss Special: Beijing 08
Yang beat Cuban Yalennis Castillo by a contentious judges' decision in the final -- following 10 minutes of gruelling combat. The pair fought to a 1-1 draw at the end of the regulation five minutes, then traded ineffective throws to force a judges' decision, which Yang won amid roaring cheers from the home-country crowd. South Korean Jeong Gyeong Mi claimed bronze as she threw and then pinned down Brazil's Edinaci Silva. Frenchwoman Stephanie Possamai recorded her first victory in four attempts against Spanish veteran Esther San Miguel to win the other bronze medal. Naidan Tuvshinbayar won Mongolia's first ever Olympic gold medal when claiming the men's 100kg title. In the final, Naidan beat Askhat Zhitkeyev, for whom the consolation was winning Kazakhstan's first-ever Olympic medal in the sport. Naidan, who upset Athen's Olympic champion Keiji Suzuki of Japan in his opening bout, scored a waza ari with just under two minutes remaining, then added two yuko to seal the victory Azerbaijani fighter Movlud Miraliev took bronze by beating Poland's Przemyslaw Matyaszek, before celebrating with an impressive backflip, while European champion Henk Grol of the Netherlands also claimed bronze, beating Georgian Levan Zhorzholiani. Meanwhile, Chiara Cainero of Italy won the gold medal in women's skeet shooting, beating American Kim Rhode and Christine Brinker of Germany in a shoot-off. The three finished tied on 93 targets -- and Cainero hit the first two targets of the shoot-off, with Rhode and Brinker each missing one. The shoot-off continued to determine second place, with Rhode prevailing. Cainero led after qualifying with a score of 72, but she hit only 21 of 25 targets in the final round, enabling Rhode and Brinker to catch up. Rhode won gold in double trap in 1996 and 2004, but that event was eliminated for women before the Beijing Games. China's Du Li rebounded from her defeat in the first medal competition of the Games, to win gold in the women's 50-meter, three-position rifle event. Du led by one point entering the finals and shot a 101.3 to win with an Olympic record 690.3 points. Silver medalist Katerina Emmons finished with 687.7 points, while Cuba's Eglis Yaima Cruz got the bronze. The victory will ease the disappointment of Du's performance in the 10-meter air rifle event, when she was a favorite to claim the honor of winning the first gold medal in Beijing but flopped to finish fifth behind Czech Emmons, admitting the pressure of competing at home got to her. The host nation suffered a rare disappointment when the Chinese trio lost to Ukraine in the final of the women's team saber fencing. Olga Kharlan scored nine of the bout's last 13 points, leading the Ukrainian team to a surprise 45-44 victory over the China Ukraine trailed 40-36 when Kharlan entered the strip for the final round against China's Tan Xue. The first team to 45 points wins and, after Kharlan rallied to a 44-all tie, everything was riding on the final point. After both fencers attacked, the official checked video replay but awarded neither athlete a point. Kharlan then scored the winning touch to complete a remarkable comeback. In team fencing, three fencers for each team rotate over nine rounds. In her last two rounds, Kharlan outscored her opponents 21-9. China settled for the silver medal, and the United States took the bronze. The U.S. featured all three individual medalists in women's saber but were upset by Ukraine in the semifinals. Heavy rain disrupted much of Thursday's action and there was no action possible in either the rowing or canoeing events. At the Shunyi Rowing-Canoeing Park, the entire schedule was shifted to Friday, which was to be an off-day for the rowers. The rain also washed out Thursday's canoe-kayak events, including the semifinals and the final of the women's kayak singles and the men's canoe double final. The schedule has also been moved to Friday, when no competition was scheduled. Following the completion of all Thursday's medal events, China lead the way witha massive 22 gold medals. The United States have 10, while South Korea, Italy and Germany all have six. E-mail to a friend Share this on:

Regular flu season precautions advised in current outbreakStory Highlights Take standard flu season precautions to avoid infection, CDC advises Chief risk factor is traveling to areas where swine flu has been identified No vaccine for new strain exists but antiviral drugs can shorten duration Next Article in Health » Read VIDEO PHOTOSEXPLAINERMAP By Andrea Kane CNN	(CNN) -- As reports of swine flu continue to rise in the United States and around the world, the average American is probably asking, "How should I protect myself?" U.S. health officials stress the importance of frequent hand washing during outbreaks of illness.more photos » Health officials' advice is to follow common-sense precautions: Wash your hands, stay home if you're sick and listen to your local health authorities. "Very frequent hand-washing is something that we talk about time and time again and that is an effective way to reduce transmission of disease," said Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "If you're sick, it's very important that people stay at home. If your children are sick, have a fever and flu-like illness, they shouldn't go to school. And if you're ill, you shouldn't get on an airplane or another public transport to travel. Those things are part of personal responsibility in trying to reduce the impact. " So far, Mexico has been hardest hit by swine flu. Cases have been confirmed in the United States, as well as countries including Canada, New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, and Israel. "In areas with no disease yet, a lot of what we can do sounds simple and repetitive but helps," said Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director of the CDC's Science and Public Health Program. In addition to washing hands often, she recommends covering your mouth when coughing and sneezing and avoiding touching your eyes and nose in case the virus is on your hands. Swine Flu SymptomsSee your doctor if you have: Fever Cough Sore throat Body aches Headache Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea SOURCE: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention The World Health Organization calls the situation a "public health emergency of international concern," and the United States has declared a "public health emergency," likened by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to preparations for a potential hurricane. No authorities are calling the outbreak a pandemic. The CDC expects U.S. numbers will grow and recommendations will change depending on what happens in individual communities, said the CDC's Schuchat. The public should pay attention to what is happening nearby and heed the guidance of local health officials regarding school, work and public events. Because so much is still unknown at this point, the main risk factor is people traveling to areas where cases have already been identified. "However this virus may already be in other places in the United States," CDC spokesman Tom Skinner told CNN. "With enhanced surveillance, we will see more cases and that is why it makes good sense to be proactive, by doing things we know are effective in reducing exposure." Explainer: Swine flu facts » Schuchat noted swine flu symptoms are relatively general and nonspecific. "So many different things can cause these symptoms. it is a dilemma," she said. "It is a challenge that we are wrestling with. There is not a perfect test right now to let a person or doctor know exactly what this is." But Schuchat specifically advised anyone who feels ill after returning from Mexico to see a doctor. Health Library
MayoClinic.com: Influenza
Unfortunately, since this is a new strain of influenza, the flu vaccine for this past flu season offers no protection. "However, we do have anti-virals that work against this swine flu," said Skinner, referring to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). "Someone who has [swine flu], if they are treated early, the anti-flu medicines work against this." According to Skinner, health officials are still trying to figure out where exactly the virus originated, how transmissible it is and why it is mild in some cases and deadlier in others.

Obama going to Martha's Vineyard in AugustStory Highlights Obama to spend vacation with first family at Martha Vineyard in August Bill Clinton, family also vacationed in famed Massachusetts island Aides say Michelle Obama, daughters may arrive days ahead of president Next Article in Politics » From Ed Henry CNN	WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The first family is heading to Massachusetts next month for some rest and relaxation. White House aides said President Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Sasha and Malia will spend the final week of August together in Martha's Vineyard, a favored vacation spot for then-President Bill Clinton and his family in the '90s. The aides confirmed on Friday what had been rumored for months but had been kept under wraps for security and other reasons, including the fact that vacation plans are very sensitive in the middle of a painful recession. Aides have privately held open the possibility that Michelle Obama and the girls may arrive at the vacation spot a few days earlier while the president works on a variety of issues, including his push for health reform.

Volunteer State earns name as flood victims pull together Ronnie Coleman says he's just happy to be alive after chest-high water inundated his home. STORY HIGHLIGHTSTennessee officials say more than 21 dead, 27 counties labeled disaster areasWoman who was married only last week clings to tree, swims to rooftop for refugeCouple in Hendersonville tells station they escaped car, swam a mile to safety Mother pleads to God for help finding son, who was swept away in a carSee how the cleanup in Nashville is going and how some of country music's biggest stars are contributing to those in need. Watch "AC360°" at 10 p.m. ET Friday. Nashville, Tennessee (CNN) -- Tennessee is living up to its Volunteer State moniker as residents grapple with the aftermath of deadly flooding that left widespread damage and an untold number of displaced residents in its wake. Neighbors are rescuing neighbors. Strangers are chipping in to clean up devastated homes and businesses. Although many have lost everything tangible, their optimism remains intact. "I'm alive," Ronnie Coleman said. "Everything else, the rest of my life, if I have to fight cancer or whatever -- hey, man, it's going to be a piece of cake to what I went through." After two days of torrential rain, Coleman waded through chest-high water this weekend at his home in the Whites Creek suburb of Nashville -- a daunting task for a man who can't swim. His neighbor, Willie Mae Stricklandjordan, whose every belonging was ruined in the flooding, described what happened when Whites Creek overflowed: "The water just gushed in -- and it had a force to it." Another neighbor, Evelyn Pearlbell, said she had to be rescued. "They put this rope around me and pulled me through this water," she said. "Scary. Phew, I was so scared." As of Friday morning, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said that 21 people had died, one from natural causes. Davidson County was hit the hardest, with 10 fatalities. The federal government has declared 27 counties major disaster areas, the agency said. Aid and supplies were flowing in to Tennessee, including 167 truckloads of water. Country singers, who hold Music City USA dear, pledged monetary donations, and some converged on Nashville to help with the cleanup. Video: Nashville search and rescue

Reports of rescues emerged from the Coast Guard, local rescue teams and average citizens as helicopters and boats canvassed the region for survivors. Nashville's police and fire departments were going door-to-door, making sure homes were evacuated. They tied yellow caution tape to the doors of places that had been cleared. Ben Perkins said he and his son, Will, searched for survivors for about seven hours in Bellevue on Sunday, rescuing people from the River Plantation subdivision and from stranded cars on a nearby highway. They initially took their boat to Will's great-grandmother's house, but she had been rescued, so Perkins began looking for others in need. Will manned a cellular phone, acting as a "control center" during the 15 to 18 rescue trips, his father said. "Tennessee's come together. Nashville's come together," Perkins said. "There's a lot of devastation. There's going to be a lot of need for donations." Even with all the rescue operations, many residents had close calls. Betty Belle Nicks had to cling to a tree and then swim to the rooftop of her new home for refuge. Three small dogs made it to the roof and were saved, but Thursday night, she was looking for her yellow Labrador retriever, Ben, who swam away. "If we could find Ben, it'd be the best wedding gift in the world," said Nicks, who was married last week. Jamye Howell was driving his Jeep through Hendersonville on Sunday when he drove over a bridge and through what he thought was a puddle -- just "water standing on the road," he told CNN affiliate WZTV. "Immediately, water was flowing in the car, and there was water flowing up on the windshield instantly," said Andrea Silvia, who was in the car with Howell. "We decided that we needed to get out on top of the car and hope for the best," Howell told WZTV. The two swam about a mile to safety, they told the station. As the water continued to recede and rescue tales emerged Friday, many were struck by the devastation the flooding had wrought. Others still searched for loved ones, holding out hope that they may still be alive after almost a week. Nashville has a spirit that won't be put down, so yes, I have no doubt that Nashville will come back.--Resident Brenda Griffiths

In Pegram, cadaver dogs searched Thursday along the Harpeth River for Danny Tomlinson, a 39-year-old amateur fighter who works for a prosthetics company. Friends and family members joined the effort, which had been ongoing for five days and had covered an almost 15-mile stretch of river. His car, which was swept away Saturday, was found Tuesday. A friend who was also in the car was found alive. Tomlinson's mother said, "I'm trying to stay strong because I've got to have hope that they're going to find my son. I want to find him alive." She pleaded to a higher power for help: "Please, God, guide us. If he is in the water, which I don't want to think that, guide us there. Guide us to him -- for closure." With more disaster declarations looming and residents and officials left to wonder the true toll of the weekend's deluge, several Tennesseeans said they felt confident that the area would persevere. "Nashville has a spirit that won't be put down, so yes, I have no doubt that Nashville will come back," said Brenda Griffiths, who wore plastic bags over her feet as she assisted with the cleanup effort in Bellevue. Back in Whites Creek, evacuated residents said they feared returning home to see the devastation, but Reba Perkins said, "We prayed that whatever we found, it would be something we could learn from." Carolyn Phillips said the flooding left her worried about her future, but optimism had not escaped her. "I'm going to be OK," she said. "We're going to be OK."CNN's Anderson Cooper, Martin Savidge, Gary Tuchman and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.

Racism row shines light on Serbian football
By John Sinnott, CNN
updated 5:24 PM EDT, Wed October 17, 2012
England midfielder Danny Rose claims he was subjected to monkey chants before, during and after the second-leg of their Under-21 Euro 2013 playoff match against Serbia on Tuesday, and had stones thrown at him by the crowd in Krusevac. Fans also ran on to the pitch and scuffles broke out after a 1-0 win secured England qualification for Euro 2013.
The Macedonia FA were fined $26,000 after fans racially abused England trio Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell and Emile Heskey during a qualifying game for Euro 2004.
In September 2011, Bulgaria were fined $55,000 after a small number of fans directed monkey chants at England's Ashley Young, Cole and Theo Walcott during a Euro 2012 qualifier in Sofia.
Russia was hit with a $38,000 punishment after supporters made monkey noises towards Czech Republic defender Theodor Gebre Selassie during Euro 2012 The Croatian FA were ordered to pay a $16,000 fine after their fans were found guilty of "displaying a racist banner and showing racist conduct during the Euro 2008 quarter-final tie against Turkey.
Russia were again in the news for the wrong reasons at Euro 2012 and were fined $39,00 for "the setting off and throwing of fireworks by Russia spectators, displaying of illicit banners and the invasion of the pitch by a supporter," during the Euro 2012 tie against Poland. Russia was also fined $155,000 after clashes between supporters and police during and after their game against the Czech Republic.
Denmark's Nicklas Bendtner was given a one-match ban and a $126,000 fine after he lifted his shirt to reveal a betting company's logo on his underwear while celebrating a goal against Portugal in a Euro 2012 group game. Porto were hit by a $27,000 fine after their fans were found guilty of subjecting Manchester City forward Mario Balotelli to monkey chants during a Europa League game in February 2012. It took UEFA six weeks to finally hand out a punishment. But questions were raised after UEFA also fined City $40,000 after the club were found guilty of coming back out on to the field of play late after the halftime interval.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
English FA launches racism complaint against Serbia following under-21 match
England's Danny Rose claims he was racially abused throughout Tuesday's tie
Serbian FA denies that there were any occurrences of racism
English PFA chairman Clarke Carlisle calls for Serbia to be banned from international football
(CNN) -- Back in February the worldwide union for professional footballers FIFPro, conducted a survey of thousands of players in Eastern and Southern Europe, detailing the true extent of match-fixing, racism and violence in European football.
Just over nine percent of respondents in FIFPro's Black Book survey reported examples of racism or other forms of discrimination, mainly caused by supporters (65.3%).
The survey included the testimony of Dragisa Pejovic of FC Novi Pazar, who detailed what it was like to play football in Serbia.
"I have played for FC Borac Cacak for six years," said Pejovic. "In that time, there were always problems of violence and racism.
'It's Not Black & White'
Football pioneer on racist abuse "I remember a game where fans of my team insulted my colleague from Zimbabwe, Mike Tamvanjera, because he is a black man. This was the first case of racism in Serbia and the racism is still present."
But it wasn't just racism that Pejovic encountered.
"I do not know any professional player in Serbia who has been able to provide the most basic requirements for life," added Pejovic.
"Football in Serbia is full of crime and criminals and I could not cope, nor fight, with them alone.
"The criminals in Serbian football always look after their own interests first and use all means to achieve their goals, while the players have to keep silent and suffer."
UEFA should ban Serbia from international tournamentsClarke Carlisle
Fast forward to October and Serbia is facing more scrutiny after England's Football Association reported "a number of incidents of racism" to European governing body UEFA following the second-leg of an Under-21 Euro 2013 playoff match on Tuesday.
Danny Rose, a midfielder on loan at English Premier League side Sunderland from Tottenham Hotspur, claims he was subjected to monkey chants before, during and after the match, while also alleging he had stones thrown at him by the crowd during the game.
Rose was given a red card for kicking a ball into the stands after England scored a winning goal with the last kick of the match, sparking a mass brawl between both sets of players and staff.
Genocidal war
The Serbian Football Association painted a very different picture of events on Tuesday, saying it "absolutely refuses and denies that there were any occurrences of racism before and during the match at the stadium in Krusevac".
However, that view was directly contradicted by the Serbian technical director Savo Milosevic who went into England's dressing room after the game to apologize.
"I have a lot of friends in England, I played there," referring to his spell playing for Aston Villa between 1995 and 1998. "I feel terrible about what happened because the people in England received us really well and I wanted to give them the same thing in Serbia."

UEFA has subsequently charged both the English and Serbia FAs following events in Krusevac.

He called on UEFA to impose "tough sanctions" on racism while sports minister Hugh Robertson has written to European governing body's president Michel Platini following "extreme provocation and racism" during Tuesday game.
Over the last year English football has had to grapple with the fall out of racism cases involving Liverpool striker Luis Suarez and Chelsea defender John Terry, with English FA punishing both players.
The difficulty for Serbia, as shown by Pejovic's testimony, is that it has a history of racism not just at club level but also at international level, which Milosevic acknowledged, though he insisted that the problem "is no more than in other European countries".
Five years ago, during another U-21 match between England and Serbia, the Balkan country was fined £16,000 ($26,000) by UEFA for racial abuse directed at England defender Nedum Onouha.
In February 2011, Platini warned Serbia and its clubs that a ban on competing could be imposed if fans continued to cause trouble.
"It's important to remember that Serbia has only just come out of a genocidal war and that as events on Tuesday unfolded in Belgrade, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is on trial in The Hague," said professor Clifford Stott, who has advised governments and police forces internationally on crowd management policy and practice, referring to Balkan wars between 1991 and 1999.
"So we shouldn't be surprised these societal problems manifest themselves in football," added Stott, who runs his own consultancy and training company Crowd and Conflict Management Ltd.
"What we are seeing is a failure of various authorities to regulate behavior inside Serbian stadiums.
Unfortunately we have a lot of problems inside our country and our government right now. In the last 10-15 years we've had other problems besides football supportersSavo Milosevic
"Over the last two years UEFA has been trying to address the problem in Serbia. It is fully aware of the problems that exist there -- and working with the European Union Think Tank -- has been undertaking visits to Serbia to initiate reforms, but clearly these interventions haven't yet worked.
"What happened reflects a lack of proper regulation within the stadiums, and the effective management of crowds through legislation, policing, stewarding and also stadium licensing."
Heysel
During the 1980s, UEFA banned English clubs from competing in its club competitions for a number of years after the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.
The English Professional Footballers' Association chairman Clarke Carlisle believes UEFA must impose a similar sanction on Serbia -- if the racism allegations are proven.
"UEFA should ban Serbia from international tournaments," said Carlisle. "I believe that this is what happened to England when violence and hooliganism came to the fore and that was what caused us to address the problem.
"It's only a ban of this nature, which has these ramifications, that will cause Serbia as a football nation to address it."

Professor Stott also backed Carlisle's call for UEFA to act decisively.
"I would argue that UEFA now need to impose an effective sanction," said Stott, who is a visiting professor at Denmark's Aarhus University.
"I would support calls to ban Serbia from international football and their clubs from European football if such racist activity occurs.
"Out of all the agencies that have influence -- the EU, the European Council, the Serbian government and FA, UEFA is the most powerful in these circumstances.
"Don't forget this is ultimately about money and a ban in UEFA competitions will hit the Serbian Football Association and the clubs in the pocket. These international and European fixtures are key sources of revenue."
Ahead of the recent Euro 2012 tournament, Stott collaborated in the running of a Pan-European police training program to share best practice among the continent's police forces.

Mourinho: John Terry is not a racist
"Lots of European countries were involved, but countries like Serbia, Croatia and Greece were not," added Stott.
Government intervention
The academic urged the Serbian government and its football association to lead by example.
"The Serbian government has to make it an offence to actually monkey chant in a stadium. It is in the UK, but I'm not convinced it will be in Serbia. If it's not an offence the police can do nothing about it nor the FA even if they wanted to.
"At the same time the FA and the clubs need to create an environment of authority and governance to regulate behavior and expel those involved in it inside the stadiums.
"In the UK we have CCTV, seated stadia, ticket numbers to identify which seat someone is sitting, shared information agreements between police and clubs, effective stewarding, police steward frameworks of co-operation.
"That all comes back of the Taylor report," added Stott, referring to Lord Taylor's recommendation to improve stadium safety following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989.
"All of this stuff has to be in place to move the situation forward in Serbia. As you have seen the Serbian FA have simply denied it took place, and the idea of getting anti-racist legislation enacted in Serbia is almost surreal."
Read: UEFA to take action against Lazio
Milosevic accepted that action was needed from the Serbian government.
"The only difference I see is the actions of the governments in the respective countries. Some countries are more decisive and more powerful and they deal with it," said the former Aston Villa striker.
"Unfortunately we have a lot of problems inside our country and our government right now. In the last 10-15 years we've had other problems besides football supporters."

Leonid meteor shower set to feature sea of shooting stars
By the CNN Wire Staff
updated 11:22 PM EST, Fri November 16, 2012
The Leonid meteor shower is caused when Earth passes through debris from Comet Tempel-Tuttle.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The Leonid meteor shower occurs every year in mid-November
It happens as the Earth passes a comet's debris that's now in its orbital path
A NASA expert predicts 15 to 20 meteors per hour this year
(CNN) -- Mother Earth, it's shower time.
The planet won't be awash in water early Saturday, but rather meteors. It's part of an annual astronomical event known as the Leonid meteor shower, falling in mid-November as the Earth passes through debris from Comet Tempel-Tuttle.
"We're predicting a normal year of 15 to 20 meteors per hour," said Bill Cooke of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, according to a story on the space agency's website.
The fun begins Friday night, with the peak activity expected around 4:30 a.m. ET the next morning, according to NASA.
For those wishing to wish on a shooting star, Cooke recommends bundling up, getting away from the city lights and lying on your back (assuming you are able to still stay awake in doing so).
One thing that stargazers have working to their advantage, assuming clouds don't muddle the festivities, is the fact the moon is in a crescent setting, meaning its light is less likely to obscure the show.
Thankfully, there's no chance the Earth will crash into Comet Tempel-Tuttle this year. It was last in the solar system's inner orbit and closest to our planet in early 1998, NASA explains, and it won't be back for another 33 years.
But it left "a stream of dusty debris," known as Leonid meteors, when it moved on through. Some of these remnants have drifted into the Earth's orbital path -- and when our planet passes by, the meteors seem to be falling from the area of the constellation Leo, the lion.
The relatively small bits of rock will enter the planet's atmosphere though they won't get far, burning up before they can hit the Earth, according to StarDate magazine, which is a product of the University of Texas' McDonald Observatory.

How Islamists are gaining ground in Syria
By Ivan Watson, Kareem Khadder and Saad Abedine, CNN
updated 8:04 AM EST, Fri February 22, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Hard-line Islamist groups like the Nusra Front are becoming more popular in Syria

The United States blacklisted the Nusra Front in December, labeled it terrorist
Istanbul (CNN) -- A year ago, Ibrahim Qobani was an idealistic 19-year-old revolutionary who sang about freedom.
Always dressed in a scarf and fingerless gloves woven with the colors of the Syrian rebel flag, Qobani worked with a team of pro-democracy activists in Syria's northern Idlib province. He would sing from the rooftops during boisterous anti-government protests, complete with humorous animations that begged the international community to help stop Syrian government atrocities.
READ: Syrian official: 'We have already won'
But today, Qobani appears much different in a series of YouTube videos.
Gone is the scarf with colors of the rebel flag. Instead of leading the chants, the young man stands in the crowd smiling as one man sings, "We destroyed America with a civilian plane, turned the World Trade Center into a pile of dirt. If you call me a terrorist, I say it's an honor."
In another video, Qobani stands cheering with a crowd of bearded men as a little boy sings, "Our commander is Bin Laden. He showed the Americans the strength of our faith." A man gives the boy a knife, which he proceeds to slice through the air as he sings, "Our police is Nusra. Just wait Alawites. We will come to slaughter you."

Syrian civil war in photos
It was a chilling warning to the minority religious sect of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has stacked the top ranks of his security forces with fellow Alawites.
Qobani declined several requests to speak with CNN. Several of his friends, however, confirmed that he is now a member of Jabhat al-Nusra, or the Nusra Front, the most famous of the hard-line Islamist rebel groups now fighting against the Syrian regime.
Qobani's ideological evolution is symbolic of a broader shift that many Syrians say they're seeing nearly two years after the anti-government uprising began.
"There is an increasing militarization and now increased radicalization of the revolution," said Rafif Jouejati. She is the English spokeswoman for the Local Coordination Committees in Syria, one of the first groups to organize peaceful anti-government protests in the spring of 2011.
"Jabhat al-Nusra continues to make gains," Jouejati said. "They continue to increase in popularity, particularly as they begin to implement social services."
In the last year, the Nusra Front has grown from a shadowy group claiming responsibility for deadly car bombs to what Syrians describe as a highly disciplined fighting force that continues to attract recruits from the more secular Free Syrian Army rebels.
Nusra Front fighters are said to be leading the ongoing siege of the Khweiris military airbase in Aleppo province. They are also credited with helping lead the capture of the Taftanaz helicopter airbase in Idlib province last month.
Opinion: Terrorist group fills power vacuum among Syria rebels
The high-profile Islamist victories on the battlefield have been accompanied by another trend. Gradually, black Islamist banners have replaced the distinctive green, black, white and red flags of the Syrian rebels at weekly anti-government protests.
"After two years of killings and butchering and the entire world standing by and watching us, now we depend on God only. So we started raising the banner of Shahada, the black banner of war," explained a Syrian activist who has spent much of the last two years organizing anti-government protests in Idlib province.
The Shahada refers to the Islamic creed "There is no god but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God." It is one of the most important pillars of Islam. It is also invoked for martyrdom on the battlefield.

The rapid rise of hard-line Sunni Muslim groups like the Nusra Front -- some of which have seen their ranks swelled by foreign jihadi fighters -- is a trend that makes Jouejati and other more secular revolutionaries deeply uncomfortable.
It is also making Washington uneasy. In December, the U.S. government blacklisted the Nusra Front, labeling it a terrorist organization.
"We blacklisted the Nusra Front because of its intimate links with al Qaeda in Iraq ... which is responsible for the killing of thousands of Iraqis and hundreds of Americans," said Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, in an interview with CNN last month. "We know what al Qaeda in Iraq did and is still doing, and we don't want it to start doing that in Syria."
But some Syrian opposition leaders blame Western inaction for the recent growth of the Islamist groups.
"The U.S. and the European Union didn't help us, and that created an increase in Islamic radicalism here," said Marwan Gayed in an interview in Aleppo last month. Gayed was a judge who defected from the Syrian government and helped launch the United Courts Council, an opposition-run court that is trying to institute law and order in rebel-controlled parts of Aleppo.
Like many in the opposition, Gayed has viewed Islamist groups like Nusra as uneasy partners in the campaign to overthrow the al-Assad regime.
"They are our brothers in the revolution. They bleed for it. But we differ on how to build the state," explained Gayed, who now serves as the chief prosecutor for the United Courts Council. "We call for a civil, democratic nation. They call for an Islamic state."
U.S. branding of al-Nusra may have unintended consequences
Members of the Nusra Front declined to meet face to face with CNN journalists. Instead, Salem Sabbagh, the spokesman for the Nusra Front in Aleppo, answered several questions submitted in print.
He wrote that the main object of the group in Syria was "to establish an Islamic state that can be based on the principles of the shura (consultations) where righteousness and justice will prevail based on applying God's laws."
"We already started carrying out God's law in some of the liberated areas," Sabbagh added. "And we noted a great reception among the people when it comes to these religious courts, especially when they discovered that these courts were not as some portrayed and tried to distort their reality that such a court system will enslave them and that their heads will be severed and that their only salvation is when they choose a secular Western-oriented system that can rule among them."
Competition between the United Courts Council and courts backed by the Nusra Front exploded this month. On Tuesday, the council accused Nusra Front fighters of raiding one of its courthouses in Aleppo.
"Jabhat Al-Nusra stormed the Second Circuit United Judicial Council and seized the building of the Council and attacked scholars and judges who were there and they beat them and insulted them and then they kidnapped them to Jabhat al-Nusra's headquarters," said the council in a written statement also signed by a group calling itself the Free Aleppo Lawyers.
Rebel court fills void amid Syrian war
It is not the first time tensions have flared between the Nusra Front and other revolutionaries.
One of Aleppo's most famous anti-government activists, a man known as Abu Maryam, told CNN he was briefly detained and flogged by Islamist fighters last week.
After his release, Abu Maryam posted a photo on Facebook of his bruised back.
"They accused me of protesting against the caliphate," Abu Maryam said in a brief interview with CNN.
Asked whether he thought the Nusra Front was taking over Syria's uprising, Abu Maryam said, "Yes, of course, that's true, but it's all because of the mistakes of the Free Syrian Army."
Nearly two years into the uprising, the rebel Free Syrian Army continues to be dogged by accusations of corruption.
In recent weeks, activists have mounted an online campaign accusing Ahmed Afash, a prominent commander based in Aleppo, of banditry and kidnapping. Afash has denied the charges.
But last week, a detachment of Afash's fighters raided the offices of the Aleppo Media Center. They briefly detained several Syrian journalists who had published reports that Afash's brigade had killed an innocent civilian.
Meanwhile, Islamist groups like the Nusra Front have been applauded for distributing food and fuel to hungry, freezing Syrians.
The Nusra Front also launched a cheap public service in rebel-controlled parts of Aleppo.
"Not only do they do the fighting, but they also perform a lot of civil duties such as cleaning roads, manning bakeries, installing and repairing city infrastructure like electricity," said the activist from Idlib province, who asked not to be named. "Some of the Nusra Front members are now playing even the role of street cleaners because of garbage in the city that has increased the rat population."
Even Syrians who criticize the Nusra Front concede the Islamists have offered hope to some members of a society traumatized by a brutal conflict that has claimed more than 70,000 lives and left millions of people homeless.
As Islamists within the uprising continue to attract support, leaders of the Free Syrian Army have been left fuming, blaming a lack of Western engagement for the ideological shift in the uprising.
"We see the Islamist factions gaining more ground, recruiting some of our own people," said Louai Miqdad, a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army.
"The world is handing Syria over to the unknown, to the radicals, to the Islamists."

Al Qaeda's boss asserts himself
By Peter Bergen, CNN National Security Analyst, and Jennifer Rowland, Special to CNN
updated 4:51 PM EDT, Tue June 11, 2013
Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is able to communicate with affiliates in Syria and Iraq.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
President Barack Obama said al Qaeda's core is headed for defeat
Peter Bergen: Terror group's leader is still acting as if al Qaeda matters
He says Ayman al-Zawahiri intervened to block merger of Iraqi and Syrian wings
To avoid tracking, al-Zawahiri likely using a courier to deliver messages, Bergen says
Editor's note: Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a director at the New America Foundation and the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad." Jennifer Rowland is a program associate at the New America Foundation. (CNN) -- In the most comprehensive speech he has delivered on terrorism, President Barack Obama declared last month that the "core of al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan is on a path to defeat."
On May 23, the very same day that Obama delivered this keynote speech at the National Defense University in Washington, Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of the core of al Qaeda, fired off a lengthy memo to two al Qaeda affiliates in the Middle East.
This memo demonstrates Zawahiri considers himself and the al Qaeda core to be still relevant and very much in charge of the global jihadist movement.
Peter Bergen The Zawahiri memo, which was published on Monday by the Al Jazeera news network in the original Arabic, is addressed to the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq and the leader of Syria's Jabhat al-Nusra, which is a front organization for al Qaeda, according to the State Department.
In the memo, Zawahiri chastises the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, in a tone that an irritated parent might use, for announcing in April the merger of the Iraqi and Syrian wings of al Qaeda "without asking permission or receiving advice from us and even without notifying us."
Zawahiri also unloaded on Sheikh Abu Muhammad al-Joulani, the leader of the Syrian wing of al Qaeda, who at the same time had publicly announced his allegiance to Zawahiri and the core of al Qaeda. Zawahiri complained that the Syrian branch of al Qaeda had publicly outed itself as an al Qaeda affiliate "without having our permission."
He instructed that the merger of the al Qaeda's Iraqi and Syrian wings "be dissolved" and that the Syrian wing is "under the (al Qaeda) general command."
Zawahiri said he made these decisions "after holding consultations with my brothers in Khorosan," an ancient word for the region that today contains Afghanistan, which indicates that Zawahiri is able to communicate with, or perhaps even meet with, al Qaeda leaders along the Afghan-Pakistan border.
Why does this matter? It matters because "Al Qaeda Central" is now trying to assert control over two of its most virulent affiliates.
Is Iraq unraveling?
Al Qaeda in Iraq has mounted a series of spectacular attacks over the past year, which demonstrates that it is a force to be reckoned with again in Iraqi politics.
The Congressional Research Service reported this month that there were some dozen days in 2012 in which al Qaeda carried out multicity attacks that have killed hundreds of Iraqis.
And the al Qaeda affiliate in Syria is widely acknowledged to be the most effective fighting force that is now fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
A long-term safe haven for this group in Syria, which is in the heart of the Arab world and next door to Israel and that is now directed by al Qaeda Central, could create an organization with the intention and capability to attack the West.
That Zawahiri continues to try to assert his control over al Qaeda-affiliated groups is not all that surprising considering that Osama bin Laden did the same thing while he was holed up in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, for the last five years of his life before he was killed by a Navy SEAL team in early May 2011.
Documents found at the Abbottabad compound show that al Qaeda's founder was deep in the weeds of key personnel decisions.
In a letter to the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, bin Laden was adamant that Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki not become that affiliate's new leader. Awlaki never did get promoted and was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.
The mere existence of the Zawahiri memo shows that he is able to communicate with relative ease with al Qaeda's affiliates in the Middle East. Because of the now-well documented dangers of using any kind of electronic communication system, Zawahiri, like bin Laden before him, is almost certainly using a courier network to hand-deliver his letters.
In closing his letter to al Qaeda's affiliates in Syria and Iraq, Zawahiri appointed a man named Abu Khalid al-Suri to resolve any future disputes that might arise between the two groups.
It isn't clear to what extent al Qaeda's affiliates in Syria and Iraq will actually pay attention to directives from Zawahiri but it is a fact that these affiliates have pledged their allegiance to him.
If the core of al Qaeda is indeed on the road to defeat as Obama asserted three weeks ago, Zawahiri clearly hasn't gotten this message.

Earthquake-proof table uses geometry to save lives
By Arion McNicoll and Stefanie Blendis, CNN
updated 5:19 AM EDT, Mon August 5, 2013 | Filed under: Innovations
How can this table save lives? Designed by young Israeli Arthur Brutter and his former lecturer Ido Bruno, it can resist even the most severe of earthquakes and could offer reliable shelter to millions of people living in earthquake prone areas.
When an earthquake strikes, the common drill in schools is for children to seek refuge beneath a table. If the ceiling caves in, a table can act as protection from falling debris.
However, as Brutter and Bruno proved, a typical table is not strong enough to resist significant blows and hiding underneath can have catastrophic consequences.
The two designers set out to build an earthquake-proof table that can withstand significant pressure and improve chances of survival.
The earthquake-proof table "transforms energy and absorbs it," says Brutter. "When something falls on the table it absorbs the object's energy, and debris is forced to the side."
It is designed so that weight is spread across it and tests have proved that the structure can endure up to a ton of falling weight.
The table is not only strong enough to resist large amounts of pressure but is light enough for two children to lift it and can provide a makeshift walkway to aid rescue efforts.
Initially the table was tested by the Israeli military but currently it is undergoing tests in southern Israel and awaiting official approval from the world-leading Structural Engineering department of Padua University in Italy.
The earthquake-proof table has been nominated for a number of awards including the Design Museum's design of the year award in London. It has also been acquired by New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) for its permanent collection of architecture and design.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Israeli designers build affordable earthquake-proof table
The new design could be valuable in schools, especially those built near geological fault lines or in developing countries
The table is light enough for two children to lift, but sturdy enough to withstand a ton of falling debris
(CNN) -- "Drop to the ground; take cover by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and hold on until the shaking stops."
This is the official advice issued by FEMA for anyone unlucky enough to be caught in an earthquake.
But even following this advice isn't always going to be enough, particularly if you have nothing solid to shelter beneath.
This was the concern guiding Arthur Brutter and Ido Bruno when they dreamed up the earthquake-proof table -- an invention that aims to provide affordable protection to people in earthquake-prone areas of the world.
Read: The 12 best designs from the past 100 years
"The earthquake-proof table started when I was a student in industrial design at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem," says co-inventor Arthur Brutter. "At the beginning I wanted a solution to help in natural disasters ... I looked at pictures of a school that was crushed in the earthquake in Haiti and they really shocked me."
The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a catastrophic event that devastated the small Caribbean island and its surrounds. Official estimates suggest that up to 200,000 people died in the destruction. After seeing photographs of the aftermath, Brutter resolved to build a product to help save lives of people trapped in structurally unsound buildings during earthquakes.
Brutter, alongside his former lecturer Ido Bruno, devised a cheap reinforced table that would be light enough for two school children to be able to lift, yet still strong enough to withstand up to one ton of pressure from above.
Brutter says that the geometries of the earthquake-proof table are designed to spread weight evenly across the table's surface, ensuring that the structure holds its shape, even when subjected to significant down-force.

The earthquake-proof table "transforms energy and absorbs it," says Brutter. "When something falls on the table it absorbs the object's energy, and debris is forced to the side." In the event of a building's collapse, the tables are also designed to form passageways through the debris to help assist in rescue efforts.
The table was initially tested by the Israeli military and is currently awaiting official approval of the world-leading Structural Engineering department of Padua University, Italy, where more tests have been carried out.
Brutter and Bruno estimate that 300 million children live in areas of the world prone to earthquakes with weak school buildings. Dr Richard Luckett, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey, says that this estimation strikes him as reasonable: "there are a lot of cities in regions where large earthquakes can be expected and many of these are in the developing world."
Since its invention last year the earthquake-proof table has been nominated for a number of awards including the Design Museum's design of the year award in London. It has also been acquired by New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) for its permanent collection of architecture and design.

Bruno says the awards are nice, but what is more important is to see the product adopted broadly, and used to save lives. "It's always a good feeling to be recognised, but really it's not awards but exposure leading to the possibility of the table being used ... we want there to be no earthquakes, and we want it (the earthquake-proof table) to be used to save lives."

Colorado shooting victim described as sweet, smart, a horse lover
By Steve Almasy, CNN
updated 10:24 PM EST, Mon December 16, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Gunman's family offers prayers for surviving victim
Claire Davis is stable, but in a coma, her family says
The horse-loving senior "wouldn't hurt a fly," classmates say
Davis didn't know the student who shot her in the head, police say
(CNN) -- Friends of Claire Davis, the 17-year-old senior critically wounded in Friday's shooting at a Colorado high school, are wondering why bad things happen to good people.
Davis is in a struggle for her life at a hospital in Littleton, near Arapahoe High School, where a classmate shot her in the head.
She remained in critical condition Sunday.
"She is stable, but is in a coma. The first responders got Claire to the right place, at the right time, and the doctors and hospital staff are doing a wonderful job taking care of her," her family said in a statement.
"We appreciate your continued good thoughts and prayers, and will provide updates as her condition improves."
Among those praying for Davis is the family of Karl Pierson, the 18-year-old senior who police say shot her. In a statement released Monday afternoon, Barbara and Mark Pierson said Davis and her family "have suffered unimaginably, and we pray for her full recovery."
"As parents, we loved our son Karl dearly and we are devastated by what happened Friday. We cannot begin to understand why Karl did what he did," the Piersons said. They also offered prayers "for the entire Arapahoe High School community, as we know your lives are forever changed by this horrific event."
Claire Davis, a 17-year-old senior at Arapahoe High School, died Saturday, December 21, eight days after she was shot by a student with a shotgun at the school in Centennial, Colorado. "Despite the best efforts of our physicians and nursing staff, and Claire's fighting spirit, her injuries were too severe," Littleton Adventist Hospital said in a statement.
Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson holds a picture of Davis at a press conference on Saturday, December 14, after identifying her as the victim of the shooting at Arapahoe High School the day before. Robinson identified the shooter as 18-year-old Karl Halverson Pierson, who killed himself after opening fire. Pierson had asked about a specific teacher when he entered the school armed with a shotgun on December 13.

Lessons of Columbine and other school shootings helped in Arapahoe
Police say Pierson was looking for revenge against a librarian, but couldn't find the faculty member and killed himself as a school resource officer closed in. Davis was just a random victim, police surmised, and the gunman and victim didn't even know each other.
Davis' classmates spoke well of her. They used words like spunky and bright.
"She was just a very sweet girl. She's really smart," August Clary told CNN affiliate KUSA. He said Davis loves to ride horses and "wouldn't hurt a fly."
Hundreds of people attended a vigil for Davis on Saturday night.
Katie Snively, a senior at Arapahoe, said it was important to honor and pray for Claire.
Many people were tweeting to the hashtag #prayforclaire.
"Claire is a hero. our hero. she deserves to be rewarded not only with thanks, but with another chance at life," Aidan Loughran wrote.
"Thank God for waking us up again and for keeping Claire through the night. Don't forget to pray as we wake up this morning," Jonathon Bailey tweeted Sunday.
Davis' father told CNN affiliate KMGH late Saturday that his daughter is "not doing very well." The station said doctors are worried about swelling to her brain, according to a family friend.
