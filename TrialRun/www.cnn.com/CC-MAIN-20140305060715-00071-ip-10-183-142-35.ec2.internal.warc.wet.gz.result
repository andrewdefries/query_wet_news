Africans get upwardly mobile in cell phone boomStory Highlights Over past decade, Africa and Asia has witnessed cellphone revolution Seventy percent of new subscriptions came from poor countries since 2006 Cellphones enable emerging countries to "leapfrog" older technologies Additional mobile phones in population increases GDP, study findsNext Article in Technology » By Lara Farrar For CNN	LONDON (England) CNN -- One afternoon late in 2002, Mukhsin Alhassan Kadir drove his taxi from the busy streets of Accra, the capital of Ghana, to a nearby market community to meet a man who wanted to trade a plot of land for two cell phones. Ghanaian taxi driver Mukhsin Alhassan Kadir once traded two cell phones for a plot of land. When he arrived, Kadir collected the papers for the land and handed over what would be the first telephones this man and his wife had ever had in their lives. "During that time, everybody wanted to own a mobile phone, but it was not common to find them in this country," Kadir told CNN. In less than a decade, cellphones, once the preserve of the very rich, are now ubiquitous in Africa and parts of Asia. A device that's sometimes used as a fashion accessory in the West has become a lifeline for millions of people in the developing world. In Ghana, Kadir's phone functions as a portable office that he takes on the road with him during his taxicab shifts. "Sometimes I am in bed and a customer will call me and I will go and pick him up," said Kadir while driving a client down a highway on a recent morning in Accra. "It has helped my business a lot." "There is nobody in Ghana who is not using a mobile phone," added Kadir, speaking to CNN on a late model Sony Ericsson that he ordered for around $220 from someone in Italy. "Even a shoe shiner has his own mobile phone," he jokes. Numbers from the International Telecommunications Union indicate that since the end of 2006, nearly 70 percent of those subscriptions have come from developing countries. There are now almost seven million cellphone users in Ghana, up from only a couple hundred thousand subscribers in 2000. The continent's biggest users are in South Africa, with nearly 25 million subscribers, followed by Nigeria, Egypt and Morocco. However, the figures are startling in the lesser developed and poorer African countries. Don't Miss Just Imagine: 2020

A human-powered future?
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a population of 60 million, there are just 10,000 fixed telephones but more than a million cellphone subscribers. While in Chad, the fifth-least developed country in Africa, cellphone usage jumped from 10,000 to 200,000 in three years. "It truly is revolutionary," said Peter Gbedemah, CEO of the pan-African network service provider Gateway Communications. "Previously there were just simply no telephones or there would be a few phones around," "Now telephones are available for the masses, which is a relatively recent innovation in Africa." Today, roughly half of the world's population has a cellphone subscription and they are being used in a way economists say could dramatically reduce poverty and improve the quality of life for some of the world's poorest people. In the Philippines, the Grameen Village Phone Program enables very poor women to use microcredit to buy cell phones and sell the use of the phones to people living in their villages. Pelagia Garcia not only makes money by charging members of her community to use her cell phone but also adds extra income by renting out the use of a small antenna that improves cell phone reception. Garcia charges about 15 cents per use. A similar program also runs in Bangladesh and plans are underway for a similar scheme in Rwanda and Uganda. Doctors are now able to send their patients text messages to remind them to take medication and fishermen use phones to determine which market will offer them the best prices for their catch of the day. A lack of constant electricity has not stopped people using their cell phones either, rather a cottage industry of roadside vendors charging mobile phones with car batteries, has grown. More than a million people in Kenya now use their cell phones to complete simple financial transactions via a mobile-banking service launched by Vodafone last year. The company has started a similar enterprise in Tanzania, Afghanistan and India. "I think there is something quite fascinating going on here," Nick Hughes, head of international payment systems for Vodafone, told CNN. "If you give people the opportunity to connect and engage with the economy, they will do so." A lack of reliable, fixed-line telephone infrastructure is one of the main reasons why cellphones have experienced such exponential growth in emerging markets over the past few years, Gbedemah explained to CNN. The infrastructure, such as satellite receivers and cellphone towers, needed to support mobile technology is simply much easier and cheaper to install in developing countries than the more traditional networks common to the developed world. The installation of this new infrastructure is allowing people who live in these regions to "leapfrog" older generations of technology and in some ways become more technologically savvy than those living in the West, said Gbedemah. "Wireless technology is far more widely used in Africa than in Europe and the United States," Gbedemah told CNN. "Technological adoption has been much more rapid in Africa in the past five years than the past 20 or 30 years in Europe."

Tom DeLay's money laundering trial to begin By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe trial will take place in Texas capitalDeLay has pleaded not guilty Prosecutors allege he illegally sent money to help legislative candidates (CNN) -- Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday in the trial of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who is charged with illegally funneling corporate money to help elect GOP candidates to the Texas legislature. The Republican was indicted in 2005 on charges he illegally sent $190,000 in corporate money through the Republican National Committee to help elect GOP Texas legislative candidates in 2002. DeLay, who resigned in 2006, has pleaded not guilty to money laundering and conspiracy. He has said the trial will clear him. His attorney, Dick DeGuerin, told CNN in August that the case was "highly political" and should have been heard in DeLay's home county of Fort Bend. He said the case against his client began over congressional redistricting that gave Republicans control. DeGuerin had wanted the trial moved to another jurisdiction, arguing that "heavily Democratic" Travis County has a "strong anti-Tom DeLay feeling." But Senior Judge Pat Priest ruled in August that Delay will get a fair trial in Austin. "He's finally going to get a trial. He's literally been begging for five years," said DeGuerin, adding the evidence "will show he [DeLay] didn't do anything." Two other men facing charges in the case will be tried later. Over the summer, DeLay said a separate, long-running federal criminal investigation of him had been closed with no charges. The Justice Department declined comment on the federal investigation. DeLay was under investigation for his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who pleaded guilty in 2006 to fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy to bribe public officials. Abramoff admitted defrauding Native American tribal clients of millions of dollars for help in gaining casino licenses. DeLay said he had informed Abramoff that "our relationship is over" when he learned of Abramoff's plans for casinos aboard cruise ships. He also told reporters that during a visit to a casino on a Choctaw reservation he was disgusted when he saw a long line of baby carriages lined up while parents were gambling at 11:30 p.m.

Ashes of 'Star Trek' actor on private rocket
By John Zarella and Tom Cohen, CNN
updated 5:48 AM EDT, Fri May 25, 2012
Actor James Doohan celebrates getting a star on the Hollywood sidewalk in 2004 with his wife, Wende, and daughter Sarah.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
James Doohan played Scotty in the original "Star Trek" television series
His ashes are among those of 320 people in orbit on a rocket
The rocket eventually will burn up when it falls back into Earth's atmosphere
Some of Mercury 7 astronaut Gordon Cooper's ashes also are on board
(CNN) -- In the end, it was Scotty who got beamed up.
The ashes of late actor James Doohan, who played chief engineer Montgomery Scott in the original "Star Trek" television series and a series of subsequent films, were on the SpaceX rocket that launched a private spacecraft into orbit this week.
Doohan's character was referenced in the "Beam me up, Scotty" catchphrase associated with "Star Trek."
In various versions of the command, Capt. James T. Kirk, played by William Shatner, would ask his Scottish-descended colleague to activate a matter teleportation device that would transport Kirk or others to the starship Enterprise.
The SpaceX rocket lifts off Sunday, October 7, marking the first commercial flight to the International Space Station. It was the first of a dozen NASA-contracted flights to resupply the station.
People watch as the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and its unmanned Dragon capsule are readied for launch Sunday in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
On May 22, SpaceX launched a successful test flight that attached a spacecraft to the International Space Station. It was the first company to do so.
Dragon's recovery team poses in front of the first commercial capsule to reach orbit and return safely to Earth.
The Falcon 9 rocket launches on May 22 in Cape Canaveral.
This image shows how Dragon returns to Earth, under parachutes, to splashdown in the ocean, much like the spacecraft of Mercury, Gemini and Apollo.
The Falcon 9 rocket awaits May's launch date.
The first Dragon capsule to make it into orbit and return to Earth was launched in December 2010. Here, crews haul the charred capsule out of the ocean.

While it is unclear if the exact phrase "Beam me up, Scotty" ever was uttered in a "Star Trek" episode, it became a popular bumper sticker and Doohan chose it for the title of his autobiography published in 1996. He died in 2005.
Celestis, a company that provides memorial spaceflights, confirmed that some of Doohan's cremated remains were among 320 sets on the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched Tuesday.
Stellar week for SpaceX founder Elon Musk
In addition, a portion of the cremated remains of Mercury 7 astronaut Gordon Cooper also were on board, the company confirmed.
The Falcon 9 rocket, which carried up the SpaceX Dragon craft for a possible rendezvous this week with the International Space Station, is expected to remain in orbit for months until burning up when it falls back into the Earth's atmosphere.
"He would rather have flown when he was alive, of course," said Doohan's widow, Wende Doohan, who watched the SpaceX launch Tuesday with the couple's 12-year-old daugher, one of three children from a 31-year marriage.
Doohan always told her he wanted his ashes flown in space, she said Thursday, adding that the contract with Celestis was not signed until after Doohan died.
"He was this enormous fan of technology, future technology, space exploration, NASA and anything with mankind reaching out," Doohan said.
Doohan and Cooper's ashes also were launched in 2007, but that flight failed to make it into space.
My friend's ashes ride into space
Charles Chafer, the CEO of Celestis, said Thursday the remains aboard the Falcon 9 rocket came from 18 countries and included many people linked to the space industry, such as workers on the Apollo program.
According to Chafer, another celebrity whose remains were included was Randy VanWarmer, who wrote the song "Just When I Needed You Most." VanWarmer died of leukemia in 2004, Chafer said.
A common theme among those on board was their interest in traveling in space when alive, Chafer said, adding "but there's also a bunch of folks sort of new age; they wanted to be part of the universe."
In Doohan's case, timing led his acting career to the stars instead of the depths of the ocean, according to his widow. He read for parts on both "Star Trek" and "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea," and got a call back first from "Star Trek" producer Gene Roddenberry, she noted.
"No one would know him today if he'd gotten the other call first," she said.

Obama's Cabinet shaping up to be a boys club
By Halimah Abdullah, CNN
updated 7:42 AM EST, Thu January 10, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Obama's second term Cabinet picks include Jack Lew, Chuck Hagel and John Kerry
Some worry the trend will derail the president's previous track record of diversity
Defense and treasury Cabinet spots still a glass ceiling for women Washington (CNN) -- As Democrats in Congress celebrate a historic number of women elected to their ranks, the White House's top ranks reflect a very different picture -- one that is largely male.
CNN has learned President Barack Obama is expected to nominate White House chief of staff Jack Lew as treasury secretary.
The likely contenders to replace Lew -- including Ron Klain, who once served as Vice President Joe Biden's chief of staff, and Denis McDonough, a deputy national security adviser -- are all men.
Then there's the president's recent choice for defense secretary: former Sen. Chuck Hagel. The preferred choice to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state is another man: Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry.
The trend troubles those who study the role of women in government.

Vacancies at Cabinet table
"What you're hearing is that as new openings come up, there are missed opportunities to bring women in at that level," said Debbie Walsh, director of Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics, which tracks women in elective office.
"It is concerning at a time when you have a gender gap that put (Obama) over the top, and that gap was a diverse gender gap," Walsh said.
Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was believed to be the front-runner for Clinton's job but withdrew her name from consideration. She took heavy criticism from Republicans over her public statements about the deadly attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, in September.
Obama's Cabinet: Who's in, who's out?
Others candidates, such as Michele Flournoy, who served as undersecretary of defense, and Lael Brainard, an undersecretary at the Treasury Department, were bypassed in favor of Hagel and Lew, respectively.
Moreover, there are more men than women among names being considered for other Cabinet positions in Obama's second term.
The White House stresses a commitment to diversity and points to a number of women named to big jobs led by Clinton, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.
Solis on Wednesday resigned from her position and is expected to leave the department around Obama's inauguration later this month.
But the administration is looking for a woman to fill the commerce secretary position, two sources familiar with the nomination told CNN. Rebecca Blank is acting commerce secretary but is not expected to be the permanent choice.
How women ruled the 2012 election and where the GOP went wrong
The administration also says that more than half of the White House staff is made up of women, many in key senior leadership roles.
Contenders for Lew's job, the most powerful staff position in the administration, are both men.
Obama's two Supreme Court appointments so far have been women, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president speaks with a number of diverse candidates for various positions and selects who he thinks is the right person for the job.
"It's not uniform, it's a broad sentiment and he believes the country is served by a process that does seek out the diverse talent in this country for different positions," Carney said this week.
Labor Secretary Hilda Solis resigns
Obama has a stronger record so far in this area than his immediate predecessor, Bush.
Roughly 36% of Obama's Cabinet are women compared to 19% for Bush in his first term, according to the Women and Politics center at Rutgers.
While Obama's record on diversity is also better than the much-discussed 20% female representation in the Senate, he would have to appoint more women to match Bill Clinton's record. Women represented 41% of his Cabinet in his second term.
But diversity is more than numbers. It is also about ensuring that female candidates are being considered for a variety of positions, said Jennifer Lawless, director of Women & Politics Institute at American University.
"Nobody believes there's any overt discrimination," Lawless said pointing at women who occupy top posts in the Obama administration.
"Defense and Treasury: Those are male-dominated issues and frontiers, and those are the areas where woman still have to shore up their credentials and prove themselves more," Lawless said.
"We've reached a point in time where the Cabinets have become increasingly diverse. The next challenge is to make sure we're not pigeonholing women into those positions," she said.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
U.S. secretary of defense says predicting a North Korean test is difficult
Pyongyang says it plans a new nuclear test and further long-range rocket launches
It vows an "all-out action" against the United States, which it calls its "sworn enemy"
North Korea is upset by a recent U.N. Security Council resolution, an analyst says
Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea said Thursday that it plans to carry out a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches, all of which it said are a part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States.
The North's National Defense Commission said the moves would feed into an "upcoming all-out action" that would target the United States, "the sworn enemy of the Korean people."
Carried by the state media, the comments are the latest defiant flourish from the reclusive North Korean regime, whose young leader, Kim Jong Un, has upheld his father's policy of pursuing a military deterrent and shrugging off international pressure.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said Thursday there are no "outward indications" that North Korea is about to conduct a nuclear test, but he admitted it would be hard to determine that in advance.
"They have the capability, frankly, to conduct these tests in a way that makes it very difficult to determine whether or not they are doing it," he said in a Pentagon press conference.
"We are very concerned with North Korea's continuing provocative behavior," Panetta said, but he added that the United States is "fully prepared" to deal with any provocations.

North Korea's statement followed a U.N. Security Council resolution submitted by the United States and approved Tuesday that condemned a recent rocket launch by the North and expanded existing sanctions.
Pyongyang's threatening statement "should have been the expected outcome" from the U.N. decision, said Daniel Pinkston, senior analyst for the International Crisis Group covering Northeast Asia.
"I think they are completely outraged and insulted by it," he said.
North Korea's statement prompted France and Great Britain to express exasperation with the secretive regime.
Britain's mission to the United Nations called on North Korean leaders to "refrain from further provocation." France said it "deplores" North Korea's statement, telling its leaders that they need not to threaten, but instead to work toward dismantling their nuclear and missile programs.

In addition to Panetta's statement, the United States added sanctions against more North Korean bank officials and a business linked to the regime's nuclear weapons program.
The Treasury Department announcement targets two Beijing-based representatives of Tanchon Commercial Bank and a company -- Leader (Hong Kong) International Trading Limited -- that the U.S. government says shipped machinery and equipment in support of North Korea's nuclear program.
The organizations are "part of the web of banks, front companies and government agencies that support North Korea's continued proliferation activities," said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

"By continuing to expose these entities, and the individuals who assist them, we degrade North Korea's ability to use the international financial system for its illicit purposes," he said.
North Korea, which often issues bellicose statements in its state media, said Thursday that it rejects all Security Council resolutions concerning it, describing the most recent resolution as "the most dangerous phase of the hostile policy" toward it.

Analyst: Threat meant as a deterrence
The threats toward the United States, a constant theme in the North's propaganda, have more to do with deterrence than a desire for full conflict, Pinkston said.
"I don't believe they have the capability, the intention or the will to invade or destroy the United States," he said. "They wish to deter interference from the U.S. or any outside powers."
Read more: North Korea's rocket launches cost $1.3 billion
North Korea's successful rocket launch last month nonetheless changed the strategic calculations for the United States, showing that the North's missile program is advancing despite an array of heavy sanctions imposed on it.
Analysts say it still has a lot of work to do to master the technology necessary to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile or accurately target it.
At the same time, Pyongyang has been hinting for a while that a new nuclear test could be in the cards.

Just before the North sent out its latest hostile statement Thursday, a U.S. State Department official was telling reporters in Seoul that Washington hoped Pyongyang wouldn't go ahead.
"We think that that would be a mistake, obviously," said Glyn Davies, the U.S. special envoy on North Korea. "We call on North Korea, as does the entire international community, not to engage in any further provocations."
North Korea has carried out two previous nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, both of which were condemned by the United Nations.

Pyongyang didn't say Thursday when exactly it would carry out a third test, but it could happen "at any time," according to Pinkston.
He said it is hard for anybody outside the North Korean nuclear sector to know whether the country is technically ready to carry out the test, but that politically, "it seems an appropriate time."
Demands unlikely to sway North
South Korean defense officials said last year that they believed the North was in a position to carry out a new test whenever leaders in Pyongyang gave the green light.
North Korea's nuclear program is "an element of threat to peace not only for Northeast Asia but also for the world," Park Soo-jin, deputy spokeswoman for the South Korean Unification Ministry, said Thursday.
"North Korea should immediately stop its nuclear test and other provocation and should choose a different path by cooperating with the international community," Park said.
That appears unlikely at this stage, though.
After a failed long-range rocket launch in April, North Korea ignored international condemnation and carried out a second attempt last month. That one succeeded in putting a satellite in orbit, Pyongyang's stated objective.
But the launch was widely considered to be a test of ballistic missile technology. And it remains unclear whether the satellite, which the North insists is for peaceful purposes, is functional.
Both North Korea's previous nuclear tests took place weeks or months after long-range rocket launches.
Those tests were carried out under the rule Kim Jong Il, the deceased father of the current leader, and the man who channeled huge amounts of money into North Korea's nuclear and missile development programs.
Kim Jong Il died in December 2011 after 17 years in power, during which the North Korean people became increasingly impoverished and malnourished.
Economically, the country relies heavily on trade with its major ally, China.
China, which voted in favor of the U.N. Security Council resolution this week, appealed for calm on Thursday.
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei urged North Korea and the West to "keep calm, remain cautious and refrain from any action that might escalate the situation in the region."
The office of the South Korean president-elect, Park Geun-hye, said Friday that she would soon send a delegation to visit the United States.
"Issues of common interest will be discussed," said Yoon Chang-jung, a spokesman for Park, without specifying whether that included North Korea.

Source: 2011 slayings of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's friend, 2 others revisited

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Tamerlan Tsarnaev's friend and sparring partner was killed in 2011
The friend, Brendan Mess, and two others had their throats slit Source: The crime is being reviewed by "wider group of eyes"
(CNN) -- The slaying of one of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's best friends in September 2011 is now being reviewed by a "wider group of eyes,"a source close to the Boston bombing investigation tells CNN.
The killings of Brendan Mess and two others -- all of whom had their throats slit -- in Waltham, Massachusetts, remain unsolved. The Middlesex County district attorney's office said at the time that the three victims were killed by "sharp force injuries of the neck."
District Attorney Gerry Leone said days after the crime that the victims and two unknown perpetrators appeared to know each other and that it was not a random crime. No suspects were named or arrests made in the case.

Investigators of the crime reported at the time that the heads of the three victims were pulled back and their throats slit ear to ear with great force. Marijuana was spread over the bodies in a "symbolic gesture," and several thousand dollars in cash was found at the scene.
On Monday, Middlesex County District Attorney's spokeswoman Mary Beth Long told CNN, "We will review any new information that may come to light in (the triple homicide) as a result of the investigation into alleged marathon bombing suspect Tamarlen Tsarnaev."
Long said the case has always been an open investigation and that they continue to follow all leads.
A sister of one of the victims told CNN that she has been recently contacted by investigators in the case.
"She's meeting with them next week," said CNN's Ashleigh Banfield. "Investigators on that case are meeting with her and have been speaking with her since Saturday. Not only that, she confirms to me that the same detectives are still on that case and that they are detectives that she has spoken with in the past."

The sister, who requested to remain anonymous, said investigators have been very interested in trying to determine if there is any relationship between her brother and Tsarnaev, Banfield said.
"She couldn't really enlighten these detectives at all because she felt her brother wasn't a friend or acquaintance at all of Tamerlan Tsarnaev," Banfield said.
But the sister said she hopes the new interest will lead to her brother's case being solved.

updated 4:03 PM EDT, Thu August 22, 2013
Serena Williams is the defending women's champion at the U.S. Open while Rafael Nadal is the favorite in the men's draw. STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Novak Djokovic could meet Andy Murray in the semifinals at the U.S. Open Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal face a potential quarterfinal showdown in New York
Serena Williams begins against another grand slam winner, Francesca Schiavone Former winner Maria Sharapova pulled out of the tournament with a shoulder injury (CNN) -- They've met in three of the past four men's grand slam finals but after Thursday's draw, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic can't face each other on the last day of tennis' U.S. Open.
World No. 1 Djokovic and Murray, a winner in two of the last three majors he has played in, were placed in the same half of the draw while giants Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer could meet in the quarterfinals.
Murray ended Britain's 76-year wait for a men's singles winner at a grand slam and opened his own grand slam account when he toppled Djokovic in the 2012 final in New York.
Murray potentially must beat Djokovic and Nadal to repeat -- and he has never overcome the duo in the same fortnight at a major.
Nadal's recent surge -- he claimed back-to-back titles in Montreal and Cincinnati leading into New York -- and Murray's slump since capturing Wimbledon saw the Spaniard reclaim the No. 2 ranking.
Read: Nadal back to No. 2 As a result, Nadal and Djokovic couldn't be put in the same section.
Nadal wins 8th French Open title
Federer targets more grand slam titles
Maria Sharapova's taste for business
Williams celebrates her U.S. Open title
If the seedings hold, Nadal would battle not Murray but David Ferrer in the semifinals. Nadal owns a 20-4 record versus his countryman but has had it tougher against Murray, 13-5.
While 12-time grand slam champion Nadal and 17-time winner Federer have tangled in the finals at the three other majors, they have never faced off in any round at the U.S. Open.
Nadal downed Federer in three sets in the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Masters last week and is unbeaten on hard courts this season. Knee troubles ruled him out of Flushing Meadows in 2012.
At No. 7, Federer is at his lowest ranking in 11 years.
Williams, Azarenka lead women's field
In the women's draw, world No. 1 Serena Williams and No. 2 Victoria Azarenka appear to be on a collision course, especially since Maria Sharapova pulled out of the tournament due to a shoulder injury.
Azarenka has played in the past three hard-court grand slam finals, winning the Australian Open twice and losing a heartbreaker to Williams at the 2012 U.S. Open. She couldn't serve out the match.
Read: Williams wins New York thriller
Azarenka edged Williams in Cincinnati on Sunday in a third-set tiebreak.
In an intriguing first-round encounter, Williams begins against Francesca Schiavone. Although the Italian is slumping, she, too, is a grand slam champion and reached the U.S. Open quarterfinals three years ago.
