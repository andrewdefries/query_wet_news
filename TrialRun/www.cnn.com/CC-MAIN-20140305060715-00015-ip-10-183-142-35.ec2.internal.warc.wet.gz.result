DNA evidence key to student murderStory Highlights DNA results in case of murdered British student in Italy due for release this week Tests conducted on sneakers and computer of suspect, Raffaele Sollecito Another suspect, Rudy Hermann Guede, awaiting extradition in Italy Meredith Kercher, 21, killed at her villa in Perugia earlier this monthNext Article in World » Read VIDEO ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Italian investigators are awaiting the results of crucial DNA tests on evidence related to the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, as the latest suspect arrested in the case awaits his extradition to Italy. Rudy Hermann Guede was arrested in the German city of Mainz. A source in the Perugia prosecutor's office told CNN the results would likely be released on Thursday evening. The tests are being conducted on sneakers and a computer belonging to suspect Raffaele Sollecito, 23, who was in custody along with his girlfriend, Kercher's roommate, Amanda Knox, 20. Both are considered prime suspects in the killing of Kercher, 21, whose half-naked body was found with a stab wound to the neck earlier this month at her villa in Perugia, north of Rome. Kercher was an exchange student at the city's university. German police are holding another suspect, Rudy Hermann Guede, 20, who was arrested Tuesday near Mainz and is awaiting extradition to Italy. Congolese bar owner Patrick Lumumba, 38 -- who was arrested in Perugia along with Knox and Sollecito -- was released Tuesday after two weeks in custody. Forensics investigators are examining Sollecito's sneakers to determine if they are the ones that created a bloody footprint found at the crime scene, Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, told CNN. They are also examining Sollecito's computer. Sollecito has said he was at home the night that Kercher was killed. Maori said defense lawyers have examined a clone of Sollecito's hard drive that shows he was in his house and using the computer from 8:30 p.m. on Nov. 1 to 1:33 a.m. on Nov. 2. The timing is crucial because police have said Kercher died between 10 p.m. and midnight on Nov. 1. Maori said he is certain there is no blood on his client's shoes that would connect him to the crime scene. Don't Miss U.S. student detained over death

With Guede in Germany awaiting extradition -- a process that could take as long as two months -- police were searching his home in Perugia. Italian media reported that among the items police took were Guede's sneakers, which also will be checked to see if they match the footprint found in Kercher's room. A source in the Perugia prosecutor's office said police are re-examining surveillance camera footage taken the night of the murder showing a man in a laundromat washing his clothes and sneakers. The source said it was difficult to determine the man's identity. Guede was identified after police found a bloody fingerprint on a pillow at the crime scene. DNA tests have also linked Guede to a toilet at the villa Kercher shared with Knox and two Italians. E-mail to a friend From the Blogs: Controversy, commentary, and debate

'Redneck Woman' sings teacher's praises Story Highlights Country singer Gretchen Wilson earned her GED 20 years after quitting school Educator Bernadine Nelson helped Wilson along the way Wilson and Nelson promote the importance of adult education Wilson's achievement has inspired others to get their GED, Nelson said Next Article in Living » Read VIDEO LEBANON, Tennessee (CNN) -- A tumultuous home life forced country music star Gretchen Wilson to grow up quickly. Bernadine Nelson, left, and Gretchen Wilson want to raise awareness about the importance of adult education. "I was one of those kids that was brought up in kind of a crazy environment in the home, and I just thought I'd be better off if I could get out there and start doing it my way," said Wilson, 35. So at 15, she quit school and became a bartender in her Illinois hometown. From that point on, Wilson focused her attention solely on surviving and making music. In 1996, she moved to Nashville to pursue her dream of being a country music singer. Despite setbacks along the way, she found success in 2004 with the release of her first single, "Redneck Woman." "I had big dreams like most local musicians do, but the chances of this having happened for me were slim to none," said the Grammy Award winner. "Without [an] education, I'd have been pouring drinks for the rest of my life." Until earlier this year, Wilson was one of the millions of Americans who haven't finished their high school education. According to the U.S. Department of Education, 43 million people have dropped out of high school, and one in five Americans are functionally illiterate. Though she was a successful musician, Wilson said she became more determined than ever to finish her education. So, at age 34, she decided to get her GED -- and it was educator Bernadine Nelson who helped her. "I didn't have to go back and get my GED, but it was something I really needed to complete me as a person," Wilson said. Wilson reached out to the local adult education center in Lebanon, Tennessee, where she met Nelson, the center's director. Don't Miss Get involved: Adult Learning Center of Wilson County

In Depth: CNN Heroes
"[She] greeted me with a huge smile on her face and welcome arms," Wilson said. "She promised me above all that I'd be able to stand in that line and be proud of myself. She became an instant hero in my eyes." Nelson held true to her word. A year later, Wilson received her GED, crediting the achievement to Nelson's support and encouragement. Together, they're now raising awareness about the importance of an education and encouraging people to say, "I can do that too." Though she had been a teacher for decades, Nelson, 62, didn't realize the scope of under-education in America until she began working in adult education roughly six years ago. "It was an emotional thing to me because I kept thinking, 'What can I do? How can my little job help?' " Nelson said. "But I know it does, because every single person I've helped helps the big problem." Watch Wilson describe why Nelson is her hero » In addition to overseeing the center, Nelson has become an outspoken advocate for adult education in Tennessee, speaking to community groups and holding a weekly guest spot on a local radio show. She believes the benefits of an education are priceless. "Having a GED or high school diploma gives you more self-esteem and a better opportunity for a better job," Nelson said. Since 2002, Nelson has helped more than 1,050 students receive their GEDs. And she said she knows that many others will follow in Wilson's footsteps. "Gretchen came to the program because she wanted to fulfill this void that had been missing for all these years for her," Nelson said. "I don't think she realized how much this would speak to other people. Her fans are legion. If their role model, the Redneck Woman, could get her GED, then ... maybe they could too." Since Wilson received her GED in May 2008, Nelson said, several people have already called her, citing the singer's achievement as inspiration for obtaining theirs. For Wilson, Nelson's dedication to bringing the importance of education to the forefront of people's lives is making a difference. "She's bound and determined to put that sense of pride back into these people who felt that they've lost it," Wilson said. "That's not only respectable, it's admirable."

Greene: After debate civility, back to the low road?Story Highlights Did civility onstage before and after VP debate signal a shift in the campaign? Most voters interviewed on the road say they would like to see less negativity Political professionals appear to believe the low road is the path to victory One voter says politicians wouldn't take that path if public didn't watch it Next Article in Politics » Read VIDEO By Bob Greene CNN contributor	Editor's note: Award-winning writer Bob Greene is riding CNN's Election Express across the country in the final weeks before the election to tell stories about how the issues affect Americans. After Thursday's debate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Sen. Joe Biden and their families mingled on stage. ABOARD THE CNN ELECTION EXPRESS (CNN) -- On the surface, at least, the civility at Thursday's vice presidential debate started the moment Joe Biden and Sarah Palin warmly greeted each other on the stage at the outset. The cordiality lingered -- you could see it in the apparently friendly conversations between the candidates, and between the candidates' families, after the debate was over. Policy differences aside, here in St. Louis, Missouri, all feelings were good feelings, if you believed what you were seeing. And the question becomes, as the presidential campaign moves on today: Does this signal an end to the escalating campaign nastiness the country has observed in recent weeks? Will the attack ads stop, will the ruthless thrusts by the opposing organizations come to an end? You already know the answer. If past is prologue, the meanest days on the path to the presidency lie ahead. But on our journey through the United States, we have stopped many times to ask the men and women we meet: If you had a "delete" button available to you, and could push it and instantly get rid of one aspect of the campaign, what would it be? Don't Miss Greene: If you could ask one question
Greene: Tell candidates that election is no game
Election Center 2008
Some people, probably predictably, said: "Obama." Some people, just as predictably, said: "McCain." But the most frequent answer -- the one we began to anticipate even as we asked the question -- was some version of: It would be so nice if the campaigns would get rid of the dirty stuff; would do away with the name-calling and ugly whispers. "The attack ads," said Barbara Davis, of Southaven, Mississippi. "All those negative ads where the candidates go after each other. If I could push a button and make all of that disappear, I would. It would be so much better if they would just talk to us about the issues." The history of campaigns tells us the high road can be a lonely place; that is not where victory resides. Or so the political professionals appear to believe. But the voters say they don't accept this notion. "The gossip is what I can't stand," said April Leek, 33, with whom we spoke in Guernsey County, Ohio. "I don't need to hear about the personal business in the candidates' lives, or in the lives of their families. These are government officials, not movie stars, but we can't seem to tell the difference anymore. I think other countries watch how we conduct our presidential campaigns, and they must laugh at us." Time after time, before we could even finish asking the question about the "delete" button, people gave us their almost unvarying answers. "The dirt," said Tom Murphy, 67, of Long Island, New York. "Get rid of the dirt. Talk to us about something of substance. We've had enough of this nonsense. Treat the voters with a little respect." The campaigns must hear the same things we do -- and reject it. "I can't stand the mudslinging," said Kelly Britland, 31, of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. "All those commercials are really saying, in different words, is: 'This guy's bad.' It's like talking trash to someone. It's not saying why people should vote for the candidate who's paying for the ad. It's just calling the other candidate names." Why does she think the low road remains so congested? "On some level, it must work," she said. "The commercials must change people's minds about the candidates, or the campaigns wouldn't always spend money on them." Things truly did seem stylistically pleasant on the stage at Washington University in St. Louis Thursday night. The manner in which Biden and Palin treated each other, at least in ways a world watching on television could see, gave hope that the collegial tone might extend all the way to election night November 4. Right. "Don't blame the candidates for it," said Brad Webb, 65, of Anderson, South Carolina. "And don't blame the media. Blame us. The public." Blame the public? Blame the voters? Why? "Because candidates wouldn't give this to us if they thought we really didn't want to see it," he said. "It's our fault for watching. You know the way people stop on the highway to stare at a bad accident, even though they feel bad for doing it? That's us, with the negative campaigning. We always stop to look. If we didn't, they wouldn't keep giving us something to look at."

Bolt: I want to be a legend Story Highlights Usain Bolt tells CNN that he wants to go down as a track and field legend Jamaica superstar emulated his Olympic triumph with three golds in Berlin Bolt reveals he may turn his attentions to longer 400m event at next worldsNext Article in World Sport » Read VIDEO BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- After bagging three gold medals and setting two world records at the Berlin world championships, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt told CNN he didn't expect to be so successful. Bolt received a commemorative slab of the Berlin Wall as he celebrated his world championship success. "I didn't see this coming," Bolt told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. "I guess it's competition. I keep telling people competition is good for the sport. I had to be at my best, and I was at my best." During the championships, Bolt smashed his own 100 meter world record with a time of 9.58 seconds. In the 200 meters, Bolt took gold in a phenomenal 19.19 seconds, shaving just a tenth of a second off the mark he set in winning the competition at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing. He also nabbed a third gold in the 4 x 100 meter relay on the penultimate day of the championships on Saturday, running the third leg for Jamaica. "My secret's just hard work and dedication," Bolt told CNN. "I'm really dedicated to being a champion. I want to be a legend, so I have to work really hard." Bolt told a cheering crowd at a news conference in the German capital, "I will never forget being here." He told CNN he has been training for this ever since 2007, when he suffered defeat at the Osaka world championships. He and his coach analyzed that performance, and he went back and worked on some aspects of his sprinting, he told CNN. How much faster can he go? "I don't know," Bolt, who celebrated his 23rd birthday on Friday, told CNN. Don't Miss Bolt smashes 200m record to claim gold Richards finally secures 400m gold
Legend Bekele claims fourth gold
Bolt wins world title in new record "I have no clue. Right now, I'm just happy I got the gold medals." He said he is grateful for remaining injury-free, as well. Among the honors Bolt received was a large piece of the Berlin Wall. He told reporters he was honored, but wasn't sure how he was going to transport it home to Jamaica. Asked whether he expected such success, Bolt told CNN, "I was hoping. I was definitely hoping, but I wasn't sure what was going to happen here." Joined at a news conference organized by the Jamaica Tourist Board along with other athletes and Jamaican officials, Bolt invited the crowd to come to Jamaica. He said he plans to return to the island and explore it during his down time. "Come and see the places which I'm going to see ... it's a beautiful country," he said. Bolt told reporters his coach won't let him get complacent. "I know what it takes to stay on top, and that's the aim. I told you guys, I want to be a legend, and I can't be complacent if I want to be a legend." He said he definitely plans to return for the 2011 global championships in Daegu, South Korea and gave a strong hint he intends to seriously tackle the longer 400m race to add to his triumphs over 100 and 200m.

United Arab Emirates vastly increases voting eligibility By the CNN Wire Staff U.A.E. Minister of State for FNC Affairs, Anwar Mohammed Gargash, is pictured in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on September 06, 2010.

Elections and Voting
(CNN) -- The United Arab Emirates has announced a huge increase in the number of people who will take part in an upcoming election to choose the members of its advisory legislative body. Almost 130,000 people will be eligible to vote for the Federal National Council (FNC) this year, officials said. In the last election in 2006, only about 6,500 people were allowed to vote. Minister of State for Federal National Council Affairs Anwar Mohammed Gargash said the change shows the UAE's commitment to developing political participation "in tune with the local culture," according to state-run news agency WAM. The decision comes as movements calling for greater political participation and democracy have swept through the region. While widespread street protests like those in numerous other Arab nations have not been reported in the UAE, authorities in the country are sensitive to growing calls for reform in the Middle East and North Africa. The FNC has 40 members. Half are chosen by the electoral college -- the groups of people who are allowed to vote -- and the other half are nominated by the rulers of each of the seven emirates. The CIA World Factbook describes the UAE as a "federation with specified powers delegated to the UAE federal government and other powers reserved to member emirates." It describes the FNC as the country's legislative branch, noting that the body "reviews legislation but cannot change or veto."Journalist Jennifer Fenton contributed to this report.

Fed-up officer says 'enough,' starts senior outreach
By Danielle Berger, CNN
updated 8:01 AM EDT, Fri July 6, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Police officer Zach Hudson often saw senior citizens vulnerable and victimized
He formed a group of volunteers in Florida to reach out to seniors and help
The house calls provide specialized service that police, fire departments usually can't
Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes
Lake Mary, Florida (CNN) -- Shortly after joining the Lake Mary Police Department in 2007, Zach Hudson was dispatched to the home of two elderly women.
What he saw left him appalled.
The two women -- a mother in her 90s and a daughter in her 70s -- had no food and no electricity. Each month, they alternated what they spent their small amount of money on: One month it would be medicine, the next it would be food and bills.
"They were struggling horrifically," Hudson recalled. "They had to cut their medications. They were doing the things that seniors often do to try to make up the financial difference."
In his 10 years as a Florida police officer, Hudson had witnessed countless senior citizens in tragic circumstances. But this was the last straw for him.
"I'd had enough," he said. "And I realized that something had to be done. And that's when I started to conceptualize the Seniors Intervention Group."
Since 2009, Hudson's group has tended to the basic needs of nearly 1,000 seniors in Seminole County, Florida. With the help of hundreds of local volunteers, seniors are provided with essential assistance such as food, money, transportation, vehicle maintenance and help around the house.
Zach Hudson was raised in a senior community by his grandparents and great-grandmother.
"If you're 80 years old and you have to get up on a footstool to change your light bulb and you fall, it could kill you," said Hudson, 40. "When it's 100 degrees outside and you're faced with either doing your yard or being fined, and you can't pay somebody to do it, what do you do? Well, you get out there and do it and suck it up, right?
"But sucking it up killed this (one) gentleman. A very kind elderly man walked outside to do his yard, and he didn't survive. And that's happening all the time."
Hudson said seniors facing diminished income in a difficult economy often have to make life-and-death choices for where and how to spend their money. For example, a light bulb that illuminates a doorway -- or a repair to a front door -- might easily fall below food and medicine on a senior's list of priorities and make them more vulnerable to crime.
If a licensed worker is out of a senior's financial reach, they might be willing to pay cash to a stranger who knocks on their door offering to clean their yard or perform basic services. Too often, Hudson says, these strangers are not who they say they are.
"As cops and firefighters, we see people at their worst. That's just the way it is," Hudson said. "And when you see seniors on a regular basis ... and they're constantly being scammed or victimized ... you start to ask yourself: 'Why? What can we do? I'm tired of walking away from this elderly person's house every day and not being able to fix the problem.' ...
"If you have a crime, then (police) can handle it. If you have a fire, the fire department can handle it. But what do you do when somebody can't pay their electric bill and, as a result, that won't run their oxygen pump? How do you deal with that?"
They're constantly being scammed or victimized ... you start to ask yourself: 'Why? What can we do?'CNN Hero Zach Hudson
Forming the Seniors Intervention Group was a natural offshoot of Hudson's job as community relations officer for his department. The group became a nonprofit in early 2010, and it expanded to include the entire county this year.
By partnering with faith-based organizations, local businesses and other nonprofits, the group can call upon hundreds of volunteers to make house calls. Seniors are either referred by local first responders or reach out for help directly. Assistance could be as minor as retrieving a pill that has fallen behind a piece of heavy furniture or as major as rebuilding a senior's home. All of the group's services are free and covered by private donations.
About once every month, the group schedules a large "operation" in which dozens of volunteers descend upon a local neighborhood to do massive group service, such as yard cleanup or a sweeping installation of energy-efficient lighting. Hudson says this is often a great way to identify individuals who need more help.
"That operation ... always leads to finding other things, whether it's floor issues, window issues, (air conditioning) issues, whatever the case might be," he said. "It's a neat opportunity for us to get on the ground, take a good look around and see how else we can help."

Hudson's dedication to public safety might not be unique among police officers, but his compassion for seniors is rooted in a more intimate history. He was raised primarily by his grandparents and great-grandmother in a senior community.
"Elderly people rescued me in a lot of ways," he said. "They taught me respect. They taught me so many things. And this is simply an opportunity for me to give back to them in their time of need, because that time is here and it's now."
And it's something that is only going to get worse over the next 20 years, according to the Pew Research Center. Each day in the United States, about 10,000 Americans turn 65. By 2030, when all baby boomers will have passed the milestone, 18% of the nation's population will be at least that age, Pew projects.
"We need more organizations, more businesses, more churches, more police departments, more fire departments to get on board, see the big picture, see the problem," said Hudson, who hopes to see his nonprofit model replicated nationwide. "This is just the beginning."
For seniors like Ralph Anderson, the group's efforts have been life-changing.
The Vietnam veteran had worn a hole in his bathroom floor with his wheelchair, leaving him vulnerable to an accident. It was also difficult for Anderson to leave his home, so he had to often rely on other people to walk his dogs.
But he was introduced to Hudson's group last month, and volunteers have since replaced and tiled his bathroom floor, fixed his leaky kitchen faucet and installed a wheelchair ramp at the front entrance of his home.
"It means the difference between feeling like I'm a burden on someone and being able to do something for myself," Anderson said. "Since they're putting this little ramp (in), I can take the dogs out to walk them. I don't have to wait for someone to come help me."
Hudson says that helping Anderson and other seniors is a pleasure and a privilege.
"(This) is an opportunity for me to embrace the very people that embraced me growing up. ... This is my chance to take care of them as they have taken care of me."

'Barbaric' whipping of horse in Pistorius race
By Tom McGowan, CNN
updated 9:22 AM EST, Fri December 14, 2012
South Africa's Oscar Pistorius, a six-time Paralympic gold medal winner, raced an Arab horse on Wednesday.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Animal rights organizations criticize "barbaric" whipping of horse which raced against Oscar Pistorius
Double amputee Pistorius, a six-time Paralympic gold medalist, beat an Arab horse on Wednesday
World Horse Welfare describe jockey's use of the whip as "completely unnecessary"
The use of the whip is horse racing has been cause of much controversy in Britain
(CNN) -- Animal welfare groups have criticized the "utterly barbaric" whipping of a horse which competed in a race against Paralympic icon Oscar Pistorius.
The South African double amputee, who made history by competing in the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, beat an Arab horse in a race in Doha, Qatar on Wednesday -- as part of a campaign highlighting contributions made by people with disabilities.
World Horse Welfare, a body which advises on rules for international equestrian competitions, branded the treatment of the horse, which started the race 15 meters behind Pistorius, as a "disgrace".
"World Horse Welfare are appalled at the way the jockey used the whip which was not only completely unnecessary but utterly barbaric," the organization told CNN.
South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius, the first amputee to compete in the Olympic Games, will race a horse in Qatar on Wednesday. The one-off event is to show case the contributions made by disabled people.
Pistorius demonstrates his sprinting skills to London Olympic chief Sebastian Coe at an event to launch the 2012 Paralympic Games.
Pistorius claimed gold for the first time at the 2004 Athens Paralympics in the final of the men's 200m, setting a new world record.

Pistorius held off Jerome Singleton of the United States to win gold over 100m in the T44 class at the 2008 Beijing Paralympics. He also won the 200 and 400m events in the Chinese capital.
Pistorius was honored at the 2012 Laureus World Sport Awards for his achievements and services to disabled sport.
Pistorius competed in the semifinals of the able-bodied men's 400m at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu in South Korea. Pistorius with one of his sporting heroes, Namibian sprint star Frankie Fredericks, and South African rugby player Bryan Habana, right.
Pistorius helped South Africa to the final of the 4x400m at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, but was left out of the quartet which won silver. Having run in the heats, he was still awarded a medal, becoming the first disabled athlete to achieve that feat. Horse power

'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius
Paralympian superstar Oscar Pistorius
Read: Pistorius to race a horse "Excessive whip use like this is a disgrace to racing as a sport. We applaud the achievements of Oscar Pistorius and his race could have been a great spectacle, but instead it was marred by the flagrant abuse of this horse."
Prior to the race against Pistorius, World Horse Welfare had said it had no problem with the horse competing providing it was treated fairly.
"We commented on the race beforehand to say we didn't see any immediate welfare concerns providing the horse was treated well. Clearly it wasn't," said the body's deputy chief executive Tony Tyler.
In a statement to CNN, six-time Paralympic gold medalist Pistorius -- who also reached the semifinals of the Olympic 400 meters competition -- said he was unaware of any ill treatment to the horse.
"I participated in the race in good faith as it was to promote abilities across sport and I was totally unaware of any alleged excessive force being used on the horse," said the 26-year-old.
"I don't condone any ill-treatment of animals and would always hope that a horse would be ridden in the correct way. Those who know me well are very aware of my well-publicized care and love of animals."
The organizers of the race were not immediately available for comment.
The use of the whip in horse racing has been a source of controversy in recent years, notably in Britain.
Regulator British Horseracing Association completed a 10-month review of whip regulations in November 2011, recommending its use be regulated, with bans issued for excessive use.
Penalties, which can include losing prize money, become more severe depending on the number of times a jockey breaches regulations.

Would a President Petraeus be in the cards?
By William Doyle, Special to CNN
updated 10:27 AM EDT, Thu March 28, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
David Petraeus has apologized for his extramarital affair since resigning from the CIA
William Doyle: Petraeus is superbly poised for a major comeback He says Americans will give public figures a second chance when the apology is sincere
Doyle: Other than public service (for now), Petraeus can do anything
Editor's note: William Doyle is author of "A Soldier's Dream: Captain Travis Patriquin and the Awakening of Iraq" (Penguin) and co-author of "A Mission from God: A Memoir and Challenge for America" (Simon & Schuster).
(CNN) -- David Petraeus, who has wandered for months in his own private wilderness, is superbly poised for a major comeback.
Why? Because he has apologized, and it appears that he means it. Americans like that.
Compared with some other American public figures toppled by scandal, Petraeus is coming back the right way.

Unlike Richard Nixon after Watergate, Petraeus has offered a clear, sincere sounding public apology. Nixon squirmed and sweated and prevaricated for years after he hurled himself out of the White House, but he could never find in himself enough manhood and public relations common sense to declare the simple words that might have saved his presidency in the first place: "I made some major mistakes, I acknowledge them unreservedly, and I ask the nation to consider forgiving me."
Similarly, a John Edwards comeback was never going to happen. Not only did he get tangled up with another woman while his wife was dying of cancer, he denied it, and then a "love child" appeared in the tabloids, as did a chatty mistress. Then Edwards offered TV quasi-apologies so weird and painful to watch that America decided just to switch him off permanently, shaking him off like a bad dream.
In contrast, Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter's career seemed doomed by a call-girl scandal in 2007, until he held a press conference, took responsibility for his actions and asked for forgiveness. Result: He was re-elected in 2010, and is now considered a front-runner for the Louisiana Republican gubernatorial race in 2015.

Other polarizing figures have come back from messy, highly chaotic personal lives, like Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani. It ain't easy.
Marks: Petraeus to 'get right' with Army
Petraeus launches 'apology tour'
When I interviewed Petraeus for my book about the Iraq War a few years ago, I held a healthy dose of skepticism about his reputation as the man who turned the war around with the "surge." I felt that momentum for a turnaround had already developed before Petraeus got back to Iraq in early 2007, thanks in part to the Iraqi Awakening movement of 2006 and its American supporters, largely fairly junior U.S. military officers in Anbar Province, like Capt. Travis Patriquin and his colleagues.
The funny thing was, Petraeus told me he thought pretty much the same thing himself. That impressed me. Either he is a self-aware man with a dose of humility or a shrewd manipulator of his audience. Either trait will serve him well.
I doubt we'll see Petraeus in a straight government job anytime soon. The circumstances of his CIA departure were just too messy. But other than public service, the world is his oyster, thanks to the towering reputation he had before the scandal.
Petraeus might even run for office someday. Given his intelligence and communication skills, and the often wretched choices voters are presented with, he might even have a shot. After that, would a President Petraeus be in the cards? A real long shot. But don't laugh too hard. Stranger things have happened.
For now, though, he is well-positioned to become a highly sought-after TV pundit, corporate board member, Silicon Valley partner, you name it.
He might write a big book about his career and military insights. He'll be courted by Hollywood and the press. In the right Hollywood hands, his book might even make a hell of a good movie. He will give big speeches on the national security issues of the day, and might even advise a president or two again someday.
Americans seem to have limited patience for public figures who lie, cheat, steal or make spectacles that make everyone look silly.
But when people foul up in a spectacular fashion, especially when it involves a personal matter, Americans will give them a break and a second chance -- as long as they stand up like a man or a woman, admit they screwed up, say they're sorry and look like they damn well mean it.
Welcome back, Gen. Petraeus.

Source: Mental health paperwork found at home of Miriam Carey after Capitol chase
By Michael Pearson. Lateef Mungin and Deborah Feyerick, CNN
updated 10:09 PM EDT, Fri October 4, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: "We want to know if protocols were followed," the Carey family attorney says
The papers listed prescriptions to treat schizophrenia and other disorders, the source says
Miriam Carey's boyfriend told police she seemed delusional, a source tells CNN
She died Thursday after a car chase with police near the Capitol
Watch an exclusive interview with Miriam Carey's sisters on AC360 tonight, 8pm ET.
Washington (CNN) -- Authorities searching the home of a Connecticut woman who rammed barricades and led police on a chase near the U.S. Capitol found discharge papers from a 2012 mental health evaluation that listed prescriptions to treat schizophrenia and other mental disorders, a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation said Friday.
The woman, identified by law enforcement sources as Miriam Carey, 34, died after police shot her.
Earlier, sources said investigators found medications, but that proved later not to be accurate.
Carey's boyfriend told police in December that she appeared to be delusional, believing that President Barack Obama had placed Stamford, Connecticut, where they lived, under lockdown and that her home was under electronic surveillance, a law enforcement source involved in the investigation said.
Thursday's incident played out in one of the most heavily policed places in the world, temporarily locked down Congress and sparked anxiety among tourists and staffers alike.
Police say Carey rammed barricades and police cruisers -- actions Washington police Chief Cathy Lanier said appeared deliberate -- and sped down Pennsylvania Avenue before crashing. Two law enforcement officers were injured, and officers shot her to end the incident.
The Carey family is questioning whether shooting her was the only way to end the chase.
"We want to know if protocols were followed," family attorney Eric Sanders said on CNN's AC360.
Carey apparently did not have a weapon, but did have a 1-year-old girl in the car with her. The child -- Carey's daughter -- survived the chaos unharmed, officials said.

Incredible video of D.C. car chase
Woman killed in D.C. chase identified
The child has been taken into protective custody by the D.C. Child and Family Services Agency. She has been temporarily placed with a foster family, according an agency spokesperson.
Carey's family has identified the woman's body, said Beverly Fields, a spokeswoman for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.
Why a new mom might put herself -- and her child -- in harm's way
Authorities who searched Carey's apartment in Stamford found discharge papers that listed risperidone, a medication to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, a law enforcement source said. They also found paperwork listing escitalopram, an antidepressant commonly prescribed under the brand name Lexapro, according to the source.
It was not known if she was taking any of the medications, and authorities have not officially linked the incident to mental illness or any other factor.
According to Xavier Amador, a psychologist and expert in schizophrenia and other mental health disorders, it is possible the medications were prescribed for postpartum psychosis, a rare illness that usually comes on suddenly within the first four weeks after birth.
A few months after her daughter was born, Miriam Carey was diagnosed with postpartum depression with psychosis, her sister, Amy Carey-Jones, said on CNN's "AC360."
"There wasn't a pattern. It was something that occurred suddenly," Carey-Jones said. "She seemed overwhelmed. There was a lot of stress.
"There was not moments of her walking around with delusions. That was not what was going on."
Her sister made progress with the help of counseling and medications. Carey-Jones said her sister recently told her that the doctors said she didn't need the medication anymore.
"They tapered her off the medications, and she said she felt fine," Carey-Jones said.
She declined to discuss what medication her sister had taken.
Carey's boyfriend contacted police last winter, when their child was four months old, according to the law enforcement source who told CNN about the boyfriend's reports to police.
He told police that she was suffering from post-partum depression, was having trouble sleeping and was on medication. Carey underwent a mental health evaluation, said the source, who added that the boyfriend has been questioned by federal authorities about Thursday's events.
The source told CNN that Carey left a letter addressed to the boyfriend at her apartment and that it appeared to contain white powder. The letter was being tested for hazardous substances.
A car chase, gunshots
Thursday's drama began around 2 p.m., when the woman steered a black Infiniti near the White House, a U.S. Secret Service source said. She drove up to a barrier at the 15th and E street checkpoint and was approached by Secret Service officers. She hurriedly made an erratic three-point turn, striking the barrier and backing into an officer before driving away, the source told CNN.
Police said the car sped down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol, where security vehicles stopped it at Garfield Circle.
The woman slammed the car into reverse, crashing into a police cruiser, and tried to get away. At that point officers began firing, a witness said.

Track car chase that ended near Capitol
The shooting during the shutdown
Dramatic video footage by a videographer for Alhurra TV, a Middle Eastern news outlet financed by the U.S. government, showed the black vehicle then speeding around a nearby traffic circle with a police car in close pursuit and then heading away. The car crashed into more security barriers a few blocks later, witnesses said.
More shots were fired after the vehicle stopped, and the woman was hit several times, said Metropolitan Police Department Chief Cathy Lanier. Carey was later pronounced dead, Lanier said. Two officers were injured.
A Capitol Police officer whose vehicle crashed during the chase was hurt, authorities said. The officer was released from a hospital Thursday night. The Secret Service did not release information about its injured agent.
Chaos and a child in the car
Inside the woman's car was the 1-year-old child, who was not harmed. The child was taken into protective custody, officials said. Officers didn't know there was a child inside the woman's car during the chase, officials said. Also, the early investigation revealed that there was no evidence that the woman had a gun or fired a shot.
The bedlam from the fatal chase reverberated throughout a U.S. Capital already shaken by the recent mass shooting at the Navy Yard in the city and on edge due to tensions over the showdown over shutting down the federal government.
Authorities locked down the Capitol building and other government facilities in the area.
House and Senate sessions were immediately suspended, with legislators ordered to take cover and keep away from windows. Police also closed Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House.
Sirens blared as people in and around government office buildings reported hearing gunshots. Bystanders hid in fear.
Shemaiah Ofori-Attah and her husband, Edmund, at first thought the speeding black car and sirens were part of a motorcade.
"Then when we heard the gunshots we knew this was something serious, so we just dropped to the ground," she said.
Danny Farkas, the Alhurra videographer, captured the scene. He said he had a fleeting thought that perhaps the driver had explosives in the car.
"I was surprised at the movie-like quality of what was going on in front of me," he told CNN's "New Day."
