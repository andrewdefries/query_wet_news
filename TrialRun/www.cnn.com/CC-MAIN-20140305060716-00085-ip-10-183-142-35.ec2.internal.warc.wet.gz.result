(CNN) -- President Bush and other officials Monday intensified their defense of a domestic surveillance program that supporters say protects against terrorism and critics say threatens civil liberties.The president told an audience at Kansas State University in Manhattan that the congressional resolution passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks that authorized the invasion of Afghanistan and other counterterrorism measures gave him the legal authority to initiate the program. Bush also said he kept key members of Congress informed."You know, it's amazing that people say to me, 'Well, he was just breaking the law.' If I wanted to break the law, why was I briefing Congress?" Bush said, apparently referring to former Vice President Al Gore's accusation last week that he was "breaking the law" by authorizing the program. (Full story)"These are not phone calls within the United States," Bush said. "This is a phone call of an al Qaeda, known al Qaeda suspect, making a phone call into the United States. "I'm mindful of your civil liberties, and so I had all kinds of lawyers review the process. We briefed members of the United States Congress ... about this program."Bush reportedly authorized the National Security Agency to intercept communications between people inside the United States, including American citizens, and terrorist suspects overseas without obtaining a court warrant.Some critics call the program illegal, contending it threatens civil liberties and privacy rights.The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed lawsuits last week against the government to stop the program. ( Full story)Bush wasn't the only official to stand by the program Monday. In Washington, Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden, the former NSA chief when Bush first authorized the surveillance program after September 11, 2001, staunchly came to its defense."Had this program been in effect prior to 9/11, it is my professional judgment that we would have detected some of the 9/11 al Qaeda operatives in the United States, and we would have identified them as such," said Hayden, who now is principal deputy director of national intelligence.Addressing privacy concerns prompted by the program, Hayden said, "We know we can only do our job if we have the trust of the American people."The general said, "We're going after very specific communications that our professional judgment tells us we have reason to believe are those associated with people who want to kill Americans." He said he called a meeting in October 2001 shortly after the program was authorized and told key members of the NSA work force "what we're going to do and why. I also told them that we're going to carry out this program and not go one step further." The general said three NSA attorneys provided independent opinions that the program was legal. "The agency does everything with a lawyer looking over their shoulders," Hayden said.He said the program targets intercepted communication initiated or terminated in a foreign country. Judgments of what communication is deemed to be directly tied to al Qaeda is made by NSA professionals, according to Hayden.Any intercepts of conversations unrelated to the NSA's mission "would be destroyed and not reported," Hayden said. Bush and Hayden are among a string of high-level administration officials set to make public appearances about the program this week, culminating with the president's visit Wednesday to NSA headquarters outside Washington.Role in 'preventing attacks' citedThe White House's renewed defense of the program began Monday morning as spokesman Dan Bartlett told CNN it has "directly played a role in preventing attacks on our homeland" and protections are in place to prevent its abuse. "There are multiple checks and balances to make sure what we're doing is targeting ... international phone calls of terrorists, not the conversations between two families coordinating a family vacation," Bartlett said. "We have very strict laws, very strict oversight. This is a targeted program, and I think most of the American people would be very angry if they thought we weren't doing just this."Critics have questioned that legal rationale, pointing to a law passed by Congress in the 1970s requiring executive branch agencies to get approval for domestic surveillance requests from a special court, whose proceedings are secret to protect national security.They point out the administration could accomplish the same goals legally by taking requests for warrants before the court under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- and doing so as long as 72 hours after the wiretaps were begun in cases where time is of the essence."I don't think that anyone can make the claim that the FISA statute is optimized to deal with or prevent a 9/11, or to deal with a lethal enemy who likely already had combatants inside the United States," Hayden said. "We go down this path because our operational judgment ... is much more effective, so we do it for that reason," he said. Nevertheless, Hayden said that FISA has been a "remarkably successful tool." But Hayden said the NSA program allows faster movement than is possible under FISA. "NSA cannot, under the FISA statute, put someone on coverage and go ahead and play for 72 hours while it gets a note saying it's OK," he said. "The attorney general approves the emergency FISA coverage, and the attorney general's standard is a body of evidence equal to that which we would present to the court."On Tuesday, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is to speak publicly on the surveillance program. He's also set to appear next month before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing investigating the program.It would be impossible to monitor all international calls made by Americans, Hayden said, noting that in 2003 such calls represented 200 billion minutes. Asked whether al Qaeda operatives must assume their communications are monitored, Hayden replied, "They don't always act like they know they're being monitored." Sen. John Kerry on Sunday said the country is "prepared to eavesdrop wherever and whenever necessary in order to make America safer. But we put a procedure in place to protect the constitutional rights of Americans."If the current system -- in which a special court can approve such wiretaps, even retroactively -- is inadequate, the administration can come to Congress to approve a new law, Kerry said.

Al Qaeda No. 2: Bush a liar, 'spiller of Muslim blood'
Adjust font size:
(CNN) -- Calling President Bush "the murderer and spiller of Muslim blood," al Qaeda's top deputy released a videotape Friday accusing the U.S. president of being a "deceitful charlatan" who has lied to the American people. Ayman al-Zawahiri also blasts the Bush administration for holding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, an alleged 9/11 conspirator, in a secret prison and alleging that Mohammed gave interrogators "valuable information which has helped the crusaders to kill and arrest a number of al Qaeda." "I ask this lying failure, who are the leaders of al Qaeda whose killing or capture was facilitated by the information extracted from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?" al-Zawahiri asks. "Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, may Allah free him, has hurt you thousands of times more than you have hurt him."On another portion of the tape, which appears to have been recorded at a different time and location, the terror leader addresses recent controversial remarks by Pope Benedict XVI and the situation in Darfur, Sudan. (Watch al-Zawahiri rail against Bush and the pope -- 1:33 )Notably missing from al-Zawahiri's remarks is any mention of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who has been the subject of unconfirmed reports that he is dead or ill. (Full story)The tape, which runs almost 18 minutes, was posted on the Internet with English subtitles. On it, al-Zawahiri warns that al Qaeda will exact revenge for any harm to Mohammed and others in U.S. prisons. The mujahedeen "are a people who do not sleep under oppression and who do not abandon our revenge until our chests have been healed of those who have aggressed against us."Mohammed, who al-Zawahiri described as "leader of a march, pioneer of an awakening and vanguard of a nation," was among 14 "high-value detainees" who transferred to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, earlier this month to prepare for trials.Al-Zawahiri goes on to say that the U.S. military casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq indicate that the mujahedeen is still strong, "attacking, seeking martyrdom, advancing and injuring you on a daily basis with Allah's help.""Can't you be honest at least once in your life and admit that you are a deceitful liar who intentionally deceived your nation when you drove them to war in Iraq under the pretext of the presence of nuclear weapons there and under the pretext of al Qaeda's connections with Saddam Hussein, following which evidence proved that you intentionally lied and misled?" al-Zawahiri asks. Al-Zawahiri accuses the United States of waging war on Islam under the banner of the war on terror. He says Washington is using its allies in the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan to capture Muslims "whom you made to taste at your hands and the hands of your agents various types of punishment and torture."In remarks directed again at Bush, al-Zawahiri warns, "And be aware, you deceitful charlatan, that you are not facing individuals or organizations, but rather are facing the Muslim nation in which the spirit of jihad flows and which refuses humiliation under Zionist/crusader arrogance."A previous taped statement by al-Zawahiri came on September 10, the eve of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. In it he told the West, "Your leaders are hiding from you the true extent of the disaster."Catholicism called a religion 'made of myths'The second portion of the tape addresses remarks by Pope Benedict XVI, who earned the ire of Muslims by quoting a 14th-century Byzantine emperor during a speech earlier this month in Germany. (Full story)"Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached," the pontiff said, setting off a firestorm of criticism. Benedict has expressed regret for offending Muslims and said the emperor's words do not reflect his personal views, but he has not offered an apology.On the tape, al-Zawahiri calls the leader of the Roman Catholic Church an "impostor" whose religion "is made of myths, like the Trinity, crucifixion, sacrifice and the original sin.""This impostor, Benedict, reminds us of another impostor, his predecessor [Pope] Urban II from the 11th century in Clermont, France, who urged the people of Europe to kill the Muslims and launched the crusades," al-Zawahiri says.Benedict, he says, "went beyond his way to defame us, [but] we will respond to his insult with kindness."The Vatican said it had no comment on the tape. Benedict is at his summer residence in Castelgandolfo and is expected to make a public appearance Sunday. He is scheduled to return to the Vatican on October 3.Al-Zawahiri also criticizes the United Nations for proposing to send peacekeepers into Darfur to quell the violence there. He calls the government in Khartoum, which has rejected the proposal but expressed interest in bolstering the African Union forces there, as "deceitful and hypocritical." "Rise, O Muslim nation, to defend your land and your honors from the crusaders' aggression who are now hiding behind the masks of the United Nations," al-Zawahiri says. "Nothing will protect you but a jihadi popular war that will be led by the mujahedeen."Al-Zawahiri closes his message by cautioning Muslims to reject governments that do not accept sharia, or Islamic law, and others that cooperate with the United States, particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Half a billion eggs have been recalledBy the CNN Wire Staff Egg recall expandingSTORY HIGHLIGHTSHillandale Farms has recalled some 170.4 million eggsThe CDC estimates hundreds of Americans have been sickened by contaminated eggsIowa's Wright County Egg has recalled 380 million eggsThe Egg Safety Center has a complete list of recalled eggs, their expiration dates, and brands. Check the situation in your state. Here are safety tips. (CNN) -- The number of eggs recalled in a nationwide salmonella scare has grown to more than half a billion. Iowa egg producer Hillandale Farms of Iowa is voluntarily recalling some 170.4 million eggs distributed to stores and companies that service, or are located in, 14 states, a spokeswoman at the Egg Safety Center said on Friday. The Hillandale eggs were distributed under the Hillandale Farms, Sunny Farms, and Sunny Meadow brand names in six-egg cartons, dozen-egg cartons, 18-egg cartons, 30-egg packages, and five-dozen-egg cases, the website for the Egg Safety Center said. Loose eggs, which could be repackaged by customers, were packaged under the Wholesome Farms and West Creek brands in 15- and 30-dozen tray packs, according to the Egg Safety Center. The eggs affected by this recall either have plant number P1860 with date codes ranging from 099 to 230, or plant number P1663 and date codes ranging from 137 to 230, the website said. The salmonella outbreak prompted Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, which began recalling eggs last week, to increase its recall to 380 million eggs on Wednesday. The number of salmonella cases is expected to grow because infections after July 17 may not have been reported yet due to a two- to three-week lag between when a person becomes sick and when the case gets reported in the system, the CDC said. When salmonella becomes deadly "We would certainly characterize this as one of the largest shell egg recalls in recent history," Sherri McGarry of the Food and Drug Administration said in a conference call Thursday. DON'T EAT THE CAKE BATTER!You don't have to be cracking and chugging like Rocky Balboa to come into contact with raw eggs. Here are a few dishes in which raw or undercooked eggs might pop up:  Cake batter Cookie dough Some ice creams Steak tartare Caesar dressing Bearnaise sauce Hollandaise Homemade mayonnaise Aoli Eggnog Mousse Egg white cocktails like a Ramos Gin Fizz Tiramisu Meringue
POLL:In wake of recall, will you eat eggs?
On July 9, the FDA announced it had new safety rules for large-scale egg producers, but that came after the salmonella outbreak apparently began. "The outbreak could have been prevented." McGarry said. "The egg safety rule is in a phase-in approach, but there are measures that would have been in place that could have prevented this if it [had] been placed earlier than in July." The FDA's new rules cover refrigeration of stored and transported eggs, pasteurization, rodent control, cleanliness and they require a written Salmonella enteritidis prevention plan. The agency said "implementing the preventive measures would reduce the number of Salmonella enteritidis infections from eggs by nearly 60 percent." Animal welfare groups have criticized conditions of farms operated by Wright County Egg, including the Maine Contract Farming facility in Turner, Maine. Mercy for Animals, a nonprofit animal welfare group, conducted an undercover video investigation of the farm in 2009, and forwarded its findings to Maine animal welfare officials. Jack DeCoster, who leads Wright County Egg, in June pleaded guilty to 10 civil counts of animal cruelty over his company's treatment of its chickens, said Dr. Donald E. Hoenig, state veterinarian. DeCoster and his company agreed to a $25,000 fine and made a $100,000 payment to reimburse the state for future monitoring of the facility. Allegations included too many birds in case, injured chickens not being treated, dead animals not being promptly removed from cages and improper euthanization, Hoenig told CNN. "Since then, the company ... has followed all of our requirements," he said. "It's no surprise that these birds that are crammed together, basically defacating on top of other birds," said Dan Hauff, director of investigations for Mercy for Animals. "It's no surprise that this is the outcome, this type of outbreak." Eggs explained: Free-range, cage-free, organic Thoroughly cooking eggs kills salmonella bacteria within, but there is still risk of cross-contamination if a food preparer doesn't properly wash kitchen utensils, such as whisks or spatulas, that came into contact with the raw eggs. Undercooked food also leaves the consumer at risk of infection. Salmonella, which is generally contracted from contaminated poultry, meat, eggs, or water, affects the intestinal tract. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps, which typically begin within 12 to 72 hours, according to the CDC. Vomiting, chills, headache and muscle pains also may occur, according to the Mayo Clinic. These symptoms last about four to seven days, and then go away without specific treatment in healthy people. Antidiarrheal medications may help with cramps, but they may also prolong the diarrhea, the Mayo Clinic said. The elderly, infants, and people with impaired immune systems are at heightened risk for developing a more serious illness because of salmonella, the CDC said. Some people can develop life-threatening complications if the infection spreads beyond the intestines. Chickens can pass the bacteria to eggs because the eggs leave hens through the same passageway as feces, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service. Alternatively, bacteria in the hen's ovary or oviduct can get to the egg before the shell forms around it, FSIS said. Video: Egg recall vindicates

After the uptick in salmonella infections, the CDC and the FDA traced the source and determined it was most likely eggs from Wright County Egg. The company says it is working to determine how the shell eggs are being contaminated. "Wright County Egg is fully cooperating with FDA's investigation by undertaking this voluntary recall," the company said in a statement. "Our primary concern is keeping salmonella out of the food supply and away from consumers. As a precautionary measure, Wright County Egg also has decided to divert its existing inventory of shell eggs from the recalled plants to a breaker, where they will be pasteurized to kill any salmonella bacteria present." Krista Eberle, director of food safety programs at the Egg Safety Center, which is run by United Egg Producers, a cooperative of U.S. egg farmers, reiterated that only shell eggs are affected by the Wright County recall. "From what we know they only do shell eggs, and if they did extra egg products, they are still considered to be safe," Eberle said. She added that egg products such as egg whites and dried eggs go through pasteurization and extensive heat treatment, so they're considered safe to eat and the Egg Safety Center is not concerned the other products might be sullied with bacteria. Country Eggs, Inc. on Thursday said it is voluntary recalling specifically-dated shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg. Eggs were distributed to food wholesalers, distribution centers and food-service companies in California, Arizona and Nevada, according to a statement. Eggs were packaged under the Country Eggs, Inc. brand name in 15 dozen bulk pack with the identifying plant code of P 1946 and P 1026. Julian date codes are 216-221. Dates and codes can be found on the box label. In addition, NuCal Foods, which, on its website, calls itself the largest distributor of shell eggs in the western United States, announced Thursday it was "voluntarily recalling specific ... dates of shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg and packaged by NuCal Foods because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella." Wednesday's recall covers eggs branded as Albertsons, Farm Fresh, James Farms, Glenview, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma, Lund, Kemps and Pacific Coast and are marked with a three-digit code ranging from 136 to 229 and plant numbers1720 and 1942, the company said. The earlier recall covered the Lucerne, Albertson, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma, Sunshine, Hillandale, Trafficanda, Farm Fresh, Shoreland, Lund, Dutch Farms and Kemps brands that were marked with with a three-digit code ranging from 136 to 225 and plant numbers 1026, 1413 and 1946. The four-digit plant number begins with "P - " and is followed by the three-digit code. Both recalls affect eggs packed in several different sized cartons, from a half-dozen to 18 eggs. Only shell eggs are affected by the recall, the company said. Consumers are encouraged to return the eggs in their original packaging to where they were purchased for a full refund.CNN's Elizabeth Landau, Caitlin Hagan, Val Willingham, Mark Morgenstein and Phil Gast contributed to this report

Health Care Reform
(CNN) -- A federal court in Richmond, Virginia, is scheduled to conduct the nation's first appellate review of President Barack Obama's health care overhaul Tuesday, giving the controversial legislation a major legal test. Federal judges across the country have been divided over the constitutionality of the law's "individual mandate" requiring most Americans to buy health insurance by 2014 or face financial penalties. The law also mandates the expansion of Medicaid, the low-income health care program administered by the states. The Supreme Court could be asked to take formal jurisdiction of one or more health care appeal by this fall and perhaps decide the matter by 2012, a presidential election year. The three-judge appeals panel will hear two cases Tuesday, one filed by the state of Virginia and the other by private Liberty University, a Christian evangelical institution. The Liberty University plaintiffs, among other things, contend the law would allow taxpayer dollars to fund abortions, a claim the Obama administration rejects. Virginia state officials argue the Constitution's Commerce Clause does not give government the authority to force Americans to purchase a commercial product, like health insurance, that they may not want or need. The state equates such a requirement to a burdensome regulation of "inactivity." Virginia is one of the few states in the country with a specific law saying residents cannot be forced to buy insurance. The Justice Department counters that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not "choose" to participate in the health care market. Federal officials have cited 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services -- costs which are shifted to insurance companies and are passed on to consumers. Appeals courts in Atlanta and Cincinnati are set to tackle the divisive issue next month. Share this on:

GOP, time to rebrand in the image of the 'Great Emancipator'
By Wade Henderson, Special to CNN
updated 3:43 PM EST, Wed January 2, 2013
Wade Henderson thinks the modern Republican Party should look to Abraham Lincoln for some inspiration.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Wade Henderson: January 1 is 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation He says GOP should look to Lincoln, a canny politician who led moral fight on civil rights
He says GOP has history of civil rights support that it has largely abandoned in recent years
Henderson: In 2012, election minority voters unimpressed; GOP should return to roots
Editor's note: Wade Henderson is the president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and The Leadership Conference Education Fund.
(CNN) -- On January 1, the nation will commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, which legally freed slaves in the secessionist Southern states. Meanwhile, thousands of theaters will still be presenting the film "Lincoln," portraying the soon-to-be-martyred president's efforts in January 1865 to persuade the House of Representatives to pass the 13th Amendment, outlawing slavery throughout the nation.
Coming at a time when many Republicans are seeking to rebrand their party, these commemorations of the first Republican president raise this question: Why not refashion the Grand Old Party in the image of the Great Emancipator?
Steven Spielberg's historical drama, as well as the biography upon which it is based, Doris Kearns Goodwin's "Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln," both remind today's Americans that Lincoln was not only a moral leader but also a practical politician. The political identity that Lincoln forged for the fledgling Republican Party -- uniting the nation while defending individual rights -- was a winning formula for half a century, with the GOP winning 11 of 13 presidential elections from 1860 through 1908.
Wade Henderson
Moreover, support for civil rights persisted in the party throughout the last century. Among the Republican presidents of the 20th century, Theodore Roosevelt famously hosted Booker T. Washington at the White House. Dwight Eisenhower ordered federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, to enforce school desegregation. Richard Nixon expanded affirmative action. And George H. W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act into law.

Emancipation Proclamation turns 150
In the U.S. Senate, such prominent Republicans as Edward Brooke of Massachusetts (the first African-American senator since Reconstruction), Jacob Javits of New York and Everett Dirksen of Illinois were strong supporters of civil rights, as were governors such as Nelson Rockefeller in New York, George Romney in Massachusetts and William Scranton in Pennsylvania.
Former California Gov. Earl Warren served as chief justice when the Supreme Court issued its decision in Brown v. Board of Education, ordering the desegregation of the nation's schools. As recently as 1996, the Republican national ticket consisted of two strong civil rights advocates, former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and former New York Rep. Jack Kemp.

Unfortunately, by 2012, the Republican Party had veered far from its heritage as the party of Lincoln. Prominent Republicans supported statewide voter suppression laws that hit hardest at vulnerable minorities or called for the "self-deportation" of immigrants and their families.
While some Republican senatorial nominees needlessly offended women, leading moderates such as Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe and Ohio Rep. Steven LaTourette opted for retirement. In what I hope was rock bottom, 38 Senate Republicans rebuffed their former presidential nominee Bob Dole -- a wheelchair-bound war hero -- to block an international civil and human rights treaty for people with disabilities.
150 years later, myths persist about the Emancipation Proclamation
Not surprisingly, the GOP in the presidential race lost the black vote by 87 points, the Asian-American vote by 47 points, the Latino vote by 44 points and the women's vote by 11 points, according to CNN exit polls. As Republicans reflect on their path forward with minority voters and persuadable whites, there are opportunities to advance civil rights.

Sally Field: 25-lb. gain 'horrifying'
While the GOP has increasingly promoted diverse candidates, it has not yet begun to reflect the values of our diverse nation. Fiscally conservative officeholders can fight for civil and human rights.
Just a few years ago, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions championed a reduction in the sentencing disparity between people charged with possession of crack and powder cocaine. These are two forms of the same drug, but crack cocaine is used more by minorities and carried much harsher punishments for possession. Working with Sessions, civil rights advocates pushed to reduce this disparity significantly -- among the greatest advances in criminal justice reform in decades.
Looking forward to the 113th Congress, there are several civil rights initiatives that would fit conservative values. They need congressional champions. Conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist and conservative strategist Richard Viguerie have called for criminal justice reforms that would reduce the number of prisoners in U.S. prisons.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has joined the civil rights coalition's call for federal initiatives to narrow the educational achievement gap between minority and white students. And more Republicans are joining Jeb Bush's support for comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship for long-term, law-abiding residents.
Most importantly, the GOP must embrace one of Lincoln's most enduring legacies, the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed the right to vote regardless of race. The GOP must stop trying to suppress voters and begin to champion electoral reform that shortens lines and helps more people to vote.
Opinion: What Obama can learn from Lincoln
I don't expect another Abraham Lincoln or Frederick Douglass from the modern Republican Party -- I'll settle for a few more Jeff Sessions. When Republicans consider the consequences for their party's narrow appeal, they'll try to return to their roots.
I'm happy to help.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Watch hippos and crocodiles along the Chobe River between Botswana and Namibia
Trips between Gothenburg and Stockholm go along three canals and through 66 locks
Discover former Indochina on boutique vessels traveling the Mekong River
(CNN) -- Just when it seems all rivers have been charted, seas explored and canals crossed, secret backwaters move into the limelight. While cruise companies have traditionally focused on more popular circuits, increasing attention is being paid to off-the-radar bodies of water.
Cruise providers are noticing an uptick in enthusiasm for offbeat boating. Orient-Express Trains & Cruises is adding its second ship to river itineraries in burgeoning Myanmar (also known as Burma ).
"Our decision to introduce our newest river cruiser, Orcaella, in July 2013 is evidence of our commitment to Myanmar, one of the few places yet to be fully discovered," says managing director Gary Franklin. "So we wish to use our experience to delve farther off the beaten track."
Travel photos you wish you'd taken
Micato Safaris, which offers bespoke tours to India, has seen a recent spike in inquiries about river cruising in the country's southern state of Kerala. "Cruising Kerala's backwaters provides a wonderful contrast to the hustle and bustle of India's cities," says managing director Dennis Pinto. "A sail through reveals a serene and peaceful world, where one can observe the quieter lifestyles of the villagers who make their living in these resource-rich backwaters."
There is something to be said for drifting along uncharted waterways and quietly observing the shores. The silent distance adds a special touch to a voyage, whether it separates you from the African bush or picturesque Swedish landscape. It also comes as no surprise that many of these waterways are quickly morphing from secretive to spotlighted—such as Myanmar's Irrawaddy River—while others remain rarely plied. Bon voyage.
Departures: Cruising the Mediterranean
Amazon River, Peru
While the Amazon River is not a secret, many of its tributaries are. Aqua Expeditions does three-, four- and seven-night cruises on M/V Aqua and M/V Aria, two boutique river vessels that travel deep into the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve at the headwaters of the Amazon. Tour the jungle town of Iquitos before plying the untouched waters of the Maranon, Ucayali and Yanallpa rivers. Experience piranha fishing and walks through the rainforest to spot playful monkeys or relax on the rooftop deck and view neon-brilliant birds and rare pink dolphins. Panoramic windows wrap around the large design suites; Peruvian-European fusion fare is served onboard. Prices start at $2,685; 866-603-3687.
Chobe River, Namibia and Botswana
Few experiences match the thrill of a river safari along the Chobe River between Botswana and Namibia on the five-star Zambezi Queen. The cruiser provides an ideal vantage point from which to view the African grasslands and the river itself, which teems with hippos and crocodiles. Private balconies connect each of the 14 cabins to the outdoors and a contemporary dining room showcases three-sided views. After an exhilarating game drive, travel in a traditional mokoro canoe to visit local villages for a boma dinner, with a barbecue and dance performance under the stars. Sip a sundowner cocktail by the onboard pool while observing elephants, leopards, lions and buffalo along the riverbank. Prices start at $905 (two nights).
Departures: Sailing the Aeolian Islands
Danube River
Experience the "Romance of the Blue Danube" aboard the MS River Splendor as it makes its way through the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria and Germany. Inaugurated this month, the 176-passenger vessel offers intimate cruising with plush suites and private French balconies. Guests take in Budapest's imperial cityscape before embarking on an 11-day sail during which they witness a knight tournament and savor Tokaj wines before arriving in Vienna for a private concert at the Kursalon concert hall. Wend through vineyard-dotted Wachau Valley and meet a Habsburg descendant at Artstetten Castle. Stop in Mozart's hometown of Salzburg and, in Passau, hear the tunes of the world's largest church organ before traveling through forested gorges to reach the city of Regensburg. Prices start at $4,249.
Gota Canal, Sweden
Simply Sweden hosts three- to five-night cruises between Gothenburg and Stockholm on one of three period ships from the 1800s. These sailings go between the Baltic and North seas along three canals, across eight lakes and through 66 locks. (A hotel stay on either end allows guests to explore Sweden's two largest cities.) Glide through the Swedish countryside on a charming old cruiser with humble cabins and meals that star Nordic herring specialties. Excursions travel to never-invaded Karlsborg Fortress for a war re-enactment and to the canal museum in Sjotorp village for an introduction to the fascinating science of lock systems. In between the culture-packed outings, mingle with curious locals as the ship descends and ascends the lock staircases. Prices start at $2,158.
Departures: Top Alaska cruises
Irrawaddy River, Myanmar
Winding down the Irrawaddy, the scenic waterway that cuts right through Myanmar, is the most serene way to explore the Golden Land. Relive the journey in Rudyard Kipling's poem "On the Road to Mandalay" aboard Orient-Express' luxury Road to Mandalay cruiser, with three- to 11-night trips. Get a bird's-eye view of this forgotten land on a hot-air-balloon ride over the ancient kingdom of Bagan or see lacquerware being made. Unwind with a soothing east meets west massage and savor mohinga, the region's staple fish soup. Orient-Express is adding a second ship on the Irrawaddy River in July—the 50-guest Orcaella will take to the more remote sections of western Myanmar along the Chindwin River toward the Indian border. Prices start at $2,520.
Kerala Backwaters, India
For a unique ramble through the backwaters of Kerala, a southern Indian state that edges the Arabian Sea, pick a two- or three-night itinerary on The Oberoi Motor Vessel Vrinda. In Malayalam, the official language of Kerala, vrinda means beautiful and serene (or a bunch of flowers) and aptly describes the sojourn on this luxe backwater cruiser. Onboard find eight deluxe cabins with panoramic picture windows and a rich repertoire of events, such as a performance of Kathakali, a local dance interpretation of ancient Hindu epics. Culinary highlights include sadya, a traditional feast of a dozen small dishes served on a banana leaf, and available daily outings on a small traditional rice boat float past brightly colored houses, rice paddies and tea shops. Prices start at $1,641.
Departures: Most luxurious new cruises
Mekong River, Vietnam and Cambodia
Discover former Indochina aboard an array of boutique liners that travel the Mekong River between Vietnam and Cambodia. Luxury Cruise Mekong brings you the most luxe selection of colonial cruisers and traditional sampan skiffs. The showstopper is The Jayavarman, a French-colonial-style vessel with silky Indochine design accents. Choose between two- or seven-night cruises, which both kick off with an awakening tai chi lesson. Voyages down this living waterway wind through floating villages and rustic catfish farms and meet villagers as they prepare coconut candies and rice cookies. Alternatively, opt for a private cruise on a Song Xanh sampan (two nights, from $880), which goes deep into the Mekong Delta with visits to 19th-century French estates, temples and dinh, Vietnamese community halls. Prices start at $732.

'90s nostalgia-palooza: The decade in photos
By Breeanna Hare, CNN
updated 1:20 PM EDT, Tue October 1, 2013
Crop tops, bangs and boy bands are as popular in 2013 as they were in 1993, proving that the '90s is the one decade that never really left. Whether it's catching reruns of "Beverly Hills, 90210," buzzing about a "Jurassic Park" movie or eagerly awaiting an 'N Sync reunion, everything old is new again. In homage to the Lollapalooza festival, which started in 1991 and is still going strong, we present our own '90s nostalgia-palooza:
Although "Saved By the Bell" got its start in 1989, the half-hour comedy helped define a generation and is still popular in syndication. We don't care how many kids Mark-Paul Gosselaar has or how many hosting gigs Mario Lopez picks up, they're both eternally Zack and Slater to us. (Same goes for you, Elizabeth "I'm so excited!" Berkley.)
MC Hammer's hammer pants had a starring role in the music video for 1990's "U Can't Touch This," and, surprisingly, are still around. Just ask Justin Bieber.
Like Hammer, the flower-infested clothing Mayim Bialik's "Blossom" wore is once again in vogue. (We still can't defend her headgear though -- we know you remember those hats.)
Before Disney and Nickelodeon churned out child stars like the '90s churned out grunge bands, Macaulay Culkin stood in a kid star class of his own. If he hasn't yet trademarked his patented cheek-slap-and-scream move, he should. True, "Seinfeld" also technically launched in 1989 -- but what are the '90s without Jerry Seinfeld (left), George Costanza (played by Jason Alexander, right), Kramer and "The Elaine"?
"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" nostalgia transcends its 1990-1996 run both on TV and online. Since most of us can recite the lyrics to the classic theme song without blinking an eye, soon Internet pranksters were busy "Bel-Airing" innocent readers in comment sections instead of "rickrolling."
In 1991, Tim Allen was introduced to broadcast TV viewers as Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor, a handy family man with three boys. The middle son, played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, would become a swoon-worthy favorite. And then there was the odd neighbor named Wilson who peered over the fence. Nirvana's celebrating the 20th anniversary of "In Utero" this year, but that album's predecessor (and its album cover) "Nevermind" stands the test of time. The kid on the cover, by the way, is now in his 20s -- and he still gets introduced as "The Nirvana Baby."
Before becoming an Oscar-nominated actor, Mark Wahlberg was preoccupied with showing America his underwear as often as possible. Wahlberg would probably like to forget the "Marky Mark" '90s, but that image is etched into our memories forever. Before actresses and reality TV personalities became magazine cover stars, supermodels such as Cindy Crawford ran the show. Long before Britney Spears or Beyoncé landed lucrative endorsement deals with Pepsi, Crawford filmed the still iconic commercial in 1991. The boys -- and now men -- of New Kids on the Block have been "Hangin' Tough" for years. The recently revived NKOTB can still make fans weak out on tour, which lately includes fellow '90s stars 98 Degrees and Boyz II Men. Jaleel White has worked very hard to leave Steve Urkel in the '90s, but a character that great just can't die. Although "Family Matters," too, actually started in 1989, White's masterful portrayal is easily one of the most memorable roles of the decade that followed.
Whitney Houston's 1992 movie "The Bodyguard" proved she was more than just a singer, but her smash "I Will Always Love You" proved why she's one of the best. She covered Dolly Parton's song so well that amateur performers still can't help but sing along. The ladies of TLC -- that would be Chili, Left-Eye and T-Boz -- made their industry-changing entrance in 1992 with "Ooooooohhh ... on the TLC Tip." Between their frank approach to sex ("Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg"), smart writing ("What About Your Friends") and distinctive style (yep, the condoms), it makes sense that they were hailed as "a perfect pop group for the times." Still true, by the way.
Steven Spielberg's 1993 film "Jurassic Park" was such a classic, it even performed well 20 years later. When the 3-D version of the original was re-released in theaters in April 2013, it earned $18.6 million opening weekend. Let's run that past you again: $18.6 million, from a movie many moviegoers likely already own. This year, Lenny Kravitz is celebrating the 20th anniversary of his cornerstone album, "Are You Gonna Go My Way." Originally released in March 1993, a remastered and expanded version is now available. Few couples typify the '90s like Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love. With Cobain being the pied piper of Seattle grunge and Love the rebellious other half, the two -- along with their daughter, Frances Bean -- were rock royalty in 1993. Mariah Carey's incredible range was showcased for the first time in 1990, and by 1993, the singer had earned a reputation as the newest diva to watch. Know what else is incredible? Carey's staying power: The star notched another hit this summer with "#Beautiful." There are so many things about "Sleepless in Seattle" that make us wistful: A) Nora Ephron co-wrote and directed it (may she R.I.P.); B) Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were the '90s on-screen power couple; and C) the thought of someone finding love through a radio talk show and then flying to meet them is beyond quaint. Ben Savage (center) has done little else with his acting career outside of '90s family sitcom "Boy Meets World," but he doesn't have to. The comedy, which also starred Danielle Fishel (left), Rider Strong (right) and William Daniels, is so beloved the residuals will probably pay for his retirement. But instead of resting on his laurels, Savage is helping introduce Cory Matthews to a new generation: Disney's spinoff "Girl Meets World," also starring Fishel, will premiere in 2014.
You might think the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" were too cheesy to keep up with today's superheroes, but the franchise is actually still kicking. Twenty years after "Power Rangers" first premiered, Nickelodeon just debuted new episodes of "Power Rangers Megaforce."
The dictionary might as well use a photo of "Reality Bites" as the definition for the '90s. The 1994 film, directed by Ben Stiller, had it all: Winona Ryder (right), Ethan Hawke (left), Janeane Garofalo and lots of angsty discussion about the meaning of life. For some reason, Stiller wants to bring the movie back as a TV series. "ER" was must-see TV for many, and while George Clooney (left) is now an actor and director extraordinaire, we loved him as the womanizing Dr. Doug Ross on that series.
Before "American Horror Story," it was "The X-Files" that provided our weekly creepy quotient. You shouldn't hold your breath that we'll ever get a third film, but on the bright side, both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are open to reprising their roles of Agents Mulder and Scully.
Kelsey Grammer's Frasier Crane was such a popular character in the '90s, he thinks it even landed him a wife. When it comes to his ex Camille, Grammer has said he thinks she married him not because he was a TV icon but specifically "because I was Frasier." Somehow, when "Beavis and Butt-head" returned to MTV in 2011 after 14 years off the air, they were just as immature as they were after first being introduced in 1993. And fans loved it. Claire Danes is now picking up Emmys as "Homeland's" Carrie Mathison, whom we bet is the type of person who'd watch "My So-Called Life's" Angela Chase. Quirky, insecure, sensitive and completely relatable, the fact that "My So-Called Life" only lasted a single season is a crime against TV.
A decade of watching Rachel and Ross make up and break up in between meeting the rest of their "Friends" at Central Perk still wasn't enough for fans. Unfortunately, there are zero plans for a reunion or a movie.
Jim Carrey first found fame as a member of the ensemble cast "In Living Color," which set him up for a very busy 1994. That year saw Carrey release films like "The Mask," "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" and "Dumb and Dumber," the latter of which is getting a sequel. "The Mask" helped establish Carrey as a comedic actor who specialized in over-the-top characters.
Disney's 1994 movie not only had tons of cat lovers naming their pets "Simba," but it also introduced the phrase "hakuna matata" into the American lexicon. The film hasn't lost its popularity in the years since its release and even spurred a successful Broadway musical in 1997. When the studio decided to re-release the animated film in 3-D in 2011, it topped the box office two weeks in a row. Again, we say: that's some serious fandom.
For a life and career that was all-too-brief, Notorious B.I.G. left a mammoth impact. In 1994, the rapper released his debut, "Ready to Die," and in the process created a legacy that lived on after his death in 1997.
For some, the '90s are a hazy memory with an Alanis Morissette soundtrack. The Canadian musician released "Jagged Little Pill" in 1995 and became inescapable with hits such as "Ironic," "You Oughta Know" and "Head Over Feet."
Their 1993 album, "Siamese Dream," helped establish the Smashing Pumpkins on the music scene. But it was their double 1995 album, "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness," that had the biggest splash. The group went on to be one of the biggest of the decade.
In 1995, multifaceted rapper/actor Tupac Shakur was as well known for his artistry as he was for his fiery personality. His private troubles didn't slow his success, though: As Pac headed for prison in 1995, his album "Me Against the World" was headed for No. 1. Today, in his absence, the slain rapper is celebrated as an icon -- and hologram.
With Mel Gibson's personal problems swerving into his professional life, we wouldn't be surprised if many of you prefer to remember the 1995 version of the actor -- covered in war paint and yelling, "They may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!"
Rebecca Black has laid claim to the fifth day of the week, but in 1995, "Friday" was the domain of Chris Tucker (left) and Ice Cube. The ever-so-quotable movie, directed by F. Gary Gray, spawned a few follow-ups, but the original is hands-down the best.
In September 2013, a New Yorker profile revealed that Alicia Silverstone was almost cast as Claire Danes' Angela Chase in "My So-Called Life." But there's an actress for every part, and we're hard-pressed to think of another star who could've embodied Cher Horowitz in the 1995 classic "Clueless" the way Silverstone (right) did. Tom Cruise had Renee Zellweger's Dorothy and the entire audience at "hello" in 1996's "Jerry Maguire." Audiences fell in love with Cruise as a sports agent who finds love while trying to find his way. But the big winner was Cuba Gooding Jr., whose performance as Rod "Show Me the Money" Tidwell earned him the best supporting actor Oscar.
Jamiroquai was popular in the United Kingdom before 1996, fronted by the charismatic singer Jay Kay. Their single "Virtual Insanity" -- and its accompanying music video -- broke the group out into the mainstream in the United States, inspiring style copycats.
R&B singer Aaliyah quietly sneaked up on the unsuspecting in 1994, when she released her debut album "Age Ain't Nothing but a Number" with the help of her then-mentor, R. Kelly. Controversy came in the form of a marriage license published by Vibe Magazine that purported to show Kelly had wed a then 15-year-old Aaliyah (her age was listed as 18). ABC News reported that the marriage was annulled and with support from producers Missy Elliott and Timbaland, Aaliyah went on to solidify her status as an R&B princess before her death in a plane crash in 2001. Now there is a posthumous Aaliyah album in the works.
We hope the movie about the making of 1997's "Good Will Hunting" is going to arrive any day now, because Matt Damon's working bromance with Ben Affleck (right) is part of Hollywood history. When the two teamed up to write the screenplay, they memorably took their story all the way to the Oscars. The pair is seen here with Minnie Driver.
For an anti-social teen, Daria Morgendorffer is still incredibly popular. No one has really made peace with the ending of "Daria" after five seasons in 2001 -- not even the show's network, MTV. They've recently joined the Internet in campaigning for a live-action film based on the animated series about an angsty, dry-witted high school student. The three Hanson brothers "MMMBop"ed their way into pop culture and many a young girl's heart. They may be married dads now, but they haven't forgotten how good the '90s were to them -- they crafted a beer named after their biggest hit.
After crossing over from the United Kingdom to the States and the rest of the world with "Wannabe" in 1996, the Girls spawned two back-to-back best-selling albums, a movie and plenty of hysteria. It's been nearly 20 years since their pop domination, and the group's still got it: At the 2012 Summer Olympics, the five members reunited for a performance at the London games. Sarah Michelle Gellar's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" would be right at home in today's pop culture landscape filled with butt-kicking heroines. There's actually the slightest possibility that the 1997 Joss Whedon series could make a return as a movie: "If there was ever the right story, we would do it," Gellar said this fall. We would say that the Backstreet Boys are back, but we're not sure if they ever really left. While the group took a break in the early 2000s, they're now celebrating their 20th anniversary, with a new album to boot.
Near, far, wherever you are, you probably recognize this epic scene from James Cameron's 1997 film "Titanic." The movie, which gave Leonardo DiCaprio official heartthrob status and Kate Winslet an Oscar nomination, is the second-highest grossing film of all time in the States. It also gave Celine Dion a huge hit in the theme song that you are probably hearing in your head right now.
In 1998, a quad of then-unknown teens stepped into roles that would come to define their lives. "Dawson's Creek" lasted for six seasons, but its popularity is still strong 10 years after the series finale. Need proof? Star James Van Der Beek's recent role on "Don't Trust the B----" revolved around the fact that he's "Beek from the Creek." Michelle Williams (left), Katie Holmes (third from left) and Joshua Jackson (right) haven't done too badly for themselves either.
The Backstreet Boys had to battle for boy band domination in the late '90s with the likes of 'N Sync, fronted at the time by a curly-haired Justin Timberlake. (The mystery of those curls has remained unsolved.) Interestingly enough, the tables have now turned: Whereas 'N Sync was killing it in 1998, in 2013 they could barely reunite for more than a minute.
Marilyn Manson was one of the most controversial figures of the '90s, although the debate over his music didn't boil over until the latter half of the decade. From his "Antichrist Superstar" album to his iconic style, Manson became both the poster child -- and scapegoat -- for disaffected youth. Believe it or not, "Sex and the City" first debuted in 1998. And somehow, even with episodes in constant rotation on cable plus two so-so movies, Sarah Jessica Parker (third from left) is still considering giving Carrie Bradshaw another go. Also pictured from left: Cynthia Nixon as Miranda Hobbes, Kristin Davis as Charlotte York, Parker, and Kim Cattrall as Samantha Jones.
Britney Spears wasted no time putting her Mouseketeer days firmly behind her when she launched a pop career in 1999. The song, "Baby One More Time," was tailor-made for radio, but it was the slightly salacious music video that sold it. Somewhere, there are adults who still remember every dance move. Eminem politely introduced himself in 1999's not-so-polite track, "Hi, My Name Is." Between his effortless, rapid-fire flow and his pop culture-savvy music video, Slim Shady didn't need much more of an introduction than that.
California trio blink-182 was on its fourth album when it hit radio paydirt in 1999. With songs such as "All the Small Things" and "What's My Age Again?," blink-182 became a household name after seven years in the industry.
Who ran the world before Beyoncé? Destiny's Child. In 1999, Queen Bey (right) was reigning over a girl group with a rotating cast, but hot singles nonetheless. As listeners prepared for the new millennium, they had Destiny's Child in their ears. Also pictured from left: Former members LaTavia Roberson, LeToya Luckett and Kelly Rowland.

Observers ask: Is Sochi ready?
By Jason Miks, CNN
updated 7:31 AM EST, Thu February 6, 2014
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Among the terror concerns is explosives in toothpaste tubes on planes
Preparations in the Winter Olympics host city are up against the wire
Complaints about accommodations, water are getting media attention One bright spot is the weather; officials say snowfall has been ample (CNN) -- Never judge a book by its cover -- and never judge a major sports event before it has begun. Just ask Delhi, India, which was rocked by some dismal headlines on safety and infrastructure ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games before recovering to win praise from the head of the quadrennial event.
Still, with just under two days to go before the opening ceremony, preparations for the Sochi Winter Olympics are looking far from complete.
From hotels that don't appear to be finished, to ongoing security concerns, to reports of officials poisoning stray dogs -- none of this will be what Russian President Vladimir Putin would have hoped to see when he arrived in Sochi on Tuesday.
So, what are the biggest concerns? Four issues have been grabbing headlines this week for reasons that have nothing to do with the upcoming sporting activities.
Security
The most important duty of any host nation is surely to ensure the safety of athletes and visitors, but simmering tensions in the nearby North Caucasus region of the country -- where Islamic separatists have conducted a string of deadly attacks -- have meant that the threat of terrorism has loomed large over Sochi. Indeed, Doku Umarov, who has named himself emir of a self-proclaimed entity called the Caucasus Emirate, last year called on jihadists to do their "utmost to derail these satanic dances on the bones of our ancestors."
Tens of thousands of police and troops have been dispatched to the area to create what Putin has described as a "ring of steel" protecting the games.
But questions were raised about the ability to protect soft targets when Russian officials released photographs of three "black widows" -- young women whose husband purportedly were killed by Russian forces -- who allegedly were planning to bomb the Olympic torch relay. There was particular concern about a fourth suspect, Ruzanna Ibragimova, who officials said might be in the Sochi area.
The sun rises over Sochi's Olympic Park on January 10, 2014. The 2014 Winter Olympics will run February 7 - 23 in Sochi, Russia. Six thousand athletes from 85 countries are scheduled to attend the 22nd Winter Olympics. Here's a look at the estimated $50 billion transformation of Sochi for the Games. Soaring snowcapped peaks, some topping 10,000 feet, tower over the Black Sea resort city of Sochi on January 22, 2007. These are Russia's first Olympic Games, although the former Soviet Union hosted the 1980 Summer Olympic Games in Moscow. The city of Sochi, which is also a fishing town, was among three finalists bidding for the Olympics. Salzburg, Austria, and Pyeongchang, South Korea, also competed. In the Imeretinskay Valley, a woman plays with a dog in February 2007, near an advertisement for the Olympic Park soon to be built in the area. Organizers of the Sochi Olympics say they want these Games to be the greenest, most environmentally aware games ever staged. Construction vehicles travel along the Imeretinskaya Valley, the site of Olympic facilities for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, in April 2009.
Ice events will be held in a "cluster" near the Black Sea in the Imeretinskaya Valley. The second "cluster" will be for skiing and sliding events and will be held in the Krasnaya Polyana Mountains. People work on their vegetable gardens near the construction site of the Olympic facilities in the Imeretinskaya Valley in April 2009.
This September 2010 photo shows ski facilities under construction in Krasnaya Polyana near Sochi.
The Grand Ice Palace, intended for ice hockey, is under construction here in October 2010. A construction worker walks on the top of the building site of the Bolshoi Ice Palace in Sochi in June 2010.

The Olympic rings light up the sky outside Sochi International Airport. An estimated 3 billion people are expected to watch the Olympics on television.

Sochi transformed Ex- IOC official: Judge Sochi later
Hotel conditions in Sochi are sketchy
Advocacy group targets Olympic sponsors
Maria Sharapova's defends Sochi
Welcome to Sochi: City of contrasts
On Wednesday, Russian media announced that police in Dagestan had killed the alleged mastermind behind twin bomb attacks in the Russian city of Volgograd in December. The bombings killed 34 people and injured 100.
Those attacks, along with a pair of January incidents in the restive North Caucasus republic of Dagestan -- a restaurant bombing that injured at least five people and a shootout that left three policemen and four militants dead -- underscored fears that terrorists might look to strike outside of Sochi during the Games, when all eyes will be on Russia.
"The Russians' task is complicated by remote, forested and often mountainous territory in the North Caucasus, as well as a devolved structure among jihadist groups, organized into autonomous military units known as jamaats," noted CNN's Tim Lister. "Terrorism analysts believe that some among the growing Chechen diaspora in Europe may also be raising funds for the insurgents."
Also Wednesday, a law enforcement source told CNN that the United States has advised airlines with direct flights to Russia to be aware of the possibility that explosive materials could be concealed in toothpaste or cosmetic tubes.
The source emphasized that there was no known threat to the United States, but the notice to U.S. and international carriers is based on new intelligence information ahead of the start of the Olympics.
Airlines warned about possible toothpaste tube bombs ahead of Olympics
And on Tuesday, Matthew Olsen, director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, warned that the United States was tracking a number of "specific threats of varying degrees of credibility."
"[W]e're working very closely with the Russians and with other partners to monitor any threats we see and to disrupt those," Olsen added.
The United States already has dispatched at least two warships off the coast of the Black Sea city in the event that an evacuation is necessary, while a number of athletes have reportedly asked relatives to skip attending the games.
Americans apparently have noticed such concerns -- a CNN poll released Wednesday showed that 57% believed a terrorist attack on the Games is likely.
Infrastructure
If the security of athletes and spectators is the biggest issue for the organizers, then ensuring that facilities for both competitors and guests are up to scratch is surely the next concern.
After all, athletes have been training for years for this event. For some it will be their only shot at Olympic glory. Is having somewhere comfortable to sleep, perhaps with a fresh glass of water by the bedside, too much to ask as you prepare for the biggest two weeks of your life?
In Sochi, according to numerous accounts on social media this week, the answer might just be yes.
Bleacher Report has been highlighting some of the early reactions to the accommodations on offer, and draws particular attention to the size of the beds (Canada's men's hockey team may have been hoping to have a bit more space), the bareness of the rooms (reports of missing TVs, chairs and shower curtains) and, perhaps most troubling of all, the sign one reporter snapped warning that toilet paper should not be flushed down the toilet.
To cap it all, The Chicago Tribune's Stacy St. Clair reportedly complained that she had been warned about the hazardous water in her hotel room, and a picture she tweeted, showing two glasses of yellowish liquid she said were from the hotel, went viral.
Competition conditions
Setting aside the accommodation issues, will athletes be safe when they start competing? The withdrawal of U.S. snowboarding star Shaun White from one of the events could be a troubling sign. White didn't give a specific reason for his withdrawal, but even if a mere wrist injury is the only reason, Sochi organizers are said to have "faced fierce criticism over the layout at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, with competitors claiming that it is too dangerous to host the event."
Of course, one thing that the organizers have no control over is the weather, and after complaints about the lack of quality snow in Vancouver for the 2010 Winter Olympics, some had worried whether Sochi's climate could provide enough of the white stuff.
With such concerns in mind, Russia reportedly brought in state-of-the-art snowmaking equipment. But according to the Wall Street Journal, this won't be necessary.
"The weather for the upcoming week at all the Olympic venues will be just wonderful," the paper quoted the head of Russia's Hydrometeorological Center as saying this week. "Enough snow has fallen, the situation is completely relaxed. Nature has given us everything we need."
Warning to U.S. athletes: No Olympic uniforms outside Sochi venues
Those stray dogs
Yet, while issues like infrastructure and security seem destined to be perennial concerns at major sporting events -- just look at the controversy surrounding Brazil's efforts to prepare for this year's World Cup -- sometimes a story will appear out of the blue and make international headlines for all the wrong reasons.
On Wednesday, CNN correspondent Ivan Watson reported that Russian authorities have been rounding up and poisoning stray dogs in the city.
"They always poison the street dogs here," Watson quoted one Sochi resident as saying. "But in December it got terrible...they began poisoning the animals terribly before the Olympics."
Olympic officials, though, have a different take.
"All stray dogs that are found on the Olympic Park are collected by a professional veterinary contractor for the well-being of the people on the Park and the animals themselves," the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee said in a statement this week. "All healthy animals are released following their health check."
Sochi's organizers will no doubt be relieved when the focus is on the competition and not the venue. At around 8 p.m. local time Friday, perhaps they'll get what they're hoping for.

CNN - Victim Fighting Third Form of Disease - Nov. 14, 1995
Cancer Victim Fighting Third Form of Disease
Aired Nov. 14, 1995
7:45 a.m. EST (1245 GMT)
Abstract : One woman who is nearing what may be the end of her third battle with cancer
says the key to surviving is early detection. Susan Leigh also credits survivorship groups
which helped her with the fear of cancer.
Full Text: ANDREA ARCENEAUX, Anchor: What can cancer patients do to become long
term survivors. Well, joining us now is Susan Leigh, past president of the National
Coalition for Cancer Survivorship. She is an oncology nurse with personal knowledge of
cancer treatments. Leigh was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in 1974. Now five years
ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and this July she was diagnosed with bladder
cancer. Susan Leigh is in our Washington bureau and we thank you for joining us this
morning. SUSAN LEIGH, Cancer Survivor, National Coalition for Cancer
Survivorship: Thank you. ANDREA ARCENEAUX: Now, what is the status of the
bladder cancer? Are you still undergoing treatments and are they successful? SUSAN LEIGH: Fortunately, it's very, very early stage and I just finished my first round
of immunotherapy and actually I go back to Tucson and tomorrow I will have a repeat test
and biopsies to see how things are going. ANDREA ARCENEAUX: What is the key to
surviving cancer? SUSAN LEIGH: Oh, I think everybody has their own key to
surviving cancer, but certainly those of us who are involved in the survivorship movement
and even specifically the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, I think so many of us
feel that one of the major keys is information and being an informed consumer. ANDREA ARCENEAUX: And you mentioned just a moment ago that the bladder cancer was detected
early. Give us a little insight in to early detection and being an oncology nurse, you
probably had some insights already. But what can the average person do to make certain
that they stay on top of detection? SUSAN LEIGH: Some much is just being aware
of your health status and if you have any changes in bowel or bladder, if you have any
bleeding, if you have any lumps or bumps that shouldn't be there, moles on your skin. There are a number or warning signs that you really need to be aware of and then just go
and get them checked out. Actually, the American Cancer Society has a really nice list of
seven warning signs that all of us need to be aware of. ANDREA ARCENEAUX: And
what about treatments? Chemotherapy, radiation, some are even suggesting that diet can
help. As far as your personal experience, what was key? SUSAN LEIGH: Once again
is getting in as early as possible, finding physicians and the whole allied health care
team that's really on your side and is really helping you make the best choices for you
depending upon your specific situation. I'm very, very pro second opinions, third
opinions, fourth opinions, finding the people who can really help you make the best
decisions. ANDREA ARCENEAUX: What about surgery? Is surgery also always
necessary? SUSAN LEIGH: Oh sure! Surgery is one of the major forms of
treatment. A lot of times it's done for diagnostic reasons, but it's part of that whole
armamenterium of therapies that we have available. ANDREA ARCENEAUX: How much of
surviving is mental? SUSAN LEIGH: Oh, probably the majority of surviving is
mental. I think mental means you have to make the right decisions. That you have to be
proactive. That you have to make decisions that are right for you and not necessarily for
your family members or your health care team that's working with you. But it's really just
setting up the experience so you have as much power or empowered as we say today, to really
find the best available treatment. ANDREA ARCENEAUX: What was the toughest part
for you? SUSAN LEIGH: The toughest part, well, for which experience? It's
really hard to say. I've been dealing with this for almost 24 years. Actually my
Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed in 1972. So, I'm kind of what you'd call a professional
cancer survivor and I think one of the hardest things is dealing with the fear and I've had
this experience personally three times now. The fear is always there. But I think when
you have access to information, you have access to support systems, you know that there are
other people out there who are surviving these diseases, then that in fact helps you deal
with that fear and move on to do what you really need to do. ANDREA ARCENEAUX: Susan Leigh, we thank you for joining us this morning on Early Edition. SUSAN
LEIGH: Thank you.
