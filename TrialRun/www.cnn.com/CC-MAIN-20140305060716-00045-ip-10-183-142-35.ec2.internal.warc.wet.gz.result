Review: 'The Lovely Bones'By Lisa Schwarzbaum, Entertainment Weekly Saoirse Ronan is the lead in Peter Jackson's "The Lovely Bones." STORY HIGHLIGHTSScreen adaptation of Alice Sebold's striking novelReaders will be frustrated while newcomers to the story may be confusedIn Jackson's simplified telling, "The Lovely Bones" is intentionally made less upsetting for teens

(Entertainment Weekly) -- A dead 14-year-old girl named Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan), murdered on her way home from school in 1973, tells her story from heaven in "The Lovely Bones." In doing so, Susie follows the narrative path set for her in the striking 2002 novel by Alice Sebold on which this much-awaited adaptation by Peter Jackson is based. But as directed by the lord of "The Lord of the Rings" from a screenplay by Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens, his bleached "Bones" bears little resemblance to the book in either tone or complexity. Readers will be frustrated; newcomers to the story may wonder why what is now essentially a serial-killer thriller includes so many scenes of a heaven that looks like a gumdrop-colored hobbit shire, a magical place of fanciful special effects. In Jackson's simplified, sweetened, and CGI-besotted telling, "The Lovely Bones" is a sad-but-hopeful, dramatic-but-gentle fairy tale intentionally made less upsetting for teens. (There's no indication that Susie gets raped, as she does in the novel, and her murder occurs off screen.) "Atonement's" terrific Ronan, with her astonishing glacier-blue eyes, watches from a scenic afterlife as her father (Mark Wahlberg), mother (Rachel Weisz), younger siblings, and selected friends simultaneously heal from their loss and search for her killer. For comic relief, the family's boozy granny (Susan Sarandon) arrives, swathed in mink. Apparently participating in a burlesque movie, Sarandon camps it up, demonstrating terrible housekeeping skills and wreaking grande-dame havoc. As for the killer, he's in plain sight from the beginning: a creepy neighbor (Stanley Tucci) with the hopeless comb-over and furtive mustache of an easy-to-spot perv. Tucci is jolting in the role, honestly unsettling as he maintains an exterior of mildness that masks a grotesque interior. Electrifying danger accompanies his every scene. But this in itself becomes a problem, as that same energy leaves the screen when he does. Jackson reduces his "Lovely Bones", in the end, to the dramatic contrast between the menace of a hateful killer (will he be caught?) and the grief of a loving father (can he avenge his daughter's death?). Sebold's "Lovely Bones", on the other hand, is fleshed out with the perilous, irresistible power of sex the author acknowledges a real world of extramarital sex and sex between young lovers in addition to the heinous rape from which moviegoers are shielded. The filmmaker handled the sexual power of girls beautifully in 1994's "Heavenly Creatures". But here he shies from the challenge, shortchanging a story that isn't only about the lightness of souls in heaven but also about the urges of bodies on earth. Jackson forfeits depth for safe, surface loveliness. EW Grade: C+CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly

Zakaria: Obama must 'laser' focus on economyStory Highlights Fareed Zakaria: Obama should save presidential time, energy for the economy U.S. economy is in dangerous paralysis, says Zakaria Zakaria: War in Afghanistan is top foreign policy problem Obama should address Next Article in World » Editor's note: Fareed Zakaria is a foreign affairs analyst who hosts "Fareed Zakaria: GPS" on CNN at 1 and 6 p.m. ET Sundays. "Banks are still reporting large losses, credit remains tight, home prices continue to fall," notes Fareed Zakaria. NEW YORK (CNN) -- President Barack Obama offered more detail on his plan to restore economic growth Friday, saying the economic stimulus program being debated in Congress is just one of at least three parts to his recovery plan. In a meeting to discuss the stimulus proposal with Vice President Joe Biden and Democratic and Republican congressional leadership, Obama said America also needs an improved financial system stability program as well as an overhaul of financial market regulation. CNN talked to world affairs expert and author Fareed Zakaria to get his thoughts about the most pressing issues facing the new president. CNN: What should be President Obama's first order of business? Zakaria: Oh, without question, the economy. This is a problem that isn't going away. Banks are still reporting large losses, credit remains tight, home prices continue to fall. It's difficult to tell whether the measures enacted have not had time to work, or that they are not working. But the basic reality remains -- the financial system is in crisis, and as a result, the American economy is in a dangerous paralysis. President Obama needs to focus like a laser beam on this issue above and beyond everything else. 'Fareed Zakaria GPS'
This week on Fareed Zakaria GPS, Obama plans on pouring billions of dollars and thousands of troops into Afghanistan. Can anyone fix Afghanistan?
Sunday, 1 & 6 p.m. ET see full schedule »
CNN: Does that mean foreign policy takes a back seat? Zakaria: Not a back seat, but if I were advising him, I would suggest that he save his presidential time, energy and political capital for the economy. He will probably need to go to Congress soon and ask for more money and more authority. Now, having said all this, the trouble with foreign policy is that it doesn't wait around for you until the time is convenient. Things happen and you have to react to them -- like the violence in Gaza. That's probably why the president called the foreign leaders he did on his first day -- [Palestinian President Mahmoud] Abbas [Israeli Prime Minister Ehud] Olmert, [Saudi] King Abdullah and [Egyptian President Hosni] Mubarak. He had to make sure that the situation didn't spiral downward. CNN: What's the first major foreign policy problem President Obama should address? Zakaria: Afghanistan. This is his war; the one he said was the right war. And it isn't going well. The Taliban is gaining strength and the central government is losing power and legitimacy. CNN: The Taliban is back? I thought we defeated them. Zakaria: The Taliban was not defeated: They retreated. They retreated into the rural areas of Pakistan. If you remember, the Taliban was born in Pakistan and supported by the Pakistani military as a tool to destabilize Soviet-controlled Afghanistan and India. Since they retreated, they have been able to slowly reassert their influence. Rory Stewart, who was just in Afghanistan, is on our show this week and he mentions that in the past, the Taliban only had a presence in southern Afghanistan. But they now can be found in Kabul. The fact they have such a presence in the capital, an area we considered secure, is very troubling. Don't Miss Interactive map: Global challenges await Obama

Fareed's new book: 'The Post-American World'
'Fareed Zakaria GPS'
CNN: Why are they experiencing this support within the country? Zakaria: There are many reasons. But you have to remember, this is still a very poor country that is very fragmented. Security and the rule of law are missing and the Taliban provides it. Barney Rubin remarked that the first thing the Taliban creates when they go into an area is courts. It may not be the type of justice we would like; but for the Afghans it's better than the corrupt system that exists. Also, we shouldn't assume our image of the Taliban is correct. It is a very dynamic organization and changes. We may need to find a way to negotiate with them. CNN: Negotiate with the group that harbored al Qaeda? Zakaria: It may be a political necessity. Rory Stewart said, "It's not 'what ought we do,' but 'what can we do.'" He argues that at some point, the reality of troops and money will force us to revaluate our goals and we should start that process now. And there are many other crises America must deal with -- Iraq, Pakistan, sub-Saharan Africa, Iran -- so we can't be obsessed with Afghanistan. Barney Rubin added: The question is, whether we can separate the terrorist al Qaeda connections from the political issues of the Taliban. If that can occur, then it may be possible to find a solution in Afghanistan as [Gen. David] Petraeus helped broker in Iraq. We'll have to wait and see what Gen. Petraeus advises the president and what he decides to do. Done in [the president's] spare time, when he's not handling the economy. [Barnett Rubin is one of the nation's foremost experts on Afghanistan and Pakistan and the author of eight books. Rory Stewart, who lives in Kabul, has traveled extensively in Afghanistan and Iraq and written books about his experiences.]

Dempsey: Pakistan-U.S. relations 'a mess'
By Charley Keyes, CNN
updated 10:03 PM EST, Sat December 10, 2011
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Joint Chiefs chairman says NATO attack on border post was not intentional
Pakistan has claimed that attack was planned
U.S. trying to show patience, Adm. Martin Dempsey says
Washington (CNN) -- U.S. relations with Pakistan in the wake of last month's NATO attack on a border post are "a mess," America's highest-ranking officer said Friday.
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, dismissed Pakistani government claims that the attack was planned.
"What I can say, absolutely, and I can't imagine anyone in this room wouldn't believe me: We did not attack a border post, a Pakistan military border post, intentionally," Dempsey said in a speech in Washington. "If you think we did, I'd have to ask you in return, what in the world would we hope to gain by doing that? So I can say that categorically.
"They believe we did this intentionally in some way to either discredit them or goad them into further action," Dempsey said of the Pakistani motivation for making the claim.
The American general said that sometimes, the U.S. is a victim of its own success, with the world overestimating U.S. military capabilities in the midst of the confusion of war.
"The rest of the world sees us as completely all-knowing, all-seeing, completely precise," Dempsey said. "You know, look, warfare is really, when you really get down and touch it, it's just ugly, and it's messy, and it's unpredictable, and it's chaotic, and there's fog, and there's friction."
Dempsey said the U.S.-Pakistan relationship is strained, but the U.S. is giving it time.
"What we're trying to do is show some patience, asking them to show some patience, and then we'll try to get back in touch with each other and see if we can work through it," he said. "But yeah, it is a mess."
Dempsey's unusually strong words and undiplomatic language were echoed at the Pentagon by spokesman George Little.
"This incident was not, I repeat not, a deliberate attack on the Pakistani military by (the International Security Assistance Force)," Little said. "It is wrong to assert that."
And these strong comments are coming from American officials even before the conclusion of the formal investigation into what happened when 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed.
"We know enough at this point to say with certainty this was not an intentional attack on Pakistani forces," Little insisted. "The Pakistanis are our partners. It defies reason that we would attack them."
Little was asked whether Defense Secretary Leon Panetta would agree with Dempsey on U.S.-Pakistan relations.
"It certainly is in a rough patch. You can ask the secretary at some point what term he would use," he said. "But if 'mess' describes a very difficult time in the relationship, the answer is absolutely yes."
Despite the chill in the relationship, the U.S. continues to work in a reduced fashion with Pakistan at special border coordination posts that had been set up to avoid an attack like the deadly one November 25, even though Pakistan had reduced its manpower at the border coordination centers.
Little said those shared posts were still making a difference.
"There have been instances of cooperation since the recent incident," he said. "It is important that they be fully manned so that we avoid similar incidents in the future."
And Dempsey hinted that the U.S. is considering alternatives to supply U.S. troops in Afghanistan if Pakistan continues to block road access through two border crossings.
"We're adapting to some of the things they've done, you know, the closures of the ground lines of communications and so forth," he said. "We're assessing the cost of that. There is a cost."

Witnesses describe use of force outside Sanaa University By the CNN Wire Staff Yemenis continued to protest against the regime of President Ali Abdullah Saleh in Sanaa on Tuesday. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Demonstrations occur in Taiz and Ibb, tooDozens are wounded outside Sanaa University, witnesses sayThe government says guns were being smuggled into a "weapon-free area"Protesters say food and blankets were being taken in

Yemen
Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Dozens of anti-government demonstrators were wounded Tuesday when security forces fired into the air and shot tear gas into a crowd of tens of thousands of protesters who had massed in front of Sanaa University, witnesses said. According to Ala'a Al-Khowlani, at least 40 anti-government demonstrators were wounded and at least one of them was in critical condition. Other witnesses put the total number wounded as high as 67. "Live bullets are being shot -- we do not know from which angle," said Yaser Al-Hasani, one of the demonstrators. "The security forces are using force against us because we are bringing in food into the protest area." Al-Hasani said security forces cracked down after students defied their orders not to take food and blankets into the protest area outside the gates of Sanaa University. The supplies were intended for the thousands of anti-government demonstrators who have camped out in front of the university calling for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down. Al-Khowlani described a similar scene. In a statement e-mailed to reporters, the government blamed the violence on people who had tried to sneak weapons into a "weapon-free area" outside the university, then resisted arrest. "Late Tuesday evening, during a routine police inspection on Al-Hurriya street in Sanaa, police discovered individuals with a stash of fully automatic rifles hidden inside thick blankets and camping equipment," the statement said. "The individuals were attempting to enter the 'weapon-free area' of University Square, where anti-government protesters have been camping for days. "The suspects resisted arrest and soon thereafter a gun fight broke out, injuring dozens of suspected militants, policemen and innocent bystanders. Panic from the shootings set off a raging stampede in the area. There is no official confirmation on casualties at this point." It said early Wednesday that the situation was under control and that the Ministry of Interior would investigate the incident. Tens of thousands of protesters also demonstrated in the city of Taiz and thousands demonstrated in Ibb, witnesses said. Both cities are south of Sanaa. Another demonstration -- this one at Sanaa Central Prison -- erupted Monday evening when inmates gathered in the main hall, said a prisoner who has spoken with CNN in the past. The inmates raised their voices against the government and demanded more rights. Guards fired warning shots and tear gas as prisoners chanted anti-government slogans, according to the prisoner, who obtained access to a phone during the incident and spoke with CNN Tuesday. Guards ordered the prisoners to return to their cells. The inmates refused but dispersed and re-entered their cells after the guards exerted force, the prisoner said. Tuesday morning, they reassembled in the main hall and resumed their protests, the prisoner said. Again, guards responded with tear gas and bullets fired in the air. Two prisoners were killed and seven were wounded, said the prisoner, who did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal from prison guards. Protesters in Yemen been demonstrating for weeks, demanding the ouster of Saleh, who has ruled Yemen since 1978. An Interior Ministry official commented solely on Monday's incident. "Prisoners were causing chaos and security forces had to do what was necessary to keep matters under control," the official told CNN. A government statement said the inmates rioted because they wanted pardons. It acknowledged that riot police had subdued the inmates and said it was investigating the incident. The government said it was beefing up security around Sanaa, the capital, "over terror concerns in the aftermath of multiple terror attacks on security and army personnel." Yemen's anti-government demonstrations are unfolding in a nation wracked by a Shiite Muslim uprising, a U.S.-aided crackdown on al Qaeda operatives and a looming shortage of water. High unemployment fuels much of the anger among a growing and impoverished young population. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom.CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report

Button: U.S. return is important for F1
From Pedro Pinto and Tom McGowan, CNN
updated 8:59 PM EST, Wed November 14, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Jenson Button is looking forward to the first F1 grand prix in the United States since 2007 Former world champion tells CNN the race is important for F1's future development
Button says he has good relationship with departing teammate Lewis Hamilton
Hamilton criticized his fellow Englishman on Twitter earlier this year
(CNN) -- Formula One has yet to win over the United States, but former world champion Jenson Button hopes this weekend's race in Texas will be the start of something big.
The new, purpose-built Circuit of the Americas in Austin will host the first U.S. Grand Prix since 2007 on Sunday -- the penultimate race of the season, and crucial in the drivers' title fight between Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso.
"Racing in Austin is one of the most exciting grands prix," Button told CNN. "It's a purpose-built circuit for Formula One ... it's very important for us to make this work in the States.
"Five years ago we raced, it wasn't the best race but it was on a circuit which wasn't built for Formula One cars, but for IndyCar and NASCAR.

"This was built for Formula One. We're hoping it works. Looking at the layout of the circuit and driving it in the simulator, it's pretty cool. There are lots of corners, heavy breaking, long straights for overtaking. So I've got a feeling it's going to be a good weekend."

While F1 has spread around the world to new markets, it has struggled to touch the heartland of U.S. motorsport's fanbase, which favors open-wheel racing -- generally seen as more accessible for fans and competitors alike.
"Racing here, racing in Austin, a very young, vibrant city, we're hopefully going to get a lot of the youngsters interested in the sport," Button said.
"Not just as spectators, but actually wanting to be involved in the sport in the future."
Button's future in F1 is tied with McLaren for next season, but he will have a new teammate following Lewis Hamilton's decision to join rivals Mercedes.
When Button joined McLaren in 2010 as a newly-crowned world champion, it was hoped he could form an all-British dream partnership with his compatriot.
But after three seasons as teammates neither driver has managed to win the title, and a Twitter row erupted in the aftermath of 2008 champion Hamilton's announcement he will move to the German outfit in 2013.

Hamilton will end a career-long association with McLaren after the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix next weekend, but Button insists the pair still enjoy an amicable professional relationship.

"We have a very good working relationship," Button said.
"We're competitive, as we should be -- you want to beat everyone and that includes your teammate.
"He's extremely fast, he's an extremely talented driver so it makes my life difficult. But I like that, I like that challenge. When we're working together, we share every bit of information, as we should."
Hamilton, who sits fifth in the drivers' standings 12 points and one place above Button, accused his colleague of "unfollowing" him -- unsubscribing to his tweets -- on Twitter after October's Japanese Grand Prix.
"Just noticed @jensonbutton unfollowed, thats a shame. After 3 years as teammates, I thought we respected one another but clearly he doesn't," Hamilton said via his official Twitter account, which has over one million followers.
However, Hamilton, who made his F1 debut with McLaren in 2007, later apologized for the outburst, tweeting: "My bad, just found out Jenson never followed me. Don't blame him! Need to be on Twitter more!"
Read: F1 star Perez gives Mexicans hope
Button's new teammate will be young Mexican Sergio Perez, who has made his name in an impressive second season at Sauber.
"He's obviously an exciting talent," added Button. "He's willing to learn, he seems intelligent, those are the three ingredients you need as a racing driver.
The US Grand Prix at Indianapolis in 2005 was won by Michael Schumacher. But the race is remembered less for his victory, than the number of starters -- just six cars, rather than the normal 20.
A puncture during practice caused Ralf Schumacher's Toyota to crash at the banked final turn -- the fastest part of the track -- sparking the controversy that led to so few cars starting the race.
Toyota used Michelin rubber and, after further investigation into the tire failure, Michelin advised the seven teams who used their tires -- Renault, McLaren, Williams, Toyota, BAR, Sauber and Red Bull -- not to race. At the end of the parade lap, the seven Michelin teams peeled off into the pit lane -- leaving only Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi to contest the race.
"I can clearly recall my heart sinking when one car after another peeled into the pit lane," said BBC commentator Maurice Hamilton. "The fans were incensed -- and rightly so," added Hamilton. "While the mood in the paddock was a mix of bewilderment, silent anger and resignation."
With motorsport fans left feeling so shortchanged it nearly drove Formula One out of the U.S. for good.
When the contract for the U.S. GP expired at the end of 2007, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone chose not to renew his deal with Indianapolis for the following season.
In 2002 Michael Schumacher suggested he had conceded victory at Indianapolis to his then teammate Rubens Barrichello as a gesture of thanks after he had overtaken the Brazilian under Ferrari team orders to win the Austrian GP.
The forthcoming U.S. Grand Prix in Austin, Texas will be the first F1 race to be held in the country since 2007.

F1's strangest race?
Sergio "Checo" Perez has been the surprise package of the 2012 Formula One season -- just his second year in the elite division of motorsport. Perez's second place at the Malaysian GP in March was the Mexican's first podium finish in F1. He followed that up with third in Canada and another runner-up position in Italy. After Lewis Hamilton (left) opted to join Mercedes for the 2013 season, McLaren signed Perez to partner Jenson Button (right) next year.
"Bear in mind that when we took on Lewis he was the same age as Sergio is today and he was incredibly young, incredibly raw and incredibly talented," said McLaren Team Principal Martin Whitmarsh. "Now when Sergio gets to Australia in 2013 he will arrive with the kind of pressure that he can't imagine right now."
Seen here driving in an exhibition through the streets of his home city Guadalajara, Perez was already winning kart races by the age of six.
Manchester United forward Javier Hernandez was also born in Guadalajara -- and Perez is close friends with the footballer, whose nickname is "Chicharito."
Mexico is embroiled in a battle against drugs, which in the last six years has accounted for 60,000 deaths, with 16,000 bodies remaining unidentified and 24,000 people missing. "My country is really only in the media for drugs and violence, which is sad," said Perez.
Perez's father, center, leaves the paddock after the F1 driver's crash during qualifying for the Monaco GP in 2011. Perez's younger brother Antonio is also involved in motorsport and drives in the NASCAR-sponsored race league in Mexico.
When Perez joined Sauber he was sponsored by telecommunications giant Telmex, which is owned by world's richest man and fellow Mexican Carlos Slim.
Ahead of this weekend's U.S. Grand Prix, the penultimate race of 2012, Perez was 10th in the drivers' standings with 66 points.

Formula One 2012: The circuits
"He's only 22, which is quite scary. He's 10 years younger than me which makes me feel very old! I'm looking forward to the partnership. It's a fresh start and it's exciting."
Button has won two races this season, in Australia and Belgium, and finished on the podium another three times.
However, last season's runner-up has been frustrated by his inability to challenge both Red Bull's current leader and two-time defending champion Vettel, and Ferrari's Alonso -- who, like the German, is seeking a third world title.
"It's been a tough year," Button said. "You've got to love the wins. The two wins for me were pretty special, but I've also had some pretty bad races.
"I sorted those issues out, but I'd lost so much ground by then it's difficult to fight for the championship. The last few races have been fun, I've really enjoyed it.
"There's been a massive amount of competition between the top four or five teams so the sport's in a great place. It is the best the sport has been for many years, so it's the best time to come back to America and see if it works.
"The racing is great, we've got a lot of top drivers, a lot of top teams, great partners and sponsors involved -- it should work."

Airport dating: Love at first flight?
By Eoghan Macguire, for CNN
updated 8:47 AM EST, Tue November 27, 2012
A couple kiss at Barajas airport in Madrid.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Website helps travelers connect with each other at airports
The site was founded in 2011 and has 20,000 members worldwide, its founder claims One expert claims airport dating may struggle to take-off beside other dating concepts
(CNN) -- When a delayed flight left Steve Pasternack stranded at Miami Airport in early 2011, he settled into his departure lounge seat and cast a curious eye across his fellow passengers.
"I noticed a lot of people at the bar looking for something to do," he says, "and I thought it'd be great if I could get them to meet each other."
A web entrepreneur by trade, Pasternack resolved to create Meetattheairport.com -- a dating website that enables travelers to connect at the departure gate.
Since launching in May 2011 the platform has attracted roughly 20,000 members worldwide, he claims.
The concept works by prompting users to enter their personal interests, flight details and departure airport before matching them up with individuals with similar interests and travel arrangements.
So far people in the United States, Mexico and Germany have shown the most interest, although Pasternack says members have joined from all over the world.
What better time to meet somebody new than when you're sitting in an airport?Steve Pasternack, Meetattheairport.com
"What better time to meet somebody new than when you're sitting in an airport?" he asks.
"This person could be a travel companion [or] they could be from the place you're going. It could turn into a friendship, a romance. It could work out for business, many things."

Although somewhat of a pioneer in this field, Pasternack is not alone in exploring the possibility of transforming airports into social meeting places.
Vantaa Airport in Helsinki, Finland, recently considered the possibility of introducing an airport speed-dating service.
According to Rachel Greenwald, dating strategist and author of the book "Have Him at Hello," these ideas are a natural progression of the popular niche-dating site concept.
Since first coming to prominence in the mid-90s, online dating has exploded in popularity, becoming increasingly specialized in the last five years or so, Greenwald says.
A report from web-business industry body Subscription Site Insider found that more than 25 million people registered for online dating sites globally in April 2011 alone.
"[There are now] dating sites for wine lovers, tall people ... there's also another which connects people on their book tastes," Greenwald says.
"[Many] young professionals in their 20s and 30s are constantly traveling as they build their careers," she says. "They simply don't have time to date when they're at home, so this [airport dating] could be very efficient."

But while curious as to how the concept develops, Greenwald cautions that ideas like airport dating will likely be inhibited by the same factors that limit online dating.
Airport dating still isn't solving the underlying problem of online dating which is that it can't predict chemistryRachel Greenwald
This includes their impersonal nature and the idea that pairing individuals with similar interests is all it takes to make a good match, rather than personal chemistry between two people, she says.
There is also the degree of blind trust required to accept that the person on the other end of an email chain really is who they say they are.
While recognizing this risk, Pasternack argues there are few safer places to personalize a blossoming online relationship than in the tightly policed environs of an airport.

Greenwald agrees, although she points out that Meetattheairport may still struggle to compete with other modern dating platforms -- such as group dinner dates or theater trips -- which provide earlier face-to-face meetings.
"Airport dating still isn't solving the underlying problem of online dating, which is that it can't predict chemistry," she says.
Until sites can master this concept, airport daters will be choosing who they meet on "two-dimensional impressions based on a photo and some words ... rather than three-dimensional personal chemistry."

Revealed: Disgraced TV star's charm offensive with ex-PM Margaret Thatcher
By Dave Gilbert, CNN
updated 7:57 AM EST, Fri January 11, 2013
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pictured in 1980 with TV host Jimmy Savile.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Hand-written letter from UK National Arhives shows Jimmy Savile's admiration for Margaret Thatcher
Savile asked Thatcher if the government would consider a grant for the hospital as "goodwill gesture"
National Archives papers also show that the UK's former prime minister was surprised by the invasion of the Falkland Islands
"It was such a stupid thing to do," Thatcher told a Falklands war review committee
London (CNN) -- Disgraced TV star Jimmy Savile lobbied former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for government money to help fund a hospital unit, newly released archive documents reveal.
UK TV host Savile died last year aged 84 but police are now investigating claims of sexual abuse during his long broadcasting career, saying they are dealing with about 300 apparent victims -- mostly girls who were in their mid-teens at the time.
Who was Jimmy Savile?
The papers released Friday include a hand-written note thanking the then prime minster for a lunch invitation and shows Savile's familiarity with, and admiration for Margaret Thatcher.
"My girl patients pretended to be madly jealous and wanted to know what you wore and what you ate," Savile writes, adding: "They all love you. Me too!!"
In 1980 Savile was trying to raise £10 million ($16 million) for Stoke Mandeville Hospital and asked Thatcher's advice about tax deductions for charity.
Report: Savile a 'prolific' sex offender
Savile's years of abuse
TV icon sex abuse scandal rocks the BBC Anniversary of Falklands War marked She wrote back to express her own interest in the subject and later to inform him that the rules for charity donations had been changed in the budget, explaining that "the period for which covenants to charity must be capable of running is being reduced from seven years to four so that people will no longer have to commit themselves to such a long time."
Documents released by the UK's National Archives further reveal that they met on several occasions. A note from a prime minister's aide shows that in 1981 Savile asked her if the government would consider a grant for the hospital as a "goodwill gesture" to all the people who had donated.
Subsequent memos demonstrate that government advisers were sensitive about a financial commitment and pressed the prime minister to let them know if she had made Savile a promise about offering money for Stoke Mandeville or agreed to appear on his TV show "Jim'll fix it."

The government eventually agreed to give £500,000 ($800,000) to help rebuild the hospital's spinal injuries unit.
Other documents released Friday under the UK's 30-year rule detail the handling of the conflict in the southern Atlantic in 1982 after Argentina invaded the Falklands Islands.
Testimony in the archive reveals Thatcher's surprise at the invasion, describing it as "the worst... moment of my life."
In evidence given to the Falkland Islands Review Committee in October 1982, and some months after the war ended, Thatcher said there were no warning signs from Argentina since its 1977 statement saying there would be talks.
"I never, never expected the Argentines to invade the Falklands head-on," she told the committee. "It was such a stupid thing to do, as events happened, such a stupid thing even to contemplate doing.
"I saw on March 3 that we must make contingency plans. Even then I did not think it would happen. The first time that I actually realized was on the Wednesday before... but I never believed that they would invade," the released papers quote her as saying.

The files also show that Thatcher's cabinet was trying to pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis through the help of then U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, whilst also preparing a military response.
Thatcher made clear that the UK government would negotiate with Argentina but that "the immediate requirement was for Argentine troops to leave the Falkland Islands and for British administration to be restored. The prime minister added that she would be "guided by the wishes of the islanders."
Documents show the UK government also refused to give an undertaking that the military task force (at that time on its way to the south Atlantic) would be halted "much less turned back" during a period of any Argentine military withdrawal.

15 biggest souvenir-buying no-no's
By Chuck Thompson, CNN
updated 2:18 AM EST, Fri February 8, 2013
Travelers stick family and friends with untold zillions of worthless or gratuitous gifts each year, but almost nothing good ever gets done at the last minute. The first rule of souvenir shopping? No buying gifts at the airport. Ever.
No plush or inflatable gifts for anyone over three years old. You're better than that.
No leftover foreign coins as "souvenirs" or collectibles. This is worse than giving nothing, because it shows how lazy you are.
No athletic jerseys, caps or visors. Especially visors. And Beckham. And Messi.
No exotic alcohol. Funky label or not, that local rotgut is a hoot when you're in country, undrinkable everywhere else.
No Eiffel Towers, Statues of Liberties, Mt. Rushmores, Taj Mahals, Aussie koalas, Chairman Maos or anything that would fit perfectly in the back of a closet or bottom of a drawer.
No key chains, coasters, mugs or plates. And, whatever you do, no double-whammy Eiffel Tower key chains. No more little bags of rock, black, sea or flavored salt. The whole designer salt thing is done.
No bottles filled with sand, coral bits, shells or pebbles. No items that require assembly, watering, sunlight, maintenance, lubrication or refrigeration. Or excessive explanation.
No "I (heart)" anything. Even if you do.
No books. We believe you, it was an amaaaaaazing art exhibit. We just don't have 37 hours to spend reading about it.
No traditional ethnic clothing for non-ethnics.
No items you wouldn't want to get or wouldn't proudly display in your own home.
No plastic leis.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Don't guilt family and friends into hanging on to gifts you wouldn't want
Avoid shopping at the airport
Plush toys and designer sea salt are out
Are you really sure they want that scorpion alcohol?
Hong Kong (CNN) -- It's an essential part of any trip, an activity we all take part in.
Yet almost none of us are any good at it.
Souvenir buying -- instead of being an enjoyable part of the travel experience, it too often becomes an obligatory slog.
The global economy for ill-conceived souvenir purchases is staggering.
In 2012 alone, travelers spent a total of US$2.3 billion on souvenirs that were subsequently ignored, unused, unappreciated, unworn, discarded, disliked, ridiculed and/or stuffed in bottom drawers and backs of closets never to be seen again.
Worse, travelers wasted 427 million aggregated hours fretting over the purchases of pointless doodads, knickknacks, tchotchkes, gewgaws and dust gatherers.
OK, we made all those figures up, but given all the "Singapore is a Fine City" T-shirts, Chairman Mao cigarette lighters, plush koalas and inflatable jumbo airplanes cluttering the CNN Travel office, we're pretty sure people spend a lot of money and time on desperation purchases that unfairly burden recipients with the obligation of hanging on to these dubious prizes for years to come.
The good news is that it's easy to improve your souvenir-buying savvy.
Avoid the common shopping mistakes above and your family, friends and coworkers might actually start looking forward to your return home for a change.

Denmark wins Eurovision Song Contest By Laura Smith-Spark, CNN
updated 8:19 AM EDT, Mon May 20, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Emmelie de Forest's "Only Teardrops" puts Denmark on top
Azerbaijan finishes second and Ukraine takes third
The contest is taking place in Sweden this year because it won in 2012
The results are decided on the basis of votes cast by TV viewers and national juries
London (CNN) -- Emmelie de Forest carried Denmark to triumph early Sunday in the Eurovision Song Contest, an annual musical spectacle known for its combination of over-the-top costumes, kitsch pop songs and international rivalries.
Flanked by marching drummers in military-style uniforms and performing in bare feet, de Forest took top spot with a breathy performance of "Only Teardrops."
Millions of people across Europe and beyond tuned in to watch pop acts from 26 countries take to the stage in the Swedish city of Malmo. Dressed like a new-age Tinker Bell, 20-year-old de Forest bested a field that included the UK contender and 1980s hit-maker Bonnie Tyler.
Azerbaijan's Farid Mammadov finished second with the song "Hold Me," and the Ukraine's Zlata Ognevich took third with "Gravity."
What is Eurovision?
British pop icon: 'Got my revenge'
'Hold Me Now' by Johnny Logan
Tyler, known for her hits "Total Eclipse of the Heart" and "Holding Out for a Hero," finished in 19th place.
Organizers expected more than 100 million people to tune in for the contest, hosted by Sweden -- the 2012 winner of the song contest.
Demark was considered one of the favorites among bookmakers going into the final on Saturday night.
Five nations -- France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom -- get an automatic entry to the final because they are the biggest financial contributors. The previous year's winner also automatically qualifies, as the host nation.
The 39 countries involved in the contest awarded a set of points from one to eight, then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs. Under the rules, they can't vote for themselves and they must announce the score in both English and French.
The crazy clothes of Eurovision
Television viewers also cast votes in their respective countries through telephone hotlines, which count for half the final tally. The remainder of the vote is cast by national expert juries, who based their scores on a dress rehearsal performance Friday night.
Many perceive the voting to be tactical, with neighbors or members of regional blocs, such as the former Soviet nations, appearing to base their scoring on geopolitical alliances rather than artistic merit.
Contestants can come from any member country of the European Broadcasting Union, which includes several non-European nations, including Israel, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Victory may not be welcomed by everyone back home since that nation bears the expense of hosting the following year's event -- a commitment that's more of a burden at a time of wide austerity in Europe.

Kickstarter: 'We were wrong' about men's guide to women
By CNN Staff
updated 3:48 PM EDT, Sun June 23, 2013 | Kickstarter has taken down Ken Hoinsky's crowd-funding project page after a critical online petition.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Guide to "getting awesome with women" went too far, website says
Critics call it a guide for would-be rapists
Author says his message is being distorted
(CNN) -- "We were wrong."
With that, Kickstarter said Friday that it had erred in not moving quickly to remove from its website a request for money for a book that critics described as a guide for would-be rapists.
In a statement addressed to "Dear everybody" and signed "Kickstarter," the website apologized and sought to explain.
It said that on Wednesday morning, it received a blog post that quoted "disturbing material" found on Reddit that was taken from a draft for a "seduction guide." The guide's writer was using the crowd-funding website to raise $2,000 to get his work published.

"The posts offended a lot of people -- us included -- and many asked us to cancel the creator's project," the statement said. "We didn't. We were wrong."
Two factors influenced the decision, the statement said.
"We had only two hours from when we found out about the material to when the project was ending. We've never acted to remove a project that quickly.
"Our processes, and everyday thinking, bias heavily toward creators. This is deeply ingrained. We feel a duty to our community -- and our creators especially -- to approach these investigations methodically as there is no margin for error in canceling a project. This thinking made us miss the forest for the trees."
Entrepreneurs routinely use Kickstarter to get funding for their ideas and gadgets.
While the effort to publish a book on "getting awesome with women" raked in more than $16,000, it also attracted allegations that it is a guide to sexual assault.
Kickstarter to users: Backer beware
Author Ken Hoinsky describes his work as a book for men seeking advice on interacting with women.
"It is a guide for men to get better with women," he says in a video that was on Kickstarter but has since been taken down.
In one excerpt, he writes: "The concept of 'waiting for signs' or 'indicators of interest' was commonplace in older pickup theory. It is 100% garbage and needs to be erased from the face of the planet."
"From now on you must assume that she is attracted to you and wants to be ravished," it continues. "Physically pick her up and sit her on your lap. Don't ask for permission. Be dominant. Force her to rebuff your advances."
Such comments led some 50,000 people to sign an online petition criticizing Kickstarter for having hosted the project and demanding that the company take it down.
" 'Disgusting' doesn't even begin to describe it: basically, it's a how-to guide on sexually assaulting women," the petition states.

Kickstarter initially defended its inaction.
"Some of this material is abhorrent and inconsistent with our values as people and as an organization," it said Wednesday in a statement. "Based on our current guidelines, however, the material on Reddit did not warrant the irreversible action of canceling the project."
But its Friday statement was contrite: "Let us be 100% clear: Content promoting or glorifying violence against women or anyone else has always been prohibited from Kickstarter," it said.
"If a project page contains hateful or abusive material we don't approve it in the first place. If we had seen this material when the project was submitted to Kickstarter (we didn't), it never would have been approved. Kickstarter is committed to a culture of respect."
Agents racing to save girl from rapist had one blurred clue
The website said it could not take the money back from Hoinsky. "We missed the window," it said.
But the website has taken down his project page and, beginning immediately, "we are prohibiting 'seduction guides,' or anything similar," it said.
In an interview with CNN sister station HLN, Hoinsky called Kickstarter's decision "a wise PR move," but added, "a blanket ban on all men's dating advice is going too far. We need public dialogue, not censorship, if we're going to solve this problem.
"Perception is reality. And thanks to a handful of influential sites sensationalizing a story by using quotes out of context, the perception is that they supported a rape guide. Those who take the time to understand my message know that's not the case. But that doesn't matter, the damage is done."
He had earlier explained his writings this way: "The gist of the controversial advice is, 'Don't wait for signs before you make your move. Let her be the one who rejects your advances. If she says no, stop immediately and tell her you don't want to do anything that would make her uncomfortable.'"
The website said it was donating $25,000 to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. "Kickstarter is one of the friendliest, most supportive places on the web and we're committed to keeping it that way," the statement said. "We're sorry for getting this so wrong."

New iPads expected at event next week
By Heather Kelly, CNN
updated 6:46 AM EDT, Wed October 16, 2013 | Filed under: Mobile
Apple included this image with its invitation to a company press event October 22 in San Francisco.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Apple sends out invites for an October 22 press event
The company is expected to announce upgraded iPad and iPad Minis
There could also be some Mac news, including a release date for OS X Mavericks
(CNN) -- As foretold by tech bloggers and Apple's own not-so-subtle habit of holding an event every October, Apple has sent out invites for a press conference next week.
The company is expected to announce updates to its iPad line, including an iPad Mini with a higher resolution display. In addition to some speed improvements, the fifth-generation iPad is expected to get a new slimmed-down design.
The event will be held at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, one of the larger venues Apple regularly uses for its product launches.
The show will start at 10 a.m. PT on October 22. It will probably follow the usual pattern of CEO Tim Cook showing off recent stats before bringing up other executives to introduce the various new products.
Burberry CEO to join Apple 'I'm the original voice of Siri'
Live demonstrations and videos are typically sprinkled throughout to pad out the event.
Electronics companies hold fall events to get their wares on store shelves in time for the holiday rush, which is when they make a large chunk of their annual sales profit.
Apple's e-mail invite says the company has "a lot" to cover, and it is expected to announce more than just an upgrade to its iPad line.
The new Mac operating system, Mac OS X Mavericks, was previewed earlier this year and is due for a fall release. The redesigned Mac Pro, a professional level desktop computer with a slick new circular design, is also likely to get some stage time and a release date.
Other Mac products could receive the upgrade treatment, including MacBook Pros.
There is always the chance Apple could toss in some bigger surprises, such as upgrades to Apple TV or the debut of Apple's smart watch. However, recent announcements have aligned closely with the rumor mill, and the company hasn't been able to sneak in a real surprise in a while.

From herbs to acupuncture: Journal explores effectiveness of alternative medicine

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Citing the rising popularity of alternative medicine, the American Medical Association on Tuesday released a series of studies testing the effectiveness of some common treatments.
Journal researchers reported that in 1997, four out of 10 Americans used alternative medicines, spending an estimated $21.2 billion. The survey included practices such as spiritual healing, massage, chiropractic care, homeopathy and acupuncture.
U.S. alternative medicine visits increased from an estimated 427 million in 1990 to 629 million in 1997, the survey found. By comparison, visits to all U.S. primary care physicians in 1997 totaled 386 million.
"The market for alternative medicine is vast and growing," said study author Dr. David Eisenberg of Beth-Israel Deaconess in Boston. "This trend must be guided by scientific inquiry, clinical judgment, regulatory authority and shared decision-making."
Researchers say very few patients discuss alternative therapies with their doctors
Journal not alone in questioning practice
The Journal of the American Medical Association is the second major medical journal to tackle the topic of alternative medicine in recent months. In September, the New England Journal of Medicine cautioned patients against using alternative treatments that were not adequately researched and tested.
JAMA studies found that while some traditional therapies are helpful, others show no measurable health benefits.
Doctors in Italy and China said moxibustion, the application of heat from burning herbs to acupuncture points, can help a fetus in breech position to turn head-down when the treatment is administered to a pregnant woman.
A breech position occurs when a fetus is in a position other than headfirst, sometimes causing the buttocks, legs or feet, instead of the head, to emerge first in delivery. It can be dangerous for both mother and child.
The study's authors said, "If the results of this trial are confirmed, moxibustion should be extensively used on account of its noninvasiveness, low cost and ease of execution."
Another treatment, using Chinese herbs to treat irritable bowel syndrome, can reduce pain and irregularity, said researchers from the University of Western Sydney in Australia.
Some treatments fall short
The Obesity Research Center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York looked at Garcinia cambogia, an herb often used for weight loss. "The herbal product Garcinia cambogia failed to produce significantly more weight loss than a placebo tablet," said the study's author, Dr. Steve Heymesfield.
The reports said at least 14 products containing hydroxycitric acid, the active ingredient in Garcinia cambogia, are currently available to consumers over the counter.
Researchers at the Odense University in Denmark said spinal manipulation does not improve tension headaches that affect more than one-third of the population and account for more than two-thirds of all headaches.
Alternative medicine says it supports research
Practitioners of alternative therapies say they welcome the research.
"In the future, we should try and find a combination that would work," said Nadav Shraibom of the Pacific Institute of Oriental Medicine. "Find a place that the Western medicine is at and try to make things (work) together."
Before the two fields can work together, researchers say, there's much more to learn, and communication is key.
They say very few people discuss their use of alternative therapies with their doctors. "Fewer than 40 percent of the alternative therapies are discussed with one's physician," Eisenberg said. "In my personal view, the current status quo which could easily be described as 'Don't ask and don't tell,' needs to be abandoned -- that is not in anyone's best interest."
Medical Correspondent Dr. Steve Salvatore and Reuters contributed to this report.

Making streaming media useful
October 22, 1999
Web posted at: 10:44 a.m. EDT (1444 GMT)
by Nicholas Petreley, InfoWorld columnist From...
(IDG) -- The Internet is a wonderful hybrid medium, isn't it? It's a shame that we still tend to think inside the box when it comes to publishing content on the Web. For example, many Web publications still treat the Internet as if it is the electronic equivalent of a print magazine, although that's been getting better over the last couple of years.

Computerworld Minute Likewise, I can see that some sites are stuck in the age of television when it comes to streaming video. Streaming video on the Internet isn't very popular yet as a medium for obvious reasons. As long as the pipes are limited, it can only aspire to give you the kind of multimedia experience you get from television. But streaming video over the Internet offers some things you can't get from television -- flexibility being the most important. For one thing, if you miss a television event and fail to set your VCR to record it, there's no telling when you'll get another chance to see it. It could be a matter of hours or a matter of months. However, if it is an Internet broadcast, chances are good that you can view it anytime you want. That's the first obvious advantage: the ability to view what you want when you want. But some sites don't even get this concept yet. For example, take www.drgenescott.org. I enjoy listening to some of Dr. Gene Scott's lectures, and I can now get to them over the Internet. However, I don't tune in very often because the site does everything wrong. First of all, the broadcast is billed as live, but it's no more than a streaming version of the television broadcast. The television broadcast is almost always just a series of reruns of the previous lectures. This totally ignores the power of the Internet. What I want to do is pick the topic or lecture. But what I get is whatever happens to be on. Just like television. Only worse. Because you get the broadcast with the abysmal quality of streaming video. The site www.linux4u.com, on the other hand, is a good example of what you get when you do it right. This site -- sponsored by VA Linux Systems, Red Hat, and Linuxcare -- hosts a number of seminars you can view with RealNetworks' Real Player. So far, www.linux4u.com has hosted talks by Tim O'Reilly, of O'Reilly and Associates; Jon "Maddog" Hall, executive director of Linux International; Jeremy Allison, co-creator of Samba; and analysts Dan Kusnetzk at IDC and Greg Weiss at DH Brown. Naturally, you get to pick which speaker you want to watch. I had been meaning to visit this site, but, as you may have figured out from the description above, I'm not yet a big fan of streaming video. So, when I finally got around to it, I planned to watch only a couple of minutes of one of the presentations -- just enough to get an idea of what they are like. Instead, I eventually browsed through all of them. It wasn't the content that held my interest. Don't get me wrong. The introduction is professionally done, and these folks are excellent speakers. But these aren't the kinds of seminars that hold my attention. They're designed more for IT managers who don't fully understand the origins or value of open-source software. Nevertheless, I was fascinated enough to browse through all of the talks because the producer of the material understood the medium. When you run one of these seminars, not only do you get the talking head in the Real Player, but you also get a mini slide show in the browser. There are only a half-dozen slides for each seminar, and they're not terribly interesting. But it's not the number of slides or the information that matters. What impressed me is that you can click on any slide topic, and the Real Player will automatically advance or rewind to that portion of the talk. The slides function as place markers, which is a clever and useful idea. I'm still not a big fan of streaming video. The video usually doesn't add enough to the presentation to keep your visual attention, but it's sometimes useful to leave a Real Player running in the background and lend it an ear. But, I have a feeling we haven't even scratched the surface of what's possible. If you designed a site that included streaming media technology, what would you do differently from what you've seen?
