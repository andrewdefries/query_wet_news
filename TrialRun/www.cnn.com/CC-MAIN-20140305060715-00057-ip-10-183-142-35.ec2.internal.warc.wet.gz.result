NEW YORK (CNN/Money) -- As she faces possible jail time, Martha Stewart invoked the name of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's persecuted anti-apartheid hero, saying: "Many, many good people have gone to prison."Her declaration came in a TV interview taped hours after the homemaking diva was sentenced to five months in prison and two years' probation Friday for lying to investigators about her sale of ImClone Systems stock in late 2001.Federal Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum also ordered Stewart to serve five months of home confinement after her release and fined the lifestyle expert $30,000.The sentence was the minimum the judge could impose under federal sentencing guidelines. The fine, while relatively small given Stewart's wealth, was the maximum allowed under federal rules.Hours later, Peter Bacanovic, Stewart's former broker at Merrill Lynch, also was sentenced to five months in prison and two years' probation; he was fined $4,000.Neither Stewart nor Bacanovic will be headed to prison anytime soon, however. The judge issued a stay delaying their sentences until a court rules on their expected appeals, a process that could take nine months or longer.Stewart, in a pre-recorded interview aired Friday night on ABC's 20/20, was asked by Barbara Walters how she would cope with prison life, including strip searches, if she loses her appeal."I could do it," Stewart said. "I'm a really good camper. I can sleep on the ground. ... There are many, many good people who have gone to prison ... look at Nelson Mandela."Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years before emerging to lead the African National Congress, the liberation party he led to victory in South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994.Stewart, who has been steadfast in proclaiming her innocence, told Walters, "I didn't cheat the little people. ... We're all little people. I didn't cheat anybody out of anything."Bacanovic was accused of ordering his assistant to tell Stewart that the CEO of ImClone Systems was selling all his company stock ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's rejection of the firm's new cancer drug, causing the stock price to plunge.Stewart sold nearly 4,000 shares, and later argued she and Bacanovic had an agreement that he would sell her shares once the price dipped below $60 a share.Stewart said she was sorely disappointed at her sentence, but felt Cedarbaum was fair.She wrote Cedarbaum a four-page letter before her sentencing in which she asked the judge to "consider all the good that I have done, all the contributions I have made and all the intense suffering that has accompanied every single moment of the past two and a half years.""I had hoped for, at the most, some confinement, community service," Stewart told Walters. "And instead I have five months of incarceration, and five months of house arrest that's monitored. ... But it could have been worse. ... Five months versus 10 months or 16 months ... That's a good thing."Stewart said she's angry over the two-year-long legal drama that forced her to give up her self-made, multimedia empire. "Many, many people have suffered. People have lost jobs. I am very saddened and very, very sorry for that.""There are certain people who I wish I'd never met. I have lost my job. I have lost my position in my company. I am no longer the CEO of Martha Stewart Omnimedia. ... That makes me angry and sad."Stewart appeared outside the courthouse after she was sentenced and expressed regret, but she also pledged, "I'll be back."In her first live interview, Stewart will appear on Larry King Live Monday.Stewart's attorneys have 10 days to file their motion to overturn her conviction last March on obstructing justice, conspiracy and making false statements during an insider trading investigation into her sale of $228,000 worth of ImClone Systems (IMCL: Research, Estimates) stock in December 2001.During the sentencing Robert Morvillo, Stewart's lead trial attorney, asked that if Stewart eventually does go to prison, she be sent to a federal facility in Danbury, Conn. Judge Cedarbaum said she would refer the matter to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.The Stewart case is one of a number of criminal indictments that prosecutors have brought against corporate executives in recent years.While comparatively small in terms of the dollars at stake and the gravity of the crime, Stewart's obstruction of justice case has been a powerful public relations vehicle for government officials to send the broad message that corporate malfeasance will not be tolerated.From the start, Stewart's supporters have argued that prosecutors unfairly singled Stewart out because of her power and high public profile.Some legal experts countered that Stewart has only herself to blame for trying to cover up her ImClone stock sale."Her greatest wounds have been self-inflicted," said Marvin Pickholz, who represented Douglas Faneuil, the former assistant to Stewart's broker and the government's star witness at trial.'Shameful day'Throughout the two-and-a-half-year ordeal, Stewart has been defiant and her lawyers have been criticized for pursuing red herrings in an effort to clear her name. Wearing a dark pant suit, she arrived at the courthouse early Friday accompanied by her daughter and son-in-law.Before her sentencing, Stewart read Cedarbaum a statement saying, "I seek the opportunity to repair the damage wrought by the situation, to get on with what I have always thought was a good, worthwhile, and exemplary life."My hopes that my life will not be completely destroyed lie entirely in your competent and experienced and merciful hands. Thank you and peace be with you."Soon after her 30-minute hearing ended, however, Stewart was back on the offensive. Appearing before television cameras outside the courthouse, Martha called it a "shameful day.""What was a small personal matter became, over the last two years, an almost-fatal circus of unprecedented proportion," she said."I have been choked and almost suffocated to death," she said, adding she's "not afraid whatsoever" of what's to come."I'll be back," she declared. Standing next to her was Walter Dellinger, the former acting solicitor general in the Clinton Administration. Dellinger, considered a top-notch appellate lawyer, will now take over Stewart's defense.Stewart also urged people to show their support by subscribing to her magazine, buying her products and telling advertisers to return. (Full text of statement).At Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia headquarters in midtown Manhattan, employees -- who said they were told not to speak to reporters -- told CNN they had a "surreal feeling" when they heard the sentence.Since Stewart's indictment two years ago, the health of her company has deteriorated. Some 200 employees have lost their jobs as advertisers have fled the flagship magazine and paid circulation has dropped.But investors cheered Friday thanks to her relatively light sentence, and shares of Martha Stewart Living (MSO: up $3.17 to $11.81, Research, Estimates) soared 36.7 percent. In response to the dual sentences, legal experts said Friday that they were not surprised by either their lengths or the fact that both Stewart and Bacanovic received similar punishments.Experts described Cedarbaum as a level-headed judge not known to dole out harsh sentences.Also weighing in their favor is the fact that this is their first real brush with the law. "I am sure there are lots of good things that people are saying about both of them," added Michael Proctor, a former federal public defender."These are two first-time offenders, and there's very little chance of either of them being a repeat offender."As for Stewart, "the judge probably felt that, given the loss of status and the impact on her business, that this punishment was fair and just," said Stanley Twardy Jr., a former Connecticut U.S. attorney.Legal experts said that, although the post-trial turmoil involving a juror and the government witness makes for a stronger appeal, Stewart's chances of convincing a court to overturn her conviction are slim. Appeals courts are typically reluctant to set aside jury verdicts.Proctor estimated it could take nine months to two years before a higher court rules on Stewart's appeal.He called Cedarbaum's decision to let her stay out of jail pending the appeal's outcome "a very big victory" for the defense, because it avoided the prospect of Stewart serving her time before an appeals court had a chance to rule."Without the stay, her appeal would have been meaningless," said Proctor, now a partner with Caldwell, Leslie, Newcombe & Pettit in Los Angeles.If Stewart's appeal fails, the Federal Bureau of Prisons will assign her to a prison. For her home detention, Stewart will be confined to her sprawling Bedford, N.Y., estate.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for $1.99

CNN Student News
Ten Questions: April 14
Learning Activity: The crisis in Darfur
In Depth: Darfur
In-Depth: Olympics - Countdown 2008 THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. MONICA LLOYD, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, everyone. We hope you had a good weekend and hope you're ready to get started on a new week of CNN Student News. From the CNN Center, I'm Monica Lloyd. First Up: Global Day for Darfur LLOYD: First up today, we're focusing on the conflict taking place in the Darfur region of Sudan. The United Nations calls this the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. According to the U.N., more than 200,000 people have been killed by the fighting, and at least two million people have been forced to leave their homes. People and organizations around the world are working to raise awareness about the situation and end the fighting. Yesterday marked the "Global Day for Darfur." Emily Chang shows us how activists and survivors commemorated the event in London. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMILY CHANG, CNN REPORTER: Children dropping off postcards at the Sudanese embassy in London. ROA HASSAN, DARFUR SURVIVOR: We're here today to tell the Sudanese embassy they need to stop the war in Darfur, the conflict and the raping too. CHANG: On the postcards, drawings of what the children say are their memories from Darfur: Women and children fleeing gun-toting rebels, houses burning, dead bodies. HASSAN: I witnessed dead bodies on the street, children fleeing from gunshots and air forces dropping bombs down. CHANG: This little girl was lucky enough to escape with her mother. IKHLASS MOHAMED, DARFUR SURVIVOR: Our people, they are suffering a lot. They kill, they buried alive, they burned. CHANG: This is one of several protests being staged around the world to mark the 5th anniversary of war in Darfur, a war protesters say shows no signs of stopping. Fighting broke out in February 2003 when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms against the Arab-dominated Sudanese government, complaining of decades of neglect. The government is accused of unleashing violent militias on rebel groups, but government officials have denied involvement. PROTESTERS: Protect the children of Darfur! Protect the children of Darfur! SOPHIE MCCANN, PROTESTER: We have children who have known nothing but war and violence and atrocity, and they're living on humanitarian aid. CHANG: Matt Damon, Thandie Newton and other celebrities are the latest to participate in a new television campaign to raise awareness about the children who are suffering. George Clooney has spoken publicly about the conflict for years. In advance of this year's global protests, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown offered to hold peace talks GORDON BROWN, BRITISH PM: All rebel groups as well as the government must go to these talks. And secondly, there has got to be a ceasefire, and the violence on all sides has got to stop. CHANG: As Darfur and the world wait for the international community to take action, the Sudan's smallest survivors watch their country being torn apart from afar. Emily Chang, CNN, London. (END VIDEO CLIP) Promo LLOYD: If you want to help your students learn more about Sudan and the conflict in Darfur, check out the Learning Activity on our Web site. It allows students to research the African nation and examine the roles of the Sudanese government, the U.N., and the international community in Darfur. You can find the resource at CNNStudentNews.com. Olympic Charter LLOYD: We've been talking a lot about the Olympics recently and the war of words between China, the host country, and protesters who are speaking out against China. Each side says the Olympic Charter supports its argument. But what does the document actually say, and why is it such an important part of this dispute? Josh Levs has some of the answers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSH LEVS, CNN REPORTER: A heated dispute over China hosting the Olympics; the different sides keep pointing to this: SEN. SHERROD BROWN, (D) OHIO: The Olympic Charter. JIANG YU, SPOKESWOMAN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY: The Olympic Charter. LEVS: A 100-page document from the International Olympic Committee. China says it makes clear politics should not be linked to the Olympics. JIANG: We hope that the IOC officials can eliminate the disruptions and stick to the clearly-stated principles in the Olympic Charter. LEVS: The charter says, "No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas." It has no say over public streets as the torch travels through. Many who support the protests say China isn't following parts of the charter. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and some other lawmakers say China's lack of certain human rights and its crackdown in Tibet violate the charter's call for a peaceful society dedicated to human dignity. BROWN: The Olympic Charter makes clear the goal of an Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with the spirit of friendship and solidarity and fair play. We should use the games as an impetus to hold that country accountable on fair trade, on religious freedoms, on human rights. LEVS: Can participants in the Olympics try to hold China accountable? Some French athletes want to make a statement with badges reading "For a Better World." The head of the International Olympic Committee says participants may express opinions, but if the charter's prohibition against demonstrations at Olympic events is not enforced... JACQUES ROGGE, IOC PRESIDENT: This will be the end of the spirit of the Olympic Games. LEVS: Olympic organizers are considering what kinds of things may be allowed at the games, whether for participants or spectators. If people try to hold big signs, for example, those could be viewed as demonstrations or political propaganda, and officials could enforce the Olympic Charter. Josh Levs, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEO CLIP) Is this Legit? CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is This Legit? You must be an employee of Wikipedia to make changes on the Web site. Not Legit! The popular, encyclopedia site says that "anyone can edit almost any page." Wikipedia Politics LLOYD: But is what they're putting online always accurate? It's an important issue, especially when the entry is for a public figure like a presidential candidate. There's been some questionable information about this year's White House hopefuls posted on Wikipedia, and some people are studying how it might be affecting the election. Tom Foreman fills us in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM FOREMAN, CNN REPORTER: Three hundred million times a day, people click on Wikipedia for information about chameleons, catastrophes and presidential candidates. And that is where it gets tricky, because for months, supporters of all three have been furiously changing Wikipedia entries to make their choice look good and the opponents look bad. Andrew Rasiej is studying the impact on this election. ANDREW RASIEJ, TECHPRESIDENT.COM FOUNDER: The people who are watching over those pages have to basically act as vigilantes to make sure that the information remains as unbiased as possible. It's a very difficult thing to do. FOREMAN: Volunteers like Dan Rosenthal oversee the Wikiworld, where almost anyone can alter an entry as long as they cite a source. This is something of an intellectual war? DANIEL ROSENTHAL,WIKIPEDIA EDITOR: Yeah, you could characterize it like that. FOREMAN: Over and over, users try to change Obama's page and make him a Muslim; he is not. They have tried to label Hillary Clinton a white supremacist; she is not. And they have accused John McCain of starting a huge fire on an aircraft carrier that took more than 100 lives. He barely escaped with his life in that incident, but he didn't cause it. But some in the Wikiwar will try relentlessly to get a false fact to stick. ROSENTHAL: They bring it up time and again. FOREMAN: Even though it's not true? ROSENTHAL: Even though it's not true. They want it in the article. FOREMAN: All the candidates' pages have been locked at times, and some users are banned, but Wikifans say most edits are well intentioned and worth it. RASIEJ: We're going from top-down politics to bottom-up politics, and the powers that control the future of our country are being realigned around a more participatory citizenry. And the Internet is facilitating that. FOREMAN: The Wikiwars, they say, are really all about changing politics. Tom Foreman, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEO CLIP) Shoutout AZUZ: Time for the Shoutout! In what year was the Rubik's Cube invented? If you think you know the answer, shout it out! Is it: A) 1968, B) 1974, C) 1983 or D) 1987? You've got three seconds -- GO! Professor Rubik invented his famous cube in 1974 to help teach his students about geometry. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Before We Go LLOYD: From a teaching tool to a trendy toy, more than 300 million Rubik's Cubes have been sold worldwide. And just like cup stacking, true talent is all about speed. Photojournalist Scott Wright at our affiliate KUSA caught up with some cubeaholics to check out their fast fingers and solving skills. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLANCY COCHRAN, SPEED CUBE COMPETITOR: When you get to a certain point towards the end, there are certain patterns you recognize. So, you have a sequence of maybe nine moves that perform a certain task. So, you're not really thinking each individual move out. It's more of a sequence that you know. FRANK MORRIS, SPEED CUBE COMPETITOR: Break it down into sections, so that I was only manipulating a few pieces at a time using the same moves over and over again. So, it's really easy to remember. So, I'd have one layer. And I'd use the same moves to put the edges in place so that I have two layers. Then I would solve the last layer. SHELLEY CHANG, SPEED CUBE COMPETITOR:I was the first female blindfold solver in competition, and I've just been the fastest ever since. No one's challenged me for it yet. COCHRAN: I like when I get to the end here. The last sequence I have memorized. I know exactly what to do to fix that sequence. Especially considering that this is the first competition here, they have to work a lot harder to get good attendance, and this is really good. (END VIDEO CLIP) Goodbye LLOYD: Those fleet-fingered fanatics finish off today's show. But we'll be back again tomorrow for more CNN Student News. See you then. I'm Monica Lloyd.

College on edge after recent wave of student suicides From Cassie Spodak, CNN A Cornell University spokesman says three suicides are suspected in the past two months. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Spate of student suicides has Cornell University on alert School dealt with cluster of suicides in late 1990s School has been praised for its comprehensive counseling, prevention programs RELATED TOPICS

(CNN) -- A wave of suicides at Cornell University in the past two semesters is a "public health crisis," the school's mental health initiatives director said. "We are not out of the woods yet," Timothy Marchell said of the school in Ithaca, in upstate New York. Three students committed suicide during the fall 2009 semester, and three are suspected in the past two months, according to university spokesman Simeon Moss. In February, a freshman jumped off a bridge over one of the area's well-known gorges. Last Thursday, the body of a sophomore engineering major was found under similar circumstances. Police are also searching for a body in another suspected suicide witnessed last Friday. The cause of the wave of suicides is unclear, Marchell said. Cornell had no suicides from 2005 to 2008, he added. And the school has consistently fallen within or below the national average for such deaths, said Karen Carr, assistant dean of students at Cornell. The national average is 7.29 suicides per year for every 100,000 students, said Paula Clayton, medical director of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. That means Cornell, with 19,639 students, should average fewer than two suicides a year. The school has been praised by psychologists such as Keith Anderson, chairman of the American College Health Association's Mental Health Best Practices Task Force, for counseling and prevention programs that confront the issue of student suicide with comprehensive training and understanding. Cornell responded to a cluster of suicides in the late 1990s with comprehensive training for members of the university community. Everyone on campus, including janitors, administrators, residential advisers and professors, is trained to look for symptoms of depression. Freshmen are screened for indicators of psychological disorders, and multiple counseling services are available for students in need. "I know that they've been doing a lot of outreach efforts to educate the community. Cornell is kind of a model in some ways," said Anderson, who is a staff psychologist at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, New York. In response to the current wave of suicides, Cornell will "strengthen the capacity of the community to know what to do," Marchell said. "They will be showing non-mental health professionals what role they can play, and help students and faculty get the kind of support that they need." The school also has posted guards to monitor the bridges over the gorges. On Wednesday, campus clubs such as Cornell Minds Matters took part in a school-wide event to promote mental health awareness. David Skorton, who became president of Cornell in 2005, has been praised by counselors for encouraging openness on an issue that many schools try to cover up. In an e-mail to students on Friday, he encouraged them to use the resources available: "If you learn anything at Cornell, please learn to ask for help. It is a sign of wisdom and strength."

'Augmented-reality' windshields and the future of driving
By Brandon Griggs, CNN
updated 10:16 AM EST, Fri January 13, 2012 | Filed under: Innovations
Mercedes showcases a prototype of an augmented reality, gesture-controlled networking system at CES.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Many automotive designers seem to take inspiration from smartphones
Cars are becoming platforms to participate in the digital, networked world Technology is still crude, and several years away from finding its way into vehicles
Mercedes demos an "augmented reality" windshield at CES
Las Vegas (CNN) -- Imagine a future in which icons flash on your car windshield, hologram style, as your car approaches restaurants, stores, historic landmarks or the homes of friends.
Simply point your hand at them, and the icons open to show real-time information: when that bridge over there was built, what band is playing at that nightclub on the left, whether that new café up the street has any tables available. Wave your hand again, and you've made a restaurant reservation.
Mercedes-Benz showed off this vision of the future of driving -- complete with augmented-reality and gesture-controlled features -- this week at the International Consumer Electronics Show.
CES is the world's biggest technology trade show, and carmakers are becoming a bigger presence here. Visitors climbed into a little cockpit at the Mercedes booth and took a brief, interactive and virtual ride through nighttime San Francisco -- with the high-tech windshield as a guide.
Are you sick? There's an app for that Will Apple invade TV space?
Check out the new 3-D TVs
"Gesture is very intuitive. It's very natural," said Vera Schmidt, a user-interface designer with Mercedes who led demonstrations of the technology. "You point at something, and you want to know more about it."
The technology is still crude, and at least several years away from finding its way into Mercedes vehicles. But it illustrates how automakers, while embracing current computer innovation such as dashboard touchscreens and voice-control interfaces, also are keeping an eye further down the road as well.
As digital tech -- and our expectations for it -- becomes more mobile, carmakers are taking notice. Many automotive designers here seem to have taken inspiration from smartphones, with their promise of being always connected and their vast menu of apps for every purpose.
"Cars are becoming platforms to participate in the digital world in a fully networked sense, just like your tablets can and your phones can," said Venkatesh Prasad, a senior technical leader with Ford Motor Co.'s innovation division. "It's our job to take those computing services people are used to at 0 mph and make them available at 70 mph."
Yes, that sounds a little scary. And with escalating concerns about the hazards of distracted driving, automakers must walk a fine line between convenience and safety. Automotive engineers are continually trying to simplify their interfaces to cut down on the precious seconds that a driver's attentions are diverted from the road ahead.
"All of our technology is voice-powered," Ford product manager Julius Marchwicki told CNN's sister network HLN. "So instead of fumbling with your phone ... you keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road."
Sascha Simon, head of advance product planning for Mercedes-Benz USA, agreed: "We determine which apps should be in the car and which shouldn't. We have these apps integrated in such a way that they're actually relevant to you."
For example, say you're running late to a meeting and can't call or text while driving. Mercedes' messaging app will create a menu of logical missives based on your location and your car's speed -- "I'm stuck in traffic," or "I'm just north of Bakersfield" -- and display them on the screen.
You scroll through them and push a button to post the one that fits, instead of having to manually type the words.
Ford this week introduced five new apps for its pioneering Sync hands-free entertainment system, including Roximity, a daily-deals application that provides real-time discounts relevant to a driver's location. Ford is so committed to morphing its vehicles into digital platforms that the company is recruiting developers to create apps for Sync and plans to open a research lab in Silicon Valley this year.
Meanwhile, Mercedes launched the second generation of its mbrace system, which connects drivers with the Web via customized apps that can be controlled by voice commands or on a dashboard touchscreen. Mbrace is now cloud-based, meaning it's always connected and its software can automatically update itself.
Not to be outdone, Audi and Kia also have big presences at CES, and both announced updated versions of their Web-based dashboard entertainment systems.
The boldest advancements in automotive tech, however, may be a few years away. All the major car companies are working on systems that would allow vehicles to talk to each other about road conditions, weather and traffic snarls. For example, a car swerving to avoid a tire in the road could send an instant message alerting surrounding vehicles to the hazard.
Ford also is developing technology that takes a more holistic approach to driver safety and welfare. Instead of focusing on preventing collisions, for example, a car could help diabetic drivers by employing wireless sensors to monitor their glucose levels, said Gary Strumolo, Ford manager of vehicle design and infotronics.
Or a car could help allergy sufferers by monitoring for high-pollen areas, then recirculating air within the vehicle instead of pulling it in from the outside, he said.
Kia is testing something called the "user-centered driving concept," which would emphasize safety by employing an infra-red LED and camera to monitor the driver's face for alertness. The system would recognize whether the driver's eyes are opened or closed, safeguarding against an accident caused by the driver falling asleep.
All these advancements may make driving more interesting. Or they may spoil one of modern society's last refuges from the hyper-connected digital world.
Either way, they are coming soon.
"We're working on a new generation of vehicles that truly serve as digital companions," said Dieter Zetsche, head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, in a keynote speech at CES. "They learn your habits, adapt to your choices, predict you moves and interact with your social network."

Two games in one in 'XCOM: Enemy Unknown'
By Larry Frum, Special to CNN
updated 6:06 PM EDT, Thu October 11, 2012 | Filed under: Gaming and Gadgets
Turn-based "XCOM: Enemy Unknown," offers two games in one, resource management and squad-based strategy.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
"XCOM: Enemy Unknown" combines resource management and combat strategy
Turn-based game is from Sid Meier's Firaxis Games
Designer says the elements felt lacking by themselves
The game was released Tuesday in North America
(CNN) -- It is hard enough to make one good video game. Trying to make two at the same time is a challenge not many developers try to tackle. But the creators of a recently released, turn-based strategy game hope that by blending two differing styles of play in one title they will find a pot of gold at the end of the double rainbow.
"XCOM: Enemy Unknown" is a science fiction, strategy game pitting Earth against an invading alien force. An elite group of soldiers, scientists and engineers from all over the globe is tasked with repelling the aliens and restoring peace to our planet.
While most games take two to three years before hitting the shelf, lead designer Jake Solomon said his split-personality labor of love has taken more than four years to come to fruition.
"I've been trying to make this game for as long as I've been in the industry," he said. "The original 'XCOM' game is my favorite game."
The resource management game mainly takes place in the XCOM headquarters. It is where you find out about each new mission, but also where you tell scientists to start exploring new technology or have engineers build a containment area so you can interrogate alien captives. You'll also have to manage finances, deal with demands from different countries and develop your military force.
Building out the "ant farm," as Solomon calls it, takes some planning by the player, but can result in bonuses if done well.
"Some things are tied into the narrative and you only get one base," he said. "But we wanted players to have an emotional connection to their base. In the (on-base) bar, soldiers who are killed during combat will have their names on a plaque to show you what your victories cost in human lives."
The field squad portion of the game is more about combat tactics, maximizing your weaponry and out-thinking (and out-shooting) the enemy. Squads consist of four to six soldiers, each with their own names, backgrounds and expertise. Use them wisely (i.e., keep them alive) to complete the missions and they get stronger.
The action is still turn-based, so planning and strategy are important at this level as well. Set up your soldiers, hope the aliens walk into your kill zone and cut them down. Guess wrong and players can only watch helplessly as their soldiers get outflanked and end up on the board in the bar.
Solomon said developing the combat portion of the game was fun from the very beginning, but that, for the longest time, the resource part wasn't.
It created a lot of tension and sleepless nights for Solomon and his crew, but they hit on a revelation that helped them find the sweet spot for "XCOM: Enemy Unknown."
"The way it has to work -- they have to feed off each other in a symbiotic relationship. They give each other meaning," he said. "You research lasers and now my favorite soldier has a laser rifle. When I shoot, I see a laser coming out. (The connection between the modes) feels more real because there are all these concrete things behind it."
There was initially a lingering fear with how the game was being developed, he said. Developers ran the risk of alienating players who might like one part of the game, but not the other.
"(Firaxis creative director and 'Civilization' creator) Sid Meier "has a quote -- 'One good game is better than two great games,' " Solomon said, jokingly referring to Meier as "my lord and master." "The danger of having two games in one game is that people are going to enjoy one of them more than the other."
But he said his team tried developing a resource strategy-only game and a combat-only game, and both felt like they were missing something.
The soldiers really had no personal connection to the player in the resource portion and the mission rewards didn't mean as much in the combat game.
"There are some games that have these multiple modes to them, but nothing like this. In 'Starcraft,' you go back to the ship or in 'Diablo,' you go back to the town. Those aren't really games; they are just breaks. In 'XCOM,' you have a game, then you go on to another game."
Trying to find the middle ground took a lot of trial and error. The pendulum kept swinging from overly complicated to overly simplified, Solomon said.
In the end, decisions were made based on how well they worked with both aspects of the game.
"It just came down to stripping out a lot of things that weren't working and getting a flow in there," Solomon said. "You come back to the base and say these things have meaning for me. On the soldier side, deepening the class system and customization became important."
"It was pretty organic. It was a process that I didn't have a road map for."
Solomon was very careful not to tread on the memories of fans of the original "XCOM."
"They have a very large ownership in the game, so it is important to honor the name," he said. "I can't tell you how many nights I've lost sleep worrying about whether I've made the game fun."
Now, players can decide. The game was released Tuesday in North America and comes out Friday in Australia and Europe. The game will be released on both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles as well as for PCs.

Bud, Corona don't mix, Justice says By Matt Smith, CNN
updated 1:57 PM EST, Thu January 31, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Justice tries to block Budweiser, Corona brewers from merging
Anheuser-Busch InBev already owns half of Grupo Modelo
Justice official calls it "a bad deal for American consumers" ABI calls the case "inconsistent with the law, the facts and the reality of the marketplace"
(CNN) -- The U.S. government moved to block the proposed merger of beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev with Mexico's Grupo Modelo on Thursday, with a Justice Department official calling it "a bad deal for American consumers."
ABI already owns about half of Modelo, which brews the popular Corona brand. The Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit accuses ABI of trying to eliminate "a significant competitive threat" from Modelo's Corona brands by purchasing the rest of the Mexican company for a proposed $20.1 billion.
That deal would boost ABI's share of the U.S. beer market grow from about 39% to 46%, the lawsuit states. Add that to the 29% already controlled by No. 2 brewer MillerCoors, and two companies would split about three-quarters of the $80 billion field, said Bill Baer, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division.
"Beer prices have gone up in recent years because of this high concentration," Baer said Thursday morning. "ABI and MillerCoors have been able to drive prices up year after year." Competition from Modelo forces the top two players "to forego the full extent of the price increases that they would otherwise be able to get out of the market," he said.
Opinion: Don't let big brewers win beer wars
The effect has been particularly strong in states with large Latino populations, like California and Texas, the lawsuit states. And the complaint cites company documents that Justice says show ABI complaining about Modelo hindering their ability to raise prices. So letting the deal go ahead would be "a bad deal for American consumers," Baer said.
ABI was created by the 2008 merger of the historic St. Louis-based brewer with Belgium's InBev, producer of European brands like Stella Artois, Bass and Beck's. A company statement called the antitrust suit "inconsistent with the law, the facts and the reality of the marketplace."
"We remain confident in our position, and we intend to vigorously contest the DOJ's action in federal court," the company said. But the lawsuit will mean the deal won't be completed by the end of March, it said.
To avoid antitrust concerns, ABI had proposed selling off Modelo's half-interest in its U.S. importer. But Justice argued that would produce only "a facade of competition" while eliminating a "a particularly aggressive competitor" from the market.
Baer said the Justice Department and ABI had "frank and candid" discussions with the company over the merger, "but at the end of the day, we were just too far apart."

From cancer patient to oncologist
By Rebecca Johnson, Special to CNN
updated 12:04 PM EDT, Wed June 19, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Rebecca Johnson was a medical resident when she was diagnosed with cancer
She was grateful for the opportunity to focus on her patients
Johnson learned to live with uncertainty and find the beauty in life
Editor's note: In the Human Factor, we profile survivors who have overcome the odds. Confronting a life obstacle -- injury, illness or other hardship -- they tapped their inner strength and found resilience they didn't know they possessed. This week, Dr. Sanjay Gupta has the story of a doctor who became a patient, which was an experience that changed her life and career. Dr. Rebecca Johnson was only 27 years old when she was diagnosed with breast cancer at the very hospital where she was training to be a physician. (CNN) -- When I was diagnosed with cancer, my doctor told me I had "a 60% chance of survival, or maybe a little less than that."
Young women with breast cancer do worse than older women, he said, but no one knows exactly why.
During my cancer therapy, I felt well enough to keep working almost full time in my job as a resident physician in internal medicine and pediatrics.
Being at the hospital every day, working with my friends and colleagues, felt comfortable and normal to me. Almost everywhere I looked, I could see patients worse off than I was, and I counted my blessings. I was grateful for the opportunity to focus on someone other than myself by serving my patients.
In those days, I had no idea how much longer I would live. I had a friend who was a four-year cancer survivor, and that seemed like an eternity to me.
My plan for my life constricted. I focused my attention on appreciating every moment and making the most out of each day. Every summer sunrise or shared laugh with a friend was a unique instant in time that I savored.
Lessons learned from surviving cancer 5 times
A special clarity accompanies this type of focus. People with illnesses that might be fatal have an advantage over people who die suddenly. Sick people can learn to appreciate the time they have left and to recognize the splendor of each minute in which they can be happy.
Most importantly, they can tell the people in their lives how much they love them. They can cultivate a state of grace, if they choose to.
As I got further out from my cancer diagnosis, and survived, my focus shifted a bit. I could look ahead. I cherished beautiful moments, but didn't hang on to them so desperately. Cautiously, I began to plan for my future while still appreciating my present.
Now, 17 years have passed. I have been so lucky. I maintain the focused intention of living each day to its fullest. I see my life as an opportunity. A chance to love, to grow, to do good work and to help people in need. To find joy within myself and share it with others. My life goals are simple, sustainable, and within easy reach -- yet challenging enough to last a lifetime.
If there is a trick to thriving in the face of the inherent uncertainty in life, including a serious illness, I would say it is to strive toward achievements that work well in any time frame and enhance your experience in each passing instant -- whether you have a century more, or just a few more minutes, left to live on this planet.

'GMA' anchor Robin Roberts publicly acknowledges she's gay
By Alan Duke, CNN
updated 9:34 AM EST, Tue December 31, 2013
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: First lady Michelle Obama tweets: "I am so happy for you and Amber!"
Roberts has not previously spoken publicly about her sexuality
The ABC anchor thanks "my long time girlfriend, Amber" in a Facebook message Sunday
"At this moment I am at peace and filled with joy and gratitude," she writes
(CNN) -- "Good Morning America" anchor Robin Roberts used a Facebook post to acknowledge what friends and co-workers have long known: She's gay.
Roberts, 53, has been very open about her health battles, but she has not previously spoken publicly about her sexuality.
First lady Michelle Obama tweeted her support to Roberts Monday: "I am so happy for you and Amber! You continue to make us all proud. -mo"
In an end-of-the-year message posted on her Facebook "like" page Sunday, Roberts wrote: "I am grateful for my entire family, my long time girlfriend, Amber, and friends as we prepare to celebrate a glorious new year together."
At a February 14 event called Time to THRIVE, a conference to promote issues of the gay community, Ellen Page announced that she is gay. "I am tired of hiding and I am tired of lying by omission," Page told the crowd. On December 29, "Good Morning America" anchor Robin Roberts came out as a lesbian in a Facebook post reflecting on the past year and thanking fans for their support after her bone marrow transplant. It was also the first public acknowledgment of her partner Amber Laign. "I am grateful for my entire family, my longtime girlfriend Amber, and friends as we prepare to celebrate a glorious new year together," Roberts wrote. See how these other stars have come out in show business:
In a column in the December 1 issue of the New York Times, Maria Bello describes the process of falling in love with her female best friend, Clare, and how that impacted her relationship with her 12-year-old son. British diver Tom Daley used YouTube to announce that he's in a relationship with another man. "Of course, I still fancy girls," he says in his video. "But, I mean, right now I'm datin' a guy and I couldn't be happier."
Bob Harper's confirmation that he's gay came about as a desire to comfort a "Biggest Loser" contestant. On the November 26 episode, personal trainer Harper, 48, talked about his sexuality for the first time on the reality weight loss competition in an effort to show the contestant that he doesn't have to be ashamed. "I'm gay," Harper said. "I knew a very long time ago that I was gay. ... And being gay doesn't mean that you are less than anybody else. It's just who you are." Maulik Pancholy's sexuality wasn't a secret, but he did take the extra step of going on the record about it in November 2013 -- just in case someone out there wasn't clear. The actor, who memorably portrayed the obsessive and loyal assistant Jonathan on "30 Rock," told Out magazine that he's been in a relationship for nine years. "It feels like a nice time to be celebrating something like that, especially on the heels of the DOMA and Prop 8 decisions," the actor said.
Ellen DeGeneres came out shortly after her character Ellen, on an ABC sitcom, came out on-air amid controversy in 1997. "I never wanted to be the lesbian actress," DeGeneres told Time magazine. "I never wanted to be the spokesperson for the gay community. Ever. I did it for my own truth." DeGeneres' current partner, Portia de Rossi, also kept her sexuality a secret for many years.
"Fast & Furious" star Michelle Rodriguez recently told EW "I've gone both ways. I do as I please" while discussing how many have assumed she is gay. "Prison Break" star Wentworth Miller recently came out after he withdrew from the St. Petersburg International Film Festival in protest of Russia's anti-gay policies. Lucas Cruikshank is the star of Nickelodeon's hit series "Fred." He came out via a YouTube video in August 2013. On August 2, Raven-Symone, who played adorable Olivia on "The Cosby Show," indicated for the first time she is a lesbian. She first tweeted the news: "I can finally get married! Yay government! So proud of you." She later released a statement saying, "I was excited to hear today that more states legalized gay marriage. I, however am not currently getting married, but it is great to know I can now, should I wish to."
`NSync singer Lance Bass appeared on the cover of People in August 2006 with the headline "I'm Gay." "I knew that I was in this popular band and I had four other guys' careers in my hand, and I knew that if I ever acted on it or even said (that I was gay), it would overpower everything," Bass told the magazine in explaining why he didn't come out sooner. CNN's Anderson Cooper came out publicly as gay in an e-mail message to the Daily Beast's Andrew Sullivan, which was posted to the site in July 2012.
In May 2012, a New York Times story about "The Normal Heart's" Jim Parsons revealed that the "Big Bang Theory" actor is gay and in a 10-year relationship.
While accepting a humanitarian award in February 2012, "White Collar" star Matt Bomer said he "especially" wanted to thank "my beautiful family: Simon, Kit, Walker, Henry. Thank you for teaching me what unconditional love is." (People magazine identifies "Simon" as his partner, publicist Simon Halls.) Bomer's reveal wasn't overt, but some have congratulated the actor for acknowledging his sexuality, which has been the subject of gossip in the industry.
Actor Zachary Quinto said he was inspired to acknowledge his homosexuality in October 2011 after a 14-year-old, who was apparently being harassed over his sexuality, killed himself. "In light of Jamey's death, it became clear to me in an instant that living a gay life without publicly acknowledging it is simply not enough to make any significant contribution to the immense work that lies ahead on the road to complete equality."
"There had never, ever been a country music artist who had acknowledged his or her homosexuality," Chely Wright told People when she came out in 2010.
Pop singer Ricky Martin declared publicly in March 2010 what he avoided discussing for years. "I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man," Martin wrote on his official website. "I am very blessed to be who I am."
In April 1998, British pop star George Michael told CNN that he was gay. "This is as good of a time as any," the Wham! singer said. "I want to say that I have no problem with people knowing that I'm in a relationship with a man right now. I have not been in a relationship with a woman for almost 10 years." After years as a stand-up comedian and actress, Rosie O'Donnell came out two months before her talk show went off-air in 2002. The announcement came during a comedy routine at the Ovarian Cancer Research benefit at Carolines Comedy Club in New York. "I don't know why people make such a big deal about the gay thing," she said during her act. "People are confused, they're shocked, like this is a big revelation to somebody." She became engaged to partner Michelle Rounds in 2011.
British singer Elton John discussed his bisexuality for the first time in a 1976 Rolling Stones interview. "There's nothing wrong with going to bed with somebody of your own sex," he said. "I think everybody's bisexual to a certain degree. I don't think it's just me. It's not a bad thing to be." John married David Furnish in December 2005.
Stand-up comedian and actress Wanda Sykes announced her sexual orientation -- and her marriage -- in 2008 at a rally for gay marriage. "You know, I don't really talk about my sexual orientation," Sykes said. "I didn't feel like I had to. I was just living my life, not necessarily in the closet, but I was living my life. ... But I got pissed off. They pissed me off. I said, 'You know what? Now I gotta get in your face.' " Sykes was referring to the passage of Proposition 8, banning gay marriage, in California days after her wedding.
Reports of "Sex and the City" star Cynthia Nixon's relationship with Christine Marinoni surfaced in 2004, six years after the television show's premiere. Nixon discussed her relationship with New York Magazine in 2006, saying, "I never felt like there was an unconscious part of me around that woke up or that came out of the closet; there wasn't a struggle; there wasn't an attempt to suppress. I met this woman, I fell in love with her, and I'm a public figure."
Known best as the TV character he played during childhood, Doogie Howser, Neil Patrick Harris has continued his successful acting career as an adult. Harris often walks the red carpet with partner David Burtka, and stars in the hit sitcom "How I Met Your Mother." He told People magazine in 2006 that he is, in fact, gay. "I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man."
"Family Ties" actress Meredith Baxter confirmed in December 2009 rumors that she is a lesbian. "Anyone who's a friend of mine, anyone who knows and cares about me, knows," the actress explained to Matt Lauer on the "Today" show. "It's no secret that I'm gay, but it has been to the greater world." Baxter is in a long-term relationship with a building contractor, Nancy Locke.
He had an 11-year run on "Frasier," but it wasn't until he returned to Broadway in 2007 that David Hyde Pierce confirmed his sexuality. The actor is married to writer/producer/director Brian Hargrove. Pierce first talked about his partner in an Associated Press interview about his Tony-nominated performance in "Curtains."

Support for Robin Roberts signals change
Don Lemon: People should 'come out'
While Roberts did not give her girlfriend's last name, People magazine identified her as Amber Laign, a licensed massage therapist from San Francisco whom she met through mutual friends a decade ago.
It was ABC's Roberts whom President Barack Obama chose in May 2012 for his landmark interview to acknowledge his support for same-sex marriage.
Roberts has kept few secrets about her health. She wrote and spoke extensively about her battle with breast cancer in 2008 and again in 2012 when she underwent a bone marrow transplant to treat a rare blood disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome.
Sunday's Facebook posting came on the first anniversary of the 100th day of her recovery from the transplant.
"At this moment I am at peace and filled with joy and gratitude," she wrote. "I am grateful to God, my doctors and nurses for my restored good health. I am grateful for my sister, Sally-Ann, for being my donor and giving me the gift of life. I am grateful for my entire family, my long time girlfriend, Amber, and friends as we prepare to celebrate a glorious new year together. I am grateful for the many prayers and well wishes for my recovery. I return every one of them to you 100 fold. On this last Sunday of 2013 I encourage you to reflect on what you are grateful for too."
