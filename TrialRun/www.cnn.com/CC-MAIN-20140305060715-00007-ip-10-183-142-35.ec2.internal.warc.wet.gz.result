Gates donates $750 million to fight AIDS, TB and malaria
By Irene Chapple, CNN
updated 2:35 PM EST, Thu January 26, 2012
Microsoft founder Bill Gates speaks Thursday at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: The Gates Foundation has already contributed $650 million to the Global Fund
Gates announces a new donation of $750 million to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria
"I can't think of more important work," the Microsoft co-founder says
Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will inject $750 million into the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates announced Thursday at the World Economic Forum.
The donation comes in the form of a promissory note, not as cash, which the Gates Foundation said "gives the Global Fund the flexibility and authority to distribute funds efficiently based on immediate needs."
"By supporting the Global Fund, we can help to change the fortunes of the poorest countries in the world," Gates said in a statement. "I can't think of more important work."
At a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gates said the funds could be used immediately to "saves lives, whether it is bed nets (to protect against mosquitoes carrying malaria) or TB (tuberculosis) treatment, those are two diseases that don't get perhaps the visibility of the work done in HIV but they are every bit as important."
The investment comes on top of $650 million the Gates Foundation has already contributed since the Global Fund was launched 10 years ago.
The fund has been under scrutiny after controversy over the possible misuse of funds. Dr. Michel Kazatchkine, executive director of the fund, said Tuesday he would resign in March after leading the organization for five years. Kazatchkine cited the fund's decision to appoint a general manager as part of its "ambitions transformation plan" as the reason for his departure.
Speaking to journalists with Simon Bland, the Global Fund's chair, Gates downplayed the controversy.
The way it had been written about was "pretty disappointing," he said. "If you are going to do health programs in Africa, you are going to have some percentage that is misused."
"The interest is saving lives," Gates said, adding there were "all sorts of things that are going on that far overwhelm any amount of misdirection or whatever it was."

10 best motorcycle roads in the U.S.
By Carla King, Lonely Planet
updated 1:09 PM EDT, Tue June 12, 2012
Smooth pavement with plenty of twists makes for great riding.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Coastal Highway 1 in Maine is dotted with over 60 lighthouses
Watch out for mountain goats and bighorn sheep on Going to the Sun Road in Montana
Salt air and slow speed get you onto island time on the Florida Keys' Overseas Highway
(Lonely Planet) -- A great road is a great road, but if you're riding a motorcycle, you're looking for something special: twisties, vistas, turnouts, that perfect stretch of smooth tarmac, and biker-friendly stops that make getting there most of the fun. Here are 10 of the best roads across America for an unforgettable motorcycle journey:
1. Pacific Coast Highway (Hwy 1): 1700 miles from Astoria, Oregon to San Juan Capistrano, California
This undisputed champion of road trips presents beaches, cliffs, redwood forests, sleepy seaside towns, hot tub B&Bs, and world-class dining along a ribbon of winding, undulating road that (between RVs) can provide thrilling sport riding and contented cruising. Stop at the frequent turnouts, and don't miss wild Olympic Peninsula, rustic Big Sur, Hearst Castle, bikini-clad Malibu, or biker-friendly Seattle, San Francisco, and San Diego.

2. Appalachian Mountains: 770 miles from Front Royal, Virginia to Deal's Gap, North Carolina
This four-in-one magic mountain ride begins with Skyline Drive in Virginia, a 105-mile run along the ridge of the Shenandoah National Park, conveniently connected with the Blue Ridge Parkway for 469 miles of smooth roads and sweeping blacktop. Ride east to Tellico Plains along the Cherohala Skyway (Hwy 28) descending into Tennessee backcountry. Loop back via Hwys 360 and 72 to Deal's Gap, and take on the internationally famous 11 mile Tail of the Dragon and whip through those 318 curves for some bragging rights.

3. River Road, (FM 170): 120 miles from Terlingua to Candelaria, Big Bend, Texas
Farm to Market 170 is all smooth heavenly pavement along the Rio Grande through the Big Bend's Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem with its mountains, canyons, badlands, and stunted forests, and even grandma's Buick can handle the 17 mile off-road loop through the Valley of the Gods. But if you've got a dual-sport, you're going to be in heaven. Once it reopens (progressing well at the time of writing), you'll be able to ride on a boat over the Rio Grande at the Boquillas Crossing for a short jaunt for lunch on the Mexican side of the border.

4. Going to the Sun Road: 50 miles in Glacier National Park, Montana
Before this two-hour, 50-mile ride over Logan Pass was completed, it took visitors several days to get through the park, which speaks of its height and contortions. Watch out for mountain goats and bighorn sheep, and pull over at the Jackson Glacier Overlook to take in the most spectacular scenery in the park.

5. Beartooth Highway, (US 212): 68 Miles in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming
Squiggle along for a couple of hours over the highest highway in the Northern Rockies as it twists and turns its way up to 10,947 feet at Beartooth Pass in Wyoming. Stop to take in views of glacier-laden peaks, alpine plateaus dotted with lakes, waterfalls, and lush forests in one of the most rugged areas in the lower 48 states.
6. Highway 12: 124 miles between Bryce Canyon National Park and Capitol Reef National Park, Utah
Take a psychedelic sunset ride into fantastical sandstone rock formations, canyons, deep blue lakes, and pine forests and all the curves you might expect. Swish along to the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Boulder Mountain, and Red Canyon in Dixie National Forest.
7. Coastal Highway 1: 170 miles from Kittery to Bucksport, Maine
Detours, not twisties, along Maine's 3478 miles of coastline is the point here. The oldest highway on the east coast is dotted with over 60 lighthouses, countless cute towns, antique shops, lobster shacks, and almost 50 peninsulas to explore. The highway connects with many other scenic routes, including a ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
8. Overseas Highway (Hwy 1), Florida, 100 miles from Key Largo to Key West
Put your sun screen on and cruise out onto a narrow stretch of road made of bridges atop a living reef in the turquoise Straits of Florida sandwiched between the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. Join the margarita-saturated tourists in tropical paradise and enjoy the biker-friendly atmosphere. Salt air, sea food, and slow speed get you onto island time in no time flat.
Lonely Planet: Super-sized stops: Roadside attractions worth braking for
9. Route 66: 2200 miles from Chicago to Santa Monica
On just about everybody's bucket list is Route 66. Ride all 2200 miles of this history lesson smothered in kitsch, or just grab a slice or two, like the pies you'll find in endless supply at the many biker-friendly stops between Chicago and Santa Monica.
10. The Great River Road (Hwy 61): 2,552 miles from Itasca State Park, Minnesota to Jackson, Louisiana
GRR 61 is a single route created in 1938 to highlight the 10 states bordering the great Mississippi River from its headwaters in Minnesota to its termination in Louisiana's Cajun Country. Local riders from all 10 states flock to 'their" section of the road, whether it's lined with meadows, cypress swamps, thick forests, limestone cliffs, or wildlife refuges. Industrial areas are easily avoided.

Tightening the tap on '$1 trillion' a year fossil fuel subsidies
By Eoghan Macguire, for CNN
updated 7:24 AM EDT, Wed July 18, 2012
Activist unveil a banner on Copacabana beach to ask world leaders to end fossil fuel subsidies STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Activists called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies at last month's Rio +20 Earth Summit
Subsidies for the fossil fuel sector total $1 trillion annually, according to Oil Change International
OCI says public money should not be going to industries that contribute to climate change
Others believe cutting fossil fuel subsidies could hit the people in the developing world hardest
(CNN) -- Political consensus was hard to find at last month's Rio +20 Earth Summit but there was at least one group speaking with unity on the planet's environmental and economic future.
Hundreds of activists gathered on the city's Copacabana Beach to make a simple demand of their elected leaders and representatives: Commit to ending fossil fuel subsidies, now.
More than a million people around the world -- including actor Robert Redford and comedian Stephen Fry - were quick to lend their support by backing #endfossilfuelsubsidies, an affiliated online campaign.
But as the summit came to a close it became clear that no new enforceable commitments on the issue were to be included in the final version of the Rio agreement text.
For those behind the protest however, the widespread exposure and support afforded the oft ignored subject ensured their efforts still represented a success.

Obama targets oil industry tax breaks
We think it's actually a pretty conservative estimate to say that around $1 trillion dollars is committed to fossil fuel subsidies every yearSteve Kretzmann, Oil Change International
"This all falls into changing our energy usage patterns, which I believe is the pre-eminent challenge of the 21st century," says Steve Kretzmann, founder of Oil Change International, an environmental advocacy group that backs the #endfossilfuelsubsidies campaign.
"The first place to start is to stop putting public money towards fossil fuels," he adds.
"This is not because anybody has it in for the fossil fuel industry. What we're talking about is what the public's money actually should support."
Estimates as to how much this support equates to vary from study to study, as do methods and standards for calculation.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that internationally $409 billion worth of government money flowed into the coffers of the fossil fuel industry in consumption subsidies (designed to make fuel more affordable and accessible to the consumer) in 2010.
A separate study from the U.S. Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that global fossil fuel subsidies will reach $775 billion this year when producer subsidies (designed to facilitate greater fuel production) are added on.
However Kretzmann believes these figures may only be the tip of the iceberg and could actually top $1 trillion every year.
He says there is often a lack of transparency in how some governments report the incentives, with many transferred as hard-to-calculate tax credits.
Kretzmann similarly laments the comparatively sparse investment in renewable energy subsidies (which stood at $66 billion in 2010 according to the IEA) as a wasted opportunity to create less polluting energy sources whilst encouraging growth in the green economy.
"At the end of the day, not only is this bad policy but its also bad economics," he says.
"Long term, renewables are a better option for the environment and the economy. There are multiple studies that show how much more labor intensive renewables are and how they create more jobs per unit of energy created."

What we've got is a bunch of rich countries whose people have used energy to become rich assigning blame for subsidies on those countries that are poorerDan Kish, Institute for Energy Research
However others are more cautious about the consequences that an about-turn in energy policy could create.
"In certain countries and situations, subsidies are essential to peoples way of life," says Dan Kish the deputy vice-president of policy at the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington D.C. based organization that advocates free market energy policies.
Any alteration to this arrangement could cause prices to balloon, weakening development and in the worst case scenario leading to social unrest, he adds.
Kish points out that a large proportion of subsidies are in fact designed to keep fuel prices artificially low, enabling consumers in some of the world's poorest regions access to basic energy products.
"At the G20 they are calling for the end of fossil fuels subsidies but what they are really talking about is the developing world," he says.
"If you want a pejorative to describe the situation ... what we've got is a bunch of rich countries whose people have used energy to become rich assigning blame for subsidies on those countries that are poorer."
See also: The problem with fossil fuel subsidies
Kish also believes that renewables still can't compete with traditional energy sources in terms of their cost effectiveness, accessibility and energy output.
"The only fair way to look at subsidies is to analyze the subsidy per unit of energy produced. On that score the numbers are incredibly slanted against renewables," he says.
"Just because you can make energy from something doesn't mean that it makes sense competitively or economically."
Effective and efficient energy policy in the long term, Kish explains, would see individual countries pursue the sources of energy that are most accessible and affordable to them, be they renewable or fossil fuel.
"The best energy policy is that which makes energy as cheap, reliable and abundant as possible for the most people so that economies can grow," he says.

State Department upheaval follows Benghazi report
By CNN Staff
updated 6:35 AM EST, Thu December 20, 2012
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
NEW: Benghazi report results in 1 resignation, 3 disciplinary administrative leaves Eric Boswell and Charlene Lamb oversaw decisions on security at the diplomatic outpost
Report shows a "massive failure of the State Department at all levels," Rep. Mike Rogers says
CNN/ORC poll: 43% are satisfied with how the Obama administration handled Benghazi Washington (CNN) -- Four State Department officials have been disciplined in the wake of a review of the security failures that led to the deaths of four Americans at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, a department spokeswoman said Wednesday.
One resigned, while three others have been placed on administrative leave and relieved of their duties, said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.
The independent review released Tuesday examining attacks that occurred last September 11 cites "systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies" at the State Department.
The failures resulted in a security plan "that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place," the 39-page unclassified version of the report concludes.
Read the full report Attackers set the U.S. Consulate compound in Benghazi, Libya, on fire on September 11, 2012. The U.S. ambassador and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack.

Photos: Attack on U.S. Consulate in Libya
Cole on 'systemic failures' re: Benghazi
Benghazi three months later, no answers
Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was among those killed in Benghazi.
Eric Boswell, assistant secretary of diplomatic security, resigned, effective immediately, Nuland said.
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Charlene Lamb is among the officials placed on administrative leave, a source told CNN.
Earlier Wednesday, a senior official had told CNN that Lamb and another State Department official had resigned as well.
Boswell and Lamb oversaw security for the Benghazi mission. Lamb testified before Congress about the security precautions. Documents show Lamb denied repeated requests for additional security in Libya.
Veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering, who was chairman of the review board, said the members placed primary blame "at the assistant secretary level, which is in our view the appropriate place to look, where the decision making, in fact, takes place. Where, if you like, the rubber hits the road."
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was recovering from a stomach virus and concussion, ordered the review in the aftermath of the attack. Such reports are mandated by Congress when Americans working on behalf of the U.S. government are killed overseas.
Clinton is expected to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee about the Benghazi attack next month, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, the outgoing chairwoman of the committee, told CNN.
Read Clinton's letter to Rep. Ros-Lehtinen
Deputy Secretaries of State William Burns and Thomas Nides were to testify Thursday before the House and Senate committees.
Pickering and former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen, the review board's vice chairman, visited Capitol Hill Wednesday to brief members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees in private.
"The report makes clear the massive failure of the State Department at all levels, including senior leadership, to take action to protect our government employees abroad," said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican.
Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, who is considered the top prospect for the secretary of state job being vacated by Clinton, said the State Department "has taken a huge step forward to address the lessons learned from Benghazi."
"It's a dangerous world we're in, and I think that this report is going to significantly advance the security interests of those personnel and of our country," Kerry told reporters Wednesday.
Red Clinton's letter to Sen. Kerry A CNN/ORC poll conducted Monday and Tuesday suggests most Americans are dissatisfied with how the Obama administration has handled the aftermath of the attack, but a majority believe that the administration did not attempt to intentionally mislead the American public about that attack.
Four in 10 Americans believe that inaccurate statements by administration officials after the Benghazi attack were intended to mislead the public, while 56% said they thought those statements reflected what the Obama administration believed to be true at the time.
In all, 43% said they are satisfied with the way the Obama administration has handled the matter in the past few months; half said they are dissatisfied.
The review board cited a lack of resources as at least partly to blame for the deaths in Benghazi.
"The solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from Congress to support State Department needs," it said.
The board found that Washington tended "to overemphasize the positive impact of physical security upgrades ... while generally failing to meet Benghazi's repeated requests" to beef up personnel.
The board completed its investigation this week and sent a copy Monday to Clinton, who said in letters to the heads of the Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations Committees that she accepted all of its 29 recommendations. They include strengthening security, adding fire-safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high-threat areas.
The report says "there was no protest prior to the attacks," which were described as "unanticipated in their scale and intensity."
It also cites the Bureau of Diplomatic Security staff as "inadequate" in Benghazi on the day of the attacks and in the months and weeks leading up to it, "despite repeated requests from Special Mission Benghazi and Embassy Tripoli for additional staffing."
The report says there had been a "lack of transparency, responsiveness, and leadership at the senior levels" in Washington, Tripoli and Benghazi.
CNN Poll: Majority dissatisfied but don't think administration misled on Benghazi attack
"Security in Benghazi was not recognized and implemented as a 'shared responsibility' by the bureaus in Washington charged with supporting the post, resulting in stove-piped discussions and decisions on policy and security," it says. "That said, Embassy Tripoli did not demonstrate strong and sustained advocacy with Washington for increased security for Special Mission Benghazi."
The report says the short-term nature of the mission's staff, many of whom were inexperienced U.S. personnel, "resulted in diminished institutional knowledge, continuity and mission capacity."
The mission was also "severely under-resourced with regard to certain needed security equipment," it says.
It singles out for criticism dependence on "poorly skilled" members of the Libyan February 17 Martyrs' Brigade and unarmed local guards who were supposed to provide security. It noted that, at the time of Stevens' visit, militia members "had stopped accompanying Special Mission vehicle movements in protest over salary and working hours."
Though it said there had been no specific, credible threats on the day of the attack, the significance of the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 had led Stevens to hold meetings on the compound on September 11 of this year.
But security systems and the Libyan response "fell short" when the compound was penetrated "by dozens of armed attackers."
The report presents a detailed description of what happened that night. It says Libyan mission guards were not present, local militia fled their posts and "there simply was not enough time for armed U.S. military assets to have made a difference."
The board said it could not determine how a gate at the compound was breached, "but the speed with which attackers entered raised the possibility" that the guards had left it open.
The politics surrounding the events that led to the report have claimed one political casualty, with Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, last week pulling her name from consideration to succeed Clinton. Some Republican senators had said they would put a hold on her nomination if President Barack Obama had submitted it, based on comments, later determined to have been inaccurate, that Rice made in the days after the attack.
Benghazi problems suggest long list of changes for security of diplomats
CNN's Adam Levine and Elise Labott contributed to this report.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Julian Zelizer: 2012 was a year of bitter domestic battles, turbulence overseas
He says the weakness of GOP, renewed strength of liberalism were apparent
Zelizer says the year also highlighted the influence of new immigrants in America
Zelizer: Year ended with a tragic reminder about need to act on gun control
Editor's note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of "Jimmy Carter" and of the new book "Governing America."
(CNN) -- 2012 has been a tumultuous year in American politics. With the presidential election capping off the year, Americans have witnessed a series of bitter domestic battles and turbulent events overseas. As the year closes out, it is worth thinking about some of the most important lessons that politicians and voters can learn from this year as they prepare for 2013.
Here are six:
The Republican brand name is in trouble: The GOP took a drubbing in 2012. To be sure, Mitt Romney ran a problematic campaign. His inability to connect with voters and a number of embarrassing gaffes hurt the chances for Republicans to succeed.

Just as important to the outcome was the party that Romney represented. Voters are not happy with the GOP. Public approval for the party has been extremely low. Congressional Republicans have helped to bring down the party name with their inability to compromise.
Recent polls show that if the nation goes off the fiscal cliff, the Republicans would be blamed. According to a survey by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, 65 percent of people asked for a short word or phrase to describe the GOP came up with something negative. The Republican Party was also the lowest-rated political institution.

The exit polls in November showed that the GOP is out of step with the electorate on a number of big issues, including immigration and gay marriage. If Republicans don't undertake some serious reforms and offer fresh voices, all the new messaging in the world won't help them as the competition starts for 2016.
Opinion: Madness in the air in Washington
America has grown more liberal on cultural and social issues: The election results confirmed what polls have been showing for some time. If the 1960s was a battle over conservative "traditional family values" and liberal ideals of social relations, liberals eventually won. Throughout the year, polls showed, for example, that the public was becoming more tolerant of gay marriage and civil unions. Americans support the view that gay sex should be legal by a margin of 2-1, compared to 1977 when the public was split.
In the election, same-sex marriage was approved in three states, voters in Wisconsin sent to office the first openly gay senator, and two states approved of referendums to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Americans are accepting of social diversity, and expect that the pluralism of the electorate will be reflected by the composition of elected officials in Washington.
While there are some conservative voices who lament these changes and warn of a nation that is veering toward Sodom, a majority are more than comfortable that some of the taboos and social restrictions of earlier eras are fading and that we live in a nation which is more tolerant than ever before. These social and cultural changes will certainly raise more questions about restrictive practices and policies that remain in place while creating pressure for new kinds of leaders who are responsive to these changes.
The Middle East remains a tinderbox: In the years that followed Barack Obama's election, there was some hope that the Middle East could become a calmer region. When revolutions brought down some of the most notorious dictators in the region, many Americans cheered as the fervor for democracy seemed to be riding high.
A look back at 2012's big news
Fiscal cliff: What's next?
Boehner abandons Plan B
But events in 2012 threw some cold water on those hopes. The Muslim Brotherhood won control of the Egyptian government. In Syria, the government brutally cracked down on opponents, reaching the point in December where Obama's administration has started to talk about the possibility of the al-Assad regime using chemical weapons, though the severity of the threat is unclear. The battles between Palestinians and Israel raged with rockets being fired into Tel Aviv and Israelis bombing targets in Gaza.
Although national attention is focused on domestic policy, it is clear that the Middle East has the capacity to command national attention at any moment and remains as explosive as ever.
Our infrastructure needs repair: Hurricane Sandy devastated the Northeast in November, leaving millions of Americans on the East Coast without power and with damaged property. Soon after the hurricane hit, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made an important point. The infrastructure of our cities is outdated and needs to be revamped so that it can withstand current weather patterns. Speaking of the need for levees in New York, Cuomo said: "It is something we're going to have to start thinking about ... The construction of this city did not anticipate these kinds of situations."
Regardless of whether Congress takes action on the issue of climate change, in the short term cities and suburbs must do more work to curtail the kind of damage wreaked by these storms and to mitigate the costs of recovery -- building underground power lines, increasing resources for emergency responders, building state-of-the-art water systems, and constructing effective barriers to block water from flooding.
The new immigrants are a powerful political and social force: As was the case in the turn of the twentieth century when Eastern and Southern Europeans came into this county, massive waves of immigration are remaking the social fabric of the nation. Latino-Americans, Asian-Americans and other new portions of the electorate who have been coming into the country since the reform of immigration laws in 1965 are coming to represent a bigger and bigger portion of the electorate.
Not only are their numbers growing as a voting bloc, but they are more organized and active than ever before, both on election day as well as in policy making.
Soon after the election, The New York Times reported that 600 members of United We Dream, a network of younger immigrants who don't have their papers, met for three days to plan how to lobby for a bill that would enable 11 million illegal immigrants to become legal. One of the leaders, Christina Jimenez, explained: "We have an unprecedented opportunity to engage our parents, our cousins, our abuelitos in this fight." They have both parties scrambling as Democrats are working to fulfill the promises that brought these voters to their side in November, while some Republicans are desperate to dampen the influence of hardline anti-immigration activists in their party.
We need to do something about guns. The year ended with a horrific shooting at an elementary school in Connecticut. When a 20-year-old went on a rampage apparently using guns that had been legally purchased by his mother, the world watched with horror. Several prominent conservative advocates of gun rights, including former congressman and television host Joseph Scarborough as well as Sen. Joe Manchin, made statements indicating that the time has come to impose stricter controls and regulations on the purchase of weapons. "I don't know anybody in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault file," Manchin said.
Over the next few weeks, there will certainly be a big debate about what caused this shooting. People from different perspectives will highlight different issues but making it more difficult for people to get their hands on certain kinds of weapons, while not a cure-all, can only diminish the chances of this happening again.
There are many more lessons but these six stand out. After the trauma of the past week, let's hope the new year starts off with better days.

Ashley Judd, Dario Franchitti to divorce after more than 11 years By CNN Staff
updated 6:03 AM EST, Wed January 30, 2013
Dario Franchitti and Ashley Judd await the start of the 96th Indianapolis 500 on May 27, 2012. Franchitti won the race.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The pair got married in his native Scotland in 2001 Franchitti is a three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Judd says the pair will always be "family forever" (CNN) -- Actress Ashley Judd and champion race car driver Dario Franchitti are ending their marriage after more than 11 years.
A representative for the actress confirmed the news Tuesday.
Best known for movies such as "Double Jeopardy" and "High Crimes," the actress attended Franchitti's races for years. She cheered from the sidelines, wearing floppy hats and cheery sun dresses.
Shortly after the news broke, Judd tweeted that the pair will remain "family forever" despite the divorce.
"Family forever," Franchitti tweeted her back. His tweet was later deleted, but still appeared in a log on his website. 2012: Ashley Judd explores Senate run

The star has said she did not know much about cars, but that changed when she met Franchitti.
Hours before the divorce was announced, Judd responded to a Twitter question about her favorite sports car. She said her taste in cars mirrors that of Franchitti.
"Especially the old Porsches and Ferraris," she tweeted. "He has taught me about the art or the automobile."
The pair got married in his native Scotland in 2001.
In addition to her movie roles, Judd served as a Tennessee delegate at the Democratic National Convention last year. Her attendance sparked speculation that she may be considering a Senate run in her home state of Kentucky.
She also advocates for humanitarian causes, and has traveled to nations such as Cambodia and Rwanda as part of her mission.
Franchitti is a three-time Indianapolis 500 winner.

Google forbids users from reselling, loaning Glass eyewear
By David Kravets and Roberto Baldwin, Wired
updated 11:54 AM EDT, Thu April 18, 2013 | Filed under: Innovations
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Google is barring users of its $1,500 Glass connected eyewear from reselling or loaning them out A limited number of developers received beta versions of the Glass headsets this week
One developer put his Glass headset for sale on eBay, where bidding reached $90,000
Google says it reserves the right to deactivate the connected device
(Wired) -- Google is barring anyone deemed worthy of a pair of its $1,500 Google Glass computer eyewear from selling or even loaning out the highly coveted gadget.
The company's terms of service on the limited-edition wearable computer specifically states, "you may not resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person. If you resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person without Google's authorization, Google reserves the right to deactivate the device, and neither you nor the unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund, product support, or product warranty."
Welcome to the New World, one in which companies are retaining control of their products even after consumers purchase them.
It was bound to happen. Strange as it may sound, you don't actually own much of the software you buy today. You essentially rent it under strict end-user agreements that have withstood judicial scrutiny. Google appears to be among the first to apply such draconian rules to consumer electronics.
Why spend $1,500 for these glasses? "If it takes off like iPhones did, this is going to be part of people's everyday activity, and now we are starting down this path that is going to be completely controlled," said Corynne McSherry, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's intellectual property coordinator. "It's not clear to me what they are doing is unlawful. It's a contract issue."
2012: Google's augmented reality glasses
2012: Google develops 'smart glasses'
The company knows if the eyewear was transferred because each device is registered under the buyer's Google account.
For the moment, not just anybody can buy the eyewear.
Google has created the Silicon Valley equivalent of a velvet rope under its so-called Google Glass Explorers program. If Google liked what you posted on social media under the hashtag #ifihadglassand, Google grants you the opportunity to fork out $1,500 for the Explorer edition of the headset.
Google declined comment. Google also isn't saying when it would lift its velvet rope and whether the same Draconian terms of service would apply when it does lift the velvet rope.
Google's tight rein over the gadget came to light today when one of the first would-be owners of the device abruptly halted an eBay auction because he feared reprisals from Google.
"After getting a message on Twitter from Google saying I had been selected as part of the program a couple weeks ago, it just came to mind if they are giving out to a limited number of people, I could put it out there on eBay and sell it for a lot more than $1,500," said Ed, a Philadelphia man who halted his auction Wednesday. (Wired agreed not to publish his last name as a condition of him telling his story.)
Because the only correspondence Ed has had with Google is the initial tweet about his acceptance into the program, he had no idea he wasn't allowed to sell his Google Glass, which he had been authorized to purchase for $1,500 in the coming weeks. Instead, he found out via the Glass Explorers Google+ group.
He also discovered that some were upset that he had the audacity to sell his Google Glass headset.
"People were acting like I had did something sacrilegious," he said.
Once Ed learned of the terms of service, he ended the auction — which began at $5,000 and ballooned to more than $90,000. No one from Google or eBay had contacted him about the auction, he said. He still wants his Google Glass Explorer headset and hopes that Google doesn't hold it against him for trying to sell the device.
"I'm willing to fork up the $1,500 for it," he said.
The tech world, including Google, won an approval-of-sorts to control its stream of commerce in 2010, when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said licensing language controls resales.
The case concerned a dispute about whether a California man could resell Autodesk software on eBay. Autodesk prevailed in a lawsuit, and the San Francisco-based appeals court pointed out that the shrink-wrap agreement between its customers forbade the resale of it.
The Software & Information Industry Association, whose members include Google, Adobe, McAfee, Oracle and dozens of others, urged the court to rule as it did. The Motion Picture Association of America also sided with Autodesk.
Federal regulators cited that decision last year (.pdf) when it blocked mobile-phone owners from lawfully unlocking their phones to run on a compatible carrier of choice, saying the ruling was "controlling precedent." That's because people don't own the software on their phones that controls access to carrier networks, regulators said.
For Ed, it's all a lost opportunity to cash in on being one of the first selected to buy Google Glass.
It would have been "exciting," he said, "to get $100,000 for something that only costs $1,500."

Pro-Morsy students battle police outside top Cairo university
From Reza Sayah, CNN
updated 9:03 PM EDT, Sun October 20, 2013
Riot police run toward students outside the al-Azhar University in Cairo on Sunday during a pro-Morsy demonstration.
STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Police break up protest at al-Azhar University with tear gas
Students had been chanting and throwing rocks, government says
Protests have wracked Egypt since the July coup that ousted Mohamed Morsy
(CNN) -- Tear gas shrouded the streets outside the Sunni Muslim world's most prestigious university after Egyptian police battled thousands of pro-Muslim Brotherhood demonstrators Sunday in Cairo, authorities reported.
There were no immediate reports of injuries from the protest, the latest in a wave of sometimes-deadly demonstrations since the summer coup that deposed Egypt's first democratically elected president.
About 3,000 students from Cairo's al-Azhar University, considered a top center of Islamic scholarship, blocked a road outside the institution, according to Egypt's Interior Ministry. After about half an hour of attempts to persuade them to reopen the roadway, the protesters refused and began chanting anti-military slogans and throwing rocks, the ministry said on its Facebook page.
Police responded with tear gas, driving some protesters back onto the university grounds and arresting others.
Egypt FM on struggle for stability
Protests continue in defiance of regime
Egypt's military stepped in to remove President Mohamed Morsy in July amid protests that brought hundreds of thousands to the streets to demand his resignation. Morsy, who had won office barely a year earlier, and other Brotherhood leaders have been arrested, and a court banned the movement in September.
But the demonstrations have continued, with Morsy's supporters demanding that the generals reinstate his government. Battles between police and protesters left more than 50 dead in early October, spurring the Obama administration to cut off significant military aid to a leading Arab ally.
Egypt's military-backed interim president is reviewing a proposed law that would place strict limits on protests, state-run news outlets reported last week.
The legislation has drawn the ire of human rights groups and both pro- and anti-Morsy political movements. The April 6 Youth Movement, an influential political force deeply involved in Egypt's 2011 revolution, called it "one of the worst repressive laws constraining freedoms in Third World countries and military dictatorships."
